<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loosscru</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, did some math stuff.  Haste being maxed at 105% witha bard that can take you up another 30% and witht the fact(?) that the fastest weapons can go is a 10dly then, by my math, it seems that these 18 dly weapons waste any haste over 88%.  Furthermore, to use max haste (bard+chanter+item to get to 135%) the fastest weapon is a 30 or 31 dly depending on how everything gets rounded.<br />
<br />
So my question is, when i eventually get the 36-41% haste item that will take me to 133-135% haste, what are some of the better weapons with and agro inducing procs at 30-31delays?<br />
<br />
Anything tradeable out there in the 38/30 area?  Don't think so, but a 36/31 may come realy close to windblade dps, just depends again on when the game rounds its numbers and how.<br />
<br />
All i could find that makes use of almost all haste, has a good ratio and Procs some agro is this Stone Etched War Sword (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=18961) wich is somethign to shoot for, but nothing I will be seeing this month.<br />

I think that is a myth based on logs showing even seconds.  There was a Pal/SK weapon that dropped in the game that was 2dam/6 delay, some bixie stinger or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loosscru</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will have to check some more logs, do some more prasing, but so far i have been led to belive its true, mostly because even when hasted to 108% (with a bard) my 18dly weapon only parsed out to 10 dly.  With now minimum speed cap it should have hit 8.28... so 8 or 9 all depending on a bunch of stuff, but it still showed up as a 10.<br />
<br />
I once did see a log witha 9 dly but that person disced riposte on a hasted mob after chanter charm broke.  So, i don't think that counts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well that begs the question, are you absolutely sure you're at 108% haste with your bard? My guess is that you aren't, it's been proven that weapons can go under 10 delay with proper amounts of haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loosscru</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well we did a test at one point.  a 60+ chanter hasted me, with a 59% haste, my sib cloak is at least 26% haste, and the bard was playing warsong, wich is 25% and is v3 haste, so its suposed to stack.  That brings the total up to at least 110.  At 100% haste the 18dly should parse out at 9, no matter how its rounded.  Instead it is parsing out to 10, which incedently is the same dly i get when the bard isn't around, 85% haste at 18dly is between 10 and 11dly depending on rounding.<br />
<br />
Now it could be the parser, it could be log files, it could be any number of things.  But it apears that logs and parsers are able to work in 10ths of seconds so we should be able to see a 9dly.  Again, not saying it can't happen, just saying logs aren't showing it when it does.<br />
<br />
Hmm, just thought of some stuff that may have screwed up the logs and such... im going to go check on that some more.  Ill be back, going to solve this one way or another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm.<br />
<br />
Fellas, correct me if I'm wrong in this. I was under the impression that v3 haste (warsong of the vah shir, etc.) would allow you to exceed the haste cap only if you were at the haste cap with item/v2 (nature's melody/VoG/whatever) haste. That could be a  factor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll try this test tonight, but it should be very easy to prove/disprove whether you can go below 10 delay. Get an unhasted 17 delay weapon (silverfang club is tradeable and cheap) in primary and a shield in secondary. Get capped on haste and go find something you can swing at for over 4 minutes without killing it.<br />
<br />
At 100% haste a 10 delay weapon will swing precisely 200 times in 3 minutes 20 seconds. You will have to factor out double attacks and ripostes as well as counting misses.<br />
<br />
At 100% haste a 8.5 delay weapon will swing precisely 200 times in 2 mintues 50 seconds. Again you will have to factor out double attacks and ripostes as well as counting misses, but with a 30 second difference in the amount of time it takes to get to 200 swings, you should be able to see the difference easily if there is not delay minimum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good point Iskandar, and I think you are correct. You would need to be able to hit 100%+ with just your haste item and spell haste for the bard song to take you over the cap I believe.<br />
<br />
It will be irrelevant when I try tonight, I have 36% worn and I will get SoS (66%) so I should be 102% without a bard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loosscru</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always got the impression that haste stacks as long as its a difrent type.  What i mean here is that without v1 or v2 haste, a bard playing warsong should still effect you.  Would be kinda stuipid if it didn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It doesn't, I know that for a fact. Back when Warsong of the Vah Shir first started dropping (and we didn't know what it did), a guild bard I grouped with played it for a little bit. There wasn't any change in our DPS or swing speed so she switched back to standard haste.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hasted yielded more dps than unhasted<br />
<br />
so no 10 delay cap...  the reason why there seems to be a 10 delay cap is eq logs at 1 second intervals so it you are attacking more than 1 x a second, they are just compressed into that second and it seems like u are quading or more...<br />
<br />
could be wrong tho...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 08:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">theres only one real way to prove this: two succesful dual wields and double attacks in one second. unless theres a parser that tells 1/10's of seconds. i can also try if i can get enough haste 11/17 w/ 22% haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 09:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Didn't someone do this test a long time ago?<br />
<br />
The problem is that your parser goes off your log, and your log is split into increments of 1 second each.<br />
<br />
You say anything over 88% haste is wasted with an 18 delay weapon.  Well I had a 17 delay weapon for a long time with my Cowl (36%) haste, and I noticed a difference between Celerity (50%), and Wonderous Rapidity (70%).  If that haste was really wasted, I wouldn't notice a 2% haste difference.<br />
<br />
When our chanter logged and we had to switch back to Shammy haste, mobs died slower.  That's all the proof you need.  There is no 10 delay cap.  There can't be a 10 delay cap, and it's ridiculous that this rumor, started by 1 second increments in a log file, can still exist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loosscru</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Didn't get the chance to check it out today but by using active log moniters (some better then others) you can get 10ths of a second.  The active log parsers don't realy care about what time the log says, it just notes what time the event happend.  Yes they get slowed down a bit over a network, and lag can and does effect them, but not enoug to screw up 10th of a second counts.<br />
<br />
Furthermore even though the log only counts in one second increments you can still tell what kind of delay (especialy if it it below one second) by counting out attacks.  Assume they are all double attacks (as long as you don't have triple attack aa or antyhign) and when you have 5 attacks in one second without a riposte then you probably went below 10 dly.  <br />
<br />
Regardless the logs are good enough to pay attention to it.  I am going to toss together a simple dly monitoring program after i talk to some parser programers about there stuff.<br />
<br />
Going to solve this one.....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loosscru</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 05:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good info but troubling.... <br />
<br />
Assumeing each of those seoconds of log files is a dual weild with double attack then you are posting 8 attacks a second, which is 4 swings a second, which is 2 attacks a second with each weapon, or a 5 delay.  At 17 base delay you sould need 141% haste to get to a 5.  So this leads me to one of a number of conclusions, either:<br />
[list=a]<br />
 The haste cap is higher then 105%<br />
 you are misreporting something<br />
 the partial logs you posted aren't giving the whole picture<br />
[/list=a]I am going with C here, as i have no reason to believe B, and this is the only information i have ever heard about that sugests the v1 + v2 cap is above 105%.  Again, any of those are possible but i would need some more info to get a better idea.<br />
<br />
What kind of v1, v2 and v3 haste did you have?  Could any of those attacks added in be riposte?  If so, do you have double riposte?  And probably the most important is, why the big time jumps int he reports?  3 seconds of continuos log would be more usefull, and any 3 seconds would do for a quick estimate.  The EQlog files lie about time.  Its only by getting a large sample size that the margin of error can be taken down enough to get useable information.<br />
<br />
Lastly, when both weaons are of the same attack it makes finding haste effects harder because you can't distinguish between primary and secondary attacks.  For more usefull info put any other type of weapon, (1hb, 1hp) into the secondary, or just none at all.<br />
<br />
Edit*at 135% haste you could be posting a 5.5 delay, but we can't tell without a bigger sample.  Good work, and keep logs comming.<br />
If you can post a large (multi fight) txt log to someplace where we can download it and run it through a few programs it might yeild some good info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 05:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Loosscru the question was delay under 10 possible or not.<br />
<br />
And thats the answer.<br />
<br />
Round one .. maybe 5 hits.<br />
Round two .. rest hits <br />
<br />
all togehter in 1 second. <br />
<br />
maybe round one a .015 and round 2 at 0.95 of that second but 2 rounds of combat in one second means delay of under 10 for the weapons. 8/7 normal hits in 1 second of parsing several times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lovax</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 05:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think the thing was that the logs are in 1 second intervals and cram events into seconds so Gerald wasn't trying to show that he was *always* getting 2 attacks per weapon per second (5 delay), just that there were times that the log file would cram them like that, showing less then 1 second inbetween swings (less then 10 delay).<br />
<br />
The log could read the same with 5 - 9 delay.<br />
<br />
Unless I am not understanding correctly =).<br />
<br />
EDIT: Kilaara posted same time as me, doh &gt;_&lt;;;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loosscru</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 05:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everything you guys are saying is correct, im just pointing out that with such small and spaced samples, we can't tell.<br />
It is entirely possible that the log file lagged just a bit during the event.  at T0.95 a combat round takes place but doesn't get written untill T1.03 and then the log catches back up and the next round of combat, a full second after the first one at T1.95 takes place and is writen proparly.  If they were both duel wields with double attacks then you have 8 rounds of combat reported in 1 second.<br />
<br />
The way we can find out is by looking at the logs before and after the event.  Find the average delay of primary swings.  Admitly this is hard to do with fast weapons.  Haste caps are easier to see with big slow weapons, because you can easily filter out the double attacks.  (a fully hasted 50 delay weapon should show at least 1.6seconds between attacks, so anything too close must be a double depending on noticable log lag).<br />
<br />
The easiest way, and what im working on now, is to set up a program monitering the log on a sperate computer.  Ignoring any time stamps and just noteing primary swing attacks.  Im working on it here and there, and it is harder (for me) thus, taking more time, then i first thought it would be.  But maybe one day i will finish it.  Untill then I am going to try and produce a log that will clearly show what is going on one way or another, but logs like this help, just need more info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 07:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When the server is lagging he will give you the infos a a special moment an the next the minimum of weapondelay after it.<br />
<br />
That means when delay is 10 then there is always only one combat round in one second of the log.<br />
<br />
And when the server is lagging for 5 seconds .. the client will get the Informating part by part ... second per second and not as a bunch stapeled.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not saying I hit like that all the time. If you notice, the samples I provided are several seconds apart. Think of it like the rounding on your experience bar. Sometimes when you kill a mob, you'll get 1 percent, then next mob 2 percent, then 1 percent, then 2 percent. <br />
<br />
Say you get 1.3 percent actual experience per mob kill. Every time you kill a mob, it's going to add 1 percent until you kill mob #4. <br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
0 % - 0<br />
<br />
1 % - 1.3<br />
<br />
2 % - 2.6<br />
<br />
3 % - 3.9<br />
<br />
5 % - 5.2<br />
<br />
I know this has nothing to do with delay but it's probably an anology you'll easier understand.<br />
<br />
On the same note, you'll swing, say once a second according to the log, but every 2 or 3 rounds of attack, it'll appear like you got in a whole extra set of attacks. It's not because you recieved extra attacks, it's the delay being faster than the log will show with its 1 second intervals, MUCH like how you didn't get an extra percentage of experience above, even though you jumped from 3 to 5 percent. The experience bar can only show in 1 percent intervals much like the log. It's just math. Do the math :p.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't, I know that for a fact. Back when Warsong of the Vah Shir first started dropping (and we didn't know what it did), a guild bard I grouped with played it for a little bit. There wasn't any change in our DPS or swing speed so she switched back to standard haste.  <br />
<br />
 There was a bug with the bard overhaste songs originally. If you weren't capped they wouldn't haste you. Or even would slow you some. They fixed it. Fairly sure the V3 hastes now give effect no matter what, but not positive. They certainly don't slow you anymore though=P<br />
<br />
 And 100 is the haste cap, not 105...some monk tested it extensively awhile back.<br />
<br />
 As for 10dly cap, I thought that myth died with &quot;No stam makes me attack slow!&quot; and camp proximity checks.<br />
<br />
PS: 1st one to mention 'But with stam under 100 it DOES make you attack slow&quot; gets a kick in the bird.</div></div><hr />
