<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I usually look at newest posts about 5 times a day...<br />
<br />
4 at work, 1 at home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donnel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That all depends on how busy it is here. Like this morning, I had one emergency after another, but I try to at least stay on top of what is going on. So... maybe around 6 or so 'sessions' a day, but I try to read any new info that I find.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm still trying to be a good warrior LOL.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW as a side note, I got a compliment form a SK last night about my damage output /boggle.<br />
<br />
Nice guy I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I check this forum usually 5 or 6 times a day some at home some at work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Damn you all have computers at work !  <br />
<br />
I have one of them jobs where we consider having electricity without a generator running to be a luxury. Sort of like we consider one of them blue plastic outhouses to be a luxury.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">3 times none anywhere but home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I hit Caster's Realm, Allakhazam's, Unsolved Quests, Serer Boards, Stromm Tavern (new! hehe), WTF Comics (what happened?), my Guild msg board, my Raiding organization msg board, FoH/AL/Triton (sometimes), here, Necro boards, and Necro Stromm boards (new also! yay)<br />
<br />
I start out with 2 IE's up, load CR then Alla's, and when I'm done I move to the next site, when I get to the msg boards, I close the second IE and open new windows (right-click, press &quot;N&quot; timesaver) for all the forums with new posts in it, then go by one-by-one through the threads opening up new windows for new posts that I want to read (I get like 20+ windows per msg board :P) then repeat with all my message boards. Oh and on the way out, I hit the Mark All Forums Read button.<br />
<br />
I do that cycle 3-4 times at home, and at school during 1st period if I have time or feel like it. For some reason I always get embarassed so I do it in a small window and have MS Word with some jibberish that I alt-tab to when the page is loading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I visit this site at work at least two three times an hour,  the rest of the time I visit all other EQ related sites and read my favorite webcomics.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I check here 3-4 times a day at work, but usually only before work and on my breaks. If things ever get slow here again I'll be visiting much more often.</div></div><hr />
