<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shih00</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently acquired  the Bst acount and I am looking for places to grind AA for him. I realize Bst 's arent the best healers but with the baby Shammy buffs, regen, and the added dps and stuns from the pet I think it'll be alright. <br />
<br />
Looking for a place that'll be low db to the War so I'm at least getting some AA, at least until I get Paragon for Bst then going to raise him to 65.<br />
<br />
Thanks very much</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Try Solusek C or Chardok B, and see how that goes.  You might be able to handle harder zones.  However, I'd focus on non-planar zones, regardless of what difficulty level you settle on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Try veksar, I love that zone plus some very nice items drop there that will be an upgrade for your warrior.  The zone is pretty linear so start at the front and work your way to the back until you are at about the right difficultly of spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shih00</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for your input.<br />
<br />
 Veksar worked out well. Its a little crowded on my server at times. <br />
<br />
A guildie recommended The Deep and Ive been there ever since. The entrance mobs are 50% LB to my War but still get about 3%AA every 4 kills. Mostly DB to the BST and getting about 1% aa per kill, about 1% xp per 4 mobs. Gets considerably better when you head a little farther in.  And LOTS of drops in there. Its close to bank and KEI/ Virt.<br />
<br />
So if anyone else is looking for a spot to duo with an even marginal healer like a BST, the Deep is an excellent spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Chardok B<br />
Fungus Grove<br />
Sol. C<br />
Veksar<br />

PoJusice<br />
PoInnovation<br />

Honestly you'd get better xp picking up a random lfg druid/cleric/shaman and hitting up Valor, Storms, BoT and the like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Deeper Nurga<br />

Nice drops, easy cr since nothing sees invis.  Look up the named and PH locations and you can get some decent gear drops as well as decent xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Plane of Mischief forest maybe?  Not sure how hard those mobs hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tinuvil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">PoM is a good spot to solo for a Warrior with EP Equip (if you have to solo)<br />
<br />
So you 2 should be doing fine there,<br />
mobs have low hp - drop almost no loot - and XP is ok but not better than any grp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Arzul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Get the BL to 62 to get a good pet, then hit up Maidens Eye, Griegs End, PoNightmare, PoInnovation, PoJustice.  My wife is a BL and Im a warrior we can duo in PoStorms/Valor easy.  Just remember to be hasted and regen and Spiritual Dominion.  Have Infusion of Spirit, dex, str and Talisman and your good to go.  Pull with slow and taunt the mob off the BL.  Its very easy really.  And use healing will at the end of each fight while BL meds.  Use Stonewall if your getting hit on too hard for BL to be able to keep up with heals.  In the Planes, I switch to 2HS because riposte from the &lt;20 delay weapons makes me take a lot more damage.<br />
<br />
One other thing, cast the pet proc that doesnt cause a knockback.  it helps when 2 boxing.<br />
