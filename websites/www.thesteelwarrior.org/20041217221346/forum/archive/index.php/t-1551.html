<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Choppin</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 04:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What shall we do with those wizards who decide to stand 200 feet away from a non-summoning mob in PoFire/HoH/Tactics/Whereever, and press the nuke button like a rogue presses backstab, causing the mob to run over to him/her while all the melees stand around thinking &quot;where did the mob go?&quot;?<br />
<br />
Well my solution is simple, yet beautiful.<br />
<br />
You'll need some basic reflexes/reaction skillz for this, but trust me, it's worth it.<br />
<br />
As soon as the mob disappears from view and those red &quot;You cannot see your target&quot; (wizards tend to stand way behind the front of the raid) or &quot;Your target is too far away, get closer&quot; messages begins to spam your screen, quickly /assist the target you were on and check if a Wizard appears in your target box.<br />
<br />
Now usually, your immediate reaction should be to run over to the mob and start taunting and /shield-ing the aggro-er... if the aggro-er was any other class but a Wizard.<br />
<br />
So, memorize the names of the Wizards on your raid, and from then on when they appear in your target box after /assisting the trash mob, simply move onto the next mezzed/offtanked mob and call assist after the other one gives you raid exp. Let the Wizard tank.<br />
<br />
You might get badmouthed in /gu /rs /tells /shout from these Wizards after a few of these &quot;short-cuts&quot;, but hey... it's not like they heal or buff you now is it. Who cares! ;)</div></div><hr />

When the ranja lets the Flint Dagger rip, just let HIM taunt the target! Fun every time since blood goes EVERYWHERE!</div></div><hr />
