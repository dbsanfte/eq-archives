What suggestions would you list for them to place in that patch to help with some of the issues such as aggro and damage, etc.?   If any at all.<br />
<br />
I hope my fellow warriors will show some form of class and won't flame or hold you to what you say like it is a promise or something, again just a general question for ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 02:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would be extremely surprised if Absor was to give any response at all to this question, in all seriousness.  As a SoE representive if he were to speculate in the least as to what he personally might think should or shouldn't be in such a patch, he'd be setting up all sorts of expectations for SoE customers that he's in no position to meet.   Very bad idea from a CS point of view.</div></div><hr />

<br />
actually they say meelee class balance.<br />
<br />
question is.. does that include sk/pally/brd/ranger/bl increases as well.<br />
<br />
im leaning to yes. So its probably wont be pure melee only but i could be wrong.</div></div><hr />

Im not so interested in &quot;possible changes to melee&quot; , I would actually like to find out if this is still the plan for a future update.  We've been seeing that message on the EQ website for some time now, and so far no mention of it in any future patches.  Is this still the case?  Hope is all we have at the moment....</div></div><hr />

Why was Blackburrow snubbed in LDoN? =/ I have the fondest memories of that dungeon of all the old world dungeons. Zoning into &quot;The Lair of Fippy&quot; would have been outstanding fun.</div></div><hr />

Absor, are you able to contact the devs to let them know of the class sites?<br />
<br />
Because I think it'd be wise for the devs to look at the class sites to see what they've come up with as far as fixing the game.<br />
<br />
Although if you're not in direct contact with them, I can see how this would be a problem.<br />
<br />
Anywho, at least you're posting. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 09:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only thing I'd be wanting to know is are the hybrids also going to be included in this balancing.  I know they have issues, although not anywhere near as pressing as the pure melee.  However I'm not sure I want the answer to that, since if they're included in the balancing, then that means they could be balanced down (and I know some people will definitely read it as such), so I'll just wait until they figure it out. :D</div></div><hr />

Thanks Absor, and for now I will keep hope alive ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Upem</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 12:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well thanks for posting Absor, just curious is all.  Wasnt asking you as an SOE employee more as a player and fan of EQ but thanks for replying to the post.  Glad to see that some folks dont know it all hehe :D .   I do agree that maybe the devs. should take a look at some of the class sites though, great ideas from fellow players are posted on them.  Have a good one and thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">czai</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 02:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A fix is inc, omg!<br />
<br />
<br />
We've also finally rectified and rebalanced the many pure melee issues. Monks have been given the ability &quot;Reduced Vulnerability&quot;, which reduces by 10 percent per level trained their requirements for food, air, and water. This AA has 10 levels, each costing 5 points. Fully trained, this AA will be the equivalent of permanent enduring breath for this class. We believe this is a significant and final step towards our vision of the monk class as being something you can forget about and leave alone in the corner without it dying.<br />
<br />
With Warriors, there are disturbing indications both that taunt is broken and that warriors with /disc agressive are sometimes drawing agro when they do not wish to. Accordingly, we are fixing this by removing the ability Taunt from warriors and replacing it with a new ability, &quot;Happy Smile&quot;. Fully trained, this will reduce your position on the hate list much as a rogue's evade will. This will permit warriors to do more damage, without ever worrying about grabbing agro from a hyrbid tank.<br />
<br />
In some cases, rogues appear to be approaching wizard and mage damage. Since this is clearly not SoE's vision, we have removed the &quot;backstab&quot; ability from rogues.<br />
<br />
We thank all pure melee classes for their patience, and are pleased to announce that this lengthy melee balancing process is now over! Finally, we will be able to get back to the important issues of enhancing caster and hybrid power. Many exciting changes are coming, including a new AA for bards called &quot;Defensive&quot;, and a new AA for Shadowknights called &quot;Death Touch&quot;.<br />

You're right, his &quot;I have no answer&quot; was in fact an answer.  My bad. *shrug*</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 04:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">think of a company mission statment, theres a high chance that something can come up to fuggle you on the way, such as saying we will spend the first 15 days of the month on the new cast AA revamp and the last 15 on the melee revamp, then finding out the new tanking AA(because they have to stop giving necros carpal tunnle syndrom from pressing forward) has a major bug making it only 70% as usful as they had hoped, so they spend the last 15 tuning it, then next month they split the time up between collection missions, new /find feature. and melee balance, again they fuggled :D<br />
<br />
all kidding aside absor pass this on please, in LDoN make it so the ranger tracking(since its ment to be best) use a /find like feature in a dougon so we dont get screwed on a assassin mission because of a stair well, also discount all plate, leather, chain, for melee classes that dont get use out of the mana that is placed on all of these items, also please make it so i dont have to be that 5% of the time enabled game to use a 50 point life tap from the adventure merchants :) <br />
<br />
thanks for passing that on!</div></div><hr />

Falling through the tree was a right of passage as a newb! Oh look a gnoll pup all alone from the guards......Trast has fallen to his death!</div></div><hr />

<br />
ABSOR - Another question (if you get to page 2 of this thread)<br />
<br />
You've stated that you have no information to share, yet.  Can you give us a date (even a rough guess) as to when you expect to have something to share?  One week?  A month?  Three months?<br />
<br />
I figure there has to be a manager somewhere in SOE that is planning when to finish up melee balancing, from a project management perspective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He'd be wise not to give you a date, since most business's can't keep a timeframe.  When they can't meet that timeframe, then they're gonna take heat for that too (and rightfully so). I'd personally love to have one too, but it's not gonna happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a software developer myself, I can well understand Absor's hesitancy to give any information or to even give a date. <br />
<br />
The aggro related changes may be much more complex to address than we suspect, and there may not even yet be a consensus as to what should be done (we can't even agree among ourselves 100%).  <br />
<br />
However, if I might make one suggestion - it doesn't take a programmer to make a new item.  One thing that you might do that would at least make it clear that you're listening/concerned would be to start introducing some more equipment that says: &quot;WAR&quot;, instead of &quot;WAR PAL SHD BRD CLR&quot;.  Making a warrior version of the LDoN plate, for example would be real nice. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakryn</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 08:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your talking about a problem thats taken over 2 years in the making,dont expect a good fix quickly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boofus</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 08:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think a better question for Absor would be what has he relayed back to the 'powers that be' about warriors.</div></div><hr />
