I've heard conflicting reports that warriors may or may not be able to use Defensive on Kyv Heartstriker Jhiru.  Some say that if you do, he de-aggros on the tank and goes after the healers.  Others say it works fine.<br />
<br />
Can anyone please clarify?<br />
<br />
Thanks much!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barangi~E'ci</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I usually use Furious on engage and then Defensive afterwards if he isn't already dead by then. I've not experienced any aggro shifting tied in with going Defensive. Only things that tend to shift aggro is either low hp aggro due to rampage or somebody overaggroing with debuffs and what have we. And ofcourse the occasional pet that breaks charm mid fight and owns the pet keeper and cleric and who ever else might be near by :p<br />
<br />
In short, I think the stuff about Defensive on final named in tipt is a hoax. Or it used to be true and they changed it before I ever got that far in Tipt.</div></div><hr />

Then his dps basically doubles...and will subsequently hand you your ass and any other body parts on a nice silver platter garnished with a nice side of greens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quas</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've only tried him once so far.  As you enter the final open room/area where he is, we pulled him just too the right of the entrance (near a building, and setup up along the wall).  Is that far enough away that he'll double his DPS, or are we ok there?  I dont remember seeing any &quot;redoubling&quot; message.... but then again, we were so stressed at that point that I prolly would have missed it anyways</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warfust</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I normally pull him to the left hand side by the tent.<br />
<br />
I have not seen the message from there. I would assume your safe as long as you don't pull him past the gate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He tells you something like &quot; I will not waste my time with the likes of you, I will kill your friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then he starts owning them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about stonewall?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viernafein</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once, way back when, I was able to tank Jihru with defensive and had no aggro problems. Luckily, that was when I got my Tipt flag.<br />
<br />
However ever since then, in doing Tipt runs for other flaggings, Defensive, Stonewall, Evasive have done nothing but land me and the group in hot water.<br />
<br />
These days, I make sure I have a good monk to help with pulls (since Tipt can be doable with just the warrior pulling if you know the spawns well enough).  Once the last room is cleared enough, I send the monk to the opposite side of the room the rest of the group is and give him pumice crystals to annul/feign on him.  No idea how many buffs he has, but to be sure, I get the monk to run through 2-3 Crystals on him while the rest of the group gets heal ranges and meds up.<br />
<br />
Once I'm set up, I pull him in with another annul from a pumice crystal and setup with Furious.  From that point on, its just a matter of healers spamming their fast heals and hope their mana keeps up (depending on the dps output of the group)<br />
<br />
I'm personally overly careful taking groups up to Tipt so last room clears take forever with me &gt;&lt; . . .  To be extra safe, we usually only clear 2-3 mobs in his room before I send everyone back down to the last safe room and reclear the path.  We'll reclear that path several times just to be safe from repops and that wandering Ra'tuk while working on clearing that last room.   Any of this can vary of course depending on the dps output of the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good lord how long does it take you to clear the room like that, anyway? The first spawn on the right side can be singled with a bow. I pull that, and sometimes the dude in front of the building. Then I move the group into that corner next to the building, wait for the roaming kyv, clear the kyv by the gate, then the aneuk in front of jhiru, med up and have my friendly ranger dispell pull jhiru and ws tank for a bit. You do realize jhiru's room doesn't repop, right? I can't imagine why you'd want to clear back down the path...<br />
<br />
I haven't dared trying defensive yet, but the conflicting reports make me wonder how consistent his new 'defensive nerf' thingy actually is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viernafein</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I keep groups out of there until the majority of that room's mobs are cleared just to keep from pathing issues. (Mostly due to too many painful lessons about clearing that last room. . . can't even count how many times I've had groups lose right in that last room &gt;&lt;)<br />
<br />
For example, sometimes in using a bard to annul / fade or monk to annul / feign, Jihru likes pathing right into that right corner, before turning around back to his spawn point.  Well, you can only imagine what that can do to a group that wasn't quite ready for him or was still medding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, if you have the time to do it, it's certainly safer to clear. I've wiped in jhiru's room more times than I want to remember due to various stupidity like that, too. I've never  tried to annul him more than once though, so that eliminates his funky pathing walking back for me.<br />
<br />
Do you notice it making a sigificant different when you annul several times?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wrathbane</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow you guys do it the hard way! lol.<br />
<br />
The way ive always done it, is to have an enchanter with total command 3 or whatever the charm AA is, me and another weaponshielder (bard or ranger works best). We  get the chanter a pet ( one of the level 64 hynids, pookas or the cragbeasts), and let it tank the mobs on the way to the boss. Once at the boss, we have the bard or ranger go up and disc weaponshield on him, while the pet is beating on him, then once his disc is about to go down, i AE taunt to grab aggro and go furious, in this time its enough for the pet to finish him off. Each time we do this no one even comes close to dieing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, the pet tends to break while he's supposed to be beating down jhiru's ass though. If he could only focus, ws+furious would be enough to finish the job hehe. <br />
<br />
I don't find it's worthwhile trying to make the pet tank on the way up though, it's not that hard to tank tipt nowadays anyway.  Actually, I'm just as happy to grind the whole way up, I don't find it takes THAT much longer, maybe an extra 1/2 hour or so, depending on the group dps.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
Finding a chanter who's up to the task of running a pet for an hour+ of tipt is a task in and of itself recently, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viernafein</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't get me wrong, I've had some fun Tipt groupmakeups in the past. . .<br />
<br />
Nothing beats down Tipt in terms of sheer dps and speed like 2 enchanters with pets.<br />
<br />
However, lately, Tipt is just simply a pain that I really don't want to do over and over if I can help it.  So long and slow has generally been the pace that works best for safety and few (if any) mishaps.<br />
<br />
As far as annulling him multiple times, consider this. . .<br />
Have you ever watched the mobs in his room? In particular the mobs spawned around him?  You'll notice Jihru getting shaman buffs casted on him, and various other things.  The idea is, besides stripping him of his haste, any and all other possible buffs that could be on him.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, who's to know if you actually stripped him of his haste? (in which case you'll just end up getting a hasted slowed mob instead of simply being slowed)</div></div><hr />

On a side note, the few times I've done it with a charmed pet furious was all the time the pet needed to munch Jhiru alive. Rather anti-climatic really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A hasted slowed mob is just as slow as a slowed unhasted mob.<br />
<br />

<br />
Cily<br />
<br />
Methinks this is incorrect.<br />
<br />
While shakerpaging there is a noticable difference between slowed with a haste buff and haste item vs slow with all forms of haste gone.  A slowed mob with haste will still swing faster and munch your ass quicker than a slowed mob with no haste.  A 4 keg call in FG is not shakable with max shaman slow + haste item/haste spell.  If all haste items are removed it is shakable.<br />
<br />
I've forgotten to click off my haste (haste item bagged) one too many times before going in for the page ... yeah they all lived through the ae and ate me every single time.<br />
<br />
... that is unless mobs act differently in this matter than PC's (which i suppose they might).<br />
<br />
If nothing else, it helps for those situations where he decides to be a resisty little bitch, and you find yourself against a hasted Jhiru after furious falls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Slow prevents haste from working.  You can verify it easily with the 90% slows that mobs have when used on players.  If haste still worked under a 90% slow, it'd be very noticeable (20% attack speed versus 10%).  <br />
<br />
However you can always fail to slow something, so it's always a good idea to remove the haste if you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 11:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How do you explain the shakerpage phenomenon then?<br />
Proc rate with slow and no haste items is something like 90%ish.<br />
Proc rate with slow and haste buff and haste item is closer to 70%ish.<br />
Hence why it's important to remove all haste items and haste buffs before attempting a shakerpage.<br />
Also, after the initial shakerpage when i swapped to 1handers, my swing rate was higher after reequipping my haste item even though slow had not yet been cured.<br />
<br />
I could be wrong .. it just doesn't make sense why it would work for one situation and not another.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Proc rate could be computed using a totally different basis than the formula for the number of melee swings a debuffed hasted mob takes -- which is what we're talking about here.<br />
<br />
Proc rate may still look at your haste (even if it's doing nothing) and use that in the computation -- but it's been verified by tons of people that for melee swings that any slow negates haste entirely. <br />
<br />
Have you never been fighting a mob with a &quot;20% melee slow&quot; AE or some such, and it landed on you, and suddenly you're attacking like half as fast as you were?  This is because it's negating your enchanter haste as well as slowing you by 20%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aramelus</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 12:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jhiru and the Ikkinz single-group trial 1 boss were both nerfed a month or two after GoD came out  due to massive-hybrid-tank whining outcry about how hard they were to tank without defensive.<br />
<br />
Since that point in time, they will both do this 'aggro switch' thing if you use defensive, evasive, or stonewall on them.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Incidentally, if you know what you are doing in Tipt, there are 2 double pulls in the entire zone, those being the left and right buildings containing two-spawns in the &quot;ghost&quot; room.  You certainly don't need a monk.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, to clear the Jhiru room, you need to pull 5 mobs to get him single safely everytime.<br />
<br />
Pull 1 - The dog on the right as you stand at the gate, behind the small wooden barricade.<br />
<br />
Pull 2 - The Ra'tuk just to the dog's left that you just pulled.<br />
<br />
(At this point, move the group inside to where the dog was standing)<br />
<br />
Pull 3 - The Kyv just to the left of the gate as you are looking into the room.<br />
<br />
Pull 4 - The bardspeed Kyv who wanders back and forth, be sure to pull him at his furthest right point on his path -- this can take a bit of waiting.<br />
<br />
Pull 5 - The Aneuk directly in front of Jhiru.  Pull from his front and you will get him single everytime.<br />
<br />
Then pull Jhiru into the center area of his room, and kill him using whatever method you prefer.  *shrug*<br />
<br />
*edit* 5 mobs, my bad :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viernafein</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 02:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Correct hehe ;)<br />
<br />
I only use the monk since he can feign off buff stripping Jihru whereas I can't &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
and for the two double pull areas, it makes it easier to have the monk split ;)<br />
<br />
Needless to say, a well practiced warrior that knows Tipt can make pullers feel a bit useless &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barangi~E'ci</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 04:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, well, I guess I've just been super lucky then. I've done more than 20 Tipt runs easily, getting people from my guild flagged for KT and I've never once noticed aggro shifting to someone else if I used Defensive. I don't use Defensive from the word go tho, always use Furious at engage or after WS runs out if we've brought a Ranger, so I don't know if the longer periode of aggro building before turning on Defensive will have anything to do with it. Or if he's just decided that a Defensive Dwarven tank is not worth shifting your attention from. :p</div></div><hr />

Charm a mob and haste it.  Break charm and slow it.  Write down Mob attack speed.  Recharm Pet.  Cure Slow.  Dispell Haste.  Break charm and slow it.  Write down mob exact attack speed.<br />

Methinks it would be a pretty simple test for anyone with a chanter friend and a Parsing program.</div></div><hr />

My experience is that without a charmed pet, he will ignore you if you go defensive / stonewall / evasive. <br />
<br />
With a charmed pet, he gives the emote, but stays on you if you taunt / ae taunt right after.<br />
<br />
Funky aggro when pet is around maybe? Wouldnt be a first even tho they did change it some a while ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, pet's at the top of the hate list due to dps aggro, but, the 'don't attack pet if there's a PC in range' code means he's whacking on you.  You go defensive, but you're NOT his primary target on the hate list, he's just hitting you because he's not allowed to hit the pet due to another control.<br />
<br />
So, there's a crap bit of code that goes 'if the thing at the top of my hate list goes defensive, move to the next thing on the hate list', but it doesn't take into account the fact that the first thing in the hate list is NOT the thing it's presently beating on.</div></div><hr />
