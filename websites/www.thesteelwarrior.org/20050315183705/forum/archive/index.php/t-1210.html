<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scrab1</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've always done the simple cornering technique for mob positioning in Kael.  Shrink down max, plant ogre butt in corner, let everyone push him on top of you.  Tormax, Vindi, Statue, Idol, AOW it always worked.<br />
<br />
Tonight it was utterly useless.  I would back into the corner, the mob would get pushed right over on top of me, then behind me.  Even the jagged corners at the bottom of the ramp were useless.  The only success I got was using a very obtuse corner (about 120 degrees or so) for tormax.<br />
<br />
It seems like with the last patch for geometry collision the center of a mob is far smaller than that of a PC.  They can get pushed right over you and their center will be behind you.  Thus they spin and you lose butt-exposure position.  No matter how big the mob it will fit behind you into any corner.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else experienced this?  Any easy workarounds?  Any specific geometry I should look for to make a good corner to use?<br />
<br />
Rotating or circle strafeing sucks DPS from the raid, and makes it damn tough to 2 box my cleric in the Ch rotation.  ;)<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I usually try my best to keep him away from the walls for a bit so our rangers can unload trueshot on him, but he always ends up cornered.<br />
<br />
I did have that problem on RC though- pushed right over my head :-/ made for a sloppy kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't played pre-patch, but I noticed a couple of things in my running's yesterday.<br />
<br />
Wurms in skyfire and now getting stuck on top of the rock formations there.  Wurms in ToV are walking into walls (even static ones) and then warping back and walking into them again.  Could be part of the same problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Corner killed Thall Va Kellun in VT without any real problems last night, and he's a much smaller mob than any of the giants in Kael. The only problem I had was getting INTO the corner after we'd pushed him there first. Wound up literally jumping into his center mass and tanked him eye to eye while shrunk :p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sadorf</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We had a corning problem in VT last night after the patch.  The bigger mobs were not a problem, but we could not corner DXXT or the last two blobs with their backs facing out like we usually do.  <br />
<br />
I may be crazy, but it did not seem I was shrinking quite as small as I usually do.  When I tried to position those mobs above in the corner I just got &quot;You cannot see you target&quot; spam, but it looked like I was as far back in the corner as usual.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dairen</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also had problems corner tanking in VT. I&quot;m a halfling and even after shrinking i couldn't corner tank DXV or DXXT. Another tank managed to effectively corner TVK and i managed to corner TXD, mini aten, and the 1 blob i tanked. The other tank couldn't get the other blob cornered. Never could corner aten for more than a few secs.  <br />
      Before this patch it was always just back into a corner. After this patch, it took some work and a bit of luck to actually not get pushed out of the corner. Something definately changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scrab1</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gerald, so you pushed the mob there first then jumped into the corner?  That is similar to how I did tormax and got him positioned right.  I thought it was a result of the geometry rather than trying to jump past it.<br />
<br />
I always backpedal while fighting so I dont get bounced out.   Maybe once a mob is shoved in the far back corner you need to jump to get past it to stick?</div></div><hr />

But on Seru last night in our normal positioning spot rangers couldn't shoot him with bows for some reason. Like he got pushed further in than normal or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brokkah Narrow</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We had that exact problem on Statue/AoW last night.<br />
<br />
Our MT was a troll, double shrunk and he had big problems with statue and AoW (not idol though..) facing outwards from the pin.<br />
<br />
He died to AoW around 50% and I (as a Halfling) took over tanking and had no problems, was using backpedal and lookup to make it certain.<br />
<br />
FYI we were using 90 degree corners - Icewall for statue and one of the lower arena area corners for AoW.<br />
<br />
Would be interested in further comments as our troll was not a happy camper last night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaxxym</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dev's decided that warrior's were way too overpowered and breaking the game balance because the cornering technique allowed them to actually do their job and TANK a mob. So they changed things.<br />
<br />
On the bright side, I understand that now pallies now get a new pop up window then they have been reduced to 0 HPs saying, would you like a free instant CH? Please press 'yes' or else 'yes' in response...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fizz</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have been having this kind of problems in VT since after the last patches but we have come up with this conclusion:<br />
<br />
<br />
 Ogres and Barbs can't corner tank<br />
 Dark elfs, haffers, gnomes and humans can corner tank<br />
 <br />
<br />
A quick look at that list and you can see that no big races can't corner tank anymore, ogre with human illusion crown could corner tank tho so go go gnome illusions :D<br />

Gerald, so you pushed the mob there first then jumped into the corner?  That is similar to how I did tormax and got him positioned right.  I thought it was a result of the geometry rather than trying to jump past it.<br />
<br />

<br />
Yes, we pushed the mob there first. It was the first time we'd ever done him and I didn't think we'd be able to corner tank him but somebody else pointed out we could after we'd already put him there. So after he was there and I couldn't pull him out of the corner because everybody else was too high on the agro list, I jumped up into him and tanked him there :p.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Decaillin</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 05:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild had this problem in VT two nights ago, and I noticed the same things Fizz mentioned. <br />
<br />
When our Barbarian warriors tanked, they were unable to corner anything, even though they had no problems doing so before. (we dont have any Ogre or Troll warriors, so I didnt get to notice if those races had problems also.)<br />
<br />
On the other hand, when our human/dwarf/half elf warriors tanked, we had no problems with cornering.<br />
<br />
I didnt think anything of it at the time, but seeing that others are noticing it also makes me wonder if something was changed.</div></div><hr />

Will check this out when i get on today.</div></div><hr />

Everytime I tried to corner him I got the &quot;cannot see target from here message&quot;.  Ended up fighting him along the wall. AoW was np cornering once I got positioned right.<br />
<br />
I'm a barbarian btw. Will try to get a peck illusion next time I tank I guess until they fix this.</div></div><hr />

Our ogre tank couldnt corner TXD.  Va xi AHR worked thou and RZtW was np for the troll too. All were cornered in 90d corners.<br />
Anybody went to ToV / HoT since patch? All mobs looked like they tried to try to walk around but warped back on their spawnpoint. That includes even the 2 static wurms at HoT entrance.</div></div><hr />

Is going human illusion the only way this will work for large races now?<br />

I just came to terms with being an agnostic ogre and being F'd by the wave of better-than-TOV cultural BS armor.  Now this.  I have no option other than to organize my ogre brothers to walk on washington and demand the discrimination stop!<br />

Thanks for the replies.  Any ogres / trolls out there have a better answer than to camp the human illusion mask?</div></div><hr />

A Barb warrior couldn't corner Statue.  A Half-Elf was able to corner Idol.  The Ogre MT for AoW couldnt corner tank either.  The only thing I noticed was it looked like the game was not letting the Ogre all the way into the Corner almost like it thought he was still unshrunk.  By this I mean I could see the gap between the ogre and the corner but he could not go back any farther.  Since then yes we have been using illusion pots and spells to be small races but I hate this since I like to use Slam instead of Kick:).<br />

We then experienced the same thing on Statue/Idol/Avatar, both for me and for our ogre MT.<br />

tanking KT though, i allowed myself to get beaten into the corner, and that did work ok.<br />
<br />
not sure if its just because i sucked at positioning aow, or due to any change in its mob geometry.  will need to tank him from the start next time to find out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surlok</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vindi I cornered np into Lefta arena ramp corner.<br />
<br />
Statue we used the icewall and I could not corner him.<br />
<br />
Idol/AoW were done at Left arena ramp corner the same as I had done vindi not na hour earlier.<br />
<br />
All mobs were engaged by me and we pushed all mobs into the corners.<br />
<br />
I never had a problem with this before,Like I said Vindi corned fine but Sta/idol and aow all got pushed right into wall,They could hit me but I could not hit them and they were facing out..So I had to drag em out and keep them on the wall.<br />
<br />
We did have a halfing tank but he was 3rd or 4th tank and by then we had been fighting against wall whole time so never bothered with trying to re corner.<br />
<br />
I am a Barb btw.<br />
<br />
I am guessing this has osmehting to do with the Devs fiddling with Luclin animations maybe?<br />
<br />
I had Luclin models on Perhaps those with no cornering issues were using old models? anyone confirm this?<br />

Guess it is gnome war for me in kael now =/</div></div><hr />

The wurms no longer come all the way to the firepot, so you have to push for about a minute from all the way towards the pit (i.e. make sure 2nd static is paci'd) to get them onto the firepot.<br />

Something definitely up with Mob Geometry, etc...<br />

OH yah, other details...I couldnt get back up from the pit at ALL and died a couple times while pulling.<br />

Before the patch that messed things up, we could corner DXV DXX DXXT in the corners w/ the lamp type objects, w/o any worries. Since then, even gnoming tanks hasn't worked for us. Even using tanks that are normally small races, we haven't been able to get it to work in those corners. But we have been able to get TXD and mini aten cornered in the same type of corner.  Do the obtuse corners near the side rooms work for corner tanking these mobs? Or we are just being retarded? or unlucky?</div></div><hr />

Whelp...first time my guild has ever found Statue up...We kill him.  We kill Idol.  We whipe to AoW at 48% (not bad considering we have never killed Statue).<br />
<br />
I was the 2nd tank on all these mobs.  The MT for each 3 changed from a Barbarian (Statue), Troll (Idol), Ogre (AoW).  NONE of those people were able to get them properly corner tanked.  I am a dwarf, and had NO problem at all getting them into the corner.  If we were able to get him into the corner properly, I gurantee we would have won.  I was the only tank to stand up during the 5 minutes or so we lasted before people were getting low health agro from too many riposte.<br />
<br />
Reason I'm mentioning this is because a few days ago someone said this has been fixed.  No it hasn't =(</div></div><hr />
