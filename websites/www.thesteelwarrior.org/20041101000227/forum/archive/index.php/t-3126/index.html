<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So my guild is elemental now, having progressed from doing HoT raids to killing RZTW in the last year.  Yay us.  But our handfull of raids in the elemental planes is showing a disturbing trend towards us getting one plate drop (on average) from clearing all the minis in a given plane.  I was told that Fire was better for plate, but we've been in there twice now and seen zero plate drops.  <br />
<br />
Have the plate drops been nerfed?  Or are we just unlucky?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You are just unlucky. My guild has a hard time getting chain drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Depends on the day. For a long time all we could get was silk and plate. Then we went on a leather/chain streak. We had a stretch of time that our leather/chain wearing apps where getting 3-4 pieces of elem before they even got guilded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mourningloree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">http://raidpoints.bloodofro.com/ele_breakdown.php is a breakdown of my guilds elemental drops by type.  Not sure if it includes the ones that were destroyed but think it does...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is where we were at as of like a week &amp; a half ago or so:<br />
<br />
<br />
 silk leather chain plate total <br />
bracer 18 17 15 20 70 <br />
gloves 15 9 14 33 71 <br />
hat 13 7 8 11 39 <br />
sleeves 14 8 8 21 51<br />
boots 13 8 17 18 56 <br />
total 73 49 62 103 287 <br />
<br />
<br />
damned plat hats so rare!<br />
<br />
Drops do seem streaky though, there was like a two week period where we musta got like 30 plate &amp; silk drops &amp; 0 leather &amp; chain.  Lately its been the opposite, seen 1 plate hat in last month totaly, etc.  For some reason we have chain boots coming outta our ears, think during 9/8-9/13 we got 4 pairs of them /boggle.<br />
<br />
They should make pyronis drop plate hats instead of gloves or remove gloves or sleeves from poeb loot tables or something, we rarely go more than 2 days in a row without getting at least 1 plate gloves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">And as a ranger, Oderry knows all about chain drops...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, for us... we have leather rot all the time...  silk goes to twinks... chain also goes to twinks or rots...<br />
<br />
We still have numerous mains who are not finished with their non-BP/Leg sets of Plate...<br />
<br />
The only reason we kill anything in elemental planes now is for Plate and flagging...<br />
<br />
So yeah Plate is rare for us...  some raids we get 6-8 elemental drops and no plate.  It's still random, but it does suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">only been in EPs about a month, have 2 warriors fully decked and plate from what ive seen drops like water along with silk. Chain + Leather arent dropping for us.......</div></div><hr />
