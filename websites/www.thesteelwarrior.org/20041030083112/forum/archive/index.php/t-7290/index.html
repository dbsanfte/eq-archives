<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grixz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello folks, long time lurker here.<br />
<br />
I have a RZ worshipping Troll that I have played off and on for a few years (2001).<br />
<br />
I have recently decided to buy more armor for him and encountered 2 questions that I am in need of help:<br />
<br />
1) Just the generic consensus of the Endurance stat, do you really seek it out like HP?  I know that it does not carry the weight of importance as HP but does having more Endurance allow you to perform an extra added discipline? or should I just not bother looking for it?<br />
<br />
2) Give a situation between:<br />
<br />
Fierce Heraldic (General RZ)<br />
<br />
  Pros:<br />
     More raw HPs than Crimson Darkscale by about 10 to 15HPs<br />
     Often with DEX<br />
  Cons:<br />
     Less AC than Crimson Darkscale by about 2AC<br />
     No Endurance stat<br />
<br />
Crimson Darkscale (Large race RZ)<br />
<br />
  Pros:<br />
     More AC than Fierce Heraldic by about 2AC<br />
     Endurance stat, usually 10 to 15<br />
  Cons:<br />
     Less raw HPs than Fierce Heraldic by 10 to 15HPs<br />
     No DEX<br />
<br />
I am choosing to take the middle road of a mixiture of both types, thereby splitting the advantages of greater AC and greater HP w/ a few Endurance points.<br />
<br />
Just curious if the loss of DEX and some HPs were worth the added AC and Endurance.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">take your pick of the RZ armour, but as for endurance vs anything?  don't worry about endurance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Worry about HP/AC. Until you are tanking hardcore PoP+ mobs, I would even say that you should put a priority on HP over AC. Everything else is secondary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">HP &gt; AC &gt; Resists .... imo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>BlaydennSL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Use of most of ur disciplines won't hurt your endurance too badly, and it regens pretty quick. Go HP's, then AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For as close as they are in stats id take whatevers cheapest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Been hanging around here long enough for the HP &gt; AC &gt; All argument and have always taken it to heart.<br />
<br />
It's just that I have never heard anyone talk about the &quot;importance&quot; (if any) of Endurance.<br />
<br />
Also, I was really mulling over the 20 HP gain for 2 AC loss on the BP and Greaves, I finally just went for the HPs.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the replies on a much repeated topic  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree with what everybody said and your gear purchases.  I just wanted to say I have been an HP disciple for a long time.  However, I'm currently questing the loyalist shield of honor, which I will lose about 50 HP on (mostly due to sta loss), but will gain about 60 AC (if what I've done playing around on magelo is right).  When I saw that HP loss I was tentative about continuing the quest.  It took some convincing by the higher end warriors here that the AC gain was worth it.  That and I have an ancient sphere of fortitude saved up to slap on it once I finally get it  :D <br />
<br />
Edit: And I agree with what everybody said about endurance.</div></div><hr />

My advice is: Look at each an every item. When I used heraldic I had a full set minus BP and arms. Found out that Crimson Darkskale wambs (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12408) was better than Heraldic wambs (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=13200) for me, because I needed str more at the time. But any way, if I am to answer your question steight out, I'd go with Heraldic.<br />
<br />
Good luck with your upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Really, I've always used the 1ac = 5hp until you reach Elementals.  You don't want to completely ignore AC...I know a warrior who went heavy HP and his AC was looking pretty bad.  Another warrior in my guild went heavy AC, although his HP was kinda low.  When we were in the EPs, guess who had a higher survivability while MA'ing?<br />
<br />
The AC guy.<br />
<br />
Now, you're not in the EPs, so it isnt as relevant, but the point is still the same: don't ignore AC.<br />
<br />
If you're looking at 2ac vs 20hp, go for the 20hp.  If you're looking at 2ac vs 10hp, go for whatever's cheapest.  If you're looking at 3ac vs 10hp, go for the extra AC hands down.<br />
<br />
As for dex, so long as you're maxed with buffs, don't worry about it.  100dex = 0.5ppm, so 8 dex in and of itself really isnt a big difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grixz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks again for everyone's insight.<br />
<br />
I don't want to get too neurotic just thinking stats but I'm usually pretty systematical.<br />
<br />
I'm definely not EP caliber, so actually even more so, I wanted to see how much AC I can get through droppable gear but didn't want to loose too much HPs in the process.<br />
<br />
HP are very important but as the rule goes, even with all the HPs in the world is not going to help when mob quadding 1-2k per hit (ya I know GoD is much more  :) ) will still wipe you pretty quick.<br />
<br />
I read a post long ago that you don't want to &quot;nickel and dime&quot; and lose AC for stats and even some HPs.<br />
<br />
So, I'll try to just follow everyone's lead on HPs but will try to stick to Daabu's 1AC = 5HP rule.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i sort of like the 1ac=5hp rule of thumb. now when trying to choose between two no drop items that you happen to own its fairly straightforward. choose the better one. simple enough. but when purchasing bazaar gear ive noticed that hitpoint gear sometimes have rather insane prices. for example a 25AC/50hp hypothetical item might be priced 10k and a 5AC/80hp item might run 50k. and im thinking sacrificing 20 raw ac to pick up 30 hp isnt even worth it if the prices were the same. much less so if the hp item cost 5 times as much.<br />
<br />
what it tells me is there are a lot of people out there who make their purchasing choices based on the theory that AC isnt good for anything at all. i suggest not falling into that trap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Apokolipse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I agree with what everyone is saying about AC and HP.  But depending on your level and gear, don't ignore Endurance.  Before I had droga weapons and Anger Augs, the Incite/berate line of tomes were a God send when I was grouped with Pally's that stole aggro for fun.  Not to say I would chose it over AC or HP, Never.  But if the AC or HP is close on two items, I'll always take the one with the most endurance, because I want to be able to use Incite when ever the button's not yellow.  But I'm an aggro addict.  I'm happy to die in battle because I got hit too much, rather than see my chanter or cleric go down.  Since my weapons upgrades and Anger augs I don't use incite other than on the initial pull.  But it's nice to have a large Endurance pool.  I use defensive a lot in Bot When we have no CC and we get adds.  But for the most part I agree with everyone else, I built my AC til I broke 1200 and then started working on HP gear.  Now any upgrades I'm looking at have both.  I only wish I had chosen Rallos Zek back in they day, being a low level agnostic sucked!!  <br />
<br />
-Just my 2 cents</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Pig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm not in an uber raiding guild, and I was always in the HP &gt; AC camp, but in the<br />
past month my AC jumped almost 200 pts.  I always fight the same mobs for aa<br />
grinding and I've noticed the minimum I get hit for dropped from 104 to 86.<br />
<br />
Now as I'm inching towards 1800 ac I'm salivating at breaching elementals<br />
and picking up some massive chunks of AC as well as HP gear, cause it<br />
obviously has an affect on damage taken.</div></div><hr />
