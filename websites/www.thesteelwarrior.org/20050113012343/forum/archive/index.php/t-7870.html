Kalanu here. I'd like to find out what issues are most important to you as far as armor, equipment and weapons go. What do we need with respect to issues with gear?<br />

For one, I know that itemization is an issue. We should have more Warrior only equipment available that helps us maintain our HP/AC advantage. <br />

Cultural armor for warriors can be a bit lacking if you are agnostic or non- Rallos Zek. maybe it's time to give tradeskill armor a look, maybe in the coming expansion or just a general revamp. Crafted, droppable, non-diety specific amor and/or more quests for single class gear available for the 50's+ warrior. Either that or change the orante drops from type plate/silk/chain/leather to simplely an orante pattern. It really hurts to see ornate silk molds going for 1500 pp whereas the cheepest plate molds are 50-60K pp in the bazaar. I know casters have always had it easier gearwise, but since SOE refuses to give warriors an equal chance at making pp as casters do, I think it only fair to spread the load to other classes. Having one ornate mold for all classes removes the bottleneck of needing different pieces for each slot and class. That should be fairly easy to implement.<br />
<br />
As it is, a caster prays for a plate drop, so they can roll, and then turn around and sell it in the bazaar and buy 2 or more of their class's pieces.<br />
<br />
I suggest the same model for future quests of similar nature.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 One concern I have is that weapons that proc stun should interrupt higher level mobs. For example, the BBotE only interrupts up to 55, as do most stun weapons. It seems that our weapons that we get 60+ should stun at least up to 60. Also, shields are a big concern. They should be a useful option for warriors. Currently, the aggro cost almost always far outweighs the benefit of the added defensive bonuses. I feel that warriors should have many different equipment options for different encounters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ifyou must know, the reason i asked is because from what i have seen from other boards, there have been some feedback to correspondents already from devs, so i do not think it is irrelevant to know whether this specific issue has been raised by a dev vis a vis warriors. <br />
<br />
the other reason i asked is because i had started to type a response, but it became apparent to me that it wasnt clear if this was a general query or canvassing, in which case it would be more appropriate to give a broader scope of feedback, or it arose out of a specific query, in which case more specific feedback would be appropriate. <br />

<br />
I agree with having a warrior class inate ac/hp mod. I actually decided against it because knights are already crying about the -1 DI advantage, something that take a good long set of parses to see the results, but I can only imagine the outcry they will make if we actually have a noticable tanking difference outside defensive. It hurts just thinking about it, no matter how much I agree with it.<br />
<br />
Mokor, I assume you were addressing me when you said &quot;eh the rest is just a gripe and not useful&quot;, I have to disagree. I used that illustration to make my point, not nit pick about class differences.<br />
<br />
I still think an &quot;armor token&quot; system would be the best way to go with future, even present, quest armor. Turn in the token, vendor bought pattern for the piece you want, and recieve either the quest reward or, in the case of present quests, recieve the specific quest piece required for the existing quests.<br />
<br />
For instance, I could be hunting in PoV with my buddies and an armor token drops. After looting the token, I go to an NPC in PoTranquility and hand him the token and a regular &quot;Plate boot mold&quot; that I bought from a vendor, and in return he hands me an &quot;ornate boot mold&quot;. I take that mold and use it to complete the armor quest that already exists in PoT. Every mob in PoP could have a chance at dropping the mold, with low level mobs have insanely low drop rate, while high level mobs and name have a higher drop rate. This syste, you no longer have to farm for that one armor mold you have left to quest for, because the token can be used for any quest piece, silk/chain/plate/leather, boots, chest, head, hand...doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
That system makes it easy enough to retrofit for existing loot tables and existing quests, while also make new quests easier to implement, and help spread the love, so to speak.<br />
<br />
I have a hard time finding a reason why this system wouldn't work. I'd like the hear everyone else's opinion.<br />
<br />
I do still love the idea of a warrior class inate and visible ac/hp mod, but I think it highly unlikely to ever come about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The question is of course degree. I dont think that a paladin and SK can really hand on heart say that warriors shouldnt have an advantage in normal day to day tanking without discs, after all, we give up all utility to perform this function.<br />
<br />
1 DI adjustment was a good start. I feel there should be some clear light of day though which that 1 DI doesnt give. Whether its the equivalent of 50 ac, 100 ac, 500 hps, that i dont know.</div></div><hr />

If done with warrior only drops, some system that drops a token would be best.  Anyone can use the token and a &quot;plate boot mold&quot; to get the ornate/elemental/qvic mold.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings Kalanu.<br />
<br />
First, I think Fitemore is probably on to something concerning the ability to interrupt higher-level casting mobs. Assuming that if players will eventually be able to level to 70, then mobs will get to be higher level than they are now, mob interrupt could be even more important. Obviously whatever tools are given warriors to interrupt higher-level mobs have to be carefully tested so that two conditions are met: 1) the tools actually do something; 2) the tools are not overpowered.<br />
<br />
I agree with Vikken's point about non-diety cultural armor.<br />
<br />
I agree with Mokor that quest armor ought to be looked at.<br />
<br />
In the case of Vikken's and Mokor's statements, I think both point to very large and very broken elephants in the corner. Neither tradeskill armor nor questable armor has kept up with mudflation. Examine the advice given to young warriors on this board when they ask &quot;What useful armor can I quest to improve myself?&quot; or &quot;Where can I go to kill for an upgrade?&quot; Over and over the answer is: no quests are worth your time, and nothing you can kill will significantly improve you faster than going to the bazaar will. In fact, most of the useless quests in the game were originally designed to require that a warrior bring a group (at least one) with him. That was hard enough to do when the quests were new and the armor was useful. Now you can't really even suggest it with a straight face.<br />
<br />
The way new players get their stuff nowadays is to farm trivial mobs and sell stuff in the bazaar, or wait for an older player in their guild to give them something. Imagine the difference in the quality of game play between two games: one in which you can go out and kill for, quest for, or tradeskill your own armor that is useful at the level you can obtain/make it -- and another in which your class is markedly poor at soloing and the way you get better gear is to kill trivial things for hundreds of hours and then log a bazaar mule on and go play some other game. We don't know what the first game would look like, but the second game is called Everquest.<br />
<br />
Older players of couse just twink their alts and spend a week or two leveling the twinked alt up. No point in them doing any quests either.<br />
<br />
LDoN's armor structural progression actually looks good on paper, until your level 25-52 character actually starts doing the adventures and you realize that the reward rate is so far below the adventure point cost of the armor sets that you simply cannot outfit your character that way. This is not a matter of how much effort you are willing to put in, it's a matter of mathematics: a level 28 character who does 10 adventures and wins all of them might get two levels, but he'll only have 20-25 adventure points. (Not sure my figures are 100% accurate here, but they are close enough). He certainly will not be upgrading his armor at a level-appropriate rate this way: in fact, the harder he tries the faster he will level beyond his ability to upgrade his armor!<br />
<br />
Nor is tradeskilling going to help much. On and off for about a year and a half I've been doing an experiment with a Barb warrior: I wanted to see if he could, without twinkage, loot and make his own armor at a level-useful rate. The answer is not really, no. In theory, the answer of course is yes, but on a practical level, the answer is a decided hell no. The BD cultural armor is, even now, darn nice. But there's very little between fine plate and tundra/fierce.<br />
<br />
So, okay, even granted that essentially all of the sub-ornate armor quests are so completely impractical that almost no one does any of them, and that with mudflation any mob a character is likely to kill won't drop useful armor outside of raids (where the drop rate will be dismally low), and even granted that tradeskills have become something that bored level 65 characters do to help SOE remove excess duped pp from the game, it is reasonable to ask: so what?<br />
<br />
The so what is this: the game doesn't have to be all about farming and buying stuff in the bazaar. If SOE is telling itself that the reason new players are not coming into the game is because the market is &quot;mature&quot; I think they're letting themselves off the hook too easily: people aren't coming into this game because the means by which one advances one's character preclude adventure and necessitate repetitive, boring farming. And, that's the same reason high level, long-time players are tempted to leave the game too.<br />
<br />
Older players bang into similar walls, a bit sooner if they can't play 30 hours a week, a bit later perhaps if they can raid for six hours at a stretch on multiple days of the week.<br />
<br />
One thing that olders players do not do to have more fun is to make untwinked alts for the pure pleasure of lower-level quests and adventures. Why? Because just as such paths are difficult for new players, they ain't that much fun for more experienced players, either.<br />
<br />
The quest system in this game needs a total re-vamp, and however it's done, it ought to acknowledge the effects of mudflation. And the tradeskills need to serve some function other than removing plat from the player economy.<br />
<br />
My sense is that nowadays almost all the quests that are still being done are either progressive, or soloable. Nearly all of them also result in a cool piece of gear. SOE needs to analyze the characteristics of the quests that people still do, and match them against the characteristics of quests that either are not done at all or are done only by high-level characters farming twink gear. Stop designing quests that have the characteristics of the hundreds of quests now in the game that no one completes. Designing quests and tradeskill items no one will bother doing except perhaps as a curiosity is a waste of labor resources for SOE. They drive up SOE's expenses and fail to increase revenue, and the opportunity cost is clearly that some skilled programmers are failing to address other aspects of the game that could be improved.<br />
<br />
I happen to think that if a quest requires a group or two or three of players, then no one will do the quest unless: A) the reward is so good that guilds will want to organize themselves to help individual players get that specific item, or B) the quest might reasonably result in rewards for multiple classes of characters. If a quest requires a tank and healer and a dps melee, why not have the quest result in at least the chance of rewards for all of those classes? why is it always the case that the 11 people who help someone on a quest are doing the quester a big favor? Why couldn't the quester be doing the others a favor by setting up a quest whose final fight might result in rewards for the quester's friends?<br />
<br />
You asked a simple question about gear, and my answer is that the structural aspects of enormous parts of the game need to be revamped in a systematic way.<br />
<br />
As for specific positive suggestions, those are of course much more difficult to come up with. <br />
<br />
If I were in charge of the game, though, I think I would take a hard look at the whole system of drop/no drop gear. Dumping a bunch of better tradeable gear into the game actually won't solve solve the structural problems I've discussed. If warriors get twinked now with BD cultural, then they'll just start twinking with the better &quot;new&quot; stuff and the structural problems I've pointed out will remain the same, only the itemization will have changed. Higher levels will farm trivial content or be doing the same raid 60 times in a row, and new players will farm trivial content.<br />
<br />
Let me repeat myself for a second: if I were in charge of the game, I would take a hard look at the drop/no drop system. I'd explore the possibility of some sort of progressive quests/tradeskills/fights that would allow characters and classes of all levels to transform their low-level quested/made/adventured gear into better and better gear as the character went out and fought/explored more and more.<br />
<br />
As it stands now, dropable gear drives endless farming: low-level characters farming trivial or near trivial mobs over and over to raise the money to buy gear from higher level characters who themselves are killing trivial or near trivial mobs to get that gear. Meanwhile, no-drop gear is either multi-quested (for fees) or is sort of discouraging to the person who fought for it, wears it for a couple of levels, and then has no use for it and can't do anything with it except destroy it. Or let his bot alt loot it in the first place.<br />
<br />
There needs to be a third way.</div></div><hr />

Nope, as has been written here countless times since the Phase 1 Melee Update went into effect, innate Warrior survivabilty advantages are more important to us than the Knightimization issue.<br />
<br />
This can be seen in Warrior opposition to Knights getting anything much beyond Weapon Shield.<br />

Feel free to read the posts or take a poll, but the consencious is that when not using a discipline the survivability gap between Warriors and Knights should be fairly small - this allows the three Plate tanks to be interchangable in experiance groups and add tanking.<br />

Yep I agree.  Knights should be able to tank most mobs.   Bosses on the other hand should be the warriors domain.  Problem is more and more mobs are tough to deal with without defensive disciplines.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps I mis-spoke. It is my understanding that most players in the three plate tank classes and SoE believe:<br />
<br />
1. All three classes need to be acceptable in normal experiance groups.<br />
<br />
2. Knights and SoE seem to have insisted all three classes need to be acceptable in tanking forced one-group content.<br />
<br />
3. Knights need to be able to perform a raid role. This has for quite awhile been not being the raid boss MT or hard hitting offtank mobs and has therefore tended to focus on add tanking normal - not exceptional adds. Knights understandably would like to expand their capability to tougher mobs where Warirors need to use Defensive, but thus far can't since Warriors, not Knights, get a mitigation/avoidance discipline.<br />
<br />
If you are aware that a majority of players disagree with this, then please share where the disaggreement is and who has been voicing it.<br />

I wanted to give a short responce, but I got lost in my own mind and start throwing out all what was crossing my mind, creating so a (too9 long post. This usually creates something uncomprehensible (that's why all my friends decided to give me this surname). Because I am tired now, I haven't (and I won't) read it again to correct spelling and expression in order to help comprehension. So I suggest you to either go directly to the next post or to read (and reread) it carefully to understand what I could have wanted to say.<br />
 *** END OF WARNING ! *** <br />
<br />
when reading the response we gave to SOE last time their asked us something we want for our class (the AA for OoW), we can see two things getting on top of the rest :<br />
1. we ask most for bug fix (collision system mainly but not only) that was afecting more than us.<br />
2. we played around for non relevent things.<br />
<br />
so Ok our first demand as been mainly answered and things will improove this way -&gt; OK, no pb.<br />
on the second demande : if we made such strange demand, it 's because (as I think) we are still unsure of what is going to happen to our class. We crossed alternatively time of great success and fun, and time of frustation.<br />
<br />
I think that our main pb is class balance (which is the worse because it can't be solved). We were the class reference for balancing the others, so all we can do is press the red button when we feel we are losing the edge.<br />
We, warrior were meant not to solo but to be the central member of a group : the tank. However we never got any utility to help the group as a whole because it have have been usefull to solo.<br />
Because when knights don't use their spells their tank ability were barely as good as us (and thus when using their spells we were left behind) the respond with the disciplines system in order to give us a greater potential. This is when tanks were splited  between trash/adds and Boss.<br />
The pb reappeared with GoD being so unfinished and broken. Unfortunatly SOE didn't solve this situation at the moment because they move like &quot;a drunk&quot; (one step to the left, one step back, two step foward, ... ) on this pb.<br />
<br />
So I think things are getting so bad on tank balance in GoD that we need another great split like the Kun. release (but listen, I don't say cloning the answer they gave with the discipline system).<br />
<br />
<br />
As BB said, the pb with the increase of people (and espcially wrrior) moving from EQ to WoW (like me) is the consequence of to simultaning behaviour : GoD relaese in a Beta (or maybe even alpha we could ask) form and its coordination with WoW beta release. Personnaly I love the warrior skill system in WoW (different stance, different skills linked to the stences, skills linked to each other, ...) it give at least the illusion that there is variety of playing style and role, and that our job can't be done by a bot (/autoattack on ; /disc furious ;  /cycling incite ;  if furious down /disc def ; if /assist not /self /taunt  ; if /target enrage /autoattack off  ;  if /target no_longer_enraged /autoattack on ; ...).  I think the disc system nowadays is very close to it (timers being the stences and the disc geing a kid of skill) but in a more static way.<br />
<br />
Then I think our pb comes from game mechanic. <br />
As it has been created, it was based on skills that would give an overall result of fight. <br />
with Kun they increased the system to its limit and created the disc system to futher give overall change of a true fight mechanics (insteed of pumping up temporally the dogde skill we have evasive, insteed of pumping up temporally the defence skill and the AC  we have the def disc that cut in half the variable part of a hit, ...).<br />
with velious they created the AA system because it was impossible to move futher with the original skill system. As they said, the AA system will be flexible so that it will be possible to greatly change game mechanic by tuning the overall effect off everything from the original system. But the behaviour is here : when people ask for more involving in fight they respond by overall modification because they can't do much more.<br />
They tried to create the opening system to involve us in the fight but because it was to hard to impement in a balanced way they stoped. This is they major behaviour, if they want to keep this game played for five or ten more years (I can't remember exactly which time estimation brenlo said at the submit meeting) they will have to create it soon or later.<br />
For a long time we got pb with mob attacking through wall, mob immunity when they touched wall, ... and every time we asked for fixes they responded &quot;sorry guys but we can't because it comes from the very busic fondation of our graphic engine and solving it would means creating a new graphic engine&quot;. And look, they moved to DX9 (hurting a huge part of their subscribers in the process) and created a new graphic engine (without expressingly saying so) to allaw them to give a collision system to this game. And look, month after month, and as many great and horific patch things are getting on the way we asked for so long. <br />
Thus, this means they can (when they dicide so) take the time they need to refund the core base of this game. That's why I say they must revamp the game machanics soon or later (and sooner is better if they want to keep their player with the futur complete release of WoW). <br />
In this new system we can increase the use of different skills and new abbility comming from reaching a new step in a given skill (as for exemple or current kick skill that can stun above a given threholds). This would give a way of balance : every class (or every archetic class) can access to all the skills (let's say 50 skills) at each level you can improve by 5 pts 10 skills up to our choice. thus if a knight want to ba able to use magic, he has to practice spell related skills or if he want to tank better he can practice defencives skills (like dodge, parry, ...). So at the end, if a player train only the melee skills he will reach a greater grade in tanking ability (unlocking new special movement and so) that another player player that has spred his points in to branch (melle and spells) won't reach but it will be is own choice/fault.<br />
the game balance would become a power balance between skill branches and steps insteed of between class (note that on current EQ system, the moree class there is, the more unbalance the game is, because it create more specialisation between classes and thus the hybid classes becomes either too powerfull either too weak either non-unique).<br />
<br />
I understand this is not what you or SoE or other Warrior or other Class might expect from a &quot;what's wrong with you ?&quot; question, but for reading this board for a long time I thing this will create much discussions, flames, trollish comment, crossed argument and debates, and so on.<br />
<br />
So I wish you (all and especially you Tsaotsao) great courage in debating in this future thread,<br />

This is exactly what I have experienced.  It is more profound for the casual player who more or less relies on the Bazaar for upgrades.<br />
<br />
I'm building a warrior as a my new main (Niclet).  I started her with junk gear I had laying around, could farm with ease or could buy (Crusty etc.).  She is now 57 and with Bazaar gear and ONE yes ONE quest item (Loyalty Shield) she is about 4500hps 1400ac unbuffed.  That's with all bazaar gear.  Some ornate, mana threaded wrist, droga weaps, blindeye in range yada yada.<br />
<br />
If I was to &quot;raid&quot; with her, or go for RA gear etc.  I would probably be old and gray before her stats reached that level.  What is my incentive to do ANYTHING but farm at this level of the game?  I think I spent 300-500k on her all from farmed items (mostly from riwwi).<br />
<br />
I 2-boxed Valdanov for the Loyalty Shield with my druid and BL.  I did the pottery combine on my druid, etc. etc.  The only 2 upgrades I can consider at this point from the bazaar are a BoC and Helmet of Rallos Zek combined cost maybe another 500-600k.  And you know what?  I probably will go to the bazaar for them.  Why?  Because there are no reasonable upgrades for her, either by questing or raiding at her level that she can hope to get.  Screw LDoN, too many points for armor, I'd rather buy anger/ac/hp augs anyways.<br />
<br />
This is a broken system!  I buy my junk from some guy that uses his CoD chanter to farm the shit out of Tactics for Ornate bits.  He owns the supply of plate greaves and charges 90k.  This is from a mob I couldn't hope to kill anytime soon.  The incentive is for me to go to the bazaar.<br />
<br />
We are living in a world of haves and have nots.  I'm lucky to have a pair of characters I can effectively 2-box.  Mudflation is detroying EQ.</div></div><hr />

If you don't feel there's a niche in there for knights, your guild just most likely under-utilizes them.  Knights are the kings of locking adds if that wasn't already apparent.  If it's strictly tank mezzing sure a warrior could do it even though knight utility I consider evens the playing field out but in the case of pulling mobs that can be cc'd with mez obviously knights shine as they can lock them down without having to deal with coordinating a thing between your cc team and warriors so they can toggle atk off before mez lands meh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, all Warrior discusions turn sooner or later to class balance and roles.<br />
<br />
SoE has said somewhere that they are re-examining the classes to insure they have a role and a purpose in all environments. I assume these will be class consistant roles. In the case of Knights, this will include tanking (speculation, but I'll bet ya a muffin), not just tanking without doing damge, on raids. At the same time, SoE indicated that traditional class roles will be preserved (Warriors MTing most raid boss mobs IMO).<br />
<br />
I think Warriors accept the justice of doing this, however I'm also convinced there are some questions/issues. We can assume class skill/spell adjustments will be made as needed so classes can perform their (in some cases new or clarified) roles. If Knights (or Paladins only) become preferred add tanks, will Warriors be confined to only MTing boss mobs? What about red hard-hitting adds, splits. plowtanking, RT, etc? What adjustments does SoE have in mind and how will it affect us?<br />
<br />
On the unquestionably plus-side there has been a suggestion that clesses in general (we be concerned with Warriors) will all be able to solo, there will be solo quests/activities/experaince opprotunities.<br />
<br />
Given an indication of changes this far-reaching, Warriors I believe are torn between being extremely hopeful and scared to death that since they don't typically get major changes like stuns effective to level 75 as they level up (our GoD &quot;spell&quot; drop was Bellow) that we will be entirely redundant except on raid day MTing the boss mob.<br />
<br />
Casual players have a whole different set of concerns -just as important to them and just as fundamental. To provide just a taste, even by killing yourself doing LDoN casual players can barely reach near-EP stats. That leaves them half and expansion behind - call it 6-8 months. Add the Advanced GoD zones and that's another 6 months minimum. The game is rapidly being transformed into two games and the one most casual players are in gives them no reasonable prospects to move into the other and see any of the advanced content - not without a year+ of effort, which given their casual playstyle they obviously are unwilling/unable to do. This caual player lag is not getting less, it's growing.<br />
<br />
It was for these reasons that I point out that Warrior specific drops allowing us to maintain an AC/HP &quot;lead&quot; is pretty irrelevent. That concern was largely trumped by the Phase 1 Melee Update and the Sturdyness AA ability. There be MUCH bigger fish to fry.<br />

<br />
-code in a re-cast delay option for clicky items, instead of using excessively long casting times to &quot;balance&quot; them.  This would probably NERF quite a few rather nice items, BUT it would allow addition of &quot;instant cast&quot; but variably-long recycle effects that warriors could actually use when not standing absolutely still.  If they really really don't like that idea, give warriors (and all pure melee for that matter) at least as much channeling as hybrids get.  Or, at a stretch, make pure melee classes like bards with respect to channeling/casting. ;)  <br />
<br />
-Question: what items never get banked or deleted despite being many expansions old?  Answer: clickies or weapons with useful procs.  How about adding auguments and/or up-to-date items with useful effects (like levitation, invisibility, snare/slow/debuff procs, buffs, etc.) so current items can be upgraded, instead of having to carry piles of old-but-priceless gear around.  Pegasus cloak, incardaine bp/cobalt legs/cloudy mask, cobalt bracer, dain hammer, any of a number of now-sub-par snare weapons, truncheon of doom, damage shield clickies, PoM flowers/dain hammer, tash sticks, etc.  I love em, but I'm running out of inventory space...<br />

-helms.  I *liked* the troll &quot;BMX&quot; helmet, but most end-game hats don't have any graphics.  Pure esthetics here,  but how about some options?  &quot;Custom&quot; helms from velious were great imho.<br />

<br />
<br />
When I look at itemization on items such as EP armor I'm struck by how similar the AC/HP is on all plate.  <br />
<br />
If this kind of itemization keeps going, they need to look at giving wars a heftier innate ac/hp bonus.<br />
<br />
Itemization doesn't really strike me as too much of a problem.  I do think all/all armor could stand to make you choose between having more mana plus a caster focus effect, or having more raw hp/ac/end.<br />
<br />
What really worries me is not itemization, but what we'll be getting in OoW.  As many recall, pure melee got nothing but increased hp and more AA choices between 60-65.  If this is to be the case from 65-70 then I am not going to buy OoW.  For people like me who are trying to make the decision to buy OoW, knowing what we'll get will help influence the decision to buy (or not).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I remember correctly on SoE Warrior's boards there was for some time a &quot;wish list&quot; or issues list, unfortunately it appears to be gone. The most striking thing about it was Warrior after Warrior stated that they didn't want or expect much. It would be interesting to see what was on it.<br />
<br />
A couple of minor improvements that would help Warriors without being too imbalanced might be:<br />
<br />
As Semp pointed out elsewhere, there was a self-only DS capability called Barrier. This can still be found on Lucy. In normal experiance groups and soloing the Warrior survival advantage is easily overcome by Paladin stuns/heals/buffing capability and an SK's DS buffs/self-buff/spears/pet. Barrier would be a great help.<br />
<br />
The Invigor BP right-click has become very underpowered at 100HP's. It's only real advantage is that it saves having to cart around bags full of bandages or an Embalmer's Skinning Knife. Even Healing Will is incapable of really reducing Warrior downtime when soloing. I'd like to see SoE review Warrior self-healing from 100HP's to 12K HP's and see just how long it takes.<br />
<br />
Warriors lack any really useful burst damage capability in most experiance groups and soloing in any experiance environment. We can't even seek out a zone containing a high percentage of undead to improve the situation. You have to be near death for Mighty Strike to mean anything. A minimum Crit is downright embarassing as are typical Cripples (for the brief time you are still alive to do them).<br />
<br />
Oh, and hopefully SoE will pay careful attention to Kick/Slam stuns. I don't believe Wariors have any desire to be overpowered in this area, but the ability to interrupt a mob trying to gate is and is likely to remain a Warrior concern.<br />

Well, you don't have stuns.  You may not be &quot;as good&quot;, but are you going to say you wouldn't be complaining if what I said happened?  It is all tied to paladins and stuns.

No I just wanted to make it clear that we didnt have stuns like we didnt have AoTc when they HP increase to warriors was made based on paladins having this and SK's were not thought of and for a long time we had an even bigger hp gap between us and paladins and warriors.<br />

They'd still have the options of going way high on hp/ac and shielding etc. mods, but at a major penalty to their more &quot;knightly&quot; abilities (mana pres and focus, mana regen). <br />
<br />
Then have a second tier of plate items with less godly ac/hp and melee mods, but with stronger mana regen, pres, and focus effects.  If there was a plate arm out there with 80ac, 280hp / 180mana and 5% shielding, it would be considerably less enticing for the non-warrior classes to use over say, a 70ac, 245hp / 245mana arm slot with 5% spell shield, discordant healing, or some effect that might make a difference on all those shitty spells being pawned off on sk's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warriors generally contend that we chose to play a Warrior in order to take the point in battles, use our unmatched survivability and aggro control to MT. We are not &quot;primarily a melee&quot; or a class that enjoys meleeing in battles. We are the class that for as long as memory serves who's Class Description is word for word what all players define a Tank. We are the embodyment of a tank and only a tank.<br />
<br />
Warriors (saying this having followed TSW for quite awile) do not want to be one of three flavors of very nearly equal tanks. At no time were Knights promised to equal Warriors as tanks and have a bonus spellbook.<br />
<br />
Warriors have long established roles. Many of us have played for 4 years and KNOW what class almost without exception raid MT's and which classes do not and never have.<br />
<br />
I'm personally concerned with OoW stuns if there isn't a recourse buff on the mob. Suggesting that in addtion to moving the AC softcap and given vastly superior 1Hdrs that SoE might also give shields a chance to Block (a capability Warriors lack) all potentially threaten the longstanding Warrior calss characteristics - even without disciplines the tank with the greatest capacity to survive a battle with a hard hitting mob.<br />
<br />
If SoE removes our traditional role, redefines the class to Tank/utility (no spellbook), or elevates Knight tanking and/or spellbooks so they are Warrior + Spellbook, I'm certain the exodus of Wariors from EQ will be remarkable.<br />

If they add any additional functionality to shields at all, they would absolutely need to figure out a way to code 1h weapons that are equal to paladin/sk 1h weapons that warriors can only use with shields. If the changes were at all meaningful it would throw things way out of whack to have 2 tanks swinging at 95% of their potential dps with optimal tanking set, and the 3rd swinging at 60-70%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-03-2004, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I stated before, I agree with BB on the core issue of itemisations (including spells).<br />
However I will rephrase my point (from my last post) in a more concise and comprehensible maner.<br />
<br />
<br />
EQ has reached a point with GoD that make its game mechanic unstable. its game mechanics is based on level, skills, items, spells, disciplines, focus and AA.   There is more difference between two warriors lvl 65 with 0/max AA than between a lvl 64 and 65 both without AA.   Skills are outdated cause they reached their limits long ago (anybody see an interest in having 15% taunt bonus or 8% dodge bonus? They created 'improoved dodge' because the normal dodge skill can't give anything more with bonus).    Disciplines have reached their limit (any new disc in OoW? and even if so, what do you expect? an 80% evasive or e 70% defensive : they can't cause it would unbalance everything. only new utility disc can be added safely).    Focus, we are aiming at 50% focus items in the last GoD zone, so combined with spell focuses it definitly brings spell to a degree of power far from their data, to balance it they have to decrease the progression of spell power (see between PoP and GoD it basically the same with 10% increase on every fields).      Thus the only thing that can be tuned currently is items and AA, leaving a very small maneuvrability to the game designers and creating more and more a gear dependancy for tank and melee (and thus the more for Warrior).<br />
<br />
<br />
They already changed the graphic engine with the DX9 patch. They wanted to change a bit fight mechanic with &quot;melee part II (original)&quot;, but abandonned it. If they want to restore game balance they must give flavor to powerfull part of the game that are in a &quot;all or nothing&quot; maner (ie stun, mez, root, aggro spell/proc, disc, ...). but they can't do that right now so they try to give better proc, better gear, better spell, ... and because it &quot;gimps&quot; the game they sparse immunities to flavor the encouters. They can only surprise us with &quot;opposite effect&quot;. I mean, after immunity, focus, shieldind, rune, mirror, the next step would be somrthing like healing a fire elemental with a fire ball (I can imagine a raid facing Sol Ro and, when wizzies throw 'strike of solusek' on him, seeing his heal restored). A way to restore maneuvrability would be to refund game mechanic with actually giving us a true 'melee part II' (the opening should get back, even if it takes six month af tuning),  and creating something like a 'spell memory'. <br />
<br />
The opening system would give more difference between tanks (yes, knights would have this system too) because pure melee would have more/bigger opening with more possibility of response while knights would have them alike but with the drawback of interupting their spells if they choose to use a melee ability (you can't concentrate both on casting and starbing the heart).<br />
While the 'spell memory' would modify the resistance versus the spell's family the mob recieve. for exemple after 4 or 5 stun/mez/root the mob has learned how to resist them and can partially avoid them ; or after hundreds stuns the mob's imunity has got a breach allowing a stun to partially taking hold. And basically, what is a stun ? a 100% speed and movement reduction with a casting interuption. so why a resisted stun is not a slow with spell interuption (same for mez and root) ?<br />
<br />
<br />
So all in all, I think that currently EQ is not working well. That it comes from class parity/difference that is called balance. I think that currently the only way to fix it is with gear and AA tuning, but that this method can't provide a durable and wide solution because it will increase further the disparity between casual and hardcore gamers that will lead to a new issue that can be called 'gamers balance'. Personnally, I think that all gamers (from the most casual to the most intense) play this game because they like it. And thus, expect equal satisfaction (not equal character) from it, afterall they all pay the same amount to SoE (not counting stormhammer).<br />
Thus I think the more respectfull way to patch this issue is through a new melee and spell system, and when I admire their new graphic engine,  I think they can handle it without too much troubleshouts, acording they don't get pressure like &quot;you have to ship a new expension the 24th jully, like it or not, finished or not.&quot; or &quot;do something or I quit&quot; or &quot;new MMO with more advandced feetures are comming out, do something within two month or...&quot;).<br />

<br />
Kalanu here. I'd like to find out what issues are most important to you as far as armor, equipment and weapons go. What do we need with respect to issues with gear?<br />
<br />
For one, I know that itemization is an issue. We should have more Warrior only equipment available that helps us maintain our HP/AC advantage. <br />
<br />
What else do you feel we need?<br />
<br />
How would you fix it?<br />
<br />
Thanks!!!<br />
<br />
that sounds about right, but It needs to be widely avaible to those who have to power to kill whatever has it, we dont need another ornate set that people fight over, sell for profit, and backstab eachother over.<br />
<br />
Very avaible to those that can kill the required monster, or no drop and uncommon please<br />
<br />
*Cultural armor for warriors can be a bit lacking if you are agnostic or non- Rallos Zek.*<br />
<br />
AMEN TO THAT!<br />
<br />
I get very pissed when I see a RZ follower in RZ fierce heraldic gear with more hp than me at level 60, I have just recently broken past them and 5k unbuffed and i honestly think the playing field needs to be a bit more level among fellow warriors, as it doesnt hurt any RZ follows to allow everyone else to be brought up to scratch, vah shir and half elfs dont have any culteral or god armor just about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
offtopic but, warriors are ment to be better tanks, period.<br />

brenlo said so himself, he didnt say offtank or raid tank or group tank, he said we will always be better able to tank than knights. learn to live with it.</div></div><hr />

It's critical for SoE to realize there is no longer just one game. The concerns of casual players, those just entering PoTime, those farming Q'Vic, and those at the cutting edge can be wildly different.<br />
<br />
The last thing that I'd care about is RZ armor or the fact Karana Halflings can't make diety armor for a Halfling Karana Ranger. Yet some do care about such issues.<br />
<br />
One concern not posted here is the dead content phenomena. Half of Norrath is empty with only the ocassional twink getting PL'd. I don't even see players leveling twinks to 52 to take down Vox and Naggy and enjoy some of the older content. This doesn't look like a game that's growing. It looks like a top-heavy game where everyone is 65 and they have 1 goal - to be uber.<br />

Casters and hybrids get new spells every expansion, well if you want to sell that expansion to me, let's talk about the new toys Huzy gets. :)<br />
<br />
Would also like to see LDoN armor designed around the warrior.  Royal Attendant is  what I call &quot;Hybrid&quot; armor.  It has great strength and stamina modifiers, has both Wisdom and Intelligence in copious amounts, does some agility, but has absolutely NO dexterity.  I would love to have a second set that trades in that wis and int for lots of dexterity and agility.<br />
<br />
Now past expansions have always included armor built around warriors. PoP has armor built around  warriors. So my message to the Dev's is really &quot;stay the course&quot; and don't forget about us. Gear is what makes us, so when it isn't in an expansion we notice.</div></div><hr />

I see every class getting something that isnt link to an item every expantion, but for me, every ability is on my gear; in otherwords i am my armor, and a handful of AAs and that is it.... how about some new abilitys that are linked to the class, instead of some head slot item or weapon?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
As I said, they can't do it as easily as spells. our disc list is limited in essence.<br />
sure they can give us 'Superior Healling Will' to get 10kHP in one minute of rest ('make fragile' part).<br />
<br />
in otherwords i am my armor, and a handful of AAs and that is it.... <br />
<br />
once again, I agreed above. And they can't change that so stop regretting the old world time four years ago because they can't resurect it (even at only 50% exp :) ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">07-05-2004, 06:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right now, there are 4 types of disciplines: offensive, defensive, melee immunity and other. Any added pure disciplines have to compare to these, and will often serve the exact same function (that is, fellstrike and aggressive both increase DPS and nothing else). If they did some mixing and matching, with each portion less than the &quot;parent&quot; discipline, they could easily come up with useful added disciplines that are unique.<br />
<br />
  For example, they could add combination disciplines. Making up some numbers on the spot, say increase accuracy and evasion both by 20%. Or increase aggro 10% and increase mitigation 20%. Or increase resistances, resist fear and increase regen by say 100. Or increase evasion by 20% and mitigation by 20%. Or increase mitigation by 15% for 15 minutes at a lowish endurance cost. Or decrease damage 20%, increase endurance regen by 10 and hp regen by 50.<br />
<br />
 There is room for growth and usefulness, all it takes is some creativity. Make disciplines that are situationally useful, with varying durations and refresh timers. Allow us to use some tactics to consider which discipline to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">07-05-2004, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that disciplines are something they can look at and tune for OOW. Fact is that they went through the effort to give us endurance, so its not unreasonable to ask that we be given the choice to do something meaningful with that endurance.<br />
<br />
Delinking timers was one step, perhaps the next would be to take off the reuse time on some of the offensive discs.  This would then allows us more freedom in burning up endurance. If there are any concernts about this, then this can be balanced by increasing endurance cost or perhaps having a much shorter reuse time.<br />
<br />
Theother alternative would be more discs. Perhaps a long duration increased attack disc, overhaste disc on the offensive side, and on the defensive side perhaps a disc equivlanet to something like Bulwark of Vie., although i can imagine they will be very reluctant to allow further mitigation on warriors.</div></div><hr />

They won't mixt disc from different timer because it would remove the very basic idee of disc (&quot;choose which  branch, not branches, of your role do you want to improove temporarly). <br />
Neither they will remove reuse time cause hybrids would yeal for our &quot;spell like&quot; system that remove balance. Same for the 'little def for a long time', this would increase our exp group power (and our trash/add tank power) and thus make knights yeal. And I not convince that the 'half eva half def' disc will give an parsable improovement of our tankability.<br />
Thus you just end up with more utility disc (more regen of all sort and conbinaison, more resists of all sort and combinaison, ...).<br />
<br />
Thus we end up again with my statement (from my second post).</div></div><hr />

Missed that you were asking specifically about gear - the What Issues are Important to You title misled me completely.<br />
<br />
Look at Vadd's armor. You see any need for improvement? I suppose more aggro weapon alternatives at the high end or much much less reliance on aggro procs would be nice. A few more DS items, since if you missed them in earlier expansions you are big-time out of luck. Oh, and Improved Beer Goggles II - they should summon a six-pack.<br />

<br />
For example, if they buff up with vie, they can still use their spells while they mitigate, if your using defensive, you can not use incite.... discplines IMHO are basically self buffs that have more restrictions</div></div><hr />

How true this is.  Reading some of the posts by Frodlin and other cutting-edge players reminds me of a story I once read about Jack Nicklaus &amp; Tiger Woods ...

Very true.  <br />
<br />
Has any thought been given to the Vox/Naggy-ing of content when OoW comes out?  Its bad enough now if you're an up and coming guild.  You have to deal with Time or there abouts guilds coming back to farm your main content.  For example, on Xev don't think anyone ever gets to kill Tormax except for a single group of Blood Cult, (aka Bottomfeeder Cult).  What happens now when, say, Emperor of Ssra is doable by two groups of OoW high end guild types?  How will younger guilds actually get started?  Will they have to be born at the PoP level? <br />
<br />
How will SoE prevent bottomfeeding arseholes?  Or do they even care? Once you get a certain flag, you can't aggro in certain zones?  Do some of these older zones become instanced? (Instanced VT! Instanced VT! Instanced VT! hehe)  <br />
<br />
Not really a warrior thing.  But a concern I suppose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I realize this is going to be a fairly narrow scope, but one thing I would like to see is decreased mob spawn periods on older content (should help alleviate some of the concern of the above poster):<br />
<br />
- ToV Names<br />
- Tormax/Yelinak/AoW<br />
- Ssra<br />
- VT<br />
<br />
All these are on 7 day timers for the most part and represent some of the earliest opportunities to obtain aggro weaponry such as Blades of Carnage, Hategivers, Bloodfrenzies, which does limit some players access, especially when coupled with the obscene drop rates (on the above my guild went about 3 for 50 on EB weapon droppers /rude deep loot tables and the RNG). These mobs also represent some decent tanking gear for guilds/groups that do wish to pursue them, however even Luclin era mobs seemed to be heavily camped due to the longer spawn timers.<br />
<br />
Tradeskilled armours, I think need to be looked at, but also with an eye on drops and what is available through the elemental planes (increase the components and the gear will become more available to everyone: it is a step up from Velious/ornate equivalent and non-deity specific).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lathen</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For gear issues:<br />
I endorse Wulfran's thoughts on increasing spawn times in older content. That will, indeed, help matters. <br />
<br />
I also think the tradeskilled armors should be reworked so that the items you create could have more class-specific use. For warriors, for example, we need stamina and hit points first and foremost. Why couldn't a skilled smith discover a special temper that added stamina to a piece of armor? The mechanics of this would be that you have a generic set of instructions for making the armor, then add the customizing elements you want to make a piece of class-specific equipment. They came close to this with the LDoN armors . What I'm talking about is adding a level of choice to that process.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Played a war since -99 and one thing i always lacked was any ability besides proc's to move a mob. Well beside the summon / backup solution (mobs summon once and then the refresh timer makes them follow you if you back up again instead of resummon).<br />
<br />
Anyway , what i want is a skill to throw myself at the mob and push him backwards. Not doing any damage or interrupting spells or anything , just move/push my target back a few feet.<br />
Monks got dragonpunch and warriors are up in the face of the mob duking it out so why shouldn't we be able to at least have a small impact on where the mob is since we are already in his face slashing/slamming/bashing and whatnot.<br />
Since disarm is absolutely useless i much rather replace that ability with a ability to affect my mobs placement somewhat.<br />
<br />
And in my opinion its not overpowering nor unbalancing , just very useful in many situations and should be very easy to introduce since the code is already ingame.</div></div><hr />

While I see the usefullness of these abilities, personally, I'd rather not add warrior utility.  I play a warrior to tank, nothing more, nothing less.  Adding utility to warriors would require adding tanking or more utility to knights to keep the classes balanced.  This would result in a further merging of knights and warriors.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went over the Warrior Class Issues List over on SoE's Warriors board and was kinda disappointed. A couple of things stuck out a lot:<br />
<br />
Kick/Slam - there're two issues and it doesn't seem like SoE understands: Damage and the ability to stun (chiefly to try to interrupt gaters).<br />
<br />
Shields - even if shields were made more useful to Tanks by for example giving them a chance to block, Warriors do not generally have the kind of quality DPS 1 handers available to Knights and by going from DW to 1H + shield aggro procs are reduced. Since a Warrior might well want to equip a shield when tanking, this aggro reduction is a concern.<br />
<br />
Crits/Cripples - didn't make the list. Crit damage, particularly a minimum Crit, is not very high. With as hard as mobs hit now going Beserk and hitting Mightystrike is pretty useless - a Warriors is either going to die almost immediately or get healed which means of course those intended Cripples become mediocre Crit spam.<br />
<br />
Groupability - didn't make the list. Not long ago SoE announced that the Phase 2 Melee Update was not going to happen. This update was intended to improve the groupability of Warriors and to make palying a Warrior more interesting. Warrior groupability issues still exist. In brief, the other two Plate tanks bring various abilities into groups including buffs, heals, Root, stun , GRC, etc. or the ability to FD pull, &quot;snare&quot;, use a pet, and to do damage in a variety of ways. Warrior capabilites may include greater survivability and little else. Should Knights get &quot;burst mitigation&quot; or should most experiance camps never require a Warrior's greater mitigation, then Warriors have little to recommend them to groups compared to other Plate tank classes.<br />

EDIT:<br />
<br />
Also something that is VERY IMPORTANT, warrior drops STOP SHAFTING warriors, I am sick of every good warrior drop being stupidly rare. Spells are real common, weapons for DPS classes are common, the important drops for every class = common.<br />
<br />
Why shaft warriors?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tachyr</div><div class="date">07-10-2004, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Battleblade , the concern regarding shields would be easily fixed by doing either of 2 things.<br />
<br />
1. Add a chance to proc while using a shield (bash) and add another aug slot type 4 or 8 to allow regular proc augmentations. Then i could live with the dps drop , at least i would soak up damage better and still keep aggro.<br />
<br />
2. Introduce 1 handers that can only be used with a shield (far fetched and unlikely).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Add an AA ability that allows 2-handers to be equiped one-handed in conjuction with a shield, at a cost of one-fourth (or maybe one-thrid) of the 2H stats.  So a Vanazir would become AC 40(30) - DMG 60(45) - DLY 38 - HP  230(171) etc. while equiped with a shield. Keep the 2H damage bonus.  2H AA's would still apply.  This should put the 2H/shield combo 3rd in dps behind straight 2H and dual wielding, but ahead of both on stats/surviveability.  This would probably mean that a few new warrior only 2-handers would need to be introduced at select stages of the game, since a 3/4 Vanazir is probably a bit worse than a DBoW.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">07-10-2004, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As one of the people who frequent these boards that is *not* Time, EP or even PonB flagged, I just want to make sure that you keep our interests in mind as well. To me, some of those would include:<br />
<br />
--Increased Weapon Selection. Off of my head I can come up with less than a dozen weapons that have any sort of proc usefull for aggro holding. I am one of the fortunate few to be able to afford something better than a Copper Hammer of Striking/Sword of the Bloodsworn combo due to having a 65 main and having played so long. But when a good 2/3rds of the warriors on a server are using the same weapon setup, I think something needs to be changed. Either remove the need for proc spams to keep aggro on higher-up mobs or decrease the aggro generated from other classes, casters in particular, and crit-dots even more in particular.<br />
<br />
--Lack of dependance on deity. True, a warrior will function just fine if he is agnostic or worships someone that isn't the Tribunal or Rallos Zek, but they are certainly at an advantage, and quite a large one at that. A few people touched on better armor that was non-deity, I am basically just saying that that is a good idea.<br />
<br />
--Access to more lower-tier raids. Someone mentioned redoing the 7-day spawn timer that was prevelant throughout Velious and parts of Luclin, I support that very much. <br />
<br />
--Higher selection of items, not more of a certain item. To me, it's sad that there is such a small selection of items for a particular slot. Not only does this make it difficult to sell an item sometimes, it also leads to the price being driven into the ground. The fact that I can buy a Greatstaff of Thunder for 50pp right now is very, very sad. <br />
<br />
Perhaps it would be a good idea to re-evaluate the No Drop tag on such a large amount of items. As the content expands, items from older expansions should become droppable, in my opinion. Not all of course, but some. Items like a Windspeeder, Claw of Lightning etc. would fit in well with todays market, and would perhaps increase incentive to go to those zones again. <br />
<br />
These are obviously not all warrior-specific concerns, but with the degree that our gear defines our character, I believe that the people who don't have the time or the want to do heavy duty raidin g should have a chance to get really good items aside from a Loyalists Shield of Honor. Perhaps we could get more indepth quests that yield items more around the 125-150hp area, but that take time/tradeskills/smaller raids to do...ALA Velious and all of the quests from Thurg.<br />
<br />
Just my opinions on such is all. Have a nice day.</div></div><hr />
