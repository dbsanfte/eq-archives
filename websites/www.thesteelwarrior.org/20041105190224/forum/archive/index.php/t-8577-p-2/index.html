<br />
So your saying Monks should be able to tank lower content? How low? Kunark? Luclin? Planes? Guess what, we can't? we need a fix.<br />
<br />
you seem to keep forgetting or ignoring that more hp means better mana ratio for CHeal and more taunt means beter agro control, we don't have these, if we had the same or even just a little below your mitigation we would not be a more viable tank for these two reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&quot;just what I saw you monks say on your board about 15times... &quot;<br />
<br />
You don't believe a word those monks say. And argue with them about every little detail. Across 3 to 4 separate threads. What makes this subject any different?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What if it's magic silk? Made from magic silkworms from a totally different plane of existence? And dyed red from Jack's Magic Beans, pre-beanstalk?<br />
What if the magic binding together it's threads is so strong it can turn back blades and repel the fiery breath of dragons?<br />
<br />
What then?<br />
<br />
What if that magic breastplate a knight pried out of that dead boss' treasure chest is smithed with such powerful magic, it's lighter than a feather, allows them complete freedom of movement, and doesn't rust when they swim?<br />
<br />
What if ... an entire WORLD was run by magic, and its most powerful treasures, powered and fueled by ancient magical enchantments, were so strong, they broke the laws of science and flouted convention?<br />
<br />
What if, those pants bestowed on that monk by the very avatar of the god of war himself, while being a bit icky (and slightly itchy) due to being crafted from the removed flesh of devout war-worshipping barbarians, was tailored and cured together by such powerful magic from the war-god himself ... that they protected like they were made from plates?<br />
<br />
Call me whacky. I guess somewhere along the line, I fell for the whole &quot;idea&quot; that I was a playing a fantasy based role playing game where magic items were &quot;treasure.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
What if your magic leather doohickie still isnt as solid as my magic plate doohickie.  Seriously ... unless your shit is magic and mine aint ... then my shit is gonna be better than your shit for absorbing damage.  So basically ... armor of the same level of gameplay should always run plate &gt; chain &gt; leather &gt; silk.  The only exceptions should be if armor comes from different difficulty levels ... and this is already made up for due to focus, ac, hps etc ... you know ... stat differences.<br />
<br />
You're digging ... but you aren't finding anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">&quot;What if your magic leather doohickie still isnt as solid as my magic plate doohickie. &quot;<br />
<br />
Then the item is going to demonstrate that.<br />
<br />
Your magic plate doohickie is going to have 90 AC and 225 hit points. My magic leather doohickie is going to have 60 AC and 175 hit points. Your magic plate is stronger than my magic leather.<br />
<br />
See how nice and neat that works out?<br />
<br />
My magic leather doohickie, though, is still stronger than any magic plate doohickies warriors are still wearing from the last time they killed Derakor the Vindicator. And it should be.  Because to get the magic leather doohickie, I had to kill stronger mobs with stronger magic than Derakor.<br />
<br />
But if I have an 90 AC leather magic doohickie, it's magic is strong enough to protect just as well as a 90 AC plate magic doohickie.<br />
<br />
Because magic is magic is magic. If you have a problem with magic being overpowered and unbalanced like this ... take that complaint to Merlin. Or some fairy looking elf chick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The only way to really figure out which magic item is stronger is to go by the stats on those very magic items.<br />
<br />
No, that's not strictly true.  It's the combination of the stats on the item and the innate abilities of the class wearing it.  Naked a Monk is going to take a hell of a lot less damage than a Warrior.  Once geared up, the Warrior will take less then the Monk.  Giving Monks 60 AC silk robes would basically mean that Monks are protected just like a Warrior and still avoid much more damage.  Imbalance, ever hear of the word?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&quot;Giving Monks 60 AC silk robes would basically mean that Monks are protected just like a Warrior and still avoid much more damage. Imbalance, ever hear of the word?&quot;<br />
<br />
Glatius ... Apollyon is currently wearing a 63 AC chest item. I am currently wearing a 28 AC chest item.<br />
<br />
There's no imbalance. The items govern themselves. My 28 AC leather chest item should protect like a 28 AC item of ANY material. Because the material is magic.<br />
<br />
An AC 63 silk robe a monk happens to wear, should protect as good as Kizrak's breastplate that Apollyon is wearing. Because when that monk gets the AC 63 robe it's coming from content where Apollyon will obviously have access to a much higher AC item.<br />
<br />
The material the item is made out of is irrelevant. It's magical material, protected and empowered by magic enchantments. It's a freakin Magic Item. Like a sword of sharpness +2 from your very first D&amp;D campaign. It doesn't play by the rules of the real world. And never has.<br />
<br />
Go by the stats on the item. The rest of the stuff is made null and void by the &quot;fantasy&quot; aspect of your fantasy online role playing game's setting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then you are absolutely right ... it's a shame that warriors are still better innately at mitigating incoming dmg.  So while your bp may be as strong, your skill with it and it's realized potential is still much lower.<br />
<br />
So ... in order for you to take dmg better than a warrior, your gear must be sufficient to overcome both the innate ac/stat differences and the warrior in questions skill. Your 90ac may make you tank like a 45ac bp warrior, but your 90ac bp wont let you touch a 90ac war.<br />
<br />
You aren't a tank.  You won't ever tank like a tank.  Believe it or not, itemization does not mediate everything in this game.  For that, i am thankful, or else you'd see time wizards/druids/clerics playing tank for everything other than cutting edge raid content.<br />
<br />
I see this one hitting 30+ pages.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
If this is the case then they will be re-thinking ac values on practically everything.<br />
<br />
Read my above post.  28ac leather protects like 28ac plate ... but warriors will get more for their ac than you mr monk.  It's a perk of the class just like your monkly avoidance, so get over it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess if you guys are in such love with mitigation...<br />

I would expect you would support your avoidance abilities taking a significant nerf while your mitigation abilities got raised?<br />
<br />
This way you mitigate like a druid, and mitigation is what you want anyway... the price you pay is that you avoid only a little better than the other classes.<br />
<br />
I'm somehow doubting that would be supported, I'm really thinking monks want to have their cake in eat it too in a significant avoidance advantage plus mitiqation equality, thereby tanking just as well as the traditional tanks.</div></div><hr />

Agreed, there have been numerous proposals supported by most of the warriors here to solve the infamous &quot;pulling&quot; problem. But the monks want nothing to do with them. Funny that and funny that it leads us to believe that they want more than they say ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&quot;it's a shame that warriors are still better innately at mitigating incoming dmg.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is a completely separate debate. I can see how it's easy to mix them up. But, thank you at least for conceeding I was right about magic. And how magic makes the leather/plate/silk &quot;argument&quot; completely silly. Because it does. I wasn't saying anything outrageous or controversial. I was merely saying that magical silk in a magical fantasy world certainly can turn a blade away as easily as magical plate.<br />
<br />
Everything else is a separate part of the debate.<br />
<br />
Just realize that everytime one of these silly debates pops up, it takes some very typical turns. One of those turns is &quot;but you wear leather and I wear metal plates!&quot;<br />
<br />
In regards to that one aspect of the debate ... it's complete nonsense. We're both wearing magical items from the most dangerous foes in the magic run world. The comparison simply doesn't work.<br />
<br />
It's why, on the other end of the debate, when non-plate wearers shoot back, &quot;Well why don't you sink?&quot; ... that too is also complete nonsense.<br />
<br />
Those magical plates you wear are magic. And don't follow the rules of real world plates. You don't see me asking for you all to sink and to have horrible movement rate because you're running around in tin cans? No. Because, like I said ... it's ALL magic. None of that &quot;real world&quot; logic applies. Not when you spend your time fighting dragons and giants.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, and many of them have either been passed on through our coorespondant, or sent up through other means.   Know what comes of it?  Pretty much nothing.<br />
<br />
We've been begging for ANY type of response as to what SoE thinks we should be for over 2 years.<br />
<br />
One of the suggestions I've seen here is something we suggested quite a while ago.  And instead it being given as a 'fix' to our problem, we get it in the form of a OoW AA.  Just more to keep us on the AA treadmill so SoE gets more of our money.<br />
<br />
But of course all the 'fixes' that are being suggested also ALL hinge on the paranoia that we all have our hidden agenda and actually just want to tank again, so none of them will entertain ANY consideration of us mitigating like a melee class again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dobbanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Let me get this straight, your proposal, what you think is a reasonable compromise for someone elses class, is to take their avoidance, which is already minimal of an advantage over warriors and other plate tanks, and reduce it farther so we can mitigate like a druid? And you think THATS balanced? On behalf of monks everywhere I would just like to say, bite me. That isnt balanced, not even close. You know it, thats the reason you suggested it. Monks know it, thats the reason we ignored it. Total rubbish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">See, that's what I figured.<br />
<br />
That &quot;minimal&quot; advantage that you would have people believe is ALREADY sufficient enough, as shown by Thepp's parses, so that the ONLY class that takes less average melee damage than monks, is a warrior alone. Monks take less average damage than even shadowknights and paladins due to their &quot;minimal&quot; avoidance advantage, and you want a mitigation bonus on top of it? You take MORE damage per hit than a druid, but due to this &quot;minimal&quot; avoidance advantage, you take TWO THIRDS of the average damage of a druid!<br />
<br />
Rubbish.<br />
<br />
The ONLY way you can get any kind of significant mitigation increase as you would like, is to balance it by reducing your avoidance. Otherwise balance flies right out the window.<br />
<br />
I somehow am guessing balance is not something some monks are terribly concerned with.<br />
<br />
7-8% less of a hit rate over a warrior is a &quot;minimal&quot; advantage. /snort, give me a break.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrong, balance is what we want, balance is what was taken away from us. (I hereby pause so all warriors reading this can roll their eyes and say oh not again!)<br />
<br />
<br />
Our avoidance is already high, thats why most of us feel that we would benefit more from mitigation, which is the exact opposite of warriors, who feel their mitigation is sufficient enough to consider concentrateing on avoidance instead. First off why mitigation is better for pulling, (yet again) we can only dodge from behind, thats the only avoidance skill beyond pure misses (which warriors get more of incidentally) which factors into damage taking that way. So, unless we either get pure misses upgraded by a significant amount, which would throw game balance out of whack when we are facing the mob, or boost dodge by 150 points to make it fire more frequently, avoidance wont do jack squat for us on pulling, more mitigation, (specifically, the % that was taken from all monks) WOULD actually make a difference and would be much simpler to code.<br />
<br />
As for balance, our mitigation and avoidance was fine and dandy while the gear seperated us from plate tanks, it was great for a number of years in fact. Now, can anyone tell me what changed? Thats right Timmy, verant pulled a boner and put stupid amounts of ac on monk useable gear, thus upsetting the BALANCE that existed beforehand. Now, that gear imbalance has corrected itself from PoP on up. Monk gear once again has far less hp/ac than plate classes get thus restablishing the old balance. Or at least it WOULD, if we didnt also have an additional penalty on us just for being monks that compounds our naturally lower mitigation than plate classes. To say nothing of the softcap which would appear to be more of a hard cap, its not very soft when 500 ac = 1% mitigation improvement, but lets not argue over word choice here. <br />
<br />
Balance? Thats what we are after here, to be balanced with the rest of the game. Now, about that ridiculous parse. Think about it realistically here. We avoid more than you, of COURSE the longer the parse is, the more damage we will avoid and eventually, if you continue it for long enough, the monk will be taking FAR less total damage than the warrior would. Does that mean monks are secretly superior tanks? No! It means that if we get swung at a million times, and YOI get swung at a million times and I get missed 4 times out of 10 while you only get missed 3 times out of 10, Ill take less damage eventually. How long does a normal exp group kill take? 30 seconds? Do you REALLY think the monks oh so superior avoidance will manifest itself often enough to make it worth taking a character that has less hp, gets hit harder even if our ac counted for exactly what a knights ac meant since our ac is lower, and cant reliably take and hold agro? Please.</div></div><hr />

<br />
in a short term parse you'll either see a huge gap between one who avoids and one who mitigates, or a large gap the other way.<br />
<br />
Mitigation shows it's true form in long runs actually, not short encounters like say pulling....</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No you flaming pile of cow flop, NOONE got one rounded back then! Unless you were pulling the aow or something equally evil NOTHING did enough damage to kill you in a single round! This was back in the days when in an exp group the casters could afford to stand there and take hits for a few rounds while warriors desperately mashed taunt and any other tanking type did their damndest to pull it off the cleric/wizard/shaman/whatever. All that without getting healed unless it went on too long. My DRUID was soloing dark blues to death through melee in the days of kunark. (Well, melee and my damage shields lol)  <br />
<br />
As for short parses, no, you will see variations on the part of the warriors/knights but most of that will be due to their avoidance streaks.  How often they parried, dodged, or riposted that fight is what will cause most of the variations, sure not ALL of it, but the vast majority of the difference. I bet the average HIT will be pretty similar throughout the parses for both, much lower for the warrior, as it should be, and hammer time for the monk, as it shouldnt be. There is no way in hell you can sit there and claim that any caster class should be able to mitigate better than a pure melee. It doesnt matter if we avoid more, we are a melee class, we should be mitigating far better than some stinking caster class can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Look we can argue over what mitigation and avoidance means. Or whether a bulletproof vest pretects better than magical fantasy breatplates. however, breifly, for a moment there we were actually discussing some viable improvments for monks. Can we get  over the initial posts in this thread an continue with a more reasonable discussion, or should we continue argueing points that have been agrued a hundred times before.<br />
<br />
1. The auto-attack off mitigation/avoidance bonus idea - This is good, clickys aren't going to hold agro against anything worth fighting.<br />
<br />
2. Returning normal mitigation to monks /w negative agro adjustment - Its a tossup. Monks already have the ability to shead agro at will anyways, however this does remove the need FD and takes some of the risk out of attacking a mob. Doesn't allow monks to tank trival content, I think this is a bad idea.<br />
<br />
3. Low cost short reuse mitigation/avoidance disc for pulling /w negative agro - Decent idea.<br />
<br />
4. 360' densive skills - I think one thing that hasn't been mention in a god manner is that druid quite possible do take less damage than monks while pulling. Most all defensive skills monks have do not work from behind, except for the minor improvement from the AA. Its quite possible that the druid will take less damage because monk mitigation is so bad, and avoidance isn't working from behind. This could fix that. Bad part is fighting monk mobs who would likely also have these abilities.<br />
<br />
These all attack the issues at hand, lets continue this discussion. I really think we were getting somewhere for a second there.<br />
<br />
I'd like to reiterate that I think improveing monk pulling or returning it to its pre -&quot;the vision&quot; nerf status won't hurt anyones feelings. Monks have nothing to offer groups except DPS and pulling. Improving these would do wonders for the monk class. Fixing caster mobs vs FD and upping monk DPS get my vote so far. The wat FD is working right now with casters is just stupid and given the level of utility monks have with their frail hps, they really should be doing more DPS than they currently do.<br />
<br />
This is an opinion, but rogue, wizard, and monk DPS should all be at about the same level. Making monk be able to viably attack from any angle just as effectively as from behind with worrying about reposte and other defenses might make them more desireable and free up some of that crowed mobs backside.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dobbanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I will have to say, the idea of 360 degree FULL avoidance is the only thing that I would consider a possibility instead of just returning our mitigation.

Oh and btw, I apologise for letting myself get dragged back into this topics here.</div></div><hr />

Why because we don't know anything about pulling or because we don't know anything about what helps us survive various encounters, brief, long etc....<br />

Oh horror! No duh, of course if our mitigation is improved we will be better at tanking than we are now, noone is denying that, noone is claiming that our ability to take a hit better while pulling wont also increase our ability to take a hit while standing toe to toe. What we ARE denying is the insane belief that if monks recieve the level of mitigation they should have always kept, that suddenly every zone will become like revamped ct and warriors will be cast out of all groups. Or knights will. Its nonsense and anyone who has basic logic skills can realize it. Who do I want to tank in my group? The guy with over 2k ac and 10k hp fully buffed who I can depend on to hold agro off the casters? Or the other guy with less than 1800 ac, and less than 9k hp and has no dependable instant agro? Hmm, decisions decisions. Thats what it comes down to, no matter how much you try to twist it into something more sinister liper and frodlin, monks will remain inferior to plate tanks in all matters pertaining to tanking at all levels.</div></div><hr />

See, you guys are the ones who believe that you are being denied the level of mitigation you should have always kept.  We don't agree.  We don't think you're being &quot;kept down by the man&quot; like you seem to think.  We aren't interested in what you think on the topic because your position has been clear from long before the nerf went in.  Monks gloried in being quite capable tanks.  They relished their ability to tank when they wanted to.  They used to tell stories on MB all the time about how they'd take aggro without even really trying from the poor gimped Warrior and tank as well or better.  And they'd laugh about it.<br />
<br />
Could your mitigation use a very slight improvement?  Perhaps.  But you're not going to get enough of an improvement to really make a serious difference in today's game unless it's over the serious objections of Warriors, Shadow Knights, and Paladins.  Monks are not tanks.  Monks should not and will not mitigate like a tank anytime in the foreseeable future.  End of story.</div></div><hr />

Yep, and then we backed you on itemization fixes, your innate damage reduction, increase aggro abilities, etc... <br />

See my recollection is quite different from yours.  Yes, some Monks were supportive.  And some Monks had the attitude, SoE nerfed Monks, screw Warriors.   And even if some Monks were supportive, that doesn't mean we're obligated to support you in getting something that could very possibly put our place in the game in peril.  You keep saying you've tossed out all these other ideas and gotten no feedback from SoE, yet you've gotten NEGATIVE feedback from SoE on a mitigation increase more than once and you still keep going back to it.  Why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Dobbanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Yeah im so sorry that monks were able to take agro at will from warriors because taunt sucked and besides that, you had no real option for gaining agro. You remember those times right? When monks had faster, better weapons than warriors and so were able to build up much larger chunks of agro off sheer dps? So, what? You think because monks were ABLE to tank back then when warrior taunt sucked and you were being replaced by knights far more often than monks because both were able to maintain higher agro than you, that we shouldnt be fixed now? <br />
<br />
You see, what YOU think our class needs doesnt count, you arent a monk, a number of you have even come up with glaring inaccuracies about what our class can and cant do, you are still jumping at shadows afraid of bringing back the days when warriors admittedly sucked hardcore at everything but raid level encounters. You are unwilling or unable to realize that times have changed drastically since then and short of giving us the same ac totals as warriors with mitigation to match, we wont be replacing you OR knights as exp tanks. You havent managed to come up with one REAL reason why monks will be better tanks besides the stupid over 2 hours our damage avoided makes up for our damage taken angle. Like only average damage per swing matters and damage per hit doesnt count for anything. Continue to twist all the facts you want, its your board after all, you are free to make up whatever stories your heart desires. But we all know the truth, warriors are just so frightened of losing even the slightest bit of their advantage over every other class that you will mindlessly lash out and oppose anything that might bring it about. Oh and by losing an advantage, I am reffering to losing some of it, ie, monks will become better at taking hits but still far inferior to any plate wearer as it should be.</div></div><hr />

Despite the fact that I don't want mitigation becasue I don't think it will help monks very much, overall the monk class is definitely hurting right now.  It's actually very similar to the warriors situation last year.  Our greatest ability (pulling, for warriors it was tanking) is an ability that several other classes can do just as well or better in all but the most difficult situations, and although we can play the dps card (like warriors could over knights) the dps isn't nearly good enough.  Much like warriors (although in a different way) very high end gear could mostly counter the problem, but the other 98% have it bad.</div></div><hr />

No monks want to out tank warriors, not the smart ones anyway. Guess what would happen if we did tank better than you guys? They'd probably nerf our mitigatoin just like they did 2 years ago. Why would we ask for something that would only be taken away?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with this but its not the fault of warriors or mitigation. Its the fact that nothing has been done to enhance the pulling role while bards have been taken to the sky.<br />
<br />
You argue that several other classes are now better pullers. I would ask which (other than bards) you think those are? Yes several classes, that have pulled in the past or do now, tank better than you (sk/pally) but the reality is monks are broken principally in GoD where pulling sucks for all other than maybe bards.<br />
<br />
And yes all would agree that melee dps (not just monks) needs to be looked at and tweaked. No one here has suggested anything else.<br />
<br />
In the end what you are basically arguing is that mitigation in GoD rules over all and that is true, but its true for all the melee based dps classes. And yes it hurts monks more than most. Given that monks specialization is avoidance why arent you guys arguing for yet more of that. It would help you but it wouldnt make you a better tank necessarily because of the potential for streakiness that would still exist relative to the plate classes. You could be arguing for a 50% back stun resist AA or the increase of your innate back avoidance, but no it HAS to be mitigation. And as a result you will likely get no support from the 3 classes (just like shammies and pallys cant get better healing easily cause of druids and clerics) that are most impacted. Go figure.<br />

There is a trick that necromancers and shadowknights can use, involving their pets, that results in clean, single pulls everytime. The pet in question is fragile. So it sometimes can't work.<br />
<br />
But monks are fragile too. And sometimes don't work.<br />
<br />
I can understand if you're not familiar with this tactic. It's something a bit more noticed by people who pull. Anyways, that's just one of the things out there affecting pullers. There are other problems too. And not really all that much of a concern to a community of tanks, imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Scal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">The trick is quite nice but unless the pet gets BDA'd, it has a small success rate of actually living through a mob that hits harder than 700.  Granted you can get lucky with casters nuking the pet and such, this trick doesn't work too well once you reach the E-planes, and in Gates....  I'm pretty sure no pullers are having problems pulling in non-Gates zones.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Gargen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">The real key to the point I was trying to make is that in most exp groups any pacify class can pull fine so you don't need a monk to do it.  Heck, if you have good CC, the tank is probably the best puller regardless of what class they are.  I pull in most groups I get, but it's usually just because &quot;I'm  monk and monks pull&quot; rather than because we actualy need a pulling specialist.<br />
<br />
When it comes to the tricky stuff, it's all bards and monks with some occasional jobs for the SKs/Necros, the tricky stuff isn't all that common any more.<br />
<br />
<br />
So we agree monks are broken, but disagree on how to fix them*.  I can live with that.<br />

<br />
But you see we do care about pulling.  We care that for the most part we can't do it for crap.  Monks pull head and shoulders better than Warriors, even though Monks mitigate far for worse and Warriors have the best mitigation in the game.  Most situations you talk about being hard for a Monk to successfully pull would usually mean a multi-pull if a Warrior was doing it and more times than not death for the Warrior.<br />
<br />
So when Monks start talking about needing more mitigation to &quot;survive&quot; pulls, Warriors instinctively say bullshit.  Mitigation isn't what makes Monks great pullers.  Warriors have great mitigation and are some of the worst pullers in the game.  Ergo having great mitigation isn't what makes a class a great puller.  So it's very hard to reconcile this ongoing demand on the part of Monks to have their old mitigation returned to them because all they want it for is to pull.   That's not all they did with it before when they had it, it's hard to believe that's all they'd restrict themselves to if it was returned.  <br />
<br />
We don't believe it when Monks tell us that all they'd do with mitigation similar to a Warrior's is pull with it.  It does not compute.  It's not all it's good for and therefore is impossible to believe that the players of Monks would intentionally cripple themselves in what they can do if it was returned to them.</div></div><hr />

FYI we have an aa that allows us to stay feigned when hit by a spell already. Also, I have never actually used it but isnt our lull landing on ANYTHING that isnt totally immune to pacify type spells?

I dont think the pulling debate would be as bad if monks had better dps. Exp grp = dps and pull ability, raids = pull, thats how I look at a monk. I know you can pull with pac (got cleric, chanter, and paladin all 65 250+AA), etc. but I really believe the biggest problem for monks in pulling is likely the bard taking the role in the tougher zones. IMHO bards are probably the least balanced class, may be cause our guild only has one and I want more. And I will freely admit my monk knowledge is limited relative to a guy living a monk every day. I only use mine to pull hard LDoN and GoD in my 6box ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Magruda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Exactly how do you know what belongs in the monk class? Nobody has even commented as to which tank they would pick A or B. it will always be A.<br />
<br />
And what improvements are you talking about? AA points? So Monks can't be balanced until they reach 50? and then they have to grind exp for AA points while everyone else is lvling up so they can be balanced?<br />
<br />
I know that you were hurting back when they nerfed us, i'm sorry, but even after they nerfed us you guys still had problems. Being angry at us for that is not a solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">You misunderstand.  We're not angry with Monks.  We just see no justification for upping their mitigation significantly because it will have impacts to the class and the game beyond just &quot;pulling better&quot;.  And just because you SAY people would never pick a Monk over a Warrior to tank doesn't mean that's what would happen in reality.<br />
<br />
You haven't convinced anyone that Monks are so troubled as a class that the ONLY possible improvement is to return their old mitigation.  You have convinced me at least that a number of Monks are so focused on regaining their old mitigation they'll ignore most every other alternative.</div></div><hr />

<br />
was it druids? nope<br />
was it rangers? nope...<br />
oh that's right it was the none snap aggro monk....<br />
<br />
Apparently if a monk from start to finish can keep aggro on fennin ro, I have no doubts he's able to keep aggro in a exp group...</div></div><hr />

Include other classes too i want to see that.<br />
<br />
Here is the problem as i see it. I'm a 57 monk with 1090 ac. I may be undergeared? maybe i'm not. it's what i can afford or obtain. (i'm not a twink) i'm in PoN with a group. we move to hobogoblins, somehow the necro gets agro and ends up dead at the hobos feet. She consents me and i go to get her corpse, (perfecctly good job for a monk). I get a little agro and it hits me for one hit. of..... 344 points of damage and 250. I'm now at 65% hp. Tell me that a PURE melee class should take this kind of abuse.<br />
<br />
I take it back your not agry, your scared. This is what i tell my neice when she is scared. &quot;I'ts just a bug, it won't hurt you. Just let it be and go about your business.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah. No.<br />
<br />
It was because of his avoidance.<br />
<br />
Actually, to be more precise, it was because of both avoidance and mitigation, with avoidance being the far more important and greater of a difference between the two.<br />
<br />
You didn't see the ranger tanking, even though he's a chain class, and the only other tank. You didn't see the rogue tanking, even though he is a chain class as well, whereas the monk is only leather.<br />
<br />
No, you saw the monk tanking, EVEN over the ranger, who is considered a light tank, while a monk should not be a tank at all.<br />
<br />
And yet monks want even more mitigation, even when the situations descibed above happen.<br />
<br />
Yeah. Right. I can just hear rangers now....</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No. You're not.<br />
<br />
Tanks have taunt buttons. You don't have a taunt button, so you're not a tank. Your role revolves around pulling and DPS, NOT tanking. Rangers, the REAL 4th tank, all they HAVE is light tanking and DPS. Now you feel that a monk should be alight tank ON TOP of DPS and pulling? That's called greed. Not very many classes have two defined roles, let alone three which is what you would have us believe monks do/should have. Several classes only have ONE role.<br />
<br />
Even if you WERE a light tank, which you're not, you wouldn't be the 4th, you'd be the 5th. War/Pal/Shad/Ranger are the first 4.<br />
<br />
The more you post, the more you show what you're really after.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except that making you mitigate 4th best means you mitigate just as well as CHAIN classes... which are the next level UP from the armour that you wear. ON TOP of which you have an avoidance advantage, which means you would be BETTER than chain classes.<br />
<br />
In a word... overpowered.<br />
<br />
Secondly, <br />
<br />
 And yes, pre nerf we were considered light tanks.<br />
<br />
No. You weren't. Pre-nerf, you were overpowered enough with the good mitigation and superior avoidance that you tanked better than warriors. Overpowered... and nerfed.<br />
<br />
<br />
We always were. We are SUPPOSED to be.<br />
<br />
No. You're not. You listen well. Do you have a taunt key? No. Nuff said, you're not a tank, nor were you ever meant to be... because if you were, you'd have the Taunt skill. And again you show your true colors on the matter. What you want isn't balance, what you want isn't the ability to pull and not take a beating... what you want, is some level of your old overpoweredness back.<br />
<br />
The very fact that you want, and feel perfectly justified in getting, the ability to mitigate as well as those who wear THE NEXT LEVEL OF ARMOUR *BEYOND* YOURS, while still maintaining your avoidance advantage is proof enough of that. You would between your equal mitigation and superior avoidance tank better than any chain class including the light tank, and quite nearly approach the knight's level of tanking.<br />
<br />
You know what asking for that level of mitigation means? Let's plug that into Thepp's parses.<br />
<br />
War avg/round: 109.2<br />
Monk (with this &quot;fix&quot;) avg/round: 117.9<br />
Pal avg/round: 130.4<br />
Ranger: 141.7<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah. You'd tank better than knights in PLATE armour, and only be a little worse than a PURE TANK.<br />
<br />
That's beyond ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

I swear. Before the nerf it was exactly as you just descrebed. Do you know where the Leather classes, and the Plate classes, terms came from? Did you not read the post WAY before this one explaining this? Go back and read it please. Velous Thurgadin, Kael, and ToV. Armor was where those terms came from. and if you put an intire set of those armors on each of the classes the monk would mitigate better than the ranger. Don't belive me? go look it up. Before Velous there were NO plate/leather/cloth classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">&quot;I dont think the pulling debate would be as bad if monks had better dps. &quot;<br />
<br />
Believe it or not ... I agree. I may rant a bit. I may be very stubborn as pointed out much earlier in the thread. But I've not been lying. For me (and for some other monks) it's always been about improving what the class' perceived, or rather loosely defined, roles are. Pulling. DPS. That kind of stuff. If you notice, from me, the only real problems I have with the mitigation changes monks went through, all stemmed from pulling.<br />
<br />
DPS issues are another headache. And since ya brought it up ... I really don't think monks have much of a shot at convincing SOE to help us in that area at all. Maybe that's just me being overly cynical or negative. But I don't forsee much help in that area coming.<br />

That's the problem. You should be fighting it out tooth and nail between zerkers, rogues, beastlords, and yourselves for 5th, and be clearly below rangers.<br />

Instead as shown by Thepp's parses, you're SECOND, significantly above ALL of those as well as slightly better than knights, and that's WITHOUT the increase mitigation you're asking for.</div></div><hr />

Absor made those statements. The thing about that is ... at the TIME he wasn't a dev. He is currently. So technically what you said is correct. But it's misleading. At the time Absor was just a tool.

<br />
The thing that I don't really see mentioned though by monks is ...<br />
<br />
You already, with your mitigation how it currently is, take not much less damage than us.    You already take less damage than knights.<br />
<br />
If your mitigation is returned, then you WOULD take less damage than us (same mitigation, greater avoidance), like you did before.   Taking less damage than us is wrong, you shouldn't be doing it.  Furthermore, taking less damage than us, and a LOT less than knights is REALLY an issue.<br />
<br />
The fact that we have more hitpoints is irrelevant if we're taking more hits, it balances out.  The ONLY time when hitpoint pool is relevant is if there's a real chance of being one rounded.   If there is, then it's not a group mob, it's a raid target.<br />
<br />
Why you cannot see that this is wrong is beyond me.  <br />
<br />
Not a single monk yet on this thread has said they'd be willing to trade block for parry in return for a mitigation adjustement.  They gloss over that sugestion over time and time again, which is why their honesty is questioned over and over.</div></div><hr />

You're asking for the moon, when all you need is very slight adjustments. Judging from all the stuff I've read so far in various threads, monks need a few things:<br />
<br />
1. Better DPS - Morespecificly, they should have equal DPS with rogue BS.<br />
<br />
2. Viable 360' attack positioning - Repostes will kill monks, and lower the DPS of the &quot;360 degree&quot; DPS class. Currently, only the 180' position is viable, and very crowed. Give monks the ability for attack from any angle through mob defenses, as if it were the mobs back. The frees up the mobs backside which is very crowed, and allows them to be used in mob positioning for raid encounters, because they can attack from any dirrection.<br />
<br />
3. Fix caster mobs, make them stop casting on successful FD - Refund the applicable AAs if neccesary. This is a stupid bug. PC casters have a similar bug, kill 2 with 1 stone.<br />
<br />
4. 360' burst mitigation/avoidance disc /w low cost and short reuse - To help offset some of the damage taken during a difficult pull.  - OR - <br />
<br />
4b. 360' defenseive skills angles - Monks are the masters of martial combat, make their agility mean something. Monks won't take quite as much beating if their avoidance actually worked while running back to the group/raid from a pull. Possibly stun immunity while &quot;fleeing&quot;.<br />
<br />
5. Shorter recast lull ability - Maybe make it have a chance to fail, so there's a choice. Either the sure fire lull that can only be cast on one mob, or one that can be cast on 4 or 5 mobs (numbers subjest to debate) that has a chance to fail.<br />
<br />
Monks never were meant to be tanks, even light tanks, they don't wear chain and don't have a taunt, like the other light tanks (rangers, rogue) do.<br />
<br />
Note: I can't remember who posted about Brodda's parses, but they are just plain wrong. Mitigation numbers don't match, nor do the defense skill numbers. Miss % numbers are calculated wrong. In short, they are a steaming pile of crap. They shouldn't be listed in the library, except with the caveat, &quot;FUBAR'd numbers included for archive reference, DO NOT USE!&quot;. Run the numbers yourself if you don't believe me.</div></div><hr />

Well, I wasn't going to get involved in this little flamefest but the amount of ignorance flying around was lowering my IQ by the minute.<br />
<br />
Okay, this is going to be really long, so be patient.<br />
<br />
For monks, increasing Mitigation &gt;&gt;&gt; Avoidance for the following reasons...<br />
<br />
1) Our low base HPs<br />
2) Mend<br />
3) Feign Death<br />
<br />
Now, if you don't understand why it works out this way, let me spell it out for you.<br />
<br />
In the art of pulling, which I would hope to be able to say I have a better grasp of than the majority of Non-monks here, the most difficult part of executing a successful split is often **Surviving** long enough to either execute the split or get back to camp.<br />
<br />
Due to our LOW BASE HPs (read 80% of a plate tank), the range of mobs that can single round us is much larger than for let's say a warrior. Similarly, when we find ourselves surrounded by more than one mob, the range of situations where we can either die before we reach camp increases dramatically. It doesn't have to be a mob like in Uqua that can kill us quickly, mobs like Quavonis, Reparm, or even hordes of mobs in Vex Thall can do the same.<br />
<br />
It's far too easy to claim that we want less damage over time damage over time, or that damage over time isn't much of a factor. When you've got a single mob beating on you, then it's short spike time calculation. If you've got multiple mobs beating on you, then you have a much larger hit sample. In the end though, when considering our low base HPs, our main consideration is not how much damage we take over a time span, but what is the probability that we will SURVIVE long enough to utilize our Skills and Tools to successfully complete that split or pull.<br />
<br />
Now, there is a broad group of mobs or combinations of mobs that cannot kill a Warrior in a single round (IE, cannot quad even with max hits for more than 10k at say EP level) but CAN single round a monk (read 8k HPs). Note that I'm saying MOBS, ie, can be a single mob or groups of mobs. Even though a monk has the tool of FD and Mend, for both tools the monk must live long enough to utilize those tools.<br />
<br />
So, the argument is that Avoidance, because it reduces the probability of being hit at all, would mean the monk would survive pulls more often.<br />
<br />
Well, Yes and No....<br />
<br />
You see, if you were concerned with surviving a single solitary pull with a very limited set of chances of being hit, then an increased chance of being missed would improve your survivability.<br />
<br />
Let's take a standard example, a hit distribution might look something like this for a monk...<br />
<br />
Min(1-5(20)) Normal (6-16(20)) Max (16-20(20))<br />
25 50 25<br />
<br />
That mob might have a hit rate of let's say 45 percent. That's not an unreasonable number.<br />
<br />
Mob misses : 55%.<br />
Mob hits : 45%<br />
<br />
On a given quad round...<br />
<br />
Probability of 0 hits : 9.1%<br />
Probability of 1 hits : 29.9%<br />
Probability of 2 hits : 36.9%<br />
Probability of 3 hits : 20.0%<br />
Probability of 4 hits : 4.1%<br />
<br />
Probability of hit in the top Quartile (25%)<br />
<br />
So, let's take a fairly typical DB+DI of 300, 75.<br />
<br />
This makes for a minimum hit of 301, maximum hit of 1800 (300 + (20*75)).<br />
<br />
Using that distribution, average damage distribution will look something like this when broken out per quartile...<br />
<br />
Bottom Quartile hits - 25%, average of 337.5<br />
2nd and 3rd Quartile - 50%, average of 1050<br />
4th Quartile - 25%, average of 1612.5<br />
<br />
So, using a simplified probability distribution, we end up with damage per round breaking down like this... (bear with me if the numbers aren't perfect, I whipped these up quick)<br />
<br />
0 hits (9.1%)<br />
<br />
1 hit : (29.9%)<br />
<br />
Minimum hit : 7.475% (337.5)<br />
2nd/3rd quartile : 14.95% (1050)<br />
Maximum hit : 7.475% (1612.5)<br />
<br />
2 hits : (36.9%)<br />
<br />
2 x Minimum hit : 3.6% (675)<br />
1 Minimum, 1 2nd/3rd quartile : 9.225% (1387.5)<br />
2 x 2nd/3rd quartile : 11.25% (2100)<br />
1 2nd/3rd, 1 max : 9.225% (2662.5)<br />
2 x Maximum hit : 3.6% (3225)<br />
<br />
Probability of 3 hits : (20.0%)<br />
<br />
3 x Minimum hit : 0.3125% (1012.5)<br />
2 Min, 1 x 2nd/3rd : 3.75% (1725)<br />
2 Min, 1 x Max : 0.93% (2287.5)<br />
1 Min, 2 x 2nd/3rd : 3.75% (2437.5)<br />
1 Min, 1 x 2nd/3rd, 1 x Max : 1.875% (3000)<br />
1 Min, 2 x max : 0.93% (3562.5)<br />
3 x 2nd/3rd : 2.5% (3150)<br />
2 x 2nd/3rd, 1 x max : 3.75% (3712.5)<br />
1 x 2nd/3rd, 2 x max : 1.875% (4275)<br />
3 x maximum hit : 0.3125% (4837.5)<br />
<br />
Probability of 4 hits : (4.1%)<br />
<br />
4 x minimum : 0.016% (1350)<br />
3 min, 1 2nd/3rd : 0.256% (2062.5)<br />
3 min, 1 max : 0.064% (2625)<br />
2 min, 2 x 2nd/3rd : 0.384% (2775)<br />
2 min, 1 x 2nd/3rd, 1 x max : 0.384% (3337.5)<br />
2 min, 2 x max : 0.096% (3900)<br />
1 min, 3 x 2nd/3rd : 0.513% (3487.5)<br />
1 min, 2 x 2nd/3rd, 1 x max : 0.768% (4050)<br />
1 min, 1 x 2nd/3rd, 2 x max : 0.384% (4612.5)<br />
1 min, 3 x max : 0.064% (5173.5)<br />
4 x 2nd/3rd : 0.256% (4200)<br />
3 x 2nd/3rd, 1 x max : 0.021% (4762.5)<br />
2 x 2nd/3rd, 2 x max : 0.384% (5325)<br />
1 x 2nd/3rd, 3 x max : 0.256% (5887.5)<br />
4 x max : 0.016% (6650)<br />
<br />
So, if these numbers don't mean much, bear with me.<br />
<br />
The objective in successfully executing a pull is to be able to get the mob back into camp in something resembling an orderly (read 1, max 2 mobs) into camp.<br />
<br />
Now, if your monk has 9k hps (read most Time+ monks), a single round of even max hits from this mob isn't going to kill you. However, given that in GoD, mobs run FASTER than Run5, and you are often dealing with a SPLIT of multiple mobs, you are NOT going to take a SINGLE round of damage from a SINGLE mob. If that was the case, you WOULD NOT need a monk to pull.<br />
<br />
A more relevant issue is when you are going to take MORE than one round of melee (read 2 or 3), or you're dealing with 2 to 3 mobs that are all meleeing you (from behind).<br />
<br />
So, if you're a 9k monk, you CAN NOT recieve more than 9k damage in any single round, nor can you recieve more than 9k + mend before you reach camp or you Die.<br />
<br />
Using the above standard percentages, it works out something like this...<br />
<br />
75% - 0 to 2 hits, you will NEVER recieve sufficient damage to Kill you even if you recieve a round of damage from a second mob simultaneously.<br />
<br />
10% - 3 to 4 hits, you will recieve 15% - 3 to 4 hits, you will recieve &gt; 3500 points of damage, meaning there is a probability you will die on a second round of simultaneous damage from a second mob. (0.16%)<br />
<br />
Now, that in itself doesn't seem so bad, but that's the probability of surviving long enough to hit FD (5 to 20% failure rate depending on the zone, 15 to 20% failure rate when fighting in hard zones) and/or mend (we'll assume max critical mend of 27 AA's for an average of 2250 return on 50% fire rate for critical mend).<br />
<br />
So, let's examine the scenarios. Assuming you're dealing with 2 mobs at this level (otherwise why would you need a monk?), then 50% of the time you've taken 3k of damage per mob, or a total of 6k, the other 50% you've gotten lucky and taken 5k or less damage.<br />
<br />
Scenario A <br />
<br />
FD fails (1 in 5) and you hit mend (now have effective hps of 11500, (50% hp return that fires 50%). Refresh on Feign is 5 seconds (with RF3, 36 AA's). With a delay of 20 (slow for mobs of this caliber), the mobs will get an average of 2.5 more rounds. Since you've already lost 6000 hps, you now have 5500 left. You will ONLY survive if over the next 5 attack rounds (2.5 per mob, but let's say 4 total if your FD timing is perfect) you take LESS than 5500 points of damage.<br />
<br />
Using our above scenario, the likelihood of sustaining 4 rounds works something like this...<br />
<br />
Round 1<br />
<br />
40% - killed outright. 5500+ or combination adding up to 5500 killing you.<br />
<br />
Round 2<br />
<br />
75% - killed outright. 5500+ or combination over two rounds adding up to 5500+ killing you.<br />
<br />
Round 3 (if you don't time FD perfectly and it succeeds)<br />
<br />
93% - killed outright. 5500+ or combination over three rounds adding up to 5500+ killing you.<br />
<br />
End result : You are now successfully Feigned (80% probable if you made it through that), your mend is down, and you have not completed the pull. Further attempts to complete the pull will most likely (95%+) result in your death. Note that this doesn't factor in broken feigns from spells, AE effects, late hits due to lag, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Scenario B<br />
<br />
You have a single mob and attempt to bring it to camp. Assume an average pull length of 20 seconds (short pull).<br />
<br />
If you use range 255 items, by the time you turn and run you should have approximately 5 seconds of head start.<br />
<br />
By the 5 second point, the mob has caught up to you and is meleeing you. With a delay of 20, chances of survival look something like this. Assume you hit mend at optimal time so have an operational HPs of 11500.<br />
<br />
7s<br />
<br />
100% chance of survival (unable to 1 round you)<br />
<br />
9s<br />
<br />
99.9% chance of survival (only 2 max rounds can kill you)<br />
<br />
11s<br />
<br />
~ 96% chance of survival (only 3 heavy rounds can kill you)<br />
<br />
13s<br />
<br />
~ 70% chance of survival (4 medium + heavy rounds can kill you)<br />
<br />
15s<br />
<br />
~ 40% chance of survival (5 medium rounds kill you)<br />
<br />
17s<br />
<br />
~ 15% chance of survival (6 rounds of most anything kills you)<br />
<br />
19s<br />
<br />
Don't bother. If you're still getting hit you're most likely dead.<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
Note, that this doesn't factor in AE's, stuns, having multiple mobs on long pulls, getting whacked by bosses and mini-bosses along the way, warping mobs, etc, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
Additionally, this doesn't factor in the fact that your back is to the mob most of the time. In other words, you have ZERO block, 50% of your Normal dodge (if you have the AA's), and NO Riposte. So, take out an additional 6 to 7% of your avoidance.<br />
<br />
Now, for those who would argue that monk avoidance is superior to monk mitigation for purposes of pulling, in actuality it isn't for the following reasons...<br />
<br />
1) Mend is a self-heal that is only usable AFTER you have taken damage. IE, you MUST take hits before it's useful. If you're already dead, don't bother. If you took NO or Few hits, you wouldn't use it.<br />
<br />
2) Feign Death is only useful if you survive the combat round and is often used AFTER you've taken damage. IE, see mend.<br />
<br />
3) An increase in avoidance of let's say 10%, would at best be a 3% improvement over our current mitigation when facing the mob. Since we are NOT facing the mob when pulling, it would have little if any benefit.<br />
<br />
4) If you were to give us 360 degree avoidance, the numbers would be as projected above. IE, we still die a ton.<br />
<br />
Avoidance versus Mitigation...<br />
<br />
Now, let's get back to some numbers. If you want to compare the impact of mitigation versus avoidance, let's take the previous example.<br />
<br />
If we were to slide the DI by 1 (IE, 5% mitigation boost), the end result is as follows...<br />
<br />
Min hits increase from 25% to 30%.<br />
Medium hits stay static at 50%.<br />
Maximum hits decrease from 25 to 20%.<br />
<br />
Subjectively, this is a 20% reduction across the board on maximum hits AND a 20% increase in hits in the bottom quartile. Effectively, this would reduce the probability of dying during a pull Dramatically due to increased opportunities to Mend and Feign.<br />
<br />
But what about increasing avoidance?<br />
<br />
If you were to increase our avoidance by 5% AND NOT make our current avoidance 360 degrees, it would look much like the chart above minus 2% or so, assuming the added avoidance worked in a 360 degree arc.<br />
<br />
Now, this isn't to say increasing avoidance wouldn't help us with pulling (it would), HOWEVER, only Mitigation (reducing average damage per hit) increases our survivability on those pulls where survival is borderline, IE, those mobs that can 1 round us, 2 round us, or swarm us over time. Additionally, increased avoidance does NOT scale with the effectiveness of Feign Death and Mend as it would become harder to use them meaningfully (IE, you're dead before you can use either).<br />
<br />
For a monk, a 20% decrease overall in the probability of being killed after sustaining rounds of damage (read FD or Mended) is far more substantial and useful.<br />
<br />
Now, if you wanted to increase our Avoidance AND give us 360 degree avoidance, then you might have a case. But that would be an increase far beyond our proposed mitigation changes, and would still devalue FD and Mend as pulling and life preservation tools.<br />
<br />
And that sort of avoidance really would put alot of mid and lower level tanks out of a job. IE, where damage spiking to hit mend/fd/heals is not an issue, it really does become damage over time in XP groups.<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
Final notes, for those plate classes that seem SO gung ho on preserving Mitigation gaps but saying that they wouldn't mind seeing a major drop in DPS for plate tanks or major upgrade for Monks and rogues, you should keep in mind the following.<br />
<br />
During Late Velious and early Luclin when Plate tanks were really hurting, the problem wasn't just mitigation.<br />
<br />
The problem is this... TANKING is NOT STACKABLE.<br />
<br />
DPS roles ARE stackable.<br />
<br />
What that meant is that on a raid you had your MT's, a couple Offtanks, and the rest were DPS classes. This was the same deal in Groups.<br />
<br />
If you were to scale Plate classes to the level of DPS disparity that you seem to want to exist for mitigation, what you'll see is a TON of warriors, SK's and Paladins who are all LFG or useless on raids. Anyone remember the days of &quot;DPS classes only?&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the primary reasons they closed the DPS gap between warriors, monks and rogues so much was so that there would be roles for them in groups and in Raids. Unfortunately, by leaving the mitigation gap so wide, it left monks without a job. IE, can't tank, poor DPS, low HP's, no utility, low survivability.<br />
<br />
Now, as a monk you could argue that there's a need for that sort of DPS gap, but think about what you're saying. For those who think we need to be scaled up to 20%, it USED to be 40%.<br />
<br />
In Velious and Luclin, the DPS gap was this...<br />
<br />
Hybrid plate : 0.8<br />
Warriors 1.0<br />
Monks 1.4<br />
Rogues 1.8<br />
<br />
Currently, it's more like this<br />
<br />
Hybrid plate : 0.9<br />
Warrior 1.0<br />
Monks 1.2<br />
Rogues 1.4<br />
<br />
And through all this, we got jacked on HPs (lost 10% relative), jacked on Mitigation (lost 20% Relative to other classes), jacked on utility (hello Death Peace, Lull, Fading memories, Pacify, Outdoor Zones), jacked on survivability (hello run5+ mobs, massive AE's, AE Rampage, 2k+ ripostes), jacked on DPS (hello Windblade, SK/Pallie/Warrior 2hd weapons raining like Water and crap monk weapon itemization), and jacked on our core DPS roles (hello short burst DPS fights, overpowered pets, CoD, insane mana regen).<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't MIND that a warrior, SK or Paladin is a bit closer in DPS. I'd rather just have our mitigation back. It would make us Passable tanks and offtanks in group content, would make us more effective at pulling, and would let plate classes keep having spots in groups and on raids other than Tanking.<br />
<br />
Those of you who remember the days when a plate tank couldn't get a group to save your lives or felt useless on raids, it wasn't due to mitigation, it was due to mitigation + DPS gaps + mobs who hit like wimps + easily mezzable mobs.<br />
<br />
I GUARANTEE if you were to put the DPS gap between monks and plate classes to the same levels that you want the mitigation gaps to continue at, most of the plate classes will be exactly where they started in Velious and Luclin. IE, one trick ponies (tank/offtank).<br />
<br />
A group needs 1 tank, 1 slower/CC, 1 healer, and 3 DPS classes. And guess what, if you reinstate DPS gaps, that DPS WON'T be SK's, Paladins and Warriors.<br />
<br />
So, remove the innate mitigation penalty (fixes mid and low-level monks), remove the softcap (600 AC, 2k HPs and lots of taunt tools should be enough), and create some better itemization in the middle monk levels to compete with bazaar bows, windblades, etc.<br />

The TribunalStill think Avoidance &gt; Mitigation for pullers?<br />
<br />
I'll fully concede that Avoidance is better for Tanks.<br />
<br />
But if you are ever in a situation where the damage you're subject to is possibly greater than what you can withstand in one round, then you'll be looking for any way to make those spikes more survivable.<br />
<br />
Avoidance won't change the size of the spike.<br />
<br />
Neither will mitigation ( other than straight DI bonuses ).<br />
<br />
But Mitigation sure as hell makes them significantly less likely than the same level of Avoidance would.<br />
<br />
And increasing our Avoidance too much more than it is will have us taking significantly less damage over time than even you Warriors.<br />
<br />
Food for thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">Monks never were meant to be tanks, even light tanks, they don't wear chain and don't have a taunt, like the other light tanks (rangers, rogue) do.<br />
<br />
Rogues don't have Taunt, although BS is actually a damn fine way to gain aggro if they want it. *grin*<br />
<br />
Avoidance won't change the size of the spike.<br />
<br />
Neither will mitigation ( other than straight DI bonuses ).<br />
<br />
But Mitigation sure as hell makes them significantly less likely than the same level of Avoidance would.<br />
<br />
Well Monks aren't going to be able to keep their current levels of avoidance and gain additional mitigation.  Regardless of the &quot;pulling&quot; justification behind it, it would give them the best of both worlds, best avoidance in the game and extremely good, if not the best, mitigation in the game.  Sorry, that's not going to fly, for exactly the reasons that have already been stated over and over again.<br />
<br />
Now, if Monks were willing to take a significant down grade in avoidance in exchange for a mitigation increase, I could see that as a possiblity.  The problem of course being that they're not going to get mitigation much better than say a Ranger, without the Knights getting their panties in a serious twist, and rightfully so.  And the combination of the two, avoidance and mitigation, can't put Monks in a significantly better damage taking position in the long term than they're currently at, or they begin to out tank Knights and rival Warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Xainn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">the combination of the two, avoidance and mitigation, can't put Monks in a significantly better damage taking position in the long term than they're currently at, or they begin to out tank Knights and rival Warriors.<br />
Well...<br />
<br />
I could agree if the only factor of import to Tanking was damage over time.<br />
<br />
However, from my admittedly non-tanking view point, isn't there also<br />
<br />
1) The size of the spike<br />
2) The likelihood of a spike<br />
3) The ability to generate Aggro<br />
4) The ability to establish Aggro<br />
<br />
1) can be dealt with by either a straight DI bonus ( which Warriors have ) or Superior HP ( which Warriors and Knights have ).  Superior HP would mean larger spikes can be survived, of course.<br />
<br />
2) can be dealt with by increased mitigation in the form of superior AC ( which both Warriors and Knights have )<br />
<br />
3) Monks with WA5 and geared specifically for aggro generation ( which generally means a loss of DPS ) would most likely surpass a Warrior's ability to generate aggro through procs and DPS alone.  This is an inherent limitation to all High DPS classes, after all.<br />
<br />
But no Monk anywhere, no matter what his aggro set up, will ever rival a Knight for aggro generation.<br />
<br />
4) While there is a subtle difference between this and point 3), it's still significant, is it not?  Wasn't it a Warrior's relative difficulty in grabbing snap aggro that made Knights the preferred exp tanks in early PoP?<br />
<br />
Monks have no form of snap aggro, and shouldn't have, imo.<br />
<br />
So, even if Monk mitigation were to be &quot;restored&quot; ( and by that I mean AC point for AC point equivalent to Knights' both pre and post soft cap ), how would we stack up as &quot;Tanks&quot;?<br />
<br />
Let's start from this assumption:<br />
<br />
---<br />
If Monks could mitigate AC point for AC point pre and post softcap the same as Knights, then Monks would take damage over time comparable to a comparably equipped Warrior.<br />
---<br />
<br />
IF that were to be made true, then how would that effect who gets picked for MT?<br />
<br />
Let's compare and contrast the three current Tanking classes ( Warrior, Pally, SK ) vs this hypothetical unNerf'd Monk.<br />
<br />
Let's further assume that all four classes are geared comparably for the same level of play.<br />
<br />
Warriors:<br />
...Pros:<br />
1) Innate DI bonus<br />
2) Taunt<br />
3) Incite<br />
4) Access to weapons with better aggro procs ( direct Hate procing weapons )<br />
5) Access to augments which grant better aggro procs ( AngerIII vs Ykesha )<br />
6) Access to more HP<br />
7) Access to more AC<br />
8) Access to more Shielding mods<br />
9) Access to more Strikethru mods<br />
10) Strikethru AAs<br />
11) The ability to /shield a party member if their snap aggro proves insufficient.<br />
<br />
...Cons<br />
1) Inferior frontal DPS to Monks<br />
2) Comparatively lower proc rate assuming Monks have WA5<br />
3) Less access to Avoidance mods<br />
<br />
...Comparisons<br />
1) In aggro generation, the Monk will most likely have an edge over time. The Warrior's superior procs ( on weapons and augs ) will probably be overshadowed by the Monk's superior proc rate and superior Frontal DPS. The Monk's Frontal DPS will be lower than it would be if he were behind the mob, but I believe it's still at least marginally better than a Warrior's ( honestly not sure how it would stack up with typical distribution of Strikethru since I do not know what &quot;typical&quot; levels of Strikethru are for each class ).<br />
<br />
Monks could most likely hold aggro as well as a Warrior, given enough time to establish it.<br />
<br />
2) The Warrior's superiority in AC and Shielding Mods is offset by the monk's superiority in Innate Avoidance and Avoidance Mods. After all, our starting assumption was that both classes would take comparable damage over time.<br />
<br />
3) The Warrior still has a HP advantage. That advantage is further extended by the fact that the Warrior will have a significantly lower average damage per hit due to the DI bonus as well as Superior AC.<br />
<br />
So the Warrior will be significantly easier to heal than the Monk. This can have varying degrees of importance. If the encounter is such that healing even the Monk is trivial ( tanking orc pawns, for example ), than this advantage is a wash.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, how often do we tank orc pawns any more?<br />
<br />
4) The Warrior still has Snap Aggro capabilities, which the Monk completely lacks. Again, this can have varying degrees of importance. If the encounter is such that even the squishy classes can take a few rounds of getting beat on, then the Monk could probably reacquire aggro eventually.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, they're called the &quot;squishy&quot; classes for a reason.<br />
<br />
However, Chanters would still hate letting a Monk break mez, for obvious reasons.<br />
<br />
My conclusion:<br />
Warriors would still be &quot;the&quot; preferred MT for any content worth doing.<br />
<br />
Monks would WTFPwn Warriors when tanking orc pawns.<br />
<br />
( yes, hyperbole, but hopefully you see the point I'm trying to make )<br />
<br />
Paladins:<br />
...Pros<br />
1) Taunt<br />
2) Access to more HP<br />
3) Access to more AC<br />
4) Access to more Shielding mods<br />
5) High aggro/Fast cast stuns<br />
6) Stuns with which to &quot;Avoid&quot; damage<br />
7) Self-Heals with which to &quot;Mitigate&quot; damage<br />
8) Other Spell based Utility which has a direct bearing on Tanking ( Self HP/AC buffs )<br />
9) Other Spell based Utility which does not have a direct bearing on Tanking ( Group Buffs, Group Heals, Rezzes )<br />
<br />
...Cons<br />
1) By the initial assumption, Paladins would take more damage over time than Monks.<br />
2) Significantly lower Frontal DPS than a Tanking Monk.<br />
<br />
...Comparisons<br />
1) In aggro generation, the Paladin wins. No contest. This would allow every other DPSing member of that Paladin's group to &quot;turn it up a notch&quot;. Assuming 1 Pally MT, 1 Main Healer, 1 Slower, that leaves 3 other DPS classes doing more DPS sooner than in the Warrior group, let alone in the Monk group.<br />
<br />
The Paladin's ability through aggro lock to increase the DPS of his groupmates, a well as allowing them to apply that damage sooner, will almost certainly offset the Monk's innate DPS superiority.<br />
<br />
2) Paladins will still have access to more AC than Monks and will therefore take damage at least marginally smoother, which means at least a slightly easier time healing them.<br />
<br />
They may wind up requiring more heals, but they won't have quite the &quot;twitch factor&quot; that the Monk Tank would.<br />
<br />
Again, this can have varying degrees of importance, just as with Warriors.<br />
<br />
3) Paladins will still have a HP advantage over Monks. Not to the scale that Warriors enjoy, but still there, none the less. And as with the Warrior/Monk comparison, this too can have varying degrees of importance.<br />
<br />
4) Paladins have probably the best Snap aggro in the game. Should they fall asleep while tanking and actually lose aggro, getting it back is as simple as hitting a button ( unless the squishy caster got low health aggro, in which case the Paladin can simply rez them back and give them a cookie ).<br />
<br />
5) I'm really unsure of the feasibility of Paladins self-healing during combat, so will not address that. However, when tanking Mobs that are not stun immune, it's my impression that Paladins can &quot;avoid&quot; a significant amount of damage over time through the use of those stuns. Enough to allow them to compete with Warriors and an unNerf'd Monk in the damage over time category? I don't know.<br />
<br />
6) Thru the use of their self buffs, Paladins can further increase their already potentially significant leads ( over the Monk ) in HP and AC. I don't know whether they are capable of currently encroaching on Warrior values in those stats.<br />
<br />
7) Thru the use of their other non-tanking specific utilities, Paladins further enhance their desirability as a group member.<br />
<br />
My conclusion:<br />
Paladins would still be preferred over Monks as tanks on worthwhile content.<br />
<br />
Paladins may actually be preferred over Warriors on less difficult content, given a high DPS/high Aggro group make up.<br />
<br />
Monks would still WTFPwn Paladins when tanking orc pawns.<br />
<br />
Shadow Knights:<br />
...Pros<br />
1) Taunt<br />
2) Access to more HP<br />
3) Access to more AC<br />
4) Access to more Shielding mods<br />
5) High aggro/Fast cast spells<br />
6) Lifetaps with which to &quot;Mitigate&quot; damage<br />
7) Hate increasing Spells<br />
8) Other Spell based Utility which has a direct bearing on Tanking ( Atk buffs which would increase DPS and therefore increase aggro generation )<br />
9) Other Spell based Utility which does not have a direct bearing on Tanking ( FD, Invis, pet pulling )<br />
<br />
...Cons<br />
1) By the initial assumption, ShadowKnights would take more damage over time than Monks.<br />
2) Significantly lower Frontal DPS than a Tanking Monk. Not as low as a Paladin, but still significant, I believe.<br />
<br />
...Comparisons<br />
1) In aggro generation, see Paladin and then add Hate increasing spells. Knights are apparently designed to be the masters of snap aggro.<br />
<br />
2) Like Paladins, SKs will still have more AC than comparably equipped Monks.<br />
<br />
3) Like Paladins, Sks will still have more HP than comparably equipped Monks.<br />
<br />
4) SK snap aggro is at the very least comparable to Paladin snap aggro.<br />
<br />
The only difference being, imo, if the SK falls asleep and loses aggro, he can either hit the button and get it back or he could FD, let the mob wipe the rest of the group, and then steal the cookies that the Paladin passed out earlier.<br />
( Evil bastages ).<br />
<br />
5) SKs can actually recover a significant amount of HP through Lifetapping. Enough to allow them to compete with Warriors and an unNerf'd Monk in the damage over time category? I don't know.<br />
<br />
6) I don't know enough about SKs tank-specific utility spells to really comment on them.<br />
<br />
7) Thru the use of their other non-tanking specific utilities, SKs further enhance their desirability as a group member, perhaps not as much as a Paladin, however. Though letting the tank also be the puller is pretty handy at times, which SKs can do for much longer than Paladins due to Pacify immunity issues.<br />
<br />
My conclusion:<br />
SKs would still be preferred over Monks as tanks on worthwhile content.<br />
<br />
SKs would be a good tank/puller if the group needed more tanking than pulling, though a skilled SK can shame even a veteran Monk as a puller if he wants to.<br />
<br />
Monks would probably not WTFPwn SKs when tanking orc pawns.<br />
( Those BASTAGES ).<br />
<br />
Monks:<br />
...Pros<br />
1) Higher Frontal DPS<br />
2) Significantly Increased Proc Rate ( after WA5 )<br />
3) Access to higher Avoidance mods<br />
4) Pulling and initial aggro<br />
5) By the initial assumption, same damage over time as a Warrior<br />
6) Eventually generate more aggro than most Warriors, if set up for it ( doing so impinges at least slightly on DPS, however )<br />
7) Typically much faster weapons which means more swings, which means more aggro generation ( questionable since changes in 2H aggro generation )<br />
8) Mend/Crit Mend<br />
<br />
...Cons<br />
1) Lowest HP of the four &quot;contenders&quot;<br />
2) Lowest AC and therefore worst mitigation of the four &quot;contenders&quot;<br />
3) Absolutely no Snap aggro<br />
4) Typically much faster weapons which means more frequent ripostes<br />
<br />
Comparisons:<br />
1) In aggro generation, a Monk will most likely eventually overtake a comparably equipped Warrior. This is as it should be. When not tanking, a Monk should have to watch his aggro just like anyone else.<br />
<br />
What this would mean in practice, however, is the rest of the group would have to wait for the Monk to establish aggro. Since establishing that aggro is entirely RNG dependent for the Monk, on challenging content, it could prove to simply take longer to establish that aggro than the Monk's HP can afford to wait for a heal. Especially considering that Monks would be taking damage spikes comparable to a significantly lesser equipped Knight.<br />
<br />
Healing the Monk would still be twitchier than healing any other tank. Just not as twitchy as it is n... oh, nm, the Monk's already dead.<br />
<br />
2) Unnerf'd Monks should always have less AC and HP than comparably equipped Knights. The trade off for this would be our superior avoidance and subsequent advantage in reduced damage over time.<br />
<br />
BTW, This is pretty handy, because ( Tuh Dah... ) we currently do have less HP and AC.<br />
<br />
3) Monk Snap Aggro doesn't exist. Should any member of the Monk Tank group pull aggro off that Monk, it's totally random when that Monk will be able to pull it off. The Monk could get a lucky proc before the squishy one gets low health aggro lock, or the careless squishy could die.<br />
<br />
Not very appetizing if you're squishy, I'd imagine<br />
<br />
( I suppose you could carry a bag of snare glands to try and grab clicky aggro with, but if you do, you should have rolled a damn SK ).<br />
<br />
So if the Monk looses aggro, he's is pretty much relegated to stealing cookies.<br />
<br />
( Cookies &gt; Pie &gt; Cake. ESPECIALLY FRUIT FILLED COOKIES. And they travel better, too! )<br />
<br />
4) Monks have Mend, which should also be factored in to the damage over time considerations.<br />
<br />
Assuming buffed HP of 10800, and a Crit Mend rate of 25%, if the Monk chained Mend every 6 minutes, that would come out to be a max reduction to damage over time of 9.375 DPS assuming the Monk was taking steady damage for at least 24 minutes and that he got to use the full value of each Mend, even the Crit one.<br />
<br />
Of course, Healers tend to get a bit nervous when they hear a Monk tell them, &quot;Don't heal me unless I get below 40%, just in case I Crit Mend...&quot;<br />
<br />
Nervous Nellies. /pfft<br />
<br />
My conclusion:<br />
Even if Monks were competent in the role ( which is debatable, given the nature of &quot;worthwhile content&quot; ), Monks would not be preferred as tanks on worthwhile content.<br />
<br />
The combination of worse mitigation than a Knight and no Snap aggro whatsoever isn't enough to offset the bonus of taking damage over time comparable to a Warrior.<br />
<br />
We could certainly tank anything below our gear level much better than we do now, perhaps even better than some of the other tanks.<br />
<br />
In short, on worthwhile content we couldn't really compete with the additional safety that the other Tanks bring to the Tanking role. Warriors through mitigation and Knights through aggro lock.<br />
<br />
Overall conclusion:<br />
<br />
Even with mitigation equal to a Knight ( AC point for AC point both pre and post soft cap ), a Monk would be better utilized as Puller and DPS in any group that had access to a Plate Tank.<br />
<br />
Now....<br />
<br />
What WOULD happen, though, that would piss you all off to no end...<br />
<br />
Is that when you Warriors were grouped with a Monk, some of them would be asshats.<br />
<br />
They'd make you fight for aggro and take a few hits, basically f'ing with you while you were trying to do your job as Tank.<br />
<br />
And since they'd take damage over time comparably to how you do, they could get away with it.<br />
<br />
I honestly think that it was this kind of behavior that pissed so many of you off so much.<br />
<br />
Because honestly, there is so much more to tanking than merely damage over time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">The problem of course being that they're not going to get mitigation much better than say a Ranger, without the Knights getting their panties in a serious twist, and rightfully so<br />
<br />
This is all that needs to be said in this thread really.  Warriors have the blinders on heh? One thing that can always be counted on in this game is the whining of classes. You seriously think knights are going to sit by and be content with the monk nerf being removed? Lol Helllllll no, you are dreaming if you think otherwise.  They will parse, test, and scream even harder to be upgraded closer to warriors, and now they will have good reason. I don't feel like PoP class balance returning where warriors are once again relegated to being the preferred tank only on the top end mobs.<br />
<br />
Pretty obvious really why warriors are very defensive about migitation increases to other classes the way it is currently set up, if you cannot see why, well its you that is freaking blind, not us. Can make as many comparison tests as you want to try and &quot;educate&quot; us how the tanking game works, I know exactly what will happen. Some of us have been doing this too long to be fooled otherwise.<br />
<br />
I am all for things like faster innate run speed, more dps through itemisation/skills, hell even more hp, I agree monks need some sort of upgrade. But I doubt Monks would  EVER support warrior dps or pulling upgrades, not sure why you expect otherwise for migitation here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Dobbanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">Multiple things here. First of all, returning our old mitigation to us would not return us to the old days unless soe also reinstituted the hard cap at 1200-1400 whatever the heck it was back then. As for taking less damage, yes, we take less damage, OVER HUGE FREAKING STRETCHES OF TIME! Over the course of an actual exp group fight, you will find the numbers are much different with monks back down the list to below probably every melee type including the hybrids. You see, as you folks are so fond of bringing up when you have nothing else to add, monks have an avoidance advantage, we avoid a couple more hits a minute. Therefore, as long as our damage taken per hit isnt correspondingly higher than it is now, we will slowly catch up to the plate classes in damage taken over time. A little more with each miss, block, dodge, and riposte that isnt matched by one from you. The longer the parse, the lower our average goes. Im sure there is a limit somewhere, a point where the average cant get any lower but im willing to bet that if you continued the parse long enough, you would see monks as they currently are taking obscenely less damage over time than warriors. <br />
<br />
Now, does this make monks the superior tank? Have we been deluded all this time by letting mere warriors tank when in fact monks are so obviously superior? No? Why not? Could it be becuase damage over time isnt the moneymaker, its damage per hit that groups really care about?  As an extremem example, a group doesnt care if both a monk and a warrior will take 20k damage in a fight, what they DO care about is that warriors will take that damage over 10 rounds of combat while a monk will take that damage in 5. It doesnt matter if the monk wouldnt have gotten hit for the last 5 rounds of combat because he will allready be dead. And while that wont happen every time, it will happen enough so that no group with half a brain would ever risk taking a monk tank when a warrior or knight is available. <br />
<br />
If our mitigation is increased to its old levels and our softcap is altered to match the knight class, we will still be hit harder more often, and we will still be weaker at tanking (two seperate things there) than knights, let alone warriors. Because once again, damage taken over long periods of time doesnt mean squat when an average fight lasts less than a minute. Who gets hit harder? Monks. Who has the least hp? Monks. Who has the least ac? Monks. Who has the least snap agro? Monks. Stacked up against all that, is being missed 6% more often REALLY a big enough difference to make you take the monk anyways? Be honest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Xainn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">But I doubt Monks would  EVER support warrior dps or pulling upgrades, not sure why you expect otherwise for migitation here.<br />
<br />
Kind of like the DPS upgrade you already got after Luclin?<br />
<br />
I'll requote itFinal notes, for those plate classes that seem SO gung ho on preserving Mitigation gaps but saying that they wouldn't mind seeing a major drop in DPS for plate tanks or major upgrade for Monks and rogues, you should keep in mind the following.<br />
<br />
During Late Velious and early Luclin when Plate tanks were really hurting, the problem wasn't just mitigation.<br />
<br />
The problem is this... TANKING is NOT STACKABLE.<br />
<br />
DPS roles ARE stackable.<br />
<br />
What that meant is that on a raid you had your MT's, a couple Offtanks, and the rest were DPS classes. This was the same deal in Groups.<br />
<br />
If you were to scale Plate classes to the level of DPS disparity that you seem to want to exist for mitigation, what you'll see is a TON of warriors, SK's and Paladins who are all LFG or useless on raids. Anyone remember the days of &quot;DPS classes only?&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the primary reasons they closed the DPS gap between warriors, monks and rogues so much was so that there would be roles for them in groups and in Raids. Unfortunately, by leaving the mitigation gap so wide, it left monks without a job. IE, can't tank, poor DPS, low HP's, no utility, low survivability.<br />
<br />
Now, as a monk you could argue that there's a need for that sort of DPS gap, but think about what you're saying. For those who think we need to be scaled up to 20%, it USED to be 40%.<br />
<br />
In Velious and Luclin, the DPS gap was this...<br />
<br />
Hybrid plate : 0.8<br />
Warriors 1.0<br />
Monks 1.4<br />
Rogues 1.8<br />
<br />
Currently, it's more like this<br />
<br />
Hybrid plate : 0.9<br />
Warrior 1.0<br />
Monks 1.2<br />
Rogues 1.4<br />
<br />
And through all this, we got jacked on HPs (lost 10% relative), jacked on Mitigation (lost 20% Relative to other classes), jacked on utility (hello Death Peace, Lull, Fading memories, Pacify, Outdoor Zones), jacked on survivability (hello run5+ mobs, massive AE's, AE Rampage, 2k+ ripostes), jacked on DPS (hello Windblade, SK/Pallie/Warrior 2hd weapons raining like Water and crap monk weapon itemization), and jacked on our core DPS roles (hello short burst DPS fights, overpowered pets, CoD, insane mana regen).<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't MIND that a warrior, SK or Paladin is a bit closer in DPS. I'd rather just have our mitigation back. It would make us Passable tanks and offtanks in group content, would make us more effective at pulling, and would let plate classes keep having spots in groups and on raids other than Tanking.<br />
<br />
Those of you who remember the days when a plate tank couldn't get a group to save your lives or felt useless on raids, it wasn't due to mitigation, it was due to mitigation + DPS gaps + mobs who hit like wimps + easily mezzable mobs.<br />
<br />
I GUARANTEE if you were to put the DPS gap between monks and plate classes to the same levels that you want the mitigation gaps to continue at, most of the plate classes will be exactly where they started in Velious and Luclin. IE, one trick ponies (tank/offtank).<br />
<br />
A group needs 1 tank, 1 slower/CC, 1 healer, and 3 DPS classes. And guess what, if you reinstate DPS gaps, that DPS WON'T be SK's, Paladins and Warriors.That looks remarkably like a Monk advocating ( after the fact ) a Warrior DPS upgrade.<br />
<br />
Our goal is not to displace Warriors or Knights as Tanks.<br />
<br />
Our goal is not to relegate anyone to &quot;one trick pony&quot; status.<br />
<br />
Overwhelmingly, our goal is simply to pull better through mitigation, with some of us wanting a &quot;more viable&quot; Tanking capability.<br />
<br />
Not viable enough to replace the three Plate Tanks.  We'd never have your mitigation ( in comparable gear ) or your Snap aggro ( ever ).<br />
<br />
But viable enough to be a less distant alternative than we currently are.<br />
<br />
We'd like to be able to do something besides tradeskill or pharm 2 expansion old content when we can't find anyone else available to Tank.<br />

How can the one class that specializes in tanking not understand how it works? Let me ask you something. If they took away your Anger procs and your taunt and your incite but gave you a boost to your mitigation  (over what you have now) would you be ok with that? I doubt it.

<br />
how the hell can we explain snap agro to you guys in a way you'll understand? It's like you should know in the same way we should know about pulling.

<br />
By the middle of Luclin, plenty of us were asshats to Warriors.<br />
<br />
See, unlike every other class that Warriors would ever group with regularly, we'd play the &quot;Let's see if your aggro can keep up with mine, Tank /scoff&quot;.<br />
<br />
And when it didn't, we'd take the hits.  As well if not better than they did.<br />
<br />
And we'd laugh and FD and &quot;let&quot; them do their jobs, if we felt so inclined.<br />
<br />
Some of us were asshats.<br />
<br />
We poked them in their pride.<br />
<br />
There they were, the success of the group riding on their shoulders, everyone in that group depending on them to do a job that they had built in limitations on accomplishing.<br />
<br />
Everyone but us.<br />
<br />
Because at the time, we too could take the hits.<br />
<br />
And we had better aggro generation.<br />
<br />
Given the number of FotM Monk twinks that abounded at the time, it's hardly surprising.<br />
<br />
And the old time warriors remember.<br />
<br />
And that is why, no matter what numbers we show them, no matter how convincingly we prove that EQ has changed, no matter how currently unappetizing the class may be to the FotM crowd...<br />
<br />
They still haven't forgiven us.<br />
<br />
And honestly, we haven't even asked for it.<br />
<br />
And given the nature of the die-hard players of each class, we probably never will and neither will they.<br />
<br />
It's just kinda sad to me, I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I honestly think that it was this kind of behavior that pissed so many of you off so much. <br />
<br />
Yes, I don't deny that it pissed some of us off.  I certainly recall being annoyed as hell to find that my guild Monks not only, with easy to acquire low AC bazaar crap, had AC similar to mine while I was sporting a combination of Champions and Indo which were much harder to obtain at the time, but also didn't take damage noticably worse than I did because they had better avoidance.  This was around mid Velious.<br />
<br />
And then when I joined a raiding guild and found that NToV was outfitting Monks in gear EQUAL to Warrior gear, it really torqued me.  Here was a class that not only was getting pretty easy to acquire AC in the low tier game, but were actually getting SUPERIOR to Warrior AC in the high tier game to go along with their better avoidance.<br />
<br />
Monks could and did out aggro control Warriors, because they had higher DPS.  Monks still have significantly higher DPS with the possible exception of the highest tier Warriors compared to the highest tier Monks.  The run of the mill Warrior sure isn't getting anywhere near Monk DPS levels.  And because Monks were typically the puller as well, they had a leg up on the aggro list once the mob got to camp.  If a Monk wanted to play aggro games it was pretty close to impossible to take it from him.  Even if you got a successful taunt, he'd have aggro back the very next round.  The one big thing they didn't have was the ability to taunt a mob off someone else who gained it's attention inadvertantly.  But since taunt works so like crap anyway, this didn't really require a group to dramatically change their normal play styles, except that they could do a bit higher damage on the average due to the higher DPS of the Monk.<br />
<br />
Most of the things that made Monks overpowered in Velious and Luclin are still in place.  Monk DPS is still excellent.  Taunt still works like crap.  And while Warriors have additional tools to acquire aggro, it may still be possible a Monk using aggro weapons and intentionally attempting to get aggro could do so with impunity.  If they could take the hits.  Which as it stands currently, they can't.  Well actually they can, but it's risky because their tanking is &quot;streaky&quot; and when they get hit they get hit hard.  If their mitigation is significantly improved then we're back to where they still avoid far better and take a hit almost as well.<br />
<br />
This is not where the tank classes care to go.  We've been down that road before, and it sucked.</div></div><hr />

We used to be one of those &quot;Tank classes&quot;, Glatius, even if some of us didn't fully appreciate what a difficult time you Warriors had of it.<br />
<br />
We were just never supposed to be better than you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Equal but different&quot; until hardcap and itemization gave us an advantage and the attitude of a few fucked it up.<br />
<br />
Such is life, I guess.<br />
<br />
As far as Knights, who gives a shit about Knights?<br />
<br />
We, as in Warriors and Monks, are pure melee.<br />
<br />
We don't have spell books.  We don't wiggle our fingers at mobs.<br />
<br />
We smack the bitches upside their skulls and piss out our names in pools of their blood.<br />
<br />
That used to mean something.<br />
<br />
There's room in EQ for two &quot;casting&quot; Tanks.<br />
<br />
A mitigation based one ( SKs with their Lifetaps ) and an Avoidance based one ( Paladins with their stuns ).<br />
<br />
There's even room for the perfect Transition Tank ( Ranger with WS and Ranger FD /snicker ).<br />
<br />
But because of the behavior of a few asshat Monk Twinks ( that most likely aren't even playing their Monks any more, having long since switched to BeastLords or Bards ) and the long wounded pride of a long held down Warrior class, there's no room for an avoidance based pure melee Tank, even with all of the natural limitations that Monks would inevitably bring to that role.<br />
<br />
AC Hardcap and lazy itemization allowed us to become too good once.<br />
<br />
And we reveled in it, even those that hadn't paid their dues.<br />
<br />
And wounded Warrior pride will make sure we can never ever do it again.<br />

And here is where many Warriors clearly disagree with many Monks.  Many Warrior feel that Monks should have been at best &quot;light&quot; tanks, capable of tanking about on par with a Ranger.  And not with a Knight nor a Warrior.  In fact it seems to only be Monks who are of the opinion that they should be &quot;Equal but different&quot; to Warriors.

Your right about one thing, that is where we should be, that is where we want to be, not above Warriors, not above Knights, Near Rangers. We are currently near Druids and Shamen. Please don't point to a parse unless you made it yourself. And then i want to ask questions about the parse. I don't think you guys understand how the spikes hurt us. how that one time avoidance fails twice in a row we need a heal or we're going to die. or how Red con mobs cut right through avoidance. Its true test it out, we may have 40% avoidance to a blue con but a red con it's like 3% or less.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I have heard Monks claim over and over again that they mitigate worse than a Druid, yet the parses that show this also show that they take far less damage than a Druid or even a Ranger for that matter.  If you'd like to convince us that your mitigation is so completely hosed that your avoidance isn't compensating for it, then provide some parses that back that up.  Because of course you're the one making the claim that things as they stand aren't working correctly.</div></div><hr />

Coming from the &quot;champion&quot; of the casual side of the casual versus raider debate, it saddens me to see you take this stance.<br />
<br />
Those same parses do indeed show that monks without plane of time gear (where all the +avoidance &quot;GEAR&quot; comes from) aren't doing what Thep's monk was doing.<br />
<br />
I remember distinctly, a certain prevailing opinion on TSW about how warriors should be able to get aggro without needing RAID-LEVEL loot (i.e. Enraging Blow weapons).<br />
<br />

<br />
Excuse me, but I made no mention of PoTime gear.  Avoidance is what Monks at all levels use, you know Parry, Block, and Dodge.  Monks claim that they can't mitigate for crap.  Fine, but we all know they avoid damage better than any other class in the game.  We haven't been shown in the least that when it comes to substained DPS that Monks take markedly more than Rangers at any tier.  If you want to run some parses comparing a mid range Monk versus a mid range Ranger and the actual DPS taken by the Monk is more than the for the Ranger, that might be something of note, something to be concerned about.<br />
<br />
But this crap about Monks mitigating worse than a Druid, as long as we don't consider the fact that they get hit far less often than the Druid, is just that, crap.   What is really relevant is how much damage over a set period of time are both classes taking?  And if Monks are going to claim that the DPS taken over a period of time is irrelevant because the damage they take is &quot;streaky&quot; and therefore they're more prone to being one or two rounded, then it seems like Monks should be all for giving up avoidance in order to gain mitigation.  So they'll be hit more frequently, but for less damage.  Yet not one, not a single Monk, has stepped forward to advocate that.  Instead they're all about wanting their avoidance maintained and being granted more mitigation.<br />
<br />
But anyway, thanks for taking my comments and twisting them into something they weren't intended to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Here is the thing. originally, I mean way back in the long ago days, before high end velious and Luclin came around, that was what monks were. Well more or less, I tend to think we did a better job of tanking than rangers at least. And no, most monks DONT want to tank on par with warriors, we want our ac to mean what it does for knights. Im talking softcaps here, not that we want to tank with 1800 ac like we have 2200 or something stupid like that. Anyways, back to the long ago time. I started out my monk in Kunark level gear, which made sense since I started at the release of kunark. :p I found, that while I was able to take a hit decently, I just didnt have the hp of a warrior who would also take hits better than me on top of it. I thought that was a fair trade. I was still a fairly casual player, I wasnt even a visitor of any boards at the times when the hybrids started their campaign to get boosted up to nearly full tank status with a well rounded spellbook thrown in for good measure. Now, I was still playing during velious although at that time I was leveling up my druid. In fact, I didnt even buy velious until my druid hit 29 and was able to start soloing there lol. <br />
<br />
Once again, I later switched back to my monk, this time twinking him in the best gear I could afford, which wasnt very good, I gave a 19 monk the gear of a 52 kunark/velious geared monk. Now I was able to solo and did well in groups and generally kicked serious ass.  A couple of times I even acted as main tank in an exp group, but only when the other tanks involved were both lower level and had less ac/hp through being majorly underequipped. I think the vision in regards to monks really started to lose its way in late kunark to be honest. When you coupled a low ac hardcap with mudflation, you start seeing more and more classes hitting the hardcap and mitigating the same as even the best warrior, so only the hp came into play, that and agro control. It got to be the point where ANY class could tank because even the casters were hitting the softcap, and barring certain zones, the mobs didnt really hit hard enough to require real tanks.  It was probably the darkest time for warriors since THE ultimate tank was now getting outclassed because of ridiculous itemization issues, hybrids getting their skill caps raised, taunt being virtually worthless and every other class, namely monks and knights that were starting to be in direct competition with you as tanks were able to create and maintain superior agro to you.<br />
<br />
Obviously, we shouldnt ever return to those days, but dont you see that we CANT? The hardcap is gone now, most mobs now hit too hard to allow anyone but a tank type to even THINK about accepting a few rounds of combat. Hp and ac on the plate classes has balloned back out to where it should be, with a healthy advantage over every other single class in the game. Noone can approach the hp or the ac of a warrior or knight, not even monks.  Ac MEANS something again, you guys have it, monks dont. No, I dont EVER want to take the tank slot in a group if there is a warrior or knight in the area with comparable or even slightly inferior gear to me. What I DO want is the return of the days when, while I couldnt take a hit like a plate class, I could take a hit well enough to fill the slot when there wasnt any plate class around to do so. <br />
<br />
One of the arguments floating around is, people will start taking monks for tanks in exp groups in non challenging areas. Yeah, im sure they will, but the thing is, any group who would choose a monk OVER a warrior or knight has some serious issues. Just because we COULD tank, doesnt mean we WOULD tank, and certainly not as well as a warrior. To put it in rl terms, when it comes to pure tanking power, monks would be the chevy s-10 of tanking, warriors would be the ford f-150. Sure the chevy will do in a pinch, but you would be far better off using the ford.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually that isn't the definition of snap aggro.  Snap aggro is being able to immediately generate enough aggro on contact that the mob is exceedingly unlikely to turn it's attention elsewhere.  Paladins have snap aggro using stuns.  Shadow Knights have snap aggro using fears and snares.  Warriors don't really have snap aggro per se, but they can establish aggro much better than before and as long as everyone is reasonably careful, maintain it.  Taunt doesn't generate snap aggro.  Taunt, when it's successful, and it's not all that successful, merely puts you at the top of the hate list for that round.  The very next series of attacks determines whether or not the Warrior stays at the top of the hate list or loses aggro control again.  This is not &quot;snap aggro&quot;.</div></div><hr />

If thats not snap agro, then nothing is. It doesnt matter wether it puts you 1 point or 10k points above the next guy on the list, you are still instantly raised above him. The ability to LOCK agro is something else entirely. Pre nerf I was able to hold agro off a level 50 paladin who was chain stunning his head off trying to take agro from me at 52.

<br />
One of the biggest problems with all that is the confusion among the players, cause SOE very efficiently muddied the waters.<br />
<br />
Its not just that they hide all the mitigation/avoidance numbers from us (EVERYTHING we know about AC comes from the players...), its that they basically reinvented the AC system that was known from the table tops.<br />
<br />
And more than that, they even combined two very different systems, and their variants, its really crazy from a seasoned gamers viewpoint.<br />
<br />
For one, we have different tables for each &quot;class&quot;, we take damage differently based on our &quot;armor class&quot;. That system is only rarely used, cause it basically sucks, but SOE made it even worse, by grouping completely unrelated classes together (warrior/bard or monk/druid).<br />
<br />
Second we have the &quot;AC system&quot;, very widespread and used by the majority of the games in two different ways. One way takes the AC number as a targeting modifier, effectively using it as avoidance (example: AD&amp;D), the other way uses the AC to reduce the damage taken after the hit occured (example: Shadowrun). The systems are generally mutually exclusive, but they have one thing in common: AC NEVER CHANGES. AC is short for Armor Class, its a system that assigns an artificial &quot;quality rating&quot; to a piece of armor. And that number is absolute, equal numbers of AC are equal.<br />
<br />
Its like that old trick question, what is heavier, a ton of iron, or a ton of feathers.<br />
<br />
The general suit of platemail protects better against damage than a piece of red linen, so it has a higher AC rating. Now enter magic. Its not just a piece of red linen, its the Loin Cloth of Dragonslaying, a piece of ordinary linen (there was nothing else at hand...) bathed in the blood of a dragon that sacrificed his own eternal life to power the cloths protective magic (to stop some demon from destroying the world, yada yada...  .<br />
<br />
While it still looks like a red loin cloth, its magic is powerful enuff to stop even a demons claws, thus it has a higher AC number. D&amp;D does that the cleanest, they simply add a magic modifier to the standard items. So, while its still only leather, a Leather+10 (extremely powerfull) is better protection than the general full plate suite.<br />
<br />
Bah, i'm rambling, the important thing is simply that an AC value can't change in worth, its an absolute scale, it has to be for the system to work.<br />
<br />
Imagine every country in the world using its own scales for weight, but the same titles, an english ton isn't the same as a french ton. That would kill business, it simply doesn't work.<br />
<br />
And now comes SOE.<br />
<br />
They really managed to put ALL these things into a completely new system, an abomination of a an AC system.<br />
<br />
They have avoidance AND mitigation AC, drawing it from skills, items, and modifiers, all combined in one meaningless number.<br />
<br />
And then they slapped the (botched from the base) armor class system on top of it.<br />
<br />
So now we have a bunch of numbers which say us nothing, and do different things for different people anyway.<br />
<br />
Take me for example, unbuffed i have exactly 1800 AC.<br />
<br />
But when comparing that numbers to another class, heck, even another monk, it says nothing.<br />
<br />
A big part of it comes from my defense skill. Another big part from my items AC. A smaller part from my monk class bonus. Another small part from my Avoidance mods. A smaller part from my Agility. If i were a lizzard i could list the race bonus here too. To make it really complicated, i could get some buffs.<br />
<br />
And in the end, this 1800 number means something completely else than 1800 for a warrior, or 1800 for a ranger.<br />
<br />
The AC system itself is utterly screwed, and the result is that a melee class, a class that traditionally is VERY good at melee, both offensive AND defensive, in every game that actually has that class (including prenerf EQ), is utterly screwed too.Pretty much sums up the whole &quot;plate vs chain vs leather vs silk&quot; thing for me.<br />
<br />
AC should be the determinant for a piece of armor's value.<br />
<br />
And if the AC on a piece is too high for a certain class, then that class shouldn't get it.<br />
<br />
Not this hodgepodge hocuspocus &quot;but that PSC is PLATE!!!&quot; Bullshit that we have now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There, sir, is your answer.  You cant draw the mitigation line at armor's basic ac values ... ie a 1900ac monk = 1900ac druid = 1900ac warrior ... Each class has it's own tables for this very reason.<br />
<br />
AC values are pretty standard straight across the board, but much more goes into how much dmg you take than simply what your ac count it.  These checks and balances also look at such things as comparative level to the hitter in question, class, and aa/focus enchancements.<br />
<br />
1900ac monk &gt; 1500ac monk .... for obvious reasons.<br />
<br />
1900ac monk &lt; 1500ac warrior for the very reason.  In the case of pure tank vs dps/utility ... the raw ac count is not sufficient to overcome the natural innate abilities of the wearer of the armor.  <br />
<br />
1900ac monk &gt; 1100ac warrior.  The raw ac count is sufficient to overcome the natural innate abilities of the warrior in this instance.<br />
<br />
If anything, i'd say that the system Sony came up with is better than anything that came before it in DD and the like.<br />
<br />
As has been posted already, monks have the 2nd lowest average Damage per round intake due to their increased avoidance.  Now you want your mitigation bar raised even further and everyone put on the same ac scale?<br />

We were fucked due to a no longer existant game mechanic ( AC HardCaps ) and lazy itemization ( &quot;Hey, items are in the DB using an integer and we're running out of room... should we convert to Long?

<br />
So they fucked us.<br />
<br />
My personal theory is they did something innate to our DI, kind of opposite of the Warrior adjustment, but that was too much, so they rolled it back somewhat and gave us a ridiculously harsh return after softcap.<br />
<br />
Then Warriors got DI-1 and Incite and Improvements to Taunt and Gear with meaningful AC/HP differences.<br />
<br />
And Mobs started hitting like Trucks, to the extent that all being an &quot;avoidance tank&quot; meant was that killing spikes would simply hit with almost clockwork regularity.<br />

High mitigation is a primary trait of Tank classes. Monks aren't tanks. Therefor it is illogical to ask for tank-like mitigation on a non-tank class.Monks may not be Tanks any more, but if we weren't Tanks at one time, how did we ever out-tank Warriors?<br />
<br />
Each class had a different HardCap.<br />
<br />
Apparently a Monk at the Monk HardCap was &quot;supposed&quot; to mitigate identically as a Warrior at the Warrior HardCap.<br />
<br />
It was just &quot;supposed&quot; to be a hell of a lot harder for us to reach that HardCap than it was.<br />
<br />
We were &quot;supposed&quot; to be soloers, and with our range options, that certainly implies at least a viable tanking role to me.<br />
<br />
In any case, what we're &quot;supposed&quot; to be or do is totally a matter of opinion and it's fairly obvious to me that neither side will ever convince the other of anything better than meaningless tokens of acknowledgement on certain points at best.<br />
<br />
In short, I'd simply like AC to mean AC for all classes ( except Warriors who fucking deserve that DI-1 bonus /props ) and let our skill caps determine how well we use a particular piece of armor and let the items have the &quot;correct&quot; values assigned to them.<br />
<br />
But perhaps the only thing SoE has ever been consistent on is their complete horror at the idea of actually going through the item database with anything approaching the kind of exacting thoroughness that that would require.<br />
<br />
Of course their also have to be a complete overhaul to the skill cap system, which SoE has consistently indicated would require the installation of heaters in Hell before it could even be considered.apolyon <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u135"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p135">&quot;Excuse me, but I made no mention of PoTime gear. Avoidance is what Monks at all levels use, you know Parry, Block, and Dodge. &quot;<br />
<br />
You mentioned Thep's parses which show monks doing the superior damage over time thing. Unfortunately, the monk that does this is Thep himself. With all the +AVOIDANCE gear from PoTime. Go, check out Thep's parses. The 1036 AC monk, who has no PoTime gear, has very different statistics.<br />
<br />
You all have Thep's post archived. And love to quote bits and pieces of it. Go ... check out his parse. Notice what's making the LARGEST impact in monk avoidance.<br />
<br />
It isn't Dodge. Monks and warriors both have dodge. It isn't the block/parry difference. That was well parsed out long before Thep did this test. Block doesn't fire much. Parry really doesn't happen all that often.<br />
<br />
The avoidance superiority you, and a few others are pointing to, when you point to Thep's parse comes from  Thep's Plane of Time loot.<br />
<br />
SOME OF WHICH, is Warrior usable, btw.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
ANYWAYS ... I'm not twisting anything you said Glatius. The monk avoidance superiority comes from gear.  High level, GoD gear. Or high level PoTime gear.<br />
<br />
As a warrior, I'd have expected some of you to be a bit more sensitive to that. But, eh, who cares right? I mean, it's not like I read on these forums hundreds of times how annoyed you all were having to get to AoW or BEYOND to get enraging blow ... JUST so a warrior could do their job.<br />
<br />
Nah. I never read that.<br />
<br />
It's not like I read dozens and dozens of times how warriors tricked out with enraging blow weapons would argue with the rest of you saying &quot;everything's fine.&quot; Nah. Never read that.<br />
<br />
It's not like, back in Luclin, the HANDFUL of warriors with Bloodfrenzy and Hategiver combo could tank and hold aggro exceptionally well. So much so, that, aggro wasn't an issue for them ... but was an issue for the majority of Frostbringer using &quot;masses.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nah. I dreamed all of that.<br />
<br />
:p<br />
<br />
But thanks for letting the monk community know that as long as they can get +60 AVOIDANCE from PoTime or Gates of Discord, they'll be just fine as &quot;tanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
That's really very nice of you.</div></div><hr />

Just exactly what is the innate avoidance advantage that a Monk has over a Warrior?<br />
<br />
I believe we have the same Riposte, higher Dodge, and that Block is more effective than Parry.<br />
<br />
How does that all add up before we get avoidance gear and you all get shielding  ( assume max defensive AAs for both classes, even though that choice isn't as cut and dried for us since we're not &quot;supposed&quot; to get hit at all anyway :p )?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u142"><b>Girthyboy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p142">I just don't get why some people have to be such whiny bitches about it.<br />
<br />
I don't even want to try to argue that all tanks will still outtank monks, cause ya'll are ignorant about it.<br />
Think about it -- back then we had the same ac AND that ac meant something for monks.  Now, high end tanks have like 2.3 or 2.4k AC and the HIGHEST monks have like 1900 maybe -- not to mention that our softcap makes most of that 1900 useless.  The way it is now, a monk with 4000 AC would not tank as well as a war with 2400.  <br />
Also, i believe a monk with 60 Avoiddance on gear is parsed to show that he gets hit about 6% less.  Compare that with warriors who have around 20-30% shielding and i'd rather have shielding.  <br />
<br />
The most obvious thing to me though is the reason for the nerf.  It was their itemization that allowed monks to have the same AC, and now that is a non issue.  We no longer have an AC even remotely close to the average warrior.  Tanks in my guild have 500-600 more AC than me and it means something unlike my 1500-1550 which is already over the softcap by around 150.  We are still nerfed with mitigation and a softcap and the AC itemization was fixed...why are we still being punished for their fuck ups?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u143"><b>Sin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p143">Monks whining about Knights having spellbooks now? LOL.  It's pretty obvious you all want to tank, well boo fucking hoo those spots are filled.

I am thinking they would completely loose it.<br />
<br />
The tanking dept is full, take your applications to the increased DPS and pulling utility dept.   Just who are you trying to convince here?  Warriors, as you can see they want no part of any of your suggestions beyond maybe the slightest increase in mitigation, they support anything pretty much that would help you in your role, pulling or increase in DPS. I hope some Knights get a hold of your amazing ideas that you should tank as well as them.  Quit living in the past and try an improve on the role you have, by trying to take away from 3+ other classes your not going to get anything but people pissed off.</div></div><hr />

Monks still have access to that gear that made the problem in the first place. The problem gear has not been removed. Hell, I'd submit an opinion that its even more available than it was. Tell how a monk at 1300 AC isn't going to out-tank a 1300 AC warrior. Both level commonly reachable by both classes at the same level of progression.<br />
<br />
I agree, they should just reitemize, remove the class softcaps, and make AC a absolute just like hps. I've mentioned this several times here at TSW as have many before me. However, SOE has gone to great lengths to avoid doing that very thing. They absolutely horrify at the thought of reitemizing the database. This is the WHOLE reason why they nerfed class AC softcaps. As more people of every class started to approach the hardcap, which warriors reached first. The more people realized the could tank just as effectively as a warrior. Since warriors don't bring much else to the table, they got to sit /lfg. Itemization and hardcaps undermined the defining trait of a warrior and the other tanks. Then SOE decided to introduce more mobs that could one round a player, further strengthening the group desirablity or primary tanks, so as to insure a group role for these classes. This is a gameplay decision, and one that they have been following ever since. They chose their path, the planned ahead to ensure the gameplay element that they wanted in thier game and implemented them as such.<br />
<br />
I don't agree, but nevertheless, that's what they did. it water under the bridge now. Monks should see it as such and let it go. SOE is not going to repeal the nerf. And given the past record, I'm pretty sure hell will freeze over before they reitemize the database.<br />
<br />
If I had my way, they reitemize armor. Each type of armor would be able to attain the same level of AC in a particular tier. Say all kael chestpieces have 50 AC. Then each class would have multiplier based on thier archetype. Tanks have the highest, skirts would have the lowest. You could always tell the tier an item came from just by the level of AC that is on it. Each class then has a set tier that each item flass into. Thier would be no softcaps. Say casters have a muliplier of 1 and for tanks its 2. Both wear the same tier BP at 50 AC. Equiping the BP would give 50*1 AC to the caster, whereas, it would show as 100 for the tank. The caster would then have to attain twice as much raw AC to equal the AC of the tank, but if the caster did do that, he would mitigate exactly the same as the tank with the same amount of worn AC. Defense skills would then further differentiate classes in a given archetype. With equal AC, warriors would mitigate better than knights at the same level of worn AC by virtue of higher defense skills. Skills that would show that difference in the worn AC number.</div></div><hr />

Xainn, I won't comment on Paladins as I'm not a Paladin, but SK's defensive spell while tanking is Aura of Pain, which is a self AC tap.  Lifetaps, while powerful in normal ldons and such, serve little meaning in Gates.  Lifetaps do not scale like stuns can. ToI is a 470tap in EC and a 470tap in Tacvi, not to mention healing =/= mitigation/avoidance.  As far as ATK debuffs, these stop at level 54. Very few (I'm one of the few) Shadowknights memorize this spell over Aura of Hate.  This is because this spell [54 ATK tap] is a bitch to land and provides fewer ATK.</div></div><hr />

They both say the same thing. Explicitly restating the subject, although useful for clarification in legal documents, isn't really neccessary in day to day conversation. I'm sure my statements could have been worded better, but I wasn't aware that perfect grammer was a requirement for discussion here.<br />
<br />
On your second point, I'm not sure what point you're trying to get across. Mudflation is a central theme regarding the mitigatrion nerf. Inflation caused different classes to hit the hardcap and make warrior mitigation a moot point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u159"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p159">ooo you crack me up.<br />
<br />
first off, go... Fuck... yourself..., is not a insult as it is a get lost statment.<br />
<br />
So first of you're wrong it's not a insult, but it is a inflamming statment.<br />
<br />
You're a retarded kid that makes down syndrome kids look bright, is a insult (no insulte to down syndome kids)<br />
<br />
avoidance means jack when the mob has a high enough atk. <br />
<br />
Actually high attack makes mitigation worse and worse....<br />
<br />
Did you mean high accuracy?<br />
<br />
Cause attack doesn't affect hit % only how much you get hit for when hit...<br />
<br />
I've clearly explained this on MB also, (you know those posts of mine you like to comb through)<br />
<br />
Like i said my friend, even if ac=ac we still have a soft cap at 1350. <br />
<br />
Ah so where's the mystical 1350? if you want to try and sound authoritative and you're making up numbers, it's not going to work.  1350 probably is about right but no one has the exact number. <br />
<br />
And i know your going to come back with a monk with 1300 ac should not mitigate as well as a warrior with 1300, well guess what, we won't. You have an inate 5% remember? <br />
<br />
That's not really a honest statment the random mitigation part based on ac will still be the same and it's not techincally 5%.  At the most it's 5% and it's a straight reduction of damage.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, over the course of two hours. I already explained how the length of the parse seriously skews results for monks. Now, even if that WAS the case, which it isnt, monks would still have to deal with a much lower hp, higher damage average per hit due to having a near 700 point ac gap at the highest level, and no ability to lock agro right off the bat. Of course, the fact that you are wrong and that even if our 1900 ac counted as 1900 ac for knights, we STILL wouldnt take a hit as well as a comperably equipped plate class over a real fight. Would monks be ABLE to tank? Duh, Would they be preffered? Hell no. Its obvious to anyone willing to look at it objectively.

I'm sure not inclinded to provide parses to support the validity of the Monk mitigation nerf, because I don't need to.  It's there.

You dont need to match or exceed in the 3 catergories, you merely need to be sufficient. This is the point you are missing.<br />
<br />
Does a warrior need a DBotW to tank PoV? No. Does it help, yes. With higher dps, initial pull aggro, and procs monks are positioned to tank in many grps outside of the uber content where the mitigation improvement would really help. Do monks face a more challenging tank environment lacking taunt, incite, ecetera, yes. But you could also function as puller and tank (in the revised mitigation scenario) freeing up a spot in many grps.<br />
<br />
In the end this argument remains if you want to pull better and do better dps ask for that. Mitigation is not the answer to these two things. Better stun resistance or even potentially backside mitigation along with better dps is.<br />

Being sufficient isnt the same as being preffered. I fully admit that with the nerf and softcap removed that monks will be able to tank again. What I DO deny is that people will EVER choose monks over warriors or knights just because they CAN tank. That is the point you keep glossing over. You see that monks will be able to tank again and you immeadiately jump to the conclusion that monks will be replacing you in groups as main tank when all we will become is a viable alternative if there arent any plate tanks around.</div></div><hr />

That gear does still exist. The problems that that gear caused do NOT exist anymore, because that gear is dated.<br />

There exists tradable elemental plane armor that tanks can get that will make NToV stuff look like crap. There exists easy to acquire Kizrak's junk that warriors can acquire that makes end-game NToV and some of that Ssraa crap monks were sporting look like crap.<br />

Earlier in this thread, a monk suggested that monks should be &quot;equal but different&quot; to warriors (something most warriors do not agree with).

Number one i don't give any credit to that parse. Number two the only way to parse a monk against a high enough mob to prove our point would only be a 30 sec fight, why? cos we'd die. or we get a heal and the mob goes to cleric and that ruins the parse. The mobs we are talking about would kill a monk in less than 30sec. This if from a guy who just yesterday when ld near the hobos in PoN and came back in right next to one. before i was even able to enter a command i was dead.

After pressing ID it takes on average 7 sec to land, how long does it take taunt? not even sure on the refreash i don't use it that much, maybe 10sec. Taunt lands imediatly and i don't know the refreash rate. How does this help the caster that is getting beat on?</div></div><hr />

Im sure there is a bottom, after all, the average damage wont drop forever, but its not like a monk STARTS at taking that kind of damage a second either. Its like demanding extra parses to prove that warriors will mitigate more  damage over knights. Its not needed because its obvious. *EDIT* And yes Liper, removing the nerf would still be removing the nerf if thats all they alter.

<br />
Pumilo, you've mentioned this garbage more than a few times over the past week or so. Why? Do you ever bother to pay attention to Everquest? How much time passed between these two changes:<br />
<br />
- Necromancers had their DoTs &quot;nerfed&quot; so that multiple necros couldn't stack the same DoTs on the same mobs. Thus nerfing their damage and keeping them in check.<br />
<br />
YEARS LATER ...<br />
<br />
- Necromancers, in an effort to give them more raid utility beyond mana battery, were boosted by having this &quot;nerf&quot; removed. Multiple necros can now stack the same DoTs on the same mobs at raids.<br />
<br />
This is just one of a handful of examples people can provide detailing how, even YEARS later, &quot;nerfs&quot; can be &quot;removed&quot; from the game. <br />
<br />
Anyways ...<br />
<br />
Regarding Instill Doubt ...<br />
<br />
It's one of the few things I, Wubao, have ever tested. It didn't test very well in regards to aggro generation. It's certainly not &quot;snap&quot; aggro. It's certainly not as powerful as incite. It certainly is a horrible aggro tool. Most monks have had SIMILAR experiences with it, when trying to tank. Listening to some SK's and some warriors tell us this is a great aggro tool is entertaining, for sure. But not really anywhere close to how the skill works.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, I must thank you all for trying to make that argument. The NEXT time a Bard drops by Monkly Biz, claiming they have no aggro generation, it will certainly be entertaining to point out that they DO. That warriors proved ages ago that instill doubt is great for aggro. And then link them here.</div></div><hr />

If I had my way, they reitemize armor. Each type of armor would be able to attain the same level of AC in a particular tier. Say all kael chestpieces have 50 AC. Then each class would have multiplier based on thier archetype. Tanks have the highest, skirts would have the lowest. You could always tell the tier an item came from just by the level of AC that is on it. Each class then has a set tier that each item flass into. Thier would be no softcaps. Say casters have a muliplier of 1 and for tanks its 2. Both wear the same tier BP at 50 AC. Equiping the BP would give 50*1 AC to the caster, whereas, it would show as 100 for the tank. The caster would then have to attain twice as much raw AC to equal the AC of the tank, but if the caster did do that, he would mitigate exactly the same as the tank with the same amount of worn AC. Defense skills would then further differentiate classes in a given archetype. With equal AC, warriors would mitigate better than knights at the same level of worn AC by virtue of higher defense skills. Skills that would show that difference in the worn AC number./agree /bow<br />
<br />
Throw in some consistent numbers representing &quot;Mitigation AC&quot; and &quot;Avoidance AC&quot; and I'm right with you.<br />
<br />
The &quot;mystery&quot; of the combat engine is simply no longer entertaining, if it ever was in the first place.Pumilio<br />
<br />
Your &quot;better monks&quot; &quot;destroyed&quot; my arguments?<br />
<br />
oh you mean how monks would be better served by higher avoidance?<br />
oh yeah, that was destroyed by examples that affect tanking.<br />
<br />
Or you must mean when I said that monks should mitigate better then druids but not better then chain and have avoidance improved also...<br />
<br />
yeap destroyed because monks THINK they can magically get rid of how EQ ranks balance for thier class (guess what it's NOT tanking then dps then utility)<br />
<br />
Or you mean when monks said they would be UNABLE to tank because of no snap aggro and how undesirable thier added dps would be because of aggro... and I called bullshit...<br />
<br />
Oh that's right it was proven wrong by overrating the use of taunt in regular exp groups, and how not necessary it is.<br />
<br />
So what got destoryed?Check the title of this very thread, fucktard.<br />
<br />
monks think mitigation &gt; avoidance.<br />
<br />
As Laotzu Qigong showed you, if you bothered to read it, for a Pulling Class, mitigation has a far greater value than avoidance.<br />
<br />
All a Puller is concerned about is &quot;avoiding&quot; the Guaranteed Death Spikes.<br />
<br />
Mitigation is all about lowered spike rates.<br />
<br />
As a puller, I could give two shits about &quot;Damage over Time&quot;.<br />
<br />
I care about getting the damn mob back to the Real Tank without needing Necro CoH.<br />
<br />
But I forgot...<br />

This is actually really a conspiracy amongst all Monks to displace Warriors as Tanks, just like we did in CT, isn't it Liper.<br />
<br />
You pathetic shit.Pumilio<br />
<br />
Quote:<br />
A 1900ac monk is the top 1% of any server, even if ac=ac there would still be the soft cap. so a Monk woudl not be a better tank than a knight. Not to mention the top 1% of Knights is what? much higher ac? i don't know. You also leave out agro and all that but we've tried to reason this point to you as best we could.  <br />
<br />
<br />
This is where your argument gets destoryed. making your ac mean the same as a plates, you have the exact same damage per swing as a superior warrior...First of all, it's destroyed, moron.<br />

Isn't there ANYTHING else that makes a Tank?  ANYTHING at all?<br />
<br />
Like, I dunno...<br />
<br />
How you minimize the affect of the inevitable spikes via AC mitigation, direct DI bonus, or even simply having a larger damn HP Pool with which to absorb those spikes?<br />
<br />
Or how about aggro, your ability to get it and your ability to hold it.<br />
<br />
If the mere possibility of us having a &quot;Damage over Time&quot; rating better than a Tanks ( yeah, yeah, HERESY, I know ) gets you to frothing this way, then make it absolutely useless for us to have it.<br />
<br />
Make it such that we generate only half as much aggro as any other class, no matter what we do.  Our DPS, our Procs, hell, even our very existence.<br />
<br />
What fucking good would the ability to take half ( hyperbole alert ) the &quot;damage over time&quot; of any warrior do us, if we could never ever ever convince the mob to hit us instead of someone else?  ( well, honestly, we could prolly solo some insane shit, I guess, but even then, we're certainly not taking any MT group slots, are we ).Pumilio<br />

Xainn, I won't comment on Paladins as I'm not a Paladin, but SK's defensive spell while tanking is Aura of Pain, which is a self AC tap. Lifetaps, while powerful in normal ldons and such, serve little meaning in Gates. Lifetaps do not scale like stuns can. ToI is a 470tap in EC and a 470tap in Tacvi, not to mention healing =/= mitigation/avoidance. As far as ATK debuffs, these stop at level 54. Very few (I'm one of the few) Shadowknights memorize this spell over Aura of Hate. This is because this spell [54 ATK tap] is a bitch to land and provides fewer ATK.Thank you for the insight.<br />

Has anyone ever compared the Damage over Time rates of a Top End Knight using all the tools he has access to while Tanking to a Top End Warrior using all the tools he has?<br />
<br />
I see some melee only comparisons, but I guess I'm looking for a kind of &quot;This is EVERYTHING they had&quot; type comparison.<br />

I think you are exaggerating. According to here, ID has a success rate of 30-35%. According to here, Taunt has a success rate of 31%.You're going to seriously compare an anecdotal account from a post on Allakhazam in a thread about a piece of gear that drops in Grieg's to a parse by Paen?<br />
<br />
And then you're going to look only at the portion of Paen's parse where he's using Taunt on a Level 68 Kyv to establish your percentage for comparison?<br />
<br />
You may have a case, I guess.<br />
<br />
On level 68 mobs, if Taunt only works 31% of the time, ID may actually successfully fire more often.<br />
<br />
Too bad, then, that at best ID is merely a straight add to aggro ( resisted fear, I'd guess ) as opposed to a possible jump immediately to the top of the Hate list.<br />
<br />
If it were, Pinky and I could take over the Tanking world....<br />
<br />
God I wish I knew what the recycle of ID was compared to Taunt, as well.  But I don't.  /shrug<br />

My point was That relying on ID for &quot;Snap Aggro&quot; is worse than relying on only Taunt.<br />

If you ask me, &quot;2nd lowest average Damage per Round and 2nd highest average damage per hit&quot; already sounds like &quot;equal but different&quot;.That Monk was me :)<br />
<br />
I'm curious, though how the following two statements sound &quot;equal but different&quot; with reqards to overall melee survivability ( which was the context in which I made that statement ):<br />
<br />
Monks - &quot;2nd lowest average Damage per Round and 2nd highest average damage per hit&quot;<br />
<br />
Warriors - &quot;Lowest average Damage per Round and Lowest average damage per hit&quot;<br />
<br />
For further context of the &quot;Equal but different&quot; melee survivability, my question was &quot;Why shouldn't monks have every bit of melee survivability as the Tanks do, given that we have a much harder time doing anything with it besides pulling&quot;.Pumilio<br />
<br />
It's been around so long it's not &quot;removing&quot; you'd simply be adding in more mitigation to the monk class.Okay, you semantic twat...<br />
<br />
How about:<br />
<br />
&quot;Removing an unnecessary and unfair penalty to Monk mitigation which cripples a class which has no reasonable alternative to melee combat and further which never should have happened in the first place because the problems weren't with the Monk Class but rather with the prior implementation of the AC Hardcap, which has since been replaced with an AC Softcap, and a remarkable lack of foresight when creating gear between 4 and 5 expansions ago.&quot;<br />

This is one piece of information you do not want to ask for on these boards :).  Believe it or not, All classes are bias and generally unreasonable when arguing over class balance.  This is just something you have to accept and try to overcome.  On this thread alone, you have monks saying they mitigate worse than a druid.  Monks are using Average Hit, which does not even factor their avoidance supremecy.  Not to mention, there is no factoring of Melee-Immunity Disciplines or Mitigation Disciplines when monks discuss &quot;Mitigation&quot;.  Not to mention, there are Warriors claiming monk aggro is sufficent for tanking in Gates.  The dime in your hand looks like a nickel to you and a quarter to the far away stranger.</div></div><hr />

Different situations will favor different results.  In Vxed, a paladin will be taking a fraction of the damage a warrior will take whereas in Qvic, a paladin will be left in the dust.  Its different classes and the like, wanting to be balanced or near balanced to another class in all aspects defeats the purpose of classes in general. Not to mention that anyone can manipulate facts to support themselves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The goal of balance should never be to make all classes equal.<br />
<br />
It should be to make each class equally fun to play for those that choose it.<br />
<br />
There should never be an invalid choice.  Some should be &quot;better&quot; than others as the class definition should lend itself to a certain style or styles of play.  For example, a tanking chanter should be remarkably difficult to pull off...<br />
<br />
But a choice should never ever be invalidated, unless the entire game would fall apart otherwise.  Specifically, I was thinking they should have bitten the bullet and fixed the Hardcap and the Gear instead of screwing the Monk.<br />
<br />
Because if you're letting potentially game breaking choices in, then you have bigger problems than class balance, IMO.<br />

<br />
&quot;&quot;IF, and this is a big IF, the mitiagtion nerf was removed today, explain to me how the nerf wouldn't totally fuck over mid level and early 65 tanks.&quot;&quot; <br />
<br />
You are saying if the nerf was removed ... how would the nerf totally fuck over 65 tanks? WHAT nerf? It's REMOVED! If it's REMOVED ... how can it fuck over anyone?<br />
<br />
In regards to my second point ... the gear that the monk mitigation penalty was instituted for, is primarily NToV and Luclin era gear.<br />
<br />
That gear does still exist. The problems that that gear caused do NOT exist anymore, because that gear is dated.<br />
<br />
There exists tradable elemental plane armor that tanks can get that will make NToV stuff look like crap. There exists easy to acquire Kizrak's junk that warriors can acquire that makes end-game NToV and some of that Ssraa crap monks were sporting look like crap.<br />
<br />
When the bazaar starts to provide tradable gear to mid-level warriors that out-does the end-game raiding gear that caused a gear imbalance ... then MUDFLATION has done its part in balancing the scales.<br />
<br />
Ah, ok, I get it. The answer is that it would once again make monks a viable tanks compared to mid level - early 65 warriors, because at that point the problem monk gear is still very much comparable to warrior gear. When I said &quot;the nerf&quot; I meant the nerf's removal, I could also have said &quot;that&quot; just as well.<br />
<br />
I see what you are saying about mudflation, but I deagree. That era's gear is still not behind bazaar gear totally. maybe one or two expansions will change that. I imagine either the monk class will be dead by that time or SOE wil have to repeal the nerf, because gimping a melee class to such low effective AC would be crippling.<br />
<br />
I'm a bit slow, but I think I've realized what the monks here have been trying to say, but haven't clear articulated yet. So allow me if you will:<br />
<br />
Monks don't think avoidance is very valuable without meaningful AC simply because of the way avoidance works. Its an all or nothing deal, except in a much more painful way than warriors experience it.<br />
<br />
When a warrior is in combat, attacks can effectively be a miss, or one of 19 different values from the mobs standard attack. They avoid fairly well, but when they get hit, they have a distributed range of values they can be hit for. By maximizing AC, they can move the probability of a max hit lower in a predictable way.<br />
<br />
Monks, because of their low AC either get missed or hit for max damage. It's a binary function. Instead of having a dependable system in place to protect them when avoidance fails they have a system setup to essentially give only 2 values out in combat: miss or max. They effectively have only one defensive avenue.<br />
<br />
Lets look back at warriors and suppose for a minute that there were only 3 combat states: miss, min, or max. Avoidance all the same, they get hit the same amount over time as they normally do. AC as well continues to function the same way and reduces the chance to be hit for max at the same rate. However, since instead of 19 hit values we only have 2 min and max, the short term effect is much more profound. Its easy to see that such a change would not be preferable. In either of the two systems you could have a situation in which the average hit was for 500 damage. However, in the binary system it is likely for you to get hit for max 50% of the time than a system that would otherwise allow you to get hit for near 500 most of the time instead, which is much more manageable. Mitigation functions this way, but avoidance due to its binary nature provides no significant real-time advantages. it's effects are only seen in the long term, whereas, mitigation allows for some more immediate benefit.<br />
<br />
In short, warriors would be outraged and the game very nearly unplayable if combat hit had only min and max values. This is effectively what the monks face today. This is because average over time doesn't matter is the time is limited, like a combat encounter. I had this discussion in DAoC about why blunt  and large weapons were so much more powerful than other weapons. DAoC has a DPS system to rate its weapons. Weapons have different delays, but no matter how fast or slow, the weapon would alway produce that DPS over time. Short delays had that damage come in smaller chunks than Large weapons and blunt weapons. mobs and players have limited hitpoints. Since the begining attack has no delay, effectively the first stike of a slow weapon vs a fast weapon, the slow weapon has an initial DPS lead on the fast weapons, since it already delieved its &quot;chunk&quot; or damage calaculated by deviding its delay into the DPS. The longer the combat, they more hitpoints a player/mob had, the closer the 2 different delay came togather until they exacly matched each other. But for those first few swings, which most combat only consisted of a few attacks, the slower weapon sometimes had an effective DPS of over twice that of a faster weapon. Those chunks evened out over time, but that was irrelevent because time wasn't unlimited. This is essentially the same issue from DAoC iterated in EQ.<br />
<br />
I haven't yet formed an opinion on what to do about monk mitigation though.</div></div><hr />

For named that can be killed in 24 seconds or less, yes rangers are better tanks than warriors.  Last time I checked, there weren't many named or bosses that can be killed that fast by a single group.  The only mobs that are going to 1 round a tank are named.  Yes, those could probably 1 round a monk.  They could 1 round a wizard too.  Neither of them are tanks so that's as it should be.<br />
<br />
Trash mobs can't 1 round a monk in appropriate gear anymore than they can a warrior so the only thing that matters is average damage over time.  If you're fighting stuff that can 1 round you, a monk should not be capable of tanking it.  That's what tanks specialize in.  By the same token closely grouped mobs with large aggro radii are not splittable by a warrior but are by a monk.  That's a monk specialty.</div></div><hr />

What the people who bitch loudly about all those &quot;spikes in damage&quot; that monks take where they die from so many hits landing in a row are forgetting, or perhaps they choose not to mention, is that for every spike in damage, there's a corresponding spike in not taking any damage.Interesting...<br />
<br />
So what happens as the Damage Spikes grow larger?  Do the &quot;Avoidance Spikes&quot; grow larger as well?  Do I suddenly get missed for less than zero?<br />
<br />
If you're comparing Damage spike frequency with Avoidance spike frequency, fine.  In a Damage over Time comparison, those would match, one assumes.<br />
<br />
But if you're measuring survivability over time, how does 10% ( made up number ) of the spikes being large enough to kill you out right compare to a mob with a lower max hit that might only get a 3% chance of one rounding us?<br />
<br />
It's not just a matter of getting hit harder, it's a matter of getting spiked hard enough to kill, with all to much frequency.<br />
<br />
And as the spikes grow larger and larger, the percentage of them than can kill us also grows higher and higher, while the percentage of them that miss us doesn't change at all.<br />
<br />
Damage over time might stay the say, but &quot;dead time&quot; increases dramatically.After all, the avoidance difference between monks and warriors is a TEN PERCENT difference in number of hits landed on a monk that didn't land on a warrior.Assuming you're referring to Thepp's parse...  <br />
<br />
And assuming you're looking at the top Monk numbers compared to the top Warrior numbers...<br />
<br />
How much of that TEN PERCENT do you suppose is due to the 60 Avoidance mod that the Monk has compared to the 0 Avoidance mods that the Warrior has?<br />
<br />
Please don't equate the gear and the class.Vikken<br />

We take a higher average hit than a comparably equipped Druid.<br />
<br />
Does having a lower damage over time justify that?<br />
<br />
Perhaps, but it doesn't sit well that a tree hugger when hit gets hit on average harder than we do when we get hit, even if we DO get hit significantly less often.Groovdog<br />
<br />
You just made a case for knights as well if you truly believe this, as warriors are the best overall tank in many situations.But there are sufficient situations where a Knight is the best, right?<br />
<br />
Situations where the extreme level of mitigation that Warriors enjoy simply isn't necessary.<br />
<br />
Situations where the improved DPS that the Knight will allow his group to do because of early guaranteed aggro lock is enough of a compensation.<br />
<br />
What kinds of situations would an UnNerf'd Monk be the &quot;preferred&quot; Tank in?<br />
<br />
Little Aggro control ( even if we can maintain it, establishing it firmly is a hit or miss and establishing it early is pretty unlikely )<br />
Smaller HP pool<br />
Same mitigation as a Knight ( AC point for AC point ) but with significantly less AC<br />
No snap aggro ( still think ID is a joke, personally )<br />
Better Frontal DPS<br />
Roughly same damage over time characteristics as a comparably equipped Warrior.<br />
<br />
What group in what grouping situation would &quot;prefer&quot; that Monk over a &quot;Real Tank&quot;?<br />
<br />
Not any group I'm in, I'll tell you that much.<br />
<br />
But at least I'd be able to do something besides pick my ass while waiting for the Real Tank to take over so I can go pull.If monks could tank reasonably well then they would be taken because they can pull as well, something warriors (knights benefit here) can not do effectively. Would your grp sit waiting for a tank if a monk was available and could get the job done? Nope. Enuff said. Grpability down, therefore no support from the plate tanks.Keeping in mind that there is still a huge difference between &quot;tanking reasonably well&quot; and being viable at it...<br />
<br />
And that Damage over Time increases viability, but not necessarily desirability, IMO...<br />
<br />
No, that group wouldn't sit waiting.<br />
<br />
They'd let the monk tank until a Real Tank showed up.<br />
<br />
And if they were full when the Real Tank showed up...<br />
<br />
Then fuck the Real Tank, because no class deserves to make 5 other people sit on their ass until they decide to show up.<br />
<br />

How did you like being forced to wait for Monks when we were the only pullers in the game?Khumak<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter if you take more damage per hit than another class if your avoidance reduces your damage per unit of time enough to compensate. They could nerf warrior avoidance to where we get hit 100% of the time and I wouldn't care as long as they increased our mitigation enough that the average damage I take over time is the same.Really...<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter...<br />
<br />
How bout this, Khumak...<br />
<br />
Let's say they nerfed Warrior Mitigation down to the point where you got hit for Max every single time you got hit...<br />
<br />
At the same time, they increase Warrior Avoidance such that you only get hit one time in 10.<br />
<br />
In this new system, you'd be taking MUCH less damage over time.<br />
<br />
So you'd be better better off, right?<br />
<br />
I mean aside for the virtual guarantee that you'd eventually be guaranteed of being one rounded, right?<br />
<br />
Damage over Time is not nearly so important as the manner in which that damage is delivered when the delivery can kill you instantly.<br />
<br />
Damage over Time is only important when you actually have Time to deal with it.Trash mobs can't 1 round a monk in appropriate gear anymore than they can a warrior so the only thing that matters is average damage over time. If you're fighting stuff that can 1 round you, a monk should not be capable of tanking it. That's what tanks specialize in. By the same token closely grouped mobs with large aggro radii are not splittable by a warrior but are by a monk. That's a monk specialty.How many trash mobs would it take to one round a Monk in &quot;appropriate&quot; gear, Khumak?<br />
<br />
2?  3?  4?  10?<br />
<br />
See, cause before we split them and deliver them to you in nice bite sized chunks, we're facing that many or more.<br />
<br />
So how many mobs should it take to one round a Monk in &quot;appropriate&quot; gear?</div></div><hr />

<br />

The only forms of mitigation that warriors get that prevent us from being 1 rounded are shielding and defensive.  Defensive is warrior only and shielding is available to all classes.<br />

<br />
If we're talking about mobs that are challenging for a warrior to tank, then 1.  If we're not then you already have no problems tanking them.  Monks have discs to reduce damage over short periods of time while pulling or tanking in emergencies.<br />
<br />
As I said before, if you're unhappy with the spikes you get hit for now then you should be lobbying to get your avoidance nerfed such that any mitigation gain remains neutral from a damage over time perspective.  I don't think anyone would object to that.  <br />
<br />
If you want your mitigation increased without an avoidance nerf then you aren't after balance, you're after dominance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does having a lower damage over time justify that?<br />
The developers obviously think so.  They redesigned the monk to be this way deliberately.<br />
<br />
As an aside, I keep seeing it said that &quot;mitigation is more reliable than avoidance&quot;, or &quot;you can't count on avoidance but you can count on mitigation&quot;.  This statement bothers me quite a bit.  Maximum rounds are still possible no matter how high your mitigation is.  If you can be one-rounded with high avoidance, then you can be one-rounded with high mitigation.  Even with better mitigation, the fact will still remain that monks CAN be one-rounded, and eventually WILL be one-rounded if they try to tank for long enough, due to their being a low-hit-point class.  If you're fighting mobs that can one-round you, then is a slight improvement to mitigation really the answer to your death rate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u203"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p203">Uh, yeah and paladins can buff and group heal and shadow knights can pet pull and fd almost as well as monks can, whats your point?  No, a group wouldnt sit around waiting for a tank to show up, thats the point. But if there WAS a tank nearby, hey, lets get him! No group with any real intelligence will say, &quot;Hey, I realize there is a warrior/sk/pally lfg, but we already have a monk so there is no need!&quot; &quot;They will instead say, &quot;Oh good, we have a REAL tank now, ok monkey, go back to just pulling and attacking the ass end of the mob.&quot;<br />
Let's see, point by point:<br />
1) kind of hard to grp heal as MT getting hit by a GoD type mob, especially if slow is mitigated and immune and or hasnt been cast. Between fizzle, stuns, etc. the pally heals are really most useful in a non-MT role or for in-between patch healing. Also grp heal is not necessarily essential in most grps if the tank holds aggro. Buffs you mean BSS, ok grant you that but you can bumm that and or get it in PoK/PoT as well :)<br />
2) SK, pet pull works up to a point not including most high-end  content. Funny I watched a SK try to pet-pull a VT yellow con mob the other day and failed 5 straight times. Couldnt take the damage, even fully buffed, from the flurries he was getting. If SK FDs almost as well as monk that sounds like an issue that can be addressed without mitigation, imagine that.<br />
3) You might be different but if a monk could pull and MT, I would take that person over a plate tank cause then I could get more dps, more healing, etc. Instead of a pally (tank) and a monk(pull), i could have a monk(pull/tank) and a druid (heal/dps). More dps, more healing all in one package. Would I wait for a monk, not necessarily but I sure as hell wouldnt think twice about not getting a plate tank vs today where for most full-grp moderate+ content a plate tank has a role. Notice under your projection both classes have a necessary role while under mine only one does (monk). This is the crux of the warrior argument.<br />
<br />
So far only one monk has taken the hint that if you want DPS and pull specific stuff then the warriors are likely to stand with you (and by extension I would think the knights might as well) whereas under the current thinking you will alienate at least 3 classes.<br />

Nice try troll. Has anyone here said we want the hard cap back? No? Then stfu. We have specifically used the LACk of a hardcap as a reason the nerf should be removed because all the most important reasons for it no longer exist. We no longer have identical ac and close enough hp, we no longer generate enough agro through pure damage to hold the mobs attention with any sureity of success. There is no longer the hard cap that meant pretty much EVERY class in the game could mitigate as well as a warrior, (slight exageraton, but not by much) All that remains are the 11 or so all/all items that would need to be altered in some manner so that monks either cant use them, or they have an additional penalty of some sort that would make us not want to equip more than one or two of them. It doesnt require a reworking of the entire item database, its only a few items that need to be changed to totally erase any possibility of equal geared monk meeting warriors in ac.</div></div><hr />

for simplicity sake, we'll just put in the SK's average hit taken into the monks and factor in that 2% shielding.<br />
so 266.4 insteed of the monks existing 311.0 per hit.<br />
<br />
Now 3476 attacks 41.1% landed.<br />
that's 1429 (rounded up) hits landed.<br />
Now at 266.4 insteed of 311.0 damage per hit we have...<br />
380686 (rounded up) damage out of 3476 attacks.<br />
Now... we have average damage per hit? 109.51<br />
<br />
You know what the warrior was? with superior AC, SHIELDING, AND -1di....<br />
109.2<br />
<br />
Now tell me does it looks like monks SHOULD get a mitigation boost to where your AC = the same as a tank with that AC?<br />
<br />
I mean you can see how far warriors superior ac went!?<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
First, you told us that shielding was a straight 1 dps per %.  So the Monk went from 268.4 to 266.4 since the Monk has 2% shielding and the SK has none.<br />
<br />
Then you showed that a Warrior with &quot;superior AC, SHIELDING, AND -1di....&quot; would take roughly the same Damage over time as this Monk with a 60 avoidance mod and only 2% shielding instead of the Warrior's 15%.<br />
<br />
So a Monk in Time Gear would take the same damage over time as a Warrior in Time gear, but would take a hit like an SK in worse than Time Gear.<br />

Um Zotha, I was reffering to the ntov level items that were having both monks and warriors hitting the approximate same ac. You know, the whole reason for the nerf in the first place? Awhile back, in yet another topic on this very subject, Frodlin posted a magelo of a monk and warrior in the best ntov level gear, I believe it was 11 all/all items on the monk. Alter those and even the slightest justification for the nerf goes shooting down the crapper.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u220"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p220">In the perfect world you would mitigate 10% as well as we do.<br />
<br />
Muahahahahahah!!!!!11!!!11!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u221"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p221">I thought (in terms of damage taken over time) that 10 avoidance worked out to be worth about 3-4% shielding. This is on average vs GoD type trash mobs.<br />
<br />
Depends on the mob's DB/DI.  The larger the mob's DB and the smaller the mob's DI, the better avoidance is relative to shielding.  <br />
<br />
Let's run some numbers here:<br />
<br />
- I'm assuming that 10 avoidance = 1% more misses.<br />
- to make the equations look simpler I'm defining x=1d20(DI)<br />
<br />
10 avoidance = 0.01(DB + x)<br />
1% shielding = 0.01DB<br />
<br />
For 10 avoidance to equal 1% shielding you have 0.01(DB +x) = 0.01DB so x has to equal zero.  So we know that 10 avoidance is always better than 1% shielding because for them to be equal, DI would have to be zero.<br />
<br />
The most shielding I've ever seen on an item is 5%.  <br />
<br />
10 avoidance = 0.01(DB + x)<br />
5% shielding = 0.05DB<br />
<br />
For those to be equal, x must be 4 times DB so DB has to be 20% of the total damage.  So any time a mob's DB is less than 20% of it's total damage 10 avoidance is superior to 5% shielding.<br />
<br />
To me that makes it fairly obvious that avoidance is almost always superior to shielding.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I can imagine that's annoying.  Yet it's a fact of life.  You can no longer solo like you used to.  Frankly at this point in time, improving Monks to the point they could solo reasonably against mobs introduced in PoP and GoD expansions would require they be pretty overpowered indeed.

 Yeah, because they are green now. I agree, with the way pop and god mobs have turned out, I doubt even monks at their height, if the trend had continued, could still solo these guys at 65. Barring a few zones at least. But what about those of us who arent 65 yet? We dont need to go to kod taz for exp and we sub 60 monks are the ones who got beat upside the head by the mitigation nerf itself. Do we just get left out in the cold?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u226"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p226">Do we just get left out in the cold?<br />

Not really no melee class (other than likely rangers) can really solo for extended periods in reasonable content (not high end), especially without serious buffs. The soloers are all kiters or meanie nukers who can nuke a mob down at range sufficiently to survive the face to face piece of it (or can root rot or some form of it). Without guaranteed speed advantage (snare, root, etc.) and some form of ranged damage of note its hard as hell to solo today. Now boxing that is a different story and that is why this game is populated with a billion boxes now.<br />

I'm confused by this GD.  Dobbanz asks if sub-60 monks are going to be left out in the cold and I respond that they will be.  Because, as you explain in a longer answer, most all melee are left out in the cold when it comes to soloing.  So how exactly are Monks not left out in the cold?</div></div><hr />

Yes, but monks were the exception. Right from the beggining, monks were the self sufficient class that didnt need 100kpp worth of gear and a buff bot to effectively solo. Mostly I think it came down to the mend skill. If it wasnt for that thing popping up every 8 minutes or whatever the timer is, we really wouldnt have been all that superior to warriors soloing. Our downtime certaintly wouldnt have been that much better. But another part was our ability to take a hit. No, we didnt take hits as well as a warrior (im reffering to before that ntov crap btw) but we did take hits well enough to survive the times when our avoidance wasnt firing. Now, it really doesnt matter, we have basically been given the soloing ability of an untwinked warrior. Maybe even worse because half the time I cant even kill a dark blue, let alone kill it with taking little enough damage to keep on hunting. When I was 48 i would chain kill the geonids in crystal caverns for instance, all dark blues, fairly good respawn time. Usually I would be just behind the respawn, say two or three mobs would have spawned behind me by the time I finished the entire cavern area. Now, I cant even take out a KUNARK era dark blue without insane amounts of luck. <br />
<br />
Why should I, and all the other lower level monks have to suffer because the top 1% became a threat to warriors 4 expansions ago? Why did we have to continue to suffer while the actual target didnt even get scathed? What purpose does the nerf actually fulfill at this point in the game that hasnt already been taken care of through improved itemization and the application of softcaps? Can anyone truthfully answer me that? What reason is there for the nerf to still exist?</div></div><hr />

My only point in coming here was to show Pumilio/Liper that yes, monks do think mitigation &gt; avoidance for very damn good reason.<br />
<br />
Namely that for a puller, damage over time means a hell of a lot less than the frequency and size of the spikes we take.<br />
<br />
And while &quot;non-DI adjustment&quot; mitigation may not affect the size of the spike, it damn well affects the frequency ( since that's like you know the damn definition of &quot;mitigation&quot; and all ).<br />

I made my point, and those with enough intelligence to not drool while they read saw it.<br />
<br />
I'll try it again, just for you ( don't forget to wet proof your keyboard, this time. )<br />
<br />
Monks were penalized because the gear they were allowed to acquire was too good.<br />
<br />
This may have balanced out the top Monks ( those with that gear ), but it fucked those of us that didn't have it.<br />
<br />
And as the game changed, even those with that gear started getting fucked as well when they found they couldn't keep up, let alone maintain even the marginal advantage they never should have had.<br />
<br />
So here we are again, looking at a situation where Monks may have access to gear that is out of balance with the gear that a Warrior can get.<br />
<br />
Just out of balance enough that a Monk with that gear might actually be &quot;Okay&quot;, aside from getting pink misted all too frequently.<br />
<br />
And instead of changing that gear such that it's more balanced with its Warrior counterpart, your answer is to simply keep the rest of the Monk class that doesn't have that gear yet unjustly shafted.<br />

I don't think you'd find too many warriors opposed in any way to you having better than warrior mitigation with attack off, were it done right.   For instance, not unlike Healing Will, where there's a &quot;reuse time&quot; associated with the &quot;mode&quot; which pops up when you attack, and waits a few seconds before being able to be used and root bypassing it to prevent cheesedick scenarios.</div></div><hr />

I'd like you to show me the magelo of a real highend monk who concentrates on and has ac augments in all his slots.  Oh yeah ... and the highest ac warrior is probably sporting a 100+ac shield in his magelo.  <br />
<br />
If a monk wanted to, he could break the ac barriers rather easily and close the gap between themselves and plate classes rather easily.  Funny thing is ... the best monks in the game know they arent tanks and know ac augments are better suited for tanks.  Therefore they load up on better augmets for their class.   You know ... because they are smart and THEY KNOW THEY ARENT TANKS.  I'll repeat this concept one more time, just in case it hasnt penetrated your thick skull.  Talented monks know what their job is.  They choose their gear (and especially the augments therein) in a manner which complements their playstyle and their class jobs.  You show me a monk who has all ac augments, and i'll show you a fool who bought his character off ebay.<br />

The key word in that sentence is were.  They are now just as gimped at soloing as pretty much all pure melee classes.  And really there is no justification why Monks should be able to solo when Warriors and Rogues can't.  Even the hybrid classes for the most part don't solo that well any more in the 60s.  It's the trend of the game.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd much prefer that everyone be able to solo if they so wished.  But I see no logical reason why Monks should be granted that particular advantage while other classes are denied it.</div></div><hr />

Mitigation is what determines your hit distribution. I'm not talking about avoidance or overall DPS at all. I'm saying that a monk with an same amount of +AC gear as a druid takes fewer max hits because the mitigation portion of his AC is greater.<br />
<br />
I will post a detailed explanation of the reasons for the monk mitigation nerf and my current viewpoint on it next week. You want to know where I stand? I think monks do have a valid complaint about their defensive skills in the current game environment and need some adjustment.<br />

As well as:<br />
The Monk mitigation nerf was done, according to the patches (see one of my other posts for the long winded details of those patches) mostly due to the large amount of &quot;All/All items&quot; that proliferated EverQuest during Velious and Luclin. Well that itemization issue, to justify the nerf, needs to continue. Which means Monks need to have 125 AC BPs and 100 AC pants. Or else the monk mitigation nerf is simply stacking a penalty onto an itemization issue that doesn't exist. Dev notes - With the changes being considered to mitigation it is felt that this problem will be solved with the changes to mitigation not through items.

As for why monks dont put ac augs on gear, try to wrap your ignorant mind around this one you retard, maybe, just maybe they dont go stacking ac augs because they realize that ac is fricking meaningless past 1350! We still have a hardcap for all intents and purposes. Your verbal diahariha doesnt seem to take that into account. It would be like me claiming way back when ac was hardcapped for everyone, that warriors who stopped concentrating on ac past a certain point did so because they knew they werent tanks. Does that make any sense? No? Neither did what you said. A monk could aug the crap out of his gear and raise it to 3000 and STILL not tank like a knight class, so why bother? Its not because they &quot;realize they arent tanks.&quot; Its because they realize that ac is meaningless at that stage of the game for them because they hit what is effectively a hardcap.

<br />
As for why monks dont put ac augs on gear, try to wrap your ignorant mind around this one you retard, maybe, just maybe they dont go stacking ac augs because they realize that ac is fricking meaningless past 1350! We still have a hardcap for all intents and purposes. <br />
<br />
<br />
Bullshit.  There's a cap around that point in very old content like Kunark and Velious.  Nobody has found a cap thus far in PoP or GoD up to and including 3k AC.  Monks get less out of AC than other classes do but less does not equal zero.  If you want to try to be a tank as a monk then you should load up on AC augs and high AC gear.  You're shooting yourself in the foot by doing so since that isn't your strength but by all means, go ahead.  And if you choose not to do that then you sure as hell have no room to complain about how crappy you are at tanking.<br />
<br />
The days of monks being able to solo everything with no armor and bare fists as weapons are over.  Those days will never return.  Get used to it.  Monks were overpowered in that era and there was effectively no reason for them to even bother aquiring gear.  They didn't need it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your verbal diahariha doesnt seem to take that into account. It would be like me claiming way back when ac was hardcapped for everyone, that warriors who stopped concentrating on ac past a certain point did so because they knew they werent tanks. Does that make any sense? No? <br />
<br />
<br />
The warriors who stopped focusing on AC in current expansions because of a cap in previous expansions are even more foolish than monks who no longer care at all about AC.<br />
<br />
<br />
Neither did what you said. A monk could aug the crap out of his gear and raise it to 3000 and STILL not tank like a knight class, so why bother? Its not because they &quot;realize they arent tanks.&quot; Its because they realize that ac is meaningless at that stage of the game for them because they hit what is effectively a hardcap.<br />
<br />
<br />
More bullshit.  Thepp's parses show monks taking less damage over time than both Shadowknights and Paladins.  The only class in the game that takes less damage over time than a monk is a warrior even AFTER the mitigation nerf.<br />
<br />
<br />
And those slots could be put to better use by adding in things that will actually effect their character in a meaningful way.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes.  Monks who take things like ATK augs or gear that focuses on accuracy and other DPS boosting attributes have realised what their class is good at and are focusing on that.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have been mainly talking about MY experiences. I cant solo a dark blue in KUNARK, before I could. I cant solo a dark blue in ANTONICIA! Before I could. I wasnt stealing your precious job in groups before the nerf, neither were anyone else! The supertwinks were out there soloing with a botted account so they weren't stealing many exp group slots either! So why the hell should we low levels have to suffer because 4 expansions ago, the top 1% made better rampage tanks than warriors?<br />
<br />
<br />
Cry me a river...  Low levels have it incredibly easy compared to people that leveled up in past expansions due to mudflation.  I made do with bronze armor and a Fine Steel 2 hander til level 23.  I was wearing a mix of crafted and bronze at 50.  I didn't have a haste item til level 47.  My best weapon at level 50 had an 8 damage 24 delay and my other one was worse.<br />
<br />
You have equivalent AC, better avoidance, and more DPS at level 50 without any gear at all than I had in full gear at level 50.  You think that was balanced?  Dream on.</div></div><hr />

You'll note the dev didn't say &quot;omfgmonks mitigate worse then druids, and need nerfed fully repealed!&quot;<br />
<br />
Actually he said something all you retards need to pay attention to, specially if you're going to qoute him.<br />
<br />
I'm saying that a monk with an same amount of +AC gear as a druid takes fewer max hits because the mitigation portion of his AC is greater. <br />
<br />
And then this.<br />
 I think monks do have a valid complaint about their defensive skills in the current game environment and need some adjustment. <br />
<br />
you here that? ADJUSTMENT, not monks &gt; war shit again.<br />
<br />
And before you go crying about the pre-60 game.  Read this qoute from Leewi<br />
The thread I know you've read (http://p201.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessageRange?topicID=47043.topic&amp;start=321&amp;stop=336) <br />
<br />
Monks are certainly fine through level 60, even post-nerf. Fungis and T-Staves work fine through that level, and monks can effectively solo for experience. It's the post-65 game where monks lose the ability to gain AC benefits, get 1-rounded constantly by mobs in GoD, and generally have no role in experience groups.<br />
<br />
Which to think a monk has no role in a exp group is retarded, unless magically that monk we had in yxxta and kt last night was just in it for giggles....<br />
Oh, and when I went AFK, he tanked because the mobs CAN'T one round in the exp areas.</div></div><hr />
