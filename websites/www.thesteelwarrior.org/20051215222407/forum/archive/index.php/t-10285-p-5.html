<br />
How many free days on their account did they get?<br />
<br />
None?<br />
<br />
Oh.<br />
<br />
Did they get ANYTHING in exchange for not being able to play their game?<br />
<br />
Huh.</div></div><hr />

LMAO  ^^<br />

Though, last night was NOT funny.  I got done xp-ing for the day and tried to log out, thats when the fun began.  After 2 minutes of sitting there after the countdown had ended, I could still move my mouse and send/recieve tells from my wife who was playing right beside me.  I finally hard reset my comp and logged back in to see what the deal was.  I logged back into an empty Southshore Inn.  All the NPCs in town had disappeared.  On top of that I noticed, much to my displeasure, that I was missing over 8000xp from the time I logged out.  Once again I had to hard reset my comp to exit the world.  I logged back in this morning and was attacked by a bear along the river.  My char was mysteriously at 33% health with 20sec left on Battleshout... amazing since I logged at the Inn last night at full health and no buffs on.  After I barely succeeding defending myself against this bear, I noted that my xp had not been restored.  In fact I was now missing another 3000xp on top of the 8000 I lost last night.  So, today I started the adventuring 11kxp in the whole and with a barren inventory that was filled with hours worth of loots from the previous night.  <br />

Oh well... I dinged 30 and am going to start the quest for my Berserk Stance and Whirlwind weapon after work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-27-2005, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">after awhile they started to post info on a scrolling banner on the server select screen.  hehe that was a big deal back then.  thing was, it wasn't the life ending event that it is now back then... folks (at least a lot of em that I saw) kinda got the idea that this was massive and new so it would have lots of kinks to get worked out.  even back in the text based mud days server crashes were pretty common. kinda goes with the territory of running a live virtual world on a computer.<br />
<br />
peoples expectations have changed a lot in the past few years.  so has their general maturity level.  now that everyone's used to the internet and the novelty has worn off, they want it, they want it all, they want it now, and their gonna pitch a bitch like a three year old the moment they percieve something is amiss (even if nothing is lol).<br />
<br />
Even still, it is funny to see Blizzard falling flat on their collective asses after being made into demi-gods for such a long time.  But they are learning and trying to make things better (refunding peoples money for service outages).  That about the most one could possibly expect, all things concidered.</div></div><hr />

How much of his exp did he get back?<br />
<br />
None.<br />
<br />
Did he get ANYTHING for the server crashing and losing lots of cash and exp?<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
But he DID get another 5 days to play the game, so that it could happen again... and again.... and again.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I love the game, just wish the stuff would get fixed.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't that pretty much mean they've made up for crashes through OoW?</div></div><hr />
