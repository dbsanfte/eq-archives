<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarn_Rider</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings Warriors<br />
<br />
I'm a Warrior that will often swap out weapons during fights, especially when I am soloing, even more so when I play an alt, and swap out swarmcaller for a slow when bow kiting gets boring(on my Ranger alt).<br />
<br />
As of late I've spoken to several people, of different classes, that state that they do not like swapping weapons, because they say it is a pain to open up their inventory, a bag, and then proceed to swap things around.<br />
<br />
I thought perhaps some do not realize the much easier way to swap out weapons and such, so I thought perhaps I would share it.<br />
<br />
Turn to an empty page of hotbuttons. I have many of my normal hotbuttons set up on Page one, and then a pulling/tanking set up on Page 2. <br />
<br />
So I turned to page 10, which was one click backwards, and I set up my swapping system.<br />
<br />
when you have those 10 hotbuttons that are all empty on page 10(or whatever #.) open up your inventory, and then left click and hold on your primary, secondary, and range slots. Click until they pop up on your cursor, then place them into the hot buttons, generaly Primary/Secondary on top, and the range/ammo below it.<br />
<br />
Then, generally I only use 4 bags and a quiver, leaving me 3 empty inventory spaces. I then put those 3 empty inventory slots into the hotbuttons, and when soloing, or needing to swap weapons, I keep my Swarmcaller or extra bow, or whichever I may need, in those inventory slots.<br />
<br />
Then it is only a matter of clicking one direction to a new set of hotkeys, clicking on the weapon I want, and then sliding it into the spots. I don't take up any space or loose site of my target with the bulky inventory screen, I don't have to open up several bags, etc.<br />
<br />
To me this has worked very nicely for quite some time now.<br />
<br />
I hope it helps some one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had that happen to me for a while, got me a new mouse.<br />
Can also happen if windows have the double click speed set oddly.<br />
<br />
<br />
humm ... oh, and you might have hit the ESC button, which also closes bags/windows.<br />
<br />
Cannot imagine anything else to close your bags unprovoked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't have to keep the bag open the entire time.  Look at slot number 7..that's my treasure hunter's satchel, IE : my weapons stash bag.  I hit 7, swap what I need to swap, put it back, hit 7 again, bag closes, done. <br />
<br />
I used to do what you're describing, but eventually you get more toys than inventory slots and you have to switch to bags.</div></div><hr />

/lightbulb goes off.<br />
<br />
Oooooooh, I see. /laugh.<br />
<br />
Thank you Haas. I never really considered putting a bag itself like that.<br />
<br />
I think I may try that if my bags co-operate. <br />
<br />

Thank you for the advice. I will give it a shot with a mouse on a different computer.</div></div><hr />

So if I have a container open, I have access to both weapon slots.<br />
<br />
I normally keep my &quot;utility&quot; container open at all times.  I have it moved off to the side of my screen, and it only closes when I zone.  I keep all my weapons in there, and can easily swap as needed.<br />
<br />
You can see my setup in this image:<br />

<br />
You need to be able to make a hotkey that will swap in or disarm a set of weapons with 1 key stroke.  Using the fucking mouse is a pain in the ass, lame, and makes my arm/shoulder hurt :P</div></div><hr />

My front page is always full of macros and such that I use on raids so it's nice to be able to swap stuff without taking up hotkeys.<br />

And although I've said it 100 times, Sars &gt; All</div></div><hr />

I customized some of my hotboxes to coincide with the clickable items i use most frequently, but the rest is the same as downloaded.<br />
Also, the bags are great for swapping in and out as you need.</div></div><hr />

Sars (http://sars.has.it)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarn_Rider</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ugh. I tried Sars twice and had EQ Crash each time I tried to load with it. *laughs.*<br />
<br />
Any other alternate good Melee UI's?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abividad</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmmmm Sars has been my only really reliable custom UI. All the others have a bad habit of bugging something like confirmation boxes. What you can also do is this if Sars is really giving you a hard time:<br />
<br />
Download Sars<br />
Copy only the EQUI container XML file<br />
Paste that file into the UI you use.<br />
<br />
I did that for Abi's UI before Sars had a decent caster UI and got the bags with pri/sec/range/ammo slots on top of them.<br />
<br />
Whenever Illmarr uses his DW setup I do the ghetto bash swapping. works nice until 3 spells land just as I'm doing it and 10 seconds later I see that I'm standing there like a Pally with a shield still equipped cause of the lag. I know you've seen me do it too with the Ranja...LOL</div></div><hr />

Truely, looks great, until you try to move boxes...  <br />
<br />
I don't find the boxes hard to move.  But if you don't like it, there is a hack to put the headers back on them.  Or you can just /loadskin default 1, move your boxes, then /loadskin sars 1 and you're set.</div></div><hr />

But they haven't posted an updated version in a long time.  So my version is massively customized to work for all of the patches and changes in the last 4 months.<br />

<br />
All of the swap box and hotkey stuff is easilly customizable and there's even a seperate UI to set things up easilly.<br />
<br />
It still doens't change the fact that I HATE using the mouse to swap weapons.  I want a hotkey to swap weapons in and out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarn_Rider</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for the advice on the UI.<br />
<br />
I tried out Sars, and finally got i to work. I saw my EQclient was missing a line that Sars required.<br />
<br />
So far I like it, but indeed, it's annoying to arrange some of the boxes that don't seem to want to move unless I change UI's and move them that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Boxes are easy to move in Sars.  Just drag the first side to where you want it, then the second.  Slightly longer than just carrying the box, but it's not difficult.  Just don't be afraid to temporarily make a huge box while moving it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarn_Rider</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Err, sorry. <br />
<br />
By Boxes, I meant like individual pieces. The text message boxes I got set up easily.<br />
<br />
It's the dang Target &amp; Self health boxes/windows I'm having trouble moving about just the way I want them.</div></div><hr />
