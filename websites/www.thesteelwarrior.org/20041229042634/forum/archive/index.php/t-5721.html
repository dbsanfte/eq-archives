<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a work in progress, hopefully we can get some good info as more people spend time in Ferubi. There seems to be a pretty good opportunity for getting a named in this zone, it is still unclear if the single groupable named are triggered or on some sort of timer.<br />
<br />
Any additional info would be appreciated!<br />
<br />
1. The most efficient way to get to the named are is to zone in from Riwwi. There are less mobs in the way. Most static spawns do not see invis, but on occasion they do so be sure to con everything on the way in.<br />
<br />
2. The vast majority of the mobs can be single pulled by a competent puller, in occassion you may get a 2 pull, but so far all of the non-named appear to be mezzable.<br />
<br />
3. It would appear that all of the wanderers see invis. I have yet to encounter one that didn't. My group would charge the wanderers when they would get to a spot that would result in the least amount of adds.<br />
<br />
Here is what I have so far on the named using the map below -<br />
<br />
1. Pxet Elite Blademaster (loot and trigger)<br />
2. Hexx Gkon<br />
3. Pxet Elite Spearmaster (loot and trigger)<br />
4. Hexxt N`Vak Tkan<br />
5. Smith Rondo (Weapon Master Vtiink Vzaan trigger)<br />
6. Pxet Elite Brawler (loot and trigger)<br />
7. Packmaster Skoiat Pizak (Raid mob)<br />
8. Pixtt Votal (ZMV pet)<br />
9. Zun`Muram Votal (Raid mob)<br />
10. Pixtt Votal (ZMV pet)<br />
11. Pxet Elite Hammermaster (loot and trigger)<br />
12. Pxet Vzanki Kzan<br />
<br />
Other named - Rav Ptvin and Rev Hunter appear to be random spawns in several locations. They also appear to wander, but this is not certain. Hexxt Pzik Shziaak <br />
is an archer that can spawn anywhere other archers can spawn. Pxet Elite Spearman is listed on Allakhazam's but this mob may not exist (probably meant Spearmaster).<br />
<br />
The Pxet Elite _____master mobs not only drop loot, but also broken weapon pieces. Once you collect the 4 broken weapon pieces, you hand them in to Smith Rondo to trigger Weapon Master Vtiink Vzaan.<br />
<br />
The Pixtt Votal are Zun`Muram Votal's pets and do not drop loot.<br />
<br />
Time equipped groups should be able to take all but the raid mobs. A high end EP, near Time group should do fine with a warrior tanking. New to EP or pre-EP guilds should consider multi-grouping the named. 2-3 groups would be fine for mid level raid guilds. Really the limit is going to be the quality of your tanks. I would say bare minimum HP for a warrior to tank with defensive and a few healers is going to be 8k or so buffed. The named hit for 1200-1400 (I forget exactly how much) and they hit fast. I am pretty sure that all of the non-raid named are partially slowable.<br />

I don't know which way is right and I'd recommend just kill everything around where the Elites are to make sure.  <br />
<br />
Pixtt Votal is Zun'Muram Votal's pet.  Doesn't drop anything pretty sure.</div></div><hr />

Weapon Master Vtiink Vzaan, Rav Ptvin, and Rev Hunter. I do not have any spawn locations for these mobs. <br />
Weapons Master Vtiink is triggered, as stated earlier.<br />
<br />
Rav Ptvin are also triggered mobs, as a part of a different event.  They're not really &quot;named&quot; in the sense that they drop any loot, they just have capitalized names.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All of the elites are static spawns with set but different respawn timers.  Blademaster is a little over 2 hours, Hammermaster is about the same, and I haven't had the chance to time the others.    <br />
<br />
There's a couple other static spawns, but I leave it to you to learn them.</div></div><hr />

Pretty entertaining little encounter there.</div></div><hr />

Both where up when we got to the zone.</div></div><hr />

I spend most of my time in the southern halls, and the Elite respawn without me doing anything in their rooms.<br />
<br />
As for Rondo, what does the Weapon Master hit for?  I know Triadica did him recently on my server, Krassus wanna share the sekrets with us?</div></div><hr />

Killed him yesterday and got a hybrid belt with 12ac 90 hp/mana 7 wis/int and a bunch of other stats and resists.<br />
<br />
He showed up half way through killing the blademaster, droped the chanter and sham before slow but we still got him.<br />
<br />
The blademaster was in the place where the spear master is listed as being, they are likely switched around.</div></div><hr />

I think he hits for like 1600 but I didn't keep track.  Has 4 reasonably strong adds with some pretty hard to resist and annoying (but not too powerful) AEs.  Most of them will mez.</div></div><hr />

Killed [Rev Ptvin] yesterday and got a hybrid belt with 12ac 90 hp/mana 7 wis/int and a bunch of other stats and resists. <br />
Perhaps I was thinking of Rev Hunter, then.  I know one of the two(or a third mob with a very similar name) is a mob you'll encounter during the Packmaster fight, but when Baxter said Rev Hunter was a roaming dog in Votal's room, I assumed it was the other of the two I was remembering.</div></div><hr />

Say an 8kish tank 4kish mana cleric 4kish mana shaman.  Group would have around 100+ aas average with the warrior full defensive.  Probably have a solid pre VT ranger and Monk in the group also.  Monk has 200+ aa's and is a good puller.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I just read deeper in another thread that a pre-EP guild should probably bring 3-4 groups.  In that post they said it probably would be worth the time to do so...does everyone agree that this might be a could place to go on a raid night for us?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobsmash</div><div class="date">02-19-2004, 04:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first time we attacked the Pxet Elite Blademaster it was a double spawn, between the 2 named and the 4 pets (2 each) I was owned before furious was down and the group soon after. The second time got it single and the pets had been triggered and disappeared so it was only the named, I had –just- been rezed and had no buffs got a few buffs while I tanked her with furious hit defensive, it was real easy. The pets account for 40-60% of the DPS though they are short term. They poped during the fight were mezzed quickly and disappeared before the end of the fight.<br />
<br />
PS I am a elemental geared to around 10k and 1850 ac raid buffed, I think if you can get her with no pets a warrior buffed to 7500 could tank her with defensive easy just get good chanter to CC the 2 adds.</div></div><hr />

Rest seemed pretty accurate. We also had one other named spawn in the Zun room. The one marked 12 spawned behind number 6, but it could be different spawns<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baxter</div><div class="date">03-07-2004, 08:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hexxt N'Vak Tkan (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14212)  has a fixed PH in the South Eastern diagonal hallway.  The PH is the mob right at the bend where the hall turns north.<br />
<br />
I can't find its name, but there is a named PH in the South West corner of the Hammermaster room.  Facing the false wall going to Rondo, its the left mob.<br />
<br />
Rav Ptvin (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14211) has a wandering PH in the North West diagonal hall, sticks to this general area when roaming.<br />
<br />
Rav Hunter (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14470) has a wandering PH in the South East room where ZMV spawns.<br />
<br />
Both wandering PH share their wandering named pathing.<br />
<br />
The Elites all spawn two shaman-like pets on engage, easily mezable, and they depop after a few seconds of being mezed.  There have been overspawns lately, where there are several of the same Elite spawned right on top of each other.  Monks or FM bards are able to split them.  They all drop level 60 or 65 spells, any era.  Usually berserker Tome's, but sometimes you get lucky with a GoD spell.  The augments they drop are the same every time, and always drop. 2x15AC, 2x25hp/mana/end from the four elites.<br />
<br />
The further south you go into the zone, the greater the mob density and more prevalent the wanderers.  The loot of the named does not scale with this.  The roamers of the south area all spawn in the same spot in the Brawler room, and all wander to the Packmaster area.  There are some roamers who go from the zone ins to the Packmaster and back.  There are low resists on lull, nothing like LDoN where you can go for 5 resists.  Monks/Bards/Enchanters are excellent pullers, so long as you peel from them asap.<br />
<br />
The Ukun are the only mobs I have found that see invis.  Their emote says that they smell you, which is fitting as they are the GoD &quot;dogs.&quot;<br />
<br />
The group I go regularly with brings 2 healers, usually 2 clerics, if we're strapped a very good druid will do.  This isn't so much for my own benefit as it is the chanters.  To speed things along, we always charm a Mastruq Fiend/Warfiend or other warrior type.  Everything is charmable, but these break charm the least often.  They also have the added benefit of not protecting the Enchanter.  The dogs cast an AE dispel when they are charmed and they engage a mob.  We also bring a necro for emergency reses and usually to summon us out in a wipe.  The spawn time for the normal mobs is about 20 minutes, and unless you get to one of the two safe camps in the zone, or get lucky and wipe mid spawn, you're screwed.  Those two camps are as follows (safe because of very little or no roamers and low density): #4, north side where the named PH is; #11, also where the named PH is (SW corner).  Everywhere else you have to be on top of spawn times for the roamers and statics.<br />
<br />
You won't get a good feeling for the zone until you pass the Elites, East or West, afterwhich the zone becomes five times as dangerous.  The exp here is the same as PoP zones (44% mod) and the mobs seem to die as quickly or quicker if you get a charmed pet.<br />
<br />
edit- It's Ukun that see, guess I was tired when writing this.</div></div><hr />

From what i gather the Nihil Chanter Ritual Gem (36% Haste Type 7 Aug) drops from him.  Since getting the Loyalist Shield of Honor my haste item has been replaced with Tribute haste and the cost is killing me.  I'd love to have this aug.<br />
Is Hexxt Pzik Shziaak single group or raid mob?<br />

I went in with some friends and spent a few hours getting the smith rondo trigger items but i didn't see Hexxt Pzik Shziaak on track so i'm not sure where to go to try and kill to trigger his/her spawn.<br />

I've had luck with blademaster killing in from Qinimi and also pulling the far west nook of her room.<br />

Spearmaster spawned once for me crawling from Riwwi to her room.  Yet tonight we slaughtered everything from riwwi to barindu to her room and back and...nothing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just curious, are named on the same timer as the regular mobs?  In other words, can you possibly get 2 named in a row, making it worthwhile if other named aren't up to just double back and reclear rooms even if you just killed a named there?  <br />
<br />
That's what we're assuming, which means ferubi can comfortably support several groups and small raids hunting the named.  <br />
<br />
Also, do they have a specific spawn point in the rooms shown or should you be sure to clear everything in the room?  We've run through rooms 1-4 a number of times.  We've gotten the elite in room 1 several times.  We never see a named in room 2.  We never see a named in room 4.  hmm...<br />
<br />
I'm in a pre-elem guild and lately I've been running the occasional small raid to Ferubi as sort of a &quot;welcome to GoD&quot; thing for people.  It's a good experience to get everyone crawling through an area where everything, including roamers, can be so deadly and once in awhile a good drop is had.  People learn to stay on their toes.  Guildies dying random &quot;probably wasn't paying enough attention&quot; deaths are down 68% since the first time I ran it.  Ok, I made that number up.  But they're down a lot.  :)  Good zone.</div></div><hr />

Also saw a series of nice trash mob drops that you don't have listed, but a few look close, my guess is they upgraded them and renamed them.</div></div><hr />
