<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazzuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I started this to dispell some of the myths knights and others (including other warriors) have been propogating on this board lately.. not to start (yet) another bitch fest knights.<br />
<br />
We can ALL AGREE level 50 and below for warriors and knights there is ZERO difference in skill caps... thus 50 and below knights if geared equivalently are the hands down best XP group tanks and raid group tanks. If you have trouble with the above statement send me a email at kazz@esisnet.com and we can chat that way, no use clogging this board with useless crap.<br />
<br />
Now, 50+, there starts to be some disparity in skill caps.. but not really until about 55 which is when many knight skill caps will have capped, up till around then there will still be no diff. At 55 warriors get defensive which puts us in the lead at raids, well.. for one to three wars on that raid anyway.<br />
<br />
Knights have said time and again that they get agro lock due to wars having great advantages in AC, HP, DPS. While pre Kunark days when everything was very different.. this may have been true... NOW though... today... it is NOT. Please take the time to read below and I will debunk these myths as we delve into the mysteries of the Tanks of EQ.....<br />
<br />

double attack      245<br />
Taunt              230<br />
<br />
Here is the kicker:<br />
<br />
Diff between a pallie and war =<br />
Offense - 27 skill points<br />
Defense - 0 (yes ZERO)<br />
Weaponskills - 25 points (except piercing which wars cap at 240, and 15 point diff there)<br />
Parry - 25 skill points<br />
Dodge - 20 skill points<br />
Double Attack - 10 skill points<br />
Taunt - 10 skill points<br />
<br />
Diff betwen a SK and a war =<br />
Offense - 27 skill points<br />
Defense - 0 (yes ZERO)<br />
Weaponskills - 25 points (except piercing which wars cap at 240, and 15 point diff there)<br />
Parry - 25 skill points<br />
Dodge - 20 skill points<br />
Double Attack - 10 skill points<br />
Taunt - 20 skill points<br />
<br />
Now that the basics of the class skill caps have been shown, lets get down to business.<br />
<br />
First lets debunk the Melee DMG myth that wars way out damage knights....<br />
<br />
Now it has been parsed time and time again that the 10 skill points diff between 240 and 250 a war has in piercing equates to less than 10% of his overall DPS (close to 5% really from Ranger Glades or the Outhouse, I forget which.. been a while) and assuming average geared level 65 war in POP (Cultuaral + NToV armor, some ssra, between 7-8K buffed) his DPS using a decent 2 hander is maybe 100 DPS (talkin Windblade quality here guys.. not BoW), but.. since he cannot hold aggro with that hes now using something like a BoC (if lucky) or more likely a frosty/new-yak/wavecrasher/snowchipper (insert yer fav aggro weapon that can be bought or camped here) so DPS is more in the 60 range with max haste and decent attack buffs, thus the War will usually do MUCH LESS in the DPS category than a knight in the group... since the average Knight can take advantage of the 2 hander bonus and keep aggro lock while the average Warrior cannot and must dual wield. It has also been shown that the disparity of 10 skill points in double attack is so small that it cannot be accurately determined by parsing (falls well within the STD error). But even giving you a whopping 5% for the minimal riposte and double attack skill differences, knights will still come out considerably ahead. <br />
<br />
Thus in XP GROUPS (and raids if war is tanking, esp with def which cuts our dps by 40% or more) Knights will outdamage a war by a considerable amount. (if avg war does 100 DPS with a 2 hander the avg SK would do 12% and the avg pallie 17% less or 88 DPS for the SK and 83 DPS for the pallie MELEE DMG, THIS IN NO WAY ACCOUNTS FOR ANY SPELL DMG) Thus you have the war trying to hold aggro at 60 DPS, the Knight holding aggro at 83 DPS depending. Take another 5% off for riposte and double attack and you get 78 DPS, still considerably higher. Also note this is simplistic view on DPS but still generally accurate way to look at it and holds true for the parses I have done myself and seen from others. <br />
<br />
This is also accounting for equivalent weaponry... when it seems Knights have a much much wider array of weaponry that outclasses most war 2handers avail to them, but, lets keep it equal and stick with the windblade which is usable by all tank classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now lets move onto the &quot;Wars have much more AC than knights myth....<br />
<br />
I will agree... in equiv gear... A warrior will probably have more AC than a knight while both are UNBUFFED. Is that number &quot;Much More&quot; as most knights would have you believe... I say no. Is it the knights fault.. no, there is ZERO skill cap diff in defense skills so ac for ac we are identical, the problem here stems from poor itemization, most of the gear that Wars can wear and would want to wear and prize for the AC and or HPs are also wearable by knights.. and also have mana on em... thus... the higher up into the game you go... the less and less of an advantage warriors will have. Given identical gear, a knight and a war would have identical AC. This is purely a matter of gear and lack of itemization for individual classes. <br />
<br />
One advantage Knights have on top of their War parent class: Knights can also self buff and usually close or even come ahead of the equiv war on AC. Some of these buffs even stack with the buffs both classes would get from clerics/shammies, etc...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, onto the HPs diff... knights and warriors all have the exact same AA's available for boosting their overall HPs, so that is not a factor. Wars get a bit more HP per sta but that is minimal after 255 sta is reached, most of a wars HPs will come from raw HP items later in the game once all tank classes are 65. Lets look at EQ rankings and pick the top 15-20 listing for war and pallies and SKs if we order the lists via HPs shall we. These arent the number 1 people server wide... but damned close (15-20 server wide that have eqrankings look at their magelos to be exact).<br />
<br />
SK = http://www.eqrankings.com/?rm=list&amp;class=Shadowknight&amp;server=&amp;order=HP<br />
<br />
      HP     Mana   UMR    ATK   AC   <br />
 15   6836   5511   10     1354  1708 <br />
 16   6824   5436   18     1369  1707 <br />
 17   6824   5506   5      385   1122 <br />
 18   6818   5541   10     1400  1792 <br />
 19   6818   5636   13     1373  1745 <br />
 20   6789   5491   15     1354  1659 <br />
<br />
Ok, number 17 here doesnt know how to update his skills in magelo, so discount his ac and attack... but lets see:<br />
Avg HPS = 6818.16666 so lets say 6818 HP<br />
<br />
Pallie = http://www.eqrankings.com/?rm=list&amp;class=Paladin&amp;server=&amp;order=HP<br />
<br />
     HP     Mana   UMR  ATK    AC   <br />
15   6864   5566   17   1459   1798 <br />
16   6847   5701   18   1454   1825 <br />
17   6836   5601   5    1436   1810 <br />
18   6830   5656   18   1465   1862 <br />
19   6830   5501   6    1279   1693 <br />
20   6830   5571   18   1406   1786 <br />
<br />
Avg HPS = 6839.5 so lets say 6840 HP<br />
<br />
War = http://www.eqrankings.com/?rm=list&amp;class=Warrior&amp;server=&amp;order=HP<br />
<br />
     HP     ATK    AC<br />
15   7810   1662   1863 <br />
16   7804   1562   1901 <br />
17   7792   1562   1864 <br />
18   7792   1562   1947 <br />
19   7792   1562   1900 <br />
20   7769   1562   1881 <br />
<br />
Note, Warriors don't get unbuffed mana regen (UMR) duh!<br />
Avg HPS = 7793.166666 so lets say 7793 HP<br />
<br />
Diff between Pallie and war at the TOP = 953 HP<br />
Diff between a SK and a war at the TOP = 975 HP<br />
<br />
Now, mind you.. this is at the TOP of the game, best you can get gear part of the game and this is the most HP diff you will find. The difference shrinks to about 500 HP or so at the average level, when XP mobs hit for 400-600 a pop and often double and triple hit.... you can see why the warriors say its a meaningless difference. Also have to remeber, that the warrior is dual wielding... so is eating alot more ripostes too.... (we are using equiv weapons here again remember.... if he used a 2 hander it would be a windblade, and hed have no chance in hell of holding aggro). Anyway you look at it.. its pretty safe to say UNBUFFED a war has from a 500 to a 1K ish HP advantage over the Knight, most put it in equiv gear at about 600 or so, and that seems to be true for my guild.<br />
<br />
<br />
So..... lets recap shall we....<br />
<br />
AC.... no real differences to note if gear is equivalent, that is also reflected in the magelo ranks listed above, where there seems to be less than 100 ac diff in most cases and this is UNBUFFED.<br />
<br />
DPS, Knights in XP groups actually have the advantage here.. not the other way around... this is due to the insane 2 hander bonus but never the less it is true, knights also seem to like to forget they have spells for DPS gains as well, so I didn't include SPELL DPS at all and the knight still came out on top.<br />
<br />
HPs, yes, the Warrior has some HP advantage, we are argueing that its not significant and knight self buffs nearly negate it anyway.<br />
<br />
Mitigation, the fourth things knights like to say.. you mitigate better.... well.. they changed that on or about the same patch they changed knights skill caps, that is in the patch message.. go look it up... October from a two years ago I think... <br />
<br />
Well we want defensive then is another common argument... shit. I say you can have it... you think its so high and mighty of a skill.... LOL... I don't mind living through a raid cause I'm not tanking. It is certainly not a skill I use often if ever in a XP group. You do know it also cuts your DPS by 40% as well, right? IMHO defensive is the single largest reason warriors have had NO improvements made to them in so damned long. Most wars feel defensive should be done away with and Wars should be put on their own mitigation tables instead of sharing them with knights and some others...<br />
<br />
No, I do not advocate a nerf, though it sometimes seems to be the most sensible way to correct the balance issues. I advocate giving the warrior a true advantage in AC, Mitigation and HPs, right now there is not a significant difference between us and our knight brothers in these areas and it makes knights the clear choice for the XP group tank<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually warriors have a much better HP advantage in say the average level 65 guy in Valor range.  Show me some buyable armor for a Paladin that's anywhere as good as Fierce Heraldric or Helanic Tundra.  Yes not eveyone worships Zek or Tribunal but no Paladin even has a such a choice, not to mention Zek/Tribunal covers most of the big races and thus a good percentage of the warriors.  SK has some decent cultural armor I think but I don't know much about them, and I don't think it's better than FH anyway.<br />
<br />
Weapon-wise, you can always buy a Windblade and plenty of other affordable 2H weapons that come with PoP.  Sure if someone has a Goldenrod and you're not yet past tier 3 you'll lose on the weapon choices but such examples probably aren't the norm.  At any rate Cursed capable guilds should have Bloodfrenzy, and if that's not good enough for a group then that group doesn't deserve a warrior.  <br />
<br />
DPS-wise, Warrior always beats Paladin except on Undead.  Aura of Hate will bring a SK's attack to near warrior levels (it's actually higher but it's also only up 75% of the time so it ends up being still lower) but this basically stops the SK from doing anything else with his mana unless he doesn't want to cast Zevfeer's Bite.  Actually, since Aura of Hate is shared, SK has no advantage at all.  If you want to compare the DPS of a SK with Aura of Hate versus a Warrior without Aura of Hate (a group spell) then you might as well say Paladins do more damage because they have a self-haste and Paladins have more HP because they can buff themselves and not buff a warrior (clearly Brell/Hero/Symbol/Aura &gt; Warrior HP advantage).  <br />
<br />
Mitigation-wise, there is no reason to believe we don't mitigate exactly the same with the same AC.  That said warrior only armor tends to have a few more AC and it adds up to quite a bit over time, but this is somewhat offset by the Knight 2H weapons tend to have a good amount of AC on them.  At any rate, in an xp group mitigation should not be a key issue because if it is then the stuff you're fighting is already too hard for the group anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Any SK that knows his class &amp; has KEI will own a warrior in DPS.<br />
No paladin ever will, but they offer more versatility.<br />
<br />
As for the tanking... We're still 1st , well ahead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You may be right Phantron, but all things considered I still think this post sums up the balance issue pretty well.  Ultimately, our hp/ac advantage and /disc defensive don't even come close to setting us apart from knights, nor do they in any way compensate for the loss of utility we suffer for being the, and I use this term loosely &quot;pure tank&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kazzuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually warriors have a much better HP advantage in say the average level 65 guy in Valor range.  <br />
<br />
Myth, debunked above....<br />
<br />
Also, SKs have access to pretty much all the cultural armor warriors have access to, including Fierce Heraldic. Pallie, well.. Luminent is better than most warriors can get and even Fine Heraldic. Also, lets compare apples to apples... if we are a bazaar twink then lets stay one... most old school wars that wre around before Kunark are like myself.. agnostic and unable to take advantage of the cultural armors.<br />
<br />
Weapon wise.. yer fooling yourself if you think the 18 or so Knight only weapons that drop in ssra are equivalent to the 2 or 3 that are war usable.... don't even get me started on NToV...<br />
<br />
DPS-wise, Warrior always beats Paladin except on Undead. <br />
<br />
Sure, if we can use our 2 hander and hold aggro.. the issue is... we cannot.. the average warrior is forced to use &quot;aggro&quot; weapons with subpar ratios in order to keep even a semblence of aggro. The knight does not have this restriction, I have seen a knight MA vindicator withour taking one melee swing the entire fight, and never once lost aggro, yes, Vindi is easy.. but ya get my point??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Interesting thread.  I'm in no position to make a solid opinion of it all, but I'm curious to see where this goes.</div></div><hr />

Actually warriors have a much better HP advantage in say the average level 65 guy in Valor range.<br />
<br />
No. They don't. The difference holds through all levels of the game at about 10% for similarly geared paladins and warriors. Remember, you also need to take into account buffs such as BSS and BotC.<br />
<br />
At any rate Cursed capable guilds should have Bloodfrenzy, and if that's not good enough for a group then that group doesn't deserve a warrior.<br />
<br />
Not necessarily. I am in a Cursed capable guild, and we've killed him 20+ times. WE've gotten ONE BF. The other six guild warriors are still waiting.<br />
<br />
Actually, since Aura of Hate is shared, SK has no advantage at all.<br />
<br />
No. the SK has many advantages. IE, FD, Dots, lifetaps, all sorts of hate increasers. I find it extremely hard to believe that the SK is limited to using one and ONLY one spell in experience groups.<br />
<br />
 If you want to compare the DPS of a SK with Aura of Hate versus a Warrior without Aura of Hate (a group spell) then you might as well say Paladins do more damage because they have a self-haste and Paladins have more HP because they can buff themselves and not buff a warrior (clearly Brell/Hero/Symbol/Aura &gt; Warrior HP advantage).<br />
<br />
You cannot discuss classes without bringing each class's abilities and spells into it. Secondly, abilities such as the paladin self haste, and hero/symbol are not usually taken into account, due to the fact they are rarely used in a group. Other people have better.<br />
<br />
That said warrior only armor tends to have a few more AC and it adds up to quite a bit over time<br />
<br />
WHAT warrior only armour? Other than the ornate and elemental armours, 99.9% of armour that a warrior can use, the knights can use too. <br />
<br />
but this is somewhat offset by the Knight 2H weapons tend to have a good amount of AC on them.  At any rate, in an xp group mitigation should not be a key issue because if it is then the stuff you're fighting is already too hard for the group anyway.  <br />
No. Mitigation can be just as much of a concern if the group is in a place that's just fine for them to fight in, for the simple fact that it allows more kills per hour, due to less healer mana usage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A pretty complete analysis from where I stand.  I've presented the same case myself on a number of occassions, just not as thoroughly.  Good job.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Taunt skill caps got raised for warriors and knights at some point, so Im assuming Kazzuk got his skill caps from some site like casters realm which hasn't updated its class areas since I used it as a reference to create my first toon many years ago.<br />
<br />
That said, Warriors never received an upgrade where knights didnt receive one aswell (though the same can not be said for knights receiving upgrades) so the points made above still stand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think your comparison is a bit skewed, but one thing in particular that seemed wierd was this:<br />
<br />
Thus in XP GROUPS (and raids if war is tanking, esp with def which cuts our dps by 40% or more) Knights will outdamage a war by a considerable amount. (if avg war does 100 DPS with a 2 hander the avg SK would do 12% and the avg pallie 17% less or 88 DPS for the SK and 83 DPS for the pallie MELEE DMG, THIS IN NO WAY ACCOUNTS FOR ANY SPELL DMG) Thus you have the war trying to hold aggro at 60 DPS, the Knight holding aggro at 88 or 83 DPS depending on yer flavor of knight. <br />
<br />
Now, why is the warrior, which was just sited as doing 100dps, suddenly doing 60? Is is because of defensive? If so, 1) warriors aren't using defensive much of the time in xp groups and 2) You neglect to mention that while the disc is up they are taking a heck of a lot less damage than a knight would. It looks like you are comparing defense without defensive and offensive with defensive which is....well, skewed. Unless there is some other reason the warrior suddenly took a 40% dps hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The warrior took a 40% DPS hit because he had to bag his Windblade and use a frosty and red epic for aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ah, I see, that is a somewhat bizarre argement after all the posts on this board about how in PoP a Windblade is a far better option than just about any buyable 1h setup. Not surprising, but bizarre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Windblade is a far better DPS option.<br />
<br />
The common theme seems to be that warriors lack in &quot;snap agro&quot; - meaning they can't get a big hit of hate at the beginning of the fight and mobs will be more interested in eating the slower than pummeling the tank.<br />
<br />
So to compensate warriors will use a weapon with an agro proc on it which gives them an opportunity to build up a decent amount of hate before the slow / first heal lands.  Once the mob is slowed and agro is sitting happily on the tank the warrior can then swap in the windblade and start to see some nice DPS happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mathas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just to clarify correct SK skill caps at 65:<br />
<br />
Offense - 225 (not 230, any melee skill we share with paladins should have the same cap)<br />
Dodge - 170 (not 155)<br />
Taunt - 220 (not 180)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kazzuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Gimmel, the Windblade is fairly nice DPS, no one is saying it is not... but it totally blows for aggro. It is a weapon I used when I did NOT want aggro hehe, you know... when I was the 4th or 5th tank at the raid....<br />
<br />
And yes, the avg war in the example above was doing 60 DPS because he could not use his nice DPS windblade and hope to hold aggro... so had to bag it to dual wield his frosty/red epic (or such hehe) and pray to the gods of RNG for a proc.<br />
<br />
I hope this better helps you understand our arguement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I use a 2hander similar to Windblade and my perception is that the higher DPS will give me much more solid aggro towards the middle of the fight, but won't necessarily give me much at the beginning unless I just get very lucky with a string of nice hits.<br />
<br />
Duel wielding procing weapons will give you decent aggro at the beginning of the fight, if you get a proc.  But you drop serious DPS to do it and as we've already discussed procs are unreliable.  So we have a divided camp on the subject.  Some Warriors will go 2hand weapon because it far out damages their duel wield combo while others will go duel wield in hopes of procing regularly and gaining aggro in that way.  Neither method is particularly reliable.  And much of it depends on what you've managed to aquire in the way of weapons.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I just think it's interesting that warriors advantages don't count here.<br />
<br />
Compared to shadowknights we're talking about a 15 percent AC advantage (1892 average versus 1722) and a 10 percent hit point advantage. In terms of overall mitigation, that's a 26 percent swing in favor of the warriors, yet it's not significant (warriors can take more damage between heals and take damage slower).<br />
<br />
According to this thread: http://steelwarrior.xwarzone.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=145<br />
<br />
mitigation seems linear with AC from about 1700 to 1900 - the range our 'average' people fall into.<br />
<br />
Just for comparison:<br />
http://www.eqrankings.com/?rm=list&amp;class=Ranger&amp;server=&amp;order=HP<br />
<br />
The same listing for rangers weighs in at 4984 HP average and 1517 AC. That is, for those of you keeping score at home, a 13 percent AC advantage for knights and 15 percent HP swing. Total mitigation swing ranger to knight : 30 percent.<br />
<br />
So in terms of mitigation, warriors are to knights as knights are to rangers (actually rangers are slightly worse relative to knights than warriors to knight, but close enough, eh).</div></div><hr />

Either way I doubt SoE is going to do anything about warrior agro until the next expension, where they'll introduce single groupable agro weapons that'll only take an hour of dungeon crawling to get.</div></div><hr />

I just think it's interesting that warriors advantages don't count here.<br />
<br />
<br />
Proplem is that all these advantages mean nothing in the current EQ Group Dynamics.<br />
<br />
Do any of them allow us to get aggro at extended RANGE?<br />
Do any of them allow us to pull aggro BEFORE spells start landing?<br />
Do any of them allow us to MAINTAIN aggro thru a slow cast?<br />
Do any of them allow us to maintain aggr thru a RESISTED spell? or 2 or 3 or 4?<br />
<br />
No.....<br />
<br />
Because of aggro lock - the healers needs cast only on the lockee. <br />
<br />
THIS is the motivating dynamic. no fast heals that cost more than CH, so casting on every member. Maintain slow steady heals on the MT, as long as the healer is good on mana the group rolls. VERY rarely do you ever see a group stop for any reason but healer OOM/LOM. <br />
<br />
Healers with any PoP group are the driving force, no healer and melee do not get a group. You can live without a slower, but no healer and you cannot fight effectively. It is amazing how mana inefficient ping/pong fast cleric heals are. <br />
<br />
Now, I may exagerate a little bit here, but I dont think it is too far from the truth...<br />
<br />
IF a warrior's advantages would allow us to SOLO a NON-SLOWED Pop mob to ~ 50% before needing any heals, THEN MAYBE we would have enough AC/HP/Mitigation advantage to be desireable over the knight aggro-lock.... Maybe.. but not likely. <br />
<br />
Honestly, I do not think even that would be enough, because we still have one greater contribution to the group taht would outweigh the HUGE advantage of such hp/mitigation. We make the group work slower and more inefficient. The debuffer has to wait longer, the slower must wait for aggro on warrior, DPS need to wait for assist, DPS need to slow down their attacks to not draw aggro, casters need to space out spells, not chain nuking or dotting.... <br />
<br />
We make every group we MT for  more inefficient, and when you get down to it, that is what it all boils down to. In any game with quantifiable limited values of resources, efficiency is the way to 'win' No groups can 'win' as easilly with a warrior as with a knight, until that is corrected the status quo will remain.</div></div><hr />

Yer missing the point here.... sure.. there are... but given equiv weaponry where the Warrior is forced to dual wield to gain/maintain aggro.. the Knight will outdamage the Warrior solely due to the 2 hand bonus. Yes, the average Warrior is forced to dual wield. Yes, there are weapons that a War can hold aggro with while dual wielding and do over 100 DPS, but if you keep it equivalent.. the Knight would now be using something better than a Windblade as well, so this statement would still be true: the Knight will outdamage the Warrior solely due to the 2 hand bonus.</div></div><hr />

Well, you call it 39 points less per hit, I call it 13 percent better mitigation.  Combined with the hit point advantage, it means a warrior will require 4 complete heals where a knight requires 5.<br />

I call 4 CH to 5 a fairly significant difference (and this is comparing apples to apples).  An Average 65 warrior isn't elemental flagged either - so the average hit numbers in the thread I referenced are moot as well. The fact remains that warriors give clerics 20 percent better mana efficiency - assuming this advantages scales across levels, and you want to call it insignificant.  I don't.<br />
<br />
Yes it's overshadowed by the importance of aggro lock - but that's perception and we're dealing with simple facts here.<br />

Actually, no.  Brell's stalwart shield is 330 HP and Cloak of Luclin is 279. The warrior HP advantage at the high end is 1000 HP.  Now, the effect of these buffs is more pronounced at lower levels with smaller HP and a smaller gap, but you'd have to be talking about a knight with one third the HP of the top warriors/knights for the self buffs to close the gap completely.  That equates to a level 65 with 2300 HP or so, and I'm guessing the average 65 has a few more HP than that.<br />

I don't agree that it's no longer significant, but I agree that it's now not the deciding factor in group selection.<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
Actually, just for kicks, I calculated the difference in damage from a frost bringer/red blade versus a windblade.  I used the SK droppable formulas to obtain a rough guestimate - <br />
windblade: <br />
magic number:min - 1974<br />
max:min - 4636<br />
<br />
frost bringer/red blade (~70 percent of a windblade):<br />
magic number:min - 1388<br />
max:min - 3146<br />
<br />
Of course there's fleshgrinder/red blade (~75-80 percent of a windblade):<br />
mn:min - 1550<br />
max:min - 3490<br />
<br />
Assuming no proc damage, that's still pretty grim.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Jedediah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Kiz, you're missing something here.  We mitigate damage better than knights (marginally, but we do), but it's the difference to a cleric in an exp group with a slower that really counts.  We take 15-20 seconds of unslowed damage at the minimum, if we want to establish agro.  A paladin or SK takes 0.  I'd say the difference may only be one CH, but the advantage is in the knight's favor, not the warrior's</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which may be true, but is completely meaningless when a Warrior will require 4 complete heals, the Shaman 3 fast casting heals, and the Monk 1 fast casting heal, because the Warrior couldn't hold aggro, while the Knight still only costs the 5 complete heals mentioned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, in an XP group this equates to less than one round of melee combat, not one CH difference. And.. the fact that a knight can gain aggro at range thus allowing the mob to be slowed on incoming... totally negates this small one round advantage anyway, ask the Cleric who they feel makes them more efficient, this is part of the problem.<br />
<br />
Actually, no. Brell's stalwart shield is 330 HP and Cloak of Luclin is 279. The warrior HP advantage at the high end is 1000 HP.  <br />
<br />
For a pallie:<br />
BSS 330 HP, stack with all buffs a war would want. <br />
Aura of Crusader - 342 HP, 30 AC, 3 mana / tick stack with everything<br />
Symbol of Marzin - 700 HP<br />
Bulwark of Faith - 37 AC<br />
Heric Bond - HP 360, ac 19<br />
<br />
All of the above would stack and could be self cast on a pallie for:<br />
<br />
+1402 HP, +86AC..... giving the paladin over a 400 point ADVANTAGE in HP and about equal AC looking at the classes seperately.<br />
<br />
Now, in a group with a cleric the pallie can only count BSS and AoC so more realistically he would have  +672 HP and +30 AC..<br />
<br />
Making the gap at the high end less than 350 HP difference or ONE hit (not one round of melee but one single hit).<br />
<br />
for a SK:<br />
Cloak of Luclin: 279 HP, 18 AC, 10 DS<br />
This is their only real buff, stacks with everything.<br />
Sks can steal alot of AC (100 AC) and alot of HPs from their targets but I wont count those atm.<br />
<br />
This closes the SK to less than 700 HPs of their war brethren (about one round of melee or maybe a bit more, still NOT one CH).<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't agree that it's no longer significant, but I agree that it's now not the deciding factor in group selection. <br />
<br />
If it is no longer a deciding factor... how can it NOT be insignificant?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Given the rates of mana regen these days, which renders this distinction nearly meaningless, would you give up your ENTIRE spellbook (including fd and HT) for this difference + defensive?<br />
<br />
Anyway, the 4/5 ratio isn't even real, since clerics are blowing extra mana healing warriors fighting unslowed mobs, and healing other people in the party getting hit when the warrior loses aggro. We have plenty of testimony from clerics that in fact warriors are NOT more mana efficient, and they certainly aren't 20% more mana efficient. That's a total farce.</div></div><hr />

Agreed about aggro, but remove aggro and warriors retain a 20 percent mitigation advantage. Call it one round of combat, call it X HP, I look at it as this: in the time that a warrior will take enough damage to require 4 complete heals, a knight will require 5. However long that period of time is.<br />

<br />
Because we're talking about two kinds of significance.  Apples to apples, the better mitigation is significant. In terms of desirability for groups, it's not significant - because of other factors being more important. If better mitigation was the only factor in deciding on groups, knights would never get groups. Since it isn't, and snap aggro is considered massivly more important, there's still a meaningful mitigation gap, but it doesn't matter to the clerics and shaman picking from the sea of melees for groups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What this says, is there is still a gap, but it doesn't matter because it is not large enough to matter to the healer.<br />
<br />
That is exactly what we are saying, we do not (well, most wars don't, I sure don't) want Knights to be nerfed. However, we do want something to appeal to the people deciding on the makeup of an XP group.  <br />
<br />
and just for the record....<br />
<br />
I advocate increasing HP and AC of war innately  to increase the gap to a point where it does factor in group selection and perhaps adding a message to taunt to let people a) know yer using it (hehe), and b) know if it worked or not. I would also LOVE to see a bit more range added to taunt.<br />
<br />
Now, the taunt changes would benefit Knights as well and really not change the power of a warriors taunt except that he would not have to be kissing the mob hes killing to taunt it.</div></div><hr />

Generally speaking...in my expereince, SK's tend to be better groupmates for warriors than Paladins, as SK's tend to have more roles and for some reason, when grouped with a warrior, don't feel that they're obliged to flaunt their aggro generation and tankability, but tend to understand that the best of all worlds is for them to act as &quot;aggro managers&quot; rather than fighting with warriors.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Just wanted to point out a few things.<br />
<br />
1. In the damage comparison, you force the warriors to duel wield which lowers their DPS compared to the knights 2h weapons. I have no problem with this, except that all but 3 of the knight magelos you use for comparison use 1h+shield to boost their stats. Only 1 warrior used something other than duel wield (also 1h+shield) but his stats would be similar with a second weapon equiped. So for starters, HP/AC numbers are artificially inflated for the knights because they would normally be weilding a 2h weapon which has considerably worse stats than 1h+shield.<br />
<br />
2. When you compare AC, you force all 3 classes into the &quot;exact same gear&quot;. Frankly this is horse shit. Just because a war, a pally, and an SK CAN wear the exact same armor doesn't mean they DO wear the same armor. If this where the case then pallys and SKs would be sacrificing a ton of mana to get warrior like stats. You need to look at real gear choices and see what the AC difference is there. My dwarven warrior doesn't wear any of the same gear that my dwarven pally friend wears because we make gear choices based on different values. I care about HP/AC while my pally friend also has to consider WIS/MANA when he chooses gear. If you take the same #15-20 magelos you use in your comparison, the difference is very apparent (note that SK/Pally numbers are inflated by 1h+shield use when they use 2h in practice).<br />
<br />
<br />
SK	HP	AC<br />
15	6836	1708<br />
16	6824	1707<br />
18	6818	1792<br />

19	7792	1900<br />
20	7769	1881<br />
AVG	7793	1893<br />
<br />
As you can see, the warrior has on average a 97AC advantage over the pally and 171AC advantage over the SK.<br />
<br />
3. Of course all of these advantages a warrior has are moot, because as it has already been mentioned, no advantage matters if preception dictates the decision. In this case, Pallys and SKs are precieved to be better EXP group tanks so they will be chosen over a warrior in many cases.<br />
<br />
However, I think this is how it should be. Before you get your panties in a wad let me explain why. When it comes to playing EQ, there are 3 areas that matter to most of the population - grouping, soloing, and raiding. Every class has their strengths and weaknesses regarding those 3 areas and all 3 of those areas need to be considered when balancing a class. This is why I believe that warriors are unlikely to get any significant changes to their grouping or soloing abilities.<br />
<br />
Warriors are far and away the better raid tank. This has never been disputed. In the majority of cases when raiding level appropriate content (pally tanking vindi is a dumb example, my wizard can tank vindi) there is no choice in who tanks. The warrior tanks because no other class is even remotely capable. There are very few areas of the game that a class has a complete monopoly on and this is one of them. In exchange for this, warriors have to sacrifice elsewhere - in this case they give up group tanking to knights. Which incidently, knights do not have a monopoly on. If your raid does not have a warrior, raid is off. If your group does not have an SK/Pally, a warrior will do just fine. And in some cases depending on equipment, the group may be better off with a warrior whether they think so or not.<br />
<br />
This is the root of the entire problem. For warriors to get any type of significant changes to make them more group friendly, they would have to give up something else - their raid tank monopoly. In order to do this, the entire game would have to be re-tuned because raid mobs are tuned with a warrior tanking in mind.<br />
<br />
READ THIS BEFORE YOU FLAME!!! <br />
While I AGREE that warriors should get some upgrades to make them more desirable to a group, I think it is too late in the game to make sweeping changes to make that happen. The single change that could make warriors better group tanks without calling for many changes across the board would be to increase the effectiveness of taunt - which would also benefit Pallys and SKs. It's a catch 22.</div></div><hr />

Clerics are extremely necessary to a raid.  I've seen far more raids cancelled due to not having enough Clerics rather than not having a single Warrior (because frankly in many situations you need only one, additional Warriors are there only if things go wrong).  Using your logic Clerics, who don't solo very well btw, should in fact be one of the least group desirable of the Priest classes, because they are one of the most desired of the Priest classes for raids.  We know this isn't true, they are very desired for both.  Now unless you're also advocating that Clerics be nerfed in such a way that they no longer retain their group desirability then your arguement is basically hog wash.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think this has to be true.  Wizards put out some pretty sick DPS in raids, and yet they can also duplicate that role in XP groups.  Just because there is more people in a raid doesn't mean that it's essentially any different than an XP group with more people.  <br />

In fact, EVERY class that has a role on raids can duplicate that role in an XP group, EXCEPT warriors.  That's bullshit.</div></div><hr />

In the majority of cases when raiding level appropriate content (pally tanking vindi is a dumb example, my wizard can tank vindi) there is no choice in who tanks. The warrior tanks because no other class is even remotely capable.<br />
<br />
Wrong. Warriors are not the best tanks on raids. Warriors are the best tanks on the BIG mobs in a raid, anything that requires defensive. They have their glory for 5 minutes, 15 miuntes, or however long it is, but that's it. <br />
Hybrids are far and away better choices for every mob before and after that single named mob, due to their FAR superior aggro control. They're also far and away better choices as CC tanks.<br />
So while the warriors get dusted off, and the several warriors fight over which one gets to fight the mob, the only time the hybrids aren't useful is DURING that fight. And even then, they're useful with fast heals, LoH, Terris, controlling adds, and the like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Bleh. had my post all typed up and my boss walked in. Here goes again.<br />
<br />
We know this isn't true, they are very desired for both. Now unless you're also advocating that Clerics be nerfed in such a way that they no longer retain their group desirability then your arguement is basically hog wash.<br />
Clerics are tops in raids, but they can be replaced by a shaman or druid in ANY experience group. For less than full groups, clerics are the least desirable healer because they lack utility. Clerics also have little to no soloability. Shaman on the other hand are good across the board, while not being the best in any one area. Of course druids are excellent soloers, good in groups, but pretty unnecessary on raids. So my theory holds true, like it or not. Each of the classes gives something up to be better in other areas.<br />
<br />
I don't think this has to be true. Wizards put out some pretty sick DPS in raids, and yet they can also duplicate that role in XP groups.<br />
While it is true that wizards are a good group DPS class, the PRECEPTION says otherwise. More often than not, a wizard will be passed over for a monk or a rogue when a group needs DPS. If groups had more group desireablility then people would not be as likely to pick another class over them, but to give wizards more groupability, we would have to give up some soloing or some raiding ability. This is the EXACT problem warriors have.<br />
<br />
In fact, EVERY class that has a role on raids can duplicate that role in an XP group, EXCEPT warriors. That's bullshit.<br />
You're kidding right? Last I checked, warriors where pretty capable of tanking in an exp group.<br />
<br />
So when do we get solo ability? <br />
I didn't say you had to be good at it, only that it needs to be considered. Warriors are bad soloers, but then so are pallys. SKs are ok soloers but they are primarily a grouping class as well.<br />
<br />
ONE warrior is needed on a raid... <br />
If there is a red herring related to warriors and raiding, this is it. Warriors are needed ONE AT A TIME on a raid. I don't know about your guild, but we like to have additional warriors in case oh, one dies or god forbid we want to tank more than 1 mob at a time. A raid with 1 warrior is as gimped as a raid lacking clerics.<br />
<br />
Since I was a little vague in my first post, let me be more specific about what I mean about raiding/soling/grouping -<br />
<br />
Warriors are the ONLY choice to tank level appropriate raid mobs (a pally tanking vindi is a dumb example, my wizard can tank vindi). They also make the best tank mezzers in a raid situation since agro is not really a consideration. Warriors are also good exp group tanks, but they give up the agro advantage to pallys and SKs. Warrios have little level approriate solo skills.<br />
<br />
Paladins are the excellent exp group tanks. They have marginally better agro than SKs and they have more utility with the ability to rez, heal, and buff. In exhange, they give up their raid desireability. They do have some utility in that they can tank some mobs in a pinch and they can help with heals. Raids can function at normal capacity without any paladins present. Paladins also have very little level appropriate solo ability. They are marginally better than warriors since they can heal themselves, but don't expect to see any pallys soloing blues with any consistency at all.<br />
<br />
SKs are very good group tanks, only a step behind palladins since they can also maintain very good agro with spells. Again, much like the pally, SKs have little raid desireablitly. While they can contribute to a raid, they are in no way indisposable. Again, a raid can operate at full capacity with no SKs present and due to them having less utility than paladins, have even less raid desirabliliy than the other 2 tank classes. Sks do have some soloability due to their ability to agro kite. While not really efficient or a particularly viable method of gaining exp, their ability to solo is better than both paladins and warriors.<br />
<br />
Again, please understand that I agree that warriors need a slight boost in group desirability. I do think that a more reliable taunt would go a long way to helping warriors. While it would help SKs and pallys become less mana dependent, their main source of agro would still come from spells so the change would not have as big an impact as it does on warriors. If the taunt button was effective as much as 60-75% of the time I think warriors would be able to keep agro realiably enough to make some ground on the SKs and pallys in the area of grouping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Warriors are the best tanks on the BIG mobs in a raid, anything that requires defensive.<br />
That's the whole point. Forget about that mob and why bother raiding? Plus, agro control is largely irrelevant when it comes to tank mezzing. Plus I would argue that any trash mob on the way to a raid target dies too fast to call an SK or pally a better tank. In those cases a rogue could tank because the mob dies too fast. On any mob that matters, the warriors will be tanking - and this includes mobs on the way to a raid target. Basically on a raid, if the mob in question does not NEED a warrior tanking, then it is basically irrelevant who tanks it.<br />

<br />
Raiding isn't the whole game.  it can't be.  you still need to Xp group to get level's and AA's.  For a lot of people in the game, grouping is all there is...they may never even see a raid target alive.  I understand that's the way it is, and I don't disagree with that fact, but I don't think the game should be balanced that way.  Having to make 5 different characters just so I have a character that can be good at the different things I do is kind of crap.  People shouldn't have to have a warrior for raids and a necro to solo when they want to, and a druid to do their tradeskills and shit like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So that 15 minutes of glory for the warrior is supposed to justify being passed over consistently for XP groups? Damn. Well, if you're being that judgemental, then I guess soloers never need groups. Clerics need no XP group role. Hybrids need no raid role cause they're the tank of choice for groups<br />
<br />
Plus, agro control is largely irrelevant when it comes to tank mezzing.<br />
<br />
Bull. What's the ponit of trying to tank a mob if you can't get it to pay attention to you? If the slow has the mob jumping the caster Any mob that needs CC that's actually difficult to tank due to actually hitting hard needs the spike of aggro to cover the slow that needs to be landed ASAP. Knights are the ones to provide that spike. I think you're talking about several expansion old content that 65 and AA's and new spells has trivialized. That stuff CAN be tanked by anything... cause it's trivial.<br />
<br />
Plus I would argue that any trash mob on the way to a raid target dies too fast to call an SK or pally a better tank. In those cases a rogue could tank because the mob dies too fast. On any mob that matters, the warriors will be tanking - and this includes mobs on the way to a raid target. Basically on a raid, if the mob in question does not NEED a warrior tanking, then it is basically irrelevant who tanks it.<br />
<br />
<br />
The point that the mob dies too fast is only when you have either a: way too much of a force for the raid either in numbers or gear (IE doing NToV with 50 level 65's), or b: are doing stuff that's several expansions old. In anything with any level of difficulty involved, my point is valid. I'm sure warriors can tank adds in anything up to and including Ssra, and some of the lower tier Planes. They just don't HIT hard or fast. Losing aggro on those is no big deal, either. But anything above that were the mobs are actually going to eat people when aggro control is lost, and it becomes a very big issue.<br />
<br />
My point is valid. Warriors are not the tank of choice for raids as a whole. Warriors are the tank of choice for the 15 minutes out of the raid where a big mob needs to be tanked. The rest of the time, it's the hybrids that are the tank of choice.</div></div><hr />

Defensive/evasive last 3 minutes. refreshes 6 min later...<br />

How many boss mobs last longer than that in PoP? how about 6 minutes? 9 minutes? these are not the SoL 30 minute fights here, so you are looking at MAX 3 warriors?<br />
<br />
When clearing trash, the MT usually hits f8 calls assist, doesnt really matter who is getting hit, all he does is controls the target for all the casters...<br />

<br />
At any rate, my position is that warriors need to be given some sort of aggro generation capabilities on demand, an ability that is innate to the class and not utterly dependant upon gear, as it stands now. Then, EB needs to be removed from the game. <br />
<br />
This aggro generation must be inferior to knights, of course, but if knights tank 90% as well as a warrior, the warrior must generate aggro on demand 90% as well as a knight..</div></div><hr />

No, I never said that. A mob needing a warrior tanking does not mean the warrior has to go defenive, it means the mob hits hard enough that a warriors HP/AC advantage is needed to make it efficient for heals. In many cases, a warrior offtanking a mob will only get 1 healer.<br />
<br />
How many boss mobs last longer than that in PoP? how about 6 minutes? 9 minutes? these are not the SoL 30 minute fights here, so you are looking at MAX 3 warriors?<br />
How many bosses last longer than defenisive? Um, like all of them when you get to tier 3+ except Coirnav. Plus, the majority of PoP encounters REQUIRE more than 1 mob to be tanked at a time due to the dynamics of the encounter.<br />
<br />
How many times you pull 2-3 boss mobs? that would be the only serious reason you may need more than 1 MT<br />
This is not limited to bosses. Many times you don't get the option on how many heavy hitters you get in camp. You tank how ever many mobs you get and often times that is 2 or 3 or sometimes 5 or 6. Plus in many cases you have to tank those mobs for a long time. This is particularly where warriors shine. While another tank may be able to tank the mob, a warrior will be more efficient to heal, and when a mob has to be tanked for 5 or 10 minutes while the rest of the raid works on something else, you need all the efficiency you can get. When the 4/5 cheal ratio is expanded to 20/25 you can see how much of a difference it makes to the single healer charged with keeping the tank up.<br />
<br />
Having to make 5 different characters just so I have a character that can be good at the different things I do is kind of crap.<br />
Class lines are blurred enough, you want a character that is good at everything? Are you serious? Why should my wizard tank as good as your warrior? Why should your warrior nuke as good as my wizard? Why should some dumb ogre (no offence ogres, I love you guys) be as good as an enchanter at jewelry craft?<br />

If yer inflating yer magelo to compare prick sizes /shrug... nothing I can do about that and I am sure its is going on for the other knights and warriors as well...<br />
<br />
2. When you compare AC, you force all 3 classes into the &quot;exact same gear&quot;. Frankly this is horse shit. <br />
<br />
Well, warriors could fight butt ass naked and have less AC as well. Your argument is on based on gear and itemization here, and to some extent I agree with you, however, there are a great many more War and Knight useable items with mana wis int on them than war only ones, just look at the SSRA armor drops alone.... heck.. alot of the velious+ gear is ALL/ALL or dang close to it... yes, I agree.. itemization is a bit skewed, should be more class specific items for all classes and less all/all, but hey.. hindsight is always 20/20 right?<br />
<br />
My example was to show that given the same armor we have the same AC, that is all, the magelos I posted above support this as well as the magelos for my own guild. maybe you need to query some warriors in your guild??<br />
<br />
When it comes to playing EQ, there are 3 areas that matter to most of the population - grouping, soloing, and raiding. Every class has their strengths and weaknesses regarding those 3 areas and all 3 of those areas need to be considered when balancing a class. This is why I believe that warriors are unlikely to get any significant changes to their grouping or soloing abilities. <br />
<br />
When considering class balancing you by definition have to look at the classes seperately, in groups, and for large scale raid encounters. With that statement I agree 100%. <br />
<br />
Above we have looked at them seperately. Now lets examine a Warrior and a Paladin in the descibed three &quot;roles&quot;... shall we?<br />
<br />
Warrior:<br />
<br />
Solo -  virtually non-existent beyond level 20 ish, with the correct (*read as expensive and somewhat rare) gear can solo somewhat up to level 60, usually only light blues and at very high risk to themselves and others in the zone.<br />
<br />
Groups: - Third choice for tank slot in an XP group, brings nothing other than tankability to the group, if not tanking can do decent DPS (but why are they in group if not tanking?). Are usually decent pullers if the group has CC and doesnt mind getting 2 on some pulls (or more). But it is not efficient to have your tank pull so wont often pull.<br />
<br />
Raids: - The 2 or 3 best equipped highest level warriors at the raid are essential, they get to blow their 3 min of fame (defensive or evasive depending on the boss mob). The rest bring less to raids than they do to groups.<br />
<br />
Paladin:<br />
<br />
Solo - Easily can find mobs to solo up to 60, excels against undead in particular. Downtime is not too bad since they can heal, root, etc. In fact, looking at PoN it seems solo is still viable after 60, and its entirely possible to solo yellow cons up to 60. The gear here a pallie needs to solo is a decent weapon and armor.<br />
<br />
Group - Knights are the first choice for XP groups. Paladins bring Fast heals, Stuns, Guaranteed Aggro control  even at range, rez, limited CC in form of root. BSS group buff for +330 HPs for everyone (but maybe rangers hehe). They too can pull and usually dont for same reasons that warriors dont.<br />
<br />
Raids - LoH chains, BSS, Chain stun are three things that make paladins very desireable on raids... Paladins make decent if not near ideal RT tanks as well. Ninja Rezs during long fights... Coupled with the group heals for AE targets paladins are desired on raids, they may not have as clearly a defined role as the one MT, but a well times LoH that gets the pallie aggro instead of a cleric can (and has) mean the difference on a raid win vs raid loose. Ok, most raids wont &quot;nbot happen&quot; if a paladin isn't there, but in my experience... its usually a matter of the number of clerics as to whether or not we can call a raid in my guild, not warriors.<br />
<br />
<br />
So...... lets recap shall we... lets grade each on a scale of 0 to 5 total them and compare results<br />
<br />
Wars, can't solo well if at all(0), Third rate choice for XP groups(2), A few have well defined raid roles(5). Gives us a total of 7 for the MT warriors, the others get a 3 on raid just for being warriors for a total of 5.<br />
<br />
Pallies, Can solo fairly well (3), first rate choice for XP groups (5), have raid roles and can help contribute to a raid (3). Give them a total of 11<br />
<br />
Anyway, I know you cannot really grade these areas very well and it is subjective, but I just wanted to point out the main flaw in this line of reasoning... discounting all tanks classes, many classes excell at 2 or more of these categories and are still viable in the 3rd one as well (mages, druids, clerics, shaman, heck.. shaman are great at all 3, so are chanters.) Thus I think this line of thought does nothing but point out that warriors have yet again.. been found lacking... <br />
<br />
pally tanking vindi is a dumb example, my wizard can tank vindi <br />
<br />
I'd love to see that (cause I doubt most wizards could channel through vindi's melee to maintain aggro lock thus causing cleric death and a wipe). Yer missing the point.. that example was to show that a Knight need not even hit the mob to guarantee aggro lock. Not to show that vindi is a fairly easy &quot;boss mob.&quot;<br />
<br />
For warriors to get any type of significant changes to make them more group friendly, they would have to give up something else  <br />
<br />
As I stated (way) above.. most wars have ZERO issues with this. In fact defensive is what led us to the point we are at now. I advocate getting rid of defensive entirely and just placing warriors on their own mitigation tables and giving us a bit more AC and HPs. I also think if you compare the limited &quot;roles&quot; you have defined above you will see there is still room for improvement with out altering the relationship a war has with his knight brethren or altering the &quot;raid roles&quot; in any way.<br />
<br />
I would also like to say, I really do like Furor's ideas (just finished reading that monstor of a post). The concept works well and solves alot of current issues, the specifics may need some balancing but the concept is awesome and greatly enhances the fun factor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">you believe anyone exping turns down a cleric as healer if they have/have a slot for, a slower/buffer? <br />
Huh? If you are asking if I would turn a cleric down for a group if we need a slower, then yes, if we have a healer that is doing the job why would I add a cleric when I need a slower?<br />
<br />
What I said is that clerics can be replaced by druids or shaman in any exp group, which is absolutely true. In any regular experience group when considering equally geared priests, any one of the three will do. As a matter of fact, depending on the group make up, you might be better off with a druid or shaman as healer. There are plenty of situations where this would be the case, I don't think I need to outline all of them. The only time a cleric is the superior healer in a group is when you are fighting something that hits hard enough that complete heals are the only efficient method of keeping the tank up. If a druid or shaman can keep the tank alive without running in to mana problems then they are most likely better for the job because of their added utility over a cleric.</div></div><hr />

I am not blaming you, just pointing out that the AC/HP numbers you are using for your example are going to be inflated for knights since they would normally be using 2h, whereas the warrior magelos listed their best agro set up since that tends to be 2x 1h.<br />
<br />
My example was to show that given the same armor we have the same AC, that is all, the magelos I posted above support this as well as the magelos for my own guild. maybe you need to query some warriors in your guild??<br />
I used the same magelos you did. The fact is that when knights and warriors choose gear, they do not choose the same gear - as is shown by the huge disparity in AC across the magelos you chose to use as an example.<br />
<br />
I'd love to see that (cause I doubt most wizards could channel through vindi's melee to maintain aggro lock thus causing cleric death and a wipe). <br />
Instant cast manaless debuff. I only mention this because it's been done. Not by me, but I am sure I could raid buffed.<br />
<br />
As I stated (way) above.. most wars have ZERO issues with this.<br />
Here is where we agree. The only problem with this is that it would require extensive re-tuning from one end of the game to the other, which is unlikely from a financial and manpower standpoint on SOEs part.<br />
<br />
I'll have to go see what Furor has in mind, I usually agree with his ideas.<br />
<br />
When 80% of the game is xping in the Elementals then MAYBE just MAYBE you may have a point...<br />
The statement I made applies to all levels of the game. It actually applies a lot less the higher you get. If I am grouping in PoFire then I would prefer a cleric healer, but if I am playing my 34 monk I would much rather have a druid or shaman healing because they bring a lot more to the group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*nods in agreement* I love playing my warrior but if i cant get a grouping I do not have the option to go SOLO so needless to say when 'people' start prefering Pallies and SK's to a warrior for a tank it becomes a bit of a bitch to lvl :) just my 2cp though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Kazzuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">I used the same magelos you did. The fact is that when knights and warriors choose gear, they do not choose the same gear - as is shown by the huge disparity in AC across the magelos you chose to use as an example. <br />
<br />
I would hardly call a difference of 97 AC UNBUFFED a &quot;Huge Disparity&quot; considering that is a reduction of at best 10 HPs a hit on average if you are fighting mobs that have not already capped your mitigation based on your ac and the mobs you are fightings attack rating. Thus in many XP groups both Knight and Warriors whose mageloes were used in the above example have hit the &quot;softcap for that mob&quot; thus any additional AC is wasted and meaningless. <br />
<br />
The AC Myth is pretty well debunked above and further negated by the knights ability to limit required healing to themselves by keeping perfect aggro lock as well as their ability to gain aggro at range allowing the slower to slow safely on incoming. The knight as a tank does not need to tank the mob unslowed while building aggro thus the group will require less healing overall. Less to the tank initially and less to others since no one else should take any damage.<br />
<br />
Instant cast manaless debuff. I only mention this because it's been done. Not by me, but I am sure I could raid buffed. <br />
<br />
I thought they nerfed the staff of temperate flux for this very reason? Or did they just make it worn only?? Hmm.. have to log in my wizzy now and look....<br />
<br />
Gawd.. I'd hate to have spell effects on while a wizzy chain clicked away a 6 point fire/cold  debuff to keep aggro....:eek: <br />
<br />
If the staff of temp flux still works as it used too.. then perhaps.. with adequate healing and a wizard buffed/geared enough to live though a round of melee. Just have to make sure yer dps knows to not pull aggro off the wizzy.  he wont get it back hehe.</div></div><hr />

No, you have clearly stated that Warriors have an advantage in raiding that justifies their being screwed in groups.  Yet Clerics  are clearly not screwed for groups, nor are you claiming they should be.  So your point is complete bullshit.  k, thx, drive through.</div></div><hr />

Solo - Easily can find mobs to solo up to 60, excels against undead in particular. Downtime is not too bad since they can heal, root, etc. In fact, looking at PoN it seems solo is still viable after 60, and its entirely possible to solo yellow cons up to 60. The gear here a pallie needs to solo is a decent weapon and armor.<br />

<br />
I got that idea by skimming the pallies of norrath MB... reading through the posts a bit more thouroughly this afternoon perhaps yellow cons are a bit much.. dark blues are certainly within your reach though, so I retract that and make it dark blue cons.<br />
<br />
Here is but one of many posts on pallies of narrath boards about soloing.... some are worse than this, some better, most seem to say if ya know what yer doing and have a 1 ratio weapon or better.. yer cool.<br />
<br />
<br />
From Pallies of Norrath MB:<br />
Hmm I thot my pally @ lvl 52 sucked so bad , i made him my bazaar mule &amp; leveled my monk up to 54. I took my lvl 54 monk outfitted with with lvl 60 type gear to solo in Solb &amp; KC.<br />
I realized in Kc, as the doggies slapped me around, that my pally did waaayyy better in there.<br />
so I sold all the monk Uber gear, &amp; outfitted my pally with cultural armor or better, 34 % waist haste &amp; my 2 tined corpse pitchfork. WoW the blue doggies (sentries &amp; guardians) i could slaughter with ease &amp; actuaully take on a sentry/guardian combo with root parking. <br />
How was all this possible ? I'll tell ya, KEI &amp; liberal amounts of ethreal cleansing. I love that spell 400 hp over 4 ticks , while i fight &amp; rarely gets inturrupted as I cast it. With self haste &amp; fully buffed , i was hitting 1100-1200 ac 3300 - 3700 hp. I can easily solo Nox in solb, 3 bats, or an ldc with one or two bats. My monk could never do this even tho he had a Fungi 1100 ac &amp; lots of hp(31% waiste haste with entwood/SoS combo)(2 bats was his max). the nox or ldc poison just hurt him bad.<br />
<br />
In all that soloing i rarely have to LOH myself, i prefer to root park &amp; heal with heal spell &amp; ethreal cleansing, assuming I have a KEI up. without Kei I could not accomplish this without lots of down time beween fights to regen mana. <br />
<br />
So at lvl 54 now, I know my pally can solo, way better than my monk. So i have made my Monk the Bazaar biatch. <br />
<br />
There are actually 3 things that put my pally over my monk in solo capability imho. ethreal cleansing, KEI, &amp; self haste spell.<br />
Also having a weapon beyond a 1 ratio like the 2 tined corpse pitchfork or a windblade( which I also carry) contibutes as well.<br />
<br />
We pallies have a lot of tools out there to make us good at a lot things, put it all together with skill &amp; we can be great. Before KEI, ethreal cleansing, windblade &amp; self haste, we pallies sucked the hind tit always. Today is waayy different.<br />

No, you stated warriors are screwed in groups. I said warriors give up some grouping, mainly taunt to knights. Warriors are not screwed in groups, they are more than capable of tanking for a group. I also stated that warriors need a bump to get them closer to knights to balance things out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was no such thing as KEI when I was leveling in the 50s. Obviously things are different now.<br />

You also missed the part where he mentioned the mobs he was fighting. He was fighting low 40s mobs at level 52. I wouldn't really call that high blues since the lowest blue to a 52 is level 39.</div></div><hr />

Yes, KEI allowed alot of people ot never really learn what their class is capable of, unfortunately, but that was but one example fomr the PoN message boards... you guys have several great threads there about where to solo and what to solo... he was killing those &quot;dark blues&quot; (yes, they are dark blue, not light blue, which is what I said) for efficiency reasons... You guys also have posts about killing white and yellow cons.. after reading them I realized they were more of the &quot;how to&quot; &quot;how do I&quot; or the bragging rights type posts and not something any sane pallie would attempt to do regularly for XP, thus I reassed my above statements. It still does not change the fact that a pallie can solo better then a warrior by a fairly large degree and with much less in the way of (expensive and rare) equipment.<br />
<br />
Many of the solo posts are fairly old as well, before &quot;KEI&quot; was a factor...<br />
<br />
Yes, alot of things are different now.... some for the better, some for the worse. We just want to see &quot;some for the better&quot; for warriors as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The current problems are mostly with 60+ (PoP), doing pre 60 stuff to build your case really doesnt apply tothe problem. If you take stuff pre 60, then you can throw out most of the problems as well (lack of snap aggro gets casters/clerics killed, pre 60/PoP nothing kills fast enuff for this to really matter)<br />
<br />
Yes Pals can Solo Past 60, about as well as warriors could solo pre 60, crappy xp, not fun, doesnt come *close* to compare to grouping, nothing like caster solo.<br />
<br />
If your gunna nitpick one side your gunna need to nitpick the other side, I dont know the numbers for the difference in Evasion between Pal/Knight and War, but the commonly accepted one around here is 2.5% Which makes the *effective tanking* difference from the top tanks (10k+ buffed) around 200 HP more, which while isnt too much, certainly something to consider, espically if some of paladins stuff is nitpicked. (Yes I realize that this doesnt help against AE's and Spell damage, which is quite prevalent in POP)<br />
<br />
Most warriors can last at least a fair amount past disc for POP mobs on a good day, so saying 3 minutes of glory is sorta stupid, before someone says if a mob can be tanked easily without disc  then you dont need warrior, your forgeting how much the disc helps during the start before debuffs are going in,  + the 3 minutes of near &quot;Guarenteed&quot; is far better then 0 Minutes the  Knight would have.  But yes on the same token, the tanks will die, so saying only need one per raid is also stupid.<br />
<br />
I see many 60+ warriors in low teired guilds with the Xanamech 1hb, so saying most warriors need to go to far inferior Velious taunt weapons (Wavecrasher/Frostbringer) Doing /who Warrior 60/65 on an average day, most of the warriors had a Xanamech/SoD/BoC/HG/BF/BoW/SEWS/Good ratioed taunt weapon (14/20 did) Yes it was a random time, and is hardly scienctific, but its no more sciencetific then the &quot;40% dps loss via taunt weapons&quot; that has been posed in this thread.<br />
<br />
Counting total amount of HP Pal can buff is sorta meaningless, when is the last time you grouped consistently w/o a Cleric/Druid or Cleric/Druid buffs?<br />
<br />
If warriors are doing quotes from level 55 Paladins to prove their points about how Knights are unbalanced in PoP, then surely if I quote level 65 warriors that say everything is alright then SURELY everything is alright... <br />
<br />
No Of course not<br />
<br />
Building case's through quotes that have little to no impact on the &quot;real&quot; issues is sorta lame.<br />
<br />
Of course paladins/Sks are gunna have shields equipped to max hp, during tanking your gunna want to be max HP/AC, and paladins 1h Melee + Spells is enough to Hold aggro.</div></div><hr />

If you are going to post this, stop mentioning raiding which some of us don't do.

I think you should let the Warriors that go after these types of weapons DAILY decide just how easy they are to get... the average warrior will not obtain that weapon, end of question. Yes, 40% was a &quot;fudged&quot; number for example purposes, but it also fits real world parses, even the raw numbers based on ratios support this. No one has argued this point since, except you. <br />
<br />
Bottom line, Knights using 2 handers and keeping aggro no problem through spells will hands down outdamage equivalent warriors dual wielding aggro weapons and praying for a proc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Counting total amount of HP Pal can buff is sorta meaningless, when is the last time you grouped consistently w/o a Cleric/Druid or Cleric/Druid buffs?<br />

<br />
What part of balancing do you not understand, you have to look at parties in all scenarios, grouped and ungrouped..., Even with a cleric the Paladin will at a minimum get the brells line plus AoTC which closes any HP advantage a warrior had... considerably.<br />

I have been on raids where the MT has been a pally or SK several times , the Pallies LOH and SK's HT has been a huge reason why on a specific end game mob they hold better agro.<br />
<br />
If the raid is targeted at one specific boss mob , then agro holding is a reason to choose a MT , a Pally with LOH up has so much more effective HP available and the SK 's Nuke like HT is again a huge agro generator , what can we do ? we can AE taunt after a few seconds to grab agro back but Warriors unfortunately are becoming slowly and steadily less then a must have on raids <br />
please I am not trying to say we will be out of a job soon , but the way classes are balanced at the moment is making warriors less and less tenable <br />
 I like to play my Warrior , but I know that I am a second choice in EXP groups , but I still cant solo anything that will give me EXP, so without EXP groups what is a warrior to do ? spend entire gamelife waiting for raids ? where we hopefully have some use still (when unmezzable adds need controlling )at least until SOE decides to do some real class balancing <br />

<br />
If one was to check aggro weapon setups for warriors between level 60 and 65, I believe the vast majority would be using BoC and another 1Hdr. The reduction in DPS when the average Warrior MT's is real. The damage taken as a result of recieving more repostes is real.<br />
<br />
PoTime is not the only tier where the Warrior survivability advantage all but disappears. The best pre-planar armor includes items like Great Shadow Platemail. At the level of doing Seru, Emp, VT, etc. the vast majority of the &quot;best&quot; items can and are worn by all 3 classes. Do Knights have lower AC and HP's? Probably, but it's more than made up by fewer repostes, spells, and the ability to slow on incoming. Knight survivability near equivilence exists at all levels of the game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Boleslav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">Wandor,  you will be flamed.  You were doing so well until you tried to use the raid vs. exp group angle.  This is so old, tired, and inappropriate that you deserve a few flames for bringing it up again.  <br />
<br />
I like the intent of the initial poster, but it is hard to remove bias from any attempt at objectivity.  Each area is skewed just a bit toward the Warrior point of view.  Of course my observations will inevitabely be skewed toward the Paladin point of view, but I present them for balance.  I don't know much about Shadow Knight issues, so I won't pretend to discuss them.<br />
<br />
In the skill cap discussion, there is a 27 point difference in Offense most weapons skills.  Yet when you discuss the implications of the differences the discussion suddenly revolves around a 10 point difference (points 240 to 250).  I feel comfortable saying that using comparable gear, and in the same situation Paladins do a shade better than 80% of the damage of a Warrior.  <br />
<br />
I agree that Warriors lose DPS tanking, although the selection of aggro proccing weapons is increasing a bit.  Paladins also lose DPS when tanking as well.  Perhaps not as much as Warriors lose, but still a significant amount.  I think the 60 DPS for a level 65 Warrior with a few AAs and level appropriate gear is a bit low.<br />
<br />
Wandor is dead on with his comments about most Paladin magelos having 1H + Shield.  This adds at least 100 HP to each of those Paladin's  magelos.<br />
<br />
When discussing buffs, the only buff that really should be considered an advantage for Paladins is Aura of the Crusader (350 HP, 42 AC, 3 Mana Regen).  Brell's Stalwart Shield can be cast on anyone, is readily available, and lasts a long time.  Warriors will certainly have it on during raids, and may have it on for a lot of their experience grouping too.  With that in mind, take the 953 HP average difference between the top Warriors and Paldins, add 100 because the Paladin is almost certainly not using 1H+shield like in those uber magelos.  Then subtract 350 for Aura of the crusader.  We are left with a difference of 753 HP in buffed hit points.<br />
<br />
With all that said, I agree with many of the opinions expressed here.  In most experience situations, the Warriors advantages in HP/AC/Mitigation/DPS do not overcome the Paladin's strengths due to spells.  I just wanted to point out how some of the numbers in the initial post seemed a bit skewed to me.  <br />

<br />
/SALUTE<br />
<br />
And I'll congratulate the rest of you for keeping it reasonably civil.<br />
<br />
Ok, some observations of my own.  I am a 65 warrior, pre-NToV gear.  I have the Xana hammer and Ancient Prismatic.  I use my blue epic to touch off the primal.  My gear is here:<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=104898 <br />
<br />
My gear is on par, at least, with any tank in my guild.<br />
<br />
Some points, randomly taken from the previous pages:<br />
<br />
1. Warriors between 60 and 65 usually DON'T have a BoC.  Battleblade, that was a silly statement.<br />
<br />
2. For all my armor and skills, I don't seem to notice the damage I take being mitigated much at all.  I have to wonder if it does anything at all...<br />
<br />
3. The utility of a feigning SK, or a stunning/healing pally, should not be overlooked.  Warriors have ZERO utility.<br />
<br />
4. Our entire class is built around /defensive.  But I don't use it during exp groups.  So I am fundamentally gimped.  The point made above about our raid role not existing in exp groups is spot on.<br />
<br />
5. Unlike Knights, warriors have little on-demand ability to get aggro.  There is Area Taunt, and boy do I like it. Once every 15m, or so.<br />
<br />
6. Warriors don't have many choices during a fight.  Makes them kinda boring.  The knights can be doing many interesting, useful things.<br />
<br />
7. Warriors may have a better damage table than Knights, but once you add those crazy &quot;inverted&quot; knight weapons (dam &gt; del) the knights simply out damage the warrior.  Windblades are a TON of money still.  *note the broken drop table that has caused the market to be flooded with the goofy yet powerful Greatstaff of Thunder.  In the lower game, a SK can get a 21/24 Shard of Night for about 4k in the bazaar.  What would your warrior, at level 65 give for a 21/24 weapon?<br />
<br />
8. Adding to our DPS woes is LDoN.  DPS is king in LDoN, not survival.  Warriors are liability due to their low damage output.  Hybrids shine in LDoN.  All the things they do better than us matter even more when there is a time limit.  The bosses on the bosskill missions are kinda hard, and keep planting my warrior.  I'd avoid those mission types without a warrior.<br />
<br />
9. Depending on prosthetics (sp?) such as BoC for gaining aggro is lame.  Now we're low DPS *and* undependable.  The knights can do it naked, at will, repeatedly.  My Area Taunt is good once every 15m or so.<br />
<br />
10. Sure, defensive is great, but woe be the warrior who uses a discipline, only to find that there is an add, and he needs his defensive!   For this reason, we effectively have no other disciplines - we're afraid to use them!<br />
<br />
In EQ since PoP, it isn't about living, it's about killing.  That yard trash hitting for 500 in CoD must be nailed down and dispatched ASAP.    This is especially true in LDoN with the timer running. Dead mobs don't hit you back, need to be slowed, or mezzed. <br />

Warriors' tradional advantages have all but disappeared.  Yes, the HP differencial between warriors and Knights has remained constant over the last few years.  But the overall number of HPs for all classes has skyrocketed!  When a strong warrior had 3000 hps and mobs hit for 150, that 2300 knight was fragile.  But now, the same warrior has 8000 Hps, and the knight has 7300.  Now the differencial is not so important.</div></div><hr />

Sorry. What I should have said and meant was have a BoC at best. The new GSoT is a 2H exception to what I've posted, however most Warriors still use 1Hdrs to get their proc rate as high as possible unless of course they have a BoW.<br />

<br />
Tae ew 2hs<br />
<br />
Don't try and compare knights 1hs weapons to ours because they can't dual wield.  it's a moot argument.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ask the monks in your guild what they get hit for on big badass mobs. Or even yard trash.<br />
<br />
Then you'll notice you mitigate a lot more than you think you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">yeah, poor monks.  I feel bad for thier nerf.  altough when I look at what they did do prior to nerf /barf hehe I remember many many monks tanking in CT good enough to where it was moot to use a real tank lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">&quot;I remember many many monks tanking in CT &quot;<br />
<br />
You mean the same CT where taunt was completely broken and wouldn't work?<br />
<br />
In any event, I just used monks as an example because they pull and do get hit often enough to know the difference between bad mitigation and warrior mitigation.<br />
<br />
Ask a ranger or a rogue if you want to.<br />
<br />
Warriors got pretty good mitigation.<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

I think it was like monk heaven then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2 different kinds of monks at the time.<br />
<br />
It was monk heaven for monks who had shaman bots. Which was a large percentage of the monks at the time.<br />
<br />
It wasn't monk heaven for monks who needed groups.<br />
<br />
For them, monk heaven was Velks or Fungus Grove.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />

I was using it as an example of warrior-usable &quot;inverted&quot; weapons is all.</div></div><hr />
