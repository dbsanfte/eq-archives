In retrospect, after the change, I can now see why Onyxia is supposed to be a Tier 2 armor dropping mob versus Tier 1 armor from Molten Core.<br />
<br />
Its with Molten Core components that I've been able to buff my +fire resist up over 300+ and frankly, phase 3 Onyxia is kinda funny for me.  Our main tank doesn't have too much trouble keeping Onyxia in line currently, but the occasional flame breaths to the sides is hilarious when everyone around me gets scorched and I walk away unharmed :D <br />
<br />
Sometimes, berserker rage isn't refreshed fast enough for another fear to happen and running through the lava spouts and resisting all of the damage is a good feeling ;)<br />
<br />
Ya, after the change, she's going to be a bit harder to control for the horde, maybe less so on the Alliance side in Phase 3, but you can mitigate a lot of that incoming damage with tons of fire resist gear.</div></div><hr />
