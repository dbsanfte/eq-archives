http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=892268<br />
<br />
Shadowknight<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=892265<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=892270<br />
<br />
I used only LDON gear, with the exclusion of one Haste item usable by all, a 2 hander from RZtW, PoP jewelry, and bits and pieces.  <br />
<br />
The ONLY items requiring a raid force was the BoW from RZTW, the Dain Ring, and the haste item.<br />
<br />
I did NOT purchase AUG's for the armor as those would differ.<br />
<br />
All three are humans.  All three have ND3, PE,CA3, CS3, PP5, PD3, LR5 and ID5, and Max STA AA's.  ( I know the CA/CS etc stuff doesn't matter but its habit to make everything equal :p)<br />
<br />
They end up with a 633 point HP difference- However the Warrior has a natural 5 STA advantage-  ~35hp.<br />
<br />
Giving them Identical buffs:<br />
<br />
1405 Virtue+ 544 Focus+330 Brells = 7694 for the Pally and SK<br />
and +633 = 8327 for the Warrior.<br />
<br />
The Pally/SK have 92% before STA is maxed.  That probably drops down to 90% once STA is in.  If anyone has the EXACT numbers, we can figure that out.<br />
<br />
If you add in the Aug's you could easily get anohter 500 Hp each.<br />
<br />
So With Gear and Buffs they have 92-93% of our HP.<br />
<br />
Gear only, and they have 89% of our HP<br />
<br />
Without Gear (Ok so I replaced everything with Bronze, or mana only jewelry)  They have 85% of our HP.<br />
<br />
So we give up 4% of our efficiency to Knightimization and 3-4% to buffs.  Just some food for thought.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Heimdall-RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Why?  Does Dex provide HP?  I suppose that where the Knights would add mana/INT/WIS the Warrior would add Dex instead, but really the point of this was to compare HP, not try and get a Maxed stat Magelo for 3 different classes.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The warrior still deals ~20% more damage.<br />
It's less than that, about 5% - 10%, if compairing with Paladins in straight up melee.<br />
SK's are above warriors in DPS if they use their DOTs.<br />
<br />
The warrior still takes ~5% less damage.<br />
Not sure if it's really 5%, it might actually be a lot less in most cases, especially if you have good AC since it was aimed at MAX hits as far as I know.<br />
The judge is still out on this one.<br />
<br />
The warrior still has more hitpoints.<br />
The difference is pretty small though, you gotta agree with that.<br />
Besides, look at how much mana the knights also got - From the same gear no less !<br />
<br />
The warrior still has his discs.<br />
Yes, the biggest difference indeed ... and you have your spells.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If before PoP came out Knights and Warriors were balanced, please explain how we got only a few hps (which Knights got also) and you got 5 levels of spells while we got NOTHING?! It isn't balanced, and stfu about Kunark, we had it harder from EVERY expansion after that, and before Kunark you could solo while we couldn't. I really think stuff *should* be like Kunark was! You get the core classes or everyone is second best. You get utility, we get specialization, and specialization SHOULD balance out not being able to:<br />
<br />
Rez, FD, snare, self haste via cheap spells, Fear Kite, pets, HT, LoH and all the crap you get!<br />
<br />
I think to be really fair (something Knights don't want) we should get Paladin's spells and abilities plus Sk's spells and abilities and make all 3 classes identical, because in relation to casters we all three still blow!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The point of this is what?  Do you really want 500 more HP?  Be my guest because it won't change anything.<br />
<br />
I am so very stumped why some of you are so HP fixated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Because in the end, it all comes down to either pure mitigation or pure HP, Aeka. They've given every class the same boost in pure mitigation that we get with AA's, and they've given every class a similar boost in gear HP that we get. The difference between a Warrior and every other class in both mitigation and HP (prior to the mitigation boost that just went live) is the smallest it's ever been.<br />
<br />
 Some folks would like to see that balance restored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Rez, FD, snare, self haste via cheap spells, Fear Kite, pets, HT, LoH and all the crap you get! <br />
<br />
For fucks sake knights dont get eachothers spells....<br />
<br />
GOD DAMN PURE MELEE ARE SO POWERFUL THEY get FD SoS Sneak TONS of Disciplines escape instill doubt  backstabbing flurry Mitigation bonus, evasion bonus, ac bonus... its a super class i tell you<br />
<br />
you know why the extra HP on a warrior is important, and its not &quot;just&quot; 500 hp, because 500 HP makes you get to the &quot;plateau&quot; where you can tank a mob much easier a lot quicker then any other class....<br />
<br />
Differnce between a 9000 and 9500 tank on Xegony is pretty signicent....<br />
<br />
Tallon Zek in time? what is the plateau where people say he becomes easy to tank? 11500 or 11000?<br />
<br />
seriously warriors got a lot this recent patch, are getting more... does anyone even remember why the probelms between knights and warriors happened? because knights have almost all issues addressed, better spells, better dps better tanking, content better for them....<br />
<br />
the same god damn thing wil happen again if every single concern or issue is &quot;fixxed..&quot; No i'm not gunna go around yelling omg its kunark agian cause its not, however whenever their been a problem in game, so many facets try to fix it, that it get sover fixxed, and just needs to be fixxed a year later...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
anyways i bet the fix warriors pretty damn well with next patch, then give em more bonus's in xpack like opposite of what they did in pops to monks<br />
<br />
Monk change anyone? lets change content to make it so monks cant tank as well ok that will work... lets nerf monks so they cant tank content as well ok that works... oh shit did both of them thats too much =(((((((( thats baddd<br />
<br />
in addition one reason i doubt you'll ever see an flag HP increase to warriors is because too much balance and content is based on it (ie &quot;plateaus&quot; warriors are already the most HP tank in game, but not the best aggro/tanks in game, bringing their aggro up wasnt something that drastically affected game/content (not class, it did effect class balanace) because it was not superior to anything else......<br />
<br />
<br />
is it balance you want or just want to have a better class?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Barraind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Because in the end, it all comes down to either pure mitigation or pure HP, Aeka. They've given every class the same boost in pure mitigation that we get with AA's, and they've given every class a similar boost in gear HP that we get.<br />
<br />
You do realize you have: <br />
<br />
better (parsable) innate mitigation (better + same % aa boost equals &quot;more better&quot; (better than better) not &quot;the same&quot;)<br />
<br />
better (parsable) innate avoidance (better + same % aa boost equals &quot;more better (better than better)&quot; not &quot;the same&quot;) <br />
<br />
A (parsable) less streaky DI scaling, compared to other classes, in this example knights who spike at (the most noticeable spike) 20 di, meaning that even before mitigation changes, a warrior would take less damage per actual hits (smooth % curve as opposed to large knight spikes at 15 and 20di), in addition to getting hit some % less<br />
<br />
better (numerically speaking) innate, geared and buffed hp<br />
<br />
You can take any % figures of identical gear and throw them around to prove any point you want, but one thing you have to include is the likelyhood of characters being equipped the same, even looking at only buyable armor (excluding ornate and hot/kael mq's as those arent &quot;identical&quot;, the likelyhood of finding a warrior and a knight equipped identically is slim to none.<br />
<br />
In Hemidal's Example for example, the knights would simply not use that gear with what they would have availible at that level (worse ac/hp earring, worse ac/hp helm, worse hp/ac boots, worse hp/ac range depending on price, ect).  Equal isnt always.  This example proves it. <br />
<br />
and to open up another can of worms, should a knight equipped at levels above and beyond an equivalent warrior have less hp/ac/survivability/ect  (i dont have the links at my fingertips, but compare an elemental paladin to a pre elem (mostly ornate, hot quest bracer andor ear andor cloak, bloodmetal ears, dain ring, ect) warrior, the warrior will generally have more hp/ac still), same with time paladin and largely elem warrior, ect)<br />

<br />
Sorry,  but I have to call &quot;prove it!&quot; on the 5-10% in straight melee thinggy (and no,  I don't mean you with your GSoT vs a knight with Ssra/Tier3 weaponry and some vengence gear).  <br />
<br />
I just don't see that being true except at a few places in the game where there's a significant weapon itemisation disparity (e.g. goldenrod's damn good for Ssra basement) or without a big difference in +atk gear, buffs etc...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">And I wanted to FD during the big train that ran me down in Kael, and rez myself (LoH or FD would have allowed me to skip death/exp loss) when I died costing me 1100 pp and some experience in the last 3 weeks. Get this, KNIGHTS HAVE OTHER FUCKING ABILITIES AND THEY WILL NOT TANK EQUAL TO A WARRIOR BECAUSE THERE IS A COST INVOLVED FOR THOSE ABILITIES! Got it now? <br />
If you argue that Knights need to tank equal to warriors, then give me tools EQUAL to LoH or FD plus a spell book, thats what you jackasses don't want: fair and equal: or are to stupid to know how useful Knight abilities are (give them to me and I will show you how to exploit the hell out of them). <br />
500hps does not in any way, shape, or form equal Knight abilities and spell book when it constitutes 3.5% of the total hps involved (after self buffs thrown).<br />
BTW, prove Paladins do 85% of our damage yourself, I then will prove how Paladin OUTDAMAGE warriors when fighting undead, when they have Slay Undead, yet another ability(it was supposed to be nerfed but they threw a fit)........anyone arguing SKs do less DPS than a Warrior means you are to STUPID to be bothered with.<br />

<br />
BTW, I have said this before, call in an outside team of devs to look at balance, I GUARANTEE they will find FOR Warriors and AGAINST Knights. My friend REFUSES to play any game where classes are BLATANTLY favored to solo over others. He play tests games for other companies. BTW&lt; no response about Knights (esp SK) being able to solo and Warrior not without silly outlays of plat for equipment, I am waiting.....I demand they fix that also if they even think about giving Knights any more hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Warriors were a more powerful class overall before these melee changes than either knight and now we got some big boosts.<br />
<br />
&quot;give me tools EQUAL to LoH or FD plus a spell book&quot;<br />
<br />
How about Evasive?  I'd say Evasive &gt; LoH.  Also, Evasive &gt; FD now that Pacify/Lull is so overpowered.  As for the rest of the spellbook, there's our higher damage output, other discs, /shield, higher mitigation, hps, etc.<br />
<br />
I think your basic problem is that you're looking for what class can grind easy, boring xp without ever dying; rather than what class can have the most fun adventuring and defeating powerful foes.  One is work and one is fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Those magelos are pretty meaningless, I have gear unavailable to 90%+ of the player base, and that gear is not available to me. AVERAGE Warrior, vs AVERAGE Paladin vs AVERAGE SK is what we need. Then agro lock is a HUGE issue, because none of the three can do any real damage with their bazaar bought weapons/haste and Casters are leaned on HARD to deal damage.<br />
Knights don't like to discuss that or lie about how meaningless it is. What it has basically come down to is a group of liars (ie some Knights) attempting to make truth out of a twisted set of numbers favoring themselves. Agro is ALL that matters in a exp group setting, because melee DPS is virtually meaningless (and we can prove SK does more DPS at that), Casters MUST be able deal the damage. The Devs are such a group of idiots they didn't even realize how much agro stuns and snares (darkness) give. So again, an outside COMPETANT group of Devs should look at this issue, Knights will LOSE! I guarantee it!<br />
<br />
Balance: Agro lock<br />
              Soloing ability <br />
              Hit Points<br />
              Mitigation<br />

              AA's<br />
              Group desirability<br />
<br />
To me Qest, the ability Knights have shown to be able to solo before the patch PROVES without a shadow of any doupt they were more powerful! LoH and spell book is less?! Nope, I want to trade for my stuff I got in the patch for that book and LoH, WOOT gimme it! Another pro-knight proposterus statement issued from Qest, ie Iloveknightsandwantallgroups while Warriorgetsnogroup.<br />
BTW Qest, your staff is for sale in Tunare bazaar...1,000,000pp right now, seriously! Thats how much it is obvious to everyone (but the select group of liars) that agro lock is #1 consideration. Qest 90%+ of the players in EQ NEVER raid, got that, NEVER, and I have ZERO interest in Raiding like I used to, so yes, I want easy death free exp like 90%+ of the EQ population. You are unable to see that because you raid, we majority do NOT. EQ MUST serve the MAJORITY or it will die.</div></div><hr />

(endurance is being added, we won't even mention KEI and FT, plus the fact a 100hp/100mana item is better on a Knight than Warrior who gets no benefit from the 100mana)<br />

(you should play another game, your knowledge of EQ is sadly lacking, we have done WORK leveling our chars, you start a new char)<br />
<br />
Just give it up, you seem to have not played EQ at all with these proposterous statements. BTW, I two box a Shaman, I know how much aggro slow is. I have also played a druid, try snaring AFTER assist is called on a raid and sitting to med, if it was a Warrior who called assist, you WILL be summoned!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Partha, you can be blissfully ignorant if you want but more HP won't make Warriors any more attractive unless you want to have medorce Warriors sporting 10K HP and the high end doing 18K.<br />
<br />
And in the end it won't make you any more attractive than an 8K HP Ranger.  More HP won't be able to cover up the fact that Rangers (or Monks or Beastlords or whatever) can do way more than Warriors.<br />
<br />
The more I think about the situation, the better I think BB's suggestions on changing Warrior, Paladin, and SK mitigation to mean something real makes sense.  Tanking shouldn't have been just about HP.  If you want to cling to that system then don't worry about how well Knights tank but how well Monk, Ranger and Beastlord do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Heimdall-RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You think Evasive is better than LoH?<br />
<br />
You think 500 hit points against mobs that routinely hit for more than 800 is even worth mentioning?<br />
<br />
Other Discs... Hmm does Mightystrike = Slay Undead?  Yeah, yeah Slay Undead is an AA not a disc.<br />
<br />
I've never had a 3K Crippling Blow with Mightstrike but I've seen more than enough 3K crits with Slay Undead.<br />
<br />
Oooooh /Shield.  Yeah, we can use that on the Paladin/SK with the agro lock.<br />
<br />
Ya know, you poked fun at the Magelo's but the point was to put them in exactly duplicative gear.  Not to put them in the BEST gear.  Like I said, I wanted to go with stuff that was almost solely grind group stuff... 3 raid drops, for haste, EB, and the instaclicky.<br />
<br />
We're not entirely focused on HP.  We're focused on the Warrior's &quot;in&quot; for groups... what makes groups want warriors.  That has always been our CH efficiency.  500 Pure hp, and 500hp worth of added mitigation doesn't feed the bulldog facing mobs that can hit for 990.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">After 7500 HP there is no more CH efficiency.  Again I have to ask what is the difference between a 8K HP Ranger and any level Warrior in an exp group?  Once slowed, you are better of with the Ranger.  With the weapon's I've seen Rangers get they do more damage anyway.<br />
<br />
If you think 1K HP more is going to make groups love Warriors you are going to be sorely mistaken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Heimdall-RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">And they can't give us 1K more HP for spells, and more mitigation for CH efficiency?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The problem isn't the HP gap, it's the mitigation gap.  I'm hoping mobs in the next expansion hit 2-3x as hard as in PoP and that only warriors, paladins, and SKs get any sort of mitigation increase whatsoever.  People used to laugh at the idea of a ranger tanking for an xp group.  That's the way it should be.  They're DPS, not tanks.  SoE has already shown that they are incapable of balancing HPs properly.  They should balance us instead with mitigation.  The innate 5% DI mod was a good first step.  IMO they need to add tank only AAs that increase that advantage.  And yes I do think Paladins and SKs should get it too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Heimdall-RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Rangers get Taunt don't they?  They're a tank.  A light tank that would only be used in a pinch to be sure, but they ARE a tank.  Monks are DPS. Rogues are DPS.  Neither of those classed get a taunt button.<br />
<br />
Further, I think the pure casters, and priests are already too far behind us in HP and mitigation.  The mobs and Buffs have scaled up too fast for the innate class abilities and growth to keep up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Yes, once slowed the entire thing is trivial and we are back before Kunark, get a Ranger to tank! I play a Shaman like I said, this is a comment made to me by a Paladin &quot;are you even being hit?&quot;. The mobs swing so slow, the only important thing is sticking one spell on the mob and then nuking like mad till its dead. <br />
The next expansion needs to add unslowable mobs, lets see a Beastlord or Ranger tank then! Add better mitigation for all the Tank Plate classes, and for god sake give monks back their old avoidance. But the Devs aren't smart enough to do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Heimdall-RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">No, but more slow mitigation would be OK with me.  I prefer that to outright immunity.  The downside to that is that more than ever agro lock becomes important further devaluing the warrior.<br />
<br />
What did they do to monk avoidance?  I was under the impression they only tinkered with monk mitigation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Rangers don't need Taunt any more than Paladins or SKs needed Taunt to do their jobs.  I won't even touch upon Beastlords.<br />
<br />
Warriors are &quot;devaluated&quot; because mitigation is for crap.  There is little savings putting any tank up against a monster.  For too many monsters, you can avoid melee all together.  And for the rest (like a lot of LDoN) the melee damage isn't that harsh allowing less than heavy armor to engage it.<br />
<br />
So go ahead on your quest for more HP.  Its ultimately hollow quest due to not only itemization but because of the way healing works.  I'll champion mitigation changes instead which is a far more perminate fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Heimdall-RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I agree.  As a warrior I want 15% Mitigation, not 4%.  4% is the margin for error in political polls.  4% can be wiped out by the RNG.  I want a HP gap larger than what a mob can hit for in one swing, and I want Mitigation that's larger than the margin of error allowed for by most statistical analysis.</div></div><hr />

If you cant see what the issue is in you getting a 425% innate mitigation boost and a 40 - 120%% naked hp boost... are you playing the same game most people are?<br />
<br />
Ya know, you poked fun at the Magelo's but the point was to put them in exactly duplicative gear. Not to put them in the BEST gear. Like I said, I wanted to go with stuff that was almost solely grind group stuff... 3 raid drops, for haste, EB, and the instaclicky.<br />

We're not entirely focused on HP. We're focused on the Warrior's &quot;in&quot; for groups... what makes groups want warriors.<br />
<br />
How will showing 3 different classes, with magelo's they wouldnt realistically ever use, show that?<br />

Find a paladin, ask what similar level gear they would use. Find a sk, ask what similar level gear they would use. Repeat with warrior, compare those magelos. Thats close to the actual, not the hypothetical that will never happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Sorguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">What needs to be done by SoE to allow for class balance is to find a way to let warriors have superior aggro hold to paladins and SK's, while Paladins and SK's remain a viable option for other reasons - [UTILITY DAMN YOU].<br />
<br />
<br />
This is hard for SoE I'm sure, but I'm hoping they'll have it figgured out by GoD.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
My personal opinion?<br />
<br />
Unlink all disc drop resue timer on incite to 15 seconds, drop it's endurance cost by 2/3rds, and you're even on the warrior front for aggro control.<br />
<br />
Additionally you could remove chance for taunt to fail, same difference to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
To balance Pal/SK, they need to create further knight only specilization for those classes, and I don't mean situational type stuff.<br />
<br />
I mean giving paladins and SK's whole new set's of abilities not even thought of yet.<br />
<br />
They could be REALLY nice, but if they were REALLY nice, I'd expect either a small nerf or a slight improvement to warriors.<br />
<br />
Not give warriors all that crap give pallies and SK's something then give something more, but if they give paladins and SK's AMAZING abilities, warriors should get at least one of thier own, whether or not it's situational.<br />
<br />
If they do it right, the &quot;opening&quot; (dear lord, I hope it's not an &quot;opening&quot; system, because more RNG blows) System could do this in and of itself.<br />
<br />
What I'm honestly hoping for is for VI to just up and give melee the spells they need to balance, not the spells they need to balance on an RNG.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, the problem with EQ being balanced for melee is melee is too simplistic, if they gave us the opening system as a spell book, it would solve many problems.</div></div><hr />

Who cares if Warriors can get 20K HP when a Ranger or a Monk can get 8K and tank exp content?  Tanking does offer any more security than other tatics (say good old kiting).  Tanking barely is worth the mana consumed to sustain.  For sure, tanking doesn't kill the monster any faster.  You want to know why Warriors are having a hard time justifying their value in exp groups it is because tanking as a tactic is about dead.<br />
<br />
Simply put: no more HP will &quot;fix&quot; anything about Warriors.  Not 1 HP not 100 HP not 1K HP.  In fact no more HP will &quot;fix&quot; Paladins for that matter either.  If you continue to obscess over HP you fail to see what is the real problem in the game.  Ironically enough, your fix will continue to make the problem worse.</div></div><hr />

Do you suppose your 8K ranger is moderately or well equipped?<br />
<br />
Adding another 500-750 hp to warriors across the board won't do much for the 9K warrior, you're right.  Adding 500-750 to the average or even slightly below average 5.5K warrior will.  It takes a lot to get an 8K ranger.  It takes less, but still takes some doing to get an 8K Plate tank.  Scaling the Innate HP gap to 1K makes it easier for the lower middle geared warrior to reach 8-8.5K.  An 8K ranger isn't premium CH efficiency by the way.  At least I wouldn't want to risk the purple club that often for 7500 CH's.<br />
<br />
Simply put: an Increased HP gap will help lower to middle geared warriors reach the CH breaking point easier.   <br />
<br />
Simply put: 4% mitigation is too small, and can be wiped out by the notoriously bad Random Number Generator.  The innate mitigation bonus should be real, and unambiguous.  Closer to 10-15%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You currently have a (depending on who you listen to) 2.5 - 5% advantage in innate mitigation. Raising that to 15% is a... 300% - 600% boost (a 15% boost would give you 2.875 - 5.75% innate advantage).<br />
<br />
you said - &quot;I want a HP gap larger than what a mob can hit for in one swing&quot;<br />
<br />
that is anywhere from three HUNDRED to three THOUSAND hp. You would have to give that to naked stats of course (assuming 2700 with max aa's, and this is probably a low). Giving you anywhere from an additional 11% - 200% bonus (though for the sake of sanity, I assume its nowhere near the 3k mark.<br />

No, &quot;different&quot;, does not mean worse (or better), and in the case of equivalent gear, would make the actual visible hp/ac numbers worse. <br />

I do? Wow, I never knew that before, thanks for taking what other people have said and inserting it into my mouth.  One could certainly make the &quot;fortitude/defensive/evasive &gt; loh in some circumstances&quot; argument, but I havent yet.<br />
<br />
Do you suppose your 8K ranger is moderately or well equipped<br />
<br />
An 8k ranger is decently equipped. Far, far better equipped than a 4-6k warrior, far better than an 8k warrior as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
It takes a lot to get an 8K ranger. It takes less, but still takes some doing to get an 8K Plate tank. Scaling the Innate HP gap to 1K makes it easier for the lower middle geared warrior to reach 8-8.5K.<br />
<br />
It takes a lot of work to get to 8k as a ranger. It takes less work to get to 8k as a knight. It takes less work than that to get to 8k as a warrior.  How does adding 500-750 hp to a warrior change whats wrong? It doesnt? oh.  It would help once again reduce mob and spell balance? oh.  It would accomplish exactly nothing positive? oh.<br />

Simply put: an Increased HP gap will help lower to middle geared warriors reach the CH breaking point easier. <br />
<br />
Simply put: 4% mitigation is too small, and can be wiped out by the notoriously bad Random Number Generator. The innate mitigation bonus should be real, and unambiguous. Closer to 10-15%.<br />
<br />
What would either of these accomplish apart from having to redesign content at EVERY LEVEL?  You realize the mitigation change has already impacted several highest end fights, right? As &quot;insignificant&quot; as 3-5% is, its already causing headaches?<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me assure you of one thing, the situation has LOTS of 4k-5.5k hps Warriors pissed off to the point they won't start a new char, THEY WILL QUIT IN MASS HORDES AND PLAY WORLD OF WARCRAFT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />

So you would rather make it mass hordes of still ineffective 5-6k warriors and numbers of other classes who think its idiotic and still would serve no purpose?<br />
<br />
You think theres just possibly a reason the devs dont do the very first thing they get the idea for? That maybe they actually think about game balance sometimes? That they realize how idiotic adding a mitigation bonus over 300% of what they already added is, and how it could seriously screw up many fights? <br />

My bad, you're right, I did mistake that for your opinion.<br />
<br />
However:  I've already pointed out how little effect the 4% mitigation does on the AVERAGE grind mob for a 65 warrior.  Its an entirely miniscule ammount.  Triple it, and we're talking about a definitive efficiency edge.<br />
<br />
Everyone else here has agreed time and time again, more HP in the high end game is meaningless, however for the middle geared or even slightly undergeared warrior it would make a huge difference.  It should be more than marginally but less than significantly easier for a warrior to reach 8-9K than a knight- and they easier than a ranger.<br />
<br />
a 10K warrior with Time weapons isn't going to care one way or the other about another 500-750 hp.  A 4.5-5.5K warrior using Anger Aug's cause they don't have an EB weapon will greatly appreciate it, because for them it DOES make a difference.<br />
<br />
4% Mitigation is already unbalancing current encoutners?  Which ones?  What's the DB and DI involved?  I'll play.  Lets crunch the numbers.  What are they?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">You're missing the point Heimdall.  If rangers and beastlords can currently tank xp group mobs all the way up to PoE, PoFire, and LDON Hard adventures (and they can) then adding more hps to warriors won't make us more desired as tanks because they can still be tanked by non warriors who offer more to the group than tanking.<br />
<br />
If I wasn't a warrior and was making a group why would I take a warrior or even a paladin as a tank when a beastlord or ranger could do it and increase our kill rate in the process?  Both warrior and knight tanking is overkill for almost all XP groups.<br />
<br />
For that to not be the case they'd need to either significantly nerf the mitigation and/or avoidance of all non tank classes or increase the damage output of mobs significantly and slightly boost warrior and knight mitigation/avoidance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Crashbomba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">using eq rankings listings. the middle of the pack warrior has 6253 hp.<br />
paladin 5136hp. shadowknight 5075.<br />
<br />
granted there are alot of magelos not posted or are fake. so from this the middle of the pack warrior had 1k hp advantage over the average paladin/sk.  biggest difference between paladin/sk vs the warrior is solo ablility and snap aggro.  basically we are where we need to be at for hp.<br />
<br />
the new abilities have given us a bigger edge on aggro control and better use of the disciplines that we have to give us the advantage.  the classes arent broken as badly as people want us to believe. its the end game thats broken and has been broken for the longest time. <br />
<br />
with levels getting up to 65 and supposedly 70 in the next expansion it will most likely get worse.  LDoN was a step in the right direction with the ability for the average non uber guilded classes to get the equipment to make the game more fun.<br />
<br />
get over the classes are broken thing cause they really arent. the sk/paly may have an easier time tanking in exp groups due to the better control of aggro but a warrior is more fun.  ive played 4 warriors during my EQ career. ive played every class other then a bard to 50 or higher at one time or another. in end only my warrior has given me more long term satisfaction. thats why i keep playing him and will continue doing so.</div></div><hr />

As far as saying that this warrior is in the &quot;top 10&quot; guilds on your server, as far as a reader would think (noticed no one replies to you:rolleyes: ), he could be in a ToV raiding guild.  Surely if hes in elementals he would be WAYYYY over 6100hp unbuffed.  I wouldnt doubt it if ornate would get warriors over 6k assuming hp aa's are completed /duck.  <br />
<br />
As far as your comments go on paladin dps :D , the difference between us and the next class ahead of us (warriors) as far as dps goes is huge, ie ~20% from a warriors... that is a fact, parses are on boards here somewhere if that is hard for you to believe :D.  You mentioned undead, in case you werent aware, 2% of our hits are slays, that is a fact.  Remember most paladins are on 2 handers with huge delays compared to warrior 1handers.  Remember that slays can also happen when a mob is 1% health, ie thats not dps (what nukers nuke mobs when they 1% health already?), when compared to it slaying and the mob still stands after it.  I have parsed lots of raid mobs, I have yet to see a warrior that DIDNT outdamage paladins, undead mobs are a different story... I'll let you take a guess on how many raid mobs are undead.  Also, while we get a 25% haste buff that requires 300mana to cast, you can right click your ornate gauntlets to get 30%, amongst your other clickies.<br />
<br />
As far as buffs go, melee never had to buy spells, ie I spent over 250k on all spells, EASILY over 350k if Rhag1 didnt drop RGC for me (if it was even on sale).  And virtue is just about anywhere for anyone for 12pp.  By the way, none of us actually use heroic bond/marzin/BoW in xp groups or raids =).<br />

Id like to see a 56 paladins 300hp Greater Heals outheal a level 39 clerics Complete Heal, and 44-45 they get celestial healing, which overwrites PoP level paladins heal over time.  Id like to see a 56 Paladin out tank a warrior on AoW or even the statues.  I assure you no 56 paladin earned enough pp at his level to nearly afford a Blade of Carnage (300kpp minimum on CT), dont tell me we solo that well cuz we dont, specially not pre 59.  Compare your twink pal to a twink war.  FT isnt a high priority for paladins as your twinkpal has, look at magelo profiles, hardly any paladin ever passes FT4, not like we in a chain heal program.</div></div><hr />

So since you are not getting it Knights let me spell it out.<br />
1. Far more people play EQ in exp groups than raiding guilds.<br />
2. Many more two box a tank type plus cleric/shaman/druid than are in raiding guilds. <br />
3. I could give two shits if you don't use your Knight abilities in a raiding guild. You constitute less than 1% of the EQ population and should be IGNORED by Sony if they know whats good for business.<br />
4. Paladins can pacify, SKs can FD to split spawns, Warriors get to tank the whole group. This matter to 99% of us, I still could care less about the raider 1% in this game.<br />
5. When a Druid or Shaman is healing because Clerics are the most friggin boring class to play (90% of the time for us 99%, who cares about the 1% raider types) Paladin buffs DO matter! Esp rez and hp buffs, because of the lack of the most boring class (cleric) to play being around.<br />
6. Stop mentioning your boring ass raider mentality, of we have 36 people to cover every buff, I and 99% of the player base could care less, big whoopee dee doo, it does NOTHING for the actual situation 99% of play in.<br />
7. Soloing DOES matter to the 99%, again Sony ignore the 1% or suffer a mass bail out when WoW comes out.<br />

HP is a red herring.  Every class needs the HP found on elemental gear to survive POP style events.  I will not deny Enchanters high HP items because they frankly need it to weather the unavoidable damage being thrown around.  If resists were geared correctly *maybe* they don't need the HP but as long as many effects have -300 resist adjust forget it.  We all need HP to widthstand magic damage.<br />

 Actually, the best games of history allow for all players to achieve the end of the game. 99% of the player base certianly CAN go to PoTime if they so chose and were able to allot the time to do so.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">But the game becomes more trival as everyone gets aggro lock, and better mitigation. <br />
The infighting between warriors and pal's / sk's make develpers either F the game up more, By nerfing or giving lock's.<br />
<br />
The agro lock that Paladins have and SKs, is NOT meant to be there! So getting rid of it is NOT a nerf, it is a correction to an agro bug. I always was in favor of a big phat nerfing of agro lock, and instead giving mitagation to Plate Tanks, and nerfing to hell the caster mitigation. I don't like the game being as easy as it is, but already a bunch of morons have made 65th level, so its to late.<br />
The tendency have been to &quot;dumb&quot; down the game, so giving Warriors agro lock too hurts the game how? You are just another full of shit Knight passing off BS as fact.</div></div><hr />

Wars &amp; Pal &amp; Sk should have the SAME MITIGATION TABLES<br />
Wars &amp; Pal &amp; Sk should have the SAME HP TABLES<br />
<br />
Good, now since we are all 3 alike you have to balance.<br />
Give out an edge to the warrior to compensate the lack of spells.<br />
You cant touch defensive skills cause it will be a mess.<br />
<br />
Thus to balance its either HP or Mitigation.<br />
Choose ONE and stick with it.<br />
<br />
You cant balance using HP / Innate Mitigation / Defensive Skills.<br />
Thats 3 Fucking variables its impossible to balance.<br />
<br />
At least they got it right closing the defensive skill gap.<br />
We are down to 2 variables, that is still too much.<br />
<br />
Now we have a X% hp bonus (thats owned by AoC)<br />
Now we have a Y% mitigation bonus (partial mitigation actually)<br />
<br />
Thats nice, can anyone tell me exactly how much better i tank<br />
than a pal/sk without running impossible parses ?<br />
<br />
I want 10% more HP or 10% less damage taken per hit. (fictive numbers)<br />
<br />
5% innate shielding, plus some funky HP bonus doesnt suit me.<br />

you make me laugh.  A 300hp buff &quot;owns&quot; and closes the gap between war/pal hps lol, try  another  several hundred.<br />
Read up above... that is not a 300hp difference<br />
using eq rankings listings. the middle of the pack warrior has 6253 hp.<br />
paladin 5136hp. shadowknight 5075.<br />
<br />
look at any war/pal in game who have similar play times, same tiers, rest is self explanatory.  And again, the only way a paladin can touch warrior hp's, is if he really sucks<br />
<br />
oh, and dont forget how much dps paladins do too, specially against them undead mobs and other bs, as well as having more innate attack, higher weapon skills, and how you can now keep agro off me after casting 2 stuns on a mob incoming, and how you can now &quot;heal&quot; yourself, etc.  <br />
<br />
We all know there is a problem with itemization, and how ya'll need more AC/hps, but some of ya'll just make TSW, TheSteelWhiners for crying out loud.  Just like in the old days those some of you always gotta be the best of everything, king of ac, hps, and now agro... sorry bro, no, casters own agro, at their will... and now with all your doodads via discs, its not guaranteed, it has gotten AT LEAST a little better for you recently, and im happy for ya'll :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">The game got more trival because of Caster power multiplicatively getting stronger every expandsion.  Holding agro doesn't kill the monster.  Its the fact that Casters are stronger than ever offensively and defensively.<br />
<br />
Forget agro control.  The one thing that ruined the game for the likes of you was KEI (and to some sense Quint).  Everything afterwards is just a side effect of having almost infinite mana reserves (especially on TWO classes that do massive debufs anyway).  If you want to pin all of the woes of EQ on something go bug Enchanters and Shamans.<br />
<br />
But you've heard this from me before.  Nerf down Paladins and SKs will not make Warriors more wanted.  Casters are willing to work with whatever because they are that strong.  Stacking on even more a few hundred more HP does not impress any of them.</div></div><hr />

They never have named the Dev who played warrior, he is the one that should have been taken out and shot at the start of EQ (and Necromancer Dev awarded)! Warriors were total ass at the beginning of EQ. Then by Kunark they actually had it right (screw what knights says about Kunark). Then the Devs got clueless again and fux0red everything up after that. if you put items out there with same AC, same hps, PLUS mana ion them, knights get more out of the item. THATS A DUH, NO SHEET THING THAT A CLUELESS MORON COULD FIGURE OUT! So the devs must be a group of clueless morons for sure, they are programmers, NOT game developers, there is a BIG difference. I have said this before I will say it again, an OUTSIDE COMPETANT GROUP OF GAME DEVS NEED TO LOOK AT THIS GAME! <br />
1. Bet you they WOULD take into account soloing vs grouping as fully equal concepts, other games do. In fact a class that can't solo (warrior/rogue) are considered BROKEN.<br />
2. They would get you can't have 70AC 100hps 100mana SK/Paladin/Warrior on an item and call it balanced!<br />
3. You can't give new spells to two classes from 61-65 and another class NOTHING.<br />
4. Charm and Slow were two of the most retarded ideas ever in history of gaming! Those two abilitie/spells cause more problems in this game.<br />
5. You are right, none of the devs play EQ, so they have no idea what the hell they are doing!<br />
6. Paladins bitch about the DPS difference between them and Warriors, well, giving SKs more DoTs (plus better pet) sure did fux0r the balance at levels 61-65 (plus items with same stats plus mana, FT items, and KEI). So OBVIOUSLY (to even the most clueless) SK DPS is now to high compared to Warriors (and Paladins/Rangfers/Monks/Rogues) so that need to be rebalanced too.<br />
7. I really don't think the Devs can be that dumb, I think they are just programmers, writing script, so I will no longer refer to them as Devs but &quot;Programmers&quot;. Furor has been bitching about EQ being in &quot;beta&quot; for so long, he is RIGHT, because the &quot;Programmers&quot; are to lazy to use checks and balances on things added to the game.<br />
8. BTW, the lazy ass &quot;Programmers&quot; can fix it so PvP is balanced too. It is in the Game, fix it or eliminate it. It matters a Knight can kick a Warrior's ass in PvP too, so fix that while you are at it.</div></div><hr />

PvP has been a joke for years and years now. A not stupid bard will never lose to anyone, its all about gear after a certain point, casters get amazingly gimped after certain levels of equip are reached, and in more than 1 on 1, any healer of any kind means you are never going to die.<br />
<br />
<br />
Charm and Slow were two of the most retarded ideas ever in history of gaming! Those two abilitie/spells cause more problems in this game<br />
<br />
Take out slow and try to balance every single encounter in the game. Its impossible.  You would have a good number of underpowered mobs (take just boss fights and make every mob designed for some level of slow mitigation naturally that speed) especially in experience groups.  You would also be able to get rid of the shaman class for the most part.  Charm isnt a bad idea, it only has an issue in a few lower end pop zones.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can't give new spells to two classes from 61-65 and another class NOTHING.<br />
<br />
Levels are not nothing in themselves... you have better survivability at 65 over 60 without any extra aa's, skill boosts, ect. That should say something in itself about levels.  Notice, the casters generally see less to nothing of a bump in those regards.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 They would get you can't have 70AC 100hps 100mana SK/Paladin/Warrior on an item and call it balanced!<br />
<br />
With a limited number of drop slots you can. Theres a reason mobs outside of ~7 zones do not drop molds/patterns/quest drop pieces.  If you were to take time, for instance, and itemize every mob with different drops for every single class, based only on the loot they currently drop, you would have 41 - 116 unique drops per mob. With mobs dropping 3-4 (and quarms 4th is only a bp chance) you would likely be more pissed about itemization.<br />
<br />
And &quot;a_range_thingy_template_from_quarm_01&quot; to give to some random quest turnn guy deep in the poi factory or near KoS in saryrns tower doesnt sound like fun, to anyone.  That also leads to the issue of balancing every drop per class, which is enough of a headache in there as it is, as even members of each class cant tell you the best way to itemize them, and its impossible to add too much for some classes, or take away too much for others, ect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bet you they WOULD take into account soloing vs grouping as fully equal concepts, other games do. In fact a class that can't solo (warrior/rogue) are considered BROKEN<br />
<br />
The game has moved away from soloing exp, with ldon being forced group and PoP/GoD being much better to people who group, solo is being forgotten about by a good number of people.  The trick is, they cant fix soloing.  They cannot make classes who cant solo now able to (how would they even accomplish that), and by nerfing and current classes ability to solo, it would be through some game mechanic that likely would have a much broader range of impact.<br />

<br />
From parses on this board, Warriors are doing more base dps compared to knights, with the same weapon, and outclass them when using better (dbow/eoe vs gboc). Sk's can out dps warriors, on a somewhat inconsistent basis, for the most part, they arent.  Neither are rangers, in actual situations, in best circumstance parses (read: not actual), they jump around a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Heimdall-RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">So looking at: <br />

<br />
And <br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23157<br />
<br />
You honestly think the people who make this game play this game?  Lets make an item with a recomended level of 63.  Now lets put a focus effect on it only good for spells up to level 60.  We can make the game lore something like &quot;Ha-ha jokes on you, even as you buy this for your twink, know you'll just have to upgrade it before you even get full use out of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
How about the 100hp shield with 50 mana, and a Focus effect that allows the paladins and SK's to get MORE spell and Bash hate?  It was bad enough when I only remembered it as being warrior only and no drop, but now its also open to SK/PAL and plays right into their strengths.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">I can think of two examples at least where that Focus is good:<br />
<br />
 1) Mages wanting Earth Pets who don't have the 65 one.<br />
<br />
 2) Necros who don't have the 61 pet who aren't yet 63.<br />
<br />
 Is it good for all classes at all times? No.<br />
<br />
 Does it have situational uses for some classes? Yes.<br />
<br />
 And the same goes with the dumb ass shield too. And every piece of gear that drops in EQ. The dropoff in stats from the recommended level to level 60 is insignificant, and offers something fairly nice for those that can use it in the way of Focus Effects. Not to mention you can (OMG) swap it in and out as you need to cast stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Heimdall-RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Necros who don't have their level 61 pet...  The 100 pp Ethereal parchment turn in pet?<br />
<br />
Those 60+ mages who don't use reagents for pets anymore?<br />
Or the mages who can summon a Free Conservation item?<br />
<br />
What exactly is the situational use warriors would have for that shield.  Change it in and out for Incite?  Maybe, if it affected Incite, everyone else I've heard from says it doesn't.<br />
<br />
I also have to ask... do you REALLY think gear you have to wear to SET UP your play session is good itemization?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Enchanters soloing areas meant for groups is just fine by you, but not to me and the others who was FORCED to group (without enchanters because they are hogging spawns meant for groups) due to a BROKEN set of spells given STUPIDLY to them by &quot;Programmers&quot; who don't play or understand their own game.<br />

<br />
Its fine with you because you are pro-Knight and anti-Warrior. A Knight should be less than 80% tank and 15% Caster (because casters are more powerful) to maintain any balance at all. Itemization is causing problems in the balance, FROM MY WARRIOR VIEW POINT.<br />

<br />
Well I for one started this game in 1999, I DEMAND THE BEST GROUPABILITY OF ALL TANK CLASSES! I am the one who spent two hours yelling ooc for groups (with a zillion other FORCED group classes) while my friend's SK soloed specs and kept all the loot for himself. Or a group of 3 Paladin's and 3 SK's roved LGuk, while I was FORCED to find a Cleric (who are hardly played because most find them boring to play, due to &quot;Programmers&quot; pathetic design at the start of EQ). So they fixed some stuff? How about a NEW person to EQ now, think they will find a group? Think they will have the equipment to play a soloing Warrior (hahah, yea right). I would love to sentance that &quot;Abashi&quot; ass to being hand-cuffed to a chair till he leveled a non-Twink warrior to 50 with the old conditions in EQ (the ones he defended). All spawns camped to death by soloing classes, no one grouping because exp was easier soloing for all but a few classes (while he lied and said it wasn't happening).<br />
<br />
{From parses on this board, Warriors are doing more base dps compared to knights, with the same weapon, and outclass them when using better (dbow/eoe vs gboc).

Neither are rangers, in actual situations, in best circumstance parses (read: not actual), they jump around a bit.}<br />
<br />
You are just another Knight, posting on the WARRIOR board (and your posts should be removed just like the Paladin board does) as you are anti-Warrior, pro-Knight. SK's are doping WAY more DPS than Warriors, or the high end guilds wouldn't be stocking up on them. In NO situation should a Paldin out-DPS a Warrior, but with Slay Undead it will happen on undead mobs. You know why it wasn't nerfed back. BECAUSE THE PALADINS THREW A HISSY FIT AT THE IDEA! Well Warriors have learned the lesson well, bitch often, bitch LOUD and get fixed!<br />
I also think groupability of Necromancer and Druid should be HIGHLY nerfed as both classes and you can quote me on this &quot;set EQ to easy mode, leveled with no challenge and then the babies are upset the classes who actually had to take time to level get more exp now.&quot;<br />
I have played both a Druid and a Warrior to high level, and you know what?! The Druid OWES 40 days difference in playing time from 1-50 to be made up 51-65! Thats right, pay for it early or later but ALL classes should reach 65 at about the same rate.<br />
<br />
I guess it is a bit much to actually think I should get something for a game I PAY for not to have bugs. WoW is being scrutinized  for any bugs extensively (unlike lame ass EQ). I trust Blizzard but we all know not to trust Sony or before that the original &quot;programmers&quot; who release half assed products with bugs and glitches, then fix caster stuff but refuse or deny the existance (lies) of melee bugs. I LOVE melee chars, I HATE the guy in a dress, so I EXPECT my game to at the very least have some balance. EQ was set up for the pro-caster crowd, in fact many have called it &quot;Caster Quest&quot;. Kiting, Charm, AE groups, etc are BS and should be NERFED to hell and back!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Heimdall-RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Two of my friends went to the FV server so they'd have much less competition for spawns, they made a CLR/ENC duo.  They routinely take down mobs as a duo that full groups without a CLR/ENC can't touch.  They took down Untel'Dak.  Try doing that without a CLR and ENC.  <br />
<br />
I think every server had any number of CLR/ENC poacher duo's in BoT.  You know the ones... they'd paci into the Boss area, and use a charmed pet to lift your named while you were clearing the area around him, and/or recovering and rebuffing to engage.  We all know Charm is overpowered.  <br />
<br />
Maybe they'll work on it, maybe they won't, but it doesn't generally speaking relate to warrior balance.<br />
<br />
As for the pally board deleting Pro-warrior posts, and deleting this guy's posts... relax.  Try and be the bigger man.  After all the innate HP gap has us as bigger tank by at least three or four percent.  <br />
<br />
I just want to know how we went from being the masters of melee to being a knight without the spells and toys.  Warriors are supposed to have a noticeable advantage in melee.  I don't care if Pallies and SK's can beat me in a duel... there's no accomplishment in beating up a completely gimped PVP/solo class.  Kinda like playing Dark Ages of Stealthalot.</div></div><hr />

No the one talking smack is you. You flamed me first, I flamed you right back. I was in PRIMORDIUM and ORDER OF ETERNAL MOON when I got my loot. I joined a smaller guild because I am quitting this game and going to WoW. Like many other, EQ is a dead horse, we are here waiting for WoW (go to FoH boards http://fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?threadid=8135 ). You want to look at some boards? My friends from Primo and OEM are in DIVINE CRUSADE http://www.divinecrusade.org/  check them out! I was also level 62, deleveled for plat, you get your facts straight. I was one of the first level 61's on Tunare. Due to work and RL (plus the Diablo 2 patch) I stopped playing EQ for 9 months. I have a Yelinak's Talisman and NToV stuff (including unquested armor), means I was there, huh? A level 56th probably didn't do that. I was playing EQ in 1999, I am sure you weren't. BTW, went to your guild page, HoT? Gee, I was doing that in Primordium more than two years ago! Right back at you...<br />
Get this, every patch these so called &quot;Programmers&quot; put out is a complete screw job that crashes servers for a week after. They are hacks and have not one iota of skill compared to the originals. Knights got buffed to hell and back right after Kunark, and some was called for, some not. Then they got buffed up on every expansion after. Well PoP was finally to much, PURE MELEE DID NOT KEEP UP ON DPS according to Sony spokesman themselves. Then patch after patch went by, and finally some of the Warriors here got fed up and called a Walk out: <br />

The last posted to prove some people actually closely scrutinize to see if their class is going to get screwed in the next expansion. Warriors got complacent and look what happened.<br />
Try posting some FACTS, your BS may then carry some water.:mad: BTW&lt; shows how badly informed you are, agnostic, nice choice! I won't call you a 15 year old, many 15 year olds are WAY more knowledgable than you. Post some Official facts proving Knights haven't closed the gap between them and warrior in tanking ability to the point were they became the preferred tank. The patch now being done to fix pure melee is CORRECT and LONG overdue! DPS WAS lagging behind, disprove it with Official Sony Dev posts or shut up. BTW&lt; put you on IGNORE, to ignorant of EQ facts and where to find them to be bothered with.<br />

{&quot;It's far easier to identify simple issues with mana to damage ratios for spells and things like that than it is to review an entire set of classes. And, while this won't make anyone happy, keep in mind that we are not saying that we'll make dramatic changes here.} <br />
Hire some real Devs is my advice, this group has never understood melee, they play the guy wearing a dress.</div></div><hr />

Of course, you're a Warrior who is used to being chained to certain items, so I understand why you can't translate to classes for whom everything is a LUXURY instead of a NECESSITY.<br />
<br />
Despite Partha's attitude in his post, he does touch upon smoething rather important - Warriors are often chained to very few items, whereas all the other classes are not.<br />
<br />
Makes a hell of a difference in prices on said items ... like Blade of Carnage and Cobalt Bracer - Old items both, only warriors want them, and rather expensive.<br />
<br />
LDoN have helped with that.<br />
Incite have helped with it too.<br />
<br />
I would still like to see more things done to open up the choices of warriors. We are supposed to be all about getting gear, yet have to reject at least half of the weapons these days. And that's kinda absurd in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

please show me in this post or any post made by the devs that a Paladin should EVER out-DPS a Warrior, it specifically states they should NOT, EVEN SITUATIONALLY. You got a spellbook, you should maybe ever do 90% of Warrior DPS vs undead and 80% otherwise. Sony went to nerf Slay undead and Paladins threw a fit, they were wrong, you are wrong. Thats the plain truth. All the SKs avoid any mention of DPS with pet and spells, they only show melee to keep their superior DPS quiet, they know theirs should be less too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Barraind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">That post takes into account what could have happened normally, had slay worked with PoP critical aa's (fury of the ages). It does not.<br />
<br />
To outdamage a warrior, I have to hit a virtually impossible streak of slays (1/14,600 occurance) AND, those slays must be 70% 6k+ (same chance of being min slay as max slay) <br />
<br />
(yeah i busted out a calculator) A paladin wielding Vanazir + 150dd with ~1400 raw atk + fa + fero + billy + sot + sop + SoV + damage shields + chaining (30secs between use) a 21.7 dps spell + 5dps proc has a  2.217^-16 (.0000000000000002217)% chance of doing 1.1 dps over a similarly geared warrior.<br />

yes, in that case you should. But it remains at the lower end (where most players are), Slay Undead was tilting the DPS balance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">I deleveled, remember, and I also don't bother with PoP anymore that is filled with high exp zones with undead. Some LDoN zones (and I am in the 1-7 level area to compete with Paladins with slay undead) have large percentages of undead, but I can avoid them as there is plenty to do in LDoN.<br />
Remember, I am a casual player, I am not going to play this game as a career. Most players are in this situation. It is Sony's decision to make only really decent two handers available outside LDoN. Anger 3 is not insertable to a two hander (due to poor decisions by the Programmer, unless my info sheet is wrong). The simple solution is add a buyable two hander somewhat on par with at least VT stuff, or an LDoN one. <br />
Of course this doesn't bother the hard core raider, but why does Sony continue devoting so much of its resources to 1% of the players? WoW will steal a large percentage of the player base as everyone will start out even, and raiding EQ style is not part of the game. <br />
Talisman is a Time guild, I adventured with some members. Why was a (then) 55th level with Time capable guild people? If you said they were twinks (what I first thought) do not collect $200. They quit EQ because of the large amount of time required to raid to get any decent equipment. LDoN gave most classes the ability to get decent stuff. I have no arguement with the armor available, it is better than the Skyshrine armor I have, it is the lack of a decent two hander and the decision (I think obviously to punish Warriors), that Anger 3 is not insertable in a two hander.<br />
BTW, as a casual Diablo 2 player, my Barbarian and Necromancer have some of the best items available. My Barbarian can solo the hardest mob in the game, Diablo spawn. It is not lack of ability in EQ, it is lack of time which most people will have. I and many others have a problem with Sony continuing to devote so much for so few to benefit.</div></div><hr />

And there were even times when I thought SU was bugged as i never saw a single one after several hours in undead crypts of HoH.

It is actually possible to augment a Two handed weapon with Anger III proc.<br />
<br />
Here's the augments that can be used :<br />
<br />
Marble Sphere of Ire (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=42179) - Type 4 augment.<br />
Radiant Marble Sphere of Ire (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=42204) - Type 8 augment (Plane of time weapons).<br />
<br />
You will see no restrictions on weapon type. :)<br />
<br />
And for the casual gamer on a tight budget, an augmented Greatstaff of Thunder (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=24799&amp;slot1=42179) is a great weapon.<br />
Heck, it has a 1:1 ratio, which is pretty damn good and will do a good job at holding aggro in the casual gamers group.</div></div><hr />

Sorry,  but I have to call &quot;prove it!&quot; on the 5-10% in straight melee thinggy (and no,  I don't mean you with your GSoT vs a knight with Ssra/Tier3 weaponry and some vengence gear).  <br />

Not sure what kind of DPS knights put out honestly...  but for comparison sake I average bounce between 90-120 DPS on most mobs I fight according to parses with EQWatcher evolution and with EQ Companion.  I don't think either program is really that accurate but both parse out about the same.  I haven't programmed procs into either so those don't get parsed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
need to realize that in the xp world of EQ, plate tanks are getting going out of bussiness, we're not wanted or needed.  We literally just take up group space that could be used by a dps class.  In LDoN any non plate wearing wannabe tank will suit fine and outdps us (me anyway), buff the group, slow/haste, etc specially since the mobs dont hit hard enough.  While LDoN hard missions were getting plate classes only as the tanks, its wearing down, itemization has caused leather/chain to tank just fine.  Wouldnt it make sense to just get a chanter, druid, and FOUR nukers and AE (soon, anyone wielding weapons or meleeing is not needed) in normal LDoN than puling mobs 1 by 1?  After all, its all about dps.  <br />
<br />
Look ahead.  Knights are crossing paths with what use to be WAR only tanked bosses.  leather/chain (and even some cloth) are tanking in xp groups in LDoN/elementals, and as youve already seen even tanked Time bosses.  All it takes is more guilds to farm elementals/Time, and AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>Heimdall-RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">That's not Class Balance, that's Game balance which isn't what this board is supposed to be used for, though you have somethimng of a point.  Its a general malaise of which War vs Knight is just a symptom.<br />
<br />
The problem with balancing the mobs vs the tanks- The gap between high end and mid to low end plate tanks is just too great.  What would be challenging for a 65 24AA 7750hp warrior to tank would be trivial for a 65 240AA 8500hp ranger or monk.<br />
<br />
It was less obvious in PoP because of the flag and tier seperation-Though a number of people who were overdressed for BoT were/are the ones primarly involved with poaching nameds.<br />
<br />
And GoD will only make it worse. <br />
<br />
However as I said at the beginning of this post, this is about Warriors compared to Knights, and the point still stands that warriors are still not balanced when compared to knights.  You can claim All plate classes are worthless if you want, but that doesn't remove from warriors the obligation to make sure we're balanced in relation to knights so that when SoE DOES get around to rebalancing Plate Tank classes vs DPS classes, Warriors and Knights are in the proper perspective.</div></div><hr />

I said a statement, I'll say it again.<br />
AGGRO LOCK is BAD.  Its bad that its in the game. Whining that it's there wont help anything. <br />
Giving aggro lock to warriors MORESO then we have is BAD. <br />
<br />
With incite and spirit of rage , Along with the upcoming melee balance part 2, Life is good for us, Were back in prime time. WE dont need anything more. <br />
<br />
We have the tools to make things work for us. <br />
When endurance is added to items we will be gold. Pure solid gold. Maybe a few tweaks, Maybe they can make furious bash shields work with the incite line. <br />
Other then that we dont need anything else. <br />
<br />
Warriors dont need to do uber DPS, That isnt our job<br />
We dont need , But we can want more mitigation. <br />
We definitely DO NOT need aggro lock more so then we have.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you said FB work with incite?&quot; <br />
Yes I did , Because furious bash is in the game to increase taunt on spells and bash's. Well incite is coded as a spell and should work with Furious Bash. Im not asking for anything new, just for something in the game to work as intended with the warriors new &quot;spell like abilities&quot;<br />
<br />
Now crawl back in your hole Doom, Or say your sorry, Cuz I sure the hell aint no knight, I work at aggro for a living kid. <br />
PS If you wanna bounce magelo's around take a peek at mine, I aint uber but I could sure kick your ass.<br />

Kadah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Heimdall-RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">I disagree Kadah.  Well depending on what you define as NEED and WANT.  Warriors, to balance against knights NEED more.  Unfortunately what works to balance high end warriors doesn't work for low to mid geared warriors.  However, adding both to warriors doesn't put either out of balance... adding more HP to low end warriors gives them a boost and doesn't detract from high end warriors that are essentially beyond HP concerns.  Adding more mitigation helps balance high end warriors and low end warriors are fighting such low end mobs they wouldn't notice it anyway.  HOWEVER As it currently stands 5% mitigation doesn't begin to equal out ot just the direct heals/taps in knight spellbooks, let alone the utility in those books.<br />
<br />
I don't want an Agro lock.  Hell I think the whole group system is totally FUBAR'ed right now.  Its like the original EQ model was in a fire and now its melted out of shape.  Think about the mobs you fight.  How long does your chanter live against an unslowed add?  How long does the shaman live when a slow is resisted?  Agro lock caused most of that.  Casters haven't gotten a defensive skill increase since Kunark, nor have they needed one.  If you want to take away agro lock, and make agro management a skill again, you have to give casters more survivability.  And smooth out the streaky nature of taunt.   A caster has to be able to realistically survive a few rounds of combat without generating frenzy agro after round two.</div></div><hr />

Come on guy lets keep it to reality here. Leather (aka monk/druid) tanking hard ldons as a matter of course (and I mean not the l33t 1pct of Time equipped monks/druids)?  Is this what you meant to say?<br />
<br />
adding more HP to low end warriors gives them a boost and doesn't detract from high end warriors that are essentially beyond HP concerns. <br />
<br />
Huh?? 65 with 150aa and I have HP concerns...not sure I see the validity of this logic.<br />
<br />
How long does your chanter live against an unslowed add? How long does the shaman live when a slow is resisted? Agro lock caused most of that. <br />
<br />
The enchs I know use that uber rune thingie and manage to boggle mobs before they get creamed.  Shamans I know have a fast root up and jiggle out of the way.  Both classes generally know how to work with warrs in my exp.  Not sure what point you are trying to make....take away agro lock and casters will get killed?  They are alot more versatile than that in my experience.<br />
<br />
Warriors, to balance against knights NEED more<br />
<br />
I think the next frontier of this *more* is with itemization and + END being added.   Would be nice if they reinstated a HP gap as you mention...not holding my breath though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">*shrug* I see that you only want more HP for the sake of having more HP.  It will serve no purpose besides giving you warm fuzzies.  No exp group is going to care if you have 8K, 9K, 10K HP, 11K HP.<br />
<br />
If you believe adding more HP is going to make Warriors work then you clearly missed the point of the last round of changes.  HP is not a problem for Warriors.  Yet somehow more HP is going to fix what is broken.  You've lost me there and its why I suspect you just want it for the sake of lourding it over another class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>Heimdall-RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">I have 8500.  That's enough for me.  I have friends who hit 7500 buffed.  That's not enough for them.  I'm not looking to add HP to warriors for my sake, but for the ones who aren't even as well geared as I am.  The whole point I've been trying to make about the HP gap was during Kunark it was more about the class and less about the gear.  Now its all about the gear.  And with the same gear you end up with Spellbooks making knights more desired than warriors.  5% mitigation doesn't even offset the Heals/taps that knights have, let alone their utility spells, etc on BoT Krigers.  I imagine it gets worse on spiders in PoV, or Trees in PoN.  Of course, I'm trying to balance all warriors vs all knights, not just you vs me.<br />
<br />
Flair I have a 65 shaman.  On a truly challenging mob, a resisted slow can equal a very pancaked shaman if the cleric isn't paying attention.  My shaman is in Full Ornate and moderate other gear.. I think he hits 5K buffed.  A resisted slow against an LDON hard mob more often than not means that by the time round 2 is over, he's dead.  Especially if there's more than one mob- Then the shaman goes into frenzy agro and it just gets worse.  I don't care how fast your root is, 3K an unslowed round against a 5K toon is a dead toon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">Which is exactly why Aggro lock is needed.<br />
<br />
High end Game mechanics says :<br />
<br />
-- Spells always have a 5% chance of being resisted.<br />
-- If Slow is resisted, the Slower is dead unless lucky or aggro lock.<br />
-- Warriors do not have aggro lock.<br />
-- Lowering Knights aggro to the same of warriors does not change the other game mechanics.<br />
-- rebalancing all the content where the need for aggro lock is a problem is not a financial sound idea.<br />
-- Giving Warriors Aggro lock is the cheapest solution.<br />

AGGRO LOCK is BAD.  Its bad that its in the game. Whining that it's there wont help anything. <br />
Giving aggro lock to warriors MORESO then we have is BAD. <br />
<br />
I agree, but, most on this board didn't and Knights would NEVER allow it to happen.<br />
<br />
With incite and spirit of rage , Along with the upcoming melee balance part 2, Life is good for us, Were back in prime time. WE dont need anything more. <br />
<br />
Balance part2? When? The Programmers cancelled the stuff on Test, and I (and most melee) have very good reason not to trust them. Sony's people openly admitted they are clueless about melee hire some people with a clue!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u115"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p115">I think many of you are missing what I tried to say :<br />
<br />
 - Removing aggro lock would make a bunch of encounters pretty much impossible.<br />
 - That would be bad for business.<br />
 - Rebalancing stuff to work without aggro lock costs mucho $$.<br />
 - SOE wants money.<br />
 - Cop outs are cheap.<br />
<br />
Care to make a guess on what will happen ?<br />
<br />
<br />
As for upping casters defense skills .. well, I could agree a little with clerics, since they after all are a Plate armor class, but even then it should be very minor upgrades.<br />
<br />
Heck, I play a Cleric myself and know how it feels being one-rounded.<br />
So why don't I support more defensive skills for casters ?<br />
<br />
 - Tank Mage syndrome<br />
<br />
That's something we REALLY don't want in EQ.<br />
Tank Mages are worse than aggro lock, since they cancel out our class entirely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u116"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p116">It's easy to get rid of aggro lock, and tune events around it.  That's what things like memblur, slow, or aggro debuff does.  Warrior, being the baseline class any encounter is tuned around, will always find that should SoE deems this encounter require some extra attention, the mob will always find some way to circumvent their ablity to aggro.  So no it's not impossible to tune this game without aggro lock.  Plenty of encounters exist that's design to take aggro away from Warriors.  <br />
<br />
The problem is that the said events aren't tuned in mind to take away a Knight's ability to generate aggro equally.  If every uber just starts procing long term silence and/or single target drain 4000 mana/500 mana/tick you would see Knight tanking disappear overnight, and all would be good in Warrior land (well, maybe people would try to pump a SK/Pal and get off another Fear/Stun, but I kind of doubt that).  You can even apply this to a lower level, i.e. instead of having a Crystalline Golem randomly procing a 250 DD have it proc 250 DD and 250 mana, and suddenly Knights won't be locking these mobs down effortlessly.  There are giants in PoS that procs a 1500 unresistable mana drain.  I can't imagine Knights would want to tank those things even if HP/AC isn't an issue.  <br />
<br />
So no tuning encounters that gets rid of aggro lock isn't that difficult.  They probably just haven't really thought about tuning encounters around Knights.</div></div><hr />

Hrmm that has to be high risk.  To be honest Heim...if I go toe to toe with an unslowed high risk mob for a period of time I have issues myself (1550ac, 8500ish hps).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u118"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p118">Getting rid of agro and not replacing it with something comparable (like true object collision) would mean the death of any melee defense.<br />
<br />
With the way EQ works, the only reason left to keep tanks in the game is to allow casters to operate somewhat safely.  Kill that reason (by either by making casters stronger defensively or break how tanking works) and you have a set of classes with low DPS that do nothing but be the last class standing during a wipe.<br />
<br />
The ones who claim solid agro control is bad are funny.  If I am assigned to protect some one weaker in the raid or group, I will use everything at my disposal to do so.  You will have to kill me off before the thing gets a chance to hurt the weaker player.  But some of you would rather just do your job haphazardly for &quot;fun&quot; which is more or less stepping aside to let the monster beat on anyone it wants.  Yeah...that sounds like a tank doing their job in stellar fashion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u119"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p119">I agree with Aeka on this one.  More HPs won't do anything to help warriors with XP groups or raids.  We already have enough HPs to do our jobs there.  Our big issue used to be aggro control.  With Incite it's still an issue but much less so than before.  The only issue I see for warriors at the moment is lack of utility.  Knights are close enough to our HP, mitigation, and DPS that the massive utility advantage they hold over us doesn't make sense.  <br />
<br />
It would be unbalancing to make us so much better either offensively or defensively to make up for the utility that knights have so the only solution is to close the gap in utility.  I'm not asking for the full range of abilities that they get through spells but some on demand stuff like snare, stun, root, maybe a skill that adds a short duration offensive or defensive boost to the whole group, maybe some type of crippling skill that lowers mob offensive skills, etc.  <br />
<br />
I don't want any form of heal or res and whatever utility skills we do get should offer about the same proportion of utility vs knights as they have tanking skills and offensive power in relation to us.  So if knights have 90% of our offensive and defensive skills we should have roughly 90% of the utility that knights have.  If it's 80% then we should get 80%.<br />
<br />
Obviously some of those skills will overlap like snare, root, and stun.  I'm hoping that some of the other stuff will be unique to pure melees so we stack better with hybrids.  Stuff like offensive or defensive debuffs on mobs or offensive or defensive group bonuses.  Call it Rallying Cry or Battle Tactics or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u120"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p120">I partially agree with Aeka.<br />
<br />
As a Warrior, I intentionally signed up to MT. I expect to always have a HP and mitigation advantage.<br />
<br />
As a Warrior I didn't sign up to exchange any part of my Tanking abilities for buffing, healing, or nuking.<br />
<br />
But, with clever use of disciplines, procs, and right click effects I can do things that I would not be able to do otherwise that while useful still does not make me a powerful melee/caster hybrid.<br />
<br />
We could never be given the HP's and mitigation necessary to equal the value of a Paladin's (for example) spellbook. No other class would dare to get near mobs.<br />
<br />
As compensation for the survivability we don't get, to make our class more interesting to play, and to address things like the groupability issues where our excess survivability has no value, it's perfectly fine for SoE to provide us with additional disciplines and on-demand abilities.<br />
<br />
However, it is NOT a spellbook and should never be used as an excuse to close the gap between Warriors and Knights.<br />
<br />
We signed up to MT. They signed up to melee (which has been expanded to include Tanking) and cast spells.<br />

Yes I think casters should get a minor definive adjustment.  They have been dealing with the same skill caps in that area since before Kunark, and grind mobs now hit for, and put out more damage than RAID mobs did in that time period.<br />
<br />
I'll grant that a level 52 shaman slowing a level 66 grind mob should be one round-ed.  But a 65 shaman having a failed slow shouldn't be.  No yellow GRIND mob should be able to one round any character in the game.<br />
<br />
I can see how you wouldn't think more HP matters Khumak.  You're cap'ing CH before buffs.  What about the VAST majority or warriors hanging at 5K pre buffs?  They probably buff out at around 7500.  Increasing the innate HP gap for them can put them at ~8K to 8500 allowing them to have an efficiency advantage over knights in their same gear level.  For warriors already over that level you'd have to do it with a mitigation bonus.</div></div><hr />

Thats what I see people shouting for warriors to have, and WE DO NOT NEED IT.<br />
<br />
At the moment with gear + incite + spirit of rage we have what we need to get aggro and sustainably hold it.  Now I'll grant that there are some small tweaks that still need to be made (Spirit of rage down to maybe 20ish minutes, EB shields working with incite etc) <br />
<br />
However baring that we are good as gold, Now some people say thats unreliable tanking, But hello. Tanking should never be a &quot;guarenteed&quot; thing. That lets casters be lazy and blame us on their own short comings.<br />
<br />
Shamans, Enchanters etc like to chain slow, which in old day EQ would have got them kicked from group's, however today even some of the best warriors / knights want them to do so.<br />
<br />
Why? more productive xp, and yet were asking for the silliest shit to make the game even more unstable and easier then it is by asking for &quot;guarenteed aggro&quot; We dont need it.<br />
<br />
We have more mitigation now, Thats great sure we can want a bit more, I'd like to see us have 5% more. So we have a solid 10% mitigation lead before Vie etc. Like we used to have. <br />
<br />
And yes I hope there will be a melee rebalance part 2, Part 1 improved us greatly for all you naysayers. Yes We had a long dark run, But SoE has given us the tools , So shut the fuck up and lets see what they do instead of the &quot;opening&quot; system. Maybe more disc's, Maybe more on demand abilities like incite?  <br />
<br />
Not many have seen the gem they have given us in the system we have, They can now throw in and tweak us like casters by adding more on demand stuff. And that is a bright light in a dark time indeed. <br />
<br />
So let's see what else comes down the way for us, Never know may be some cool shit indeed.<br />

Sometimes you don't even get a cleric or a slower or both and it'd be a good idea not to get 7 mobs in at once even when everyone is time geared.  <br />
<br />
Casters suck at pulling.  I don't ever want one to pull really because all they do is bring back a named and run around in a circle and then die.  I don't care if it's single because they usually die in the process and then complain either the clerc wasn't healing or if it's the cleric that died they will find something else to complain about.  If you want to bring a train back then let me, the person with most HPs in the group, do it.  I guess Enchanters are the exception but my guild's low on enchanters, so I don't group often with them let alone seeing them pull.

I would too Doom.  Because I'd have done everything I wanted to in EQ.  I would have been a godsend for just about any guild.  Cleric healing, chanter buffing/CC with my skill?  :p  But seriously, between being a much less common yet equally necessary class for guilds, and being able to two box a large number of mob targets that full groups couldn't handle conventionally, combined with getting in a good guild for raid targets I can't two box...  Eq would have been more boring than it is much earlier.</div></div><hr />

That is so true, been in groups with Ele flagged players (5 of them and one of me), and they just charged everything a few party members died, I died 3 times hehe, most fights were ping ponging etc etc.  But none of them took the adv seriously at any point in time.<br />
<br />
On the other hand was grouped with a couple of Time Geared guys and their alts, they controlled the pulls  did everything by the book took us 40 mins (not fast) but everything went perfectly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u136"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p136">It all depends on your group setup.  I've been in pickup groups where a normal adventure took longer than 40 mins and resulted in some deaths.  I've also been in well tuned LDON hard groups where nobody dies and we finish one every 25-30 minutes with a 10 minute break in between waiting for another adventure to become available.<br />
<br />
The difference between a well balanced, well geared group of skilled players vs a group of twinks in crappy gear playing alts while watching Baywatch is like night and day.<br />

In a good group LDON normal adventures are a total joke and LDON hard adventures are easy.  In a bad group normal adventures are challenging and LDON hard is nearly impossible.</div></div><hr />
