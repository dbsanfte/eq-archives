2-3 strong groups of what level?  What gear?  18 level 65s in elemental gear is a lot different than 18 people ranging from 60-65  in velious/ornate.<br />

Off the top of my head, and until you give us something to work with...<br />

Acrylia Embedded Visor is also a great choice, but the other loot she drops is utter crap -- its hard to get a group there</div></div><hr />

Oops, I was thinking it dropped from Vallon.  You're right, of course</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 group or less...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Dozekar quests are your best bet.<br />
<br />
I have the Silver Charm of Tranquility auged out to 45ac 100hp +8 all svs.  Still isn't as good overall as, say, the Talisman of Vah Kerrath, but those kind of stats, especially on your  neck, is certainly nothing to sneeze at.  It's like wearing a Vindi BP outside of the chest slot!  =P<br />
<br />
Lcea could definitely be killed by 2-3 groups for the 40ac 100hp mask she drops, but don't EVER rely on something of that rarity to ever grace your magelo.  Bar none, it's the 2nd best mask in Luclin next to the Aten mask (50ac 125hp), and it's chances of dropping make the Shattered Emerald of Corruption look like grains of sand while walking along the beach.  Amazing mask, and amazingly rare.<br />
<br />
Besides, why would you possibly want to kill Lcea anyways?  If you can kill Lcea, you can kill Seru, and acquiring the Arx Key is quite simple these days.  Quite simply put it, the RvR comparison between Lcea and Seru is like the temperature difference between the South Pole and the Sahara Desert.  And while you're at it, you might as well finish that quest for the Sigil Earring of Veracity - Something you need Lcea's favor for. ;)<br />
<br />
Anyhoo, back to Dozekar.  The Silver Mask of the Slayer quest achievable through Dozekar is one hell of an awesome reward.  It has great ac (25), solid hp (80), and good svs (+7 all).  It may take you a while, but it's something you can achieve with less than a full group, provided you have a cleric and shaman tagging along.  Aug it out to 35ac and 80hp and I'd say you have yourself one bitchin' mask.</div></div><hr />
