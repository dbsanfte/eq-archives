<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haladan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We tried the stone ring in PoE yesterday, but didnt get the named to spawn somehow.  We single pulled the Mound of rock(the 4 red cons(sp?)).  The 3 first regened up and returned, while the 4th was killed. Then nothing happened...<br />
The 3 that returned stood there and we could not agro them, and we could not make anything happen.  Anyone know if its a bug or there is a time limits on something so we could have failed?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds like it was bugged to me my guild has done that ring a couple times never actually killed A Mound of Rubble and I don't think there is a time limit if there it's it's a couple hours at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>boilerterry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Are you sure the ring was &quot;up&quot; just because you can trigger the event, does not mean the loot dropping mob will pop, he is on a 3 day timer (like 99% of PoP)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haladan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, the ring was up.  And we have done it and gotten PH earlier. Just didnt spawn rock monstrosity.. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dinekus Aleswig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You killed the 4th one and that screws up the ring.  I believe the 4 running back is what triggers the next part of the ring.  By killing the 4th, you ended the ring right there.  I have seen this happen before where someone killed one of those 4 and the ring just died out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haladan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks. Guess we better make sure that dont happen again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's definately not bugged... we did it today with no issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's been that way forever.  I remember killing one of them two different times before we decided to be start being more careful. Just be careful not to kill them if your dps doesn't suck.</div></div><hr />
