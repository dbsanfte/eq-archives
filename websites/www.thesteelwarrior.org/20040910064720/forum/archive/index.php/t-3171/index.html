<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Trast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is a few days late of course but I am still feeling the buzz from my guild's first Aten Ha Ra kill. The clerics were swift in killing me off with bandaid slow healing but my comrade in scales Cyrz and big old Bushka were able to take the four armed freak most of the way down. Finally I got up and around and was able to finish Aten Ha Ra off. We stomped on her corpse, the enchanter girls stole her leather outfits, and as we took our victory photos on her throne my guild awarded me this....<br />

Beers on me for a week! And the finest Overlord Stout for my friends Cyrz and Bushka for having all our backs.</div></div><hr />

I won a random (I kid you not :p) on one, week before last.  To say i was chuffed would be an understatement :) That's still like the third best BP in the game.<br />
<br />
Pick up VT raids are the win :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm surprised Trast, I didn't expect OC to last more than a couple of weeks and now you're done with VT.  It seemed like there was a new guild popping up every month on CT there for awhile...getting to Ssra and breaking up.  Good job holding it together.</div></div><hr />
