This board has helped me many times so here I come again with yet another question. I understand what /shield does, but I HATE this command. <br />
I'm fighting target, cleric heals, target goes after cleric and starts beatin the beejeezus out of him/her. I /shield. This does NO taunt, NO attack, nothing except take some of the damage cleric is getting. <br />
Am I missing something? This is crap. I would rather be beating on the target to get it's attention, unless of course the cleric really is in danger of dying. If not, let me try to get taunt back with damage. <br />
What good is /shield?<br />
Someone please help me with this. I've seen several people post how they really like this ability and I just don't understand why.<br />
Thanks,<br />

I am interested to see the results of this poll though, because my shaman friends tell me that I am the only warrior that ever shields them.</div></div><hr />

Its like defensive, on a cleric.  The one thing i dislike about it is that it seems to wear off immediatly after the person shielded loses aggro and in the case of a cleric, they usually heal themselves immediatly after losing aggro which nets them ever more of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CplTom</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the best ways i have found to use it is when i am not MT and the healer needs a little help befor they can get the compleat heal off . I just target MT , sheild him ( if he is below say 15 % life ) and then go back to bashing the mob . This easily gives the healer a few extra seconds to get spell off .</div></div><hr />

I thought, incorrectly it seems, that when I target someone and type /shield, I'm stuck doin nothing. I can taunt, hit, etc while shielding? This ability has a use?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I use it a lot but I know more warriors that dont use it (with a macro, or manualy assisting the mob) than warriors who are using it. And I agree with them that the range and duration doesnt worth it but heh... I still hit disarm to get every tiny scrap of aggro I could get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krowbar</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I usually just type out &quot;/shield player&quot; when someone gets summoned by a mob I'm on. That way I continue hitting the mob and they get shielded. Don't have to type the full name to pick it up, the name matching is the same as /target.<br />
<br />
For exp groups I make a few hotkeys on another keybank for cleric, shaman and chanter.  Also I tend to /shield the puller or another tank often to spread out the damage on a fresh pull of 3-4 mobs on hard.<br />
<br />
Also I experimented with a hotkey that did /assist and /shield but it was taking up a valuable hotkey spot and losing the target wasnt that useful especially if mezzes were being done so I stopped using it.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure about the value of shield beyond the original 12 seconds however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't have to have the person targeted while you shield them.  You just have to be within arm's-reach of the person.<br />
<br />
I have a couple ways of shielding:<br />
<br />
1) for the person who's most likely to get aggro and die (usually enchanter), I make a hotkey just for them, which says &quot;/shield Soandso&quot;.  I don't have to target them when I use this macro.  If it's a pickup group, then I also add a line saying &quot;I'm taking half of Soandso's damage for 24 seconds, stay near me!&quot;<br />
<br />
2) for everyone else, I have a generic /shield hotkey.  If I'm not getting hit and my taunt fails, then I assist the mob and hit the shield key to protect the person who's taking the beating.  Then I hit my &quot;return-to-previous-target&quot; key and continue fighting the mob as usual.<br />
<br />
When you use shield all the time, it'll be available every 2nd fight, pretty much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warram</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use it when I can, usually in multiple pull situations where I am not the Main Tank. Spider ring in PoAir is a good example. I usually hang back by clerics on the pull and if any go plowing into casters I'll try to /assist off them and /shield. If nothing goes back there I run up and attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can shield by typing /shield playername, or using a macro that does it and never lose target.<br />
<br />
The way I do it is to use a macro hotkey that goes<br />
<br />
/assist mob<br />
/shield<br />
<br />
This in conjunction with my &quot;toggle last two targets&quot; key means I'm only off of the mob for a split second.<br />
<br />
Most of the time it doesn't make much difference, but when you get it off on a hard-hitting mob and get your ass beat down it feels good.  Never hurts anything so I generally hit it any time someone besides me is tanking and taunt fails.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myst Darkwind</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye I use the same setup to shield Brutul. Really doesnt affect ability to get aggro back and slows down the damage on the shieldee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varalla</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never thought about typing it out.<br />
<br />
I have a shield hot key I always use.<br />
When I enter a group, I look at the classes (Or names if an aggro magnet sticks in memory) and edit the key to the person with the highest aggro in group.<br />
<br />
When I use it its only a simple click and does nae interfere with me DPS, aggro, or positioning.<br />
Im happy with the refresh time, but not the range.<br />
<br />
(I also noticed nae many warriors use the ability. I really dont know why)</div></div><hr />

/sh nam<br />

this shortcut thing is very useful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fighting banshee's in PoN last night, and being the warrior I am I of course was getting pealers off onto the shaman all night long.<br />
<br />
Fortuneately he's one of my officers so he's cool with getting hit :D<br />
<br />
Fighting mob....Fighting mob....<br />
Shaman Casts<br />
Slow lands (or is resisted)<br />
Mob peals for shaman<br />
Taunt, if it doesn't turn, hit shield hotkey<br />
Hit &quot;nearest NPC key&quot; for me that's &quot;e&quot;<br />
Resume fight, while the shaman gets hit for 70 instead of 280 on an unslowed mob (or something like that, can't remember numbers now LOL)</div></div><hr />

Warriors be wantin to know the results of this here poll so I'd like lots of us to vote. AND, I'll be usin /shield now that I know I can turn my attn back to the mob and still be shieldin our chanty/cleric, etc.  I really didn't know this. The /shield says something to the effect of &quot;target the person, type /shield and you will take some of their damage over a short period of time&quot;. Nowhere did it say that after targeting said person, that I could then turn my attention back to the mob and still be shieldin'. Thanks for all the great info. Especially good idea by Brutul. /assist mob /shield, but then what? Just start hittin mob again? I'm gonna guess so. <br />

unless your shield lands on the cleric you usually end up with the mob as a target again, this guarentees that you don't /shield the shaman that usually gets beat on when it's actually someone else standing by the shaman catching the beat down. if you don't land back on the mob it's just a matter of targeting quickly using the toggle target button (defaults to tab for most people.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gruda</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My usual xp group consists of a 65 druid (my husband), a 65 bard (RL friend), a 65 shaman (RL friend), myself, and then 2 more guildies or random pickup DPS people for some LDoN fun.   The shaman plays healer/slower, so I have a shield button dedicated to him.  If I need to, I can quickly go to my second bank of keys, where there is a /shield bardname.  If anyone else gets aggro (including my husband), I will do my best to get aggro back, but they are unlikely to get a /shield.<br />
<br />
Because I was playing with a steady group of RL friends, I got to do a bit of experimenting with my shield function.  I found that /shield does indeed have some aggro/hate component to it.   In fact, about 1/4 of the time, I could pull aggro off the shaman, following a slow, doing nothing but standing beside him, hitting the mob with my big non-proccing weapon, and not hitting /taunt.  Of course, it helps that he stands still while getting hit, instead of the normal caster habit of running around like a chicken with its head cut off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sutas Mu</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 01:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I usually have two shield hotkeys set up.  One is set at #9 for the slower and the other in #10 for the healer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use two keys, and /assist and a /shield.  I get into some unorthodox group line-ups (ENC * 2, SHM, DRU, CLR, and me is a typical lineup), and I find a dedicated /shield key to be more of a hindrance than a help.<br />
<br />
It buys me the time I need, it let's my group-mates breathe a little easier, and the people I group with can stand firm when I am trying to peel a MOB off them.  And that saves them a world of hurt and doubles the odds (at least) that I will be successful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kruscher</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 07:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tend to use /shield a lot.  Silly me has been typing it in, however.  That will change now that I know a little more.  I shield pullers on multiple incs, enchanters when they bounce mez or slow, healers when they get heal aggro, and paladins when they cant stop hitting their damn stun key and are soaking up the clerics mana like a sponge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Augustus</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 08:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use /shield a lot too. I usually set hotheys for the more popular targets for it (Druids, Chanters, Clerics...). I like the /assist better though. Might start using that more often now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pag0</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can also be used on raids, to buy the healers time to get a cycle of heals down, or if a debuffer/healer gets agro it's an easy way to buy them a few seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyndri</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, ya'll have me convinced that /shield is a good thing and that once Tandy hits 30 again she will be using it. Dunno if I said but I got her to 42 with agnostic, then realized the reallllly good armor is deity based so I deleted her (OUCH!!!) and started her again. My question is this, how should I set up my social? I want to be able to do as some of you have said, which is to /assist the mob, then /shield the player then go back to hitting the mob again. What would ONE hotkey look like in this scenario please?<br />
Thanks, Ya'll are a ton o'help!!<br />
Tandy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My hotkey goes:<br />
<br />
/assist<br />
/shield<br />
<br />
<br />
You can add a second /assist if you like, but if you are shielding an enchanter that is trying to mez another mob, they won't be happy with you.  For this reason I just hit my &quot;switch to last target&quot; key after using the /shield macro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There should be another choice in the poll that says &quot;I TRY to use it often and am usually out of range&quot;.  The only time I successfully use it is if I spend the time to look around and find the caster I want to shield and run accross the room so I'm in range to shield him.  At LEAST 90% of the time I try to shield someone they are out of range, especially on raids.  The range on this ability needs to be doubled at the least.</div></div><hr />
