Rightnow I have been using a rusty scimitar and a shield. Should I switch to a 2 handed weapon or duel wield? I am lvl 10 and I think I still have time to change to a different type.<br />

Use slam to get your bash skill up (troll, right?). When your skill maxes for that level, which should be your level times 5, plus 5, switch to a different weapon type. Don't worry if some get a bit behind, just do your best. You'll have more of a chance later when leveling slows down more. Stop using a shield when you get dual wield.</div></div><hr />

Generally the first thing i try to do is get a magical weapon for them.  Take the Great Divide stone in PoK.  Stand at the book and ask if anyone could spare one of the velium weps the giants drop.  Eventually, you get a couple different weps which is good for learning skills.  After you get a decent wep, head back to your home town and do the beginning armor quests for your class.  It make take some time but you'll end up with a decent set of armor and lots of tradeskill loots to sell in the Baz.  Keep all the Spider/ling silks, pelts, skins, swatches you find.  If you are in need of bags, go to Shadowhaven, which is on the moon near nexus.  In a small building near a couple tent looking things there is a gnome that sells toolboxes for 1gp.  He's near the south side of the zone in the human area.  You didn't say what race/diety you were.  If you are RZ there are some better weps you can loot from Kael that generally rot b/c they are  LORE.  GL and enjoy the game.  Ignorence is bliss really.</div></div><hr />

I am A troll on Fiorna Vay(SP)server. I was told that is a hard server to play on. I guess you can't get &quot;no drop&quot; items unless you are the proper level. I have no idea if that is true or not. I will start using some other rusty weapons I loot to get those skills higher.<br />

  Firona Vie server has almost NO no drop stuff. You can pretty much trade anything. Work on your newbie quest armor though, should be able to talk to some of the NPCs around your class trainer for the quests. It should give you a better weapon and some starting armor for killing some stuff you're already killing.</div></div><hr />

You probably can't afford it yet, but a goranga spiked club is a very cheap weapon on FV and will serve you well.<br />

I imagine if you can get to the zone in and hang out for a few hours and are willing to eat a few deaths while you wait, someone might just give you one.  Even on FV, they are lore and probably not worth making a special trip to the bank to get 2 if the person aready has one.  Be careful though if you do go there since its a 45+ zone (Maiden's Eye) and there usually are lots of trains there at the DSP zone.  Also if you assist anyone who is exp'ing there, the stuff will come after you from relatively far away because of your low level so keep a low profile and don't hit anything.</div></div><hr />
