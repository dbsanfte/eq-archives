<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been wondering lately what non-warrior alts some of you have and most enjoy playing.<br />
I've got one non-mule slot left on my account &amp; I'm trying to figure out what might be interesting.<br />
The two alts I most often play are a shaman and an SK. Neither suits me as well as my main, but both are very interesting.<br />
Of those, the shaman is pretty seriously into making his group function with max efficiency. He does a lot of thinking. The cool thing about him is that no matter what the make-up of his group, he can make the group more efficient. Usually what he does is not all that flashy, but I've noticed that the best players in any given group are usually the first to notice the effects of a well-played shaman. (Oh, AND he can SoW himself and OMG gate r00ls!).<br />
The SK (a troll) is a hoot because for various reasons he's very relaxing to play. Mobs hate him, he hates mobs. He dies easier than my warrior did at his level, but he cares less, heh. I'm not sure I'd like him as much as I do if I really wanted to build an MT, but he can tank and yes I admit it I get a level of enjoyment from Harm Touch all out of proportion to its actual effect.<br />
It seems to me that at one point it was very common for warriors to have a WIZ alt, but I don't know if that's still true.<br />
Obviously clerics and chanters are much in demand. Haven't tried a chanter; have a cleric but for some reason playing him hasn't really turned my crank so far.<br />
Guild needs, in this case, are not a concern--just looking for some hands-on experience from warriors about alts they've enjoyed. Might give some weight to an alt that is not expensive/difficult to gear up (I probably won't twink this alt much if any).<br />
And yes I have a warrior alt already, thanks.<br />
I realize that to a large extent a class that is a blast for one person might not suit another, but given that, what do you guys think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm not really an alt player.  Besides my cleric bot I don't have any characters I play even occaisionally, but the classes I have enjoyed from time to time are <br />
<br />
Druid - anti-warrior, they can do anything, escape from any situation, fill multiple roles in groups, get places quickly etc.  <br />
<br />
Enchanter:  Really fun class that I never really got around to playing, but the low-level chanters and bots I have had access to were both a lot of fun.  <br />
<br />
Mage:  Pure DPS class.  Nobody is as focused on destruction as a mage, and the pet is an interesting thing to play with.  Also fun to be able to summon various useful trinkets.<br />
<br />
I hated my shaman.  I don't like buffing, and shamans have way too many to keep track of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bashemz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i have a lvl 54 magician that i play off and on.  i usually play him when i don't have much time online and can't really get into a ldon or good exp group. Next to my warrior he is my favorite class to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Quato</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I really spend 98% of my time on my warrior but when I do need a break I have 2 alts I log on now and then.  One is a Paladin, hey I am still a warrior at heart.  The Paladin is pretty cool adding a lot of utility to the taking roll.  His priestly spell set is pretty nice when you want to solo some stuff.  The other alt I play at times is a Bard.  I feel the Bard is the most unique classes in the game and as such is quite fun to play.  You aren't really a caster yet you have all these awesome effects at your disposal.  Twisting is pretty fun to try to master and playing a Bard as an alt gives you a greater respect for the real Bards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Plumppoopsie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I started a lvl 1 warrior an put Helm of Rallos zek, BOC, Velium encrusted guantlets, boots of storm, Lodi belt, Fungi .....<br />
<br />
And boy was it fun, had to stop using when LDoN came out but was fun to fight reds and groups of mobs, and slaughtering them all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>The Cromn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I also rarly play an alt. Have a few old mains, 51 dru, 54 mage, 53 rogue. Like the rogue, but he`s detwinked atm. <br />
 Atm, I play an iksar necro level 29 as an alt. Like the soloability(nice change from a must group class warrior), like the generaly cool idea of an &quot;evil&quot; class and race, and like the necros diversity. Necro can be played a few ways, Dot, DD, fear kite, life taps, life taps over time, inv, FD,e tc etc. Only problem with necro is they are the least geared twords group play of all classes. But, I wanted a soloer for the change of pace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When I do, it's usually my necromancer. <br />
<br />
<br />
I really, really, enjoyed the wizard class, up untill the point of the kei fix. Having to med really blew and wasn't fun at all, so I quit him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have an alt turned bot Monk that I play.<br />
<br />
I solo'd him from 1-51 on my account, grouped him with friends through 56, then recently switched him to a new account, and do LDoN's grouped with my War, while my bot enchanter and cleric sit outside the group. Nice XP, nice cash, and the points aren't horrible either. He's presently 58.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, there's my cleric bot, but that doesn't really count as an alt to me, I play her 90% of the time with my warrior.  In demand, class is straight forward in its role; healing, and being the best at it.  Simple and always needed, big pluses to me.  <br />
<br />
I also have a 64 druid, I LOVE being able to go somewhere and get something going regardless of having a group or not.  I also enjoy how flexible they can be.  Healing, charming, root rotting, quadding, there's a nice mix that doesn't get boring to me.<br />
<br />
My other character over 30 would be my beastlord, currently at 56.  I was dubious of the class at the start, but I gave it a try.  This has been the only hybrid class I've tried and LIKED.  Tried paladin, hated it.  Tried SK, yawn.  Tried bard, damn, my hands got sore in a hurry.  I like the variety, can pet cleric, slow for groups, tank if necessary, etc.  <br />
<br />
But when it comes down to it, I'd rather spit in the mob's eye and tank as a warrior.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have a 56 Druid, 53 Paladin, and a few sub-30 twinks.<br />
<br />
The Duid is intended to be for tradeskills and tracking mobs. I probably will level him up some more since his heals are pretty weak at his level. Other than that, they are nearly a perfect non-melee class. KEI, FT, and focus items have a huge impact (especially focus items).<br />
<br />
The Paladin is also a joy to play, but the fall off in level 50ish groups is dramatic. From 50 to 56, I'm pretty well convinced a well equipped Paladin can run rings around most Warriors. At that level, the raid game isn't hugely important and that advantages of the Paladin class are almost overwhelming. A VERY well-rounded melee class with no (afaict) obvious deficiencies.<br />
<br />
I've played low level Ranger, Bard, Enchanter twinks. Primarily this is in order to learn a little about how classes really are in groups and how some players can leverage advantages and paper over dificiencies. I've learned a bit, BUT<br />
<br />
It seems to me the low and mid level game is dying off. If you see 2 characters fighting, it's almost always someone PLing a twink. Groups are not easy to find.<br />
<br />
Other than Vox and Naggy, there is very little &quot;old school&quot; EQ left. A shame really. I'd kinda like to see SoE improve Old World group and raiding opprotunities, double the ZEM, improve loot tables, improve drop rates substantially, and protect that content only from bottom feeders. IMO there needs to be EQ for alts, twinks and casual players where guild progression takes a back seat to just logging in and having fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mukaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have a veritable horde of alts<br />
<br />
On my main server I have, in addition to my warrior, a 62 Beastlord with 46 AAs, 52 druid, 49 cleric, 31 shaman, 16 berzerker and a 14 necromancer plus the ubiquitous bazaar mule.<br />
<br />
I have an unknown number of alts on other servers ranging from lvl 5 - 25 including 5 ogres on test and one beastlord of each race on some other server.<br />
<br />
If I could get all that playtime in larger chunks than 2 - 3 hours at a time I might one day join a raiding guild but I don't see that happening anytime soon.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brannwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I play my warrior about 99.9% of my time in game.  She is my main and I love playing her.  But, when I do need a break, which isn't often, I have a 34 cleric I like to play.  It's a nice change of pace to be behind the battle line.  But I have found that I take on a completely different personality when I play the cleric.  I tend to be pretty quiet so that I can concentrate on keeping my group alive.  I will melee from time to time if I'm in a good group with my cleric, but mostly I sit, med, heal and occasionally root and pacify. My other alt is a level 8 mage that I fool around with sometimes.  I love the pet class and it is awesome to solo at this level and watch my pet chew through the mobs.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Only alt that I ever play is my 44th level druid. Talk about a chane in personality, he can do it all on his own, port, SoW, root/rot and quad, total soloer.  Some friends have lower alt groups and I have tried playing him in it and just doesn't work for me ... my druid is a solo class for as long as I can keep him that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I always soloed on my druid as well.  He is 51 and hasn't seen the light of day in close to a year (he's on Tarew).  Always liked kiting, and just the ability to travel and kill things without a group is a very nice break from the warrior life and I thought quadding was really fun.  In a group I always felt like either a gimped wizard or a gimped cleric though, solo is where he really shines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>TaiilChayser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">65 Rogue<br />
65 Shaman<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Meekrakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have a 65 Mage (57 AA's) that I consider an alt even tho she is my highest toon. I also have a 62 Enchanter (22 AA's) and a 61 Shaman (27 AA's) that are higher levels than Meekrakkin who I consider to be my main simply because I feel at home playing him...<br />
<br />
Other alts are a 56 Beastlord, 56 Bard, 50 Cleric, 47 SK, 46 Necro, 40 Monk and a few lower level toons...<br />
<br />
I enjoy them all but I'd rather be on my warrior standing up front bustin heads together  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My old main is now an alt, 62 Shaman with 14 AA. Switched when PoP came out and could not tank &quot;In teh face&quot; for expereince anymore. Main alt that I play now is a 52 troll Beastlord. At his level, he playes like the Shaman was advertised to be in the book that came with my original purchase of EQ Trilogy of &quot;Battlepriest&quot; Forced a Druid to 30 and hated every moment of it, re-geared my lower level Warrior with level 30ish gear like Crusty and such and been playing him a little more just to try and undo the 5 months of bad choices I made with him</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My only other one really is my Shaman that I Bot and they are as much of a team as 2 seperate characters since 90% of the time or more I play them both. The best is doing guild groups a lot I will leave the shaman outside the group as a 7th just to Malos and slow .  Whats nice with that is that not getting exp I dont feel compelled to contribute as much to the group and can take it easy. <br />
<br />
  The Shaman is a lot of fun to play, and I do enjoy running him alone sometimes in a group. Not having to 2 box means he can spend more time casting Canni and doing his thing and that can be fun as Shaman are so versatile. At least at the level I am not having to deal with the high end GoD game yet.<br />
<br />
  My only other real Alt is my Ranger. He was my first character as I loved being a ranger before EQ in Gemstone. But he is still only lvl 20 and though I keep thinking I should PL him up to at least 46 for tracking uses, I just never get around to doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have a mage now. Fun stuff!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Alts are a waste of time, money, and space.<br />
<br />
I have no alts above level 20 other then to whore them for tracking/muling</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have a 52 wizard and a 31 Bst that get my down time.Got my wiz to 46 before the KEI nerf so it was a blast all the way around.Mass Kiting is teh w1n.<br />
Beastlords are awesome, almost impossible to die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have a 65 enchanter and 65 cleric I 3box with my warrior a lot. Also have a 54 druid and 61 rogue I play when I am bored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Straythe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I box a 65 warrior &amp; 65 druid almost all the time.<br />
<br />
When I get sick of lfg on those toons, I log in my 63 chanter which I mostly have around for c3 for my druid now.<br />
<br />
Chanters are a blast, arcane rune and LDoN made him fun to play again since there's actually something to do now and he can take quite a bit of punishment with that non-reagent rune up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">My highest alt is a 49 druid.  I like playing her for a change of pace.  However I hate soloing! I'm too much of a social butterful.  In groups I almost inevitably end up being the main healer, and start yelling at people to control their agro, get to the back of the mob, let the tank do his job....  I'm a warrior at heart, always will be /shrug.  My other alts are an 18 necro, a 16 bard, and a 12 rogue.  I like them all, but I don't have time for alts really :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I usually bot my warrior now with my cleric after switching mains about 6 months ago.<br />
But its still fun to try out new classes.<br />
Played a berzerker to 33 but deleted him as i still see no use for this particular class.<br />
Then leveled my ranger to 51 (had abondoned him at 42 when guild left ssra where she was supposed to track) and started a beastlord (23 now).<br />
And there is still my 55 druid although she only went from 51 to 55 by being grouped with my bard when he swarmkited in PoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Grobie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I oocasionally play the cleric of my ex-GF (box her), and have our 64 druid (whom we used as port bitch back in the days when you had much downtime to travel)<br />
<br />
As my own &quot;alts&quot; (as in not bots) I have a 45 monk and 44 rogue and 35 frog wizzie :)</div></div><hr />

ive started assortment of alts and played other characters ranger, shammy, enchs, rogue, monk but none really took my fancy.<br />
<br />
recently though i started a necro as a joint twink project with a friend. by far the most fun class ive played so far, in terms of the different playstyles, whether soloing or grouped, bags of utility and its nice to put out some big dps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I dont delete characters so:<br />
when I started EQ I made a human pally<br />
that lasted till I lost all the gear in nasty place the &quot;Nectulos Forest&quot; ooooo at lvl 9 in the rive with piranhas :) all that uber cloth and rusty swords gone! and there was no one high enough and rich enough to have invis spell.<br />
<br />
Then I made erudite wiz he lasted me till 25 but spending 70% of the game time without actually seeing anything but the stupid book got anoying at that time and clarity was just not around back then.<br />
<br />
Ohh ya before picking wiz I was playing an erudite necro too, but as soon as I got to Qeynos some dude started harasing me thinking I am a chick cause I was playing female character. Following me buffing/pling. I didnt want him not to pl, but having a guy hit on me was screwy so I just stoped playing necro for about 2 years :)<br />
<br />
After book fiasco I diceded I dont want ANY spells so here comes troll war. Beeing bad ass and so much fun at lower levels when regen is uber and fighting nakid with rusty 2 yellow mobs falling uncotious and winning was so much fun that he became a keeper!<br />
<br />
till kunark thats all I played then I made a iksar monky that I played on and off ocasionaly.<br />
<br />
My brother then decided to take over pally so I've opened a new account and moved pally there. For who we camped uber Ghoulbane for 24 hours straight before it droped and I got my wiz into bind loop too while at it :)<br />
<br />
At some point my bro stoped playing so I had a practicly empty 2nd account so I thought that aint right... So here comes druid. At this point spell book was not as much hindarance anymore and clarity became norm. Still sitting still is not my thing. At some point I got a new comp and discovered the wonderfull world of EQWindows.<br />
<br />
Then I saw ppl with cleric/war duo having much easier time 2 boxing so I said what the hell lets try cleric. Got cleric to 48 and let me tell you damn... it was too damn easy and utility was not what I got used too.<br />
<br />
Then guild needed a mage for VT so I started lvling one got to 40+ burned out quit EQ :)<br />
<br />
Ohh ya and every time Bertox is down I play a monk on RZ :)<br />
<br />
So at the end of my career I had on Berotx:<br />
65war<br />
65dru<br />
55pal<br />
55monk<br />
49wiz<br />
damn its nice to have porters on each account!<br />
48clr<br />
40+mage<br />
and a bunch of every other class lvl 20-35</div></div><hr />
