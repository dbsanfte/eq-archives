<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timothian</div><div class="date">11-07-2004, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night I joined a group and noticed the enchanter in the group had their LFG up.  This appeared to be a new group forming up at the WoS zone in as it was not complete when I joined it.<br />
<br />
I sent a tell to the player to let them know they still had LFG up as I figured it was a mistake, but I was told that they were seeing what other options they had in case the group did not work out.  This player told me they were not accepting other invites yet.  I do not know if there was any prior history with this player and the other group members, but the cleric in our group was a good one that I had grouped with before, and I like to think I have a fairly good reputation in WoS and do not have problems tanking any of the camps in this zone.  <br />
<br />
This realy ticked me off.  To me it seemed as if the player was telling the group, &quot;I assume you are going to suck and I am ready to leave.&quot;    Yes, pick up groups often suck, but part of it is the players coming and going.  I veiw it as disrepectful of the players in the group.<br />
<br />
Well I made it clear in no uncertain terms that I was not pleased with the LFG and did not intend on grouping with this person again.   Anyway, the enchanter got mad at my coments, but no great loss as I am not sure if they were even contributing to the group.  As I was exchanging tells with the chanter on the subject, we got some mysterious adds in our camp that did not get mezzed and we wiped.<br />

Group was me another guild member and 4 others. So basically a pickup group. The cleric  and one other had to leave and it was not at primetime so not alot of people on. After about 5 minutes looking for a replacement for the cleric and a dps we find a necro LFG. Pick up the necro and tell him what the situation is, looking for a healer. A cleric in my guild logs in at this time so I get them to come on over but its gonna take her a couple mins to get food  KEI and stuff, just logged in and all. Tell the grp I found a cleric and are otw will be a couple mins. Necro does an OOC LFG while still in grp and puts up LFG tag. I asked him what was up ? He responds with well you guys are gonna suck I can tell. Well since I was group leader target Necro disband. Like I said earlier was not exactly primetime so necro can't find another group and sends me a tell asking if he can comeback in. Some people really have no clue.</div></div><hr />

Better than just getting pissed off and making up an excuse!<br />
<br />
Why the hell should I waste my time dying about 2-3 times because an important class isn't doing what it's supposed to be doing?</div></div><hr />

Nothing I picked up on would indicate it would be a bad group.  It had a nice composition too: warrior, cleric, chanter, monk, wizzard, SK, forget other, beast or shaman I think.<br />

It is disrespectful to continue grouping with folks if all your doing is marking time until asked to another &quot;better&quot; group.  <br />

My $.02, but with inflation probably worth much less.</div></div><hr />

I always tell them though, and inform them though so they can line up a replacement.  If the rep gets there before i find a group i respectfully bow out and move on.<br />

The game is supposed to be fun.  If it isn't fun for whatever reason ... go elsewhere or log off.  Unless it's a group of my guildmates and/or close friends I have never felt obligated to stay.  Sometimes you just do not want to have to deal with the hassle of a group that isn't complete.  I, for one, have had too many wasted hours waiting for that special somebody (class/friend) to show up.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah ... war cleric monk wiz sk ench is not really a good group  :p  ... then again i was always spoiled.  2 tanks = bad.</div></div><hr />

This group quickly formed up at zone in, then we went off to a camp.  The chanter had lfg up the whole time.  If you join a group and for some reason you do not like it, just politely bow out.  If you are expecting freinds or guildies go come on line soon, they why join a group?   Perhaps the player did not like someone in the group, I do not know.  I do know that nothing in our performance, or time spent forming group gave me any bag signals.  We had not done anything yet. <br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe the group compostion was not ideal to some, but it wa s not a bad group.   <br />
<br />
Yes, this is a game, goal is to have fun.  Being rude =/= Fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/agree<br />
<br />
SK non the less, no need for 2 fd pullers in WoS.   If you had a shaman then all the ench is doing is crack, haste and a 1k nuke with a long recast time.   If the monk and wiz had high dps then ench would only get off 1 or 2 nukes a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 03:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if i get an invite for a zone thats not good xp, i'll go to the group and let them know i'm gonna keep lfg, and when the time comes i look for a rep for a few minutes before moving on.<br />
<br />
it seems rude, but as said earlier, why should i die over and over because one person does a shitty job at their class?  Also if i see someone in the group ive had problems with, i'll leave LFG up and ill announce over /g that i'm looking for x type of group (other zones, camps, targets, whatever). If someone has a problem with this, i just leave. <br />
<br />
i dont think its rude, just set the proper expectations for everyone involved, and let them know your terms when you join the group. i don't really do this much anymore as it shits me when people do it in my groups, but if a group is particularly bad, i'll let them know, and either leave or LFG while looking for a rep. i'm brutally honest though, maybe its not for everybody.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Perfect groups often suck.<br />
I have been doing 4 out of 6 mpg trials successfully so far with a group that usually was with sk/bard/chanter/cleric/cleric and last spot with either pally, ranger or necro.<br />
It still is the players, not the classes that make a good team (90 % of the time at least).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">to my way of thinking, there's a qualitative difference between a guy who agrees to group, shows up with /lfg over his head, then suddenly says &quot;gotta go&quot; and disbands--and someone who tells us he's going to want to do something else pretty soon, and when that opportunity develops he stays long enough for a replacement to be recruited.<br />
The first guy is likely at any second to gimp my experience and that of the rest of the group. He's wasting my time, and he's doing it because he thinks his time is more important than five other peoples' time. <br />
The second guy, though, is just in my group because we're handy to him and he's handy for us, and his offer to stay until the replacement gets here means we're in no way gimped by his l33t offer somewhere else. If it's a pickup group, that's what happens.<br />
I can't tell you how much time I've seen wasted by almost full groups waiting for the perfect class to arrive. half the time the &quot;perfect&quot; class guy turns out not to be able to play very well. Or he says he's coming but 30 minutes later you're still waiting. Or he shows up in 20 minutes with /lfg over his head. Bah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree brabble. It's all about the attitude. I'd rather take some guy who's looking for something more uber for 20 minutes while I find someone who wants to stay, and get xp, then not be doing anything. But he really should say so outright, rather than taking the invite and then putting up lfg because 'this group sucks' and bailing as soon as he gets another invite, leaving us high and dry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tharkun</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have grouped with the original poster.  He is a damn good tank.  I am also a group builder myself and if someone wants something better then I say &quot;Go and get it&quot;  don't waste my time.  <br />
<br />
I don't want the perfect group.  I just want one that can survive and keep going for a while.  Redundancy is fine for me in an xp group because then we can survive the tank leaving. (BTW my main is a wizard.) Basically I think the chanter was an idiot and wouldn't want him in my group.<br />
<br />
just my $0.02<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Axeman1n</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got an invite to a group. I accepted, but asked a question.<br />
Invite was...<br />
<br />
him:&quot;Wanna group in PoV?&quot;<br />
me:&quot;Sure&quot;<br />
me:&quot;Where in PoV&quot;<br />
him:&quot;The Plane of Valor&quot;<br />
me:&quot;Where in the plane of Valor are we camping&quot;<br />
him:&quot;PoK to PoT to Plane of Valor&quot;<br />
me:&quot;NM&quot;<br />
him&quot;You coming?&quot;<br />
me:&quot;no&quot;<br />
<br />
The guy couldn't understand a simple question.<br />
When I get in a group, I stay till I find a replacement, or I just don't group. Being LFG while in group is pretty lame.<br />
With that said, I don't mind if they are willing to find a replacement once grouped.<br />
Whether or not we are a great group, they will get xp in the group. If they get a better offer, then sure, they should leave. But don't say, no thanks to a group, and then sit LFG for the next hour(I have seen this).</div></div><hr />
