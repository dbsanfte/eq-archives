<br />
I'm basically in the same mode, in that Darkblades going to stay till epic 2.0 and that sword from Arch Magus.  Its really a hard gamble since darkblade is still consistant and good aggro at omens end game to be switching it out just for alittle more stats and dps in dual wield combat(I have 2h for that).  So far we havent seen an anger procing weapon in Omens, but I have some speculations that Overlord Mata Muram may have something, he's a warrior-like mob (like Rallos was) so I wouldnt rule out the possibility, but still SOE isnt always consistant.  Our first brutish blade went to a warrior who had no &quot;anger&quot; procing weapon, so i'm not sure if its something other warrior's have thought about or if my guild is just has an odd-bunch of tanks :)</div></div><hr />

ED just entered Qvic like yesterday? I think it's too early for you to worry about that  :D  don't think you will see BBoB any soon. Even we haven't gone back to tavci in ages. Besides Uqua is really gimped now, we finished uqua in 1hr something 2days ago(backflagging ppl for tacvi yes! we finally decided to do tavci again for the first time after oow came out!). <br />
<br />
Since ED could only beat the really gimped Uqua (I was shocked to see only Golem and Barxt to kill to clear), youguys will have some hard times progressing through the rest of the GoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Worrying about graphics of the best mainhand (most peeps with bbob use epic 2.0 offhand, or will use it offhand, hence me saying best mainhand) sword in the game for warriors is retarded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">02-01-2005, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Velle you do remember Uqua was designed for lvl65 with Time/EP armor.<br />
Not 70 With Qvic/Tacvi/CoA. 5 Lvls made it easier, but it still an unforgiving zone.<br />

It's just hard to feel uber carrying around the same sword you see on newbies in ornate armor all the time :).   Could be worse though, the Blade of Carnage used to be the ultimate warrior weapon and it looked like a lam :).</div></div><hr />

Its a nice graphic, just sucks that the GoD endgame weapon looks like a poor man's aggro weapon from a 4+ expansions ago and single groupable content.  Can anyone say BoC 2.0?  (Lamentation graphic etc)<br />
<br />
*edit- how unoriginal of me ... i just noticed Brutul just said the same exact f'in thing.<br />
-3 point for unoriginality i guess  :( <br />

<br />
It actually started like this. I was in PoK one night buyin some invis potions, for what reason I don't know cause they drop right away anyways, and some lvl 37 war comes up to me. Same dye job , yellow &amp; black, claiming I stole his scheme, and the dude was serious.  So i'm like &quot;let's duel for rights then, loser re-dyes.&quot; he replied &quot;You cant take me with GBoS and epic 1.5&quot; I think I pissed my pants over that.  So I told him to meet me in Commonlands to duel, and he ACCEPTED....man was I excited.  So I bullied him around for a bit and killed him, then I started linking him some gear, namely the BBoB he so foolishly called GBoS. Anyways, I was a bastard for that moment in time, and he did change his colors.  It was all a joke to me, but that guy was serious...oh well</div></div><hr />
