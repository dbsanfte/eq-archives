<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have 510 points so far in Everfrost so I'm getting close to the 760 armor, but at 1100 points I could get an anger3 proc. I only really need the legs, but does the anger proc enough to make it worth saving for?<br />
<br />
Also, if you were to go with the proc which weapon would you put it on? My magelo is to the left, and I keep my non-equipped weapons in the box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">for everfrost save for the proc.  or hoard your points towards getting more takish 1.5kpt armour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Omnidream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Best answer.. FFXI :D<br />
<br />
Honest answer however.. anger 3 is your friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hrmmm...the question is:<br />
<br />
Is it worth almost double the cost for 15-25 more hps, 3-5AC and +2 or so in resists per piece between the 760 &amp; 1492 armor?  If you have maxed STA already the decision is hardly clear cut post nerf:<br />
<br />
<br />
Example 1:<br />
Malevolent Breastplate of Suffering: 63ac, 10str, 9dex, 8wis, 7int, 75hp, 75mana, 9fr, 9dr, 9pr, type1, type2, type3<br />
<br />
Royal Attendant Breastplate of the Sand: AC:69, Sta:13, Cha:11, Wis:10, Int:10, HP:100, Mana:100, CR:12, MR:12, PR:12, type2, type2, type3<br />
<br />
deltas (for 732 pts): +6 AC, +13 sta, 25 hps, -9 DEX, -10 STR +3 resists<br />
<br />
Example 2:<br />
Malevolent Bracer of Suffering: 25ac, 3cha, 2wis, 3int, 5agi, 55hp, 55mana, 2fr, 2dr, 2cr, 4pr, type1, type2, type3<br />
<br />
Royal Attendant Bracer of the Sand: AC:28, Str:5, Sta:4, Agi:5, HP:70, Mana:70, DR:3, PR:3, CR:3, MR:5, type1, type2, type3<br />
<br />
Deltas (for 732 pts): +3ac, +5str, +4sta +15hps  <br />
<br />
<br />
Thats alot of extra points for some marginal value (assuming again that STA is not a big lure)<br />
<br />
P.S. I'd go for Anger 3 over anything else, then I'd get a type 3 armor and add a +8pct dodge and then I'd worry about 1492/760 armor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think you should hord your points and unlock all of EF before getting an item.  From my understanding if you spend your points then you will not accumulate anymore for the &quot;faction&quot;.  I could be wrong however, but it's not going to hurt you to save your points up rather than impulse buy.  <br />
<br />
I'd have to also ask what current issues are limiting your character.  Maybe you don;t have great ac/hp, or maybe you have bad aggro problems (well worse than normal aggro issues).  I can;t tell just from looking up your magelo what you need.  For example:  In the group i adventure with, I never have aggro issues although I occationally die when a pull goes bad and I have 8 mobs on me.  I use a GSoT with a wimpy proc thrown in it (50pt dd) just for fun, but my armor is mostly thurg quest and a few others.  I could really use armor upgrades as my aggro generation is fine (well again as compared to other warriors that is).  I am saving the points for armor, but that's just me.  <br />
<br />
I also am going to get the yesheka proc instead of anger3 and try that out first.  On a weapon such as the GSoT (which doesn;t have aggro problems anyhow) the yeskeka proc will boost the DPS and add a little extra aggro, where as anger just adds aggro.  Once my GSoT proc's once as is the mob is mine, so i am not real motivated to get the anger3 augment.  I do have some 1hs that could really use anger3 proc though, but I've sworn off 1hs because of insane ripostles/damage sheilds/ and enrage, but again that is just me.  I am sure someone else thinks 2hs/2hb is a waste and anger3 is a must . . . but it just isn;t from my perspective.  Look at what you got/need and go from there is what I say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>radalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">anger3&gt;yak<br />
<br />
by quite a bit in my experience.  Personally theres no such thing as enough agro.  The more agro you have, the more your group can contribute without fear of ping-ponging.<br />
<br />
And from what I know the points do work like faction.  You can spend your points at any time and still unlock armor as long as you have the &quot;total earned points&quot; high enough.<br />
<br />
personally working on the Mir legs and Tak BP myself.  Its not just the stamina, but also the charisma stats that makes the BP worth it imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bah anger3 &gt; yak is highly speculative at best.  Bottom line assess your own strengths and weaknesses and go from there.  There is no simple easy pat answer on what you should get.  That said I am working on the BP from Tak (1200points there atm), though i'll probably wind up getting more peices from EF simply because it's not near as expensive; imho Mir &gt; Tak simply because of cost . . . imagine what you would do with the other 5124points left over from a set of EF gear (7 pieces) vs Tak.  I don;t remember (maybe someone else know's) if the weapon augs were lore so you could only have 1 weapon with anger3 etc.  but that is something to consider.  I would also advise you save the point and get anger3 rather than anger2 while you are at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Tharak obviously subsribes to the quality in quantity theory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well I guess if you were wearing thurg quest armor still then you'd probably see why i say that ;-)<br />
<br />
Just for debate the tak vs mir armor breaks down like this:<br />
<br />
For a complete set (BP, legs, arm, bracerx2, helm, gauntlet, feet)<br />
<br />
Tak is 29ac, 14str, 23sta, 16agil, 4wis, 4int, 130hp, 6mr, 11dr, 15pr, 9cr, 5fr better than the set at mir. for 11936 points, and no aug  <br />
<br />
Mir is 23dex, 2cha better that Tak. for 6080 points, and no aug<br />
<br />
so ask yourself how much is the extra worth and is it worth the extra 115 adventures (at 51points per adventure) ?  <br />
<br />
In this case i am not 100% sure the &quot;quality&quot; of the tak armor makes up for the expense vs Mir armor.  Besides most likely i'll mix and match to get what i want anyhow, and screw the matching set.  <br />
<br />
um back to the original post . . . save your points and get what bothers you most.  You have aggro prob;s get anger3, you getting hit to hard by mobs (or don;t have the hitpoints) get some armor . . . your call.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">130hp,  29 ac, and those saves and others, make it seem like takish is a whole item and then a little better then miraguls.    <br />
<br />
What you need to really look at is, what items you can upgrade through raiding easily and the ones you won't replace in near future get a quality takish piece for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">In this case i am not 100% sure the &quot;quality&quot; of the tak armor makes up for the expense vs Mir armor.

<br />
Bingo you get it.  The Nerf REALLY impacted this decision.<br />
<br />
What you need to really look at is, what items you can upgrade through raiding easily and the ones you won't replace in near future get a quality takish piece for. <br />
<br />
If you are raid retired for the foreseeable future then this schews your perspective as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There are a couple things you need to consider when purchasing LDoN vendor items, and your current situation will impact these differently.<br />
<br />
1. When considering armor purchases, you need to compare each item individually, because as Flair pointed out, there is a substancial difference in cost compared to the amount of upgrade when comparing Tak and EF armors. Like all other armor sets, you need to determine which pieces suit you the best for the poists cost.<br />
<br />
2. When considering any augment, you have to take into account that you will lose the augment when you upgrade the item you upgrade. If you have some cultural armor but you are in a VT or elem+ raiding guild, it's not really a good idea to put +40hp on those items beacuse it is very likely you will get a better item in the near future anyway. Same goes with weapons augments. If you don't stand a chance at getting better than CHoS and SotB then put Anger/Yak on them. If your guild is killing AoW or BoT towers or at least near there, then you probably want to wait until you can get a BoC or a GBoS before buying an augment.<br />
<br />
Basically you want to spend your points where they will last the longest because once they are spent, you can never get them back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The only things that really interested me with LDoN were the +40hp aug, +10ac aug, and AngerIII procs.<br />
<br />
The +40hp and +10ac augs can still be applied to Type7, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thanks for the replies. <br />
<br />
I think I'll probably hold out for the anger3 proc instead of buying the leggings, though the legs would be a noticable improvement over my Thurg ones. <br />
<br />
The only thing that makes me hesitate with the proc is which weapon to apply it to. I don't really have any single weapon that I don't see upgrading eventually. Maybe I'll look around in the bazaar to find a good ratio and stat weapon without  a proc. It should come cheaper than one with a built-in proc and would be really nice once the hate was added.<br />
<br />
Also, do I need to spend the 1492 points on one item to unlock all the dungeon gear, or can I save up 1492 and buy 2 cheaper items? I'm sure this has been explained elsewhere, but I thought since we're on the subject and all, I might as well ask here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you are raid retired for the foreseeable future then this skews(sp?) your perspective as well.<br />
<br />
True enough, but if i was raiding vex plus i don;t think i would waste my time on any LDoN armor now that it has been nerfed anyhow.  I guess I was answering the post assuming that either raids were not available or he was hording up his DKP points for something else.  Don;t get me wrong the LDoN armor is nice, but if you are in a raiding type guild in SSRA+ i don;t even think i would bother with it.  Your aggro proc of choice would be points better spent.  <br />
<br />
Like Wander said once your points are spent they are spent.  Looking at your magelo, you have a solid weapon combo, more aggro would help but you are certainly not hurting.  Your Ac/Hp's are not hurting either, but the legs suck in comparison to the rest of your armor.  The CHoS and the sword will prob not be around for the long haul depending on what targets you are hitting, and what you are hitting in PoP.  I'd personally go for the legs because unless you are farming some good armor spots you won;t be upgrading anytime soon.  Then again if you are in SSRA+ your weapons will also be changing and it might serve you better to collect points till you get something nice to augment . . . or just get a cheap augment to enhance what you got (understanding those points are now gone forever).  You could get the legs for 760, anger3 for 1150 (though that's a bunch a points to &quot;waste&quot;), or get a cheap yak proc (is the lowest 510 or 760?).  I would much rather augment bloodfrenzy or some other higher end weapon with anger3 than slap that many points into a CHoS.  That is not to say a CHoS is not good but we are comparing apples and oranges.  What are you raiding and what do you hope to get in the near future and plan accordingly.  <br />
<br />
That said I still think the whole anger3 &gt; yak is a pointless argument.  You can't parse the hate change.  From my experience though, Palies are getting massive aggro lock from resisted stun . . . yak = resisted stun.  Maybe the aggro is better from anger3 but who can tell  . . .  heck pep's in the overlord forum are still debating it . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>radalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It was debatable when anger3 was 300hate.<br />
<br />
true you cant tell how much agro a single stun will give, but in my experience,<br />
<br />
600hate&gt;single stun+dd everytime.  <br />
<br />
yes, this is my experience, but I think most will agree with this statement.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure this has been explained elsewhere, but I thought since we're on the subject and all, I might as well ask here.  There are actually 2 pools of points you are working with.<br />
<br />
1. &quot;Faction&quot; points - the number of points you have earned in a particular theme determines how many of the items you can see in that theme. You have to have 1492 Tak points to see 1492 Tak items. Once you have unlocked a level of items in one theme, you will always be able to see them no matter how many Total points you have.<br />
<br />
2. Total points - once you unlock an item, when you buy it, it comes out of the TOTAL amount of points you have earned across all adventures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It was debatable when anger3 was 300hate.<br />

<br />
It might be true, but dang it there has to be a reason a stupid paly stun spell that is resisted is getting so much aggro right.  I guess it's my nature too, i don;t trust SoE to keep the anger3 hate at 600.  It's only a matter of time before they stealth nerf us again.  Besides if you are planning on upgrading your weapons at all then yak&gt;anger3 becuase it's a whole lot less points you'll have to grind out to augment each new weapon you get.  All i know is i would be really pissed after spending 1150 points on anger3 to have it either 1) work better but hard to tell how much better 2) work better and then wake up one morning where anger3 = 300 points (again).  Besides you gotta give the thumbs up for the cool skull graphics ;-)  <br />
<br />
I still think it's highly subjective what really works better, then again I currently have more Guk points than Mir so that would tend to sway my opinion.  I do know that 600hate or stun+dd &gt; not having a second aggro proc.  As to what is better . . . . <br />
<br />
SoE will probably &quot;balance&quot; warriors by adding a 1492 point angerV type4 augment after i spend my points so i can yank out what is left of my hair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">&quot;I think you should hord your points and unlock all of EF before getting an item.

<br />
That's not how it works.<br />
<br />
I spent 300 or so points in mistmoore. They came from my TOTAL points pool. In my &quot;Points Earned pool&quot; it still lists how many points (or faction) I've earned at Mistmoore altogether. And when I got more mistmoore adventures, the faction went up from where it was.<br />
<br />
Think of it as two seaparate things.<br />
<br />
You earn your FACTION in each camp and that stays static, only going up as you accumulate more faction.<br />
<br />
You also earn POINTS to spend on items and stuff. And they obviously fluctuate a lot.<br />
<br />
I don't know if I'm explaining it any good at all. So I apoligize if all I'm doing is continuing to confuse. It's a LOT easier to see it work in game  yourself by clicking on the adventure merchants and stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>radalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">yea.. thats what Im kinda afraid of also.... Sony nerfing anger3 back to 300 or something similar.  I would hope they would give out a refund for the points if something like that happened...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>kaledan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">i don;t trust SoE to keep the anger3 hate at 600. It's only a matter of time before they stealth nerf us again. <br />
<br />
<br />
A nerf of stun so it doesn't give any hate on stun-immune mobs is probably more likely.<br />
<br />
soru</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Warram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Get the legs. That is a massive upgrade. I'm also of the school of thought that the tak plate is too expensive for such a minor upgrade, especially since (I'm pretty sure they did this) they made the aug slots the same as the miragul's armor. Buy the greaves and then the anger proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Nerf the hybrid's?  You have got to be kidding me . . . . that will happen ROFL!!!<br />
<br />
I highly doubt they will nerf stun aggro.  It would make items with Planar stun totally worthless (you know it's a 0.0 sec stun right).  <br />
<br />
It is much more likly that SoE will see that being able to add 600hate to a weapon for a mere 1150 points is not what they intended.  Notice that prior to LDoN to get a weapon with 600 hate proc you needed to be raiding SSRA plus content or AoW (well maybe i am missing a few weapons).  Now you can basically take your favorite weapon and add that to it for 23 adventures (normal) worth of work.  You know somebody is going to complain . . . but eh we'll see . . . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Small update:<br />
<br />
I spent my first 760 points on the leggings since I'm finding it hard to get EF groups lately, and this was an immediate improvement while I work towards more points.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now I know how the points work since I finally spent some. <br />
<br />
Basically, once you buy an item, like my 760 armor, you can use the points from any dungeon to buy things in Everfrost up to 760 points. I currently have 860 points from wins in EF, but only 550 points total unspent. I need 4 more wins in EF and then just points from anywhere to make up the remainder of the 1150 to buy my hate aug. <br />
<br />
I also saw a nice 15/20 hammer for 1150 points. If I were to add AngerIII to it I would have very close to a BoC, unfortunately LDoN is getting boring fast. I just don't like the rush, rush, rush factor. I like dungeon crawls, not dungeon dashes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gnomos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Well, I slapped A3 on my BF and boc, and now wizards complain that they can't nuke mobs off of me.  Kind of a nice change :).<br />
<br />
As for 760 vs 1492 armor, I agree that the nerf majorly sucked, esp changing one slot from T2 to T1.  However, you can only wear one piece of gear in a slot at any one time, so I believe you should save up and get the best that you can.</div></div><hr />
