<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EgatBearskinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night my guild downed the Rathe Council and we will be dedicated to raiding Time almost exclusively within the next couple of weeks.  My problem is this, due to an extended AFK last fall I am far behind the rest of the warriors in my guild, so bad in fact that I rarely MA against anything.  I have only managed to get one piece of Raex so far.  I have heard that elemental leg molds drop fairly regularly in Time, but I am concerned about what to do with the rest of my armor slots.  I'll be surfing around Lucy and Allakazam's over the next few days to check my options and make up my mind but am hoping some of you guys here who have done this before may have some suggestions about what I should aim my DKP at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well you will find upgrades to Raex for pretty much every slot in Time.  Of course with the rest of your guild getting upgrades as well, it will be slow going, but perhaps you can pick up elemental molds cheap now that the rest of your guild will be focusing on time loot.</div></div><hr />

go to GoD and do trial 5. there are a pair of nice legs that drop there, might be trial 6 i don't remember. also most of the other trials pre KT has some nice stuff for you. do some hardcore LDoN for the slots you can't get out of time P1 (earring, ring and neck are from p1). or you could just do hardcore LDoN for the hp augs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brudal the Fat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not sure how your guild will end up handling it but you quickly see phase1 and 2 loot rot. I know you hear people say that about elemental mobs to but in time it becomes true quickly. <br />
<br />
So, with that in mind I can think of several upgrades for you in phase 1 that will most likely not be competed for, even for new people to time if they farmed the elementals for a while.<br />
<br />
Ring of Force<br />
Pulsing Emerald Hoop<br />
Smooth Onyx Torque<br />
<br />
Phase 2 loot you can look at Girdle of Restoration, Cudgle of Wrecking(assuming you dont have a decent 1h dps weapon). Gauntlets of Distraction.<br />
<br />
All the upgrades I listed are not real upgrades to elemental armor so competition should be low for you. Normally I wouldn't recommend settling for these drops but in your situation of playing catch up I think its the best route for ya. Otherwise you can bank and save DKP till you can get items you would truely want (read: phase 4 thru Quarm). Depending on your guilds agressivness that could take a month or 5 months, so you have to make the call of what helps the guild the most in the longrun not what makes your magelo look phat. Having HP and AC that can be of use to your guild means more than staying in the top 20 rankings imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Drool a little, plan a lot. Like someone else already mentioned, you should be able to pick up a lot of good upgrades from the lower tiers. If your guild heavily farmed elems and mst people are already in mostly elem armor, then competition for tier 1-3 items will be pretty low. You can get a Time item for every slot so gearing up should be easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">like brudal said, these 3 items will be pretty good upgrades and should go for very low dkp (there are 5 dropds every night in phase1, out of a loottable of 5 items) Depending on the equipment level of your guild you even might get Armguards of the Brute from TT or Helm of flowing Time from TZ kinda cheap. Most ppl dont bag ele armor + 40hp augs for a 20hp upgrade.  Otherwise just take cheap elemental armor, it will last you pretty long (im at 11700hp atm and still wear all ele armor parts, the first one i would bag would be a bracer, replaced by quarm bracer) Oh and you might grab a VDD if your knights prefer hopebringer / gboc, guessing your MTs go for dbtow.  And finally: yes, elemental legs are VERY common n phase3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">elemental legs are VERY common n phase3.<br />
<br />
If you find plate legs to be the exception to this rule, as I have, you can always get legs from Vxed as someone mentioned above.<br />
