<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only buffs are VQ and Pestilence Shock.  Each parse is 5 mins against the same Katta Banker. 305 str, 282 dex, 1461 atk.  These parses vary from my old parses in that I now have Ferocity3 and CF1.  With max offensive AA, I could add approx 10 DPS to all of the totals.  Also of note is no ambidex, and only PB1.  41% worn haste, SBoS.<br />
<br />
Cudgel and SoPP have 50 lifetap proc augment.  EoE and DBotW have no proc augs, and will only have anger3 in the future, so no increase to DPS.  VDD has 100 ykesha augment.<br />
<br />
It should also be noted that apparently Katta Bankers now riposte/parry/dodge from the back.... so even though I was behind the mob, it was still defending against me... so strikethru and stuff was firing and the DPS is more accurate for a warrior fighting from the front.<br />
<br />
Cudgel/SoPP: 147.5 DPS, 6.5 Proc DPS<br />
<br />
Ugh, VQ dropped already.  So only buff is Pestilence Shock now.<br />
<br />
<br />
DBotW/SoPP #2: 128 DPS, 7 Proc DPS.<br />
DBotW/Cudgel: 125.5 DPS, 10 Proc DPS.<br />
DBotW/SoPP: 121 DPS, 7.5 Proc DPS.<br />
VDD: 119 DPS, 9 Proc DPS.<br />
VDD: 117 DPS, 9 Proc DPS.<br />
DBotw/EoE #2: 113 DPS, 9.5 Proc DPS.<br />
SoPP/Cudgel: 113 DPS, 6 Proc DPS.<br />
EoE/Cudgel: 111 DPS, 8 Proc DPS.<br />
DBotW/Cudgel #2: 110.5 DPS, 10.5 Proc DPS.<br />
DBotw/EoE: 110 DPS, 9.5 Proc DPS.<br />
Cudgel/SoPP: 107 DPS, 8 Proc DPS.<br />
Cudgel/EoE: 104.5 DPS, 9 Proc DPS.<br />
<br />
I guess that I should get Ambidex soon, I think that would likely boost the faster weapons offhand over the slower SoPP.<br />
<br />
Running an 8 hour or so parse now to figure out proc rate on Cudgel/SoPP.</div></div><hr />

Unbuffed.<br />
<br />
Cudgel of Wrecking / Sword of Primordial Power:<br />
<br />
DPS: 104.7<br />
Proc DPS: 5<br />
Hit %: 67.6<br />
Hits per second: 1.85 <br />
Critical hits: 1809<br />
Crit hits PM: 2.75<br />
Critical blasts: 91<br />
Crit blasts PM: 0.14<br />
Rune Procs:  698<br />
Runes PM: 1.06<br />
Healing PM: 84.8 hps<br />
Rune absorbsion PM: 106 damage<br />
50 Lifetap Procs: 1863<br />
50 Lifetap Procs PM: 2.83<br />
Healing PM: 141.5 hps<br />
75 Lifetap Procs: 1279<br />
75 Lifetap Procs PM: 1.94<br />
Healing PM: 145.5 hps<br />
<br />
Total Healing PM: 371.8 hps<br />
Total Healing Per Second: 6.2 DPS<br />
Total Healing and Damage Absorbed PM: 477.8 hps<br />
<br />
Total damage avoided per second: 7.96 DPS<br />
<br />
Assuming regen of 60 per tick, healing per second: 10 DPS<br />
<br />
So regen + lifetaps + runes = 17.96 DPS healed/avoided, not counting critical procs.<br />
<br />
So I can indefinently solo anything that does under 18 DPS... and anything above that means downtime... you can assume there is some time needed to pull mobs and bring them to a safe spot etc.  So something as high as maybe 25-30 DPS could be fought 'non-stop' or 'as fast as possible'.<br />
<br />
Also to note is that the proc rates for each of these weapons is 'normal' ie: 2 PPM main hand, 1 PPM offhand.  Where as something like DBotW/BF/etc are something like 3+ PPM mainhand.<br />
<br />
Going to parse some PoN mobs that I generally solo and see what their DPS is...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unslowed PoN mobs:<br />
<br />
virulent arachnid: 58 DPS<br />
virulent arachnid: 40 DPS<br />
gnarled treant: 47 DPS<br />
gnarled treant: 56 DPS<br />
<br />
Willsapper slowed PoN mobs:<br />
<br />
virulent arachnid: 46 DPS<br />
blood raven: 42 DPS<br />
blood raven: 39 DPS<br />
gnarled treant: 35 DPS<br />
gnarled treant: 32 DPS<br />
<br />
So assuming slow lands fairly quickly, I'm still looking at 30-45 DPS - 18 DPS, so I've got about 12-27 DPS to recover in downtime.<br />
<br />
With a bunch of AA points, I could get 0.5 DPS more regen.  I have 12 worn regen, plus 15 from Fungi Vest, so 27, max worn regen is 35.  So I could gain another 8 worn regen, so 1.3 DPS.<br />
<br />
So equip + AA could net me another 2 or so DPS regen.  Thus around 20 DPS healing/rune/regen etc.  Which still leaves 10-25 ish DPS to regen in downtime from PoN mobs.<br />
<br />
I guess helpful, but still not an overly impressive amount of healing/regen for either soloing (for quality exp) or raiding.  Though I guess if you could hit 40ish DPS regen/rune/healing, you would be pretty 'overpowered'.... shrug.</div></div><hr />

And that's not the real hp/tick they intend - it'll be more.  It's fairly fast refresh right now too.  If it stays that way it'll be a very nice bump for those of us who enjoy the occasional solo gig.</div></div><hr />
