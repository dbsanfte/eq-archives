Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rugal Bloodwind</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its not really a trick, just how isle 5 works with interlinked spawns. So, yea..like Roma said. Don't touch the guardian and lord will insta repop every time.<br />
If he aggros during clearing, don't worry. He will respawn as long as at least one lesser spiroc is alive and non aggro.<br />
I did it a few weeks ago, killed several lords. It works, its just a zone that is massively irritating (at least to me:eek:).</div></div><hr />

And yes the Spiroc Wingblade is multi questable.<br />
Have the person hand in the blade first then the Warrior hands in the Note To Kargek or whatever his name is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grocolo</div><div class="date">04-20-2003, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We did this last night on the Lanys server.  The lord was cheap as ass though, got 3 Wingblades and killed him at least 20 times.  We only took 3 groups, never actually had 18 people at any single time, and got to the 5th island pretty fast.  Plane of Sky is definately not the brickwall it once was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roma</div><div class="date">04-20-2003, 08:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We also did PoSky last night :) We had a few issues getting the last Vanquisher away from the Lord.... Once it was just Lord + Guard, I threw myself on the Lord 9 of the 11 times we killed him and got 4 blades (woohoo!!!) It took maybe 2-3 hours on that island and we had 24 people. It was a rush to finall make it to Island 7 after 12 1/2 hours of farming/clearing, then jumping off and landing on a chain :X</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I hate PoSky. DT'ing mobs get really old really fast. It's just a pain in the ass zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Assuming a raid force of about 20 average level 60, how long will it take to clear to him?<br />
<br />
On my server someone has a  bridge maintained to the 7th island. Is it worth using the bridge and work down to him orjust clear to 5th island from first?</div></div><hr />

<br />
:D :D :D :D  Haha.. reminds me of one raid ages ago. We spent the day farming and clearing decided to do the mass jump. (Jumping from the Isle drops you in Freeport docks out in the middle of the water) Some poor SK jumped, zoned into freeport and fell to his death on the moving boat!! Talk about timing, really! LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tarsk</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 07:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last time we jumped off, we all got stuck on top of each other in mid-air. Wizard had to do that AoE mass TL to bind thingy to get us all out</div></div><hr />

good info guys im to this part myself :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blacktalun</div><div class="date">04-27-2003, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I be the one that told Klopo that it didn't seem to work anymore.  THe last time I went there (CT Sever) we had the guard and Lord up.  Killed the Lord and he never respawned again.  We all camped thinking that maybe possibly someone had agro on the Guardian.  Still now spawn.  Since then I have found out that it was working correctly again.  of course at first we thought that it might have been &quot;fixed&quot; but future excursions seem to have proved otherwise.  Apparently it was just a one time bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sikkorak</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have done this 2 times personally.<br />
<br />
First time we did this was last year, a couple months before PoP came out.  The biggest pain clearing the island except for the guardian and Lord was Guardian has low aggro range (like all of them) but HUGE assist range.  We had to off tank him while everyone camped out. Had 17 people.<br />
<br />
Most recently we did it and it was alot easier, nm the levels of course.<br />
Before your first pull on the island, get someone to pacify the Guardian.  First pull, we got 2 vanquishers and their associated lessers, 2nd pull, last vanquisher and associated.  Easy.<br />
<br />
Only issue we had is after death of Lord, Sirran pops on his place.  So you either need to move Sirrran, or move to a different pull spot.  We moved sirran, just get someone, monk works, to hit him from max range, and run like hell.  Contrary to first time, I guess we were killing fast enough, Sirran only repopped on death spot 1 out of 2 times.<br />
<br />
And yes, be prepared for DT's.  One sacrifice on pull, then the first MT will go down about 30s into fight (depending on length of pull from his spawn, 45s between DT's).  Should easily be able to kill him in under 90s.<br />
22 DT's in one day is enough for me :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klopo</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 01:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, we went up to air and did the whole spiroc lord farming session.  It was pretty successful, bagging at least 5 wingblades for the warriros there.  What we did to avoid Sirran was to wait until he started to move away and then have someone hail him so he wouldn't move.  while the hailer was doing his thing, we moved the rest of the people out of Sirran's assist range and were able to farm the lord without any fear of having Sirran add.</div></div><hr />
