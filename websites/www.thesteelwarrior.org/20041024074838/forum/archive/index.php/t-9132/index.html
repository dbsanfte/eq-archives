<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>carlador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">for the part in Vexd does the warrior doing this part need the trial flag to get in or do we get a temp flag to do this part?</div></div><hr />

If your doing it for your epic, just be sure that your the one who gets it otherwise you won't get the special instance that has your epic mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GraniteMG</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">&quot;Anyone can get a Vxed expedition at any time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Was this changed? You use to need sewers 1-4 as far as I knew.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think the question was misunderstood. As far as I know, you will still require having completed all sewer trials to be able to start your vxed instance. I do not believe Sony has created an &quot;alternate&quot; flag if you will, to open up a vxed instance if you are merely up to that point in your epic progression. And yes, you must be the one to start the instance.<br />
<br />
Having said that, if you are capable of doing the epic quest, sewers 1-4 should be easy peasy for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maztheslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I haven't even been to the sewers and I do VXed all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Maz, the key here is that the Warrior doing the epic needs to request the Vxed expedition. Sure you probably have been to Vxed before, but you didn't start the expo right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't have sewers or rondo completed and have started both tipt and vxed multiple times, and got the vxed flag last weekend.  Therefore, anyone who is ready to tackle the vxed part of th epic quest should be able to spawn vxed and complete the quest. Where is this misinformation coming from? just go hail the apprentice and say &quot;vxed&quot; and you get an event even if it's your first time in any GoD zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>GraniteMG</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Misinformation came from common knowledge of GoD progression since it's release. I can vouch for the fact that about 2 months before omens if you didn't have sewers 1-4 you couldn't start a vxed or tipt expedition. Atleast I couldn't until after I got my sewers 1-4.<br />
<br />
Sounds like it may have changed since then, as I understood it before progression was like this to KT:<br />
<br />
Sewers 1-4 in order (not that they had to be done in order, but if you try to get a sewers expedition, you'd always get the first uncompleted one, if you beat 2, you'd get 1 the next time, etc)<br />
Vxed or Tipt (needed all 4 sewers to get an expedition)<br />
Kod'taz (Had to have Vxed and Tipt done.)<br />
<br />
Am/was I wrong in all this? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yea, that's news to me too. Originally you couldn't spawn a vxed instance without having done sewers 1-4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Anyone can get a Vxed expedition at any time.<br />

If your doing it for your epic, just be sure that your the one who gets it otherwise you won't get the special instance that has your epic mobs.Not the case at all. I did the expedition Saturday and Sunday night for back flagging and my epic. Both times I did not get the expedition, nor was I expedition leader. Both times it had the extra spawns for the warrior epic encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Not the case at all. I did the expedition Saturday and Sunday night for back flagging and my epic.

Interesting. I hadn't noticed them, but wasn't looking very hard. Maybe it just triggers if you have a warrior at the right stage in the epic quest progression in the group when you trigger the zone?<br />
<br />
I've been able to spawn tipt/vxed ever since the defensive nerf, so if it wasn't possible before then, I'm guessing thats when the change went in. Incidentally, to my knowledge you have always been able to spawn any sewer trial (but not get a flag) by talking to gamesh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jyynnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You don't have to be the person who &quot;spawns&quot; the vxed encounter.. if you are flagged in the epic qust, you will spawn the borer's by zoning in, but you must be at that stage in the epic quest before they will pop. I had a rogue start my vxed expedition, and once I zoned in, the Borer's popped.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how it works if you do not have smith/sewers done as far as getting in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same with me.  <br />
<br />
Created the vxed instance with my warrior, got all the borer spawns, killed them all, got the ink, alt-Z'd, then the necro in my group got another instance to get some xp for a few mins before he had to log.  Hello borer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not really a big deal I guess, but from now on I just need to remember mini borer dude is always gonna be there at the entrance and bum rush me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Untrue. I triggered it went in after first bore enc had emergency had to log. We left next day went back someone else (pally) triggered but mobs were up again. Got all 3 and boss</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fulcrum Corvyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yeah I was invited to a group in Vxed already and when I zoned in they all were like WTF where that come from LOL<br />
<br />
Anyhow, maybe this has been said, but you can pull all 4 to zone in.  Very nice! Wish I would have known that 4 hours prior LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Oxbolix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">How exactly do you pull them all to the zoneline?<br />
<br />
First is easy, and the second is easy to tag if you hook around the long way.<br />
<br />
I spent like 12 hours in vxed attempting to get mine, got the chanter his epic piece but while medding up to take the borer our monk managed to get to close and brought it in while people were medding.  We wiped at 5% unfortunatly but if there was a way to pull to the zoneline it would save a number of hours :)<br />
<br />
The only way I can think it would work would be for a monk to flip/flop his way there and drag them back one at a time.  This only works if the Borelings/Borer doesnt path back.   Spose it could be done I guess.  Any tips or hints appreiciated.<br />
<br />
Vxed xp is damn nice but I want a short cut :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jyynnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My husband is a monk, and he has pulled for a few warriors now. They don't reset when he feigns, so he can single pull them all the way down including the Borer. He goes up invis, flops if he has to, then races down with everything on him..  we have camp before the patio around the corner. once he gets by patio, he fd's everything off him and the borer stays there for a tag</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Oxbolix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Thanks alot :)  Worked a treat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Durt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Using a bard is the fastest way to do the pull to zone in. Can be done in 10 minutes or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Starfire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">How would i pull all 4 to zone in without trains?, pacc up to them is way to difficult</div></div><hr />
