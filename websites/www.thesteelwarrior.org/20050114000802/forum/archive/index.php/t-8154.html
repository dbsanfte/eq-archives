sell both your weapons and buy the droga combo ... your weapons are shit for warriors.  Good dps, yes, but awful for aggro (which is your job).  Go buy a GSoT and slap the anger3 on it or buy the droga combo and toss anger3 on one of the two.<br />
<br />
Whatever you do ... get rid of those weapons.</div></div><hr />

The fact that you got an anger 3 aug implies you intend to tank, and for that purpose those weapons are horrible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Any&quot; is relative ofcourse, I don't recommend dumping a velium gemmed longsword and putting your anger 3 aug in a SSoY, though it probably wouldnt be the stupidist thing you could (the stupidest thing you could do being to put A3 augs into a DPS combo).</div></div><hr />

Droga weapons are the cheapest decent purchasable aggro setup. Weapons that don't start with some sort of aggro setup are DPS only, and you should NOT augment them with aggro procs. Anger 3 on a VGLS or SBoD is simply a waste of an augment. You will get much more aggro out of putting the same augments onto the Droga setup.</div></div><hr />

For a warrior BoC and a fist is better then what you currently have. Grab a BoC and Anger3 it then get a copper hammer for your offhand. If you can get your hands on a bloodfrenzy or Hategiver that would be even better then the copper hammer. If you Anger3 the BoC and then get a Bloodfrenzy leave the BoC in primary until you can Anger3 the Bloodfrenzy.<br />

Warriors do NOT deal in DPS, they don't care about DPS, all they care about is being able to keep the mob mad enough at them that the DPS can kill it without getting hit. High agro procs &gt; all.</div></div><hr />

May I ask why a Anger 3 aug on a Velium Gem long sword is bad? I havent tanked for a while been gone from EQ. Seems to me a Weapon witha proce already bult in like a copper hammer, would proc the additional hate aug less. Someone explain how a sword wsith anger 3 only is less useful then a copper hammer for instance with a stacked proc? Im confused</div></div><hr />

<br />
The basic reasoning is a warrior can never have too much agro.<br />
<br />
Therefore, in dual wielding setups, 2 weapon with 2 agro procs should produce the maximum amount of agro possible.  The recommended route is 2 weapons with built-in Enraging Blow type procs (if not a built-in hate proc, use a built-in stun proc) with Anger 3's (or an Anger 3 + Ykesha augment).<br />
<br />
Not only does having two procs on each weapon increase your potential agro (a good thing), it increases the chance of procing sooner in a fight, allowing slows, etc. to land sooner without stealing agro.  As the knights have shown, this is good for xp...and of course, on raids, it's equally as good.<br />
<br />
Mathematically (please realize this is simplified and is not 100% accurate for EQ)<br />
<br />
2 weapons x (450 hate proc built-in each, stun only) = 900 hate<br />
2 weapon augments of 600 Hate each (anger 3) = 1200 hate<br />
Total agro potential 2100.<br />
<br />
2 weapons x (0 hate proc built-in each) = 0 hate<br />
2 weapon augments of 600 Hate each (anger 3) = 1200 hate<br />
Total agro potential 1200.<br />
<br />
Once again, this is overly simplified and I'm very sure some more experienced EQ veterans would rip this formula to shreds if I didn't repeat that this is not an accurate formula, this doesn't account for procs per minute, nor does it account for the agro potential difference between main hand and off hand...nor does it address dps agro, which is generally not large enough to make up the difference in potential agro...just to mention a few holes in it.  However, it's easy to see with this that 2100 is almost twice the agro as good as 1200.<br />
<br />
If I recall, 1 point of hate is supposed to be equal to 1 point of melee damage.  Therefore, if your weapon was 100 / 20 or so, but no proc, you 'might' be better off augmenting that weapon...but you won't be able to spike your hate with a quick 400 - 600ish agro proc.<br />
<br />
That being said, if you want to be different, if you can hold agro with current setup without any problems, feel free to augment any weapon you want, you just have to realize you won't have the highest possible agro you could have...and unless you are signficantly better geared and AA'd than your casters or hybrids, they are managing their agro at your level rather than their mana (per fight).<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Reread your question.  AFAIK a weapon with two procs will not proc less often than a weapon with 1 proc.  I know it definitely increases the odds of having  any proc happen sooner.  I believe (but no evidence to support) that a weapon can have both procs go off at the same time (or same round).  I apologize if my original response was unhelpful.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because its a DPS weapon with a single aggro proc.<br />
Crap aggro.<br />
Crap aggro is bad<br />
<br />
I shouldnt put an anger aug in my sbod? <br />
<br />
Correct.<br />
Fast weapons, ratios, DPS do not make up for the aggro of a double procing stun or hate weapon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lathen</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems to me a Weapon witha proce already bult in like a copper hammer, would proc the additional hate aug less.<br />
<br />
The innate proc and the augmented proc on a weapon fire at the same rate. They are subject to your dex and the slot you have equipped the weapon. So, if you have max dex, each proc on your mainhand weapon will go off 3x per minute. Repeat, BOTH procs will go off 3x a minute.<br />
<br />
So -- you're MUCH better for aggro purposes to follow the advice in this thread; namely, anger augment a weapon that ALREADY has an aggro proc. The two easiest weapons to acquire that fit that description are the Copper Hammer and the Sword of the Bloodsworn.<br />
<br />
PS -- the info about dex and proc-ing can be found in the library, I believe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
wrong, the second proc doent proc as often as the first, since you cant proc both on the same swing. but the loss is very small.<br />
<br />
So, if you have max dex, each proc on your mainhand weapon will go off 3x per minute.<br />
<br />
nope, the normal proc rate at max dex is 2ppm main hand. so the aug's proc rate would be like 1.98 or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reasons why im questioning the advice is simple. A: I am an old school tank I left when velious came out so Im out of the loop. B: I have played since day one which is long enough to want to understand the reasons behind something. Otherwise I end up asking repeatedly and look like a damn noob. So FurryCrew..<br />
<br />
I asked for advice not sarcasm, if you wanna be an ass go to a paladin board here we actually help one another. K , thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The difference will be very, very slight.<br />
<br />
If you have a delay 20 weapon, 100% haste, and no AA's, then:<br />
<br />
Chance of proccing the weapon's proc = 1.667% per swing<br />
Chance of proccing the augment's proc = 1.639% per swing</div></div><hr />
