<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Guy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I'm in a raiding guild who is currently about to crack into the EP's (had RZ to friggin 0% and walking away and out last member got smacked by adds). Anyways, we are warrior heavy, most of them having more DKP than I currently have (due to hiatus).  Anyways, there is little to no chance of me acquiring a BoW or similar in the near future. I'll be able to make upgrades through ornate/OoW gear on armor at least in the near future. What weapons/gear should I be on the lookout for that isn't usually heavily bid on? I was thinking valiant belt of fallen heroes from mith marr (we'll have to backflag people) and perhaps a rotting fist (also need to get people Bert again). Any suggestions are welcome, but my weapons are my main concern at this point in time.<br />

oh, and I know this is all subject to receiving drops, etc. :))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">aug those with anger 3 and you should be fine.  upgrade weaps if you want, but droga with anger 3 is a good combo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Save all your points for EP loot.<br />

Raex gear and a SEWS is your best bet for efficiency.  Lots of warriors will hold out for a BoWar .. but this puppy comes close enough it doesnt matter.  At this point i really wouldnt bother spending any pionts till the other side of EP.  With lots of new OoW gear floating around this stuff will be obsolete.<br />
<br />
Your weapons are fine for now.  Get some LDoN augs if you can, and never ever ever spend points on a rotting fist  :p .  For weaponry i'd really reccomend waiting for a SEWS/BoW first ... grab the first one you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">whats a sews?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stemcell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You're best off hoarding DKP for elem loot, would be best plan for the long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valnir Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't know how accessable this stuff is but theres quite a vew very good weapons in OoW that you might want to consider.  I wouldn't want to be walking around in earth using a Droga combo, but thats just me.<br />
<br />
Also see if AoW gets killed a lot on your server, if he dosn't see if you can talk a bunch of guild buddies to go take him out maybe?  BoC would be great for you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Guy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for suggestions, it's pretty much what I figured. Plus I am missing a few flags, so I'll be able to hoard some DKP through backflagging before I'm actually in Ele's. Like I said, armor wasn't a very big priority because ele's is right around the corner, but my problem is I have no usable raid aggro weapons (we have a strict no push policy on weapon procs). So I really need to pick up something similar to a BoC/something else combo in case of needing to offtank during raids. AoW is something I'm looking into, especially since we have multiple 8-10K buffed tanks, not including our MT. Thanks for the suggestions and keep any others coming you think would be helpful<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In this day and age i'd say forget about the bow. Let the others fight over it and waste pts on it. Get a dual setup, get your augs and save for Raex Helm / Boots / Arms. Gloves are insanely common, equivilent bracers are decently avaliable (tipt (free) / earth). Once your guild is able to routinely put the beat down on the mold dropping mini's i'd say get your epic 1.5 done. OoW has enough options (as with luclin or tallon zek) for offhand proc'rs to last you till the ik trials and beyond.</div></div><hr />

Try the search engine next time. This thread wasn't about defining abbreviations, and http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=4604 is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm pretty sure Raex has a required level of 65. I would do what ever it takes to get level 65 first; this should be your main focus.</div></div><hr />
