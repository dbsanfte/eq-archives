<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vamcoy</div><div class="date">01-09-2005, 03:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive been reading this board over 3 years now when did we call for monk nerfs? I was lurking way back when we where still on ezboard and never do I remember anything about nerfing monks. <br />
  Reason I bring this up is cause thanks to the link that was provided a couple days ago I went on over to MB and saw threads just dripping with hate for warriors about how we nerfed monks and how its our turn to get nerfed. Now I dont know if we do to much damage or if monks do to litte. I dont know if they should get there mitigation back or not. What I do know is that once way back when the monks warriors and rogues worked togther to demand change in the way meele where treated. Warriors used the standown and monks and rogues supported us and all 3 boards had hunderds of posts on threads calling for a change. What has changed why so much hate now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">01-09-2005, 05:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">do we really need another thread about monks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">01-09-2005, 05:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, your post is not a flame, it's more an interresting, well posed, and hate free concerned. However you should have post this in the outhause because you know that trollish monks and warriors will polute this thread.<br />
<br />
For me, our dps boost (since GoD) is intented by SoE. Actually I think it's their answer for our hate generation issue. Remember back in Luclin when we got so many issue with it, and that everybody where supporting us. SoE gave us EB weapons saying &quot;well, this is a rapid fix that we don't like but that is indeed a must. We will try to fix your aggro issue differently in the futur, but for now we are obliged to give pure hate proc to warriors untill we find something else.&quot; <br />
<br />
My bet is that they decided to give us more dps to replace our EB tools. Look at their population upon expensions :<br />
Original : Anathema, but added after PoP.<br />
Kunark : One weak (only?), but added after Luclin.<br />
Velius : the BoC ! (only?), but added after Luclin.<br />
Luclin : half a dozen ?<br />
PoP : some more, including the best (BoW, DBotW).<br />
Ykesha : expension I said, stupid Yoda.<br />
LDoN : A2 &amp; A3 augs.<br />
GoD : one (BBoB, arguably better than DBotW)<br />
OoW : MSC.<br />
<br />
Actually, if you look at our list of aggro weapon, you can see than EB weapons are getting sparcer and sparcer with new expension in favor for dps weapon with or without (depending on thier dps output) a non-EB aggro proc (stun, AC debuff). look at some top aggro 2Her from GoD : Great Maul of the Mighty, Halberd of endless pain, ...  they are all excelent dps weapons with weak proc (DD, tap, none!), same with most of OoW weapons. On one hand we have MSC, Fang of Feratha and thunderclap, and on the other hand we have the two Warspears, Allin's mace, Greatsword of Mortification and many others that I am forgetting right now.<br />
<br />
If my point is true then our DPS isn't gonna decrease  so easily (sorry monks). But there is an sidestep answer to gimp our dps while preserving our dps-aggro: making our domage elemental because elemental domage are gimp but has the same agro power. thus a version of the greatsword of mortification for warrior only could be :<br />

This kind of weapon would have a large impact on aggro, but its dps would be very fluctuating, and would never get close to any DPS classes.<br />
I have much more idees along this one for the &quot;reworking classes envisionment&quot; thread, but I will keep them shut for now, at least in this thread that definitly should be moved to the outhause.<br />

Why not, we have enough about paladins~<br />

O, and Monks got nerfed like 3 years ago.(1 more post till 100) They had their mitigation stolenz!</div></div><hr />

so the monks got their pantys in a bundle, whootpy do. how many warriors are getting enough anguish gear to warrant a gamewide nerf or a boost for monks? half dozen per server?<br />
<br />
some of us are still using Velius weps (boc) so i beg of you, dont make my DPS worse... i think im at bard lvl dps right now, but hey, i got agro. if monks get a dps boost cause of anguish weps, then i want block skill with a 140 cap. seems fair to me. give a little get a little. monks can have their 10k hp and more dps but we get their l33t skillz</div></div><hr />

We don't want any nerfs period. We've been on the short end of the nerf stick before, and I personally don't wish that on anyone.  There's still a lack of actual conclusions backed up by significant data, and a large amount of conflicting data. It's been said before, but the &quot;Nerf Warrior DPS&quot; thread was merely to turn Liper/Pumilio's logic in the mitigation thread back around on him, to hopefully inspire some useful, constructive thought in him. This however did not work, sadly.  :(  All we are asking for, is since so much of our usefullness in other areas (pulling for example) has been removed, that we at least get back to being the #2 melee dps class hands down. But like I said, there's still a lot of data that needs to be come up with/confirmed before any actual decisions should be made.<br />

The casual monk had this sentiment before and after the monk nerf. The nerf that was based upon the top 3-5% of the class that had the AC gear from velious/VT, ended up more affecting the middle to lower levels of the class, while the ones the nerf was aimed at really took minimal notice of it. Just stating this for yet another reason why no one should call for nerfs, but rather be creative and try to come up with a logical solution to fix something. And P.S. SoE: the easiest way isn't always the best, or even the correct way.</div></div><hr />

To make things fair and balanced, put an innate dps reduction on all warriors of 50%, BUT make it so the damage they SHOULD be doing is still added to the agro list. So if normally you would hit for 500, you hit for 250, but produce the same agro as a hit for 500 would! Of course I am only suggesting this out of a sense of balance and fairness in this glorious game known as everquest. Anyone who objects is obviously a retarded troll as this solution of mine is the perfect way to lower warrior dps without damaging agro production. /nod</div></div><hr />

<br />
You should be hating knights! <br />
<br />
They are the ones that started monks on the road to nerfing, with their clever smokescreen tactics in order to divert attention away from the true issues of aggro at the time. It is all so clear now; they have been doing this to the true melee classes all along! Trying to divide them against each other latching on to every other class&#8217;s upgrades they can possibly get, while rubbing out the opposition. You must see the conspiracy for what it is before it is too late and you become nothing more than a pawn in their quest for ultimate power!!!</div></div><hr />

So, just to make all things equal, do the exact same to knights EXCEPT! They dont get the extra agro like warriors do, they dont need it. There, all is fair and balanced in the world of everquest. EVERYTHING I SAY!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I concur.<br />
<br />
More DPS will have a much greater impact on monks then a minor mitigation boost and when looking at classes that should outdamage monks, we see a clear and definite gap, which offers plenty of room for improvement in that department.<br />
<br />
Monks would still need a minor mitigation boost if they really are intended to take hits like chain, but to be frank, i doubt it will be an important issue if DPS was boosted. In other words, after a DPS boost, i suspect a lot of monks wont care about mitigation anymore as an another important monk role gets enforced.<br />
<br />
Now, the entire monk community would've thought of this themselves if it weren't for Pumilio being a party crasher &gt;.&lt;<br />
<br />
Sorry for bumping a monk thread, our class debates simply don't belong here, but i simply had to reply to a good statement ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbanz</div><div class="date">01-17-2005, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Careful what you suggest Grey. You need to be more specific in case an actual dev is reading. If you just say monks need a dps boost then the next expansion will have weapons like 42/10 mnk only dropping from the end game mobs and nothing for any other monks. It would have to be a general from level 1-70 boost to monk dps, just like the mitigation nerf was made general to everyone. A new damage table, my idea of innate stackable haste for every monk that scales from 1-70, something.</div></div><hr />

You see, some people become so jaded, so full of themselves they lose the objective of the game, which is to have fun, when that happen, well, all hell break lose.<br />

Instead of focusing on making his gaming time enjoyable, he felt the need to blame everyone else.<br />

Yeah, the game is not perfect, it probably will never be. The pet class of the moment might be the next useless class.<br />
