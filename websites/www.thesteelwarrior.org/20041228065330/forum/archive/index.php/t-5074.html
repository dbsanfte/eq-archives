If we are going to have this system, I hope some shiney day down the road we can jack up our pool or mitigate the cost of usage.<br />
<br />
Granted, it takes quite alot of work to drain your bar in a single fight, but on fight or zerg battle that takes longer than 10 minutes, you may be in a situation where you want to use defensive or evasive a second time and be SOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinaabi</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far, there are no items that do +END or +END regen. Of course, items that max sta/dex/str/agi will increase the overall END pool.<br />
<br />
If I am not mistaken, SoE stated that there will be no +END regen focus items or spells. However, there will be +END items in the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't know what buff(s) it was that increased the pool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShaikYerbooty</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've noticed that a low level Shaman spell, &quot;Invigor&quot;, has been reclassified.<br />
<br />
Now it requires level 255, meaning you can't use it, for all the classes that used to use it....with the exception of Beastlord and one other, Enchanter I believe.<br />
<br />
For the BL it's a 16th or so level spell now.  Is this an oversight on the part of SOE, or perhaps does this spell now refill the Endurance pool slightly but only by one or two classes?</div></div><hr />
