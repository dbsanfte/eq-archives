One of the few places you can get a group will be Dawn Shroud Peak.  XP group is always limited to a few zones for any level, unless you bring your own group there. World of EQ is huge, yet so small.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 07:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You might be able to find some people hunting in Neth lair; I recently leveled an alt and found some folks there--not many, but they happened to know how to play. There are usually groups in M. Seru.<br />
Loot's not that great in these places, though.<br />
You can try the spires outside Splitpaw in South K.; often folks are just soloing there, however. Gnolls drop fine steel weapons, though, and you can probably take the gnolls solo. It's a long run out there.<br />
You can also try High Hold Keep.<br />
And don't forget LDoNs.<br />
In a couple of levels you can try the Overthere and then the Dreadlands.<br />
For loot, you'll probably start to notice that farming in certain areas will result in better loot than you'll get in most experience zones. Any kind of silk will sell well in the bazaar. You can hunt spiders in East K (and the lions, which drop hides that sell well in bazaar); You can also travel to Shadeweavers and kill worms and rockhoppers (silks and hides again).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sol-A is a good zone at level 26-30 too. To my knowledge it and HHK have the highest available ZEM's at that level. I've gone there pl'ing people lots of times, and oftentimes there are even people grouping there. Good old-school dungeon crawl experience for sure, if you can avoid all the trains from the epic-farmers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are still blue sections of Upper Guk at that level (the highest area of the zone is at the Ghoulbane guy, and it's good til level 32 or 33), and it is faster XP there than in Sol A, similar loot and easier mobs.  However, you will have to cope with runners and shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TigermaneCT</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You could also go to South Karana and pound the gnolls at the spires (bring lots of band-aids if your cruisin solo) sit there for a couple of levels then head into split paw.  Decent cash there with the Fine steel drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">big_sven</div><div class="date">06-15-2004, 06:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try Lake of Ill Omen.<br />
If you camp by the goblin ruins on the West side of the lake you can pick off the patrolling mobs and later on you'll be able to pull from the ruins itself.<br />
I'm almost lvl 31 and have been at LOIO since about lvl 25. Its a quiet zone and you'll be able to pull singly very easily. Watch out for the ruins though- there are about 5-6 gobs in there at one time - pull one and you probably pull three. <br />
Decent cash drops of 2-3 plat and the occasional gem is nice.<br />
However its a nasty run through Firiona Vie to LOIO-make sure you have a SOW before you start.</div></div><hr />

As I recall Sol A has a higher ZEM than upper guk.  Also as I recall the only times I have tried fighting in upper guk at the &quot;appropriate&quot; levels were pre-kunark but man that place sucked for mob pathing and difficulty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">06-15-2004, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The ZEM list that I have looks like this: (only the portion relevant to this discussion shown)<br />
 <br />
Befallen-114% bonus<br />
Crushbone-114% bonus<br />
Paludal Caverns-114% bonus<br />
 <br />
High Keep-100% bonus<br />
Upper Guk-100% bonus<br />
Kurn's Tower-100% bonus<br />
The Warrens-100% bonus<br />
 <br />
Najena-73% bonus<br />
Solusek's Eye-73% bonus<br />
The Estate of Unrest-73% bonus<br />
 <br />
POP Planes-59% bonus<br />
...<br />
 <br />
In trying most of these with my untwinked twink, it seemed accurate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeritum</div><div class="date">06-15-2004, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">EQdiva has an excellent compilation of the ZEM listings.<br />
<br />
However, after having levelling this Warrior from level 1 to level 56 basing my experiencing solely on the list found there, I've begun to wonder if in fact the base experience of specific zones is in fact higher than that of other zones.  I understand this goes against years of what people have believed, however I have found that dark blue mobs that are one level in some zones with high ZEMS happen to apparently give the same amount of experience (or less) than lower level cons in zones with equal ZEMs.<br />
<br />
This is the link: http://www.eqdiva.com/eq/zoneLevels.aspx<br />
<br />
An example of what I'm speaking of goes something like this: Estate of Unrest and Solusek A both have a 73% ZEM. However, the level of mobs in Solusek A are higher, yet I would get more exprience killing in Unrest than I would killing in Solusek A at any given level between 25-29. Two likely, although not the only 2 possible, explainations would be either the ZEM info given is inaccurate, or base exp/mob compared to level of character exping is higher in certain zones than in others.<br />
<br />
edit: when I state I would get more experience killing in Unrest, I mean on a kill by kill basis. Certainly the mobs in Unrest would have less HP, thus granting faster kills and faster overall experience, but that is not what I was referring to. Whereas I might get 2%exp/kill in Unrest, I'd get less in Sola.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still think that fighting in upper guk at the appropriate levels is bad xp if nothing else because the zone pathing sucks horribly! heh heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shirion</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">High Keep was always my favorite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Didnt they add that &quot;hot spot&quot; crappola a couple months back for lower lvl players?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It depends, Gorlab. My twink was a ranger, so fleeing mobs were no issue at all. When you can eliminate the fleeing, Upper Guk is definitely both faster and easier XP than Sol A. Upper Guk is simply not worth the hassle if you don't have snare, and since most people don't have snare, it remains empty 99% of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorlab</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well like I think I said, the last time I was there at a &quot;level appropriate&quot; time was pre-kunark.  Some RL friends and I started over and we had level approrpriate gear with a group of Warrior, Enchanter, Cleric, Druid, Shaman, Warrior all good to excellent quality players and we were just unable to xp in upper guk.  Thinking more, I suspect strongly that things would be different now with all the mudflation, we were in banded, empty jewelry slots and everything with me wielding dual langseaxes I think.  But at any rate the exact same group went to sol a and just cleaned house and had a blast with zero deaths.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ibithor</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">upper guk sux, it seems to have a lot of healers and buffers so all the mobs are harder than they should be and they run at low life iirc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In places like Upper Guk, shaman mobs are just slightly harder than warriors, and are definitely easier than wizard mobs (which are all too common in Sol A).  Their heals can't keep up with untwinked melee damage.<br />
 <br />
Shaman mob spells are pitiful until you start fighting level 34 shaman mobs (the ones with wolf pets, e.g. Lower Guk). The level 34 shaman spell set is FAR more dangerous than all previous spell sets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 07:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I liked High Keep as well.I usually leveled there from 25-35 in a couple of nights before the group xp mods.On Stromm it was too busy for me,but, a lot of the fastest levelers stayed there until low 50's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oron</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 07:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive been all over 2-boxing my beast/druid, and Gunthak has been very very nice exp.  In the last patch they added a PoK book that goes straight there, which was always why it was so empty.  Used to be a serious pain to get to/from.  (picked up a lot of ports with my druid though)<br />
I started there with both characters at 30, and there are PLENTY of blues -&gt; red mobs to beat up on.  Half are undead and dont run.  If you fight on the shore, the ones that do run tend to run into the water, which is good.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />

I think its really interesting to hear you say this.  We thought the wizards in sol a were the easiest mobs because with two warriors + a cleri to stun we would just interrupt their spells and they wouldn't do any damage at all to us! heh heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barli</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Historically, Highhold Keep (HHK) was one of the best ways to zoom from post-Paludal Caverns up to level 34.  Used to be notorious for over-crowdedness and whiners galore.   Now.... its a virtual graveyard.  Mostly all you see is higher levels hunting guards and nobles for plat or alt's going thru thier 8th iteration of HHK.<br />
<br />
I've recently leveled up a cleric and a zerker in HHK.   Same old area except now a lot less competition for the stairs area and WR/RR.   The loot isn't bad for the level.   I found that once you get to level 31 you can solo there fairly easily.  Just bring a lot of bandages with you for healing up.</div></div><hr />
