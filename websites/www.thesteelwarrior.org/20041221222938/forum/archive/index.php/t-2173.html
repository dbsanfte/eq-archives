<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greug</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 05:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all, i am to be concidered a newbie warrior when it comes ot most of you, i've been playing Everquest for the total of 7 months now (give or take a few weeks)<br />
<br />
Due to a slap of faith in my face, i've for some reason been pushed into learned quick and thoroughly, but there are some aspects that still leave me wondering due to the various input i've heard from RL player friends and online friends in EQ.<br />
<br />
Currenly i'm a 57 Troll Warrior and i'm currently Main Tank on about all the guild raids we do (only warrior in guild that's 55+)<br />
<br />
I've been wondering now recently, at lvl 57 what is to be concidered &quot;good&quot; AC/HP ?<br />
<br />
Also, should i be thinking about going on AA's yet, or wait till i hit lvl 60 as some people have told me (apparently it's faster to get AA's at lvl 60?)<br />
<br />
Also, if i am going to AA's, where would i be seeing best to get decent grind groups? Planes? or out of plane zones for the AA's<br />
<br />
Which AA's should i be going for good measure (we have plenty of DPS classes in our group to pull the raw numbers so i guess defense, what is the best AA point cost efficient way to get to the defensive AA's?)<br />
<br />
I'll be posting later tonight a link and a request to see what equipment i should be upgrading after i get magelo updater running again :) (kinda fubared on my system atm)<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance for the replies.<br />

ok typing that line woke me up a bit<br />
i havnt been exping in the planes much since veksar/droga/chardb<br />
i love those zones and are good exp 57-60</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you dont have any AA's now, you'll have to go thru at least 6 AA's till you can START ND.  If you want, lvl to 60 and then do AA's, should be much faster.  I'm usually MT in my guild and I have noticed a difference tanking the same type raids when Im lvl 61 vs lvl 63 now.  More lvl's means better stuff for you.  Im trying and pushing hard toward 65 then working on my defensive AA's.  <br />
<br />
Good thing about lvl 65 is that all ure exp can go into AA's and you just keep improving.  Also the Con of the things you're fighting helps a butt load.  Things that con red use to kick my butt, but now they con blue and it's a breeze to fight em.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for AA's, I would get Run3 ASAP then level to 60 in PoN/PoI. Switch to PoD and level to 62, swith to PoV and level to 65 then go AA.<br />
<br />
(I think I went ND3 first, but that was because I had sucky DE HP)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stommper</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to help explain the whole&quot; AAs come faster at 60 than 51&quot; issue. Note that 1 AA takes about the same xp as getting thru level 51. If you are level 51 and trying to earn an AA point, it will be the same speed as getting level 51 because of the level of mobs you are killing. But when you are 60, you will (should!) be killing higher level mobs that give more xp, so you get more AA xp per kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been wondering now recently, at lvl 57 what is to be concidered &quot;good&quot; AC/HP ? <br />
<br />
I would say that about 1200ish AC should be fine, more is always better tho.  HP's...3K at least, shooting for 3500+ at 60 if you can(I did not make it myself, think I was at 3200 at 60).  Note that the hp's are far more important than the AC.  If you are having trouble making the 1200 AC, I would not worry about it too much.<br />
<br />
Also, should i be thinking about going on AA's yet, or wait till i hit lvl 60 as some people have told me (apparently it's faster to get AA's at lvl 60?) <br />
<br />
Run3 is a good bet, I would get that one out of the way, after that, I would do no more till at least  level 60, and if you are not having real trouble and can put it off, level 65.  You will get a greater return on your time spent going 100 % regular exp than by doing AA's, with the assumption that you have enough hp's and are able to tank the exp mobs at those levels.  The difference between level 60 and 65 is night and day, while the difference between aa's is definatly not.<br />
<br />
Another consideration here is to realize that after you level past 60, you have cut out much of the old world as a good source of exp.  If you enjoy exping in PoP zones, this should not matter much, but if you prefer old world, it might.<br />
<br />
Also, if i am going to AA's, where would i be seeing best to get decent grind groups? Planes? or out of plane zones for the AA's <br />
<br />
PoP zones are about the best source of AA(and regular) exp.  They can also be horribly dull.  If you want fastest, then planes.  If you want a little more fun, check out some old world, especially the newly revamped zones.<br />
<br />
Which AA's should i be going for good measure  <br />
<br />
After run3, I would suggest regen 3, followed by ND 3, followed by AE taunt.  That is 23 aa's, so should keep you busy for at least a little while:) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Levels! You get a huge bump from 60-61 in HP and the like (i.e., SoE wants us to buy PoP and since we have no wimpy spells to be concerned with, that was the carrot).  At that time, as others noted, get your Baron 6 and move on to ND3. <br />
<br />
I would never recommend hunting in PON but mostly that is because PON is one big train fest on Povar.  I'd recommend, instead, POD right or left courtyard; Droga; or POS dillo camps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Macnair</div><div class="date">07-26-2003, 12:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am going to take a completely differnt approach to this and say...<br />
<br />
NO AA's at all til your level 65<br />
<br />
Level in the PoP<br />
<br />
Post in the bunker about AC/HP and include your god,  how much you have to spend,  your server and your guilds raid abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-26-2003, 02:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good rule of thum seems to be you want AC &gt; 20* level.<br />
<br />
To answer your AA question, if you like the cluster of guilds and poeple you are with, and seem to be finding yourself out leveling them (which it sounds a bit like) I would get 60th and then start AAing so you don't outstrip your guildmates. If you all are exping at the same rate, levels definatly.<br />
<br />
AAs should be Run3, Regen/Stm/or Metabolism 3, then ND3, AE Taunt...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">07-27-2003, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get run3 then level to 65 then do AA.  Your guild will really benefit from having you, as MT, as high as possible.  I think you will find that at 65 tanking yellow stuff is much easier than tanking barely blue stuff was at 60.  Compared to what its like now at 57 for you, you will destroy the things you currently have trouble killing and this will accelerate the progress of everyone in your guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bakaris</div><div class="date">07-27-2003, 04:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">imo 65 before any AA's at all... 65 is so important to be if your MT!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyndrusher</div><div class="date">07-27-2003, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 57, a good ac to shoot for would be 1150 or so .. don't worry about cracking 1200-1250 until you hit 60.  And I agree, 3500hp is a good target to shoot for, and shouldn't be too hard, depending on what you guys are raiding.<br />
<br />
As for aa .. get 60 first.  Then do your run3 and regen3 .. the do PPand PD as they become available (i.e. get 61, then PD1 and PP1, get lvl 62, then get PP2, get lvl 63, then get PP3 and PD2, etc, etc) .. this is so you get the most HP for your buck so to speak, as you level.<br />
<br />
PoI is probably your best bet to get you to 60/61 quickly (fast kills).  PoV (wasteland mobs) / PoS (frog caves, dillos, giants) will be slower, but more xp per kill.<br />
<br />
After that work on your defensive aa .. you can have all the offensive aa in the world, won't mean a darned thing if you're dead though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greug</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 05:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">EDIT:: Will post magelo profile when magelo's  site is back up and running<br />
<br />
First off, wow, thanks for the advice guys :)<br />
i'll be trying to answer to everyone with the info :)<br />
<br />
Currently at lvl 57, i'm only at around 2300 HP unbuffed (so seems i gotta work on that)<br />
Venril Sathir is a pretty low population server and was blue when it started, so the monetairy ammount available to me is kinda &quot;limited&quot;<br />
<br />
current AC with my self clicky buffs is around 1100+ tho, been looking for some pieces of armour with AC/HP on it and STA (pricy things on our server)<br />
<br />
Recently i've been getting random invites for the LC in PoV (which, is a rough fight but manegable with a good group) and Plane of Nightmare for the Kobolds/wraith camps (did i say we are a low pop server? not many warriors around)<br />
<br />
I'm slightly outlevelling my guild expect for a few players who spend their time solo'ing and quadding (Wizies in guild come to mind) And our Shaman who's discovered the art of torpor tanking in the planes on his own)<br />
So perhaps for the best of the guild i'll be pushing through till 65 asap to ensure the guild has a good MT instead of a semi lvl tank like now :)<br />
<br />
We're kinda known by other midlvl guilds on our server to try, and usually manage to take down mobs we shouldn't have any business raiding yet :)<br />
Avg lvl's of raids often at 51 while the raid target is 55+ (hey it takes a few tries sometimes but we do manage to get our tactic down straight to get in the kill)<br />
The problem mainly is tho, due to the high ammount of casters in the guild compared to meelee classes our raid targets are usually geared towards caster item drops.<br />
<br />
I think i'll take the advice to go over 60 asap as provided by some people here, and hopefully i can get our raid targets more geared to some warrior usuable drops.<br />
We've been single grouping in Veksar up to and a little past the golems (weapon drop for guildies) etc.  But might have to start looking out for some other farming grounds for money/items to buy upgrades it seems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dainin</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had thought about going run3 and then hittin 65th level myself. <br />
But, I watched my wife play her 62 Bard in a group that had <br />
a 58th level warrior who could out tank me (At the time) and <br />
was only in so/so gear (Nothing special). I asked her to have a <br />
chat with the guy, and see where he went with his AA's <br />
(Had a vet tag on his name) He had gone defensive AA's yer <br />
basic. run3 regen3 ND3 CA3 CS3 etc. Now... I'm not sayin <br />
screw leveling and go AA's. But, if you push past the hell level <br />
that is 60 to say 61 or 62 and switch up to AA's yer not gunna <br />
be sorry. I started my own juant into them at 20% through <br />
level 62, and I now have 7k hp (Shaman &amp; cleric buffed) and a <br />
base HP (unbuffed) around the 5k marker. I've gotten thus far: <br />
ND3 then my PE class AA and CA1. Since I am a DE warrior... <br />
And we lack on the HP/stam, I went run3 and stam3 in my <br />
general. I'm going exp now to get to 63 before putting anymore <br />
into AA's (Since there are alot of nice PoP advanced ones that <br />
can help add some HP to my current total) then I'll more then <br />
likely make the push to 65th.  <br />
<br />
Just so you know. The AA's come in quite quickly at 62. PoV around 3% AA per kill, PoS around 1-2% per kill, BoT 3-4% per kill and HoH 3-5% per kill. Just my 2cp to help ya make a choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the do PPand PD as they become available (i.e. get 61, then PD1 and PP1, get lvl 62, then get PP2, get lvl 63, then get PP3 and PD2, etc, etc) .. this is so you get the most HP for your buck so to speak, as you level. <br />
<br />
PP and PD are terrible aa's for raising hp's.  I, with about 5 K hp's at 65, spent the 3 points for PD 1 and got a whopping 60ish hp's.  PD is 3 aa points for 1.5 % hp's, compared to ND which is 2 points for 2 %, then 4 points for 3 %, then 6 points for 5 %.  Much better bang for your buck.  PP will only raise your hp's if your STA is already maxed, and then by a small amount.  ND3 is far and away the best value for gaining hp's, followed by PE(because you get mitigation and evasion with it).  PD will be the AA I take the rest of when I finish all the other defensive aa's, certainly not first, and without question not till finishing the track to AE taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A lot of folks do <br />

Regen3 (or whatever)<br />
ND3<br />
CA1<br />
CS1<br />
PE<br />
CA3<br />
CS3<br />
etc . . . <br />
<br />
ND3 gives ya some nice HP gains for your lvl.  CA and CS are only increased by 1 first because people have found that PE is the best cost vs gains AA as it effects ND, CA, and CS.  Then they get the rest of CS and CA after PE.  (or thats what I would do)</div></div><hr />

Once your equip is obviously outdated then I would start working on aa's.<br />
<br />
The defensive aa are great if you can keep agro but if your losing agro then tatical mastery or stalward endurance are both very nice.<br />
<br />
That said, CA aa's are probably the best investment then hp and CS aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greug</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 04:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know alot of it depends on what kind of group you play with, but as xp'ing generally happens with over half a group being guildies, agro isn't that much of a problem, they know what i can/can't do, and everyone plays according to the limitations of the other classes :) (love my guild for that!)<br />
<br />
I'm keeping fairly okay agro with using<br />

in main hand<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics19/Naraithus.jpg<br />
<br />
I am starting to get worried as i start Xp'ing in area's where mobs frequently (read, 7 out of 10 times) hit for more then 200 on each hit that connects<br />
<br />
So think i'll do a few &quot;quick&quot; lvl's to 60 and then take the first few AA's that give a nice payoff in defence before continueing the XP grind to 65 if for nothing else then to keep getting group invites :)<br />
<br />
(die once too often in XP groups and you stop getting asked to come tank)<br />
<br />
i wonder when ratty Mag'll be back online eh :t(<br />
<br />
ps: i KNOW that piercing isn't the best choice for a warrior in any way, but, alas it's the best i could do with the money i had (50pp) was kinda stint at that moment in time.<br />
<br />
pps: after i parse the dmg, i'll see which one is better, that, or defender's lightsword :)</div></div><hr />
