Shadowknight Epic Effect:<br />

http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1930&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
Now, I'll grant you the SHD epic effect is kinda lame, compared to the other two and their agro generation, but it also has the best resist check at MR -200.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>proteg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd say CHSD is easier to get then the Epic :P<br />
<br />
The point you were making is very interesting though.  Doesn't make sense at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Heimdall-RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">CHSD?  OK that's why I was confused.  CHSD is Cord Hilted Spike Driver right?  PoI hammer.  But its a 1 hander.  I'm offhanding it now.  I said easiest two hander with innate hate proc.<br />
<br />
I figured it out the hard way when I was tanking Gaukr a little while ago... I didn't quite trust the cleric so I wanted to switch to a 2 hander, and the proc is resisted by all the Sand giants.  :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Heimdall-RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Is not a purely Hate based Proc.  Admittedly the warrior epic proc has a damage base to it, however that's secondary to the Hate.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Is not a purely Hate based Proc.<br />
And that matters why? And then why did you compare it to the procs of the knight weapons, neither of which proc pure aggro effects? The GSoT is far BETTER than the proc of the 2h epic, since it generates aggro whether it is resisted or not. Not to mention a superior dam/delay, and the fact that it is available for a few hundred plat. Quit yer bitchin'</div></div><hr />

I get your drift, I do ... but this is not what you said at first.  Lemme isolate what I'm pointing at ...<br />

I'm agreeing that the answer to your original question is *cough* GSoT *cough*.  The answer to the question you perhaps intended to ask is prolly along the lines of &quot;old content&quot; + /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Heimdall-RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, I got somewhat distracted by the comparison of epics.  Mostly I looked at the Pally Fiery Defender, and realized that it proc'ed about the same damage, AND a stun component that probably generates comparable agro, AND has a negative resist modifer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You realize you still get aggro even if it's resisted right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Heimdall-RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Is it the same agro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Dunno.<br />
<br />
My experience with it was in Skyfire Mountains against the wurms.<br />
<br />
They're completely fire resistant and my proc never landed on them.<br />
<br />
But, everytime it was resisted, I got the same results as I did when it landed on other monsters. The wurm would turn on me.<br />
<br />
My rogue friend even helped me with this little anecdotal experiment, by actively seeking to steal aggro. And once he got aggro, everytime I got a resisted proc the mob would turn back onto me.<br />
<br />
In any event, I've not had aggro issues from the epic due to the spell being resisted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Heimdall-RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The reason I point that out is because, for example, on enchanter stun/DD's you will still land your DD and get a message saying your target is immune to the stun portion of this effect.  You get no such partial message from the epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&quot;on enchanter stun/DD's you will still land your DD and get a message saying your target is immune to the stun portion of this effect.&quot;<br />
<br />
That's different though.<br />
<br />
That's not a spell resist.<br />
<br />
Think of it as resisted slow. You just get the resisted message. But you obviously get some aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The easiest 2hander with a &quot;purely Hate based proc&quot; to get is a rusty scythe with AngerII augment.  <br />
I wish people would just stop going on about epics. They're obsolete. If you have yours, grats on completing a complicated, difficult quest. Now go to the bazaar and get a far superior weapon for 100pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>seveirn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">it wouldnt go under the pure hate department , but you could always look at a Garudek, Sword of the Sky , Nice agro weapon there. 2HS.<br />
<br />
Or , Mabye Ornate Greatsword from Sol ro, Taunting blow 2HS<br />
<br />
Or, Anethema From inny in new hate , Enraging blow.</div></div><hr />

They wont care about the dmg/delay when they see what they look like --Warrior Epic Designer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think the design team has missed an important principle.<br />
<br />
I played baseball a whole lot as a kid (I love baseball analogies). From the age of 10 to 16 my favorite glove hung from the left-hand spindle on the footboard of my bed.<br />
<br />
Every item in the game, every weapon, piece of armor, (with very few exceptions) is disposable. But not my epic. Other things I was awarded in raids or bought. I feel that I earned my epic in a quest that elevated me from a shabbily equipped Dwarf Warrior to a Hero - at least in my own mind.<br />
<br />
My Epic hangs on a peg in my safe deposit box in the bank. Ocassionally I still take it out and close my hand over it's hilt and remember Starlen, Baltistol, and other guildmates long departed and the roar of a dragon in the Emerald Jungle.<br />
<br />
Like it would kill you to make an Epic Only aug for each class and let us take it off the peg once in awhile and relive when we were Heros.<br />
<br />
RAAAARRRRR! /em Waves the Jagged Blade of War defiently overhead RAAAAARR!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Battleblade</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Y'know what the first thing I thought about was when I saw the stats on the warrior Epic ?<br />
<br />
&quot;24 Delay ? wtf ?&quot;<br />
&quot;ohh, cool looking though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Probably never gonna finish my Epic until I can solo the whole way, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Heimdall-RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It IS still relatively useful.  36/44 isn't entirely BAD...  Personally I think all weapons already WITH a proc should have gotten a Slot 5 or a Slot 6... either pure damage increase, or a DMG:Type slot, but that would have required more than the minimum effort.<br />
<br />
Epic weapons do need an upgrade, but if they didn't get it right the first time, why should we push for them getting it more wrong.  <br />
<br />
Facts:<br />
<br />
The warrior epic is the only tank epic that doesn't have a negative resist adjustment.<br />
<br />
The warrior epic is in the middle of the three tank epics from a Damage per delay stat standpoint.<br />
<br />
The warrior epic is the only weapon in the game with a direct hate boost that is resistable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The warrior epic has bene obsolete for 3 years now.  They haven't changed it in all of that time.  Give it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">&quot;They haven't changed it in all of that time. &quot;<br />
<br />
That's funny ... I couldn't ALWAYS wield two red blades.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
While I agree with you, the epic is quite obsolete ... they have changed it ONCE in all of that time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">By the time most people get their epic, it's useless as anything but a trophy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It's 36/41, not 36/44 omg.<br />
<br />
I find that if I'm having trouble holding agro with just a weapon that stuns, I can whip out the 2hs epic and hold it np. Sure my dps goes down, but that's not what I'm there for :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>victatious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">has anyone put anger III on the 2H epic yet and test its agro holding ability yet? If im correct shouldnt it hold agro pretty nice esp with incite line as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">&quot;The warrior epic is the only weapon in the game with a direct hate boost that is resistable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Copper Hammer of Striking's proc is certainly resistable. And yet it still seems to do ok.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
&quot;has anyone put anger III on the 2H epic yet and test its agro holding ability yet? If im correct shouldnt it hold agro pretty nice esp with incite line as well?&quot;<br />
<br />
2hand epic with anger 3 would be fine. Blade of War with Anger 3 would be even better. That's sort of the premise people work under. Why put the one A-3 augment in the epic, when they've usually abandoned their epic a long time ago. Greatstaff of Thunder has a hate generating proc. Has better DPS. So two hate procs on the GSoT would be a tad more effective than 2 on the epic, or so the logic goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>salandius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">neither a CHoS or a GSoT have a direct haste boost, they are both stuns...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Anger on DBOW is resistable, although not very often (MR -400) but it does get resisted on stuff like Emperor Ssraeshza, Bristlebane when he does his magic immune ability, and there's a bunch of stuff in LDoN raids crazy resists that'll probably resist it too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">&quot;neither a CHoS or a GSoT have a direct haste boost, they are both stuns...&quot;<br />
<br />
Neither does blade of war. I think Executioner's Axe does though.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, if you're talking about HATE boost ... I really think this board, and community needs to make up its mind.<br />
<br />
On the one hand, paladins are overpowered because they get stuns. On the other hand, direct hate is better.<br />
<br />
On the one hand, Frodlin says stun proccing weapon is superior to a hate proccing weapon. On the other people advocate anger augment, anger augment, anger augment.<br />
<br />
One the one hand, people don't give a rat's ass that a stun proc gets resisted by mobs, because it's hate is still solid and noticable. On the other hand these same people like to decry the warrior epic because the spell gets resisted. Never once bothering to notice it STILL does its job, and GETS AGGRO.<br />
<br />
In short ... make up your mind about stuns, procs and hate ... and get back to me.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Stats are time quality on the 2 hander? You need to go look at some time loot before you start comparing something with 100 hp, 50 total resists, 15 STA, and absolutely nothing else of real worth to a time item.<br />
<br />
Sure, during Kunark it was godly, but as soon as the 2 handed weapon readjustment happened in early Velious, it was subpar.</div></div><hr />
