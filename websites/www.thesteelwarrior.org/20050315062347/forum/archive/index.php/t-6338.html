<br />
At the high end, I see lots of wars using two 1h weapons with innate procs auged with anger procs to hold agro.  However, with mobs that riposte for 1200, 1800, 2500+, how do you justify doing that over a single 2h weapon properly augmented?  <br />
<br />
From what I remember, the dps should be higher anyway with the 2h, but the real issue is that the riposte's should be less.  Right?  Do you loose a huge % of procs using 2h or something?<br />
<br />
What am I missing?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IN most cases agro is of greater concern than damage taken.  Ripostes from a mob that is unslowable and quads at 1.2 seconds is a SMALL portion of the total damage done.  Of course, I still htink opening with furious with a good two hander and continuing to use it through the fight is better than using two one handers.  <br />
<br />
And on mobs that are slowable and only double their dps is so low that increasing the dps by 50% because you are dual wielding isn' t much of a concern, unless perhaps, you are two boxing/duoing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakryn</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Many high end warriors arent worried about ripostes in EXP groups ;)<br />
If needed most wars will bust out a shield or a BoW when going up against mobs where the riposte can be killer.But if a war has a DB/EoE etc at his disposal ,cant beat it for exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaiel</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two 1h weapons are much more reliable in getting quick aggro than 2h weapons, and if you have a Darkblade/EoE, it's better DPS as well, not to mention more AC/HP.  The added stats, aggro, and DPS outweigh any increased damage from ripostes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are some thing you have to keep in mind about riposte that people usually don't understand. First of all, you have to understand that riposte rates are very low, just a small percentage of total swings. The deceptive thing about ripostes came from a parse a while back that attributed a large percentage of a mob's DPS to riposte. The misconception stemmed from this due to the fact that a) the mob in the pasrse was 70% slowed and b) while the % increase was large, the amount of damage taken was negligible in the grand scheme of things. The difference in healing required to keep up with riposte damage was not a problem.<br />
<br />
The reason many people opt for 2h on big hitters is not so much for the increase in DPS of the mob, but rather the increased chance of a tank being 1 rounded. As the chances of being 1 rounded go down, the usefulness of using a 2her is smaller. Most high end warriors have such a small chance of being 1 rounded on most mobs, that the extra agro is much more important than a .05% chance of being 1 rounded.<br />
<br />
From the perspective of a DPS class, 1h is far and away the better choice. The increase in hate procs allows for a substancial increase in DPS, which makes fights shorter. The shorted a fight is, the less likely you are to lose the MT.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My take on it is that so long as I hold aggro, it doesn't really matter.  If I am able to hold aggro consistantly with a 2H, I would rather stick with it and take a little less riposte damage (and do a little more DPS, too).  If I can't seem to hold aggro with a 2H, then I'll switch to Dual-wielding.  My current problem is that the only 2H aggro weapon I have is a JBoW, so more often than not I have to Dual-wield.  I'm hoping soon that we will kill Innoruuk so that I can get Anethema and aug it.  I definitely prefer 2Hers over Dual-Wielding.  Thankfully most of the other Warriors in the guild are set on a BoC/BF combo, so I shouldn't really have any competition, hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For exp this seems to vary as not all exp mobs are equal (high end is kinda a nebulous term these days). GoD/ellie planes exp seem to have reasonable riposte rates; hard ldon seems to have high (pure subjectivity on my part).  As such I use DW in the former and 2h in the later.  The gettin 1 rounded aspect I think comes into play at a level of GoD I havent touched yet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1h vs 2h is a very very simple arguement assuming you can hold aggro with both types of weapons.  If your gear is marginal and you find yourself zerking a lot or dying as soon as your disc wears by all means use a 2h and cut down on riposte damage, and also dont kick or bash.  If aggro is an issue A you probably shouldnt be tanking anyway and B you may wanna use 2hs just to ensure you have aggro.  In summary 2h is used when the margin of error on a mob is very very small warrior/rotation wise.  Most end game warriors use 2 weapons for 2 reasons.  1 is they are marginally higher dps, 2 they have better combined stats, and 3 the margin of error on pop mobs is significantly lower than someone who has just gotten into elementals or time.  You also have to consider the riposte rate on god mobs far far lower than it is on pop mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celestias</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also no good warrior keeps attack on 100% of the time when tanking anyway on a mob that they know is beating them up on a raid, 2 proc's gives you much better lock on aggro for you to put a 90ac shield4% 210hp shield or the like and attack off using mastruq and anger proc's from 1 wep to hold the aggro with higher mitigation and less ripsotes than using 2 weapons once you have aggro if the warrior chooses to, I prefer sword + shield for tanking hard mobs over 2h because of that reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't understand the point of using 2 weapons for aggro because no one ever seems to use up that much aggro in my guild except for one Necro.  If you can turn around after your disc run out to put a shield that means aggro surely wasn't an important part of that fight to let you get away with doing something like that.<br />
<br />
Anyway I've gone back to using 2H weapons in Uqua just because Aura of Destruction kills DPS (29/25 Jagged Onyx Staff looks more like a 15/25 weapon in there) so might as well go with something that has a high damage bonus.  I DW elsewhere for marginally more damage but seeing no one uses Vanazir anymore I'm willing to bet that having a Nightmares on a mob adds more melee DPS overall than the difference between my DW and 2H does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cafard</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You need to get aggro as fast as possible in the beginning of the fight. Dual wielding is good for that (unless you engage with furious) because you will have more chance to proc. <br />
Once your weapons have procced a few time switch your offhand weapon for shield for the rest of the fight.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PinaduzRZ</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I generally use 2h when tanking in Time, 1h tanking in GoD.  The riposte rate for mobs in PoP seems considerably higher than that for GoD (sorry no parses, just casual observation).  But then mobs in GoD die so much faster they have less chance to riposte.  <br />
<br />
Aggro is not really an issue, just the fluke chance of getting 1 rounded by riposte.  Bigger issue atm is mobs warping through walls.<br />

<br />
Good info.  Since the war is at that 'marginal' line, I think the 2h is probably still the way to go.  No one ever gets hit but the war, so I'm gonna say agro ain't an issue.  <br />
<br />
Seems like at the VERY high end, 1h weapons give a tad more agro, add a tad more dps, have a tad more procs, and take a tad more dps from riposte's.   And, that opens options and choices.  I like the offhand shield idea... now I just need to get a really good shield. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torrin</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't dual wield unless I had a darkblade in my mainhand.  The darkblade is the only weapon yet known that makes dual wielding worth using IMO.  I also wouldn't use it unless it was augmented.  Compared to a Vanazir or BoW, anyway.<br />
<br />
But if you can, darkblade + anger 3 and EoE/onyx + anger 3 is the best way to go, IMO.  As has been already said, using this high aggro combo then switching to your shield after disc is a nice tactic.  Before augments, CE, and WA5, I considered the darkblade sub-par.  But the more +procing junk you add, the better dual wield gets compared to 2h in terms of hate generation, to the point where the gap becomes quite large.<br />
<br />
Also it is important to note that the darkblade is actually slower than a BoW, which means LESS ripostes when you equip a shield.  I would never begin fights with a shield, but while youre in disc, you don't have to worry about being one rounded.<br />
<br />
I did some rather lengthy parses on a green mob (katta banker), and determined that a Darkblade + EoE was roughly twice the ripostes as a Blade of War.  But a green mob isn't exactly real-world, so take it as you will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gakmag</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think a dbow/eoe (or the god wep i cant remember) combo is very nice, but unless you can get that, you can stay with a 2hand as long as you have enough aggro, imo.<br />
I hope this help.<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its simple. BoC, Bloodfrenzy, Hategiver, TB Hammer, whatever, are shit simple to get and at that point in the game, and not all warriors can get their hands on a Blade of War, or Vanazir, and thats really the only two weapons that can hold their own for agro against those one handers. Who cares if your taking ripostes if your not taking damage? You can always switch to a 2h after Defensive wears out.. and if you can survive with 2h with defensive out, then ripostes with 1h is a non issue.</div></div><hr />

BoC and Tb maybe easy to get, but the others are not. Simple yes, easy no.<br />
Cant think of how many times Ive killed cursed and have never seen a BF.Done XTC just a few times and no Hategiver(I know its even more rare).<br />
Being simple doesnt mean you will ever see one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We killed about 50 creators, and got 3 EB hammers (yes, really heh :/) and killed 30 cursed for 3 blood frenzies.<br />
<br />
We did get 2 BoW from our first RZ though so that even things out kinda, and we got a shitload of BBB from Seru :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kurghann</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it s kinda obvious that DBoW is the must so far in one hand and the longer delay makes the riposte issue sorta kinda nothing to worry about anymore .<br />
 It seems that DBoW even with an ED a shiled a jiggly puff wand ( jagged staff )  or Quarm hammer or may be even a barbie doll holds aggro well ...<br />
my concern is since mr RZ drop rate is as bad as it was for bow , should i get EOE + A3 main hand or keep my SEWS+A3 till i get an DBoW ...  i ve always been concerned about ripostes and even tho i m brakin 11500 hp ish for 2200 + ac about , it still is something i m concerned about . <br />
May be it s just an old psychological side effect of our multiple wipes on AoW  years ago !!!  Us old farts of EQ should get some free  shrink sessions  !  hehehehe <br />
Lots telling me EOE ripostes did n t change much and isn t an issue , lots telling me it is so oh well... Lets forget DBoW for a minute cuz the delay is 35 and let s try and find out if faster weapons for main hand are worth it or are a good way to commit suicide with nasty oogly stuff riposting u for 3k + ...</div></div><hr />
