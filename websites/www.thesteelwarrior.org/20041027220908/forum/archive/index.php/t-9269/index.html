<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valnir Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm still wearing the haste cloak from EF hard and I've been looking for an upgrade.  What do people think about this cloak?  Theres no way I'm going to get a quarm ring but I have a really good chance at snagging this.  Is there a qvic+ cloak that I don't know about?  alternately is Eternal ward worth it?  Sorry if people in this forum don't want to answer this question but it seemed too trivial to ask in the overlords forum.</div></div><hr />

It's not bad.  I'd wait until you can get Inku'ta or Zun Cloak personally.  Better for tanking imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valnir Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thats what I wanted to hear, thanks for the advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Velle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You might want this just for the clicky effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valnir Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I considered that too... Is Eternal Ward _that_ good?  It seems pretty nice but I'm not totally sold.  But the cloak is a 110 hp upgrade that I could always bag again down the road.  I can't make a decision!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Eternal Ward is worth having unless you're already using an RZ ring or something that won't stack.  If you have no chance at the Quarm ring, but a good chance at this, I'd say grab it. For current usage you can always slap a Blood Ruby on it or any other easily acquired aug to fatten it up, 5% spellshield is nothing to sneeze at... and down the road when you've got something better than this/inktu'ta/zun cloaks all three, it will still continue to be useful as a clicky.<br />

In the long run, the longest lasting items are almost always clickies.</div></div><hr />
