<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 10:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all.  My guild and I have been doing regular Kael raids now for the last couple of weeks with the intention of upping our CoV faction and picking up some quest armor while we're at it.  So far we've pretty much stuck to the left arena and I have been pleasantly surprised with the frequency of the armor drops.  However, most of the drops have been of the enchanted silk variety (ie caster junk) or eroded leather.  Even had an enchanted robe drop last time, nice for our chanter, but doing nothing for me and the other tanks who are getting beat upon.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my question was this:  I've heard that the Plate House is so named for a tendency for more plate drops.  I've searched the boards for more detailed info on this but can't seem to find it.  Can someone please give me some more specific ideas what to expect there?  Such as, what level are the mobs, higher or lower than arena, how many and of what classes should we bring for such an adventure, and so on.  Are we just randomly seeing more of the other drops in the Arena, if so so should we just stick it out there?<br />
<br />
Thanks much</div></div><hr />

(No Rogues) <br />
<br />
<br />
I was told we didn't have enough or the forces to do it (Cleric was 60, Shaman was 63 and Enchanter was 62) I thought this was wierd but that is all i know a of now i don't even know where the house is but i got my Thurgy Gloves at right arena after 1 hour and by the time we stopped we had shammy chanter 60 Warrior Cleric and me and we were doing it easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
best strat is to offtank 1 H2H while MT and rest kill the other one...after he is dead the cycle goes on , always only 1 coming, always a little harder up to lvl 60 giant. at the end the drof comes running...kill it else you have to wait 3 hours to retrigger the cycle, then kill the offtanked giant.<br />
<br />
you need a slower, cleric, plate, plate, dps, dps.....maybe more dps.<br />
<br />
on the way in 62 sk gets all giants single. the room too comes single. the giants near to the end of the cycle have a huge regen. neither sk62 nor pally60 were able to do much damage while alone on the mob over several minutes.<br />
<br />
the event is a little buggy though at one moment we had 3 giants running around,...we were lucky and a 64 monk was with us so he offtanked that one ....in the end there were 2 cycles running the same time and 2 dead dorfs in the end....<br />
<br />
we did 4 cylces (including the double) and got 1 plate legs, 1 palte bracer, 1 plate arms.<br />
<br />
<br />
btw dorf head is later used in coldain ring 9.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrigan</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No faction hit for the dwarf, as he is a coldain traitor, and all of the traitors are on their own faction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
have spent alot of time in Kael, it's my impression that right side Arena has more plate drops, I saw 2 BP's drop (off PoZ's both times) in one 3 hour session, while on left side Arena, I have seen several leather and silk drops, but only one plate (leggings) ever<br />
<br />
think I will continue right side now, since the chances of plate dropping appear better, now, if only I could EVER win a dern random....LOL<br />
<br />
good luck all<br />

<br />
The area is actually a square and right and left are only different sides of the square.  Left can pull right and whatever, you can pull from inside and down the stairs, it doesnt really matter if the arena is &quot;open&quot; for the taking.</div></div><hr />
