Not imposible. but you have to start paying attention to server resets and ask around a bit to find out when one is going to pop.  Recently we were able to find the Servator of Luclin up in Greig's End and we had some fun taking him down.  <br />
<br />
My question, what are some mobs of comparable dificulty?  As in, since we took him down, what else can we deal with, also, what are the difrences between him and the mobs you recomend.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help,<br />
<br />
EDIT* oh yeah, also recently took out the terror matriarch in PoN.  So you can compare mobs to that if you want.  None of these guys realy needed a raid force, but just looking for mobs of equall or slightly harder dificutly because i think the two of them are about the same.</div></div><hr />

That might be all, I think, we did more but we teamed up with another guild for the rest I think. Most of this was pre-pop, so pop level mobs I can't speak for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Va Din, Lord BoB, Wuoshi, Telendor, Chardok Royals, for some examples.</div></div><hr />

He rarely drops his good loot, but his good loot is VERY nice for the RvR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oriestes</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, when I was ganking SoL, I was also taking out Vindi, first broods, rhags 1+2, statue, doomshade, rumblecrush, kunark dragons (sev is fun with 1 group at 3am), the three west ToV dragons (gozz/telk are easy, but LTK can be a long fight), I think that sums it up.<br />
<br />
 Rhag 1 is a very nice RvR for the required effort to kill him. Only needed 1 cleric to keep me alive and he died before defensive wore off.   <br />
<br />
Once you can get these guys down start thinking AoW and NToV, you'll have the gear to do it.</div></div><hr />
