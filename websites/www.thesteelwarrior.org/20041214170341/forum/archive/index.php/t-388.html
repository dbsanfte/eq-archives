<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just got a Blade of War last night (woohoo!) and I was wondering which AA I should go for to make it the most effective for myself, my exp. group, and my guild on raids.<br />
<br />
So far I have concentrated on getting nearly all of the defensive AAs (still don't have Innate Defense) and things that add hit points (about 90AA total so far).<br />
<br />
Which offensive AAs should I get to be the best warrior possible now that I have this thing?  Flurry... crits... ferocity + punishing blade... sooo many choices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say Punishing Blade first.  With PB you're giving yourself another possible attack, which is another possible proc also.  For me, even level 2 has helped greatly with dps and aggro.  I've heard Fero helps with attacks going off more often, which again is more aggro, but I don't have much first hand knowledge of it.  After that I'd go with flurry, since crits don't add any extra aggro (though you do need CF3 for flurry =\)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnimwit</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go with the AA's that add swings first then the ones that add flat damage (Fury of Ages, Tactical Master).<br />
<br />
I had Ferocity done before PB only because of the point cost differences, but doing either one first is fine. But if you tank at all I'd reccomend finishing ID. I did all my offensives long before finishing my defenses, and there was a very noticble change from one week to the next for my survivability durring the same encounters after I pounded out LR and ID.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is Ferocity equivalent or better or worse than Punishing Blade?  Looks like same description except PB is 2her only... and PB costs more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnimwit</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">By all indications PB works WITH ferocity. It adds attacks over and above what ferocity will give you. So if you score a natural single swing round, a succesfull ferocity roll gives you 2 attacks then on top of that you can score a successful PB and make it a triple attack round from a single attack round.<br />
<br />
The big question now is, will flurry proc off an unnatural triple thus giving you 5 swings in what was supposed to be a single swing round? It's hard to say for certain, but all the extra attacks add up for all the AA's spent. I'd still go with Ferocity first personally if I had it to do over again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalorn Iceblade</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Punishing Blade, Ferocity, CF3 (if not got), Flurry3, Raging Flurry 3.<br />
<br />
Its fun when you get a six hit round in with BoW - just make sure if you raiding and you not MT to not land a couple of said rounds before MT has plenty of agro - trust me you go splat real fast :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Woooooooohoooooooooooo !<br />
<br />
HULANTA is back ! And she's got a BoW !<br />
<br />
Feroity -) Punishing Blade -) Max Flurry -) Max Critic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinian</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I am working on Flurry now just for shits and giggles... I'll finish that last few levels of Ferocity afterwards.<br />
<br />
That would be pretty damn sweet if flurry could fire off Punishing Blade and Ferocity triples.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jysin</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recommend you forget all of this and finish up Defenses..lol. It makes that much difference, really! If you have a  BoW, I would really hope you are MT'ing. Those defenses would help out your group, raid, self, all you asked for the most. :D <br />
<br />
That said, I actually had Flurry6 before Ferocity and I can without a doubt say that Ferocity feeds into more Flurry procs. I dont even have to parse to tell you that. I would follow the suggested AA path others have said though because Flurry is such a large buy-in. There are other more effecient ways of increasing DPS first.<br />
<br />
PB &gt; Ferocity &gt; Flurry &gt; Crits = can of whoopass!! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I am MTing often.  I am often the Main Assist while we grind to our target and we have about 5 warriors who normally do the MTing once we get there.<br />
<br />
I can certainly grind out ID and the last point of LR in the next couple of weeks.  I just really love having an offensive and effective taunting weapon all in one and wanted to maximize it.<br />
<br />
The coolest thing about the BoW is that you can use it when you aren't tanking as long as the person tanking has good agro when they start.  It is really cool to see myself proccing the EB and not drawing the agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinian</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spending points in offensive AA before fully maximizing all defensive AA is inefficient ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TaiilChayser</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">but most of the time Fun &gt; Efficiancy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feiddas</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get your defensive aa first, your not a rogue your a tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah -- I said I would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fironis</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 02:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stop posting and start grinding the aa hoops!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't grind anything at work!  Leave me alone Oversmurf!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah, if you spend AA on offensive AA you get AA faster thereby getting the defensive AA :)  I know that after I got my BoW I quickly got PB and Ferocity and THEN finished off the last two Innate Defenses.  Now that that's done, I'm probably going to go for the two Flurry AAs...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 06:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your argument intrigues me... hmm... maybe I will go offensive first!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korak Sarathai</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 07:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know Hulanta, I only have PB1... but it feels DAMN GOOD to quad a mob with a 2hander :)  Do what is fun.  It is a game after all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">05-03-2003, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You need to look at what your charater is doing.  Are you xping? Are you mting? Each defensive aa helps a little bit in taking damage but each offensive aa helps keep/grab aggro.  Now that I have all my offensive aa maxed, unless someone is being a dip shet, I can hold aggro well in any xp group and I can hold aggro well after they realize that chain casting ensnare/life tap/(fill in hybred penis enlarging spell here) multiple times will indeed gank aggro... they stop.<br />
<br />
That said, getting flurry/pb does do a few things... I missed 11 times in a row with my obsidian great blade and still kept aggro in a pov xp group.  Turing and getting can not see target 6 times but only was at that angle for a second....<br />
<br />
Any way, doing more dps is fun but taking damage is our job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">05-03-2003, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Update:  LR 4!  ID 0...<br />
<br />
I think after I finish LR 5, I will switch to get PB 2 &amp; 3, then go back and do ID 1-5, then start going bonkers with Offense</div></div><hr />
