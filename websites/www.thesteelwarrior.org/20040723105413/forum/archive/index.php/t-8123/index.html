<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>saint28</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just recently got a FB and was curious what u guys think would be better arggo in the offhand, JoS or EoE. EoE was always great arggo imho, but the stats are really nice on the JoS. Arggo wise I am curious which would be a better choice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Whatever you can get your hands on,  EoE might be slightly more but even thats debatble, get whatever one you can, and aug it with a3 and should be fine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>saint28</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have EoE and JoS both atm and both are A3 augged, was wondering which would be better in that comparison</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The two weapons are close enough when it comes aggro.  I think JoS has more AC?  Certainly JoS has better stats overall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Midasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have both and end up switching off a lot.  With the JOS I have about 20 more hp and 5 more AC.  /shrug<br />
<br />
I use the JOS most of the time, but I haven't quite figured it out yet but it seems like some mobs get more pissed off at the speed of the EOE, and it does seem to proc more often.  I use EOE a lot vs. casting mobs, and when I'm lagging more.  But I don't do studies or anything, just go by instinct, and what seems to work at the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">EoE is better aggro than JoS (but not that much). But JoS's hate is much more tight to its DPS.<br />
Thus my suggestion would be do equipe EoE main when you plan to make a long fight (tipically as a Raid MT) and to eqquipe JoS main when you face mob with few HP (tipically exp group). Like this you will built up over time the more aggro when EoE is mainhanded, and you will get a faster early aggro to let the slow land sooner, etc ... when JoS is mainhanded.<br />
<br />
have fun,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Midasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oh, rofl, i have DBoTW in main, and switch JOS/EOE in offhand.  Sorry for confusion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would go with the JoS, better stats. Close to the same ammount of agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i usually use JoS offhand for the dps and EoE offhand for the neat stun proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Decaillin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I usually use JoS offhand, and swap EoE in when fighting caster mobs...The aggro difference between JoS/EoE is pretty small (EoE is slightly better imo), but you cant go wrong with either one, especially if auged with Anger 3.<br />
<br />
Since you have Anger 3 on both, i'd suggest using JoS, for the better ratio/stats</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">From my experience, an unauged JoS has better agro than an Anger3 auged EoE offhand. Aug the JoS and there's no competition provided there isn't a primary hand proc frenzy.</div></div><hr />
