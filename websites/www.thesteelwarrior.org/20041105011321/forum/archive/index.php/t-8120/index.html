<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>texreb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK have been playing EQ about 2 or so weeks am a level 8 human warrior have some decent armor I think someone gave it to me. Need a decent weapon I can attain. Any suggestions. Further can anyone tell me where new warriors can go for info on stuff related to them. I have looked for a bit here and no offense but most if not all (of what I could find) played out to Higher levels. Thanks for your time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the quested armor is good. final test is a weapon.<br />
<br />
10plat should get you a great weapon at lvl 8 from the bazaar.<br />
<br />
you can get xp and collect tradeskill items to sell from lions, bears,spiders, ect.. for plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cuthbadth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Library will probably contain more useful information than current threads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Takata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Allakhazam.com is a good site for newbies to start looking up info, they got entier beastry list of zones, quests, item lists and more. At lvl 8 I'd keep working on your newbie quest armor. You'll most likely finnish it around lvl 12 or 13. Keep at least one plat on you. Heres a hint, try and find mobs that carry weapons, usually at your level decaying skeletons will have weapons. Rusty weapons won't sell for much but if you find one with a wood staff that can sell for 1pp. Keep that 1plat and buy a trade stachel. Then start farming stuff like spider silks and skin pelts and put them in your stachel and sell them in the bazaar. Try and collect stacks of them and sell for like 5plat each, you'll make about 100pp per stack. Here's another hint, if you have pop expansion use the books and go to odus in Toxx forest,  where the erudites live, its usually always quite there. Kill kobolds there they drop very good loot, sometimes bags so if you don't have alot of bags yet you won't need to buy any if you hunt there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Agreed with the previous posts.  The newbie quests usually top out at level 15/ if you do them without assistance and are untwinked.  Do them.  They are great XP and they guide you to the best places to XP at each level.  As you get toward level 20, the amount of money that you earn from monsters will jump a lot, and you'll be able to start buying gear in the bazaar for your non-visible equipment slots and weapons, items that cost a couple of platinum each.  At level 20, or earlier if you have friends, you can begin working on crafted armor quests.  This set of quests will take you through to level 35 if you do the entire armor set, and will take you to places that are appropriate for earning XP.  As you level from 20-30 your income will soar as mobs start dropping platinum pieces, and you'll be able to buy better equipment in the bazaar to replace the gear/weapons you obtained at levels 1-20.  This equipment progression can take you smoothly to level 40 or 45 without requiring the charity of others.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The library refers to the one on our boards =)<br />
<br />
Farm the silks and pelts hides will make you a lot of money, and you'll easily be able to upgrade yourself over time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>iasmin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The Library will probably contain more useful information than current threads.<br />
<br />
At the risk of a potential thread hijacking, I think I'd have to disagree with this. I've been frequenting the boards for quite some time (though only recently signed an account here) and I've found it quite frustrating to find information in the library that helps the truly new Warrior. Those pieces of information that would be really useful are buried at the end or have been edited out because they are out of date. What I wish for is a sticky at the top that gives the newest Warriors an idea of where to begin. <br />
<br />
Some of the sheer detail of information on these boards is astounding, but of incredibly little use to the new Warrior who wants to know about how to learn to be a better puller or learn how to work with other classes. or even information on the philosophy of being a Warrior in the game. Having a single location where someone can go and read &quot;Hey, are you new? Here's a link about your armour and here's a link about your weapons and here's a link about....&quot; can only help out the new Warriors in the game and keep them from suffering through the &quot;search is your friend&quot; answers when search is *not* their friend and definitely not going to provide them with a good place to start, which is, of course, the beginning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>XAclylospradaX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Qeynos, there is a npc(around the arena/warrior guildmaster area) that will give you info on how to quest yourself a fine set of Battlemaster's armor!<br />
<br />
Freeport, at the balcony above the arena there is a npc where you can quest yourself a AWESOME suit of Steel Warrior's armor.<br />
<br />
Both quests are like other posters have said, based around the low lvl zones that sorround those 2 cities.<br />
<br />
After you work on those find a nice place to lvl up, but eventually make your way to South Karana. Find the Centaur village and run into the npc that will tell you about the Crated Armor quest. A quest that will test your might and wits in zones that could cause a unwarrented demise! Anyhow, it's a fun quest...if you're not planning on being pl'd and twinked out and want to see some of the things that many of *US* went through in the early stages of our warriors life, then I recomend it. :)<br />
<br />
You can meet some people that you will probably never forget in this game along the way also, people that will most likely go out of their way to lend you a hand. Things like this make Everquest a great adventure.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">the Crated Armor quest. A quest that will test your might and wits in zones that could cause a unwarrented demise!  <br />
<br />
Granted, there might be cheaper armor in the bazaar,  But theres a feeling of pride that comes with a full set of Earned Crafted armor that you just can't put a price on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have to agree with iasmin's post.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I'm not sure I'm qualified to talk about how to play a new warrior; the last time I had a warrior at lvl 8, Barbarians anyway didn't have a newbie armor quest and you could get a group together to go hunt bandits in West K for their sashes. Not sure you could do that now. <br />
It used to be that 100 people would be in South K., heh. <br />
<br />
Texreb, if you are in Qeynos, go to Blackburrow; I believe that you can still find folks fighting there. If you are in Freeport, you'll soon be able to get orc and dervish camps--a few months ago there were still enough people hunting in the commons &amp; Northern desert of Ro/oasis that getting a group there was possible.<br />
<br />
And, if you can find hunting partners, I'd hunt in those zones. Because, really, if you grow up in Qeynos you should know what the elite ledge in Blackburrow is; if you grow up in Freeport, you should spend at least a day or two at the Orc Highway. <br />
<br />
The newbie armor quests are good, and I'd do them. You'll find that the drops for some of the stuff you need are potentially frustrating to find, but do as much of it as you can stand.<br />
<br />
I seriously doubt you'll be able to get groups together to help you do much of the crafted quests, but some parts are easier than others (bracers, for example). Again, I'd do what I could on these quests.<br />
<br />
You might also look at http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/news_page.php<br />
That site is an excellent source for info on tradeskills. In general, tradeskilling is not very efficient (costs you more plat than it's worth) but two might be interesting to look into: fletching and fishing. fishing actually pays for itself in fairly short order, though it's a low-return activity. Fletching costs some money, but almost right away you can make arrows that are better than what you can buy for the same amount of plat. (If you hunt in Blackburrow, you should be able to loot a very low-level bow and some arrows from the gnolls there, by the way).<br />
<br />
As you problably already know, there are a good many details in this game, heh. they cannot all be explained in a single post. I'd very much encourage you to ask questions here as you go along. Try using search, of course, but if nothing turns up, post your question and someone around here will try to help.</div></div><hr />

Here at tSW; since it's beginnings back on EzBoard; we've ( fortunately and unfortunately ) have always been more focused on higher end stuff rather than newbie stuff. Hopefully down the road we'll be able to compile more new warrior stuff but mostly what the old timers know is dated at most ( like find a newb who collects GLS' to hand in to go buy a combine weapon or ones who go to SolA/Highkeep for their uber bronze armor :D )<br />
<br />
Hopefully with the influx of new players ( they really do exist !! :D ) and their sharing of the knowledge our database can grow. <br />
<br />
But for the most part ( back on topic ); what the others here said is sound advice at most. Especialy with the inception of the Bazaar; one can make a rather lucrative business seling drops that critters you kill give decent experience for; and to learn to save up/hunt for new gear. Sure; back pre-kunark most people paid in blood for their upgrades; but now with the bazaar; one can use their minds to accomplish the same goals and IMO it's a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sure; back pre-kunark most people paid in blood for their upgrades; <br />
<br />
Damn yes !! I think some scars will bleed forever !! I swore once to make a genocide on all gnolls of EQ ....<br />
But they are repopping too fast to do it by myself :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>iasmin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Here at tSW; since it's beginnings back on EzBoard; we've ( fortunately and unfortunately ) have always been more focused on higher end stuff rather than newbie stuff.

<br />
Well maybe with a little encouragement, some of the newer players or the not-so-new but new to Warriors players will be willing to post their questions or assist in seeking out answers. From a personal standpoint, level 8 was hell for me (just to get the thread back on topic). My main is a shaman and the concept of a warrior was a very foreign one to me. Technically, I've &quot;twinked&quot; my warrior with the armour made by a friend's blacksmith skilling through some armour combines, so I never had the benefit of going through some of the early Ogre Warrior armour quests because I never really needed it.<br />
<br />
I think what I might do is start another thread on the topic of things every young warrior should know. For now, real life work calls and if I read the boards too long being engrossed by the mechanics of raid work (I'm not near that level but the detail is fascinating), then it's likely my boss will come in and catch me. It would only go badly from there. :)</div></div><hr />

im 65 and am still waiting for my income to soar  :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't look at the bazaar for every peice of gear honestly, although there is a fast easy way to gear up if you got that plat, but questing items regardless how small and if it's even a marginal upgrade gives a nice feeling when looking at your equipment. <br />
<br />
Or...you can just play the bazaar, if your good at it expect to make alot of pp.<br />
<br />
It's really how you want to advance, view, and play the game. There is lvl 65's who lvl'd up all in ldon in under 3 months, and  have not even been to &quot;old-world&quot; zones. <br />
<br />
<br />
Mistmoore for example  has a beautiful setting on it's own as do alot of places where from 15-50. I'm happy they have added &quot;hot spots&quot; into the game, although they should announce and make them more know.</div></div><hr />

Heres a forum for good armor to get as you climb.  If there was only something similar for weapons...<br />
<br />
Heres a new to warrior and relativly new to the game player chiming in<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Apokolipse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If you have the opportunity to leave your account on all night in trader mode you can make unbelievable amounts of plat in the bazaar.  <br />
<br />
I've always made a point of putting my trader up each night when I log my warrior and some nights if I couldn't find a group I would sit in the bazaar and watch the prices like a stock market.  Buy low and sell high, I've made hundreds of thousands of plat just doing that in the bazaar.  Enjoy the time to play when you can, and let your mule earn your plat while you sleep.<br />
<br />
Before you sell things to merchants to make room, price them in the bazaar you might make much more from higher level toons that need that item for a quest and would rather buy it than loot it.<br />
<br />
I made an enchanter with high charisma for my mule, when I do loot things to sell to merchants, I put them in the shared slot and then have my &quot;pretty boy&quot; enchanter sell them as he gets twice as much as my &quot;ugly&quot; ogre does.<br />
<br />
just my 2 cents...<br />
<br />
Good Luck and Enjoy <br />
