<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Updates are coming to the Breakdown in Communication quest soon. Remember that until it's live it isn't set in stone, but Rashere doesn't anticipate any changes.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to give a head's up on these changes since they came up at the summit. This is currently on test and should go live with the next patch. This is just related to BiC quest drops, not other loot on the NPCs.<br />
<br />
The Qinimi and Barindu events now drop 3 pieces, rather than just 1. The Barindu event was lowered to a 24 hour-ish respawn.<br />
<br />
Sewer rares now drop their piece 100% of the time. The difficulty will be just in finding and killing the rares now.<br />
<br />
The cragbeast and kyv bosses in Tipt now drop their piece 100% of the time.<br />
<br />
Drop rates in Vxed were increased.<br />
<br />
The Primals and Mindrider in Yxtta will now drop their page 100% of the time. In addition, their pages are available off basepop as well, albiet at a much lower rate, to allow a single group path to this part.<br />
<br />
