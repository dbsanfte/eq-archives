I really wonder what will happen to this thing ...<br />
<br />
with it, we can possibly equip two shield ! one in secondary and this one in primary !!!! well it would be hard to keep aggro without weapon but for sure it would really define the 'turtle mode'.<br />
<br />
Originally, SKs were the king of hate/aggro, I wonder if some would try a full aggro SK protected be a double-shielded warrior using '/shield' on him... I bet it would be a waste of mana since you have to heal more people but still it would be amusing to see it happen once ... <br />
<br />
SoE's solution for knight's mitigation issue : equip them with a double-shielded warrior :D<br />
<br />
<br />
need a screenshoot of this happening.</div></div><hr />

It is my belief they miscoded the ac number on the eye. I think it might of meant to be 35 ac. It could always be meant to be 135, but that is a bit crazy because some planar stuff aint that good, but it is from the new revamped VP, so who knows.</div></div><hr />

No way that it's supposed to have that much AC.  Probably not supposed to be mainhanded either, but who knows.  With this thing in your magelo you could be the ultimate Eqrankings whore though.</div></div><hr />
