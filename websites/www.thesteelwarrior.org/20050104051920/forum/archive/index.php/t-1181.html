<br />
Here's today's question : I am actually wearring a RBG, but I also own a heavy rubicite girdle.<br />
<br />
I am the main tank of our guild, and I was wondering if it is worth it to lose the RBG haste for the upgrade in terms of AC and HPs the rubi offers ?<br />
<br />
Here's my current magelo : http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=422216<br />
<br />
Thanks for your input,<br />

<br />
Of course it's a serious question ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazthet</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok nm my question, I found another thread about it :D<br />
Guess that was why you were asking that ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it isn't too silly a question..<br />
<br />
But I think if everyone else than the MT has got haste items, you';re gonna find it really hard to keep aggro :)<br />
<br />
Besides the bonuses you get from the admittedly very nice Rubicite Girdle, are not likely to make any difference in your MT job.. there's always gonna be another buff somewhere that could cater for it..<br />
<br />
Hell, I'd love to have that Rubicite Girdle.. <br />
<br />
Try to get a haste item that's not on the belt slot and then yo ucan equip that Rubicite belt.<br />
<br />
What you may have asked.. which is not so easy to answer for me.. is would it be worth switching to the SCHW's haste and equip that belt ?<br />
<br />
It may have been what you meant but wasn;'t clear at all from your post it read as if you were gonna go either rubicite or haste..<br />
<br />
SCHW's are the easiest haste you can get on another slot I am guessing.. but the Haste percent is probably less than RBG.. (22 to 34 ? not sure)<br />
<br />
Personally, I wouldnt go for a lower Haste item EVER. We have enough problems keeping aggro as it is.. even with attack call, I would keep that RBG until I get a uber cloak or something ^_^</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenakha</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haste &gt; all for a warrior, your primary means of holding agro is through damage, procs are a nice boost but even with enraging blow procs your primary agro comes through damage.  Haste is your best way of raising your damage.  IE haste is the single best thing you can do to increase your ability to do your job.  No haste is NEVER an option.  This is stuff you learn well before you become the MT of well any guild hence why I think this poster is trolling.</div></div><hr />
