<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xrotch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey Wars<br />
I just recently started playing EQ. My roomate in college allways played and tried to get me hooked many times over the past few years but i saw his addiction and realsied with my course work i would not have time for it. But now i graduated and am work and have more time. so i bought eq and rolled up my first character. i chose a dwarf war. why well why not i dont think i need to explain my chocie here. <br />
But anyway i made a coupla friends real fast in the field of bone My old roomate told me to go strait there and work on lvls. well between there and messin in Padual caverns i managed to hit 29. it turns out all those people i met all have higher lvl characters and are not on the bards or shamans anymore. and i am stuck as for ideas as to where to go to look for groups. i checked out dawnshroud peaks last night and those wolves hit like mack trucks. <br />
<br />
I play on the luclin server if that matters at all. Also where is a good place or way to start making plat. i need to start looking into getting myself some gear. I must say the bazaar is amazing place to druel . <br />
anyway hope this is the right forum for this. and thanks for your help.<br />
thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Level 29, hmmm, well there are a number of places you can try.  Lake of Ill Omen still gives decent experience for a few more levels.  Frontier Mountains just next door to LOIO is someplace to go.  You could try Iceclad in Velious, if I recall right the cougars are about the right level or maybe just a little too high.  I also liked the lizard men outside Temple of Cazic Thule although getting singles isn't easy.  And there is always South Karana at the aviak village, still some exp there.  Also Splitpaw near the entrance.  Oh, and I really liked Gunthak in LoY, in fact I'd probably recommend you try there first, probably the best place.<br />
<br />
Thing is though, you're going to be in bad shape unless you can find at least a healer to team with.  Soloing is going to be a serious struggle.  And frankly I just can't suggest anywhere in the level 29 area where getting a group is going to be easy, there just aren't that many new players in the game and the players who've been playing a while tend to PL a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah; around level 28 or so is where the soloing ends for a warrior unless heavily twinked.<br />
your best bet is to try to stick it out with your friends you made; and zones like DSP; even Great divide hunting the tizmaks and maybe wolves in your early 30's is okay to do as well.<br />
<br />
But; at this stage of EQ; i'd go as far to say that 75% of the people you meet and hunt with at your level are going to be alts of higher level char's; and better equipped to boot. Good luck though and enjoy the game.</div></div><hr />
