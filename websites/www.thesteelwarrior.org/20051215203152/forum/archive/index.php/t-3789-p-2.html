I really hope that you can follow this up with more tests to get a solid estimate on aggro per swing based on damage rating and damage bonus.  One useful formula you could derive next would be aggro per second:<br />
<br />
Aggro per second = <br />
(Aggro per swing / swings per second)  +  (Aggro per proc / seconds per proc)<br />
<br />
<br />
Note that seconds per proc is roughly 30 for most main hand weapons.  I'm not sure of the off-hand proc rates off the top of my head, but they too are fairly constant.  Odds are the maximum normal damage/5 is a damage procs aggro, plus any stun aggro.<br />
<br />
Hypothetically, using the damage bonus + damage estimate for two handers and 1.25*damage + damage bonus for one-handers, for instance, at 65th level all one handed weapons would do about 1.25*damage + 13 aggro per swing.  So, estimating +10 delay = +one second between  swings, aggro per second would be roughly (1.25*dam +13) * 10 / Delay.   For a two-hander, it would be (dam + dam bonus) * 10 / Delay.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll be very interested to see some follow-up numbers to see how this all pans out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yeah, I bet 5 swings for pulling with a tot and one more ToT.  Because the hate generated would be damage bonus + damage or 132 + 45 = 177 per attack.  725/177 = 4.1 which you have to round up to 5.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Playing with the numbers a bit, the formula DB + 11 * MINIMUM seems to be a reasonable fit for all types of weapons. Sounds like the kind of thing someone might have hacked in as a guess of average weapon damage (11 is close to the average of a 1 to 20 roll).<br />
<br />
MINIMUM is the minimum possible damage for the weapon ignoring damage bonuses, i.e. RND(DAM/10), so 2 for a 15 dam weapon. <br />
<br />
dam      delay      DB@65    MIN      DB+11*MIN<br />
12	50          51           1          62<br />
40	36          39           4          83<br />
22	50          51           2          73<br />
8	20          13           1          24<br />
8	20          0            1          11<br />
28	28          13           3          46<br />
28	28          0            3          33<br />
<br />
<br />
If this theory is right, a 15/20 offhand should get aggro exactly twice as fast as a 14/20. Should be easy to test, if someone has the weapons.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will have to test that.  I got a bunch of new weapons to test out.  I was starting to test them on guard brendyl in NRo who had massive regen.  <br />
<br />
After setting up my baseline the zone went down and when I came back Guard Brendyl didn't regen any more.  I guess he must have been bugged or something.  heh</div></div><hr />

There are some iffy things about theory #1 &quot;Misses give as much hate as hits&quot;.  Try repeating the test with two players, both wielding the same weapon, but both with the different weapon skills.  My intuition wants me to believe the one with the higher skill will end up with aggro after the same number of swings (assuming the more skilled combatant will land more of them.)  Maybe test it that way? <br />
<br />
You could also use some combination of (ferine) avatar or other raw atk buffs, str buffs, whatever to have the same person have a different chance to hit.<br />
<br />

It has also been shown that Terror spells give wacky amounts of aggro at range.  some claim that they dont work at range at all.  another thing to consider.  <br />
<br />
Terrors give LESS aggro than listed if they are the only aggro events, but since Brodda kept the numbers of terrors constant across tests he's comparing, it doesn't matter what the absolute hate is, except for calculating the numbers.<br />
<br />
Very interesting test. I'm not sure I quite understand how one might go about expanding on this.</div></div><hr />

This is pretty interesting.  So I would not be wrong in saying melee DPS has no effect on aggro?<br />
<br />
Edit: regarding ATK buffs, I thought they ATK buffs did not increase chance to hit, rather give you bigger hit numbers?  Thats another discussion... lol</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kraydak</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 01:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If Kaledan's theory is correct, it suggests a way to help with our agro as compared to casters.  The formula given was a reasonable approximation of the damage per swing pre-Kunark, but since, with the improvement in damage tables, skill caps, raw attack, str etc... it *drastically* underestimates damage.  Accordingly our melee agro per melee damage ratio has fallen dramatically.  As a lvl 65 warrior w/GSo4W and no worn attack I'd estimate my average damage being min*30+DB rather than min*11+DB.  Using the min*30 formula would literally double my melee agro generation.<br />
<br />
Being more realistic, if the formula holds, then as a rule of thumb melee agro per melee damage (which we might as well call APD, and as warriors want to maximise) is highest for 28+ delay 2handers, followed by dual wielding followed by delay 27- 2handers.  VERY slow and VERY fast 1 handers violate this, as might VERY slow 2handers.  The DBotW, for example, would absolutely SUCK at melee agro generation for a weapon of it caliber at 57 agro/35 delay on Kaledan's scale or well under a 2 to 1 ratio, worse than,  say, 35/20 for a BoC.  A GSo4W would do much better at 80/31, and while that discounts an offhand, even an EoE would only have a 22/20 offhanded, and assuming your offhand fired as often as your main (hah) DBotW+EoE would have all but the same melee agro generation as a GSo4W.</div></div><hr />

I spent a deal of time raising my skill from approx 20 to 250 with the same weapon (which had no proc upon it). Purely from observation (which could admittedly be flawed) I didn't see a noticeable difference in my ability to hold aggro at either end of the skill spectrum.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they were ignored, then some portion of the damage potential is agro free which could be useful to know for non-tanking classes like rogues.<br />
<br />
There is some anecdotal information that says they are possibly ignored, since every Main tank I have ever heard of for Ssra Emperor has ignored bane weapons and just used their normal hate procs.<br />
<br />
If they are not ignored, what position might they have in the formula?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great stuff, and has one interesting implication:<br />
<br />
If the stylized aggro algorithm is <br />
<br />
aggro = hate + bonus<br />
<br />
and if part of the bonus value is &quot;is the current target&quot;<br />
<br />
and if mobs can have different values for &quot;is the current target&quot;<br />
<br />
running these tests on mobs could help us evaluate the relative &quot;stickiness&quot; of mob targeting. That is, some mobs might switch targets more easily than other mobs, by adjusting the value they give to the &quot;current target&quot; part of the bonus side of their aggro algorithm.<br />
<br />
Does that make sense?<br />
<br />
I think undead just have a low &quot;stickiness&quot; value, hence their sensitivity to proximity aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will have to second that observation.  When I first received my GSo4W, my 2hb skill was extremely low.  I'm talking like 30's.  Yet, I was still able to hold agro just fine and even one of my guild officers commented how well I held agro, despite having ~80 skill by the time he said that (Skills go up fast, hehe).  <br />
<br />
I wonder how backstab is calculated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Procs are one big random factor.  Another is the taunt skill check, which may or may not work on a given attempt.  Both of these factors alone can cause ping pong within melee groups.  Likewise, people who use feign or evade to reduce aggro don't always succeed.<br />
<br />
Proximity to the mob is another factor that can change from fight to fight.</div></div><hr />
