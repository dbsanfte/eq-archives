<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilicontus</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all, this is my first post in here, must say it's fun reading all the stuff in the library and the arcade rocks hehe  :D <br />
<br />
Now, to the main topic. I have MTed Paffa during a raid, and I must say, I am still uncertain on the exact timing on the last wave.<br />
<br />
The strategy that we used was this:<br />
After the 3 waves are down, and Paffa is targetable, there will be MT, RT, off-tanks and mezzer to handle the situation. DPS will focus on Paffa. <br />
<br />
Now the problem is, during my MTing session, I was practically mobed by all the spawns. This raised the concern, on when I should send in the crowd control, and RT. If I send in mezzer too early, splat. If I send in off-tanks too early, they might aggro Paffa and get rampage. <br />
<br />
Any thoughts on this would be appreciated. Thank you.</div></div><hr />

It can get messy until they are all under control though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Devastate</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 07:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">me and my friends do paffa with 5, or did, we got 2 masks and the necro earring and were finished.<br />
<br />
Cleric, enchanter, necro, war, then either druid or bard or shaman, whatever we could pick up<br />
<br />
<br />
Enchanter and necro get CoD pets, kill 3 waves, engage<br />
<br />
Turn paffas back to the pets, haste them both, and 70% of the time he will be dead before next pop.<br />
<br />
If they popped, we would have the druid or shaman AE Snare / Slow to get aggro, and run to zone to buy time to finish, if they didnt come all at once due to bad timing of some other spell, cast it again, huge aggro.<br />
<br />
In my experience it was around 45 seconds  - 1 min after engaging.</div></div><hr />

Then everyone goes in and owns Paffa takes hardly no time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the waves arent exactly hard so i wouldnt bother doing stuff like training them to zone. when we used to do paffa a caster would usually be sitting and get aggro on the last wave so they wouldnt mob tank (ps tanking paffa sucks as he has some weird stun)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fafnir</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 11:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stand right up near Paffa.  When he becomes targetable and the wave spawns, pop on Furious (100% riposte) and take a couple of steps backwards.  All mobs are being on you but you take no damage.  At that time, the CC and others engage.  A few of the puslings will be locked down by the CC team when furious drops, then click evasive and away you go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bashiae</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think your tactic(s) will rely heavily on your force at the raid.  As I recall, when Paffa pops targettable (third wave, or fourth?) it's exactly as a final wave of adds spawn around him.  I always had my raid force stand far back against the wall outside of his room (in the first room there where you can see his torso basically) just prior to targettable Paffa/wave popped, and I'd have a second and third tank assigned beforehand for the purpose.<br />
<br />
Being the MT, we'd split the mobs prior so that my mob was dead well before final wave/Paffa targetable, then there's a couple options.  Then I'd do as Fafnir stated (without riposte, since this was before multiple discs) and plunk the closest pusling pop, which would *usually* bring 2 or 3 of them (sometimes just 1 too, depending how you pull - try not to run too close to paffa or he'll smack you a few times and make you require a heal).<br />
<br />
As soon as those first few mobs are out, you will then have agro on Paffa, and immediately instruct your second (and third, if applicable) tanks (rampage tank(s)) to run up and shoot and arrow/cast on Paffa.  This will almost always agro the final mob(s) in his room; then they can bring them down to the rest of the raid.<br />
<br />
At this point our tactics varied as we experimented, but with a raid of about 18 people most of the time (one CoD pet), we found the most efficient tactic was to kill TWO of these first puslings (since they can pretty much be killed before the final pusling pull is locked down by your Enchanter/bard/what not.)<br />
<br />
During this time of fighting the first few puslings, since you have already established the Rampage tank (will be either your only second tank who pulled, or perhaps the third tank if you chose to use one; only really required if you want to take less risk and *may* lose someone during the fight), have debuffers do their thing on Paffa.  Then when MT is ready to charge, give the call, run in disc/AE Taunt, and go to town.  Suggest that you stick your back to the back wall so any pets you have will be attacking from the backside.  This also forces your healers/casters to move into the room slightly to keep things spread out for your CC to keep things under control.<br />
<br />
That's about it.  You may or may not see a second wave spawn depending on your DPS, but if so, remember they will almost always go straight for the MT right off (or whoever has agro from Paffa the instant they pop) so make sure he has spam heals ready.  However, due to the risk of agroing 4 puslings on a single healer, I reccomend using another Warrior if available to AE taunt the adds off the healer/whoever gets subsequent agro from the spawns.  This Warrior can then /disc furious if necessary to allow time for lockdown.  I DO NOT suggest you fight any of these mobs.  It's a waste of time and resources and increases your risk greatly - they will despawn when Paffa dies, so why bother.  You shouldn't have trouble burning him down after 50% health anyway, since he's stationary and all.<br />
<br />
Have fun and good luck!<br />
