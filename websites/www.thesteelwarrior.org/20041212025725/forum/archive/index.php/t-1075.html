Here are my ideas, this would help us greatly do our jobs but not become game gbreaking or trivialize encounters imo....<br />
 Maybe we can come up with something constructive and feasable to propose to the developers to fix what more than just warriors see as a 'problem'<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1. HP's - All mana on gear is hp's to a warrior <br />
--OR--<br />
HP's - Warriors get a 25% premium on hp items.<br />
<br />
3. AC - give us the monk mitigation chart... LOL, seriouslly we need our own damage table. Perhaps if the DB of a mob was always 50% for a warrior? This sounds like a very easy fix to implement<br />
<br />
4. Taunt - Give me a fail/success message. At least the impression that this works would comfort warriors egos.<br />
<br />
5. Taunt - Give me a range, It is kind of silly that I can be in melee range and NOT in taunt range. Taunt needs a range that scales up with skill? Maybe range equal to skill?<br />
<br />
6. Taunt give us real seperation in taunt skill. Cap it at 255 or 305.<br />
<br />
Any comments? opinions?</div></div><hr />

We get some really cool /discs....how many do we get to use? ONE.   We have to keep /disc defensive up 'cause we never know when we'll need it.<br />
<br />
OK. /steps off his soapbox.<br />
The 50% decrease on mob DB might be a little much to ask for, but we definitely need a permanent increase in our mitigation above and beyond /disc defensive.  Also, if they took away the offense penalty for defensive that would be just peachy too.<br />
Overall, I like these ideas, and would like to see some or all of them implemented.  Lot's of good ideas on this board, nobody but us warriors seem to care about them.<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />

I really, truly, completely feel sorry for those who have chosen warriors for their mains. As the one who typically chooses the tank in a grind group, I know I'll always pick a knight over a warrior and that really bothers me.<br />
<br />
I /feedback every single day that warriors should be fixed. So have faith! You have some allies in the other class communities!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh, unhooking timers would be nice, but the complications...<br />
need to only have one at a time, stacking.. etc...<br />
<br />
<br />
hmmm a  few nice stacks...<br />
<br />
Charge!, Mightystrike!<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
Furious! MightyStrike!<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
Evasive! Defensive! <br />
<br />
if we had aggro lock would make tanking almost trivial<br />
<br />
If I unhooked disc, <br />
<br />
i would just make them 'spells' put them in a 'book of tactics', allow us to prepare our disciplines for the day in the spell gems, just like bards do songs, give them seperate refresh timers, make them sit in their own buff slot (slot 21) , and have them all overwrite each other, to prevent any stacking issues...<br />
<br />
But then imagine how this would change tanking tactics......<br />
<br />
Start grab agro with a real taunt ability... <br />
Fortitude till slowed, <br />
go defensive for 3 minutes, <br />
evasive for 3.. <br />
mob almost dead now, <br />
do a mightystrike followed by a fellstrike and a furious to finish off the mob...<br />
<br />
Wow, that might almost make us the 'Masters of Combat!' we would actually be usefull for more than 3 minutes in a boss mob  fight..<br />
<br />
<br />
The same could be done for rogues and monks, especially monks with all their silly stuff they do. <br />
<br />
ever notice how casters get so much more flexibility with spell gems and hotkeys?</div></div><hr />

What I really meant was that nobody at SOE cares, but it's good to know we have some allies in our battle.  Sort of makes sense that warriors and clerics stick together. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dranth</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is more of just a convenience thing then a fix and something that really should be available to all melee if not everyone, but with the upcoming changes to the way casters can memorize spells, I would like to see something similar put in for melee.<br />
<br />
Be able to save armor/weapon configurations for various situations and just load them up by clicking on a hotkey or two.  Better then digging through a bunch of bags.<br />
<br />
As for fixes, I would love to see a success/fail taunt message and at least something done with the discs.  I am and have been 65 for a while now… been playing the game for a long time and I can think of once I have used any disc other then evasive/defensive (other then when I first got them to see what they did).  That is just kinda sad.<br />
<br />
Increased range on taunt is a good one also.<br />
<br />
Separate mitigation table is of course one that I have seen thrown around on these boards for a LONG time now and one I hope SoE takes a close look at.  It would go a long way to alleviate many of the disparities I have seen in the game.<br />
<br />
I would also like to see them go back and maybe alter a few of the more… shall we say… under used AA abilities.  Make warcry something a bit more useful… something along the lines of for the duration all negative effects from spells/AoE/special abilities are ignored by everyone in range (they may still land on you, but while warcry is up they get treated as they don’t exist).<br />
<br />
Anyway, there is a lot of different ways SoE could approach this whole issue.  I for one am just hoping they do something at all.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Fixed a spelling issue or two. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klotar</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the idea of an innate (non-aa, warrior only) aggro multiplier, works with all weapons by multiplying hate generated by melee by a small percentage increasing by level.  Starts at lvl x with a 1.y multiplier and peaks at lvl 60 with a 1.z multiplier.  Possibly increasable with PoP AA, starting at lvl 61.  Might be different multipliers for 1 hand and 2 hand weapons.<br />
<br />
Wouldn't give guaranteed taunt/aggro but for equally equipped and hasted tanks wielding the same weapons, the warrior will gain hate at a constant rate over other classes.  This could be fine tuned later if necessary to produce the desired results.<br />
<br />
No idea if this is original or not but I did think of it a couple hours ago on my own.  :)  I can't think of anything terribly unbalancing about it off the top of my head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braeorn</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Innate agro...I think thats one of the best Ideas I've heard yet. It would take some time to tweak it so that it wasn't totally lopsided, but I bet it would be a fairly simple fix to the problem without nerfing other classes.<br />
<br />
Nice, simple...I like that being Barbarian</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gyzz</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think unhooking Disciplines is a good idea, but I don't think that we should be able to use more than one /disc at a time due to some balance issues that might occur.  I think it's more realistic to ask that each disc have it's own seperate refresh time, instead of sharing the same timer.  Maybe that's what is being proposed, but it sounded like there were folks asking for discs to be stackable.<br />
<br />
Also, I would want these changes to be universal for all warriors, and not just for warriors that are 65 with 100 AA's.  Obviously, they would need to be scalable in relation to one's level.  The disparity between warriors and knights begins in the mid 50's, and only gets worse as levels increase.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just to add hastily, the concept of an aggro multiplier is already in place, it's just not innate.  The enchanter Visage line and SK Voice line do this as a buff, but I'm suggesting something innate to warriors that will take any hate generated (melee and procs) and apply a small multiplier on top of whatever hate those usually generate.  Whether tables are used or formulas, beats me; but if they used the existing math from the aggo increaser buffs which exist already and seem to be balanced as a basis to start from, it wouldn't need to be researched/developed from scratch.<br />
<br />
Wouldn't be a guaranteed sure-thing against the over-critting wizard or non-evading rogue but it'd certainly help a warrior do thier job.  :)<br />
<br />
Whether the buffs can be stacked on top of innate aggro is a balancing issue I suppose but it seems to be something that can be factored in and tuned (from a non-programmer's point of view).</div></div><hr />

Please don't group with any warrior till all these lazy people get off their butts and start throwing fits to get taunt fixed. No class has been SCREWED as many times by Sony. Warriors have just laid there and taken it, guess the players are just wimps. No other class puts up with this crap, they scream mighty loud. Not grouping will force the lazy people playing warriors to get off their butts and do something. I am tired of arguing for warriors to be fixed, all these idiots say &quot;I like me warrior, sitting for hours LFG is FUN&quot;. Tired of the do nothing lazy players that picked warrior as there class and act more like wimps.<br />
1. Fix our DPS, raise it, no more arguing.<br />
2. Raise our defense<br />
3. Raise taunt through the roof, who cares if it makes encounters trivial, they already are!<br />
4. Let warriors solo, screw it, you got half the casters quading, bards swarm kiting, paladins slaying undead for 5-7k damage, SKs HTing for 7-9k damage. The game is already screwed up beyond belief.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In order to truly fix warriors, a number of things can be done, but not multiple things in conjunction.  The most valid point warriors are currently make is:<br />
<br />
-Warrior agro is way below the levels of Knight agro for the HP/AC difference that exist between the two classes.  While in raiding, a warrior is still unchallenged, the majority of EQ players are not raiding 24/7.<br />
<br />
The only two solutions that can be accomplished, but not both in conjunction with each other, would be:<br />
<br />
1)  Create a new mitigation table for Warriors so a difference in tanking ability can, in fact, be established between Warriors and their Knight counterparts.  <br />
<br />
-OR-<br />
<br />
2)  Increase the agro generation rate of warriors to be more in line with the HP/AC differences that Knights have, as it's very little as it is.  <br />
<br />
But how to we balance this out without unbalancing something else?<br />
<br />
My idea, as proposed by others (Idea isn't mine), is to add a random chance of a second taunt check upon failure.  A second taunt check on a success would be useless, as we all know taunt just brings you to the top of the hatelist.  The idea would be much like the random chance to stun on a successful kick post 55.  <br />
<br />
Another idea would be to have a random Hate-Over-Time proc generated upon a successful taunt check.  Maybe 225 points over 3 ticks?  That would mean 75 points of hate would be added to the mob's hatelist every 6 seconds.  Now why a &quot;spell&quot; like ability added to taunt?  Well, I figured since they're screaming and cursing the hell out of these mobs, maybe we hit a soft spot in our enemy's personality to piss them off.  ;)<br />
<br />
I mean, I'd be a little pissed if I was Vhyz`dra the Cursed and told I was Cursed cause I was worthless and my mother hated me....and, like, stuff...  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My idea, as proposed by others (Idea isn't mine), is to add a random chance of a second taunt check upon failure <br />
<br />
Read that and the thought popped into my head for a skill &quot;Double Taunt&quot;.  Works kinda like double attack.  When you make the skill check, you get that second taunt in.  Give it to warriors at say level 40, cap at whatever appropriate.  Would certainly be a nice taunt upgrade.  Whether it is feasable or not I do not know, but was just the thought that popped into my head.  Or is that what you where proposing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, basically double taunt.</div></div><hr />

No stacking a chain of evasive -&gt; defensive for 6 minutes of amazing mitigation.<br />

One way or another, the pure melee types need some lovin' or at least some KY before the next upgrade for spell casting classes comes around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are two potential solutions I can think of....<br />
<br />
1.  Widen the mitigation gap between knights and warriors so that there would be a noticeable difference between the two... along with that, create a set of spell lines for both knights to create a new group role, one of 'aggro management'.    Sk's are on track to do this already, but to make it even more apparent... if a spell line were introduced that allowed SK's and Paladins to &quot;allocate hate&quot;, and warriors were clearly better mitigators of damage, then you'd have a situation where each class could fill the role as tank adequately, but with drawbacks, but when both are grouped, all of a sudden you have the aggro generation of the knight with the tankability of the warrior.   It's the only way &quot;tank stacking&quot; could work properly.<br />
<br />
2. In the absence of that, substantially increasing the mana cost of generating aggro by knights would force the issue of aggro management, for without it, the knight would run oom leading to the consequence of downtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh god, I have to disagree with Frodlin.  The man is like my role model, some one I aspire to be like, but still...<br />
<br />
Widen the mitigation gap between knights and warriors so that there would be a noticeable difference between the two... <br />
<br />
I just cannot see that as a solution, for a couple reasons.  First is that it would create unbalance with high end encounters.  These were tuned with current mitigation.  If you raised warrior mitigation, and warriors tank most(at least) of these encounters, there are some balance issues that would surely crop up.  Second is that even if we did mitigate noticably better, it does not help in an exp group situation because mana is generally not an issue.  Knights will still be able to tank well enough, and keep others from being hit, and will therefore be the preferred tank.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
...along with that, create a set of spell lines for both knights to create a new group role, one of 'aggro management'. Sk's are on track to do this already, but to make it even more apparent... if a spell line were introduced that allowed SK's and Paladins to &quot;allocate hate&quot;, and warriors were clearly better mitigators of damage... <br />
<br />
And if knights where still able to generage that hate for themselves, the group would still be better off just using the knight and a high DPS person.  It is incredibly rare for a cleric to run 00m in an exp group any more, at least by tier 2.  Therefore, assuming unlimited mobs to pull, using a knight and an extra DPS class(and more DPS meens taking less damage, as the mob dies faster) would simply be more efficient.<br />
<br />
...then you'd have a situation where each class could fill the role as tank adequately, but with drawbacks, but when both are grouped, all of a sudden you have the aggro generation of the knight with the tankability of the warrior. It's the only way &quot;tank stacking&quot; could work properly. <br />
<br />
I would love to see an effective way to stack tanks in exp groups.  I love the thought of just having an extra tank there, to off tank if needed, or in the healer lag spikes and main tank goes down, the second tank can take over.  Grouped with a pally friend, he has saved me(and the group) more than once when a cleric LD's or just lags and he starts to spam heal, with LoH ready if needed.  The trouble is, that as long as knights can tank well enough(and they should be able to tank well enough) for exp groups, and have a significant agro advantage, the group is better off adding DPS over improved mitigation.<br />
<br />
Now, please be gentle with me Frodlin while you tear up my arguments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haha,<br />
<br />
I'm not gonna tear your arguments up... I'm just going to ask you to look at the two parts of the 'solution' as a whole rather than as two parts.  <br />
<br />
-IF warriors seriously did mitigate damage to a noticeably greater point then knights, you'd have a reason to have the warrior tanking.<br />
<br />
*AND*<br />
<br />
-IF knights had a spell line where they could cast *through* someone else increasing THEIR aggro, but not cast it upon themselves (i.e. Paladin begins to cast &quot;Dictate Stun&quot;, Frodlin stuns mob_01, mob is angry with Frodlin).<br />
<br />
These would *have* to work in conjunction with one another...<br />
<br />
THEN - The warrior/knight combo would be a better tanking asset  than either warrior or knight alone, with the warrior's aggro weakness, and the knight's tanking weakness relative to the warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did understand that, and I do like the idea.  I would like to see tanks being stackable.  That said tho, even if a knight could make a warriors agro knightlike, would not a group be better off just using the knight(who can tank well enough) and a high DPS class?  Assuming that cleric mana is not an issue(and in my experiences currently it rarely is) I would think that is the case.  I would think on very high DPS mobs your idea would be awesome(not in ele planes, so there it might be preferred, I cannot say), but on tier 2 or 3 exp mobs, a group would still rather have one of those 10 or so wizzies with lfg plus a knight over a warrior and a knight.</div></div><hr />

But seriously folks, in the kunark era, hybrids did indeed need some help....SOE/VI just went way overboard in implementing it.  I still remember how irritated I was when I heard they were increasing hybrid offensive and defensive skills, lowering the level required for some of their spells, AND removing their xp penalty.  Some part of that was a good thing, all of it together was too much.   Thinking back to my AD&amp;D days, Paladins were for all intents and purposes, warriors who had some extra perks and weak spell casting ability, but they paid a price for that in having an xp penalty.   A similar case was rangers, who IIRC, didnt have an xp penalty, but did have to wear light armor for their extra abilities to work.  So, either figure a way to have hybrids once again pay a price for their extra abilities, or make it so that they(knights) are NOT more or less on equal footing with warriors in the tanking department.  Seems logical enough, but it won't happen.   I still remember how irritated I was when I heard they were increasing hybrid offensive and defensive skills, lowering the level required for some of their spells, AND removing their xp penalty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FennyMT</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 08:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another idea would be to make ALL warriors unstunable from the front.   This would leave knights stunable, and give us an opportunity to continue attacking in order to generate agro.<br />
<br />
Most times war loses agro I'll be it's because we are stunned.  Unless we immediately proc afterwards, it's likely the mob turns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thak</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 03:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, I'm starting to think that it's beyond fixing without bringing a massive nerf down on the knights' heads.  To fix it for raid encounters would be easy enough, up warrior mitigation and the effect of mitigation aa's for warriors...but that doesn't matter so much in an xp group, like Redhenna said.  To increase the mana cost to a point at which the knights would be unable to sustain aggro over a long period of time would kill any other usefulness those spells might have...simply because the way mana regen is now, it's terribly hard to run most people oom in an xp group.<br />
<br />
Fenny - I rarely ever lose aggro simply because of stun...and if you make all warriors unstunnable from the front...then you've messed with &quot;racial balancing&quot;...ie dorfs get sense heading, de's get ultravision, ogres get frontal stun immunity...so that's a no-go too.<br />
<br />
A class-based modifier on item hp would be an interesting thing to code, but probable well-nigh impossible, given the massive change to the whole item database this would necessitate.  Like, warriors get 100% of hp, knights get 90%, rangers/rogues/monks/beastlords/bards/clerics/shamen get 80%, casters get 70%.  Either way, it's basically a pipe dream.<br />
<br />
I guess my main hope lies in future games, or rather the people creating them...I seriously hope MMORPG designers are looking HARD at EQ, and trying to find a solution to the class balance issues that itemization/drop table programming in EQ has created.</div></div><hr />

Frodlin said,<br />
<br />
-IF warriors seriously did mitigate damage to a noticeably greater point then knights, you'd have a reason to have the warrior tanking. <br />
<br />
I'm curious Frod, what difference in mitigation do you feel would be noticeable enough to a group that they would choose a warrior over a knight for tanking purposes?  <br />
<br />
Perception is the key thing here not even hard and fast numbers, if there is no absolute need to have a second tank in group to boost the first's aggro then the advantage offered by warrior tanking would have to be extremely noticeable to make the idea attractive.<br />
<br />
With that in mind would 5 seconds more between heals be enough for the cleric to think 'this is cool', 10 perhaps? How many more hp's (to use a simple scale) would you think that would equate to? <br />
<br />
Given that, Would that performance differential scale up well with the difficulty of Boss mob encounters throughout the game (not just POP elementals)?<br />
<br />
My initial feeling on this is that it would not.<br />

That's such a stinking pile of BS and you know it.  Raid encounters designed around aggro difficulties are easily overcome without using 'skill'.   They're overcome with high aggro spells cast and assuming enormous amounts of &quot;jumpstart&quot; aggro.  <br />
<br />
The fact that you said &quot;warriors are already the near exclusive MA&quot; shows to me that there's a MAJOR problem... if all of our woes have been designed around being raid level tanks... then dammit, there shouldn't be *near* exclusivity.. there should be TOTAL DOMINATION WITHOUT QUESTION.  There simply isn't, so many mobs in EQ are now *better* tanked by non-warriors it's not even funny.   <br />
<br />
It's not some high skill level that makes clerics shorten their Ch rotation by 1.5 seconds, it's merely another interval.   It's the unintentional yet systematic destruction of the class because of a lack of foresight, and our simultaneous willingness to be the &quot;abused wives&quot; of EQ always looking for excuses on the part of our abusers.</div></div><hr />

Great idea, let's remove the &quot;skill&quot; in maintaining agro from encounters &amp; tune them all back to half hour snoore fests.  Let's bring back pre-nerf mod rods while we are at it, eh?<br />
<br />
The fact that you said &quot;warriors are already the near exclusive MA&quot; shows to me that there's a MAJOR problem <br />
I don't know about you, but every guild I have been in, in my 3+ years of playing has used a warrior as MA.  The only exception has been when plowing through yard trash in the likes of PoF or PoG.  I only added &quot;near&quot; because of the not so uncommon use of knights as MAs on yard trash (they can have that job).  No matter what level of the game you are at, if you are taking on the most challenging mobs for your guild, you are using a warrior MA.  Don't go boohooing because I threw in &quot;near&quot; as if guilds are tanking Reparm with palys.<br />
<br />
The problem, as I see it, is not raid agro (we aren't losing our role as raid MA over it).  The problem is competing with knights as xp tanks.  Don't start asking for more than what is really needed, or else we will get nothing.  This reminds me way too much of knights begging for dual wield back in the day.  Focus on the real problem.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">raznor</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 12:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok here's some ideas: <br />
<br />
-Move warriors to their own mitigation table, make it so a warrior's mitigation is 10 or 15 percent more than the same level knight naked with equal stats, let gear expand that difference. <br />
<br />
- AA skill that lets a warrior improve the chances of taunt succeeding by 2, 5, and 10 percent. <br />
<br />
- Ability to do a burst of damage at the expense of stamina.  Will cause an fatigue effect that won't allow invigor to work for a period of time.  The result is some &quot;snap agro&quot; at the expense of damage later in the fight, that way you can spike your hate above slow. <br />
<br />
I like the double taunt suggestion, maybe that can be gained at 55 to line up with the 2nd tier openings.  Maybe not all those together but one or two of them would work. <br />
<br />
  Also what they should do with paladins is scale the hate generated on their stuns so they're effective for agro in the level range they're meant to be used in but wane as the class gains new stuns.  So by 65 a paladin can't use level 9 and 15 stuns to hold agro but will need their top stuns to hold it.  The result, I hope, would be warriors and knights would all be effective tanks equally wanted in exp. groups. <br />
<br />
Also I don't think it's fair to say this or that can't be fixed for one class because of raid encounters.  Not a fair burden for a class to bare and there's alot more to the game than just raids.  Plus, I don't think any of the improvments suggested would make big encounters trivial, it would just help a warrior gain agro faster not hold it better in the long run and make a cleric rotation a few seconds longer.  <br />

These changes to exp ranges and bonuses are making exp outside PoP somewhat of a viable option.  Knights shine in PoP because of unsurpassed agro control in a place where that agro control is needed...however agro isn't as big a deal outside PoP, slowers won't die between taunts as much.  Since the agro benefits outside PoP aren't as great, are knights really going to lose out to warriors there?<br />
<br />
 Eh, time will tell, been so long since people fought outside PoP that it'll be hard to make a decision based on it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont think any changes should be proposed relating to altering proc rates or aas which alter proc rates, because then u get back to the whole issue of itemisation and proccing aggro weapons.<br />
<br />
To me, the main issue really is generating sufficient aggro at the beginning of a fight so my ench/slower doesnt get pasted. After that, as long as a group knows what they are doing, fine. I wouldnt dream of asking for aggro generation like pallys/SKs to enable me to lock aggro for a fights duration. Thats their advantage and should remain so. One solution would be for something like AE taunt but on a 1-2 minute timer. That way it can be used once per fight but wouldnt add to our aggro generation over the course of a fight and would not gimp raid encounters.<br />
<br />
However, by giving us such an ability, and perhaps some increased mitigation, groups will then be faced with a choice - <br />
<br />
group with a warrior - your slower wont risk death like before, but ull still have to watch your aggro during the fight. However, if you do so, your cleric gets slightly increased efficiency from the better mitigation of the warrior plus the fact that they do carry a bit more ac/hp than knights.<br />
<br />
group with a knight - again, your slower wont risk death and you can have a little bit more leeway with your casters without worrying about them overaggroing. However, healing is slightly less efficient. Plus of course u get all the utilities which knights bring.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Again we come to another problem, Knights MTing xp group Dont really affect healers mana supply as it is. There is NO trade off using them in the healing department. I group withe the same people a lot. When I MT, the cleric goes LOM on a periodic basis, when the Pal MT's she never goes LOM... Btw I have 1500 more hps and more AC than the paladin, healing the MT either me or the Pal is not the problem. It is the supernal eliixir and other FAST heals that the rest of the party need which cost MORE than CH that cause her to run OOM.. If I have agro Lock she needs 1-2 CH a mob in PoTactics.. If I dont she still needs 1-2 CH's + she needs 3-4 fast heals or MORE to keep rest of party alive. Increasing mitigation WOULD not make us viable on its own. Only by uprading our aggro AND increasing mitigation will it change any realities.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, thats it, a rallying cry.. GIVE US AGGRO!<br />
<br />
say it loud say it strong.<br />
<br />
There is NO way anyone can say that more aggro on a warrior will make ANY PoP encounter trivial compared to now. Hell Paladins MT on every SoV, SoL mob now with aggro lock and no noticable change..<br />
<br />
We want AGGRO, we want it NOW.. <br />

<br />
the reason why your cleric had to cast extra heals is down to the group not managing their aggro. LIke i said, as long as i can maintain aggro throught the first slow, which is all i want really, then im happy for knights to have the advantage of having better aggro generation througout the rest of the fight. <br />
<br />
i have also swopped MA roles with SKs and Pallys and clerics have said what a relief it was because my hps werent going down like a lead baloon. sure theres a few good pally and sks around who can match all but the best warrior, but your average joe pally/sk can be some way behind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is exactly what you should be asking for.  Better mitigation screws up raid encounters, so forget about it.  SoE has stated that a major concern with balancing warriors is raid encounters, so stop asking for crap you are never going to get.<br />
<br />
An aggro modifier does nothing to solve your problems...an extra 5, 10, 15, or 20% still doesn't get you through the first slow.  If warriors held aggro through a slow, you would suddenly be excellent choices for xp tanks again.<br />
<br />
Warriors need to be fixed in a way that makes them equal (or a shade better) at xp tanking than knights, while not changing raid encounters.  Asking for anything else is a waste of your breath.</div></div><hr />

If Affliction Haste has sped up casts and our Taunt has got no recycle mod arent we in essence nerfed?<br />
<br />
Affliction Haste I, II, III, IV = Affliction Hate I, II, III, IV gives added hate to wearer of armor - same as ench/sk line of spells. this can be tuned to affect the level of player/armor that is having the issues right now.<br />
<br />
The ability to raise attk pre Vengence XXMCM, attk = dmg = hate (or at least thats what were told were supposed to use to get/hold aggro) so lets beef up attk aggro since procs arent reliable and mobs have definatley been beefed up big time.<br />
<br />
Suggesetions:<br />
1. Taunt recycles faster with Haste - still doesnt trivialize but doubles our chances at success, doesnt add to DPS, doesn't change any class balance in any way.<br />
2. Cap STR at 355 with AA's - still doesnt trivialize but adds to our DPS a bit and adds to our aggro<br />
3. Raise Taunt to 250 (I bet they're planning to raise it with Expansion_06) LOL - this is long overdue<br />
4. Affliction Hate I-IV on armor - Allows us to generate hate without adding DPS or trivializing xp groups, doesn't change any class balance in any way.<br />
:) And an update to Hammerfall type quested bracer to match current content (Summon Magic Arrow Bracer !!!!!!)<br />

One thing that could deal with this issue and not unbalance raids is if we had a method to guarantee a hate proc of some kind at the start of a battle, but only at the start of the battle so that we don't have too much aggro control.<br />
<br />
Seems to me this mechanism already exists in the game, rogue poison.  If warriors were able to poison blades/arrows/throwing items with a poison or poison like substance that generated substantial hate, we could get over that initial important few seconds.<br />
<br />
If only rogues could make these poisons, but they were cheap, it would please SOE that it would revive interest in poisonmaking becuase rogues could make a little profit from selling stacks of poison to warriors.  Of course everything should be vendor sold cheaply so that warriors have easy access to it.   The cost really shouldn't be more than what clerics have to put out for peridot costs per grouping.  And of course different levels of aggro poison would exist for those more daunting encounters.<br />
<br />
Poison has to be applied while sitting, so impractical to reapply during combat.  It gets used on first successful hit from that weapon.  So we could generate hate on the inital hit, and we can have a poison dagger ready to throw in case of adds.<br />
<br />
We are supposed to be masters of all forms of combat, so I don't see the use of poison as out of line with warriors.  Also this could add some much needed utility to warriors in bad situations, but at a cost.</div></div><hr />

I'd much rather see innate warrior abilities that increased our aggro than rely on anyone else.  Giving crits and crips a dot or debuff component (or better yet giving us special attacks that snare/debuff or something) would be way better imho.  I do like the idea of effects on armor that increase our hate, but I'd still rather it be innate to the class, because not everyone has the same access to gear.</div></div><hr />

I don't really like the idea of haste speeding up taunt skill. If the taunt skill refreshes too fast, there ends up being a much smaller penalty for using it at the wrong time. Another way to put it is that there would be a much smaller benefit for being wise with use of the taunt button. It would end up being another button to mash constantly.<br />
<br />
I do like the idea of innate item type effects for taunt. Maybe have them range from +5% - +15% chance of a successful taunt.<br />
<br />
They could also add in an AA that increases chances of a successful taunt by 2%, 5%, and 10% with the same costs/level requirements as the Luclin archetype AAs like ND/CS/CA.<br />
<br />
Neither of those by themselves would be massive enhancements, but adding them all together would give a pretty damn big boost in aggro control without fundamentally changing the way warrior aggro works.<br />
<br />
Since those modify the taunt skill without giving a specific amount of hate, it would scale with the level of the mob being fought. It would also reward those warriors with the greatest understanding of the taunt skill the most.</div></div><hr />

We are competing with knights for group spots, for whom waiting 6 seconds for the taunt button to refresh is meaningless.  If the mob does not turn on taunt, they cast and regain agro.  Haste speading up taunt would allow warriors a chance(tho by no means a guarantee) to regain agro in a similar time frame.  Knights already have an advantage in that they are less likely to loose agro, something that would help warriors regain it faster would I think be a positive.  I can speak from personal experience just how long that 6 seconds seems at times.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having a 100% success rate at taunting the mob off a half dead chanter every few pulls won't get you groups.<br />
<br />
Being able to pop the mob once per fight with a special hate inducing attack to keep aggro through slows will.<br />
<br />
If well implemented, this would also give you a better hate lead to keep aggro through the rest of the fight.<br />
<br />
Yes, you still won't get as many groups as a knight who can lock aggro through chain nukes.<br />
<br />
But you have to draw the distinction between asking for a fix to make the average warrior viable again, and demanding the fix be so huge warriors would become dominant as tanks.<br />
<br />
The first you MIGHT get with a lot of luck; hey even shadowknights and paladins are calling for it.<br />
<br />
The second you might as well forget about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you wanted to be dominant at something, you choose the specialist class. If you want to be slightly less effective at it, but have utility, you choose the generalist class.<br />
<br />
What is so hard to understand about the sheer breadth of utility shadowknights and paladins bring to a group besides their tanking abilities.<br />
<br />
I don't care how you try to rationalize it, the fact is, warriors should be obviously superior tanks -- and they should be this way intrinsically, not only through gear or AA. Warriors of all levels should be the number one choice when looking for a TANK.<br />
<br />
Knights will still get groups because they (the vast majority of us hope) will not be nerfed, and besides, they fulfil very useful generalist roles in a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakkin</div><div class="date">06-14-2003, 07:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Underline the fact that the average warrior is unsafe to use as a group tank in PoP and ask Sony to make them viable again, and you might get it.<br />
<br />
Maybe, just maybe.<br />
<br />
Ask them to knock class balance on its head, and make warriors intrinsically the sole dominant tanks while relegating knights to a utility role, and you won't.<br />
<br />
Having a serious problem which needs to be fixed is not an opportunity to ask for the entire game to be rebalanced to your advantage.  It risks making you look ridiculous and people will just laugh at you, like they did at druids asking for 90% rez and slows.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakkin</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 06:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a good question Valeris.<br />
<br />
Tank classes are so wildly unbalanced at the moment that I don't think letting the average warrior in PoP get and hold aggro safely enough to be viable will knock class balance awry in any way anyone would reasonably complain about.<br />
<br />
Having done that, it remains to be seen whether the demand for trivialised aggro control is such that casters won't tolerate anything but knight lock-down MT aggro.<br />
<br />
Given the better equipped warriors don't seem to have great problems getting groups right now I'd assume not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Better equipped = 'raid guild' basically though - uber guild folks group in uber-guild groups the vast majority of time thus any problem is less glaringly obvious anyway. (It was a source of frustration but not a killer for me as an example). Personally I think aggro-lock shouldn't be in the game at all - Not for any class where working to gain aggro is a good thing, heh. <br />
<br />
In my opinion, So long as any tank class can virtually garantee aggro, there will never be 'balance'.  Heck, if it's dangerous to use a single tank cause the slow can't land early thats one more reason to add an extra tank player as backup isn't it?<br />
<br />
Loss of aggro lock would no longer cripple a knight imho since they can tank pretty damn good, maybe that favours warriors slightly more for the prime tank slot (that is all we do after all :p ) but if grouping a second tank makes good sense then the extra abilities the knight can also bring to the table suddenly got a whole lot more useful for LFG purposes.....and they're still perfectly reasonable tanks in the absense of a warrior. This isn't kunark anymore, the difference in tankability is far less glaringly obvious than it was back than.<br />
<br />
Perhaps abilities would continue to need tweaking etc but as a basic model this makes a whole lot more sense to me than giving aggro near enough to knights that we can compete with thier aggro lock, thus perpetuating the 'single tank, no danger' methodology thats prevalent atm.... and causing so much competition for that single slot...<br />
