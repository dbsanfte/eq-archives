<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've asked this question elsewhere but never gotten a definitive answer - figured someone here would know for sure. <br />
<br />
This question is related to full exp giving mobs - dark blue, white, yellow and red;  not light blue or green. <br />
<br />
Here is what I am fairly certain was true at one time: <br />
<br />
A given mob in a given zone gave x amount of experience; the amount of experience was determined solely by the ZEM of the zone and the level of the mob.  In addition, the amount of exp per mob was directly proportional to the SQUARE of the mob's level. <br />
<br />
 As long as the mob was a dark-blue or higher, it would give exactly the same amount of experience to whoever killed it, regardless of their level (though of course less apparent experience to higher level players). <br />
<br />
Therefore, killing two level 50 mobs would give more experience than one level 60 mob. <br />
<br />
Okay, it seems to me that at some point in time they may have changed this so that you got additional experience from a mob the higher level it was relative to your current level. <br />
<br />
i.e. a level 50 mob would give more total numeric experience to a level 49 killing it than it would to a level 60 killing it.  More importantly, this would make the old 'square of the mobs level' thing not apply any more.  The additional bonus would make a level 61 mob worth more to a level 60 than two level 50 mobs would be. <br />
<br />
I have gone to the extent of reading through a ton of old patch messages but never been able to find a reference to this change which I think I remember.  Any definitive information on this would be greatly appreciated. <br />
<br />
confirm / deny / no comment.<br />
<br />
Any response is welcomed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe they implemented an automatic xp bonus at level 51+ if the mob is within 3 or 4 levels of you.  This happened when the con colors were adjusted so that XP mobs were never green.  I attributed this as the reason why PoValor XP noticeably dries up when you ding 64 and 65.  I don't know the size of this bonus, but I would guess it is 20%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you both for the replies.  At least that seems to confirm what I thought. <br />
<br />
I had hoped that someone might have more precise info on this; it seems like it would be a very important piece of information to have, but I guess if anyone knows, they're not talking. <br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically if you kill a yellow or red con you will get more xp than a blue con. So if you are 50 and you kill a level 53, you will get the same xp as killing a level 60 mob from my experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The huge bonus is for mobs within +/- 5 levels of you.  So a L65 gets crap exp in normal LDoNs because many of the mobs are high 50s and thus don't have the bonus.  Additionally, there seems to be the bonus for killing stuff that's tougher relative to your level.  I've left my 2 boxed cleric at L63 and it gets more AA exp in BoT than my 65 warrior.  Mobs are within 5 levels for both characters, so something else comes into play there.  It kind of sucks that there's effectively an exp penalty in many grind spots for getting L65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the additional information.  At least it's narrowing it down.  So it's plus or minus 4 or 5 levels, and then evidently even more if it's above your level. <br />
<br />
I may try to do a little experimenting to see if I can get more precise information.  I wish I'd done it a couple levels ago when finding a steady stream of yellow con mobs was a lot easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrachenfeldTP</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">from what i understand it's not 5 levels below you, but 2-3 or levels below you to still get decent exp. We followed this when leveling our zerk and it seemed there was atleast some merit to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lokkak</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This change was detailed in a Dev Journal (not a patch message.)<br />
<br />
The exp given is based on two factors:<br />
<br />
1) Average group level (and if you outside 5 levels of this level you do not get bonus exp.)<br />
<br />
2) Your level compared to the mob (also if you are outside 5 levels you do not get bonus exp.)<br />
<br />
The bonus was from 190 percent of &quot;normal&quot; exp to 290 percent of &quot;normal&quot; exp.  (Kill a level 60 mob at level 65 and get 1.9 times normal mob exp, i.e 1.9* ZEM * mob level * mob level; kill a level 65 and get 2.9 * ...)<br />
<br />
Now this being said, they ALSO change the whole system (but did not detail this change.)  They changed the back end so that there can be mobs of the same level in the same zone killed by someone that gives DIFFERENT amounts of exp.  So this is to say they can break the standard ZEM * Mob level * Mob level mode on a mob by mob basis.  This is prominent on quest events that spawn massive numbers of mobs back to back (i.e. many elemental events.)<br />
<br />
The old rules of how exp is distributed in a group (based on level of players) are still valid.  By this I mean if you have a level 60 in a group with a level 65, the level 65 will get MORE exp each kill than if the level 60 were a level 65 player.  It isn't much (1.5 percent more; (65+5)/((65+5)*4+60+5) compared to (65+5)/((65+5)*5) in a 6 person group with 60,65,65,65,65,65.)  In this environment, even with losing a couple percent exp to the level 65's, the level 60 can gain on average 30 percent more exp killing in zones with mobs from a min of 60 to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you, thank you, thank you.  That's exactly what I was looking for. <br />
<br />
If I understand correctly then, it does not get any better if the mob is yellow or red, just up to the point of an even con?<br />
<br />
That is extremely useful information, and it's good to know that I didn't dream it even though I couldn't find it in a patch message. <br />
<br />
It is surprising to me about the individual mobs thing - messing with the zem seems... I don't know - just not right. <br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
