<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Myrtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys!<br />
<br />
I've been hitting around with CHoS &amp; SotB and with the GSoT and I noticed most of the time GSoT is better for aggro as the 1handed combo, and of course the dps is better as well.<br />
<br />
I don't wanna start about ripostes but did I waste 15k by buying these weapons (ok, I know the statts are better) while I'd do better with a 100pp weapon?<br />
<br />
I really don't like the gfx of the GSoT and that's one of the reasons I bought these weapons, I hope to get the war only weapon from Xana (PoI dragon) soonish and be able to use my 1handers again.<br />
<br />
Any comments?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Belwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i use the same combo and have better agro with them while the GSoT rots in my weapons bag, until rispostes and damage shields start tearing me up:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aarekx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I generally use the chos/sotb combo while group tanking and gsot when tanking named mobs. <br />

p.s. I didnt buy any of them you can get the chos and sotb from the same camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, I've had the same experience as you Myrtiz.  Everytime I stinking dual wield the agro is Horrible!!!  Of course I don't have access to pure hate producing 1handers like BoC/Hategiver etc... and also have not been able to augment my weapons with anger procs yet but for now the GSoT has bee insanely good to me even when I miss 20 times just holds the agro.  One thing that is weird.  I've never trusted any other weapon besides GSoT for agro since everytime I switch my group gets in trouble, but the other day I actually switched to WMBS and held agro just fine.  Don't know if its a 2hander thing then (WMBS for agro sucked before incite for me) or an incite thing.  Will try dual wielding now that I have incite since ripostes aren't as big a deal for me (casual gamer no bosses most of the time) and see if it works.. but.. GSoT has never let me down.. well, mostlyl never.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I use the same combos and GSoT always seemed to be better aggro to me, and since everyone says its also better DPS thats the one I use most of the time. And now I need one more miraguls win and plan to put anger 2 on the GSoT and prolly also on the CHoS. I would love to go for anger 3 but it just seems a waste spending that much on the GSoT, a weapon that sells for 100 plat and looks so dumb.<br />
<br />
Of course I also have all 3 ranks of Punishing Blade now and still havent trained Ambidex, so 2 handers just seem to make more sense</div></div><hr />

I've had Ambidex for a long, long ass time, but it really doesn't make that much difference in terms of proc rates.<br />
<br />
If you look at it logically, the only reason to use 2h is to avoid ripostes.  By Dual wielding +hate (And by +hate I mean everything that generates aggro) weapons, you give yourself a much better oppurtunity to snag aggro when you need it....right away.  Instead of waiting on a proc from your only weapon, you've got the RNG working on BOTH weapons.<br />
<br />
People who claim to get better aggro from a single weapon with the same proc as their 1h combo just boggle my mind.  It's like you're not really trying or something...you get one fight where your weapons don't proc and go &quot;Dammit, these are shit, I gotta bust out the GSoT again.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok, goes a bit like this when choosing weapons :<br />
<br />
Potential Damage + procs + augment<br />
<br />
Now, what most should know about procs while dualwielding, is that offhand have much lower proc rate, half of what the primary hand have as far as I know.<br />
<br />
So a dualwield setup will not proc twice as much, nor have much higher damage potential, thus in some cases a 2H will be better aggro, depending on what wepaons you have available, especially in the case of GSoT since that is actually a pretty nice weapon (with horrible graphics though).<br />
<br />
On the other hand, there's more potential in the dualwield setup, for the simple reason that with Two Anger proc augments, there's a higher chance of getting a proc earlier, which means a lot .. and not only in terms of snap aggro.<br />
<br />
You do, however, take more Riposte damage as has been mentioned, and it is more costly to keep 2 weapon slots upgraded than just one.<br />
<br />
<br />
Correct me if I'm wrong .. it's late and I'm tired.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I have thought that perhaps this is my problem.  And to tell you the truth I never really give up trying dual wielding as a regular method (specially since I have more HP's with that set up).  As far as not trying hard enough I take it you mean leaving the dual wield set up there for awhile to really get a feel for it as there is nothing I can do about the fact that I &quot;Feel&quot; more secure about agro with GSoT.  <br />
<br />
Funny thing also that procs are being mentioned.  I &quot;feel&quot; and will use the term feel from now on as I don't parse much and don't really count on a piece of paper, that I hold better agro with a GSoT even when I don't proc and even when I miss 17 times in a row.<br />
<br />
Now, most of my decisions are based on &quot;feel&quot; so don't get me wrong Haass I think you're right and it boggles my mind too on how can I possibly hold better agro with just 1 weapon.  The only answer I've been able to give myself to calm perhaps my inability with simply holding on to CHoS + SoTB a little longer when they don't seem to do good is that I think perhaps &quot;intended&quot; damage with a weapon makes a difference on agro?<br />
<br />
I know it sounds like I'm full of shit and perhaps I am (hence will keep trying the Dual Wield set up).  But its like taunt, I just knew when it failed I didn't even need a message I bet at least 50% of the time I knew.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You are most likely seeing the difference on the potential damage difference, where I think the GSoT is winning over your dualwield setup. Especially if neither of them procs.<br />
<br />
Tha chance of having no procs early, gets smaller once you put augments in .. for obvious reasons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gunrack...I don't understand the difference either, but it could very well be the people you group with.  See, I've got this little problem of having a 65 rogue with a 15/20 and Rage combo with full offensive AA's standing across from me.  2h?  Hah, I've got no fucking chance in hell of holding aggro with anything I can obtain.  I'm not even sure my windblade outdamages dual wield for me at this point (Katta Banker needs a visit I think, because I was very dissappointed last time I pulled it out of the bag).  If you're typically grouping with lower level people (cough BoT anyone? 62 SHM WITH NO AA'S LFG!), then perhaps there's a reason that certain weapons perform adequately enough for you.  I'm convinced that this must be the difference in aggro perception, because you can't really parse aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>zhakran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">2 handers are where it's at. <br />
<br />
Sure, you can get a little better aggro via 2 or 4 procs on 1handers, than with 1 or 2 or the 2hander. For a long ass time, I MTed for my guild, wielded CHoS and SotBS, this was fine for aggro, and the whole time I had GSoT in my backback, because the dps difference was marginal and the procs from the 1handers are better. Then I upgraded to GBoS and CHSD and those were marginally better than the droga weapons, but still more procs than the GSoT and thus they got used almost primarily when raiding and tanking, because of how important it is to lock aggro on some mobs. <br />
<br />
When I got a GSot4W, it became my main weapon of choice, because the dps is just so much better than a dual wield setup. Also, I stopped MTing on raids very often if at all, so the greater DPS was king. Nowadays, if I'm MTing pre tier3 bosses, I dual wield for more procs and more solid aggro, the ripostes are not much of a factor. But in ALL other situations, especially now with incite being in the game, I think that whatever has more DPS is just gonna be the win most of the time. <br />
<br />
It's very questionable how much better aggro more procs is anyways, DPS is aggro and a higher DPS weapon is gonna help a lot. <br />
<br />
In my mind it works like this, GSoT and the droga weapons are *very* close in both damage AND aggro.(assuming no offensive AA's) Difference is, GSoT costs 2cp, and droga weapons costs 10kish each. If I camped them, I'd use them situationally and swap them out with my great staff, but if it was a question of buying them, I'd save the money for armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My experience has been swapping weapons in/out in XP groups.<br />
<br />
I have found that the cheapass GSoT holds aggro at least as good as the SoBS&amp;CHoS - usually the GSoT is better.<br />
<br />
I have recently obtained the CHSD &amp; BoC now - so, well, don't use CHoS &amp; SoTB much anymore.  <br />
<br />
I am close to augging the BoC - looking forward to aggro lock.<br />
<br />
Still, incite + GSoT is a damn good combo - at any price.  Just because it's cheap in the bazaar doesn't lessen the effectiveness of a warrior tool.<br />
<br />
Anyways, my 2cp<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">From my own expericance as a non planar warrior (IE nothing past BoT) in LDoN:<br />
<br />
Even before the agro patch I could mostly keep agro off elemental rogues with Iftar (sp??) using WMBS. Really if you have the CHoS/SoBs combo you have the potential plat for a WMBS (which most of the time I find to be better agro and damage than a GSoT).<br />
<br />
And, unless you see yourself getting better than a 31/28 2h, with fairly good graphics and a better attack animiation that the GSoT push broom, augmenting a WMBS with anger 3 makes a lot of sence. (Only issue being what the heck do you use when you aren't MTing....possibly.)<br />
<br />
I thing that WMBS &gt; CHoS/anythign and probably about the same price as a CHoS. That is what you shoudl be askign and I would vote WMBS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Lower level casters tend to generate more aggro for a lesser effect of spell (especially robes w/o spell casting subtlety). In addition if your dex is not above 200, procs extremely suck for getting aggro. Remember 2 procs per min is the number with max dex, meaning potential dps becomes more important.<br />
<br />
Also, tell the rogue to evade :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just have to say I spent the money on the CHoS and Sotb combo and used it for a week or so and promptly sold them back.  I think I gave them enough of a chance, and personally they just didn't work as well for me as the GSoT.  Of course this is all perception and thats kinda what it all comes down to, with so many people that argue one way or the other I think you just have to go with what makes you comfortable.  I do throw some more styling weapons on when I hit Pok though.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">What really baffles me is that the GSoT proc has the EXACT same agro component as a SotB WITHOUT the 75 dd. When you look at proc rates for an individual, the DEX is irrelevant because the proc rates will still have the same ratio whether or not you are at max DEX or not. Unless you are weilding one of the very few high proc rate weapons, you can assume that at max DEX a 2h weapon will proc 2 times/min and with a 1h set up, your mainhand will proc 2 times/min and offhand will proc 1 time/min giving you a ratio of 2:3. If you have less than max DEX, you will get a lower proc rate, but you will still have the same 2:3 proc rate when comparing 2h v. 1h set ups. Basically, your 1h set up is going to proc 50% more than your 2h set up.<br />
<br />
I still have my GSoT in my bag, and I weilded a CHoS+SotB for quite some time before getting my current weapon set up. As soon as I got the 1h set up, I switched and never looked back. Unless I get a BoW, I can't see switching to 2h any time in the near future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The ratio may be the same, but you will proc less. Meaning a lesser percentage of your total aggro is from procs and a higher percentage is from whatever formula is used to generate aggro from melee dps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">From my experience with an Anger II auged CHoS and a SotB, I gotta say that I find much more reliable agro with them. Of course, the GSoT is a great weapon, and I used it a lot before going back to 1h. I have it always with me in case of need (boss mob or whatever). But I wouldnt chage my 1h combo for it. I like dualweilding, and AAs like Ferocity or TM really increase your DPS (dont have Ambi yet, but planning on), and possibly putting them on par with my GSoT if not higher (with ferocity, you double attack a lot, and it feels like its more easy to quad, since both hands seem to double attack one after the other more frequently). Also, the 1h combo gives me more HP :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
For reference. (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3789&amp;perpage=15&amp;display=&amp;pagenumber=1)  Also true, however - assuming equal 2h and 1h AAs - a GSoT has very little DPS advantage over a GSoT+SotB. Even so, I would bet that the majority of a warriors agro STILL comes from procs, taunt, and Incite. I have a 35/23 axe with no proc and it doesn't hold agro worth a hill of beans even though it DPSes like a bad mofo. Sure, DPS is certainly part of the overall agro equation, but it is only a small part of it, and the effects are minimized further by the comparatively small DPS difference in the set ups we are discussing.<br />
<br />
That is not to say that the GSoT is not a great, even game changing weapon for most warriors as they level up. I just have a hard time believing that a GSoT would have an agro advantage over dual stun proc'ing weapons, particularly since I saw a considerable increase in agro when I switched to these 1hers.</div></div><hr />

I have a mad researcher club (anger 3) and CHSD (anger 2) and I still use the ol' GSot (anger 2) in day to day exp.  Why?  Because I like it....but I think PB3 is a part of my bias though.  Mayhap when I get ambi I'll see the world like Haass (I think all the droga weaps are fun though and you really can't go wrong either way).<br />
<br />
Kailyn, with all due respect old friend the WMBS &gt; GSot as a dps engine only...it doesn't hold a candle for agro (I use both....the WMBS with a damage proc is a nice animal though) as an off tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to mention the fact that the DPS difference between you and the REAL dps classes is often monstrous.  I killed Dozkear a couple weeks ago...I did 95k damage, the Rogue did 130k damage, and he wasn't even behind Doze the whole fight.  You think you're holding aggro with just DPS?

<br />
That is actually exactly what I am telling you.  I am having as hard of a time as you are understanding why.  I am not here to glorify the GSoT just for shits and grins so if thats what people are thinking, response is negative ghost rider.<br />
<br />
My hp's and Stats are way better dual wielding the CHoS and SoTB, why on earth would I willingly want to use the GSoT?  Cause by the gods it just works better.  I have not parsed the dual wield set up to see but I know with GSoT my DPS is around 51dps.  Truth be it though... I don't have to parse anything I know for a fact what works and what doesn't and that damned hammer and sword just aint doing the trick.  <br />
<br />
Now, before I get flamed I will restate what I said in my earlier post.  I won't give up and I will keep on trying the dual wield set up and see if its just me being picky on whether they proc early or not etc...  But I wish I could get a video of what happens when I don't have the GSoT equiped.  Also like I said on an earlier post as well, now with Incite it seems my WMBS also holds agro &quot;simlarly&quot; enough to the GSoT.  Yes there is no proc.  So maybe now with Incite those dual wielders will do better.  <br />
<br />
Sorry I cannot provide FACTS and Proof, but all the proof I need is me playing and feeling it out.  Wish I could explain it but I cannot.</div></div><hr />

Based upon that, I don't see 2h holding aggro anywhere near as well as 1h.  A lot of people say that the 2h holds aggro better for them.  A lot of people say it outdamages 1h.  I say it's lot of bullshit, and I gots numbers to prove it.  Granted I don't have Punishing blade yet, but I have a hard time seeing PB adding 13 DPS.</div></div><hr />

1) The SoD and the SotB are in two totally different teirs of weapons. If the SotB was anywhere near as good as the SoD.. or should I say if the SoD was anywhere near as bad as the SotB.. there wouldn't be such a drastic price difference.<br />
<br />
2) I'm not sure if you have it but just neglected to mention it, but you having Ambidex and not Punishing Blade will definitely make your 1h DPS appear alot higher than it should be if your skills with 1h and 2h were the same. (by &quot;skills&quot; I mean your chances to hit.. 1h getting extra chances via Ambidex and 2h not getting any extra chances due to missing PB)</div></div><hr />

The main reasons for the SoD's astronomical price are reputation and rarity.One came from an uber zone (at the time) and no longer can be found in game. One has a proc that does almost 4x as much damage. The only advantage the SotB has is the 0.0/65 stun. Perhaps it is the reputation that is clouding my judgement, but if I was the owner of a SoD, I'd cringe at comparisons to common drops from a upper-50s zone.

[/B]Isn't it 1200 either way?  2 mainhand procs/min + 1 offhand procmin of AngerII = 1200.  2 mainhand procs/min of AngerIII = 1200.  Or I've missed summat, and I don't know what it is.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps it is the reputation that is clouding my judgement, but if I was the owner of a SoD, I'd cringe at comparisons to common drops from a upper-50s zone. All of that is largely irrelevant. The difference between an SoD and a SotB is slight at best. For pure weapon DPS the difference between 12/18 and 12/19 would have to be parsed over a long period of time it is so close. As far as proc DPS, saying that one proc is 4x more damage may sound impressive, but the difference is going to be about 7 DPS assuming no resists. That also does not include the fact that the SotB proc will stun mobs to 65, which is pretty handy when fighting casters.<br />
<br />
SoDs are over priced because a) they don't drop any more and b) they don't have a min level so they are excellent twink weapons. Once you are 56+ there is no reason to buy an SoD over a SotB, for the difference in price you can get a whole lot of armor upgrades.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that the SoD is a 2+ year old weapon now. You can get substantially better from BoT with a couple of groups (Great Blade of Storms).</div></div><hr />

They are virtually identical.  Notice in my original post where I said that by swapping in the Sword of the Bloodsworn the only difference is 7dps due to magic?  It's fucking true, that is the ONLY difference.  Talking about the difference in DPS difference between 12/19 and 12/18 only gets more pointless as you add more haste.  For all intents and purposes, me with my SoD and Copper Hammer is essentially the same as the other warrior in my guild with a Copper Hammer and a sword of the bloodsworn.  I'm sorry you're still going by bazaar prices here, but price tag does not a good weapon make.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if you have it but just neglected to mention it, but you having Ambidex and not Punishing Blade will definitely make your 1h DPS appear alot higher than it should be if your skills with 1h and 2h were the same.

<br />
I didn't neglect to mention shit.  I included all of that in my post.  Unfortunately, I don't see punishing blade as a viable skill since it was introduced LONG after I bought Ambidex, and I will not be purchasing it.  If someone would be so kind as to do a parse with 36 haste and no extra ATK on the Windblade with PB3, be my guest.  I don't expect a drastic change like 15 DPS to suddenly make 2h a better option.  Even with a 10% increase in DPS due to PB3, that's STILL only 6dps, and it's STILL outdone by my combo, and that's a big if on an offensive AA.<br />

Does Ambi really add an amount of DPS worth the 9 points? I DW 99% of the time and already got TM3 and Ferocity 3 (Great AAs btw), and was wondering if Ambi was good or if I should use those AAs to get something like Stalwart.  <br />
<br />
One of the biggest reasons that I have ambidex right now is because I ran out of good shit to do before PoP, and Ambidex is a pre-req for Marshall basically.  It is not phenomonal for the return by any means, I've heard that it basically adds around 4% to your DPS, tho if I parsed it, it was a long time (and about 3 hard drives) ago and I don't have the data anymore..  The secondary reason for this parse was so that I can check out the gains on Ferocity.  I'll be able to tell you that very soon tho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing I can think of is the often referred to &quot;dam/delay scaled proc ratio&quot; thing you and others have brought up a number of times (basically that the # of procs scale with delay...making all weaps have the same proc rate over time).<br />
<br />
A crude framework <br />
<br />
15 delay main<br />
15 delay off hand<br />
<br />
31 delay GSOT<br />
<br />
The Gsot would be expected to proc at twice the rate of the main hand 15 to 31 delay (following the scaling proc therom).    <br />
<br />
It seems to me that the off hand of DW is not proccing as the same rate as the main (someone correct this as I have no idea of the proc rate on off hand to main).  If all that holds true then you'd see more procs with the GSoT (it being 2x procs, the main hand being 1x procs and the off hand being something less than 1x procs).  <br />
<br />
Beats me if this is true...guess parses would prove it 1 way or another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">If I read the parses in the Overlords sanctuary correctly, they have shown the proc rates are roughly this  :<br />
<br />
Mainhand = 2 procs per minute with high dex and any type of haste/delay<br />
Offhand = 1 proc per minute<br />
<br />
There are a few weapons that proc differently, ie. Blade of Carnage and Cleric Hammers, but they are indeed few. So, if you have a GSoT in mainhand, it will proc about 2 times per minute, and if you have a SoD in mainhand, that will proc about 2 times a minute.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, some theorize that Melee aggro is tied partyly to weapon damage bonus, and since 2H wepaons have higher damage bonus, they get a boost ni aggro from the pure melee part.<br />
No idea if it's trueand have seen no proof aganist or for it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and on a side note :<br />
<br />
I did roughly 55,67 DPS with a GSoT against even cons (Crystalline Golems) while tanking in PoV, with regular haste buffs, 31% haste item, no AA's and ranger ATK buffs.<br />
For a 100 pp weapon, that's nice. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit : DPS was actually a tad higher, 55.67 dps .. heh.</div></div><hr />

The reason 1h weapons have an advantage when it comes to procs is because there is an additional weapon proc'ing. Offhand weapons tend to proc 1 time per minute in addition to the 2 times per minute of the mainhand. That translates to a DW set up proc'ing 3 times per minute while a 2h set up will be 2 times per minute.</div></div><hr />

<br />
how does augmenting change those figures or does it?  If i used a 1hs combo (like CHoS and SoBS) and augmented ech with angerII would i expect to proc more often?  Would the same hold true for the GSoT?<br />
<br />
For my 2cu, <br />
<br />
I prefer the GSoT over the CHoS/SoBS combo, though i am not sure which technically produces more anger.  I say this mostly because I hate the knockback proc on the hammer, a SoD + SoBS combo would probably suit me better if I was going to stick to 1hs.  I've been working with a group of friend to do LDoN hard, and honestly I just have a hard time taking the extra ripostles at around 990ish a hit.  If you don;t then great, but I do (still need to finish off a couple more defensive aa's).  With incite I really don;t have any aggro issues, and as far as DPS the 1hs combo is pretty close to the GSoT.  I get spikes in DPS with the GSoT where over time I think the 1hs is more consistent.  I seem to parse my GSoT about 5dps over 1hs (11/17 and a 12/19).  <br />
<br />
Like all things this topic will always be hotly debated, and very few clear cut answers.  for 100pp give the GSoT a swing and see what it feels like maybe 1hs is better for some /shrugg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Doggabone: Yes, my math was off. Per minute, 3 x AngerII (2 from pri, 1 from sec) = 2 x AngerIII = 1200. My main point was that DWing 2 x angerII is as much hate as AngerIII on a 2hander for 1020 pts vs 1150.<br />
<br />
Tharak: Augments proc independently and at the same rate as innate procs. You can't proc both an innate proc and an aug proc off the same swing though.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the clarification :).  It's a good point, I hope I didn't detract from it for anyone perusing the thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Myrtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Auged my CHoS with anger II and will try to do the same with my SotB asap, hope I can dual wield again now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Personally, I used both options at different times, depending on the situation. As a 63 warrior, with no AA's other than Run3/Regen1, and no Ykesha/Anger augs, here's how I see it.<br />
<br />
I felt that the dual wield combo gave better long run agro, particularly against blue con mobs.  That means for most xp grinds, I preferred the CHoS/SotB for agro.  I would find myself losing agro too often using the GSoT in LDoN's, especially if I got a dry spell without any procs.  The dual wield combo seems to proc with more frequency, and the agro was noticeably greater in my opinion with this setup in LDoN's.  My GSoT is bagged 100% of the time in LDoN, and xp situations outside of higher tier PoP.<br />
<br />
However, I've recently begun hunting in HoH basement, Drunder Pit, and PoV golems, and personally I felt the 2H was better for several reasons.  First, all the mobs where I'm hunting are extremely upset by slows it seems.  I found that these even/yellow con mobs were less likely to turn on the slower if I used a 2H at the beginning of the fight instead of dual wield.  Can't explain why other than it just seemed to be safer for them if I used the 2H.  In addition, ripostes from these mobs are at the point that they are painful (potentially 500+ damamge) and I feel the 2H is worthwhile to use to decrease this damage output.  It is possible that the level difference comes into play here as well. <br />
<br />
Recently though, I have begun using a Greatstaff of the Four Winds (41/31 75DD proc) as my 2H solution.  It started as my DPS weapon for when I wasn't tanking, but on a trip to PoV golems I gave it a try, and the agro it generated was surprising. It easily outagroed my GSoT (unless I got a lucky streak of procs with the GSoT, which didn't happen often) and was a better solution than dual wielding in this situation due to heavy riposte damage.  I realize it's not fair to compare this weapon with the bargain that the GSoT is, but it sure was eye-opening to see how much agro can be generated from a fast, high damage weapon even without agro procs.  <br />
<br />
I think a smart warrior works out what works best for them and when.  If you can't afford (or can't camp) the CHoS/SotB, I certainly think the GSoT is going to be fine for you.  However, as I mentioned, I personally feel agro is better in LDoN's and other xp situations when I dual wield.  In these situations, I am not satisfied with the GSoT's performance compared to the CHoS/SotB.  One solution is not vastly greater than the other, though both options have pro's and con's that makes having both available worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">The Greatstaff of the Four Winds is indeed a nice weapon, and does real well with an Anger III augment in it according to friends. Quite possibly it will outaggro your dualwield setup once it's augmented. :)</div></div><hr />
