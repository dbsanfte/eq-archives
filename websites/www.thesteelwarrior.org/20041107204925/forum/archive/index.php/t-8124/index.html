<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Antaran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Those of you who have tactical mastery 3 should have seen the spam it generates.  For those of you that dont have this AA, well its a lot of spam, insane if your dual wielding.  <br />
<br />
Now my question is, how much of that spam is because a mob is ripoesting us and we succeed in a TM check so it fires off?<br />
<br />
Anyone catch my drift?<br />
<br />
I have broguht this matter to the boards before, the matter is dual wield has become a liability imo.  I will hold that opinion until proven otherwise.<br />
<br />
I would like SoE to think about this and I hope it will be adressed in a way that dual wielding warrior would take as much dmg from ripoests as a 2h wielding warrior/paladin ect.<br />
<br />
If anyone is willing to parse this, it would be interesting to see.  There has to be some formula that could calculate how the ripoest rate varies from 2h to dual wield or at least a rough estimate.  Now that we have the strikethrough msg, maybe there is a way to weed out dodge/parry based on skillcaps or something....oh well I'm not a math wiz.<br />
<br />
Anyways I would like to see this issue discussed more and brought to the attention of SoE if possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Since the rates for dodge, parry and riposte are all 5%, you could assume that 1/3 of all TM messages are ripostes.<br />
<br />
In reality, riposte is checked before the others, so it would be slightly more than 1/3.<br />
<br />
Personally, I would not want the riposte rates to be made identical between DW and 2H.  I like it when we have to make tradeoffs.  I wish there were more things that we had to weigh against each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A while ago there was a general nerf to mob riposte rate and as far as I can tell riposte level is pretty acceptable even for dual wielding now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">dw can get rough on ripostes, but only when the riposte hit for a heck of alot of damage.<br />
<br />
tm used to not stop ripostes though only allowed you to hit anyway. so we would have to clear this up first.<br />
<br />
then you would have to compare pre tm dodge miss parry riposte rates v. tm rates.<br />
<br />
then figure in spam from tm.<br />
<br />
should be fun for someone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kizef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For normal experience mobs I get between 1 and 11(KT mob) strikethrough messages. Now if 1/3 of these are repoist that can add up to a lot of damage extra.<br />
<br />
May have to play with 2hd weapon and see how many I get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Using a 2h you dont get &quot;so many&quot; msgs, but depending on the duration of the fight, I can sure get 7-8, even got 2 in the same combat round. I've been trying to see when the TM check is followed by a mob attack (supposely a riposte) but its kinda hard to get, would need to be parsed.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I wouldnt like that DW has the same Riposte percentage of 2h, there would be very lil difference, one of the reasons people use 2h is because of ripostes, it helps variety.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Anyway to filter the strikethrough messages? or better yet turn them off?<br />
<br />
The once an hour from strikethrough 5 on the darkblade wasnt a problem at all, but now Im getting spammed with anywhere from 5 to 20 messages per XP mob.  If it can't be filtered how about we all feedback for it to be made filterable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Someone said it's on the &quot;Other&quot; filter, but along with it, DSs. Double edged blade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hinterdir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">as far as i can tell, the message is still bugged and is generated even when you do not 'strike through' atm (mostly the mob doesn't even counter your attack)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grobie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes TM messages are filtered through &quot;Other&quot; filter - problem is if I direct that to a new chat window, much of what I personally consider important goes there too<br />
<br />
For example: somebody looting stuff, aggro messages from mobs etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">as far as i can tell, the message is still bugged and is generated even when you do not 'strike through' atm (mostly the mob doesn't even counter your attack)<br />
<br />
you can 'strike through' a mob's ripost/parry/dodge/block so if the mob didn't conter attack you, it might mean that it was a ST firing off another skill. Can you check it to be sure it worked intentionally or not ? (it might be interesting to know exactly what happens)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hinterdir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i have my and mob misses on, so i get all 'but mob xxx'es' messages and my logs from last night still show more than 50% unfounded strikethrough messages</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">that's really interesting... I wonder how theese dev have coded ST and TM to obtain such strange/stupid result/bug ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&quot;unfounded strikethrough messages&quot;<br />
<br />
perhaps if you strike through a mobs dodge/riposte/parry/block and negate the special defenses, you can still miss your hit on the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Some guildies were talking about melee'ing through enrage(from the front) and not getting hit back or at least not as much I guess they said.  That had always been a debate, if with TM you could avoid getting hit by ripostes and I know the answer was no it's truely an offensive skill and that you'd get hit back but also strikethrough.  Maybe they just weren't watching closely.</div></div><hr />

another one out of place and it just got done trying to bash me.<br />
<br />
so tm stays the same of 777 tm messages those were the only 2 types i found. tm just lest you get a hit in anyway and dosent block riposte.<br />
<br />
edit: bah i didnt count the riposte rate to get the %</div></div><hr />
