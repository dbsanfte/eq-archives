The people I am grouping with have some amazing weapons the paladin was using a 26 damage 24 delay with a heck of a proc  that had a +9 damage bonus. Sure made it hard to hold agro with what I have. Randers are using things that are 15/19 making it even harder for me. We have a great DPS but I need to make mine a bit more please.</div></div><hr />

Can anyone point me into a direction for upgrades later in a guild that has only done VS 1 time if that tells you where my guild is at and even then it took 40+ friends to help out. I have friends in high level guilds that I might get lucky enough to tag along on a raid and get rotting loot but it is doubtful. I am really thinking about just waiting until I can use the GSoT I have and add an anger 3 proc to it or something like that but I still would like to think I can look forward to something else obtainable.</div></div><hr />

Your gear is much better than what most warriors have at that level so if it aint broke don't fix it. If the pally keeps aggro get a 2HB and work your skill up for when you can use your GSoT.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sisthar</div><div class="date">11-01-2003, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">sad thing is my guild could not kill VS, we had to call in a lot of help, I am only in it because everyone in it are great friends and my sister in real is the guild leader.  What purchasable items might you sudgest?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your equipment is very good for your level...leveling up to 60 will help more than almost anything else.<br />
<br />
For equipment tho, I'd recommend upgrading that right ear (BEoE is a great upgrade) and you might want to consider a CHoS to go along with that SotB soon...augmenting both of those will also be good.<br />
<br />
Leveling to 60 is best for you, IMO.  If that pally is using a really nice weapon with a powerful proc...let him tank since he seems to want to...he'll learn if he's getting smacked down.  Whip out a good 2hb in the meantime (like someone said, for when you hit 55 and can use your GSoT...it's okay even if you've got low skill, but with maxed skill it's even better since you're doing good damage as well).</div></div><hr />
