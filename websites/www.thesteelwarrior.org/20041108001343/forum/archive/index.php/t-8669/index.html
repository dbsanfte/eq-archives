<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Whiteniteslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well its finally time to admit that I need a guild to progress further in this game. I play a 43 warrior boxed with a 65 druid, and altho I can still get some stuff to upgrade, I think a guild would help.<br />
<br />
I play on Morell Thule and would like to know if anyone here knows of any decent lower guilds that would be benificial to my cause. I also have a few RL friends that play on Luclin and say that their guild needs tanks. Should I go spend the 50$ to transfer my warrior to Luclin?? These are questions that I hope you folk can help with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you decide to transfer you might consider transferring with gear, you can transfer 2 characters for $75 I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bustauff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I play on Luclin. It is a pretty good server, got like 9-10 guilds in EP's+ right now, and only 1 currently doing VT (mine). We also have an open raid channel that is actually pretty impressive (well when the Bard Mortensen isn't leading the raids they are). There are quite a few guilds that would be in your range. If you want to get some info on the server go to www.eqluclin.com. Pretty nice server in general, but they do love their drama. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mavelloc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">if you want to progress by getting lvls, getting gear and AAs then just grouping with others will be fine but if you want to See stuff like what stuff looks like past the GY areas of zones then you will need to get into a guild, if there is nothing stopin ya then move over to the other server since you have friends there and make sure that they are ones that you really want to move over and play with because after the transfer you are stuck there for 6 months before you can move eitehr back or to another server and also your out 75 bucks if you move with your stuff, yes its a game but you are paying for it and you dont want to lose a friend over it and also dont want to waste your cash on a regret, might want to put some thought into whatcha want to do such as goals for yourself, yes again its just a game but no goal equal no motivation and no motiviation equals you are not going anywhere and your not upgrading so equaling to *drumroll* wasting your time that you will not get back  :eek: <br />

Good Luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It'd be nice to put your application in a pool, and have guilds look at them like that.  Then you could decide which guild you wanted to join from the offers you got.  That's wishful thinking, though.</div></div><hr />
