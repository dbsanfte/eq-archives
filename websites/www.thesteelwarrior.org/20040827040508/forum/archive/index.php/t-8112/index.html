No, they nerfed those items, and when they did they removed the ldon price (Oct 15, 2003).<br />
<br />
Any item that doesn't have a LDON price, can not be sold back.  It isn't a bug in the &quot;sell back&quot; but rather a penalty for those items that they felt were too powerful.  They use the ldon sale price as a flag of &quot;is it buyable today on adventure merchants&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Andrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Give me a break.  That is rediculous to not let me sell back the breastplate just like everyone else can.  I paid the same amount of points as everyone else, and I did the same number of LDON missions to buy the breastplate as everyone else.  How could you possibly think that is fair to not allow the pre-nerf armor to be sold back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From any merchant you buy the armor from in the first place...<br />
<br />
When ya browse the armor merchant's inventory, you should see a &quot;Sell&quot; button next to the &quot;Purchase&quot; button now.<br />
<br />
Highlight any LDoN purchased armor from your inventory, and then click &quot;Sell&quot;.</div></div><hr />
