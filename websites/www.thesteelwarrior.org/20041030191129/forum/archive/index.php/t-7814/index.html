<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was lurking around in Alla and found this <br />
Twisted Sword of the Fatesealer  (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6591)<br />
because I've never herd about it a wondering where it drops from a looked around on other boards and sites, and I found this :<br />
Twisted Sword of the Fatesealer  (http://eq.crgaming.com/data/item.asp?Id=5110)<br />
and aLucy was givin nothing.<br />
<br />
As you can see (if you follow the links) theese two blades share the same name, the same domage, the same delay but the stats are completly different.<br />
<br />
All of this, plus that it is uncommonly known, make me wonder if this was a fake item (if a remember the fake pics of  EQitem apeared between Velious and Luclin, flooding sites with fake items. and waht a coincidance, firsts post on theese seem to fit the date). Or maybe it's no longer droped.<br />
<br />
So my quetion is : is it fake ?<br />
if no, does it still drop ?<br />
if yes, who drop that ?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Yoda.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Edone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">lucy dosent like it by searching fate or twisted, so its either fake,or all of them are retired on unplayed chars<br />
<br />
i remember the screenie's origin was north temple of veeshan before they patched anything to make it more playable,apprently gotten from one of the north 3 when someone sneaked past or bugged arry,that was the story at least<br />
<br />
they definatly dont drop if it ever was real at one time, which is in question,or else we'd all have one~</div></div><hr />
