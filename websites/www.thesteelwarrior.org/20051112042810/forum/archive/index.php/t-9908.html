<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaqyl</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 11:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so I'm wondering if anyone can decipher the tooltip that pops up when you hover over &quot;Damage&quot; under &quot;Melee Attack&quot; on your Character Info screen.  Most importantly as to how it displays dps and using that to compare weapons.<br />
<br />
So right now I have three weapon setups that involve three weapons, 1h/shield, dual wield, and 2hander.  These are my weapons . . .<br />
<br />
Archeus (http://www.thottbot.com/index.cgi?i=7216) - 2H Sword 23.9dps 3.3speed Proc:85 arcane dmg<br />
Crescent of Forlorn Spirits (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=4160) - MH Axe 18.1dps 1.6speed 6spirit<br />
Splitting Hatchet of the Monkey (http://www.thottbot.com/index.cgi?i=6067) - OH Axe 16.1dps 1.8speed 3agi 3sta<br />
<br />
I think it should be noted that the Archeus and the Crescent both came from level35 quests, thus should be aproxiamately the same quality for their weapon category.  Also that none of these weapons modify strength which would affect my attack rating.<br />
<br />
Ok, lets start by listing each weapon's dps that is shown in the Damage tooltip . . .<br />
<br />
Archeus - 44dps<br />
Crescent of Forlorn Spirits - 38.2dps<br />
Splitting Hatchet of the Monkey - 35.5dps(Main Hand) / 25.8dps(Offhand)<br />
<br />
So the 2hander dps should be straightforward, but its the dual wield that gets me, I've heard so many different things about how the offhand weapon damage is calculated, I've heard 50%, 25% . . . ect.  As you can see the value I get for the Hatchet when placed in the offhand is actually about 73% of its dps if placed in the main hand. . . which doesn't seem right to me either, because if you just add that offhand value to the value of the Crescent you get 64dps, which seems grossly higher than the 2hander.  Then I decided to play with the numbers . . . I took the offhand dps of the Hatchet and divided it in half(50%) and a quarter(25%) and added them to dps of the Crescent, that looks something like this<br />
<br />
(50%)  38.2+12.9=51.1  -  This still seems a bit high, but at this point I'm doing pure guesswork<br />
(25%)  38.2+6.45=44.65  -  This only slightly exceeds the 2hander<br />
<br />
As you can see, even assuming only 25% of worst(offhand) dps value offered the dual wield combo still comes out on top for dps, as well as producing significantly more/faster rage.  So since I don't currently have a skill that does weapondamage+ that is NOT tied to weaponswings(read Mortal Strike), at the moment I'm not really using my 2hander at all, I'm assuming my dual wield setup is superior due to basically equal dps and superior rage generation.  Plus you know, as a dwarf I LOVE dual wielding axes so . . . . <br />
<br />
I'd love to hear any comments on this, or experiences that would shed some light on this situation as I'm sure its not just important to me.</div></div><hr />

Don't forget that when dual wielding you take a drop in accuracy in the main hand a greater drop in accuracy in your offhand so its not totally additive.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, dual wielding has its places but I don't think its as good as your damage tooltip analysis would lead you to believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of the dual wield posts I've read mention a 24% increased chance to miss with each hand while dual wielding.... so factor that into how much dual wield dmg you can output. I would be very interested inseeing some legit parses although I'm way to involved in playing now to consider taking the time to do it myself :) Until then I think I'm gonna find the highest dmg 2hander I can get my hands on and use it.</div></div><hr />
