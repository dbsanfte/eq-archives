<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drugant</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 11:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As an addendum to my post on +end items, I wanted to ask how commonly people run OOE (out of endurance) during a long named fight.  While I am only 54, I chained evasive with a bellow  on the Emperor in OS Crypt then popped mighty strike for a quick burst of dps at the end of the fight ran me OOE.  Not too big a deal normally, but my group was doing all the named in the crypt so we rarely had time for me to regain end.  I recall reading this is not so much of a problem later, but now I can't seem to find said post (should've bookmarked I know).  Everyone (or even some) have the same problem, or am I doing something wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 11:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'll have the same problem chaining discs until that glorious day (I guess) when you max 305 in all melee stats. I have it happen about once every third day, myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikos</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 01:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I am chain pulling I pretty much loose endurance in a steady manner. Because I am using it as soon as it refreshes.<br />
<br />
Incite eats away 8% endurance per use. You normally regen 5-6% in 30 seconds while standing.<br />
<br />
Whenever I get to Tank-mezz a Rathe Councilman I end up OOE shortly after defensive runs out.<br />
<br />
I start up with defensive and use Incite whenever it refreshes.  I need all the aggro I can produce since I tank the Councilmen with a shield and a hategiver.<br />
<br />
While Defensive is up, you dont regen endurance. You simply loose it at a steady pace. Every incite is -8% every 30 seconds. You can get 6 incite off during defensive. So thats   -48% endurance loss to incite alone while defensive is running.<br />
<br />
It takes defensive and around 12 incites to go OOE. <br />
<br />
It takes around 40-45 seconds or so to go from 0% to 8% endurance. <br />
<br />
I'm Level 65 and 305 on all melee stats. No endurance regen AA nor endurance+ items yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 02:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On bosses I usually do incite + furious followed by defensive and then a few more incites if necessary.  If I chain incite non-stop while defensive is going I'll run out of endurance before defensive wears off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn_emarr</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe I do a crappy job at managing my endurance but if I am tanking a boss mob fight I usually always run out of endurance during the fight. 5 or so Incite + furious + defensive / stonewall / evasive = 0% endurance.  <br />
<br />
When not tanking I use my DPS discs like fellstrike, charge. These eat up a lot of End. If a tank drops and I need to take over than I will most likely only get 75% use out of def / stone / evas before all my endurance is gone.  <br />
<br />
Then on other boss  mob occasions I would just burn fortitude if I had a few bad procs and the mean 2-3k hitting baddy is eating my lunch while I was not MT.<br />
<br />
If a stead to fast exp group I can usually keep my endurance up. If it's a fast adventure and I burn my DPS discs on a large pull to kill faster than I will be hurting for endurance because there is no real break for me to try and regen. I will try not to use incite if my end is below 20% but sometimes I have to use it to keep agro off of the slower. <br />
<br />
We need more endurance. I don't think I should fear running out of endurance unless I am fighting a mob who has an ability that drains endurance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On Terris Thule fights, im the one tanking TT during the whole thing while the others do their thing with the butterfulys and what not.  I only use incite during the 1st 50%, hit stonewall at 50%, so the healers have a chance to catch up on thier mana, and can survive the AE debuff.  I use incite sporodically after that, and by the time TT was down, i had enough Endurance for one incite on a gargoyle.  I run out pretty quickly.  They need to get endurance on old world items soon!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only time I run out of endurance in LDoN is when we are pulling so fast we are going to finish before 40 minutes. <br />
<br />
which means we are going to have to wait for another anyway.<br />

/shrug.</div></div><hr />

I need +end items yesterday.</div></div><hr />
