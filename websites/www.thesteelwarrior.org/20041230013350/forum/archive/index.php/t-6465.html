I was hoping for kicks for 100+, havent seen much of a difference from without having this aa.</div></div><hr />

I think you're a bit optimistic about seeing 100+ damage kicks as that would encroach on monks significantly.<br />
<br />
Just like the vast majority of other AA skills, it's a relatively small increase in power.</div></div><hr />

  This came up before, and still confuses me. How does a warrior kicking for more encroach on monks at all? The uniqueness of a more powerful attack that you click? Other than that fact, it's just a general way of increasing DPS. I don't think we need more DPS, or even to have strengthened strikes improved, it's just that it doesn't make sense to think of it as encroaching on monks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
just a personal opinion though, we tank shit, they kick shit. they don't tank like we do, we shouldn't kick like they do</div></div><hr />

Monk special attacks are one of the basic ways in which they do more damage than us and most other classes, in the same way that backstab is the primary way in which rogues do more.<br />
<br />
If we got an AA skill that let us do a special attack that did backstab damage, and had the same recycle time as backstab, do you think we just might encroach on rogue damage?<br />
<br />
Asking for a kick that does over 100 damage is the same sort of thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, we'd be encroaching on rogue DAMAGE, as you said. That's very naturally a balance issue. Is the only monk encroachment from a higher warrior kick that we'd do closer to monk damage? If so, then a 100+ kick would be encroaching on every DPS class in the game, not just monks. Why would it matter if it was from warriors getting an increase in kick damage rather any other way?</div></div><hr />
