<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How many would like to see Sony make an Everquest Movie?<br />
<br />
I heard there was one in the works awhile ago but havent heard anything since.<br />
<br />
Who would like there char to have a roll in this movie?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They could get the evil guy from the movie Highlander to play an ogre warrior and Angelina Jolie to play Firona Vie (I think thats the name of that high elf girl on the box).  Billy Crystal would make a good gnome necromancer too--not sure why but he just naturally seems to go with that role.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Esvee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The opening scene should show an ominous Barb warrior in black Time gear beating the crap out of a platoon of Pallies and SK's. <br />
<br />
He would then explain to a gorgeous young girl rushing to bind his wounds after that they had been after his job.....:D <br />
<br />
Esvee<br />
lvl 65 Overlord of Kylin Eyes<br />
The Nameless</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Azrael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I hope they don't.<br />
<br />
<br />
If they do, id probably be a sucker enough to see it =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would explode the world if Sony did that...<br />
<br />
IF they do take an undertaking that stupid, I hope they don't use the creative genunises (I spell like an ogre) who made the EQOA commercial.  I still have giggling fits when I think about &quot;Its time to kill the dragon!&quot;<br />
<br />
Wait a sec, maybe they should use those folks....</div></div><hr />

/em walks away whistling<br />
<br />
5th amendment is my friend. i ain't sayin' nothin if an EQ movie made it out. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bikamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Billy Crystal would make a good gnome necromancer too--not sure why but he just naturally seems to go with that role.<br />
<br />
Go watch The Princess Bride.  Check the guy BC plays in that.  gnome works!<br />
<br />
If they did make an EQ movie, what the hey story line would they put in it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I reckon they'd use old story lines, like lightly touch on the Ring of Scale, mainly talk about the old world.<br />
<br />
Too much gets introduced in RoK/SoV, and Luclin was just homo in terms of lore.<br />
<br />
And PoP, don't get me started.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Largic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'd like to see it, though would probably complain about it afterwards. Just like the craptacular Final Fantasy movie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Please no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It'd be funny to laugh at, but there's no way they could make an EQ movie without making a complete farce of everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Toham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sean Connery would need to be in it. And when a pally gets on a mob everyone needs to shout NERF FIX WARRIORS. And the whole movie just needs to be one RoV thing. yeah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The reason I have posted this is <br />
1 - to get an idea of what people thing about the Idea<br />
and<br />
2 - because I have writen a story line that I think (and my guild) thinks would make a good EQ Movie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">PM me with where you have the text uploaded to, I'm interested.</div></div><hr />
