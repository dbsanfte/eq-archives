This one is a readdly good read, I just started at the beginning and read all the way through. Al info is referenced here for verification, rumor mill is really low due to this, if not non existant.<br />

Here's another tome of listing, I really haven't went through it all, but it seems halfway decent.<br />

I haven't read all the FAQs on the offical website yet, nor the moorgard listings yet. Too busy keeping up with SWG changes and EQ debates while squeezing in time to actually play EQ. I still love EQ, but I guess its just getting old for me. EQ is by far the longest I've played any game, or had the same hobby for that matter. I'm hoping EQ2 will address some of the gameplay issues that reared its head after playing for so long. I'll actually be surprised if EQ2 holds a candle to the polish that EQ has compared to other MMOs. I tried SWG, and while fun at first, the PvP centric design got to me. Atleast, I think that was the biggest factor. I'm hoping the space expansion will breath new life into the game. however, even them I'm not sure I will come back. After DAoC, AO, Horizons, Shadowbane, Planetside, and a long passion for EQ, I actually find myself excited about a new game for once, which is usually rare for me.<br />
<br />
In short though, I really really hope EQ2 kicks as much ass as EQ did when I first started, added plus will be if it holds my attention for more than a month or two.</div></div><hr />
