I'm just curious, I have one or two warriors that ask for DS constantly and a few others that never want it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Buffing (depending on the mobs) can take as few as four slots - haste, Brells, Virtue, and Focus or more slots than I've got - especially if I'm not just focusing on survival but trying to do as high DPS as I can manage (as pathetic as that is compared to DPS classes).<br />
<br />
Ya, the new DS buffs are nice and I use them about half the time.<br />

Generally, I like to have one, but I'm not going to use it instead of Brell's.<br />
<br />
I always use my right clicky Coldain damage shield when I get debuffed to try to protect more valuable stuff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">10-13-2004, 10:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd imagine that you do more DPS with the damage shields rather then using whatever the newest dps buffs are (besides haste, of course).</div></div><hr />

<br />
But pretty much yeah a 420pt DS would be insane, even with 4 hits limit it's 1680 damage  woot! Best part is it's not affected by Defensive  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">10-13-2004, 10:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good god that's a large DS...stacks with everything too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fuzzee</div><div class="date">10-13-2004, 11:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">for 18 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dima</div><div class="date">10-13-2004, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, only 4 hits.<br />
A lot of mages chain casting that on you would do some serious DPS though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">10-14-2004, 03:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So basically, an indirect 1680 nuke for 300 mana that cant crit or have its damage modified.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And can't be resisted, and is virtually aggroless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">10-14-2004, 06:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the DS is aggroless but who knows is casting it is aggroless ?<br />
afterall healling the MT generate aggro so why would give 1680 unresistible domage to the MT be aggro less ?<br />
the normal DS (that last a long time) are cast on inc thus before being on aggro list so it has no impact on the aggro generation, but during a fight ? I wounder if a mage chain casting this 420DS would get splatch or not ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilzalot</div><div class="date">10-14-2004, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I generally always use DS.  With CoR, Mask clicky, Mage DS, and a bard in group.. I can get well over 200 DS on me which has to do decent DPS... especially when it's a mob that hits hella fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varalla</div><div class="date">10-14-2004, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always made room for a good DS in the past.<br />
I didnt know there were people who disliked them *L*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because I've used this in a certain MPG trial, and it worked great, and against a certain unslowed mob, it was pretty killer dps considering that against this certain mob I was doing 0 melee dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Whenever I'm MT I always ask for whatever DS I can get...the extra damage from each hit adds up very quickly.<br />
<br />
Note:  I do the same for xp groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stehle</div><div class="date">10-14-2004, 10:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like most people use it on raids, which is good to know.<br />
<br />
As for Pyrilen Skin, it is a 420 pt DS that lasts for 4 hits or 18 seconds (whichever happens first).<br />
<br />
As a mage, if I cast it on you I do get added to the aggro list, but it is really really low.<br />
<br />
One mage can't chain cast this on a tank, there is a 3 sec cast time and a 10 sec reuse time.  Obviously if there was a mob that was totally nuke resistant and you had more than 2 mages in the guild-- you could set up some sort of DS &quot;chain&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">10-14-2004, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I &lt;3 damage sheilds</div></div><hr />

And across Norrath you will hear mages scream in denial as the news spreads :<br />
<br />
Raid Leader : You !<br />
Magician : Who me ?<br />
Raid Leader : Yes, you mage !<br />
Magician : What is the problem ?<br />
Raid Leader : You will be part of this raid's DS rotation !<br />
Magician : Noooooooooo !!!!!<br />
<br />
And then they shall hunt you down and give you many wedgies for mentioning this atrocy to the warriors !  Even your pets will turn on you in disdain of what you have done.  :D  :p</div></div><hr />
