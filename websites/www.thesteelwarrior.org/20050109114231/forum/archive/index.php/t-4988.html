<br />
=============================================<br />
<br />
Oh, yay! I've been wanting to blow off some steam for some time now. There's a lot of stuff that people do constantly that have eaten away at my temper over the years.<br />
<br />
1. People who have to announce it to their guild, friends and the entire zone EVERY SINGLE time they level. When it's a milestone level that gets you an uber new ability or popular spell, that's fine, but what I call &quot;ding spam&quot; is easily one of the most frustrating little things in EQ. Paludal caverns is a nightmare, because you can level every ten minutes in there. I turn off /ooc and /shout when in PC for whatever reason.<br />
<br />
2. People who can't seem to comprehend the use of the /lfg tag. This goes both ways. You either have dumbasses that spam the zone every five seconds looking for a group (and they never put their tag on) or you have dumbasses that spam the zone asking; &quot;who all is lfg?&quot; While I think you need certain expansions to actually open the lfg/lfp window, I seem to recall that simple /lfg tagging came out way back around Velious. There's no reason beyond willful stupidity for so many people to overlook the use of the /lfg tag, or do a /who and see who in the zone is lfg. What's even worse is when you put your /lfg tag on AND do an /ooc or /shout saying you're looking for a group, and two seconds later the same jackass who was spamming the zone before still asks if anyone is looking for a group. Which leads to the next complaint.<br />
<br />
3. People who won't say that they want a specific class/level when they continuously do zonewide inquiries asking who is lfg. This increases the spam from the people who have been trying to get a group, because the group seeking players ignores them due to their class/level and keeps on spamming. If you want a cleric, say so. If you want a wizard, say so. Or, stop spamming and do a /who to see if any of the classes you want are even in the zone or lfg.<br />
<br />
4. Monks that demand autosplit to be off (in casual groups, not ldon or raid groups). This makes it hard for the people who spend most of their time medding to break even, especially clerics, who are expected to cast hp spells which cost components. It's no fun to race the warrior for loot scraps everytime a mob falls (no offence, but I've found that for some reason, warriors are the loot whores of the group about 75% of the time). If the monk can't stand destroying copper/silver whatnot, then the group needs to figure out a fair way to distribute the loot, so that everyone can buy the supplies and/or spells they need. Which leads me to my next complaint;<br />
<br />
5. Warriors who speed-loot mobs before they even hit the ground. Yes, there are other classes that do this (usually melee), but even when EQ first came out, warriors were the worst about it. Maybe because they never have to worry about mana or songs or even health in a group...I'm not sure why so many warriors are so greedy. Here's a tip: sharing loot benifits everyone. It helps the cleric afford the stones so that they can give you those hp buffs you crave, it helps the shaman buy the attribute buffing spells you constantly spam them for. The worst case I've ever seen was a warrior who told me I had to buy some mage words that dropped in our group. He was looting everything in sight, and when I asked for one little thing that I needed for research, he told me he'd sell it to me. I told him to fuck off and solo, if that was how he was going to be, and I kicked him out of the group.<br />
<br />
6. People who are too lazy to put one or two more letters in a word to spell it properly. If someone is flooding me with &quot;Plz, thnx, u, 4, h8t, etc&quot; then I will put them on ignore...unless they are just learning how to type. Most of the time that isn't the case, and people are just lazy.<br />
<br />
7. People who think that you owe them all of your time when you stop by their hunting group and throw a few buffs on them to be nice. I actually had some little punk cuss my druid out the other day because the warrior in his group died while I was afk. He was pissed off that I didn't just pee in a cup so that I could be their healing bitch (people forget sometimes that other players are actual human beings and still have body functions and require nourishment). The moral of the story is, if someone helps you out of kindness, don't take that to mean that they have any obligation to stay around and keep helping you. Be thankful for the free buffs and don't whine if you pull more than you can handle and the benefactor isn't around to pull your arse out of the fire.<br />
<br />
8. people that bitch about clerics taking a few swings in a fight now and then. No, they aren't going to do big damage even with their summoned hammer or a delightful orb, but they have a right to do more than sit and heal over and over again if they can still do their primary job while meleeing a little bit. <br />
<br />
9. Clerics who are so interested in meleeing that they forget they're the healer and don't do their jobs. These people should have made a paladin if they wanted a full-fledged &quot;battle cleric&quot;. Nobody wants a cleric in the group that thinks they're Conan or Xena. Meleeing is fine and dandy, but when you can't do your job right, it's time to sit on your ass, med, and pay attention to people's health.<br />
<br />
10. Druids and wizards who quad kite inconsiderately. I don't mind someone quadding for exp/loot, but when they monopolize a zone and make it impossible for anyone else to get exp or money, or when they run their mobs over other people, it's time for them to be banned. There's no reason in the world why quad-kiting should cause zone disruption, if the kiter knows what the hell they're doing and has some manners.<br />
<br />
Well, that's it. There's plenty more, but those are the top ten things that have been bothering me almost as long as EQ has been live.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for letting me get that off my chest.<br />

<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
Xylune, you seriously need to go to a server you have never been to and create a Warrior and attempt to lvl him. You have the most one sided argument there I have ever seen. I would go into detail about how bogus your post is, but it would be useless. You need to go where you have no friends and no ubber chars to twink a new char with and try and play a warrior. We have no abilty to solo little own quad and we have no ability to make plat out side of paying through the nose to level up trade skills. On top of that we do have to pay for rezs and certain buffs and it is not your 20 - 30 plat for extended c-3 either. I think you need to put on the warriors shoes for 65 odd levels + AAs and see how you feel about us then.<br />

<br />
He is a Cleric/Druid who likes to melee(8) and ninja AFK(7) and boggle how others won't take it lightly after dying cos he forgot/choose not to heal, specially if there's another healer/cleric in group(9).<br />
<br />
Hates other quading classes who can do their job better than himself(10) and make him go LFG(2) and have to wait for group that sometimes will not happen(3) and therefore not level as fast as others who on top of it boast it loud(1).<br />
<br />
All because, he whines every single time about people who do not share his taste for perfect phrase building skills(6) and most of all, for not being able to loot as fast as he would like(5), specially when he is busy healing and split is off(4).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh .. I also play a Cleric, and I have to admit that to a cleric, the Tier 1 POP planes are really horrendous on loot. Things were good with Sebilis and such zones and those 4 pp items quickly add up and the 50+ pp items were wonderful ... but to hunt in zones with zero loot drops hurts - And not just for the Cleric either. And getting groups to go to Sebilis is almost impossible nowadays.<br />
<br />
I have tried being completely out of pp on ALL of my characters, so I could buy peridots, that's no fun. But that's also very rare. Usually, there's a small surplus in Tier 2+ planes in most cases, and sometimes a big surplus of pp, so things are good again. LDoN is also good.<br />
<br />
-however-<br />
<br />
I'm dismayed at the prices on many warrior items.<br />
Cobalt Bracer, anyone ? Or the BP perhaps ?<br />
Not to mention LDoN items.<br />
Knights have it good.</div></div><hr />

I'd have to say pretty much the only thing I outright disagree with him on is #4. &quot;Commie looting&quot; is becoming much more popular with LDoN even among pickup groups. It's really not that hard to have one person loot everything with autosplit split off, then vendor the trash loot and /split everything before disbanding. <br />
<br />
I've actually seen a couple of higher level (56+) clerics melee full time and still do their jobs effectively. With Yaulp V and VI, they can regen just a couple mana less per tick while meleeing than sitting. <br />
<br />
As for warriors specifically being loot whores, I don't know about that, but I do know that I've had multiple pickup exp groups in DSP on alts where I had to start ninja looting from the other melees (not just warriors) just so I could give the casters a brick of acrylia now and then... and this was AFTER myself and the casters asking the other melees more than once to leave some ore for the casters.</div></div><hr />

Don't forget to /poke the casters to move their duffs and get it ... I usually am looting just to clear the corpses near my feet.  The peeps I usually group with are good about splitting and tossing karma around, so even if somebody ends up ahead or in the hole one night, over time we all do well.</div></div><hr />

Hehe they literally didn't have the chance. I honestly don't remember what classes the other melees were (not that it's relevant), but they were literally looting before the bodies hit the floor. :)<br />
<br />
Most times in general though yeah, things are relatively close to what I'd consider fair. You get your good groups, and you get your selfish retards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
:P<br />
<br />
More copper for all of us!<br />
<br />
&quot;Warriors who speed-loot mobs before they even hit the ground.&quot;<br />
<br />
And all the other stuff that's being said about fast looters and loot freaks ... it's not just warriors. In fact, I've met a LOT of people who do that. Being a monk, you tend NOT to loot (can't loot while chain pulling for instance). And I really don't give a crap one way or the other. BUT, I will say this ... it's not just warriors who do that. I've met rogues, druids, shamans, clerics, wizards, and warriors who all do that.<br />
<br />
Monks on the whole don't. But that's cause it's a pavlovian repsonse NOT to loot after dealing with 14 stone weight limit for 50 some odd levels.<br />
<br />
The speed looting never bugs me.<br />
<br />
What bugs me is the fact that the SPLIT never comes. I mean jeeeeezis h. whatever ... I spend two hours watching you tank up on vendor drops in this mini-adventure, and you're NOT splitting AT LEAST some of the loose coins with us? That's rude.<br />
<br />
Split the damn plat/gold/silver/copper. Take your damn vendor loot, replenish your damn dots, and chill.<br />
<br />
&quot;Druids and wizards who quad kite inconsiderately. &quot;<br />
<br />
I never once encountered the problems this person did with kiters. They never bugged me in Befallen. They were strangely absent in Najena. I couldn't find them in Runnyeye, Sol A, Sol B. OR Lower Guk. They weren't in Velks. They weren't in Seb. They weren't in KC. They weren't in Howling Stones.<br />
<br />
Sure all those zones had problems of their own.<br />
<br />
But I gotta tell ya ... when soloing orcs in Crystal Caverns, the LAST thing on my mind was &quot;Is that druid who just ran by going to steamroll me with a quad kite?&quot;<br />

Casters (priests are included in this) who bitch and moan that they are getting beaten on early in fights who simultaneously demand you leave a pile of corpses in front of you so they dont' get 'shortchanged' on plat (even though in LDoN/PoP, you're guaranteed far more than dot cost compensation in any group you're in with a SINGLE trash item), so that you dont' appear to be &quot;looting corpses before they hit the floor&quot; when you're trying to make it easier to target incoming mobs so their fucking pansy bitch asses don't get beat on.<br />

Seems everyone I know is trying to make a signet of might, including myself. After a year or more of not really giving a rat's ass about plat, I find myself paying attention again.

<br />
whats up with people farming mobs 40 levels below them for cash? the cash isnt that great. i for one farm dark blues and make much more cash than he can and get experience besides. there were 3 or 4 farmers that day and that day was typical. get a life people! ive noticed the farmers are always in their 50-60 level range. and this is strange because there are a whole lot more 65s in the game than there are the entire range of 50-60. but the explanation is clear. people in their 50s who get hung up on green farming never get to 65 because they dont get experience.<br />

get off the spider silk farming guys and start playing the game again.<br />

this isnt as bad as the hill giant farmers. somewhere there is this perception that hill giants drop a lot of coin. but in my experience that coin is mainly copper and fine steel weapons. yet people fight over the hill giants like it was something uber. no wonder people get stuck in their low 50s.<br />

for those who want to tell me that you cant make money except on greens my 61 toon can consistently make an aa AND 6000 plat in loot in about 2 1/2 hours. and he doesnt do that on greens. he does it by farming dark blues.<br />

 A lot of people farm the spider silk so they can get tailoring up and do things like the shawls, which improve characters that use mana a hell of a lot. But it takes a goodly number to get your skillups, and you can't/shouldn't piss away your money buying it at the inflated prices in the bazaar.<br />

 Screw all that, my bard kills spiders too. He's just bright enough to avoid EK when he does it.</div></div><hr />

If you know a better way to increase the tradeskills that require these items (part of &quot;playing the game&quot; as you say) then we're all ears.</div></div><hr />

What server are you on Phantron, and is everything there priced so high?</div></div><hr />
