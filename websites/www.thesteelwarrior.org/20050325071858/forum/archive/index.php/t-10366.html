Currently my war has 156 str 94 agi 210 sta unbuffed. Is this ratio ok? I'm addicted to agi potions, anything that raises the crit %. Strength adds more damage to all hits. Please advice or post your stats. Thanks~</div></div><hr />

Agi is nice for crit rate, but having a high str affects your shield block amount, as well as your average rage generation without relying on crits (This is important to me, since the RNG is a bastard.)  <br />
<br />
I'm working on tweaking my agi a bit higher as I recently respec'd over to arms/prot/fury.</div></div><hr />

worth it ? the crit rate raises good enough ?<br />
its possible to raise ur crit rate around 30% ?? :confused: <br />
<br />
and also.. how much crit rate raises by agility point and by char lv ? *raping my calculator*  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
thanks in advance for answers.. my calc would be grateful  :D</div></div><hr />

If that is true; than go for Agility as primary stat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, that formula only works for rogues and hunters.  Unless you're saying the +% crit increase is equal to the amount of damage on average that strength gear provides.<br />
<br />
At lvl 60 I think someone figured it was about 30 points of agi gear for 1% of crit. It's on a sliding scale, that goes up as you level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not in warrior land it doesn't.  Agi affects crit %, dodge and armor.  Rogues and possibly hunters (not sure on hunters) are lucky bastards and get a dps boost from it, we however, do not.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-23-2005, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">str - increased damage and block mitigaiton<br />
agi - increased luck on crits and avoidance<br />
<br />
both are good 2ndary stats.  seems like you get about the same benifit either way depending on what it is you want.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I take what ever piece of gear has the most sta and raw AC provided it has one or both of those stats on it as the other stat.  I've ended up with a lot more str than agi just by dumb luck I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rodocite</div><div class="date">01-24-2005, 02:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i try to keep 20% crit. i put all my agi into the non ac gears since plates really only have sta or str. <br />
<br />
though i try to keep it balanced, stat wise, i think my order of priority is sta, str, agi while considering increasing AC.<br />
<br />
sta is our most important stat if we want to see any grouping action at all, hands down.<br />
str is important for all our skills and just general damage. dont start ignoring it. <br />
agi for us doesnt increase raw dps. like has been said before, it increases crit rate, armor rating and dodge rate. i think crit rate and dodge rate increase at the same amount. im not sure. with our crit skills however, its fairly easy to get 20% crit.<br />
<br />
ive been thinking of having grinding/farming gear that just consists of agi/str in addition to my normal gear which balances out the stats. any of you do this? id like to know if its worth the cost.<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh yeah, and i find that keeping your ac a little above 40% mitigation with no shield and close to or above 50% mitigation WITH a shield works well. of course, warriors with protection talents wont have a problem doing this.<br />
<br />
i think were really all about balance if we want to play with other peeps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">01-24-2005, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Consider this. With 115 str 110 agi I was doing crits of like 230 with my whirlwind weapon against ogres in badlands. Now with 180 str 80 agi my heroic strike hits for 200 atleast (and can crit upto 500) against those ogres. MS can crit for upto 500 too and otherwise my normal crits can go upto 375 or 400+ if I have a pally in my group (makes my attack power 710). That's why I'm going str as a secondary stat. Why not hit as much harder than with lower strength and still have the chance to crit, though a bit less often. Dodge is unreliable. AC and stamina are much more reliable for defense. At level 45, using an elixir of greater agility gives 25 agility, making it 105 agi from 80 and increases damage reduction for a meager 0.6%. So damage reduction from agility is not as it works in warcraft 3 or Diablo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tinuvas</div><div class="date">01-25-2005, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is some info here:<br />
<br />
http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-warrior&amp;t=38845&amp;tmp=1#post38845<br />
<br />
The gist of that thread seems to be that strength is better than agility when talking about sustained DPS increases.  I haven't done any parsing to validate the info, but it seems reasonable.  There are, of course, mitigating factors to be taken into account when deciding what you want to focus on.<br />
<br />
It seems to be accepted (on those boards at least) that the following are true at 60:<br />
<br />
1 Strength = 2 Attack Power<br />
14 Attack Power = 1 DPS<br />
1 Agility = +.04% change to crit/dodge<br />
<br />
Agility appears to become less effective as your level goes up, with strength being the inverse.<br />
<br />
I generally look for strength on my gear, but I won't turn down agility where I can get it.  Since I don't PVP currently and spend the majority of my time in instances (with a shield) or duoing with a healer, burst DPS is less appealing than sustained for the majority of my gameplay.  Depending on how my playtime is spent when I cap, I may start going more balanced or even towards agility.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">01-25-2005, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">increasing your agility is a scary thing when combined with +crit items and talents. I can see a pally go down if you lead with a Charge, get a couple lucky rolls on crits, then Shield Bash (even better if it's Imp)/Pummel/Conc Blow/Slam as needed.</div></div><hr />

Supposedly this is a bug...we shall see.  I, as a Shaman, would LOVE to see this &quot;fixed/adjusted&quot;.  BG, here we come!</div></div><hr />
