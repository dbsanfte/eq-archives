I'm not really uptodate on Berserker power levels, but from what I have seen it sounds like they are basically a warrior with +20% dps, but stripped of boss-mob tanking ability?<br />
<br />
Anyone know any other redeeming factors about this class, which could be usefull for high-end raids?<br />
<br />
I know I could ask this on a berserker board, but I would prefer the cold hard truth ;). Its my impression that the berserker class is basically useless atm, but please enlighten me if I am wrong.</div></div><hr />

I'd suggest picking up and cultivating one or two simply for the high likelyhood they will be improved in some fundamental way that will increase raid power. Right now, everything says that they're ass though!</div></div><hr />

You are missing the magic that is a Berserker though, they have fantastic aggro abilities so trying to get mobs off them in raids can be challenging.  Our guilds Berserker loves to tank adds for our raid even though he shouldnt be.  I love the red con ones, Berserker goes splat on those (damn, I should have been an SK).<br />

If it's the same encounters I'm thinking of, the random class you need is limited to the classes actually present.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Send them off to go farm tradeskill items.<br />
<br />
I hear their new AAs are all going to involve different methods of summoning no rent tradeskill 250 trivial items for the sake of bringing more utility to the guild.</div></div><hr />

Waste of dev time, as their abilities were all pieced from what at one time was being summized and brainstormed for existing classes to recieve.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 04:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;they have a discipline which allows the group they are in to break the haste cap or something of the effect.... &quot;<br />
<br />
Monks already have that discipline. And it does indeed work best with a bard song as you suggest. But, still, it's not a compelling reason for having a zerker around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 04:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">morover none of the disc with a group effect (like those overhates from berserkers) can't be used if somebody in the group is disced, and if the serker can and then use it, this will prevent anybody in the group to use his own disc while under the effect of the serker disc.<br />
this sure don't help them ... <br />
<br />
<br />
Note : disc overhaste (from monk and berserker) don't stack with bard overhaste, so you can use one or the other, not both. and if I remember disc overhaste is far less than 30% , something like 10 or 15%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 08:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Although I too think Berserkers have no real &quot;best thing&quot; role (and that they were probably severely crippled by the scrapping of the &quot;opening system&quot;), in any given case I think a guild should ask itself a few questions:<br />
1. Is it ever the case that you could fit an extra dps hand in a raid?<br />
2. Is the player playing the Zerker good?<br />
3. Does the zerker require little if any backflagging?<br />
4. Does the player's personality fit with those of people already in the guild?<br />
<br />
If the answers to all four questions are yes, then you might want to hesitate to reject his application merely because at the moment berserkers don't seem to do anything &quot;the best.&quot; Very soon players will have 5 new levels, there will be a new expansion, and SOE has been asking warriors what new AAs they might want. It's possible, of course, that berserkers will get no love at all for years, but it's also possible that they'll get something at some point that will make them fairly handy.<br />
<br />
And, heh, whoever this guy is, he must be awfully relentless if he's still playing a zerker.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's the very first description of the power, offered by Rytan, waaaaaay back when:<br />
<br />
&quot;Speed Focus - 100 hands upgrade, increase your melee speed independent of haste effects.&quot;<br />
<br />
Here's a recent thread with a nice chart showing how it looks:<br />
<br />
http://p201.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=46755.topic<br />
<br />
Speed Focus, 100 Hands, and the Zerker thing all work pretty much the same. The more haste you have, the better it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Equirs</div><div class="date">08-14-2004, 05:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's an event later in the GoD game which requires you to have a specific class to kill a certain mob. That includes a beserker. :) <br />
<br />
That aside... Look past the class, and if he's a nice guy, recruit him. No loss in having a beserker in your guild. And only potential gain.<br />
<br />
Edit. <br />
<br />
The beserker in our guild got this tomb that summons him a bunch of this <br />

Back on topic.  I haven't had much exp with higher lvl Zerkers.  I hear they put out decent DPS and I'm sure at some point they'll be given some raid usefullness.  I wouldn't be against adding one to the roster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) WS pulling.  They get about 18 seconds of bard like speed and a super WS disc that renders them unhittable as well as having the ability to hold awesome aggro at that time.<br />
<br />
This saves you rangers you'd normally have die......so they can DPS for the raid.<br />
<br />
2) stun.  Yeah their stun owns.  So does their aggro ganking if used correctly<br />
<br />
3) otherwise they're just pretty lights and big axes.</div></div><hr />

If SoE sticks true to form...when Zerkers are overhauled they will be a very nice, well rounded class (over-powered).  Would be nice to have a couple decent ones on the roster for when that happens.  <br />
<br />
We'll see.</div></div><hr />
