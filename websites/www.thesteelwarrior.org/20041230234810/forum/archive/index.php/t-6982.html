<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apokolipse</div><div class="date">05-04-2004, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all,<br />
<br />
Just wanted to post this question to seek advice.  I have a 62 war, toting a sotbs with anger II and a chos on the backhand.  Aggro has not been a problem since I got the berate tome back at 56.  <br />
<br />
However, I was in PoM the other night and a level 50 froglok warrior kept stealing aggro from me, ALL NIGHT!!  He swore up and down that he wasn't taunting, but I find it hard to believe.  He was using the same weapons only he had the chos in the mainhand.  Neither one had an aug yet.<br />
<br />
IF, that's a big if, IF he wasn't taunting, then how on earth did I lose aggro to a level 50?  Do the PoM mobs hate Frogloks?  I was using berate, procing my weapons with my dex at 265 ( NDT ) and using slam(bash), discarm, taunt etc... and every time he walked up to the mobs they turned on him.  It just didn't make sense to me.  Looking for an excuse other than....&quot; I lack &quot;   LOL.  <br />
<br />
The only difference was he had his chos on the front.  I used to use that on the front but the stun only works on low level mobs, and the planar strike stun works on mobs up to 65, so I switched and put the sotbs on the main hand and chose to aug that with AngerII.  Was that a mistake?   I plan to get the cord hilted spike driver next and put Anger III on it for my mainhand and offhand the sotbs with Anger II.  But is the chos that much better than the sotbs?  I reallize the chos has the same proc as the gbos, which seems to be popular for aggro.  But I felt my sotbs was more productive on the mainhand than my chos.  Where did I go wrong?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

Your Froglok friend was drawing low-level aggro. Don't give up on your weapon combo.</div></div><hr />

I've seen on countless occasions when 2 warriors are grouped it seem like it turns into a pissin match.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
When im in the situation where me and another warrior are grouped and were both the same level with both the relitave same agro tools to our disposal, and the other warrior wants to keep having a pissin match with me, i'll let him MT its no sweat off my brow. As for me if i dont want agro, i know how &quot;not&quot; to get it.</div></div><hr />

either the mob was rooted or he was taunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">05-04-2004, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I remember reading somewhere that the chos is slightly better aggro than sotbs, but it isnt good enough to account for that.  As was previously stated either the mobs were rooted, or the frog was taunting just to be a jerk.  Although lower levels do tend to get aggro'd because of the &quot;easy target&quot; thing, it shouldnt be that bad most of the time, at least from my experience.</div></div><hr />

Happened a LOT when i was tanking for my friends paladin twink in Valor....<br />
And she wasnt taunting / stunning , because we played near each other IRL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nokatsu</div><div class="date">05-04-2004, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Proximity to the mob can help a lot. Stay right in the mobs face and you will lose aggro less often. Stun weapons have some knockback so you need to keep moving in on the mob. Ask the lower level warrior to try to stay at maximum melee range.</div></div><hr />

Disarm doesn't give you more agro, it just makes the mob agro you once if you aren't already on the hate list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">05-04-2004, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Low level aggro definitely happens.  When my cleric bot was 50-something it was not at all unusual for a mob on a raid to forsake all others long enough to turn him into a grease spot even though he was just standing there minding his own business.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">05-04-2004, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the level of the mob depends also. I can pull all of guk dead side from just running by them with my 65 war and hit furious, then i can bring my 44 cleric in and AE them non stop and not get agro. Maybe because they are blue cons?<br />
I know for sure that on high level boss mobs they tend to wipe the floor with lower levels first before they fixate on me. (level 46 rogue on behemoth raid lol)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DG-Slider</div><div class="date">05-04-2004, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that low-level aggro happens. The other day I was in BoThunder and a 62-63 shammy kept yanking aggro with his spells, especially if I didn't get an early proc with my baby rattle. I even switched to a CHoS just for the extra aggro. The 65 druid and 65 ench were both doing their thing as well and the giants never looked at them. I am convinced it wa shis level coming into play and he wasn't as close as me, the ranger, or the bard. /shrug</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coroq</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, low level aggro is real, see Emilia's post, that should seal it for you. If you really want to draw aggro from another warrior in your group, just sit, then the mob treats you like you are level 1 or so, of course the side effect is that the mob will hit you for max.<br />
<br />
Also 2 handers have huge aggro ever since they upped their damage bonus before PoP came out, so you need 2 damn fine aggro 1-handers to beat a decent 2hander.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lathen</div><div class="date">05-06-2004, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think that the research of the gurus on this board support that conclusion, Coroq. Feel free to chime in and support or disagree!<br />
<br />
The proc rate of the 2h weapon would be lower than the combined proc rate of the two 1h weapons a dual wielding warrior had equipped. If we assume that each of those weapons has 2 procs, then the dual wielding warrior is going to be drawing much more aggression from his more-frequently-firing anger procs than the warrior who's using a 2hander.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coroq</div><div class="date">05-06-2004, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lathen, you just repeated my conclusion  :)  I consider a weapon with a high aggro proc aug'd with ang3 to be &quot;damn fine&quot;, and getting 2 of them isn't always real easy.<br />
<br />
But in general, if the 2-hander you have is of similar or greater quality than your 1-handers, it's better aggro (in addition to the obvious better dps and fewer ripost). I'm talking for instance of a typical warrior that weilds a BoC + minor PoP weapon (say, cord hilted) then goes elemental and gets a BoW. Yes with dual weilding you get a bonus of about 50% more procs thanks to your offhand swings, but you lose out a lot on steady dps aggro. The offhand gets fewer swings and smaller damage bonus, and as others have shown on this board the &quot;potential damage&quot; of your offhand is weighted artificially small. So the BoW is the best aggro option until you start getting weapons from tier4 of time and beyond where there a few &quot;damn fine&quot; 1 handers.</div></div><hr />

Yes, it was low lev aggro.. 100%.</div></div><hr />

With WA5, proc aggro has become a bigger slice of the total aggro pie, and the importance of DPS aggro has therefore diminished.  It seems to me that WA5 favors the setup that relies the most on procs, which is the dual wield setup.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you have a bloodfrenzy or darkblade w/ anger3, i'm pretty convinced that 1h/shield + imbue &gt; any 2h weapon in the game ;/<br />
should tweak the usefulness of 2h weapons imo</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 01:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure at what level difference it kicks in at but I have seen it. My wife has a 53 cleric alt. I was grouping with her and my 65 Shammy in PoI. Pull with arrow, incite on the way in, Shaman slows and dots. Occasionally mobs still take a swing at the 53 cleric on a lizard without her doing anything but sitting there polishing her nails. No heals stuns etc. With me at 64 the level difference is 11 so I know it does exist with that much difference.<br />
<br />
<br />
When I was lvl 62 was grouped in PoV in the cave. (Called Inner on Luclin) Main tank was a 65 war and I was low lvl in group and never seem to catch any aggro because of level. So I assume that 3 levels difference is not enough to effect things.</div></div><hr />

I was in Karnor's basement pulling skellies, hands, and dogs and whether or not my level 50 cleric was sitting they always went for him, even if i attacked the mob at the spawn point until i got some procs off and pulled him back. I went to Sebilis and NEVER got low level agro. In fact, I could chain nuke at 99% with my warrior having plinked just 1 arrow. Note: both zones I pulled with an arrow and then hit incite.<br />
<br />
So it may be issues with zones or type of mobs? who knows. PoJ I don't get low level agro, PoI I don't get low level agro either.</div></div><hr />

Yes, it was low lev aggro.. 100%.<br />

Everything in CoM has undead agro, meaning they will hit whatever is closest unless someone far away has tons of agro, like 2000 or something. CoM is one of the best places to plevel with dmg shields because of this, you can pull 4 mobs nonstop training the person being power levelled.<br />
<br />
Alot of stuff in karnors basement is undead too, and the hole if youre in deep. Agro range is higher the lower level you are I think but theres no agro adjustment or bonus other than the initial agro bonus I would think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 07:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aha never thought about undead agro since they are pretty much mindless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, since a bit before GoD CoM was revamped.. alot less undead in there now... and none in the main PL spots at front or in temple, there are still some shades mixed in now and then but those I usualy avoid while pling at lower levs. There is still some undead in the stables area and some in the two balconies and a few around the reavers area... but thats it for downstairs... mostly its &quot;Raving Lunatics&quot; and &quot;Lost Souls&quot; now which are like dsert madmen hehe. <br />
<br />
It is still a great place to PL as even these things do not run.. but they are not undead either.</div></div><hr />
