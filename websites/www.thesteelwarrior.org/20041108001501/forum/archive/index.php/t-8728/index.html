<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Crathsor Gnawbones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This I got a laugh out of -<br />
<br />
Mostly I am talking about PoP mobs, like Diaku on the way to the zeks, Kings in the CoDb. They are using Obsidian blades of War, BoCs, CHoS, LDoN augmented gear. This is a problem that has developed very recently. I have played with aggro alot, trying to see what I can do. I am not that new to the class, the issue I am having is that I am nuking and gettting aggro when I KNOW that I should not get aggro. If I am hitting a Diaku Raider at 85% with a draught and getting summoned and killed something is very wrong. <br />
<br />
One other questions this is killing me, I have gotten into an argument with a monk in the guild who insists that this is all my fualt. This Monk is telling me that the role of a Wizard is not DPS, and we should not be out damaging everyone on the raid. I have been told that no one should out damage the MT, to me this is incredible, I don't even know who to not out damage the MT without meleeing. Is this right, or does this sound crazy to anyone else?<br />
<br />
Here's the link to where this was found - http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=wizardbalance&amp;message.id=1256&amp;no_redir=true <br />
<br />
Personally from reading this, I believe the monk is an idiot.  Tanks role is to maintain aggro first, DPS comes secondary.<br />
<br />
A wizard's job is to out damage us...not out aggro us.  Out aggro'n comes into play, but its knowing who your tank is and their limitations.  May have one tank where the wizard can chain cast Strike of Soluesk, but get another and cast it once the wizard has immediate aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The monk is an idiot. Tanks role is agro like you said. That agro is produced through agro discs, agro procs, and least effectively through DPS. More DPS does increase our agro, but it is the least effective of 3 by far. The ammount of agro that the MT can sustain does limit the amount of DPS that the other raid members can do, but its not from his DPS.<br />
<br />
Yes, wizards are master burst dps class. That is thier main function. Like I said, the monk is a blithering idiot. If you are waiting for the tank to build agro and then using a agro reducing spell like daught then you shouldn't be getting agro. This sound similar to the necro problem with crit dots giving instant agro. I suggest you take this to the wizard board (not the SOE forums, they suck, Gemdiver's board is the wizard board) and talk it over with them as they will be better able to help you understand what is going on.<br />
<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, look at the content the guy is &quot;testing&quot; his aggro in.  They have Tier 3 + LDoN, and the wizard sounds to be a newb himself, If as a caster, you can't survive tactics mobs....... Looks like newbs meet Everquest for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, lets welcome every post post here at TSW with elitism. Three cheers to snobish know-it-alls.<br />

Problem is that this behavior isn't in-line with his past experience. How about adressing that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Based off what?  I see no study as to prove his theories.  There could be a number of factors that would account for this.<br />
<br />
The tank might have taken off his has item.<br />
The tank might have forgotten to have activeated his tribute haste.<br />
It's probably not the same tank each time, different tanks mean different levels of AA and weapons.  The tank with the OSoW and a BoC are going to well outperform the CHoS/SotBS.<br />
An enchanter could be casting AE memblur, or, a deaggro spell on the tank.<br />
Proximity of the tank to the mob, and the wizard to the mob.<br />
It could also be the level ranges of the mobs vs the wizard and tank.<br />
<br />
I believe the post was made for us to get a laugh, which I did.  Not to answer someones questions as to &quot;why they shouldn't be getting aggro when they KNOW they shouldn't, but do&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sargasso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In this particular case, I have to say that the Warrior is not doing his job correctly in Tactics.<br />
While I do also play a warrior, my main is a 65 wiz...draughts are low damage quick casting DD spells with a minus 50 to resist check...they are not aggro taking nukes...you should be able to nuke practically ANYTHING with a draught at 85% and never even sniff aggro from the mob.<br />
<br />
Tank must have been using non aggro weapons and no taunt...heck even then I find this amazing that a draught at 85% would cause summoning....<br />
Oddly tho...aggro is a strange thing...<br />
While raiding I have hit a mob with White Fire (yes largest Wizard DD spell) at 45% health and had him summon and squash me....that just doesn't seem right.</div></div><hr />
