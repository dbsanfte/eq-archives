<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bodvar</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 06:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was playing my warrior til lvl 50 when I decided to switch to my main, a SK, and play him instead.  Now that my SK is almost 58 and has epic, I've been thinking of going back to my warrior and maybe making him my main instead.  One of the reasons I switch to begin with was people telling me how warriors cant hold aggro and that they have a difficult time getting groups in PoP since many want a Pally/SK because they can hold aggro better.  I think that this is complete BS though.  I know warriors have to rely on procs to hold aggro but I think than can do as good of a job as any hybrid can.  My question is do you guys have trouble in getting groups in PoP and what in your eyes makes warriors better than SKs/Pallies?</div></div><hr />

Holding aggro for a warrior can be frustrating at times, but if you know what your doing its all the easier.  Stick with the warrior, they are nothing but fun in my book!<br />

I found it hard to believe people didn't want warriors in groups at first, until I asked them.</div></div><hr />

I have handed over the tanking to a pally quite a few times because to be honest it's nice to have a break from tanking now and then.  Hell, since I got level 65 and been hanging out in BoT, about 45% of the groups I have got into have had 2 warriors in them and no sk/pally's.</div></div><hr />

But not due to class IMO, there are just alot of other tank types out there. Only issue is after getting group you get to here about how you can hold agro sometimes, had a real bad night one night, group didnt hold back at all, but they kept badgering me, saying, well maybe your taunt isnt maxed, how do we know what your issue is, and I am no under gear warrior mind you, i am suited quite well. Needless to say I logged and was quite pissed off from the whole situation. This doesnt happen but maybe 50% of the time =\ usually in POP zones. If I do old world I can hold fine because I am a little bigger usually then other i am groupd with by at least a lvl or 4.........</div></div><hr />
