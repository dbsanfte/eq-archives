<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i currently have 237 spent AA's and 7 unspent (which i plan on using for living shield 3) my question is; should i spend any aa's on fluff aa's (is there any reason to?) or should i work on resists or stats (which resists or stats are the best to get first).  My magelo has all the aa's ive spent if you'd like ti check that.(basically all the dps defensive aa's except ambidexterity since i use a 2 hander exclusively).<br />
<br />
Any advice is appreciated</div></div><hr />

After that its all up to you but Warcry and Natural Healing are nice toys.</div></div><hr />

Faster AE taunt would be nice in any situation that you just might use it. You have everything really important, but that may come in handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you probably should have ambidex if you use duel wield more often, i noticed a significant differance when i got it at lvl 60. after that you should probably boost your saves, magic resistance first, since most &quot;odd&quot; effects check against MR. the other saves arent as important, since most other spells that check against elemental saves are usually dots or DDs which are easily countered by an attentive spot healer. anything else you get after that will jsut be for fun, you alraedy have all the important ones.</div></div><hr />
