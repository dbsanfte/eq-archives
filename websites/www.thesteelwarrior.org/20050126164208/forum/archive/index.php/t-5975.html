<br />
As some of you are aware I have recently returned to EQ along with some friends after almost a year of not playing.  It seems alot has changed so there is alot for us to learn/re-learn :)<br />
<br />
We have been mostly doing LDON adventures and find them both fun and rewarding.  We are all around level 61ish so the EXP we get from doing them is not bad regardless if we complete the adv or not. <br />
<br />
Anyhow, my gear is pretty much the same as it was when i left so I am looking for upgrades.  Are their any recommended LDON items bought with ADV points that i should look into?  My playstyle is 99% single group EXPing.  I dont raid, will probably never raid or even get close to seeing any of the higher end dropable gear.  I havent looked much into what items can be bought with ADV points. <br />
<br />
As you can see from my profile, my main aggro weapon is GSOT and my main DPS weapon is WMBS.<br />
<br />
Usual group consists of Me, 61 Druid, 60 Rogue, 61 Pally, and 64 Enchanter.<br />
<br />
Of course our main priority is getting everyone to 65 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zeeko</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ornate armor would be nice if you have the plat to buy it or are willing to wait until all above 62 and manage to camp some in BoT with your group.<br />
Royal attendant armor from the Tak theme is just as good if not better in some slots (arms?).  Save your points for those as they go for 1492, but if you don't raid, that Tak armor is probably end-game armor for you.  Get a piece, and then save the points to aug it with things like 40hp type 2, regen/vengeance/aura of battle type 3, and a random type 1 that you pick up from the regular LDONs. (sta/raw hp/+7 resists are my favorites)<br />
<br />
While you're xping, you should save some plat and upgrade your wedding ring and solstice earring to another valorium ring, and a bloodmetal earring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can't hit magelo from work, so i can't see what you already have, but as interim alternatives to tide you over till you get ornate or LDoN armor, there are several good pieces that drop in Veksar and are easily one groupable at your level.  One piece is the Chestplate of Darkflame.  It's AC 42 and has decent stats (can't hit lucy or allakhazam either), drops off named in the theatre area, just up a really steep ramp past the golems.  The other is kylong shinguards AC34 4sta a few hps and some other stats iirc, drops off the named Feral Lord Somethingorother just past the pool room.  Also, there's the soulscream belt, nice haste item from the shopkeeper in veksar.  All the aforementioned named drop a caster item also iirc, but I never pay much attention to those drops. :)Droga has some nice drops too (CHoS, SotB, haste belt, forget the name), and the xps there are damn nice.  XP's at the earthseer/king camps are almost as good as some tier 2 pop camps, the earthseer is lvl 61 and drops the SotB, the no clue what level the king is since he's permacamped so I never get to kill him. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks,<br />
<br />
I currently have a CoF for haste so i really dont see upgrading haste anytime soon.  Im currently using the Berserker BP (think it has been renamed but i still call it Berserker).<br />
<br />
We have tried a few times to go camp for the Droga weapons but like you said its permacamped. (by solo bards no less) :(  So im not gonna even try anymore.  Ill buy those as time/money permit. But honestly, we have zero aggro problems with me using the good ol GSOT so weapon upgrades are taking a back seat to armor.<br />
<br />
Ive been looking over the LDON armor and as much as I would like the NRO stuff the Everfrost stuff is much more reasonable and realistic for me to get.  Either would be upgrades for me.  Ornate is unrealistic unless i can gather enough cash. <br />
<br />
The mmistake i made before quitting was not being realistic in terms of what i could get and not.  This time around im trying to remain realistic and just have some fun.  <br />
<br />
As always as much advice as I can get from those that know this game the best (i.e Warriors) :) The better i will be :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Miragul's armor is pretty much interchangeable with ornate in most slots (with the proper augs anyway), and way easier for a casual player to get.  Personally, I get more mileage out of my CHoS/SotB combo than I do out of my GSoT, and that was before I anger aug'd the dual wield setup.  Of course, if riposte damage is an issue the decreased aggro of the GSoT is a tradeoff for less spiky damage, and I'm sure my perception of my GSOT will change once I get the offensive AA's that make 2h more damaging.  <br />
Try sneaking into Droga early on a weekend morning.  On my server the king is always camped, but the earthseer never is.  He's good xps, a ridiculously easy kill for his level (61), and last time we did it he dropped the sword 3 out of 4 times we got him to spawn.  Got me a nice offhand weapon, and my guildies about 10k each. :)<br />
That having been said, you're dead right about the GSoT being enough for now if your armor is lacking.  Grind out EF LDoN till you're sick of it (and you will be before you're done) and get some armor and anger augs.  Just keep Droga in mind as a nice change of pace, stellar xps for the difficulty, and an opportunity to snag an upgrade or two along the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 03:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you dont want to buy stuff before you get your ldon point armor. you can do tak and get arcetches bejweled bp and dust girdles of reformed sand for the dd casters and bucled shale belts for the others.<br />
<br />
some decent greaves drop in ruj not sure on caster stuff.<br />
<br />
bb you have ear theirs a +7 all stat ring and chain bp for you chain friends.<br />
<br />
ef has a nice mask and 12 wis caster weapon<br />
<br />
most you can normaly pick up while makeing the runs anyway.<br />
<br />
if you think you can pull it off lvl 60 hards rock and drop much better loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paladiin</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, the Malevolent gear is going to be the best bet if you are doing lots of LDoN.  I'd start with the Greaves and the Boots in your case.  For the price of one Takish piece you can have 2 Miragul's pieces.  And there really aren't too big of differences between them:<br />
<br />
Malevolent Boots:<br />
+31 AC +5 Str +5 Agi +5 Dex +3 vsMg +3 vsFire +3 vsCold +3 vsPos +3 vsDis +55 HP +65 Mana<br />
<br />
Royal Attendant Boots:<br />
+34 AC +5 Sta +6 Agi +4 Wis +4 Int +4 Cha +4 vsMg +4 vsFire +4 vsCold +4 vsPos +4 vsDis +70 HP +80 Mana  <br />
<br />
Difference (raw): 3AC, 5Sta, -5Str, 1Agi, -5Dex, 1Saves, 15hp.<br />
<br />
Malevolent Greaves:<br />
+44 AC +8 Sta +5 Wis +5 Int +8 Cha +10 vsMg +10 vsCold +70 HP +65 Mana <br />
<br />
Royal Attendant Greaves:<br />
+48 AC +10 Str +10 Agi +6 Wis +6 Int +13 vsFire +13 vsDis +85 HP +80 Mana  <br />
<br />
Difference (raw):4ac, -8Sta, +10Str, +10agi, 15hp, -10svm, -10svc, +13 svf, +13svd.<br />
<br />
So not counting saves (which are almost identical in amount, and differ in types) here's what you miss out on going with Malevolent at half the cost on these pieces:<br />
<br />
-7ac, -3sta, -5str, -11agi, +5dex, -30hp.<br />
<br />
So sure, that's a small amount of important stats, but for the cost for where you're at, I'd certainly go with the Malevolent pieces.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the GSoT, I'd agree that I wouldn't stress too much about the Droga weapons.  You'll eventually come across the camp open and pick em up (nice to have a choice of dual wielding and 2H) but until then the GSoT works just fine.  Once you're swimming in LDoN points, you can pick up a Ykesha augment from Guk, or an Anger aug from EF and make it even a stronger agro weapon, but I've tanked BoT with a GSoT+Provoke so it's certainly a nice weapon as you've also discovered.<br />
<br />
Aside from those, next time you have several k of plat pick up that second Vallorium Ring.  You'll be plenty geared up for 65 LDoN's and XP situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd suggest Miragul's as well.  I was all about Tak gear at first but with the amount of time that it takes to get 1492 points, screw that.  Unless you do a LOT of LDoN, I'd say go for the Miragul's armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sturgis</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, the 760 armor sets are much easier to attain, and about two-thirds as good as the 1492. The 1492 chests have 100 hps/100 mana typically, and the 760 chests have 75/75. Stats vary, of course, but the AC difference is even smaller. You might even look at the 442 sets and lower because you could find pieces there that are upgrades that you could get after just a few dungeons.<br />
<br />
If you look at my magelo, you'll see a few Lost Dungeon items. Most were drops (abomination bone ring, amulet of mummy wrappings, earring of architect), but a couple were purchased. The helm I wear is only the 150 point plate set, but it was better in my opinion than the helm I got from the 8th shawl event. Heck, the 150 point boots would be better than the crappy ones I got - I just havent decided to drop the points for them yet.  I got the 15 stamina ring the first day Lost Dungeons went live, and have never seen it drop since. Both my 1h blunt weapons are dungeon items too (in my bag).<br />
<br />
Getting to 65 helps too. When Lost Dungeons came out, my warrior was only 52 and I didnt get many points for wins. Even at 58, I still only get 27 points for a win. So it'll take me almost twice as many wins as it took my 65 main to max out a dungeon and get the best armor. In fact, I still have more dungeons under my belt than my shaman, and he has already maxed Everfrost for his armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abividad</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 12:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I remember right at 60 I was getting 30-32 points per win on a normal dungeon with an average level to make it a 60 dungeon. I've done a couple with my Shaman at 62 and all others 65 on normal and got 40 points for the win. Your max points on a normal at 65 is 51 for a win, so you can have an idea of how long it'll take you to accumulate points</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fumm</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 01:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your boots are probably your slot hurting the most, suprised noone ntoiced or I missed it.  My advice there is grab anything you can get your hands on. Your legs are the next slot idd upgrade, theres some pretty decent ones from the normal Rujark adventures, ill see if i can get this link thing to work. (appears not in database so using Allahkazam)<br />

<br />
As for boots heres some you can always find really cheap in the bazaar.<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics18/dusty_soriz_boots.jpg <br />
<br />
I would also suggest an elemental bow of any sort if you can possibly pull it off.<br />
Anything you have that is 50hp or better you dont have to worry about atm.<br />
<br />
Everything else is pretty much upto you with how you want to peice together your Ldon suit.</div></div><hr />

[B]Your boots are probably your slot hurting the most, suprised noone ntoiced or I missed it.   <br />
<br />
Aye, boots and legs are my first priority.  Im gonna shoot for the 440 point LDON boots and the 790 point  LDON legs<br />
<br />
Last night my lovely Druid friend and I successfully camped the Seer in Drog and I ended up with a Sword of the Bloodsworn.  :)<br />
<br />
Now i just need someting to duel wield with it :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with ignoring the Tak armor.<br />
<br />
How does your group tank?  Do you always MT or the paladin?  Have you considered shareing agro?<br />
<br />
With the paladin stunning a lot, it'll help reduce enemy DPS.  It'll be tough to get agro back off him, but when Taunt works, it works.  You can also /shield him if he gets low and you don't get a successful Taunt.<br />
<br />
If the paladin is MT, I'd want more DPS.  I equaled the DPS of a 63 rogue I grouped with recently, and I surpass 65 monk damage if they don't have much vengeance.  Consider Vengeance augs and the 150* cold DD aug for your WMBS.  Ykesha may also be a consideration if you want agro with your DD.<br />
<br />
*The lesser cold DD augs are not nearly as good because the 150 one has -25 resist modifier.  If you want a lesser DD, go with non-cold.</div></div><hr />

Aye, we tried a High Risk and got OWNED :(  Of course alot of use are still pretty rusty so we plan to keep trying if for no other reason than to improve our tactics.<br />
<br />
I pretty much MT 95% of the time.  Gonna play around with having her MT on occasion. :)</div></div><hr />
