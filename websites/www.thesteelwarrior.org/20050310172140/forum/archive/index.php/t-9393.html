At school, some of my friends have some sweet muscle cars and we always get into the argument of Ricer vs. Muscle.  I myself prefer the sound of the Twin Turbo whining and the blow-off valve cherping.  On this post I'd like you all to name what car ya drive, or one you are working on to race, and what you perefer (American built vs. Japanese).  I'm interested in hearing your responses.<br />

I guess I'm the first<br />

<br />
By the way it sounds by your ost; you were born in the 1980's; and you don't really have the same connection to the muscle cars of the 60's-70's like we have.<br />
<br />
Overall; you're doing the same things to your little cars that the kids back in the 70's did to theirs. I think it's a great thing; hell; if they could make a 1970 Chevelle SS 454 with as much horsepower per cube as the ricers have on the budget these guys have these days...it's really incredible.<br />
<br />
Personally; I like my heavies. Chevelles, GTO's, Roadrunners &amp; Barracudas all hold a special place in my heart as cars I dreamed about and saw as the 'street rides' of the day. But, i'm 35 years old. You see the Civics, 300Z's, Focus', and the likes as the choice of racers.<br />
<br />
Myself; I love Oval Track Racing. Nothing beats a 2610 lb. open wheel modified screaming with 600 horsepower behind 15&quot; wide tires around a track at ~200 mph top speed ( they're faster than Nextel Cup Cars but race on smaller tacks ) .. or the plugging away ever saturday night on my cousins Monte Carlo or his Grand Prix Lte Model class cars equipped with modded V8's churning 400+ horses.....<br />
but myself; I race a 1990 Nissan Sentra in a street enduro class (http://xwarzone.com/shikarii/albums/August_8_Enduro_4_Cylinder/jim_enduro1.sized.jpg); and the cost to do it equal a night of drinking beers whereas my cousin in both divisions has to spend ~1200 dollars to field both cars out on the track on a single night.<br />
<br />
So, in closing; I like the Heavies. But the ricers are what bring the younger crowd into the mix and help keep the sport alive; whther it's oval, formula1, IMSA, dragstrip, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For me, I want a 69 Charger.  I plan on buying one after I buy my house and my brother and I are going to rebuild it from the ground up.  I personally prefer something with a little weight to it.  My brother likes the rice-burners.  I think debating it is kinda pointless, but the rice-burners do have a good advantage in that they are very cheap to trick out.  The old muscle cars demand alot of time and money to get them up to speed.  The main thing I like the most about the old muscle cars is the look.  There are very few car designs today that I like.</div></div><hr />

I like the older muscle cars, I won't lie I'm not a big ricer fan but some of them are pretty sick.  I just don't like the ones that you see 5 different colors with the 20 dollar muffler from wal-mart.  If I can find a decent enough pic of it I'll post it along with my friends Mazda that I actually like.<br />
<br />
The one I race is my Lincoln, she pushes out around 524hp rear wheel last time I had it on the dyno at work.  Her track times are pretty decent too, considering she is a land yacht(something like 4600lbs).  I'll have to find a track ticket to get the exact times.  I've only ever been beaten by a japanese car once at the local track and it was pretty tricked out, he had nitrous which I don't use its to risky imo.<br />
<br />
I used to race the GN but its more of a show piece now.  I'm one of the car guys you see that baby their cars and I'm proud of it.<br />
<br />
The general stereotype that american &gt; japanese in the world of racing just isn't so anymore, well not from my view in life atm.  Go for it if thats what you want, some call me gramps for the Lincoln I could careless  :D <br />

Got a new Turbonetics twin turbo, A-pexi muffler and a flowmaster exhaust (yes they make exhausts for jap cars).  My dad has been helping me put all of it together and im actually not a bad welder  :)   I'm sure if i raised in the 70's id have a muscle car, but ricers are easy to find, twink (i had to say it), and easy to keep running since muscle cars take some money to restor to their former glory.</div></div><hr />

But to the question of the main post, I've always liked muscle cars better (born 1980's!). The look on the muscle cars, the feel of driving one, the raw power sound, it just floats my boat so to speak.<br />
<br />
<br />
I really dislike the big spoilers on newer cars (see pic 1)<br />
<br />
But the smaller ones look pretty nice (see pic 2)<br />
<br />
That's just my opinion, I personally dislike the sound of a ricer, especially the coffe can sized mufflers =\</div></div><hr />

Personally I am working on a really stupid pet project.  1992 Ford, F150, Multiport fuel injected Inline 6 with 50K miles.  In the past I have been all V8's, but after reading about straight 6's being pulled out and used in race cars I looked into it and was surprised how much the engine can manage with easy upgrades.  Check some out.<br />
<br />
Injector upgrades (http://www.bigblocksix.com/Eddie/injectorswap/) <br />
<br />
Head job (http://www.inlinepages.com/~inlinefever/head_modifications.html) <br />
<br />
There are alot of radical parts available that can easily push this over 800 HP with massive torque without distroying the bank account.  All in a run of the mill boring truck, sleeper power!!<br />
<br />
Later I hope to bag it and drop the frame to the dirt.  Also I plan to lose the box and make it a nice lightweight flatbed that I can drive toys right onto.  I also like spinner rims, my wife says I should grow up, but at 35 I am to young to not look G.<br />
<br />
Next up I think is going to be an old Lincoln with sucide doors.  Someone has to be different it might as well be me.  Oh ya, and I am making my kids thier first cars so they are going to love me or hate me, but the cars are gonna be all dad, 1/2 engine and 1/2 gangster, and they have to drive them.<br />
<br />
I also like the WRX and have talked with my wife about buying her one, but she will leave it alone as she is a little more mild then me. Nice car though!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I drive a 1990 Acura Integra GS, only performance mods are Greddy exhaust, AEM cold air intake and a modded chip.  On the outside, it's lowered 2.25 inches (sounds like a lot, but 2nd generation Integras sit like a 4x4 stock), and I also have a set of 16&quot; black rims with polished chrome lip.  It's very understated, but I've put more than a few overstated ricers and automatic V8's to shame.<br />
<br />
The reason I quoted the post above is that I also hate the whiney go-kart sound so many people go after.  The Greddy exhaust is known to be one of the quietest on the market and that is why I bought it.  I think my intake is louder than my exhaust and it makes a nice deep sound in comparison.  Damn, wish I had money to continue modding, stupid college classes /grumble.</div></div><hr />

I remember my uncle Dan's brand new 78 TA, my uncle Tim's Mach 1, and uncle Dennis' Super Bee. There was something special about those cars that you can't find in todays cars, wether they be American or foreign. <br />
3 years ago I ran into a deal of a lifetime. My brother-in-law's uncle was selling a 1970 Hemi Cuda (my dream car), so I purchased it for 15k, it had alot of problems. After 2 years of restoration I finally got it back to what it once was. Plum-Crazy Purple paint job, stock rims with those little lug covering hub caps, everything the way I remembered those cars being in my childhood. <br />
So what it really comes down to, is do you prefer a pissaunt little rice burner? or do you want 426ci of raw American Muscle?</div></div><hr />

<br />
What was even sadder was when Ford stopped using them.<br />
<br />
Now there's no reason to buy a Ford truck anymore.  All the reliability went straight to shit, and they got uglier in the process.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still have my first new car I ever bought when I was a kid in the army...an 89 5.0 lx mustang.Certainly, not as kewl to drive as the old muscle cars,but,a ton of fun on the cheap with easy to get hot rod stuff.Drove it off the lot and probably won't ever sell it.<br />

The turbocharger combined with the 9:1 compression, 440cc fuel injectors(HUGE for that lil 4-banger), Jim Wolf custom programmed ECU, with a 3 1/2 inch mandrel bent downpipe and exhaust. I was running low 13's in the quater, nothing spectalcuar for the investment but the fun factor was through the roof.<br />
<br />
I rarely played with it on the streets, but when I did...there's nothing like the face on an 18yr old kid driving his daddy's mustang being passed by what my friends coined *the granny car*.<br />
<br />
However, when my car was down for a couple of months with a blown transmission(ya, like I didn't see that coming since it was stock), everything got stolen off it. The thieves were stupid and couldnt get the turbocharger itsself but got everything else including my ECU from behind the dash.<br />
<br />
Now I have an all stock 2004 Civic Si. It's nice, but the fun factor is gone.  :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I prefer the sound and torque from a nice V8 powered Muscle car, you have to give a little respect to anyone who can pull 12 second quarter miles out fo a honda Civic.   My only problem with the ricer crowd is that a very large portion of them just don't seem to &quot;get it&quot;.  You can buy a few year old Honda for 10k, dump 20k into it and turn high 12's or low 13's or you can by a mid 80's camaro for 5k, put another 5k into it and easily be in the low 12's.<br />
<br />
I use to work with a guy who's goal was to make his Ford escort ZX2 faster then my friends 400+hp 2000 Camaro SS.  Can it be done?  absolutly.  How did he go about achieving his goal?  first he put on a big mouth body kit.  Cong him adding 800lbs worth of useless crap to his escort.  Next he put a wing that looks like he took it off a sprint car on the trunk.  Yea, more useless weight.  Then he cut a hole in his airbox so the car would breath better.  At least that one might add a horse or two but not enough to be noticable.  Then he spent $1200 on a cam and exhaust change which netted him, on the Dyno, a 12.5 horsepower gain.  I can change my oil or put in a new set of plugs and wires and pick up 12.5 horsepower.  Next he added a 4 inch tachometer to a pillar pod which, last time I heard, he still hadn't connected yet so its just for looks.  It doesn't look cool... he put on a 6 inch exhaust tip which he swore was worth 10hp then He swapped in a new set of rims and tires which were still slightly to narrow for my tastes but they were at least better looking then stock.  when I moved to california he had picked up about 14 horsepower over stock, spent well over $5000 for it and was running the quarter mile in the mid 16's.  The guy with the SS camaro he wanted to beat had just broken into the 11's with a new best time of 11.9.<br />
<br />
My corvette cost me $6,000 when I bought it.  I've got around $2,000 in a new interior, complete rebuild of the front and rear suspension, swap of the TH350 Tranny to a built 700R4 and a set of 3.55 gears for the rear end.  next I'll spend about $3500 on a new Chevy ZZ4 fast Burn Crate motor 385hp/385ft lbs Torque stock then another couple hundred on a new Carb and a set of headers for it and I'll be running mid 12's without any power adders (Turbo, supercharger, N20) for a grand total of about $12,000.  I could get by a whole lot cheaper if I rebuilt my original motor instead of buying a crate motor for it but this way I still have the original motor if I decide to sell it some day and the next owner wants it.  I know two people who have this same setup in 80-81 corvettes and both run 12.5 consistantly, get 24-28MPG on the highway and pass california Smog tests with flying colors.  Not to mention, very few people will tell you a riced out civic looks cooler then a stock 68-82 body style Vette:)  <br />
<br />
As for resale value, go check the prices on any old musclecar then check what riced out civics are selling for.  I saw a Big mouth kit, giant wing, turbo charged Eclipse sell for $7,000 a few weeks ago because the owner couldn't find a buyer at the $17,000 he was originally asking.  The car was for sale for more then 10 months until he finally had to take what was offered.  Putting all that useless garbage on a car does nothing for resale value unless it really is as fast as it looks.  Most however, aren't.<br />
<br />
With all that being said, there is an old Plymouth laser running around here where I live that runs high 12 to Low 13 second quarter miles.  It looks stock runs reliably according to the owner and is just a very badass ride.  The guy also knows cars so thats a plus.<br />
<br />
I give all the respect in the world to ricers that make thier cars fast and know what they are talking about when you ask them what they've done to it.

Seems the guy that has the most points and high finishes drives a .... 4 door Saturn.<br />

F*cking thing rides like it's on rails.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I heard that Pontiac was producing the GTO again, I was pretty excited.  My '96 Impala SS is feeling her years, and I was thinking... hmm... just maybe.  That was until I saw the thing... it looks like nothing more than a somewhat inflated Grand Prix.  Well, I exaggerate slightly, but...<br />
<br />
So the other day, my girlfriend tells me she saw one in our apartment complex.  She she was walking to the gym and heard a car drive by... couldn't see it, but she stopped what she was doing to find it...  it sounded THAT good.  The link below is interesting both because you can hear but, but also because the maker believes (and probably correctly) that by touting the sound, they will sell cars.<br />
<br />
From the driver's seat it sounds like, but you get the idea (http://www.pontiac.com/gto/hearit.html) <br />
<br />
Its not going to make me buy one, and intellectually I feel sorta silly being impressed by simple frequency response, but it must be something pretty primal...  growls and predators and such.  Look at the world trying to reproduce the &quot;sound&quot; of a Harley.  The engines have been trumped for years by German and Japanese motorcycle engines, but that sound is still what people want, despite evidence to the contrary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">10-24-2004, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree on the looks. It seems pretty run of the mill so to speak.<br />
<br />
The engine sounds nice (and is a v8, 5.7 liters I think is said too), but I definitely wouldn't buy it for looks.</div></div><hr />

I have a 97 Miata for SCCA Solo II autocrossing so I'm a bit partial to the picture attached (not me, btw) :D <br />
<br />
I'm a bit partial to Japanese cars since that's all my family has ever owned while I was growing up.  First car was a Subaru that blew a head gasket after a month.  Next was an 87 300ZX NA, then a 90 300ZX NA and 87 Maxima as the daily driver, then the 97 Miata and 00 Integra Type R as daily driver.  I was brought up and learned how to work on fuel injected vehicles so if it's got a carb (ie most older muscle cars), I won't have a clue how to work on them  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alaene</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 08:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm surprised there's no mention of any Italian marques in here, especially some of the sweet performance classics you can get... coming from a UK/NZ perspective these are a lot more available and desirable than American muscle cars.  Guess that's just because there aren't so many about!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tempostra Strifemast</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as autos go, I prefer the sound and look of the old American muscle cars to ricers.  However, I prefer the look and feel of ricer motorcycles to American bikes.<br />
<br />
I myself don't drive either type of car, but I have a few guys that work for me who do; one has a Subaru WRX, another has a Honda Prelude, and the last has an Integra.  I do, however, ride a CBR1000RR and next year will be getting into the racing scene.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SincroFashad</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just traded in my '99 T/A.  Drove it for three years in Hawaii where there's a serious overabundance of rice-burners.  However, just havin the right car doesn't mean you're going to be faster.  Ya gotta know how to drive it, and what the stengths are.  I couldn't count the number of times I completely blew away some hyped up little 17 year old screaming down Kam Highway.<br />
<br />
That's right, my car goes 60 mph in first gear before it red-lines, boyo!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dethvegi1</div><div class="date">10-31-2004, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Myself, I enjoy imports.  Not really the ricer aspect of it, but a truly well built import.  You have looks, speed, drivability fun, after working on DSM's for 4 years, you learn they are fun but you don't want a High HP powered one again. You just run into so many problems with those week after week.  Supra's are underestimated quite a bit. The MKIV's respond very well to mods and can make gobs of power before you start having to change out bottom ends.  The one in the picture listed a page above would actually run 11's with that front mount / turbo setup if im thinking of the right one, given you take that stupid ass system out .   :cool:  If you look around hard enough,  you can find some not so stock viper's against close to the same setup as the supra you saw in Texas vid's.  He also has 3-4 vid's of him lining up against  Hayabusa's on the highway.  I'd say that'd give you a more accurate depicition of how ballsout fast that car is.   It's not really import vs muscle cars for me, more about being a car enthusiast overall.    <br />
<br />
  My dream cars are a R34 Skyline, 94 MKIV TT Supra, and the new C6 Vette.  The vette grew on me pretty damn fast.</div></div><hr />

The grand am looks sportier, and I hate grand ams with a passion.  Sound counts for a lot, and I would love to drive a V8 again, but they could have made it look halfway decent.  The interior looks nice at least.</div></div><hr />

It's nice and simple, one big round gauge and some small nonsense. Bare Bones simplicity at it's finest.</div></div><hr />
