<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After carefully considering the matter for some time, I think the folks at SONY have missed a bet with the incite line. Sure, it basically made warriors a playable class, but other than that, it has some major problems.<br />
As it stands now, you use something like &quot;Bellow&quot; and you get a message that says something like<br />
You bellow something profane at your opponent.<br />
A %T looks angry.<br />
<br />
Not only are these messages boring, but really, if i wanted to really irritate a mob, I wouldn't use profanity. No sirree bob--there are other tactics which are far more effective.<br />
<br />
Here's what I propose. The incite line (now called the &quot;Finger&quot; line) stays the same in terms of hate generation, but the names and messages will change as follows:<br />
<br />
Name: INSPECT (Level 20)<br />
Message: You inspect a %T without asking permission first!<br />
A %T is annoyed with you!<br />
<br />
Name: BEG (level 52)<br />
Message: You beg the %T for some plat for your level 9 spells, even though the %T can see that you are a warrior!<br />
A %T is thoroughly disgusted with you and the way this game has degenerated!<br />
<br />
Name: d3wd (level 56)<br />
Message: You tell the mob in d3wdspeak that his armor sucks for his level, then beg him for his mainhand weapon!<br />
A %T thinks you are perhaps the biggest idiot he's ever met!<br />
<br />
Name: TRAIN (level 63)<br />
Message: You train a %T's group on purpose and then laugh at them!<br />
A %T thinks you and all your guildmates are total assholes!<br />
<br />
Name: Finger of the Ninja (level 65)<br />
Message: You train a %T's group just after they have killed a boss mob, then ninja loot the no-drop items they've been camping forfuckingever, then when the %T tells you he's going to contact a GM, you tell him, &quot;yeah, right, okay, see ya in a couple of months then, ha ha thx 4 playing UR going on ignore now bye bye!&quot;<br />
The viens in a %T's head explode!<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I think there should be some level 65 AAs that would allow players to spend points to get special &quot;fingers&quot; that would anger class-specific mobs. For example, if you were up against an Pally mob, you could use:<br />
Name: Nodisc4joo<br />
Message: You have linked to the mob all the DEV's public statements explaining that they will NEVER EVER give knights defensive!<br />
The Pally %T attempts to ban you from his boards!<br />
<br />
Or, in the case of fighting a warrior mob:<br />
Name: Knightdisc<br />
Message: You explain that Knights should get defensive because warriors have higher higher base MR and mitigation.  Then you offer repeat yourself, speaking more slowly and using one syllable words wherever possible if the %T is having any trouble following your argument!<br />
A warrior %T calls you a troll and a fucktard!<br />
<br />
You get the picture.</div></div><hr />
