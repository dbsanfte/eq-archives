<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have recently apped to new guild that no longer does TIME anymore. I am looking for advise on agro weapons and what armor to look out for. I just got my Kodtaz flag,and will be tagging along soon for the backflagging. They have gone on the way to Txvu. my magelo is under my name, any advise would be thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, if they are done with time and are hitting the top-end GoD content I doubt you'll be MTing too many of the raids they'll be doing right away.  Still, if you can get a Demerix or CBS they seem decent enough indeed.<br />
<br />
Armor-wise, I frankly don't know.  Do they do dkp or merit or what system in general?  If dkp, you frankly have two basic paths.  You can hoard and try to get top items or you can likely pick up almost-rotting things that are bound to be a big improvement along the way.  Personally I'd just look at drops as they come and keep a close eye out for anything with Shielding or a big improvement to the present slot.<br />
<br />
I'm sure you'll get more learned responses though and perhaps you should poke around in Overlord's for more information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't think armor will be a problem once you get to Qvic.  The stuff is pretty common, and not a big upgrade to time gear, so I don't see people who have farmed time for months spending a lot of points/merit on most Qvic molds.  For weapons I'll defer to the uber people, but just about any GoD weapon with an Anger III proc will probably hold you over until the &quot;real&quot; GoD warrior weapon emerges and as someone else said, you probably won't be MTing for a bit, so I wouldn't sweat not having super high-aggro weapons right away.  You could just stick with the SEWS for that matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>lanolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We had 2 warriors apps just recently get guilded. We never went back to PoT for them, I think we did like 3 mobs in PoF to see how that would go, but piggybacking was such a pain in the ass it took forever.<br />
<br />
So we told them to be patient is all. Qvic is great for molds. Eventually they started to get some molds over the ornate they wore. They got some great weapons since our tanks were pretty set on 2h weapons. 1h weapons will still be a ways off for them (we use a auction type of DKP system).<br />
<br />
For you I would not sweat it at all. A SeWs is a tad dated for GoD but its good enough for now. Armor will come fast enough. The guild you are apping for ,I am sure, is well aware of your gear situation.<br />
<br />
What do end game guilds want to see out of a warrior?<br />
<br />
Attendance<br />
Great attitude<br />
Ability to follow directions<br />
Knoweledge of your Class<br />
Skill<br />
<br />
BTW, your gear owns the gear of the apps we had. I dont see your gear holding you back in the least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you'll get loaded up so fast in qvic it'll make your head spin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Attendance  &gt;&gt;nothing less then 100% from me is what they will get, I waited for over a year to get a shot at joining this guild.<br />
Great attitude &gt;&gt; Always i was an officer in my past guild and i heavly focused on that and tried to lead that with an example.<br />
Ability to follow directions...Heh, i read as much as i can before i go into a new zone so i kinda know whats up.<br />
Knoweledge of your Class &gt;&gt;&gt;almost 3 years as a warrior<br />
Skill &gt;&gt; Well that will just speak for itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the replies so far, Kinda sets me atease with myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Jagged onyx staff drops in GoD, if they still diong ikkinz raids. thats good dps/aggro when auged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i was an officer in my past guild <br />
Why leave your old guild? Seems to me if you stick to your guild/friends that you will grow and not have to skip content. I know I dont want to skip anything. I want to see and tank it all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Because i waited over a year for a shot at this guild, I didnt leave my old guild in bad terms at all. I was wished GL bye most of my old guild mates. I dont think anyone ever got anywhere sitting on there hands either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Slamms a good war np.  The guild he is applying to is on a point system, but I am unsure exactly how it works.<br />
<br />
As far as leaving us, many of us wished him well.  Rathe and Corinav left for Time atm, and we're suffering from burnout/summer vacations, I don't agree with his assessment, but we each make our own decisions.<br />
<br />
My pitiful advice would be to talk to their warriors and members and find out whats near-rot, and then figure out your best upgrades.  You do pretty well with a SEWS+A3, and its likely that they dont need you to be MT, SA, or RT, I'd stick with armor for now, and be wise on weapons.  After all, they are the only guild atm where they are at, and they will likely farm quite a bit.</div></div><hr />
