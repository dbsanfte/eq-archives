Got him about half way down. Never got him slowed, only had one shaman at the raid. Cornering him seemd to be the best tactic.<br />
Is having everyone hold attack a bit for every emote/memblur he does the way to do it, for the tank to hold agro?<br />
Can he be slowed? disease slow only?<br />

only thing i remember is his AE, but u can stay out of range of thatand still melee.<br />
<br />
pretty much hes a straight up dps mob, not real complications if your melee are clever.  just stick him in the corner, spend some quality one on one time to get nice aggro and unleash everyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 12:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">He memblurs when it says &quot;Warlord Gintolaken shifts his attention elsewhere.&quot;  It appears to be random so just have people watch for the emote.<br />
<br />
He might be slowable but he's also just about immune to disease and magic, so there's really no point to bother trying.  If I remember correctly Pestilence Shock (DR -200) rarely, if ever, lands on him.</div></div><hr />

Watch your timer for a tentative..its also a good time to blow spirit of rage.  Another tip to help with the ae, make sure you have a bard in group and keep selos up ^_~.  Im 99% sure he is flagged immune to slow, but if not he mitigates 95% so slowing him really isnt a huge issue.</div></div><hr />

He's easily the hardest non-pantheon mob in the elementals with his huge dps and hitpoints.  He's been very, very good to us with arm molds.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
He isnt immune to slow but he is so resistant to magic &amp; disease he might as well  be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wakk</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">is the emote filterable just like pc emotes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">korgo</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">as stated above, don't even bother to slow him.<br />
<br />
CH chain, and have a bard in group to max MR to avoid the proc.<br />
<br />
He does indeed memblur and its a big social emote.  Have all the melee at max range (have them use walk and ease up real nice and slow with mages chaining pets to push him in on the corner.  and a shaman chain curing.  Easy fight.</div></div><hr />

Just have the clerics in one area and everyone one away from them, especially the wizards and anyone who has a habit of drawing aggro.<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1042&amp;source=Live same spell as Skyfury in the Agnarr script.  Have one or two people ready to cure the MT or aggro will tend to ping ping and wipe your raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 02:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Storm Comet is not resistable.<br />
<br />
Selo will block it like it used to block Fennin Ro's AE.  I assume it's an oversight that will never get fixed.  It's not really a huge part of the encounter anyway.  His melee is by far more dangerous than a 3K DD every 30 seconds, unless he happened to be facing the wrong side.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem with a big DD like this is it can hit the tank when he's low hp, and knock him out.  Emperor Sshraezsha is the same way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Per Phantron's tip, use Selos.  I've tanked him twice since first reading Phantron's post and with Selos on, the AE never lands.  You don't take a single bit of damage.<br />
<br />
Now, as far as slowing him goes, don't even bother.  You'll just have to take his brutal ass punishment, hehe.  While his max hit isn't all that high (like 2200s), he hits pretty freaking fast (16 delay) for a 950 to 1100dps spectrum (depending on discipline).  When my guild killed him the first couple of times, we did it totally range.  Now that we have the mem blur / AE rampage worked out, we melee him as well now.  We take him out in ~4 minutes now.  He's got a truckload of hitpoints (1.1 to 1.2 million).</div></div><hr />
