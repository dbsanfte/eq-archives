<br />
Anyone else been to a fun place to eat?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yep, it's a cooking style called &quot;teppanyaki&quot;.  It's not really a traditional Japanese style method of preparing food, but it sure is darn fun to watch and tastes pretty good too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ive been to a Benihana restaraunt out in California.....they did the same stuff....really good food</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>shadowedspawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There is one of these in TN not far from Fort Campbell.  5 of us went one night after coming back from Afganistan.  It was good food, fun to watch, and an all around nice time.  Our bill came out to near $200 including sushi.  The best part was I paid my one freind $40 to eat a whole tablespoon of Wasabi hehe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>shadowedspawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmmmm  $.25 shrimps and a nice selections of cold beer!  The only thing that would make it better would be hotties walking around in skimpy outfits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">damn right, lets merge hooters and TS house, but dont let the chicks cook, i dont want em to get their breasts burnt from flying grease :D<br />

He only did the egg and hat trick for us.  WAsabi is Japanese Horseradish.  VERY hot.  He was fine for about the first 5 minutes and then just sucking for the ret of the night hehe.  It was well worth the $40 to me and the others to see that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Best Restraunt I have been to is J. Alexander's in Kansas City.  Best Prime Rib I've ever had and I have gone 3 or 4 times now and it's always been awesome.  They will cut it as big as you want, and you get a great salad and a great big pile of damn good mashed potatos with the skins in em.  Finish it off with a Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat beer....mmmmm, can't beat it.<br />
<br />
KC is a great place to go out to eat if you like beef.  Steak, BBQ, prime rib.  Good stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">the place is called kansas city? sounds awsome, cause i love ribs :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vamcoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What i used to love when i lived in KC was Bryants BBQ. Didnt hurt that the meat packing plant i worked at sold them all there meat. Man buy the sandwich and you get enough meat to make about 10 of em.</div></div><hr />

My number 3 son works as a valet there sometimes and it was his pick for his last birthday dinner.  At 40 plus bucks a pop for all you can eat it's pricey but it was the best all around meal I've had in a long time.</div></div><hr />

Hehe, no I mean Kansas City (the actual city) has lots of good steak and BBQ places.  One of the benefits of being in the middle of feedlot/meat packing country.</div></div><hr />

MO or KS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">There's a Thai restaurant in Metarie (New Orleans) called Bangkok Cuisine.  One of my buddies is a friend of the GM, and we managed to sneak in right at the end of their lunch rush one day when we were down for Mardi Gras a few years ago.  The GM seated us and he and one of the kitchen staff served us family style, meaning that they kept bringing out big bowls of different dishes and letting us sample basically everything on the menu.  Best Thai meal I've had anywhere.  Oh, and the GM is half Thai and Half Creole, so they actually had stuff like crawfish curry on the menu.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh, it's all the same city, 90% of it is in MO, just the edge of it hangs over the Kansas border.  I think J. Alexanders is in MO, but it's within in mile of the state line.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Ok I lied, it's in Kanas...actually in Overland Park.  And I didn't realize it but it's actually a chain.<br />

We got an appetizer, 2 premium drinks each, we each got a steak ( I got Filet Mignon)  and we shared one side dish.  The bill came to be just under 100 dollars.</div></div><hr />
