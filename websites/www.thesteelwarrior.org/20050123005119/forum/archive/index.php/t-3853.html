<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nayl</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So yesterday we kill the giant Croc in PoE, and he drops this:<br />
Spiked Skull Shoulderpads (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=13767) <br />
<br />
Which proceeds to rot, because the AC sucks, it has one stat, the effect is weak, and the resists, while nice, fail to make it worth picking up. <br />
<br />
I take a look at his loot table afterwards, and discover he can also drop this:<br />
Shroud of the Stonecrafter (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=15822)<br />
<br />
Rot?  If this thing dropped, there would be blood on the floor from the priests crawling over each other to get at it.  Hell, I would bid on it, if I could equip it, it would make a great melee cloak.  Beyond my personal evaluation, just look at the difference in recommended levels on these things.  Its clear what the Devs' opinion of their relative value is.<br />
<br />
Am I just being reflexively paranoid, or am I seeing more deliberate hosing of the pure melees here through itemization?  I am far from familiar with all of the elemental drops so far, but I seem to be seeing a lot of tasty hybrid, priest and pure caster drops, while there are damn few pure melee ones, which, at least in this case, just suck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One example from earth is the Leaf Jointed Cloak.<br />
<br />
Cant link to its stats from work so not 100% of all the classes that can use it but its very nice for melee.</div></div><hr />

That first item has NO BUSINESS even dropping in an elemental plane.<br />
What a Joke.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We got those shoulders last time. I passed on them and they went relatively cheap. The funniest thing is that the priests get more AC on their item than we do on ours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nayl</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Clarification - I am talking about items for pure melee, that list only Warrior/Monk/Rogue as classes that can use, vs. items that are ONLY for priest classes, ONLY for pure casters, and ONLY for hybrids.  <br />
<br />
I am well aware that there are a ton of all/all and plate class items out there.  What interests me here is to see what sort of attention has been paid to pure melees in terms of specific itemization for them.  I'm betting its not very much at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with you, especially in items from the hard LDoN adventures.  I know they aren't that well known yet, but a mask with 12 ac, 8 stamina, 90 hp, and regen 2 should not freakin be all/all... course thats a rant comin from a non elemental person, so not sure it applies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only other melee-only item I know of, is Drape of the Agile.<br />
It's quite decent, but compared to other class oriented items, its not that great.<br />
<br />
In all of PoP, melees are completely ignored. Not only the casters and priest get MORE items for their classes only,<br />
but they basically share 80% of the items with all other classes.<br />
<br />
99.99% of the items in PoP have mana, int and wis on them.<br />
And I'd say around 50% have a focus on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't forget all of those hybrid only items! What's REALLY funny is that there's a HYBRID ONLY mask that drops from General Druav in plane of fire, and a MELEE AND HYBRID mask that also drops from the same mob. WTF is up with that???????????? There are very few items that are warrior/rogue/monk usable only, but there are plenty that exclude these classes as well that are usable by hybrids. Itemization does suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BattleaxTN</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 07:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's always no good items specified to pure melees, just see the LDoN mechants, have u seen any item speicified to War, Rog AND Monk ? (not counting the Anger 3 item, Warriors should have their aggro even without LDoN Expansion, also, it's just Warrior only)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tachyr</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 09:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only war only item i have yet to see in Elemental is this from Erlysai.<br />
<br />
Puresteel Mantle <br />
Type: Slots Armor: Shoulders <br />
AC 25 STR: +20  DEX: +15  STA: +15  HP: +135  SV COLD: +20  SV MAGIC: +20  SV POISON: +10 <br />
Effect Shield of Pain <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's 40ac now.<br />
<br />
 And if your rogues and monks let the Spiked Skull Shoulderpads rot because of lack of AC they're stupid. Maybe from lack of atk effect though.<br />
<br />
 Anyhoo, PoP pure melee itemization is completely retarded. What few items there are that is. I'm sure the logic is that the fewer people that can use an item the sooner it will start to rot. unfortunately they have 2 problems from that. <br />
<br />
1: They hafta make the few items that are for those classes actually good enough that people would WANT to take them over the multi-class alternatives.<br />
<br />
2: To make the other(majority) of items desirable for all the classes they end up tailored more to the non pure melee classes because of the other stats added to them.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I know one drop on the server, and we've killed him tons and its always stupid blade</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krassus</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 12:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I quickly grabbed those shoulders and as a 9700 hp almost 9800 hp tank i needed them and put the +10 ac augment on them. huge upgrade for me from SoE.
