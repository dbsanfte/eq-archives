After saving for a while, and watching prices in the Bazaar, I think I have a few options to choose from IF I want to upgrade now.<br />
<br />
Magelo is pretty accurate, and I'm looking to probably upgrade weapons at this point, since AC is over 1200, and I'm pretty happy with the HPs for now.<br />
<br />
With 30k pp, on Druzzil Ro I can probably buy a Windblade. <br />
OR<br />
I could get a WMBS, Shortblade of Lightning, and Sword of the Bloodsworn<br />
OR <br />
I could get a Widebladed Greatsword, SotB, and CHoS<br />
OR<br />
I could say screw the weapons, and go for a HP upgrade, like the Chain Mask, or Bloodmetal Earring, or a decent Range Item.<br />
<br />
The possiblilties make my head swim!  Any suggestions, folks?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
Valkir Sunderblood</div></div><hr />

<br />
Though you're only 58, i would recommend trying to rally some guildies and camp the CHoS and SotB, theres a massive thread around here somewhere related to the camp, they drop frequently enough.<br />
<br />
Not sure how much WMBS' run on D-Ro, but you might consider a bloodmetal earring if youve got the cash afterwards.  Idol of the thorned is a quick (albiet small) upgrade to your current ranged item.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One GSOT will take care of your agro and DPS and riposte damage all in one.<br />
<br />
Slap a Ykesha aug on it and if it is like 2k like everyone else's server, you just made the smartest purchase ever in no time :)<br />
<br />
p.s. I like to camp droga more though...I love my CHoS. Just need to get the SotB now, hehe...</div></div><hr />

Spend you plats getting a Soulscream belt if you need STA or an RBG to get some decent haste and stats. If you can hold off for a liitle while, save your plats and buy a CoF and a heavy rubicite girdle.<br />
<br />
You should also be able to afford a Greatstaff of Thunder to go with your new haste. On my server they are commonly under 1kpp.<br />
<br />
Then get a group and go camp a Copper Hammer and a Sword of the Bloodsworn. Solid agro, great DPS, good stats. Way better than your current combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valkir</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for the replies!<br />
<br />
Yep, I should make that slight change. Two mentions so far about the GSoT, and yep, I do have one in fact.  Its in the bag in Magelo, and in my hands most of the time in Norrath! :)<br />
<br />
Since the reasoning seems to be 'you're ok with the GSoT for a while' the other mentions were Haste and Stats.  I'll start looking for 30+ haste, and see how far my coin will take me.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<br />
Is that a true statement?  Should I dump my windblade for plat and get the other?  I currently use a Great Sword of the Bloodsworn and a Windblade.  I also use a Sword of the Bloodsworn and a SBoZ or Frosty in the offhand.  Got a GSoT for 500 plat the other day so Im happy (also have a ToD).  Which weapons would you pawn to buy new items?<br />

Sorry, don't mean to hijack the thread, just looking for options and hell the answers might help you out!<br />

So is the WMBS as good as I can get before I get a no drop 2HS?  Or should I dump the cash into something else?  I figure that I can get 60k for that stuff, and buy the WMBS and still have 50k left over.  I know I need 2 Valor rings and 1 more earring.  Hell that will leave 25kish.  I would hate to part with those if they would be of more use than what I buy later on down the road....  Decisions, decisions.....<br />

No no! I don't consider it a hijack at all!  Hijacking the thread would be asking &quot;So! Speaking of Aggro, did anyone else catch all the aggro Emmitt Smith got from the Cowboys' defense?&quot;<br />
<br />
WMBS goes for around 7kpp on DRo. But if the GSoT is comparable to it in terms of DPS, then I'll keep the GSoT as my main weapon, and go back to looking at HP/STA upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WMBS is better DPS than GSoT, but GSoT is better aggro by a long shot (that proc goes off a lot). I keep both on my warrior; they each have their place.<br />
<br />
As to the Soulscream belt, I'd recommend getting a group into Veksar and camping the thing. It's an easy camp, although the belt is definitely the rare drop. We've taken the rotting Shopkeeper down 7 times so far; he dropped the belt the first time, and the Deathguard Shield every other time since.<br />
<br />
For your level, that camp in Veksar is not only likely to drop a good item (and another good priest item from the other named up the stairs), but it's great exp as well. A single group should be able to handle the camp easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gabriel</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is all my junk.  I have the SC belt.  Was a nice camp.  As to the above, I was thinking last night.  I am not the MT in a lot of my groups due to higher lvl warriors.  Anyways, I think I will keep the SBoZ for DPS and non-agro.  Ill dump the WB and the GWoBS and the Frosty and pick up a CHoS.<br />
<br />
Anyways as to my other stuff:  I know I need to upgrade 1 earring, I could use another wrist, but not a necesity atm.  I could use a nice bow, but I cant justify spending 40k on a Bow.  What else catches your eyes?<br />

Things that need to be replaced:<br />
<br />
Vah Shir Claw Earringtter used on your twink, get something with hps, ac, or at least something besides str dex and 4ish ac. Would suggest 35hp earrings, Solstice Earring, Bloodmetal etc etc.<br />
Cobalt Gauntlets --&gt; Buffs nice.. if you dont have a shaman.. and you like getting str tapped after a while.. and a buff you cant take off.. and... yeah actually its not that great :P thats what the boots are for, but you want to scrap those and get SS Gaunts MQ.. 1k max<br />
Velium Fire Wedding Ring --&gt; Valorium Ring of Gallantry<br />
Barbed Dragonscale Boots --&gt; Most warriors look at these for the hps and sta.. but then see the ac and shudder.. and then pass them off and let the rangers take them. Apparently there were no rangers around  :( but you'll want to scrap those for something with more ac, at least 24ish. SS Boots would be 1kish, there are some others comparable for around the same price, just look around ;) <br />
<br />
now a I have a question for you: How is that Greatsword of the Bloodsworn? Acrimony decent aggro? details!!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gabriel</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 08:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greatsword is just OK actually.  I group with certain people most of the time and we know how to let me get and keep agro.  The proc isnt all that, 20 hps and 20 mana over like 4 ticks (dont quote me on the time) but it gets their attention.  Still nowhere close to my GSoT though and honestly I think the new LDoN sword out with the 75 lifetap can get argo faster.<br />
<br />
As for the upgrades, yes those are all good.  Ill look for em.  I honeslty thought I was wearing FH in the glove area lol Opps....</div></div><hr />
