<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I do see it as a general problem.  The &quot;Time Loot&quot; aspect is a red herring.<br />
<br />
If a Time equipped Monk can tank Fennin Ro, how well should a Time equipped Warrior do?  Unless its one time equipped Warrior with minimal healing support then I suspect something is out of wack.<br />
<br />
Simply put someone wearing magic pjs should not take a direct hit from one of the higher monster currently available reguardless of equipped loot, reguardless of CH rotation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah that guy has really good gear. And it does show that with the crazy gear coming from higher up lots classes can tank a tier lower than them. <br />
<br />
However, not that this monk tanking FR proves it,  there is no doubt in my mind that monks are way overexaggerating their tanking deficiency. If there is no other plate tank in my group and the MT dies, a ranger/monk is next to tank in my group. I really do not see their hp drop like casters. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Monks need an improvement, but its  not in the taking hits department IMO. They need 10-20% more innate dps or upgrades to their entire weapon/fist line, and a better FD so that they are the preferred pullers. Or an entire utility overhaul with the rest of the mellee classes.  IMO not one freaking class needs anymore upgrades in the tanking department right now to get closer to warriors, its already too much.<br />
<br />
Reading that post is interesting though to see how many people think warriors are so beefy they take a 5 second ch on FR. The sad fact is my warrior has been on ice for 3 months now because of this. I do not even feel like a tank getting 1second ch cycles, and the heals are coming so fast that really tons of classes can tank almost anything we can without DEF as long as they do not get 1 rounded easily. Its become a diminishing returns class with /crutch defensive.  Always has been I guess but its gotten to silly levels over the past year for me.<br />
<br />
All this actual example shows is that poor  itemisation can really mess the tanking game up. Like Furor said on his board this is not a monk issue, its a general tanking issue.</div></div><hr />

- The warrior fight was a lot longer as it was performed using a very small crew.<br />

That's huge.<br />
That alone reduces DPS to the monk by 300-400.<br />
<br />
<br />
But lets break this down to reduce it to how fucked up your numbers are....<br />
<br />
1 BoV every 20 seconds...That's 16000 damage before it wears off.. As we know from your &quot;Max Hit&quot; Listed there - your monk NEVER got hit without BoV on him. Therefor EVERY BoV lasted 20 seconds WITHOUT breaking. This would make Fennin's DPS 16000/20 = 800dps OR LESS.<br />

This is why your parse is fraudulent.<br />
<br />
<br />
For the record, Vabtoo the monk has 6 Quarm loots. around 7150hp unbuffed, and you can see his AC up top.<br />

My own guild is farming Fennin, I am the guy who tanks it each time. My buffed AC is at about 1900 at the present, and the DPS from Fennin is still close to what he does to Tanamar who has 2225 AC (I don't get many BoV's during this fight).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Only possible way he could have those items fairly - fairly meaning merit averages out the same as dkp, only items go to those who could best use... not merit meaning vabtoo is SO great he deserves the best loot first -  is if other ppl prefered earlier phase loot over late phase and quarm loot.<br />
<br />
Like somone posted on MB, it would take having Time to yourself and farming every quarm that pops for 3 more expansions to gear a guild like that.<br />
<br />
<br />
- edit, edit merit does mean new gear goes to the class who could best use (dependent on their current gear), right? Not that loot goes to the person who deserves it for being great.</div></div><hr />

This will probably end up getting Bulwark of Vie nerfed. I never really liked the idea of the spell mind you as I felt it would do exactly this, infringe on our tanking ability. Unfortunately, I'm a BoV junkie so losing it will suck, but it really shouldn't be a spell castable on every damn class.</div></div><hr />

Maybe there is a way to salvage the situation.  If Vie applies its effect *after* the plate mitigation damage reduction calculation would that make sure that plate classes get a marked effect effect by tanking?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And you are saying that all through your EQ 'career' you chain stun/ aggro locked mobs on you? I find that EXTREMELY hard to believe. YES, the capability to GAIN that AGGRO-LOCK was almost always there. However, There were HUGE mitigating factors against you being able to USE it 100% of the time. It was and according to SOE class definitions still, supposed to  be used in an emergency to save the weaker armored members of the party. <br />
<br />
But so many paladins seem to forget a lot of that. All they can remember is 'KUNARK! KUNARK!' which they insist on crying ever time class balance comes up. Well I hate to tell you, but the ideas in Kunark were a lot more balanced than they are now. What happened is that something needed changed either itemization OR skill tables, changeing either would have worked fine, unfortunately they changed both...  and now we have overpowered paladins doing everything. I wait for the day for SoE to overcompensate for the current melee imbalance, but alas that day will never come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">As Landrain so wonderfully stated, there used to be minuses to having the ability to aggro lock. Since those are gone, so should the bonus. After all, you used to be, what, 60% of a Warrior, and now you're 85-90% of one. By all logic, you should be less of a caster now, since you've moved further toward your melee side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">If the monster was pounding on a Cleric in Lower Guk you bet your plat I would stun the monster to get it to at least stop hurting the Cleric.<br />
<br />
Its the same tactic in today's game.  If a monster is doing something it isn't supposed to do, I stun it and deal with the consequences later because for sure beating on the casters isn't a good thing.  I will admit: it is easier to deal with the consequences of doing that if I am the tank.  Otherwise I take aditional actions to shed agro.  In any event, it is far better to have the monster not hurt the caster as well as it is far better for the monster to beat on me than them even if I'm not designated as a tank.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, is the flaw in Vie the fact it didn't scale well (the same flaw in Karn too)?  Then again every buff behaves that way....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some of you are so fixated on Paladins that you fail to see problems beyond.  This thread shows how screwed up different ends of melee are getting.  Paladins are one of the smaller worries Warriors have.  Clerics with Vie are more than happy to let Beastlords and Rangers tank away.  These classes can tanks just as good as plate and dish more damage and effects than any of them.  Yet it is still some Knight driven conspiracy to keep Warriors LFG.<br />
<br />
Keep on believing that Knights are your only problem.  Keep on dreaming that all you guys need to do is nerf Knights to get back to your happy place.  Keep on thinking that the other classes will want to play the game your way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Aeka, I agree with what you're saying to some degree.  However, the fact remains that in most cases, at least in my experience, the &quot;If I'm not the tank I take additional actions to shed aggro&quot; don't apply.  That being because you are capable of tanking almost as well as a warrior, so in most cases that I've seen, you will be the tank.  In many cases in the groups I've been in, a knight tanks, just because it's better than having me try to compete with his spells.  If it's an SK, I can usually get and keep aggro regardless of whether they're  working with me or not(assuming parity of levels and gear).   If it's a paladin, if he wants aggro he'll have it(stuns and fast group heals), best I can manage is to ping pong the mob constantly, which doesnt help the group at all, and really doesnt even particularly make me feel better about myself personally.  Bottom line, the penalty that knights used to pay for being able to get snap aggro is gone, but all the benefits remain.  This is not as it should be, and needs to be fixed.  If fixing it means bringing warriors up to near knightly levels of aggro control, fine.  If fixing it means nerfing knight aggro down to a pale shadow of what it is now (which incidentally will still be better than a warriors), that's fine too.  And Bulwark of Vie is nothing more than a way for non warrior tanks to have defensive, and further, a way to do it without decreasing their DPS.  I'm not sure what it was intended to be, but I am pretty sure what it is in practice.<br />

edit: You posted your last post while I was composing this one, so this is a response to the previous one, not the most recent one.  In regards to that, you're probably right. Other melees have begun to encroach upon the tank role too, and I'm at a loss for what to do about it.  Based on what we've seen from SOE so far, probably nothing.</div></div><hr />

Berate my shortsightedness if you prefer but no matter how much we might need to be concerned about other classes also encroaching that doesn't change for a second that the characters closest in tanking profile and thus immediately and much more commonly in competition with us are clearly superior choices due to cheap, utterly reliable and penaltyless aggro and other utility. <br />
<br />
Wether the tanking gap between plate tanks and other melee (and indeed casters) needs to be looked at or not, the Plate Tanks must also be balanced within their category.  It's very strange logic to suggest that because there are other problems we should ignore the one directly in our faces.<br />
 <br />
Back when you were fighting in guk, you took noticeably more damage, had notably less hp's and your cleric really felt the cost of the extra heals. That sounds like a fairly major trade off for aggro on demand -  it certainly doesn't exist now does it?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Stuff a component on it then, a nice relatively expensive one if it has as big an impact on tanking mechanics as is suggested, heh :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Axterix EnObelix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">That would suck big time.  Won't impact raids, as what's  a few plat to a big guild if it lets you win the fight easier?  But it would kill it for xp groups.  In xp groups I love it, slap it on all the non-tanks.  Means if the MT loses control for a bit, it's less of a big deal.  Likewise, I slap it on the MT, which makes it a bit less important to slow right away.<br />

If it's a problem on raids, then nerf the raiders, leave it alone otherwise.  Just take 20% or so hp off the elemental/time gear, solve the problem nicely;)</div></div><hr />

The poor thing has dedicated his life to EQ - I mean, most sane people think playing 8 hours/day is too much, and only pull 8-hour stretches 2-3 times a week, right? Vabtoo has elected to forgo any life he might have had outside of the game for this, I think he deserves his 15 minutes of fame.</div></div><hr />
