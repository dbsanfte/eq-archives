Was wondering how agro works on an effect if a mob is immune to the effect. I've heard 1/2 agro, 2/3, full, etc. from plenty of people. Just wondering. Does anyone actually know?<br />
<br />
Thanks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Full. I can tell you this by tanking both emp and seru numberous times, normal aggro goes through even though it's negated.</div></div><hr />

Still produce the same agro. (note we are talking about procs).<br />
It is the same for almost all the spells (i think paladin stuns got tweaked).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mystaviant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not sure if paladin spells got tweaked, but on my main, a shaman, if I cast slow on immune mobs, they do NOT squish me, and don't even look at me, for that matter.  I know a few weeks/months ago, casting slow on immune mobs meant a fast death, now it seems I can chain cast it on them, to no real effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Immune may have &quot;less&quot; agro but its still there.   I (well my enchanter)  tried to mez a named in a high LDON (there immune) and he came running for me like I had a fire in my pants and he was a firefighter.  This was Wed night (2/4) when CT crashed.</div></div><hr />
