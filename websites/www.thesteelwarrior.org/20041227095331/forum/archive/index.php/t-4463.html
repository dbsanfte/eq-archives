<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feysboil</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 05:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My warrior is 54, soon to be 55.  Because I've been leveling up with my wife's druid catching up many levels (We got her into the mid-30s just before my warrior hit 51, so I spent many hours with her in CoM racking up AAs while she leveled up).  I also switch to AA when I play that character without her, so we can stay on pace with each other.  As a result, I've gotten my first 6 AAs done (Run3 and Regen3), and have 5 points (almost 6) banked for Archetype skills.<br />
<br />
My first inclination was to put the first 4 points into ND1 and either CS1 or CA1, and when I get AA #12, put those two points into the one of CS or CA that I don't already have.  But now I'm wondering if it wouldn't be better to get 55, ND1, and then crank out that last little bit of AA #12 and put the four points into ND2.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?  Or is my thinking way off?  I'm thinking that HPs and defensive skills are my main objective, but not sure which order of acquisition will help me the most.</div></div><hr />

I think a lot of people on this board are in the same HP &gt; all school I am. *shrug* CA and CS aren't going to mitigate spell / dot damage after all, you can never have too much HP =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feysboil</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 06:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks.  That's basically what I was thinking, and why I sought clarification.  I'll go with ND2 for these 5 (plus one) points, then stick to leveling to 65, and come back for more AAs after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if most of the time you duo with your wife I'd strongly recomend going for ca (or cs doesnt really matter which from parses). It will help you to save healing mana since it will be a while anyways before your wife gets CH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Casai wins it.  For duoing with a druid, CS might actually be the better choice.  ND won't help you, since you won't be getting healed for full anyway, so that leaves CS and CA.  With CA, you get missed more, which means less hits on your thorns, which means less damage, so CS, which has been proven to be essentially the same damage reduction as CA, will be the way to go for the first few AA's, at least until your wife hits 58.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">glad to hear we agree on something Haass and you are right about ds. Didnt think of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, it actually happens quite a bit...someone and I get into an argument about something, the shit flies, then a couple months later we realize we're really both on the same page after all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feysboil</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, for now I mostly duo with my wife in low-end areas (where the fights aren't too rough for us to handle) or we manage to do small guild groups or LDoN adventures.    Problem is, most of the mains in our guild are 65, and a 54 warrior, while he can still get XP, is like a fifth wheel in the kinds of places most of the 65s go.  Good XP to sponge off of, but I'd rather contribute more.<br />
<br />
The long-term goal would be to get around 60 or so and then start using this guy as a defensive/MT for raids, so my question is really what path to take with that in mind, not what to concentrate on for duoing.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the input though, gives me plenty to think about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd still say that duoing is going to make more of a difference in your priority for AA than wanting to be a defensive tank.  As for using this guy for a MT for raids, does the guild not have any 65 warriors? Do they not have any gear? Do you really think you will pass them? There's only 1 MA on raids, and if it's not you, you're not it.<br />
<br />
If you want to contribute more, level.  Levels do more to help MA than any AA.<br />
<br />
And ND won't help until the druid hits 65 either, you should be over the point at 58 where a druid CH is really a CH (~4k buffed).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">11-23-2003, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm when I got CA3 and CS3 (or any other level of either) I never noticed a BIT of difference.  But with my ND3, my HPs increased.   A few hundred extra hitpoints buys your healer time.<br />
<br />
So I'd go ND3 first.  Besides, when someone is trying to make a decision between which warrior does what, they frequently go by HPs, ignoring CA CS LR ID etc and any other AA that isn't easily quantifiable.  <br />
<br />
So, IMO, level 50, then runx3, then level 60, then either basic AAs or level 65.  Don't go for any fancy AAs until 65. Levels &gt; all.<br />
<br />
Runx3, ND3, and Area Taunt are the AAs I got that seemed to matter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I'm content to progress slowly when duoing, and get XP in fits and spurts when I can soak off guild groups in tougher zones.  I'd rather not sidetrack my AA progression by basing it  on a style of play that is not my long-term intent.<br />
<br />
As for using this guy for a MT for raids, does the guild not have any 65 warriors? Do they not have any gear? Do you really think you will pass them? There's only 1 MA on raids, and if it's not you, you're not it. <br />
<br />
Sadly, our guild does not have any active warriors higher than myself, save one who just came back to the game, and his 60 warrior is not very well geared.  He is completely unable to compete with our 65 SKs or Paladins in the tanking department.  I may or may not pass him, but the possibility is there that he won't always be available, and my warrior would have to step up to fill that role.<br />
<br />
If you want to contribute more, level.  Levels do more to help MA than any AA.<br />
<br />
And I fully intend to level straight to 65 from this point (with the exception of finishing that 12th AA point so I can spend it as soon as I hit 55).  My situation is that I have the AA points already, I just want to find the most effective way of spending them.<br />
<br />
And ND won't help until the druid hits 65 either, you should be over the point at 58 where a druid CH is really a CH (~4k buffed).  <br />
<br />
My main is a 65 druid, so I'm fully aware of what their capabilities are.  Ultimately, more HPs is never a bad thing, whether or not the healing is more or less effective.  I'd rather have a few extra hundred HPs and survive a tough fight than not have them, die, and make the druid's heals &quot;more efficient.&quot;  I'm pushing close to 3.5khp unbuffed as it is at 54, and my gear is actually at the point where I need to start upgrading again (closing on 1100AC).</div></div><hr />
