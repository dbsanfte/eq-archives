There are much fewer adds that spawn per wave, and you easily can get them under control.  He could seemingly be done with 50 people np...this happening to anyone else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KhalimBloodhelm</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, this has been noticed on Tholuxe.  About half as many adds as usual spawn for RZ, and since his adds are probably the hardest part about him, it makes the fight much easier.  Too easy, if you ask me.  the general conensus is that its a bug and not something intended, tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ODB</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bug or no, it has gotten much easier. Expect to see more guilds in the elementals soon. Though i think the encounter has been gimped for about a month or more?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinekus Aleswig</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We killed RZ last night for like the 10th time or so and he is hella gimp due to whatever happened.  Its not isolated to any sever.  I really hope that SoE fixes this because its BS IMO to make the right of passage into the elemental planes so gimp for guilds workig on it right now when those of us who have been in the EP's for a while, had to bust arse to kill him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niafix</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">we killed him on our first try ever, we weren't expecting to win at all. He did seem overly easy, and i was kinda dissapointed. i was looking foward to a very difficult battle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tima</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Happened to us Sunday when we popped him for backflags. On Prexus the Plane of Fire is stupidly lagged. We fought Blaz and he only ae'd like once every 2 minutes and went for long spurts without attacking at all. We assumed the same thing was happening with Rallos, that either we or the server was causing the script to lag. Think we had 8 or so adds when he died...was pretty sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magg</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">RZ is definitely much less difficult than he used to be.  Hardly any adds and he drops very quickly.</div></div><hr />
