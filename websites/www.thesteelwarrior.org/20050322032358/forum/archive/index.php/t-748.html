<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 03:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last monday our MA went down right after emperor woke up and I jumped in to tank.<br />
I was using my 2hs bane weapon as always on this encounter, hit ae taunt and defensive right after.<br />
Although noone else died the mob seemed to look not exclusively at me at first.<br />
After getting a tell from our MA to use my 1hs combo (i got my bloodfrenzy less than an hour before that) i didnt have any problems holding agro.<br />
Now my question.<br />
Although bloodfrenzy/blade of carnage do not a single point of damage against emperor it seems that i was always on top of the hate list.<br />
I didnt log the fight but i am pretty sure that i didnt have that many procs and we all know what kind of damage nukers/pet classes and rogues with bane piercers can dish out against emperor.<br />
Is it possible that the damage is calculated for the hate list even if it is not really done ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You must have had a fair amount of Procs Gnomb, you probably just didnt notice them in all the spam. <br />
<br />
I was using BOC/Blackout and they were proccing a lot, but i didnt take aggro from you once, if you hadnt had any procs of your bloodfrenzy, them im pretty sure i would have gotten smacked around.<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 05:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is my theory :<br />
<br />
Non bane generate almost the same agro as bane weapons.<br />
(I cant see any other reason emp raped me a couple of times with Primal 2H at inc)<br />
<br />
Banes are totally useless on emp. Never bothered to use them.<br />
Just get 2 procing weapons and you'll be fine.<br />
<br />
As for seru, no idea caus of the stun. But for Emp MT , bane = useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 05:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You get aggro from attacking a mob, even when it is invulnerable to your attacks.  So you still get aggro for each swing (not for any damage though).  With two eb, you probably proc'd enough also, even if not a ton.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 05:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe Bloodfrenzy procs a lot more than BoC for sure.<br />
On the way to Tallon Zek on monday night our MA and me had 8 EB procs in a single round all showing up in the spam (i have group spells/effects on usually).<br />
And we were both dualwielding bloodfrenzy/BoC.</div></div><hr />
