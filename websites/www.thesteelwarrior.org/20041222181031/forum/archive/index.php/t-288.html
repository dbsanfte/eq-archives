<br />
I am really interested in getting this for my charm slot (although right about now I would take anything).<br />
<br />
Sorry if this is posted somewhere else, but I have been looking everywhere and can't seem to get any straight information on where and more importantly from what this drops.<br />
<br />
Anyone happen to know?<br />
<br />
Thanks ahead of time.</div></div><hr />

I only know of one person that owns it on Bristlebane.<br />
<br />
As to where it comes from, I would imagine probably found in Hates Fury... but purely speculation.  just know that it is crazy rare.</div></div><hr />

I would very much like to know if anyone has seen it drop since then.<br />
<br />
Most of the names in Hates Fury have 2 or 3 drops. One of the drops off the Armsman was switched with the Cabin Gnome it seems, so I am wondering if the charm accidently stopped dropping.<br />
<br />
I have been trying to get this charm for about a month with no luck.<br />

<br />
I'm up in the middle of the night camping a stupid item for stupid reasons and FINALLY after hours and hours and hours it drops!!! Then I click the no drop item, click yes, and POOF it just disappears!!! I was going nuts,  /petition kill me now plz and delete my account.    Then a person in my guild says to me hey load default UI and see if it is autoequiped.  Sure enough my UI w/ charm slot was not charm compatible and it was there.  <br />
<br />
Well its a pretty nice charm and you wont have to carry around a million pp or group with your own class ect.  <br />
<br />
You might be asking yourself why would someone spend that much time camping that?  Well it was a personal goal (note hp on this ss)<br />
