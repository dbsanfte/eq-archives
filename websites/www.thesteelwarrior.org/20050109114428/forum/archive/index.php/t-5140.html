<br />
HA HA HA.<br />
<br />
What a chump. <br />
<br />
Literally one ench forgot to DC a pet since he was busy being CoH link. <br />
<br />
I forgot to pop my shaman potion before jumping in as SA. <br />
<br />
Three people were too close to agro range during inc and AET failed on first warrior so they died.<br />
<br />
I was hurrying too much and didnt put Bard in My group for extra DS.<br />
<br />
Any of the above things not happening = win.<br />
<br />
DC pet was last one up with the chanter and when AoW lost agro on ench due to him trying to pet kite, it regenned to 25%.<br />
<br />
Still can't believe it. <br />
<br />
Idol pop = 7 days +/- 12 hours right?<br />
<br />

At 8030 hps though, I never even got close to dying. I know cheal chain was pretty fast and tight, but with max defense AA's and stuff, it really isn't like the old days hehe.<br />
<br />
I should have set up more tanks. I wasn't really prepped for his hps. I thought his DPS was higher than idol, hps lower.<br />
<br />
Guess not ha ha.<br />
<br />
My usual third assist was dead before the switch and the tank I selected at random for third had no AET and got a bunch of people killed :(<br />
<br />
If our Guildleader had been on, we would have won with flying colors. He is one of the calmest MA's I have ever seen. The guy basically spoonfeeds you your switch. Never even seen the guy die on a switch lol.<br />

I was on of the few level 60's, wizard, didn't have giants bane.  :\  That alone would have made the difference as the next time we did him I doubled my damage output with giants bane.<br />
<br />
Getting boss mobs to 1% and wiping just blows.  :\  The good thing is you were so close that almost without a doubt you'll succeed next time around.</div></div><hr />

Little bit ago I did aow with 11 people &amp; when your dps consists of 3 warriors &amp; 2 mages &amp; a chanter you really get a feeling for just how many hps aow has :p</div></div><hr />

After they nerfed the T-Rods, didn't they nerf AoW a bit?  If so, how different is he now then he was previous to the rod nerf?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah, I see.  I've never had the pleasure of tanking that big orange giant, however I have parsed him.  I believe when I parsed him, he ended up doing about 750dps against a VT level Warrior w/ 9100hp and over 1600ac, fully Defensive.  <br />
<br />
I have been on the CH rotation though.  :D<br />
<br />
I'd imagine him flurrying more than we does now, which he really doesn't all that often, would put some serious Immafuckyouup in his grin.</div></div><hr />

Think Statue respawn is 5 days +/- variance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me put it this way...We EASILY passed the 9 minute mark for the whole fight.<br />
<br />
Our clerics were definitely getting short on mana near the end, and that was with Defensive tanks.<br />
<br />
Anyone got a decent rule of thumb on the cheal timing?<br />
<br />
Our people were using 3 seconds, since I *believe* they were using druids as a full spot in order and it was our first try.<br />
<br />
Our Tanks:<br />
<br />
8600 hps<br />
8030 hps<br />
Some guy I had to tell to tank mid-fight since tank 3 died ha ha.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if you all think that 5 clerics on 5 second chain with the first two tanks would be ok, as long as it was pure clerics and no druids?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jakle, the AOW has a delay on the order of 1-2 seconds, with a pre-defensive spike damage on the order of 7500 HP, probably 4000-5000 spike w/ defensive. Plan your cheal rotation accordingly. I've only botted a warrior on him once, post T-rod nerf, so I'm not firm on the numbers. <br />
<br />
Pre-Trod nerf was scary, our cheal rotation was 8 clerics deep on about a 2 second delay, our tanks still exploded as soon as Def wore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
5 seconds? not with 8600 hp tank. I had 8700 hp on him the other day, 6 clerics 2 sec rotation ( started with 7 but one died on incoming somehow), I only went below 50% once so I can see going 3 seconds but I don't want to take any chances. I tanked the entire fight even after defensive wore off and I think all clerics ended with 60m or better.</div></div><hr />
