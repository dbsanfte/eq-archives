<br />
Well... groovy... but all I'm seeing next to Planar guilds these days is:<br />
<br />
Recruitment<br />
<br />
Guild #1: Warriors (No Need)<br />
Guild #2: Warriors (Closed)<br />
Guild #3: Warriors (Low need - min req: 850AAs and a penis you can hammer nails into concrete with)<br />
<br />
and so on...<br />
<br />
What am I missing here? Did so many warriors stick around through our post Vellious Gimpification?<br />
<br />
Or does more than 3 warriors end up being like a mass of Shamans in a planar raid environment.<br />
<br />
(Or is it just particular to my server)</div></div><hr />

So unlike clerics, who can stack with each other fabulously, guilds don't need much more then 7 or 8 warriors.  Might as well get another DPS class, or another cleric, rather then waste a spot on a warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As other have said, Warriors are a none stackable class...when you have too many, that's it...our guild have 12 atm...but only 8 or so play regularly...and after the 12th was accepted, the recruitment was shut...<br />
<br />
The other problem is equiping a lot of warriors...most EP guilds will want to equip their warriors near the front with EP plate so they can tank better...so the less overall to equip the better...esp with the 4 other plate classes needing loot too...(the numerous Clerics included) heh..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our top 4 warriors are like 350/420/450/589 AAs.<br />
<br />
I don't know if ours is the norm but certainly the desire for a low end Warrior with less HPs than a guild's top Knights can't be very high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilhelmm_Lanys</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me explain the situation as best I can. As mentioned already, warriors don't stack that well. They're DPS sure, ubt not compared to other classes, and you only need so many TANKS in a guild. Notice the word tanks is capitalised, there is a reason for that. As you know, warriors are just about the most gear-dependant class in EQ. Furthermore, in the raiding sense, warriors absolutely need large quantities of good geasr to be tanks. <br />
<br />
Therein lies the problem. It's not that guilds don't want warriors. But, most have enough of their own, warriors which they need to gear up to make them better tanks. They don't want to add another person to that list which they will have to gear up in order to make another good tank. This is why you see the staggering requirements for warriors many guilds these days have. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, what most guilds don't say on their recruiting page is that they are amost ALWAYS looking for tanks. By tanks, as I've mentioned before, I mean very well-equipped warriors who can step into a guild and be MA, SA, etc at least as well as their top few warriors if not better, without requiring a plethora of additional gear to do so. In other words, let's say, hypothetically, that I, with my current magelo profile, apply to an elemental guild, a guild thats maybe taken Fro, hasn't been in the planes all that long, and is still feeling out the EP's. NOw, let's further assume that they have a large amount of warriors as is and are not recruiting warriors. Do you think they will take me? <br />
<br />
WHile this is of course a case-by-case basis, I will bet hte answer most likely will be yes because I have as much HP/AC/solid agro-generation as everyone of their warriors if not more. I can instantly step in and tank for them as effectively if not moreso than their current members. Now, this kind of analysis of course holds true for practically all classes, especially melees, but I would bet it holds moreso for warriors and maybe knights than anyone else, simply because they are so unstackable. IT's an unfortunate circumstance because getting the gear is very tough, but thats the way thing go unfortunately.</div></div><hr />

This has cost me a TON of loot and a spot as MT. I have proof of and knowledge of quite a few accounts like this where the Officers of a guild know, but look the other way.

Its not just that they have stuck around, they sold their accounts and those have stuck around.

<br />
While I sympathize with being fustrated is that the right solution? Granted buying a toon never stuck me as the right way to do it. But I've know good people who bought toons and play them well. You have to consider the person behind the keyboard. And as a raid officer you have the burden of being above the normal expectations of a guild member. People look up to officers. <br />
<br />
I'm not going to touch on the legallity of selling a toon. It's pretty cut and dry. However whats done is usually done. And the friends I have are more enriching than another c00l dude.</div></div><hr />

Everybody has it tough all over now that the limit on raids has been fixed in PoP at 72. NO class is getting recruited right now; most Time/EP enabled guilds have enough right now to do the work. <br />
<br />
 If you REALLY want a shot at an 'uberguild', work your AA so that when you DO app to them, it shows you have an idea of what you're doing. You should also be looking to get flagged - the less backflagging they have to do with you, the more they like you.<br />
<br />
 I'll note that if I was in your guild, however, I wouldn't be participating in any raid YOU were running. It's obvious you're looking for an excuse to jump ship to a higher tier guild, and I'd be damned if I sweated out gearing your ass up just for you to take off.  <br />
<br />
Ouch Partha :) I felt that... <br />
<br />
Well, I could turn around and bite ya... but seeing as you don't know me or where I am at right now, I'll just nod and say &quot;Okay&quot;.<br />
<br />
I've spend the last 5 months running a guild of mid 50's who don't seem serious about levelling, and I'm bored out of my mind... I'm looking to move on and up but not without making sure my guild mates found a more appropriate place to call home. (Which I have aranged over the last month or so) which leaves me and my g-f's cleric in a state of flux (Check out the guild site if you want to see whats what - I don't care either way)<br />
<br />
Gear wise, I dont really care, I'd like to have the equipment necessary to do my job, but unfortunately, without a raid style environment thats going to have to come from LDoN or my bank account (Which is already conning green)<br />
<br />
I'm looking to move on... and I don't think its inappropriate to check out the other guilds on my server and see where they're at.<br />
<br />
I have an opportunity to join an EP enabled guild, but thats not exactly what I'm looking for, I'd like to stop and smell the roses. I guess thats not an option.<br />
<br />
Thanks to all those who took the time to explain why it is we're in a holding pattern, guild recruitment wise... and Doom? evil... I like it... but evil ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-08-2004, 02:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">High end warrior stacks well enough IMO.  As long as you're not running with 8 warriors on a raid there's usually something to be done for everyone.  For example while Knights can offtank most things a Warrior is still generally better (especially on stuff where aggro isn't an issue, and they are not for most offtank mobs).  <br />
<br />
Sure we probably do less damage than a lot of classes but if DPS is all that matters you'd see 20 rogues/wizards and whatnot.  Although we aren't as versatile as a Knight we have very high survivability and an extra tank never hurts.  But it's rare you'll get a high end geared warrior to apply, and low end warriors are simply not useful to a high end guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doomflayer</div><div class="date">02-08-2004, 06:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Often we have eight warriors at raids. Thats what people play, warriors show to raids, so eight are there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is true Daddio. It still sucks tho.<br />
<br />
I have a semi official Eleguild Invite (And yes... basically a piggy back to get the cleric wench in), and while gear is nice, I was hoping to find us a guild that is on the road to Elemental. (Even if that does mean farming annoying mobs for the VT key)<br />
<br />
thanks again for the feedback</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">02-08-2004, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The sad truth for the longest time has been that raiding guilds only need a handful of tanks let alone Warriors.  The rest are &quot;walking dead&quot; waiting for the next one in line to die.<br />
<br />
Until the fundementals of tanking change, there is no real huge need for a bunch of Warriors.  Until tanking stacks you'll continually see this.</div></div><hr />

Our top 4 warriors are like 350/420/450/589 AAs.<br />
<br />
I don't know if ours is the norm but certainly the desire for a low end Warrior with less HPs than a guild's top Knights can't be very high.  <br />
<br />
Difference between a warrior with 0 AA and one with 100 AA is huge.<br />
Difference between a warrior with 100 AA and one with 200 AA is significant but not huge.<br />
Difference between a warrior with 200 AA and one with 500 AA is pretty much zilch.  <br />
<br />
Only reason to pick someone with 500 AAs is because they apparently play a ton, but I don't personally know too many people with that many AAs that didn't get them from joining a kite group, duoing with an AE kiting bard, or doing some kind of powerleveling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-08-2004, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">People who say the difference between 200 and 500 is small are invariably the people with only 200 AAs.<br />
<br />
Even for just the 75 AA on resists that's a difference of 30 svall, which is roughly the amount of saves you get on 2 high end Time loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doomflayer</div><div class="date">02-08-2004, 11:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And your point is after the save nerf? I think 30svall hardly matters anymore, so insignificant is accurate.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daramin</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 01:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm the officer in charge of recruiting for my guild, which is in the elementals and doing ok so far. I'm also a warrior (duh), and am often (I'd go so far as to say 'usually') the MT for our raids. We have 7 warriors total in the guild and I plan to add one more once the right person shows up. More than that I won't recruit, simply because having 7 or 8 warriors means you will have 5 online at most of our raids, and that's enough. Adding more means more bored people, and in my experience bored people aren't having fun, make things less fun for the rest of the guild, and often end up doing stupid shit as a result of their extreme boredom. I play this game for fun, and I'm not going to recruit people that I know will be bored out of their skull and quite honestly are only showing up to earn DKP and get loot.<br />
<br />
Similarly, we have 6 shamans and are not recruiting any more until one of them leaves the guild or the game.<br />
<br />
We have 12 active clerics, and I figure we'll take 2 more then I'll stop recruiting those too, again because people tend to get bored doing nothing but CH rotations all the time.<br />
<br />
The honest truth is that a guild in the elementals is in the top 30% of their server, if not more. There's another 30% of the server or so that would like to be in the elementals, and some portion of those are willing to leave their current guild to get there. The result is that guilds can pick and choose who they recruit, and if you're in a position like mine you find that your &quot;job&quot; for the guild is to turn people away more than it is to help them get into the guild. <br />
<br />
There are some guilds don't mind that they hit 72 people all the time, and often you can -- with enough flags and AA -- get into them with no problem. At that point you find you're the 15th warrior on the roster and you literally have nothing to do. They not only wouldn't notice if you weren't there, other people in the guild are actively annoyed because you *are* there. They'd rather you didn't show up, actually.<br />
<br />
That's the environment you're operating in when you want to apply to any elemental guild. I often get the &quot;my girlfriend is a cleric and will come with me if you let me apply&quot; line. Personally, I could care less, if I have recruitment closed for a class, it's for a good reason. I have this ranger bugging me to let him apply, and saying things like &quot;oh and I see you need SK's, I have an SK friend that will come with me, and a wizard friend, and a cleric, and...&quot;.  We have 10 rangers, and if Brad himself were to apply to our guild with his ranger I'd probably have to tell him no.<br />
<br />
My personal opinion is that anyone trying to break into that stage of the game is far better off finding a guild that is doing ssra and tier 1 stuff, thinking about getting into VT, and grow from there. You're a lot less likely to be just another number on the roster and way more likely to have fun along the way. Of course you won't get uber overnight that way, and if that's your goal then I wish you the best of luck in your search, but I can confidently tell you that guilds like mine are not interested in you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 03:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Brutul except I think the cutoff is more like 250 or so AAs.  There's definitely some useful AAs between 200 and 300 that are worth getting besides resists.  After 300 resists is about it and I consider the impact of the resist AAs to be fairly minor.  If I'm tanking and need resists I have a bard with me and my resists are capped.  If not then my resists don't matter much.  <br />
<br />
I ran out of AAs that I consider useful at about 240 or so and am just sitting on 30 banked AAs til GoD comes out spending a point here and there whenever I actually hit 30 to keep from wasting the XP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, I'm currently looking at the Ssra/Tier1 Flag guild types, not elemental, and the lower guilds are those I'm ranting about :p</div></div><hr />
