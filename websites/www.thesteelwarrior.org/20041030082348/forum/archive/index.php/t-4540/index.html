<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just got a SotB today. My previous setup was CHoS main hand, Wind-worn handblade offhand.  I'm curious about which weapon (hammer or bloodsworn sword) I should wield in which hand.  Planar strike stuns more of the mobs I'm fighting, but force shok is more DD, and just based on my limited experience the hammer seems to proc more often.  Does anyone have any advice about which weapon to put in primary and which secondary?  Thanks.<br />

Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Stun Agro &gt; DD Agro by far.  Keep the stunner in your primairy hand, and then your SoTB in your off hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From my Exp<br />
<br />
if the mob is above 60 and will resist alot go Sotb main hand for better agro.<br />
If the mob is below 60 ChoS main hand will give you more agro.<br />
<br />
SoTB has a 179 DD and a stun effect so double the agro if both land <br />
CHoS tends to proc more but get resisted easier and only has the stun agro <br />
<br />
I personally only switch em out from SoTB main if i am haveing problems with agro in my group.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Another question about the same setup.  Can I anger III aug both of them, or does the fact that the augs are lore mean I have to put anger II on one and anger III on the other.  (not that it matters since I can never find a LDoN group that wants to go anywhere other than MM)  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Great. Some of the random drop augs from the dungeons are so I assumed they all were.  Now if I can just drag some folks away from MM long enough to adventure in Miraguls..... :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats not right. CHoS has the 179DD+Stun/55 and SoTB has 75DD+Stun/65. Personally, I prefer CHoS on mainhand for the ratio and cause I feel it procs more agro than SoTB, even when the stun part is resisted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Otheuym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well to add a question to this. Doesn't a Resisted Proc add just as much agro as Proc that worked? I mean look at caster and they get resisted once or twice the mob is all over them. So wouldn't it be the same for Procs. Whether they resist it or not the agro is the same. And I know the CHoS Stun does not work over a certain level but can anyone confirm or deny through test whether the agro of the weapon is less on mobs that the stun does not work on?</div></div><hr />
