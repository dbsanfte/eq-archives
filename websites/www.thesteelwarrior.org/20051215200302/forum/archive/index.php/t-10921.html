<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tribute</div><div class="date">03-13-2005, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just logged off completely frustrated and fed up with my warrior.  In the crater, I was fighting Bloodpetals that were equal or lvl+1.  After every fight with an equal I had to sit on my butt and eat because I was left with about 25% health.  The last lvl50 I fought, I drank a big heal pot and still got my arse handed to me.  Last week I got my Thrash Blade and respec'd into 31Fury/8Arms, supposedly to take advantage of these up-and-coming &quot;awesome&quot; changes to the class.  What a load of crap!  I know these class changes haven't gone live yet, but I don't see them helping the DW warriors what so ever.  The bug where HS won't trigger weapon effects sucks BIGTIME.  Also, loosing your offhand dmg while waiting on HS is complete BS.  Even when things click and i'm gaining rage like crazy, there is no way in heck to make it into dmg.  I've tried many ways; not clicking HS til my wep is about to swing, ignoring HS completely and staying in BER stance and spaming Whirlwind, not using skills except Hamstring to trigger Frenzy and Executing a full bar of rage at the end.  Nothing seems to make up for the BROKEN triggering of offhand dmg and weapon effects.  Now, they are going to nerf the Thrash Blade so its proc is near pointless.  GRRRR!!  <br />
<br />
I was in Uldaman a few days ago, I stayed in Battle Stance and pulled out all the stops to bring the Boss down, we failed.  We cleared back to him.  I pulled out my TsChamp stayed in DEF stance and the fight went much smoother and we won.  Unfortunately, BOTH the priests rolled on his 50ac 8sta 8agi ring which was a huge upgrade to myself and the other melee in the group.  The 41 Priest won it.  I was fuming.  Hit my Hearthstone and logged.  I have better gear than 80% of the warriors my level and I can't solo for crap  (no, my profile isn't uptodate b/c WoWReader is fugged atm).  What in the absolute hell is up with warriors at 50+??  What is Blizz going to do in the near future to correct these glaring issues??  Probably JACK!  So, WTH do I do but just shelf the warrior or spend another 10G to respec and go back to Arms/Def.  GRRR</div></div><hr />

Classes stop owning you as much, and you start putting up quite a fight.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tribute</div><div class="date">03-14-2005, 12:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wanted to try out DW with my new Thrash Blade so I respec'd from MS to Bloodcraze to take full advantage.  HS seemed to be the only way dump rage.  Tonight, I bit the bullet and spent the gold to respec back to my previous 32/5/14 build.  I was dropping 4 Turtles in Hinterlands before I had to rest.  So.. I tried DW.. It cost me... It sucked.  Now that the week of DW hell is behind, I think I can get back to having fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's really a problem how they made the whole MS thing out to be, totally gimping both opposing tree's. If you want dps you go MS, heck if you want anything you go MS and either 20fury or 5 and 15 prot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">03-14-2005, 12:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ya dual wield kinda sucks for us in most cases, I haven't been a fan of it since like lvl 30.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">03-14-2005, 01:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so thrash blade is getting nerfed. Thrash blade however dare I say -needs- to get nerfed.  Even with the proc in it's nerfed form, it's still going to own. <br />
<br />
I think fury builds really have a ton of potential to do great sustained damage.  Unfortunately, with dual wield having it's stupid hit rate, all you're going to be doing fighting anything equal level+ is fanning it a whole lot.  Try a couple different types of 2h and watch what happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WackenOpenAir</div><div class="date">03-14-2005, 06:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am only level 40 yet, so things might change, but for me it all depends on the weapon.<br />
<br />
I bought 2 1h swords @ 20.5 dps 1,50 second speed and started dual wielding. This worked perfectly compared to the 2h axe i had back then (dont remember stats)<br />
<br />
I aquired the WW axe, and it was obviously better than the DW. (i stayed with DW though because of the cool macro swiching to 2h overpower)<br />
<br />
Now with 2 swords close to 30 dps, DW does very well by itself already. And the overpower macro is just insane...<br />
<br />
The miss rate on DW is not so bad, sure sometimes i miss 6 hits in a row, but that is about just as bad as missing once with a slow 2 hander.<br />
<br />
My rage i spend on the following things:<br />
-Battle shout<br />
-sunder<br />
-hamstring<br />
-Intimidating shout (to save my ass against multiple mobs)<br />
-execute<br />
-overpower<br />
-revenge (when tanking)<br />
-Ocasional rend, usually against strong opponents after 5 overpowers are applied and the opponent is expected to live another 10+ seconds.<br />
-Ocasional demo shout, same as rend.<br />
<br />
On PvP however, i always just use the 2handed axe because it is hard or impossible to keep hitting with the dual wield weapons espescially against non mellee classes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">03-14-2005, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've recently been trying out 1h + unarmed to see how well the lack of miss rate effects my dps/rage build compared to DW. I've been very impressed by the increase. To the point I've stopped equipping my Second Flurry Axe. On a different note......... wth 31 Fury??? That leaves you needing to use HS as a rage dump which is just crap. Maybe with the HS revamp thats planned it could be worth it.If you wnet for flurry my opinion is there is no way Flurry can be worth losing MS's dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">03-14-2005, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">wtf are they doing to the Thrashblade?<br />
<br />
Changing the proc from a triple hit to a double it hit like it's supposed to be.  Supposedly ironfoe is also getting toned down a hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">03-14-2005, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh.  That will make it a lil less potent but not by very much.  Glad they aren't toning down the max dmg on it.  With Impale maxed, MS would crit about 100-150dmg less with the Thrash blade than the big ass hammer from the princess.<br />
<br />
I do hope they fix the off hand not swinging while HS is lit up issue.  HS gets a bad rap but that would help matters greatly me thinks.  Uping the dmg of it will help some too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">03-14-2005, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well then I guess you're blaming the fact that your warrior sucks on the fact that YOU chose a broken talent build (Cuz lets face it, there's not a goddamned thing in that fury tree that's worth dumping 31 points into) before it was fixed.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'd probably suck too if I tried to gimp myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">03-14-2005, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd summise that you're basing the opinion that 'warriors rock' with the notion that every single one is / has / wants to be a MS build monkey. Sorry to burst the bubble but I know I detest being nothing more then a 1hit wonder (more like 5 hit wonder tho with how well arms is layed out).<br />
<br />
If you want an example of how a melee tree should work look at the rogue. Many valid build variations that can feed into different aspects of their class and abilities. When is the last time you saw rogues bitching that anything but 30/8/13 sucked, 20/31/0, or.. you get the idea. Probably a reason they're so popular, great build possibilities.<br />
<br />
I'd respec to a fury major but I have enough fun trying to overcome prot's major flaws already. One can only take so much :x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">03-14-2005, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ya dual wield kinda sucks for us in most cases, I haven't been a fan of it since like lvl 30. The only half-decent DW build I saw in action revolved around the procurement of a deathstriker. Even then you're relying on lucky streaks, the whole downtrodden nature of fury - luck. For a class that needs control to flourish that's about the worst possible outcome.</div></div><hr />
