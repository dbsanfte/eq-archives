<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tirien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Playing my chanter in BoT last night I started thinking.  When looking from the other side, a good warrior is almost already balanced.  The shield ability is what does it.  Was in a group that the warrior used it in, and had full offensive aa.  Sure I got aggro now and then, but not often, and the war shielded me every time and I never died even though we were pulling 2 at a time.  Next group, war had no offensive aa and did not shield.  He lost aggro if I sneezed on the mob at 80% after doing nothing and I suffered 3 deaths.  Both had same weapons (EXACTLY the same, odd huh?).  Sure in comparison, SK's and Pallies have better hold/snap aggro.  But with the first war it didn't matter if I got aggro, she took the hits for me, and the maxed offensive aa's made a huge difference.   I say take the reuse time out of shield and it is done.  This really wouldn't be unbalanced imo, as the war is taking much more damage using it, and if they use it too much, well they are going down and then we all go down. But the point I am trying to make is, wars are the premier tank, people just don't realize it because 98% of them don't have/use the skills they need to be using.  Its a trade off, The pally/sk doesn't lose aggro, but with the good wars, it doesn't  matter if they do.  I play a 60 war and know what its like, so don't flame me too much please, just playing the devils advocate and proposing a different viewpoint.  Playing a caster and a war I see both sides, and trust me the war that uses shield/defensive/has the right aa gets the invite back in my groups, the ones that don't get put on the do not group list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Uira Tawhaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">has the right aa gets the invite back SIC the ones that don't get put on the do not group list.<br />
<br />
How does the warrior get said AA's? Solo undead? Fear kite? Oh.. that's knights.. Sorry. ;)<br />
<br />
I'm just teasing and you're certainly right about /shield helping but I don't think this answers the issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eradani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well, first off, /shield doesnt generate any aggro.  go test it yourself someplace where you arnt KoS, and someone else is fighting.  or when someone is fighting a rooted mob, shield them, have them back away, and sitdown next to the mob that is currently attacking no one.<br />
<br />
secondly, I'm glad a warrior with every offesive AA can maintain aggro a fair amount better then one w/o.  but I'm a little disturbed that those warriors that dont have those AAs wont be allowed to work on getting them in your groups.   (or because it seems to be popular opinion, anyone elses groups.)<br />
<br />
so, here we are.  most warriors are pressured into getting all their defensive AAs first, then they arnt wanted for groups because their offensive AAs fell behind?<br />
<br />
I sure am glad you can see both sides, I dont know what I would have ever done w/o your thoughtful advise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tirien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hehe, just said playing the devil's advocate :) <br />
<br />
True enough, you have a point.   How do they get those aa's if they don't get groups?  But perhaps I said it wrong.  Its mostly the shield ability use that sways my mind these days.  When the war pulls 2-3 mobs that hit me for 800 a pop, if I get a resisted mez, I NEED that /shield.  More often than not, they let me die and then I see &quot;going defensive, watch your aggro&quot;.  The offensive aa's are not the needed part, they just close the gap a little more.  And true, /shield generates no aggro of its own, but unlike defensive it does not decrease the wars ability to generate aggro at all.  Like I said though I say take out the refresh timer (but keep it limited to one target at a time).  Its just a different way of looking at it, with /shield I can take aggro and live.  I like many others was caught up on the ability of the tank to keep aggro previously, now I am thinking a little differently.  With the war with no offensive aa, yeah I got aggro much too easily, but more often than not I died with 1-2% of my cast bar left on that mez/slow that would have made all the difference, and /shield would have kept me alive to complete that cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Uira Tawhaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">(BTW Tirien until I started playing a warrior I felt *exactly* the same.. I'd group with a warrior I knew that would shield but since 80% of them didn't I wouldn't even bother asking and instead would think to myself &quot;If only they'd /shield. The ones who don't are giving the class a bad rep.&quot; I guess I still think that from time to time about us.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eradani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just have a hotkey that does /shield &lt;slowers name&gt;  works fine.<br />
<br />
I personaly havent gone the total def. route myself, because I could see where it was heading.<br />
<br />
I just found your post to be a little funny, you seeing both sides of the issue, and yet basicly saying you'd take a knight over a warrior every time, unless you knew for sure that said warrior had 150-200 AA prior to ever grouping with you.  and that he used the shield ability as often as he could.<br />
<br />
I'm sure you can see the point I'm trying to make.<br />
the problem isnt so much your opinion, it's that it's shared by so many.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cipps</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We wouldn't have to shield if we could get snap agro.  I rather have more agro then a timer in /shield lowered.  Not losing agro &gt; shield</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So first I need all my defensive aa's to tank better than a knight, then I need all my offensive aa's to hold a respectable amount of aggro compared to a knight with no aa's? No thanks.<br />
<br />
And /shield has such pitiful range as to make it useless.  Besides, the real problem isn't getting aggro back, it's the ping ponging all over the damn place and the fact nukers have to resort to rain spells with war's to avoid those ping pongs which of course all equals to much less dmg from everyone with a war MA'ing as opposed to a knight.<br />
<br />
/def is the our ONLY use.<br />
<br />
I really don't see how anyone can argue with the million other posts all stating these problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tirien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Its a mindset that needs to be changed on so many levels, through many different classes.  In terms of the range on the ability.  When I am the slower, I am attached at the hip with my war.  I stand right next to them as I cast so that they can protect me if needed.  How many others do that?  IMO if any other person gets aggro from outside the /shield range, they most likely a class that should be doing everything they can to NOT get aggro (wizard, magician, druid).  And no, I would never pick a knight over a war who uses this ability.  I do NOT want snap aggro, I want protection.  Pally stunning, well most are not fast enough to react that I do not tank for a round or 2.  And a BoT mob can kill me in that time.  One resisted stun or spell from a pally/sk means that I tank an extra round or 2 and most likely will die.  They have no ability to keep me alive while they are trying to get aggro back, the war does. 2 resisted slows, cleric a second or two late on the heal, that sk aint gonna save me, but that war will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Uira Tawhaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">When I am the slower, I am attached at the hip with my war. I stand right next to them as I cast so that they can protect me if needed. How many others do that?<br />
<br />
Fewer than you'd think... I'll quote myself from the 'a good warrior' thread..<br />
<br />
You may have to explain /shield to your slower because one thing I've noticed a lot of slowers fail to do is stand still! Too many of them run around like chickens with their heads cut off while the mob backstabs them and you get &quot;You cannot see your target&quot; &quot;Your target is out of range&quot; messages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Being willing to work with the limitations of the Warrior class doesn't make the class balanced.  A skilled Warrior combined with a skilled slower will of course minimize the Warrior's issues.  It doesn't remove them altogether though.  And a marginally skilled Knight combined with a marginally skilled slower will be just as effective if not more so.  This is the core of the imbalance that needs to be corrected.  People shouldn't have to work harder to group a Warrior with no particular detectable benefit.   Sure, you can say the Warrior tanks better, but how often does it matter?  With snap aggro from the Knight, unless you're just in over your head, you're much safer than having a Warrior with better tanking but who loses aggro from time to time to the slower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tirien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sad but true for the mindset and skills of so many players in eq.  But no worries a war that works with me will always have top slot in my group :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It reminds me of exactly what they gave necros: twich. &quot;Here you go warrior, you can't do jack with your hps cause your aggro sux0rs, so now you can give your hps to other people at an expeinsive rate!&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm sure everyone else has experinced this kind of thing: I'll shield someone, then they run around, or someone else gets aggro ( like the cleric who was trying to save them ) and you are just as good off as if you hadn't pressed your hotkey in the first place.<br />
<br />
And  Tirien, you group with some crappy paladins if they won't heal you when you get aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tirien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">As an enchanter, I get aggro from a resisted slow.  That pally heal is not going to save me, the stun will *if* it works and does not get resisted.  Can only cast one spell at a time.....  Either way that pally is gambling with my life.  Don't worry, not saying war's aren't broken, or at least need some help.  Just presenting a viewpoint myself and many others I know have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Eradani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The stun cast, resisted or not, can stop you from dieing.<br />
All /shield can do is slow your death down.<br />
in either case, you'll either get a heal, or you wont.<br />
Most people will take the knights knowing that odds are they wont loose aggro.  Which makes my /shield ability a little pointless in their eyes.<br />
<br />
even with /shield running, how many times does taunt need to fail in that situation before you're toast anyways?  how many stuns or whatever would it take to get the mob off you by a knight?  oh yeah, they'd be taunting too, so I'd say they have at least twice the odds of getting aggro back... if they ever lost it in the first place.<br />
<br />
I dont think I do to bad, untill I group with knights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Uira Tawhaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">That pally heal is not going to save me, the stun will<br />
I think what Varaho is trying to say is they can use their heal to not only give you an hp boost but steal aggro as well, especially at close range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">/shield is very useful in experiance groups. Unfortunately without investing AA it can only be used once every other fight. Because of this, most Warriors that I know set up a hotkey so they can /shield their slower. I also set one for the Cleric and try to keep track of when they used DA last.<br />
<br />
The one time use every other fight is a severe limitation. If an Enchanter takes a big hit on a slow that doesn't stick, the Cleric heals them, and the Enchanter takes more damage I have no choice but to /shield them. If 10 seconds later the Cleric gets pounded, then I AE Taunt and hope for the best. On the next fight everyone better be careful, 'cause all I've got left is aggro weapons and a Taunt button.<br />
<br />
Contrast this with the Paladin who can with a single spell line (although often other spells are better choices) pull the mob, get ranged aggro, get snap aggro, build aggro, interrupt casting, slow the mob, and snare the mob. Add the ability to lull neaby mobs, Root, heal, 1300 AC and 6000 HP and you ought to be able to see what Warriors are competing with - a class twinked out by the designers.<br />
<br />
The truth is that Warriors have many severe disadvantages when they are exp group MT's. Despite this with the proper equipment, AA abilities, skill, and cooperation from others we can do the job.<br />
<br />
You've got it wrong chief - Warriors are bent but not broken.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>corillis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">When i play my warrior, i always use shield whenever a person other than me is getting hit.<br />
I love it, i even replaced my auto-attack button, that has been on macro 1 since release with it.<br />
<br />
My current main is a cleric, so i'm used to targeting people in the group, and the 'select last target' command, that i remapped to backspace gives me the flexibility to use shield without having to retarget the mob afterwards.<br />
<br />
My message, that goes with it is <br />
<br />
&quot;-SHIELDING- %T -STAY CLOSE TO ME-&quot;<br />
<br />
in say.<br />
<br />
Why in say? well, usually people notice things in caps faster, and even more when it's in say.<br />
I also always stand near the slower on inc, so that i can taunt the mob back if i lose aggro (range of taunt considered) and i can shield whenever it's needed.<br />
<br />
The only problem i have with shield is the following:<br />
<br />
Warriors are supposed to be the best mitigating / avoiding tanks there are. Well they are, really, but why do they get an ability that temporarily increases the mob's dps by 25% ?<br />
<br />
You take 75% of the hits (dmg) and the person you shield only takes 50%<br />
<br />
Total: 125%<br />
<br />
Now, if the mob resisted slow, and you get aggro, this is a problem.<br />
You want that 65% 70% or 75% slow on the mob.. why? because mobs in PoP hit so friggin hard. Slow is needed.<br />
But instead of slowing, you now haste the mob 25% (so to say)<br />
<br />
Also, /disc def doesn't work together with shield. That kinda sucks too. You defend another person, and you can't assume a defensive stance?<br />
<br />
All in all, i must admit, when i play my cleric, i prefer warriors. I've said so many times before, and i stick with it.<br />
But this new ability, if used properly puts warriors BACK on their spot of WHO'S YO DADDY ! (aka, the best tank class in the game)<br />
<br />
I'd love to see some aa's where the shielding goes to 50% / 50% instead of 75 / 50. maybe make it only cost 3 aa's or so.<br />
<br />
The only thing that my warrior needs to hold aggro a bit better is dps. This would be better in the long run, and still give knights that advantage over warriors on the snap aggro.<br />
<br />
Knights have their niche in snap aggro and aggro lock. I don't need it if I'm not dealing with total retards in my group. <br />
<br />
I have to agree with the thread starter.. /shield is a great ability, if used properly, but it has its downsides too. ('long' reuse, higher mob dps and incompatibility with /disc  def)<br />
<br />
Ah well, who knows if SOE changes the discs to be able to use them together with other discs, or even a protection disc, that shields everyone around you for 12 (with aa's : 24) secs at a 50:50 rate and you get a def-like stance, but instead of DB + .5*DI a DB + .7-ishDI<br />
<br />
I have some hope. Warriors need some fleshing out, some re-itemisation, but all-together, we're not that bad.<br />
We only have a serious image problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks for sharing your views, I'm glad to hear that even slowers don't think warriors are totally unwanted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Despite this with the proper equipment, AA abilities, skill, and cooperation from others we can do the job.<br />
OK, this seems to be the whole focus of this thread in one line, but lets honestly look at it. <br />
<br />
Warriors CAN  be effective in exp groups if we have 4 things:<br />
<br />
1) Sufficient equipment... this has always been the case to a certain degree with us and while it is frustrating at times its what we all accept.<br />
<br />
2) A certain level of skill... which is acceptable to me: we all want to play with smart/skilled players, not stupid idiots.<br />
<br />
3) A certain level of AAs... this is where I start to disagree: how does average warrior get a group to get his AAs?<br />
<br />
4) Cooperation from his groupmates... I have an issue with this, as well as it impacts on #2. The DPS elements in a group don't need to be skilled or cooperate much with a knight, because they won't gank aggro. With a warrior they are required to ride the edge.<br />
<br />
I don't even try for pick up groups anymore because I know that any short comings are blamed on my &quot;lack of skill&quot; rather than the ability of a group to realize where my limits are and scale back accordingly. It gets pretty old when a slower (who is used to slowing on contact instead of giving me 5-10% like I tell them) gets eaten and says &quot;that doesn't happen with a knight tanking&quot;.  We can argue all we want about how smart players can manage, but the bottom line is people are lazy and will try and default to the easiest situation: knights make exp grinds a lot easier for them than we do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Wilhelmm_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">&quot;Despite this with the proper equipment, AA abilities, skill, and cooperation from others we can do the job.&quot;<br />
<br />
- I have all my defensive AA's<br />
- I have almost all of my useful offensive AA's (only Flurry-3 at the moment, doing planar fury)<br />
- I use a Blade of War for agro, arguably the best agro setup in Everquest for warriors<br />
- I also have an orb of the sky, which adds an additional high-proccing DD/stun proc to my weapons<br />
- I have enough HP.AP that I can handle tanking a mob without a hurried slow or mandated early heal; both VERY troubling agro situations.<br />
<br />
What's my point? I'm Far from the average warrior. And you know what, I STILL have agro issues. I almost never group with rogues using the Mith Marr dagger because I basically am powerless against them; I can't always keep agro over them, even after a reasonable amount of time has elasped. If a slow is resisted often, as is sometimes the case, I often still can't do shit about it. Same goes for an early heal. Even with all of my boons, I still can't offer a group anywhere near the same kind of agro stability as a knight with even half my HP total, and 0 AA's.<br />
<br />
Now, if I still incur these problems while in an XP group, imagine what kind of shit a warrior without all of his offensive/defensive aa's, without a high-damage heavy agro weapon, and without the HP/AC edge that allows him to go for a while without a slow. Imagine what they have to go through, then please preach to me this bullshit about how warriors &quot;are balanced.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The whole point of the whole issue can be wrapped up in a single sentence:<br />
<br />
&quot;Warriors want either to give groups a reason to withhold their effectivenss ganking aggro, or the tools to overcome it.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's not that hard, and it's impossible to argue that either is a bad thing.</div></div><hr />
