<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope, they can't take you above the hard cap on skills.<br />
<br />
BUT they can take you to the hard cap.<br />
<br />
What's this mean?<br />
<br />
This means the + Taunt % mod on the helmet from Grieg's is good, because it does add a modifier to taunt for a warrior.<br />
<br />
This means that the + hand to hand % mod on the gloves from Vex Thal is valueless to a monk, because a monk is already at 252 hand to hand skill and it can't go higher.<br />
<br />
At least that's what I've been told by friends, guildmates and strangers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uukla</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The consensus on the tradeskill boards is that skills are capped due to programming at either 250 / 252 or 255.  2 ^ 8 is 256, so the theory is that skills can go from 0 to 255, but that the values 255, 254 and 253 are reserved values.  (like before you can learn the skill, you have a skill of 253, which tells the system you cant learn the skill yet, etc)<br />
<br />
So the thinking is that first off, the highest mod works.  This has been proven with tests from picklock, where a certain skill level is needed to open certain doors, and the tests were conclusive.  (as long as picklock works the same as other skills).<br />
Then, if a skill maxes below 250, then modifier numbers appear to help, although I dont know what the quantitative effect would be of 4 percent more taunt or 8 percent more dodge would be.</div></div><hr />
