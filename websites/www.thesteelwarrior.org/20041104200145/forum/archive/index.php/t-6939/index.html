<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slovack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What  do ya'll think of this weapon? Ornate Stone Battle Hammer  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=45132) I picked one up today but havent had the time to play with it too much. Heck for the decent stats it'll at leist make a good play toy. Maybe even come in usefull against AE mobs? who knows.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do a search of these forums for &quot;Splitblade of Destruction&quot; and read what people say about it.  The Ornate Stone Battlehammer is a Splitblade of Destruction with inferior DPS.  The proc has no aggro.  The effect only lasts a couple ticks so it's almost never up when you need it, and even then, it only has a 15% chance of doing its thing.  It only reflects effects that a player could cast - so if you think you'll reflect Aaryonar's breath or Oreen Wavecrasher's proc back at him, think again.</div></div><hr />

(unless you can trick a fool into buying it for something else than ratio/hp)</div></div><hr />

I really like this comment. Perfectly said.</div></div><hr />

The reflection rate isn't even close to 15%, when I tested it.  It's a great idea but doesn't work as often as it should.  I tested it in Acrylia Caverns on my BST due to the large number of casters in the zone.  During 489 casts on me, 9 were reflected successfully ( even then, the mob can and will resist their own spell) for a rate of 1.84% :\  It reflected a few cleric nukes and roots but once I reflected a necro nuke / illusion: skeleton spell (pic attached)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>DG-Slider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, maybe they will nerf this weapon and make it decent. I think it is a really cool idea to rebound spells. I have one banked just in case they make a good change. Other then that, I haven't weilded the thing once.</div></div><hr />
