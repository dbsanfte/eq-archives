<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jello56</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am one of the unfortunate ones to get screwed over when I made my warrior 3 years ago when diety meant squat, so now I am wondering what armor has similar stats/ease of attaining as FH? The other small catch is that I am not in any guild and dont plan on being in one for a bit and the only help I can probably get is from a monk/druid 2 boxer (I can 2 box a 65 mage myself) and a former Afterlife ranger. If the only decent upgrades is LDoN armor (which may as well be much to my dismay), which camps would you consider hitting up first to get decent/quick upgrades? You can see by my magelo that I am in quite a bit of need of upgrades   :( <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">EF has a nice set of armor for 760 points each, far superior than the FH imo (Malevolent).<br />
<br />
You could get some SS armor, but you need more ppl to go to HoT or maybe buy some MQs?<br />
Stat wise is better I think but its not as easy to attain as to drop by in bazaar and buy a piece of armor.</div></div><hr />

TH bracers with a 40hp aug ain't that bad....but overall just go do some LDoN.<br />
<br />
and if you're considering SS armour; go for Kael/Warlords.......but LDoN is your best options methinks</div></div><hr />

HoT armor IS one groupable...but I've only done it with a slower.</div></div><hr />

TH is comparable or even superior (in the resist dept.) than Myrmidon's tho ( with some normal_level LDoN augs ) .. i was all mixed and matched with SS/TH/Kizrak's .... thing is TH is pretty cheap too depending on server (that is; if you can even find it )<br />
<br />
but definately; if you're sub-velious in gear HoT is the easiest ticket to gear up..out of the velious expansion Warlords is about stat for stat the closest to a FH grade of armor you'll get in regards to questable gear sets...which in turn is about moot if you can advance in getting a lot of LDoN in with some friends plus some decent experience and drops to boot <br />
<br />
Go for your EF LDoN and you'll make out nicely out of all the above choices.</div></div><hr />
