<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 11:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a couple of alts that I play. And I play on one of the original release, up for 4.5 years servers, Povar. <br />
<br />
I had noticed, that even with the enhanced LFG tools, and pick up group support that LDoN gives, lately I have been having a very hard time finding groups for my 20's and 30's toons. So I finally did a /who all 28 on a Wednesday night, about 10 PM EST, and there were 6 characters at that level. There were 20 1st level characters, 14 of whom were bazaar bots. At the same time, there were 20 65th non-annon bard on.<br />
<br />
So, I am a tad frustrated and worried about the complete and utter lack of low characters around. Can you imagine picking up EQ now, and trying to level for the first time? I think the challenge of either soloing all the way though, or just trying to find groups would get you to switch games or all out quit. <br />
<br />
As an experiment, I popped over to stromm, and that was not much better...there were 20 20th level toons. Currently, with the large number of points needed in LDoN for good gear and the number of AAs that a 65th toon want/needs SOE seems to have cut the heart out of alting that was common and allowed the true new comers to get groups. I wonder if EQ is going to suffer greatly for not having enough low level characters around to support new players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gharghael</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 12:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well considering that new characters now start with a bag, spells scribed and memmed, hotkeys made, sense heading maxed, in-game maps, etc, etc, the time it takes someone to level up a new character has been reduced drastically. There's no learning curve anymore. Might this be why we have so many level 65 characters who don't have a fucking clue?<br />
<br />
But in all seriousness, I have noticed a similar trend Kailyn. I play on Fennin Ro, always have, and I have a lot of alts also. Most of my current alts are around 15-20, with a couple around 40ish, and though they aren't really what I'd call soloing classes, they sure end up soloing a lot. =-/ Maybe I'm not hip with the popular leveling zones these days or something, but I hardly ever see lowbies that aren't being powerleveled. =- |<br />
I don't know if this signifies the end of all that is EQ, but it certainly is something to ponder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 02:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, most people on Povar aren't in their 20s for long Kailyn.<br />
<br />
Paludal Caverns has seen to that.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
I get what you're saying. But on the flipside, I've had a few friends recently start up on Povar. And they levelled up fine. The grind didn't really hit them until their 50s.<br />
<br />
The 50s still suck. Always have. Probably always will.<br />
<br />
But the 20s? Man, they're fun for a LOT of people. The level of gear available for pennies on Povar to a level 20 is pretty damn staggering compared to what I used to wear/wield at that level.<br />
<br />
Even some of the melees can keep right on soloing until the mid-30s or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Venz</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 08:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play on Fennin also Gharg....and yeah the power-leveling is totally and sickeningly rampant. Another group i love so much, are the people who level and hunt exclusively in Ldon, where normal dungeon rules dont really apply (wtf is crowd control?) then on raids and such they have no concept of /assist and cc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's only because they get buffed to the eyeteeth before going in and twink out huge. The other day I took my 29 BL into Tak with 4 guildies in the low 30's - No Virt, no c3. The monk got a LOT better at split pulling after the first time he brought 5. :D Plus, in the 90 minutes we spent in the dungeon, I pulled half my level. That's damn fine XP and a hell of a lot more fun than static camps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I blame AA points.<br />
<br />
If those didn't exist the amount of lower level toons ( albeit mostly twinks ) would increase exponentially</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heimdall-RN</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've two box'ed a cleric/enc duo lately and have no problems.  PC wasn't packed but there were enough people to group with.  After that I hit HHK, still one of the most popular for its level, and I've split time there with time in DSP.  That place always has groups going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have not seen low level characters around in much abundance in a couple years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">radalas</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 10:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because 65 is the cap level, you really cant really use that as a judgement tool.<br />
<br />
If you are able to do /who all bard 65 with 54 aa's then im sure you will see the same type of number you will see with lvl28s.<br />
<br />
Granted there are a lot of power levelers out there, I think theres still a healthy number of lower level alts/newbies out there.<br />
<br />
Maybe try a /who all 28-34?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">12-15-2003, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The moron farm (Paludal) is still going strong on Sol Ro.  Lots of alts but some genuine newbies as well.  Not as many though.  I wandered into DL a month or so ago and there was one group on ridge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 02:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, these days the line seems to be something akin to this :<br />
<br />
Newbie zone --&gt; Paludal Cavern bugside --&gt; Paludal Cavern Bandit camp side --&gt; Dawnshroud Peaks --&gt; Dreadlands --&gt; Karnors Castle / Pland of Justice basement --&gt; Plane of Nightmares/Plane of Innovation --&gt; Plane of Valor<br />
<br />
With a smattering of going here and there and offcourse LDoN adventures. Not sure how much LDoN makes people take different levelling routes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doggabone</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 07:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">arf arf<br />
<br />
My alts skip the PC crowds for LDoN now, and I don't notice if it's any slower.  Tho it's harder to find a group at 20 - 30 for LDoN it seems, I have absolutely no trouble with a trio in LDoN at that range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raznok Razorwit</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">was spending some time leveling my alt BST in sola recently...I had the entire zone to myself for about 3 days not counting a coupla hours when a druid came in to PL an SK friend.<br />
<br />
The game is out of balance for low lvls anymore....skyrocket from 1 to 50 and then can't play when ya get there.  There aren't many low characters cuz they just don't stay low long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tierleaf</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can certainly see alot of people not playing warrior clerics and rogues after a whle as genuine new players, they would give up with no one else to play with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not really a problem because with the cheap twink gear in the bazaar they can easily solo into their 40s if necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheGiantOne</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm..<br />
<br />
Also on Povar and have to agree with ya Kailyn.  Gone are the days where it took months to get to level 50 at the beginning of this world.<br />
<br />
But whats happening as another person put it you can basically race up to level 50 then you run into a rut unless you have a nice small bot army which a lot of people do.<br />
<br />
There are less NEW folks coming into the lands.  The main part of EQ now is made of of:<br />
<br />
1.  Old timers like us who refuse to quit.<br />
<br />
2.  Old timers who have now also made up 20+ alts but who can use a small bot army to get their alts even to 65 (if for any reason just to say they have done it)  Most of those who needed the alts or wanted to do this have done so now.<br />
<br />
3.  Old timers who have sold their level 65 accounts (ouch)  to others who wouldn;t have even a 1% idea on how to really play that particular character or class.<br />
<br />
4.  The last part is a very small percentage which is actual NEW PLayers in the lands of EQ who have never played the game before.<br />
<br />
So you ask what are the percentages?<br />
<br />
Okay these are just approximates as I have seen many people come and go from the lands of Povar.  Match these to the above # descriptions above.<br />
<br />
1.  15%<br />
2.  40%<br />
3.  35%<br />
4.  10%<br />
<br />
The good news if you want to call it that is at least 1/2 of the old timers are still around in some form.<br />
<br />
The bad news is that little by little their accounts will either go poof by Number 3  reason above or just plain quit. <br />
<br />
Some of you may be right as time goes by those percentages in #1 and #2 will become smaller than #3 and #4.<br />
<br />
The changes are being made in the lands but alas people are eating the changes alive in just a few months rather than taking 1 year until the next expansion comes out. <br />
<br />
This will mean it will take an advertising feat that hasn't been seen in years in rpg games to revive EQ.  Maybe this is what LDoN and Expansion in Feb will do..only time will tell.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just my 2 cents,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Connir</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I just switched servers and made a warrior on lanys server. We all had level 65 raiding toons on our previous server. My wife and brother did the same thing. We have a warrior, cleric, enchanter, and monk. So we pretty much only need a few supporting classes or just go with what we have.<br />
<br />
We switched about 3 weeks ago and are creeping up on 40. Didn't get much play time with holidays. We went through PD of course and are now doing LDON and OT for exp.<br />
<br />
There is usually 3-4 groups in OT when we are exping and I have come across a few NEW players. They are very easy to spot.<br />
<br />
&lt;li&gt;No assist key<br />
&lt;li&gt;their pets attack before the mobs even get to camp<br />
&lt;li&gt;5 line hotkey messages<br />
&lt;li&gt;if they are a melee class they add tank everything, even with a chanter mezzing<br />
&lt;li&gt;they root mobs that run when they are able to cast snare<br />
<br />
At least on this new server I am playing on their seems to be a few new players, enough to keep the game going it seems.<br />
<br />
But leveling seems to be slowing down a little for us right now, maybe it's the zones we are in?<br />
<br />
If anyone has any suggestions for level 35 and up zones let me know. We have an iksar in group and like to remain kinda close to books or non kos cities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heimdall-RN</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Plain and Simple, EQ is a long long ways away from Death.  EQ2 is closer to death than EQ 1 is.  The simple fact is proven by SWG, and Planetside.  The Developers still haven't learned the lessons they should have learned from every expansion they've put out for EQ, and every competitor's product.  Look at SWG.  They FUBAR'ed a ton of that release from what I've heard.  Look at the expansion releases.  I just don't see enough people wanting to pay SoE to beta test another game until it gets to the &quot;broken in&quot; state that EQ1 is at.  We found the bugs.  We suffered the exploits, and griefing- until SoE fixed the bugs, and nerfed the opportunities for people to grief you.</div></div><hr />
