<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am really begining to think that the lack of continutiy in people who know these systems well is soon going to require a massive rebalancing fo EQ from high to low.<br />
<br />
Wizards 1-50 have been badly hurt by mudflation. There is not a heck of a lot you can do to twink a wizard. Once you are OOM, you are OOM. 51+ish I would buy that their spell selection sucks. As I understand it they have a very Flat damage progression though the RoK levels. (The pets of the other classes at least help the other robed casters, though melee is massively mudflated 1-50.)<br />
<br />
Agro issues...we know about.<br />
<br />
DW--a skill that is in for doing damage, breaks at high levels. I have not read first hand, but per some studies at Rangers Glade, very high attack ratings (1700+) ATK gives less increase for 1h than it does for 2h. (The nubmers given were about 10 / 1DPS until soft cap, then about 50 atk / 1 DPS for 1h, while for 2h, they found the soft cap is higher and once over the cap the ratio changes to about 30 to 1.)<br />
<br />
The continual addition of uber arch type gear in stead of class gear, closing the reletive differances between classes where the gaps were supposed to be part of the balance between them.<br />
<br />
The continuing de-emphasis of defensive and the addition of items with sheilding on them--which works on DB and DI, not just DI like defensive.<br />
<br />
The addition of old style FD to bards, making them the premier pullers in the game.<br />
<br />
And reading the FoH boards can be a real eyeopener. They seem to be playing a comepletely different game than us mere mortals. <br />
<br />
Oh and offically the HP differance between Pali's and warriors has been closed to 0% in PoT.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of these problems are caused by the dev's not having a deep understanding of the systems the are design for. And a lack of strong analytical tools to look at reletive values.</div></div><hr />

<br />
or...<br />
<br />
is it the men in the black helicopters that are doing this intentionally so we will all go to EQ 2?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh.  I'm winning a convert ;-)<br />
<br />
Seriously though I think Kailyn that:<br />
<br />
1. EQ has been commercially successful despite &quot;crapulance&quot; (simpsons term)....the ability to throw in quantity of new material without really thoroughly QAing how it interacts with the existing material.  EQ has QUANTITY OVER QUALITY as a guiding mantra.<br />
<br />
Only when users see wholes the size you can drive trucks through (&quot;OMG you mean only 500 people can use the bazaar at a time?&quot;  or &quot;OMG the plane of time is dependant on 18 member groups while the rest of the guild sits &amp; watches?&quot;) are things addressed.  Doesn't make it a bad game...after all its entertainment.<br />
<br />
2. The sense of char distictiveness is more derived now from where you are at in PoP progression, gear etc than what class you play.  And you know what...the game is still fun even if it means the role your char plays can be taken over by another class.<br />
<br />
3. EQ has hit a point where its more of a cash cow than anything else.  So I'd imagine retuning/understanding all the logic on the part of the developers is kinda a low priority (hey if it aint broke why fix it?).<br />
<br />
/shrug I've posted too much today.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EQ's game mechanics and player/character designs = totally borked beyond all terms of relative sensibility.<br />
<br />
EQ's marketing and rate of addiction and amount of time that exponentially increases to accomplish a task and to keep it's players logged in = pure fucking genius.<br />
<br />
I wish I had stock in VI. I'd be a millionaire and laughing right along with them straight to the bank.<br />
<br />
We're only 1 class out of, how many? 16? The other 15 are happy the more the content and abilities become added onto. They're doing something right.</div></div><hr />

after all those guys made the game we fell in love with</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope. EQ at release was rediculously hard. There are some friendlyness improvements that have been made to EQ that I think would have never happened under the vision.<br />
<br />
Heck, you think the differences between knights and warriors is narrow now, at release the differances in HP/AC (potential or attainable) and attack were close enouhg to be non-existant between rangers and warriors was even smaller. At all levels.<br />
<br />
Can they do it again? Maybe. Do I think the last best hope for balance...<br />
<br />
no way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yall seem to think that the &quot;vision&quot; was actually a real concrete concept, as opposed to merely a PR tool used to justify doing (or not doing) whatever they felt like.  <br />
<br />
There was a fairly nice link to a presentation by one of the EQ folks at a game designer website/mud on &quot;how to make a successful mmorpg&quot;, and one of the items was basically &quot;control the preceptions of the players however necessary, but always make practical decisions regardless of what you say/have said&quot;.<br />
<br />
i.e. the &quot;vision&quot; was a scapegoat, noble sounding but obscure excuse for them to do whatever they did (or didn't) feel like doing.<br />
<br />
Having said all that, MAN was EQ class balance totally borked at release or what?  Warriors were basically EXACTLY the same as rangers... but we didn't get spells.  Or tracking.  Or dedicated weapons (mistwalker anyone?).  Rangers were *the* uber melee class 1-50; dual wielding yak/EBW with a CoF + lustrious russet (or rubi) armor, snaring doting sowing leving DSing nuking asskickers of tunare...<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And then they released kunark :b</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL why Valeris? We old timers scaring you?<br />
<br />
It was up hill, both ways, in the snow. Since we are using computer logic, it was quite possible.<br />
<br />
No I don't think there was a real concrete vision--deserving of the name &quot;Vision&quot; but I do think they had some guidelines and somethings that they JUST WOULD NOT DO. Is SoE more responcive than before? Yeah. Do they seem to be developing institutional wisdom? Nope.<br />
<br />
I don't think we would see some of the crazyness we are seeing now, epseically in PoT. Where do you go with drops from here? <br />
<br />
Nor do I think you would see an expantion that so totally screws melee on gearing up better. (Don't raid, don't get gear!)<br />
<br />
I just think SoE needs a tatoo planced on the dev's privates or forehead (privates would be better, they would see it every time they use the john) &quot;Says the rising magic tide does not raise the melee boat! &quot; and &quot;Levels + spells &gt; Levels.&quot; They completely seem to have forgotten that spell upgrades are suposed to be rare for hybrids, not ever or everyother level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok old timers what was the first bone they threw us...was it:<br />
<br />
1. Critical hits<br />
2. Crafted armor<br />
3. Beserk-no death crawl<br />
4. extra hit points <br />
5. None of the above<br />
<br />
Man we did suck back then heh :).  There was zero difference between us Rangers, Paldins or SKs. <br />
<br />
Personally I loved the old game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ooh oooh oh! I remember!<br />
<br />
I loved getting the beserk anti-death crawl.<br />
<br />
And being asked what it ment when I got it (in unrest, I was 14-15-14-15-14-15-14-15-....at the time (I lost 15th 15 times and 16th another 12 or so...but I still love unrest)).<br />
<br />
LOL I said it means RUN!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">07-12-2003, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ahh the good old days when orc pawns where uber exp when we could run freely throughout ec looking at all the uber stuff for sale when we could be on our toes against any orcs knowing it would be a close match. i really miss those days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-13-2003, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually one of the good things we ARE missing from those days, is the outdoor zone equalizers: EF was about the only major outdoor zone that did not have some really big mobs wondering it (Ice Boned Skeletons were about the top). Part (though only part) of the problem of modern EQ is that there are no wondering death mobs in the outdoor zones (Griffs, giants, etc) to make you wish for the safty of a doungon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">07-13-2003, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, the normal experience mobs are the wandering death mobs instead.  And they're equally as dangerous everywhere.  No point in trying to go into a dungeon where there is little loot and even more casters than outside.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalp Bungabunga</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 12:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Although on one level I completely agree marketing has taken over all forms of entertainment .. and hell whos gonna get mad because its a vicious unstoppable cycle but lets talk plain here. <br />
<br />
 I say we work together and use them against themselves becaus ei sure the hell didn't play a game for so long just to escape from this exact same BS. I want revenge. I say they wanna just throw us in the &quot;not money of the minute file ?&quot;<br />
<br />
We need to strike back.<br />
Screw Verant and SCREW Sony lets make em pay. Yea sure its just a game but how many of you have invested enough hours into your character to have gotten 2 PHDs?<br />
<br />
They owe us. So lets return fire we hold the life pulse to their operation. We ARE their cash flow and there has to be something short of giving up the game that we can do to show them exactly how completely thoughtless and wicked they are.<br />
<br />
I know this sounds completely psychotic, but check the facts . And lets organize a plan better than bitching, begging and crossing our fingers while we whine on a website about the unjustified truth they have abused their customer base to the point of revolt.<br />
<br />
Yalp<br />
and damn pissed off, gimme a beer im gonna go cornhole me a couple of corporate empires.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">um if you want to pl a wiz what you do is get him high ac/hp gear and good weapon. Stick ds on him and let him poke the shit out of mobs also anyone who thinks 1-50 wiz is underpowered never played one...<br />
<br />
let me tell ya a story I had pretty well twinked monk back in kunark days that lvl 44 monk could not solo a named in varsilik... I log on my lvl 34 wiz and own that named with 0 trouble and wiz had gheto gear. Also dont forget kei days. Wiz with kei 1-50 can solo for more xp then any other damn class in the game(that xp better then most of groups). Mana efficient nukes with criticals, quad kites... Do not underestimate power of wizzard or any 1-50 caster for a matter of fact.<br />
<br />
As for dualwield its still does fine dps with right weapon setup it just ts much easier to get 1 good 2 handed weapon then 2 good 1 handers. One handers still proc more, flurry more and crit more.</div></div><hr />
