<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Over at Graffee's there is a thread where people are claiming that in LDoN's warriors are out DPSing wizards. <br />
<br />
I got tired of arguing otherwise, someone go overthere and expalin that warriors DPS is nothing compared to wizards.... <br />
<br />
http://www.graffe.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=12772&amp;perpage=20&amp;pagenumber=3<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe I should not have linked to DBoW/EoE DPS....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why, did the poor wittle weezurds pwn teh mighty deathwalker?<br />
<br />
I thought you were always right, that should be more than enough for anyone to believe you for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's possible. Melees have the edge against casters in groups that move often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Have never done any parsing, but I have heard wizards say if their group knew how little damage they do in LDoN we wouldn't group with them.  LDoN is a worst-case scenario for wizards, steady stream of mobs, no downtime, moving a lot, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can make the math.<br />
<br />
The melee dps is alltime there when the mob is near.  You can look at the 10 hour parses unbuffed with dps of Melees between 85 and 180. Warrior made there 110 to 120 dps in a stream of 10 hours.<br />
<br />
A wizard can only make the dps as his mana will regenerate. His manapool will only help him in the first seconds. So when he has a manaregeneration of 96 per tic = 16 per second and his spell can dish out 6 dmg per 1 mana he will have a dps of 96. in this I will forget resists and crits.<br />
<br />
I dunno exactly if a Wizard can regen 96 mana per tic over 10 hours indoor but he must make 7.5 dmg per 1 mana to fit the 120 dps when he regens mana at this rate and thats not so easy as it looks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As always, when you're talking about total damage done (or even total dps over a long period of time) casters will fall behind.<br />
<br />
If they look at a per-mob basis i bet the wizard is destroying the warrior. Overall though I wouldn't be surprised if a warriors total damage done in an adventure is more than a wizards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The only issue here is that wizards have no semi-permanent source of damage like every other pure caster class does.<br />
<br />
From a balance perspective, I would have scrapped the class and given mages ports and spellshield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sylas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">another thing that no one really considers, is when the mob is down to less than 10%, say has 1k hps left, and the wizard lands that 6k+ crit, his DPS counts that 6k damage, but the melee who lands the quad + kick/backstab/FK for 1200 dmg still would have slain the mob.  The last hit for a melee is the only hit that skews his DPS, yet the wizard's last nuke get skewed completely.<br />
<br />
so if a warrior has done say 200k dmg over 45 min LDON, and has landed 30 killing blows, his DPS is skewed by say 30X avg hit (say 100 damage), for 3k.<br />
<br />
but if a wizard has done 300k dmg over 45 min LDON, and has landed 30 killing blows, his DPS is skewed by 30 X avg nuke, say 3k, or 90k.<br />
<br />
assuming that half of the dmg dealt was necessary to finish off the mob, the warrior gets 1.5k &quot;fake&quot; damage added to his DPS total, while the wizard gains 45k &quot;fake&quot; damage added.<br />
<br />
another way to say it is, if you killed 90 mobs and each mob has 10k hps, then your total group damage total should be 900k, but with nukers the total group damage is closer to 1.1-1.5M.  against a raid mob that last nuke going over the total HPs left of the mob is no big deal, so the overnuke doesn't mean anything.  But in exp groups where you are killing a mob a minute for 5 hours straight, then it adds up big.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>tatanka7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, assuming no bard in the group:<br />
<br />
Standing regen = 3 (at 65), FT = 15, MC = 3, KEI = 14, Pot9 = 8, that totals 43 per tick, familiars add some, not sure about WIZ self-buffs, also they can get some from using Harvest, so let's say 50-55 mana per tick if there's no bard in the group and they never med.<br />
<br />
They don't use much, if any, mana for buffs, heals, etc, so if they don't root or snare, it all goes to nukes.  Top Druid nuke efficiency (including crits) is roughly 7.5, so let's say for wizzies it's 9.  55 mana/tick = 9.16 mana/sec * 9 dmg/mana = 82 DPS.<br />
<br />
If there's a bard in the group, or they med some, or add beastlord buff, or better chanter buff (Tranq, VoQ) and it can go up from there.  Less FT, etc, and it goes down a bit.  So I'd say 60-120 DPS is probably a reasonable assumption for sustainable damage output for wizzies in LDoN.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Gee ... <br />
<br />
I wonder how useful Rogues (who do constant steady DPS and can open tons of chests and scout ahead real easy) are in LDoN?<br />
<br />
I wonder how useful Monks (who do constant steady DPS and can pull and can offtank) are in LDoN?<br />
<br />
Odd how dungeon crawling favors the classes that always liked to dungeon crawl isn't it?<br />
<br />
Wonder when the rest of Norrath will catch on to something anyone who camped Raster has known since pre-Kunark.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Offcourse, the Wizard have the option of unloading on one MOB if need be and do some serious damage for a short time, saving the group from a CR.<br />
<br />
A Melee is harsd pressed to do that .. on demand at least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I find it kind of amusing that you linked a parse from Furor, who is one of the best equipped warrior in the game, to try to prove that warriors don't outdamage wizards.<br />
<br />
Fully buffed, a warrior with Furor's gear will easily outdamage 90% of the wizards who post at Graffes over a 1 hour period 8)<br />
<br />
(Hint: the parse is unbuffed and unattended, i.e. missing 60% haste, 30% overhaste, 400 ATK, kick or slam, damage shield damage, any disciplines etc )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">A Wizard can solo 100 times better than a Warrior, do we do 100 times the DPS in LDoN? Soloing ability=grouping utility, so how is a Warrior out-DPSing in a group compared to a quad kiting class unbalanced?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It's all about da blue stuff and how quick it goes up or down</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The DPS from them isn't stellar, but don't forget that wizzies also have a few mana-free nuke/rend items that let them dish out sustained ranged dmg in low mana situations... might not help much in LDON, but on the old marathon mob kills it really added up.  And for burst dps, the ele legs let wizzies totally blow away any other class I'm familiar with.<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">it is so, but a war can't take one mob and drop 7398dd in 6.2 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Funny I have never run the wizzard out of mana in LDoN if they are properly buffed before we start. I would be very surprised there are any situations where warrior DPS (Or total damage) out does a similarly geared wizard's DPS (or total damage) over time. Even long encounters, provided a couple of buffers are there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mourningloree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">That just means they weren't nooking enough...  If any class has mana at the end of an adventure they weren't trying hard enough and being more aggressive in their casting would have decreased the time it took to do the adventure.  My cleric usually finishes at around 20% or so and gets a condemnation or two off each fight.<br />
With the new cleric gather mana AAs coming, I expect to try to finish OOM and use gather mana for the unexpected cases where I need more mana then I anticpiated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">LDoN is murder on a wizards mana bar.  I have botted my 65 wiz thru quite a few (she only has FT1, the level 65 familiar, IMP DMG IV, Haste of Solusek and Mana Pres IV with around 4400 mana) and even with VOQ she can easily go nearly OOM every 4-5 mobs.  In addition mobs  aren't usually fully debuffed in an exp/LDoN situation, and sometimes can resist more, even tho the melee are still whittling it down.  Add a 6k+ mana elemental wizard and maybe they last 8 mobs?   Add a bard and it's a different story, however, mana is near limitless with bard mana regen going.<br />
<br />
  Wizards do have a limited mana regain tool called Harvest and Harvest of Druzzil (HoD is an AA), it gains them back around 800 mana every 10 minutes.. enough for a few extra nukes.</div></div><hr />
