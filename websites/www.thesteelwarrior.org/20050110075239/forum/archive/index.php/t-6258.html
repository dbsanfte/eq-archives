<br />
first try, we TM/Mezed the 4 adds she frist spawns, and then killed the DTadds while tanking shei with like 5 wars...<br />
<br />
2nd try we got some bad info, that if you killed 3 of the first 4 adds, they woudlnt repop when you spawned the real Shei<br />
<br />
do the 4 adds always repop when they die?<br />
<br />
how do other people hand the adds...an army or mezers/kiters and have all dps on shei?  weve only had 2 enc's able to show up both times, so i know we lacking there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">03-21-2004, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">pull fake (merchant shei)<br />
<br />
kill all of the guards that spawn when merchant is aggroed, kill merchant last<br />
<br />
once real shei is spawned send someone to eat the DT<br />
<br />
5 mobs will spawn in his room, pull them all out with a bard and have them fade<br />
<br />
kill all 5 mobs then send the second DT bait in (we have an enchanter tash and slow and then get DT)<br />
<br />
once chanter dies MA rushes and calls assist ect, switch tanks when they get DTed, have pallies offtank adds</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When we did it we always had a monk kite the initial adds in the next room and then had an add killing group with a tank, cleric, and a couple rogues to take care of the ones that spawned from DT's.  Everybody else on Shei.  We would pull and kill fake Shei, then the monk would run in and aggro all the adds (I think they could do it without getting DT'd but I'm not sure) and then we all ran in and beat down shei when the adds were out of the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shei's DT is not an old world type DT: It is only a 20k nuke, rather than a true death touch. This means that Shei's touch can be blocked by HS/DA: Use Pal/SKs for the pulls around real Shei, it's rooted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goyan</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't you get the 4 big arm guys down to 10% each, kill Shei and then kill them?  Should be Shei with no adds up except the new mobs from DT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krassus</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">have anyone with snare group with a mage and go alone into Shei room, snare merchant shei and run towards zone in. The 4 adds spawn and chase you and Shei is snared, once adds are out of room just get cothed. Adds never repop they just sit there far unagro. Kill merchant shei in prep room then send in DA pally or a gimp to eat DT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scrab1</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always just had a bard DA, pull the adds to the north room and leave them there.  They corpse camp.<br />
<br />
As for shei himself just have an SK lead the charge with harmshield.  Right after he sees shei cast the DT have him Harmtouch and darkness shei.  Warrior runs in, AET, and inherits 10k aggro or so.  Have all the casters stand on the wall behind shei (to avoid the trap) and blaze away till they're OOM.<br />
<br />
Now that the warrior can also furious an unslowed shei that should add another couple K to their head start aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't bother with switching to a warrior on Shei, let alone using furious hehe, she is fully slowable and weak anyway.  We used monks to tank her even back in Luclin, I'm sure an enchanter or a wizard could tank her these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froggerx Xreggorf</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 01:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fact or Fiction? i've heard that a divine stun chain from pallies can result in no DT's at all, just the 4 initial spawns?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 03:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you stun, it only delays the cast iirc, but if you could keep him perma stunned it might work.  Consider divine stun lasts 1 second, and has a 9 second reuse (with max aa, with no reduction aa it's 30 seconds).  Believe it has a 1.5 second cast time.  You would need either very good timing pallys, or just a lot to do it.  But you really don't need to be gimp like that, it's an easy fight anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wudedorm</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">baqh we just pull fake out, kill adds then fake, send in sacrifice charge fast to max time before DT offtank adds, switch tanks until she dead kill adds. we lose 2 tanks generally(hoping to get it to 1 DT soon)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Coolest Shei fight we ever did was one where our first tank was timing the DT and would back out of the fight right before it went off and someone else would eat it.  That was the l33test feat of MTing I have ever seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinekus Aleswig</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">He is stunnable and his DT can be interupted.  Best way to deal with the adds is after he respawns, have a monk train them out and either zone or FD while you kill Shei.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pling</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Clear area around Shei (vendor is dubious).<br />
2. Put raid in north room.<br />
3. Bard aggro Shei and Fade when he see the 4 guards.<br />
4. Monk aggro the 4 guards and train them to IV somewhere, FD, get CotH (or wait 8 minutes for them to depop).<br />
5. Raid move into Sheis room. Put Manausers in south alkove away from ae drain. Designate corpsedragger+resser+buffers for MTs.<br />
6. Engage Vendor shei at spawn, place a DA-capable sacrifice on carpet where real Shei will spawn. <br />
7. JUST before vendor shei dies, sacrifice does DA and /sit on carpet and eat 20k-nuke.<br />
8. MT jumps down and engages, slowers slow. <br />
9. After 2 minutes Shei will 20k-nuke MT. Next MT take aggro. A Pally or something engage the add. ALL dps on add until dead. Repeat 9 until Shei dead.<br />
<br />
The 20k-nuke is interruptable with Pally/Cleric lvl 65 stuns. Just VERY hard to time it right.<br />
<br />
Pull the DT-adds to middle of south wall so nukers inside south alkove can nuke without needing to step outside and eat manadrain.<br />
<br />
thats it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crystara</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 11:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol I used to time shei DT as well and let someone else eat it, was so fun.</div></div><hr />
