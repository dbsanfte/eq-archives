<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dacke</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 02:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well not an expert here but i would say your ac looks a bit low, but i see no defense value in magelo so the ac number might be way of,  take a look at my magelo of my 42 war, perhaps some of my items are usable by iksars to.<br />
<br />
Some of the items i found in bazaar rather cheaply  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 07:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really don't know much about lizard armor, so hmm...<br />
You didn't ask, but I'd consider switching out your offhand weapon. Go through all your one-handers and figure out which has the best damage:delay ratio, and stick that in your offhand. Don't just look at total damage; and factor in recommended level numbers.<br />
I would say that the AC on your items is a bit low in general; you'll be wanting to upgrade soon. Start searching the bazaar by race, class, slot, CT religion and your budget, and you'll get an idea what's out there that you can wear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warhead42</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have no idea what your budget is, but it appears that you fell into the same trap that I did when I first started out.<br />
<br />
Strength is not the best thing to work on.  Yes, it helps, but as a warrior, your primary responsibilities are survivability and aggro generation.<br />
<br />
The formula for deciding what gear is best for a warrior to use (as has been posted on this board repeatedly, I'm just regurgitating it =) is the 1 AC = 6 HP = 1 STA formula.  Since you're level 37, a point of STA isn't going to increase your hp by 6, it should be somewhere closer to 4, so substitute 4 for that 6 in HP until you get higher up.<br />
<br />
Some things I recommend:<br />
Velium Fire Wedding Ring (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4243):  300-400pp<br />
Black Sapphire Electrum Earring (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1919):  750-1000pp (you can forgo these if you don't have the platinum)<br />
Black Sapphire Platinum Necklace (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1149):  1000-1500pp<br />
<br />
Basically do what the other folks have suggested, check the bazaar and check for your race/class/deity, sort by AC or HP and find the best bang for your buck.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions or need anything, I'm on Torvo as well, so feel free to ask me =)  I'm not uber or anything, but I definitely came from the same path you're on now, and hopefully my experience can help you through it.</div></div><hr />

Aye, you could use some work, but it all depends on how deep your pockets are.  If you have any resources, how much do you have to work with?  I can come up with a pretty reasonable set of upgrades you can buy based on that.  Other than that, at your level, upgrades will take some higher level friends to get you some stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say your gear looks a little weak, but honestly, do you care? Are you dieing too fast? Are you still able to get xp? Do people whine about grouping with you? If not, don't worry too much. Do some ldons, you might get some upgrade drops, which is more fun than having to sell everything because you bought stuff thats better in the bazaar. <br />
<br />
Nonetheless, as you get some pp, you might look for crustacean shell armor in the bazaar for your visible slots for 50pp or less per piece. Those will be very solid upgrades up into the 50's. Then maybe you you can start saving for cultural stuff. Once you hit the 50's, the nicer ldon drops will start being usable too with their 46, 55, 60 recommended levels.<br />
<br />
Your weapons look ok, at a couple levels past yours I think I was really proud of my newly acquired lamentation + centi shortsword combo, for reference. I ended up with full crusty armor around there somewhere too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ikkies can wear ry'gorr and crustacean stuff right? those alone will fill in a lot of slots with decent upgrades and some stat boosting.<br />
if not; doing a search in the bazaar for Gothic Armor can grab ya some cheapo upgrades which is comparable ( as a reference ) to what i wore into my 50's ) crafted armor.<br />
<br />
weapon-wise, for a casual player you're doing well. try to make a habit of checking in on the bazaar on your server and look for some new weapons with max what you want to spend. usually you can find people dumping decent weapons cheap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A few months ago a friend and I were leveling our necro/beastlord combo in the EW and it was so dead.  The only people that were there were 65's starting the Coldain ring quest and some people traveling from Kael and back.  Although Thurg armor would be some really solid upgrades for you, I would at least try to duo some giants with a sham/druid/cleric to at least start getting some factioning done and over with..... because at one point or another I think you will want to start playing in ToV with a guild and you will need positive faction anyhow.<br />
<br />
About a year and a half ago I was where you are, and it can be frustrating. Take pleasure in the small victories as much as the large ones.  Take your time getting to 65/70, it's not as incredible as you may think.  Good Luck and you can always send me a cross-server tell if you have any questions!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iksargo</div><div class="date">10-26-2004, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, i haven't been able to get on the comp for while, so thanks for all of the sugestions! A friend might give me 10k plat to help me out, so now i'd like to know what i should spend the 10k on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spockmaster</div><div class="date">10-26-2004, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">your magelo link is broken, i cant see your gear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iksargo</div><div class="date">10-26-2004, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">dunno what happened, pretty sure it was working earlier...can't get on magelo right now to fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirphoenix_18</div><div class="date">10-26-2004, 07:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just as a small addition to my other post........ worry less about gear and more about levels until about 50.  At that time go for the droga pair and some other random pieces to make you a better tank.<br />
<br />
Keep the 10k you have now in the bank and keep on leveling..... along the way from 40-50 don't be surprised if you see that amount double, especially if you do a lot of LDoN's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warhead42</div><div class="date">10-26-2004, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep the 10k you have now in the bank and keep on leveling.....<br />
Agreed.  On my server, prices are crashing almost on a daily basis.  What were once 7-8k weapons each just a month ago (Copper Hammer of Striking / Sword of the Bloodsworn) are now 5k each and falling.<br />
<br />
If it takes you a few days or a couple of weeks to get to level 50, don't worry about it.  Once you reach level 50, pick up the droga pair and use whatever's left to upgrade your AC, HP and stamina.<br />
<br />
But in the mean time, like everyone said, have fun! =)  That is what the game is all about, isn't it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dacke</div><div class="date">10-27-2004, 01:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did see the copper hammer for 4500 the other day on AB, picked up a widebladed 2hs sword for 1100, no lifetap proc but okey dmg and better delay then sword of the crypt keeper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">10-27-2004, 07:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If i were level 37 and came into 10K I'd hold onto it. Right now, worn haste at 31 or 36% is the single most expensive &quot;must have&quot; item for warriors in their late 40s/50s. And haste is falling in price a bit, I think. I'd start tracking it on your server, but my hunch is that more and more 65+ warriors are either tributing their haste or getting it through augs. that leaves a lot of CoFs and soulsccreams and  runed bolster belts and seahorse belts out there (well, not a lot, but more than there used to be with respect to the number of players who can use them).</div></div><hr />
