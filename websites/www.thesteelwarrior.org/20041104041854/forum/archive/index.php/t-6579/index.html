<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Athrias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This won't matter for awhile, as I am not high enough lvl, but I want to get it outta the way now. If I were to Anger3 a SBoD and a BoC, mainhand the BoC (duh), would that really be *that* much less aggro than an Anger3'd Copper Hammer or Sword of the Bloodsworn? I'll use them if it will make a huge difference for my guild and my groups, but if it's an almost negligible difference I would much rather get away from the cookie-cutter look. I mean, it's nice to think that you have a neat character as well, right? <br />
<br />
Price doesn't matter, I can get an SBoD free without too many issues. Thanks  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you're that intent on not using a Droga weapon, then just use the SBoD as-is in the offhand.  Don't waste valuable LDON points on it.<br />
 <br />
I would rather see you spend your LDON points on building a spiffy-looking Malevolent Dirk of Deception from Miragul camp, and augment THAT, rather than augment a truly shitty weapon.<br />
 <br />
Probably 3/4 of your aggro comes from the mainhand, so your BOC will still result in decent aggro.<br />
 <br />
Just be aware that you are limiting your entire group's overall DPS by choosing the lower aggro of the SBoD.  This means longer missions, slower XP, more attrition on raids, etc. all for the sake of your vanity.  The difference WILL be noticeable to any DPS class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">BoC + SBoD <br />
<br />
will be less aggro than <br />
<br />
BoC + either droga weapon<br />
<br />
no matter what procs you have on them<br />
<br />
<br />
assuming your anger3'd both the BoC and whaterver you decided to offhand, your aggro would be very strong due to an anger3 BoC in mainhand.<br />
<br />
in offhand SBoD puts out more dps, but you lose ~ 500hate from the innate proc on either droga weapon.<br />
<br />
assuming 305 dex and no WA,<br />
<br />
BoC w/A3 and SBoD w/ A3 = 3200 hate per min<br />
BoC w/A3 and unaugmented droga wep = 3100 hate per min <br />
BoC w/A3 and droga wep w/ A3= 3700 hate per min <br />
<br />
like i said, with an A3 BoC mainhanded you shouldnt have any troubles at all with aggro unless youre grouping with characters that are elemental (wizards).  anything else is just icing on the cake, and warriors can never get too much of that. in the end you would only miss out on 1 proc per minute ... but that 1 proc may make the difference in the long run .... /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you could always build a 17/20 1hb from ldon .... or a 16/19 as the poster above stated.<br />
<br />
or ... if you wanted a really cool graphic blade get the ldon yak blade ... the graphic is the same as a BF i believe ... looks amazing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Athrias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Kinda annoying that weapon choices are basically limited to anything that has an innate proc with a decent amount of aggro. Guess I'll just whip out a good 'ole Copper Hammer. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Personally, I think it is a waste to aug anything agro wise if it doesn't already have an innate proc.</div></div><hr />

Pff, you should have seen the class a year ago.  Be thankful that warriors can do their fucking job today, because a year ago, you had 2 weapon choices...jack and crap.</div></div><hr />

I remember jack and crap well.  All jack had going for it was it's delay, and crap was just... shitty.<br />
<br />
Sorry, lame joke.</div></div><hr />

Sir that is the curse smelted blade you mentioned in the sentence above.<br />
16/19 when mod'd.  I truly wish i had done this rather than the 17/20 club just because of the graphic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">in my experiances with an unaugmented bloodfrenzy (i'm lazy), it really doesnt matter what i'm holding in my offhand. SBoD is a decent offhand weapon until you get something better. personally, i wouldnt put angar3 on any weapon that wasnt temperary or at least going to last a very long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&quot;Sir that is the curse smelted blade you mentioned in the sentence above.<br />

<br />
the 16/19 i initially spoke of wasnt the cursed smelt, it was the malevolant dirk from everfrost, which also happens to 16/19 with the righ augs  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ahh I another mis-communication heh  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The malevolent dirk also happens to look terrific, and this thread is about looks over function, after all. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">cursed smelt looks way cooler than malevolant  ... nothing pwns like a BF graphic</div></div><hr />

<br />
but the dirk has no proc ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Indeed, but a MDoD with anger 3 is better aggro than a SBoD with anger 3.</div></div><hr />
