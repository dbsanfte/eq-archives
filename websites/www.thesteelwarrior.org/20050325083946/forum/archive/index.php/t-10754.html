<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garthud</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the groups I hunt with often has a 2nd warrior, and we've had quite a bit of success, as you have some nice options.  I thought I'd share a good example and a senario for Kyv Heartstriker Jhiru that we've had good luck with.  We've now finished all 1-6 GoD trials with 2 warriors in the group, and no enchanter.<br />
<br />
Warrior A - say this is your stronger warrior, although this works if both are about the same<br />
Warrior B<br />
<br />
<br />
Warrior A pulls Kyv Heartstriker Jhiru  with an arrow.<br />
Warrior B uses a pumace stone while Kyv Heartstriker Jhiru is running in to both debuff him and set rampage.<br />
Warrior A starts on him, and after takes some damage, kicks on Reposte.  By the time it runs out, Warrior A has been healed back to full.<br />
Warrior B sees A starting to take damage again, then AOE taunts, and after taking a hit or two, Repostes as well, and get's healed back up as well.<br />
Warrior A now sees B taking some damage and AOE taunts it back, and tanks it on to the end.<br />
At this point Warrior B has the choice of going Stonewall which will basicly 'push' agro to your stronger warrior, in addition to cutting in half the rampage damage, or, if it's going well, kick in another offensive disp.<br />
<br />
This also gives your slower almost 30 seconds to get him slowed (which by now Jhiru is down to between 25 and 50 health left), while noone is at too much risk of taking damage, and with all the reposting, should not have a chance at taking agro either.<br />
<br />
Also, since we both have our epic 1.5's we get the bonus 600 hps up for the whole fight.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, just thought I'd pass this on.... no charmed pet requred at all   :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ranger pulls with WS pet beats the poop out of named.  If WS drops before named is dead, Warrior Furious/AEtaunt.  By that time, pet has killed named.<br />
<br />
Done it this way before they nerfed the zone.  Pooka pet's were of course overpowered.  Seen one eat the named about 10secs through the rangers WS.  It wasn't right..lol.<br />
<br />
**Noc's are cool to, just a lil bit crazy to control if they break** Usually have a paladin in the group chain stunning pet if it does break.<br />
<br />
Since they raised level of mobs you may have to kill a high level pooka till it spawns as the level 64 pooka ya need.  <br />
<br />
Happy Hunting  :P</div></div><hr />

PE+PL is enough to keep almost any tank up vs jhiru, especially once he's slowed.</div></div><hr />

Keep em under 10-15% health and snared.  If charm breaks, he's running (or trying since he's snared) and stays in place.  Just make sure you tank with the pet on the back side of the mob.<br />
<br />
When you get to the Kyv, CH the pet and let him roll.</div></div><hr />

/shrug.  Done it both ways.  Was easier to grab a pooka and go.</div></div><hr />

We got a enc/war/mage/cle/dru/sham and just cleaned the zone out. Last mob I pulled jhiru poped furious and pet engaged named was dead in roughly 15 sec. We used Hynid since when we zoned in he was staring at us saying plz charm me.<br />
<br />
Hynid/pooka/cragbeast don't summon rest do as I recall so using one of those is the best for the chanter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
cleric druid warrior  necro  (asorted slower(prefeer bard but lets face it they  dont grow on trees)) (insert any class here)<br />
<br />
necro pulls unless we have  one of our  guild bards thn they  pull<br />
<br />
when we come to jiru  he gets  debuffed an dcrap by necro  or bard <br />
<br />
bard fades  i pull  necro pet in  (buffed whit his  hit runes of  like  4   fully  absorbed hits) or necro pulls and  i grab aggro necro pet in necro  fds to tansfeer  ramp t pet<br />
<br />
ripo disc  ..   then hit  fewllstrike  .. fight lasts less then  30  seconds (dependsing on classes we have we walk over brghe  and grabs next new meber that needs flagg... grabbing charmed dps in tipt nowadays is a waste oif  time and place they  dont hit for as much charmed but still hits hard   for  the  robes... but if   i whould  considder charming  one i allways liked  the cragbeast  the best  whit pet toys and full haste they just so  cute</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stephen51</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We tend to do this without a warrior (sorry Pally here again), and use the pet  and Ranger method. However in recent weeks our Beastlord has been able to tank the boss with his version of defensive. I wonder then has the boss been nerfed not to bypass warrior defensive now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cily</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">grabbing charmed dps in tipt nowadays is a waste oif time and place they dont hit for as much charmed but still hits hard for the robes<br />
<br />
Um, huh?<br />
<br />
Charmed mobs in Tipt hit just as hard charmed as not charmed.<br />
<br />
Cragbeast last time through was hitting for 1048 and doing about 1700 DPS. This was less than a month ago.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garthud</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sure there are many different ways to tackle this guy, I just wanted to pass on that even with the warrior being nerfed in this trial (and yes it still is, as of 2 days ago), that fellow warriors would like to know that it can be beaten reasonably easily with 2 warriors working as a team, and with very little risk of problems with a pet.  You can even use the defensive nerf to your advantage as explained above and push agro to the other warrior.<br />
<br />
One thing we've not tried yet, but I suspect will work, will be 2 warriors both defensive.  I'm thinking that he would just ping between us, as we both are at the top of the hate list, then kicked back down once a tick by his 'deffensive nerf', going to the other warrior.  The reason I think this would work is that when I've had defensive up on him, he says his &quot;I'll not fool with you emote&quot;, but then with an anger proc here and there, he'll turn back to me, for a few moments, then back to the other warrior.... so the nerf does not stay up 100% of the time while you are defensive... more like once a tick, you do a no fail &quot;Un-Taunt&quot;, that the next proc could grab him back with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">don't you think the risk of Jhiru beating on the third on hate list is high enough to avoid such ping-pong, without even thinking at the hard work the healer will have to switch back and forth between the two warriors in coordination with Jhiru... :confused: this poor cleric will miss some gems :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
go up to mob.  attack.  don't use defensive.  voila... mob dead.<br />
<br />
for god's sake i once killed this mob with just myself, a cleric, and a shaman -- and that was at level 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garthud</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course it's easy with advanced toons, as you can just plow through it, but some people may like ideas on beating some critters with pre-elemetal level characters as well.</div></div><hr />

Group was runnign somewhere around 1200 dps total.  Weaponshield then aetaunt fortitude ... disc falls at 20% his life and zero problems finishing him off.<br />

Debuffed but no slow and still cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yella</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was pretty standard tactics back in the day before GoD was nerfed to use a monk/rogue to pull and riposte (or a WS ranger), then taunt off with a riposting warrior. By the time that was all done, he would be allmost dead, particularly with a charmed pooka available (I seem to remember that some fights were conducted with tanks recieving zero damage). You can do interesting things by chaining invul type discs ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
why u seing fort use furi and hell be dead by the time furi is down if u have ranger ws tank him at first<br />
<br />
<br />
and for the record charmed dps is tipt  dosent hit had as the normal un charmed does  they  spike for normaml but over all  they  dont lash out  the sane dps as they did<br />
<br />
unless they  changed it back recently</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">curtdwar</div><div class="date">03-05-2005, 02:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We tend to do the same as Repthor. Many wins now, works well.<br />
<br />
For those without the mana pools, or the AC/HP tanks to feel confident, bring a mage with the 66 air pet.  Furious on inc. Once furious is down the air pet will have built a fair bit of agro. You can now safely hit defensive. Jhiru will turn from you to next on hate list, that's the pet. Pet rules apply and he cannot tank while you are standing there. Agro is all yours.<br />
<br />
I have done this several times when taking underpowered groups through. (mainly groups without PE, PL).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lauralei</div><div class="date">03-15-2005, 06:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ranger, Cleric, Enchanter, Paladin, Rogue, Warrior - no charmed pet and all of us were 65 with no EP or even VT gear.  Ranger pulls with annul magic, then pops WS and chains TW.  Rogue can go full offensive from the start.  Warrior AE taunts when the rangers WS is about to drop.   Ranger can then pop TS and the fight is over.  <br />
<br />
If you know what you are doing you don't need the pet (although it does speed things up, especially with pre-elemental dps).  <br />
<br />
I always liked the Paladin for the extra rezzer and the back up healing/tanking.</div></div><hr />

Rogue pulls~ and uses Counterattack (autoriposte) and when it drops, he /hides or whatever it is they do, then ranger jumps in and WS.  <br />
If mob isn't dead after WS, warrior AOE taunt, Bazu Bellow, Furious....goodbye?</div></div><hr />

The DPS pet is finally being Nerfed. I've never done it without a pet yet, so it should be quite a challenge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is how we did it, and at level 65 with no Time gear.   It was hard, we lost a lot, but it was doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">03-17-2005, 10:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i imagine its supposed to be hard. ive never done the tipt run but i have tanked vxed through with a cleric/druid on spams (buffed to about 10.5/1700), which im told is somewhat laughable for GoD progression... <br />
<br />
bottom line is good players can find a way to make it work, uber gear or not</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobsmash Emgood</div><div class="date">03-17-2005, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A solid trick to doign this is haveing a war chanter healer and rest being RANGED DPS, mabey a BL for back up slow.<br />
<br />
Have the war pull and use furious and then send in charmed pet right away. When furious is down use defensive though makeing sure pet has had a bit of melee on him with taunt on and NO ONE BUT THE WAR is in melee range.<br />
<br />
Normaly he will ignore a defensive warrior but the charmed pet will have agro enough to keep the mob on it and as long as there is a PC in melee range the mob will be on him not the pet even with the warrior being in defensive. <br />
<br />
If done right the pet will be ramp and he has a ton of hp so is rather easy to heal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I've tanked Vxed through at 9300/1750 with just my 2 boxed cleric for heals - it's a lot easier than it used to be for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tubthumpa</div><div class="date">03-21-2005, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've used defensive successfully twice now on groups that didn't have a chanter or ranger in them.<br />
<br />
You need to be fast, but furious on inc, tank him down and then as soon as furious drops hit defensive, AETaunt and bazu bellow in quick succession - I've never lost aggro yet using it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">03-21-2005, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've done tipt successfully with:<br />
<br />
group a:<br />
War, Bard, Clr, Pal, Nec, Shm<br />
Treated it like a dungeon crawl, one tank would step in for other if they died.  Worked fine, even if our cleric ended the fight oom.  I was about 9500hp/1650ac buffed at the time.<br />
<br />
group b:<br />
War, Bard, Clr, SK, Shm, Shm<br />
Again, dungeon crawl.  Even easier than group a, granted, I had gained 2 levels from previous attempt.  I was buffed up to 10.4k hp/1790ish ac for this group.  I brought out a shield and did furious, then just prayed the healers could keep me up after that disc faded.</div></div><hr />
