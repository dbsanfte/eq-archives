<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Trong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Leading a Hate raid on sunday and I have a few questions.<br />
<br />
1. Where does the Hand spawn at and can he be single pulled?<br />
<br />
2. Can my raiding party sit at the zone in like before and pull to there, or is it now a dungeon crawl type of raid?<br />
<br />
3. Can the Hand of Maestro drop off any other MOBS other than the Unpleasant Hand or Maestro?<br />
<br />
4. Whats the respawn time of The Unpleasant Hand?<br />
<br />
As you prolly tell I'm leading the raid to get my Hand of Maestro, one of two pieces left for my lightsabers. As of today I have enough ppl showing up to make 4 full groups. Is that going to be enough for The Unpleasant Hand?<br />
<br />
Any help on stratagy and zone info will be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tsaotsao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am told the Hand of the Maestro is a separate spawn now. I have been to the building where the Maestro spawns (in New Hate) but neither he nor the Hand was up. <br />
<br />
You don't need to kill the Maestro now for the Hand, and the Maestro is a much tougher mob.<br />
<br />
A lot has been posted already, so if you do a search, you may be able to get those answers.<br />
<br />
I didn't get the loc of the building, but it is a bigger one, kind of like a cathedral.<br />
<br />
Hate is one level now instead of two. You probably can't pull the mob to the zone in and I don't think you'd want to anyway. The zone in is not as insane as the old one was, but it isn't trivial either. Be ready to fight when you get there. The most we had on us was 4 mobs when we went in with 18 toons, average level 58 with at least 5 of those at 65 including a 65 pally, druid, ranger, and chanter. We didn't have any problems and at the end we were down to 8 toons average level 61 and we were alright, but it was getting a bit more exciting.<br />
<br />
But please take this in context.. I've been there once since the re-vamp. There was a group from a high tier guild in the zone who came in shortly after we did.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1. Where does the Hand spawn at and can he be single pulled?<br />
The hand is a completely seperate spawn from Maestro now. Maestro is a bad ass, you want to stay away from him unless the 4 groups are 65+aa and geared up pretty good. Most guilds take a full raid for him. The hand spawns near Maestro, I believe in the building next to the Cathedral that Maestro spawns in/<br />
<br />
2. Can my raiding party sit at the zone in like before and pull to there, or is it now a dungeon crawl type of raid?<br />
Not really. The respawn on mobs is much faster now, in the neightborhood of 12 minutes. The hand spawns far enough away that you will have a hard time clearing enough mobs to pull all the way back to the zone in. On the plus side, you don't have to worry about all the messed up agro from the old school Hate. Mob pathing and spawns are pretty good and makes crawling the zone a fun adventure instead of a cluster fuck.<br />
<br />
3. Can the Hand of Maestro drop off any other MOBS other than the Unpleasant Hand or Maestro?<br />
The epic drop is ONLY from the Unpleasant Hand now.<br />
<br />
4. Whats the respawn time of The Unpleasant Hand?<br />
I have not confirmed it myself, but I am pretty sure the hand is a 3 day spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In the middle of the zone, pretty much straight out from the zone in, you will run into a building that has steps leading up to it.  You can easily pull the mobs out onto those steps and fight there.  That is the building that both Maestro and the hand spawn in.  If you use Pacify, you can easily pull singles from that building, otherwise you will be getting pairs, but they are all mezzable.  <br />
<br />
Just inside the doors to the right will be two spawns.  One is a normal mob, the other is the hand.  If there is only one spawn up, then the hand has already been killed.  Just as an FYI, there are two mobs to the left, and two straight ahead that can all be pulled from that area without aggroing Maestro, and all are easily one groupable or less even.  Through that next set of doors and to the right is where Maestro will spawn, and I guess another named mob(named Assassin I think), but I have yet to see either up.<br />
<br />
I have seen the hand up quite often on Solusek Ro, and we are camping there, I just have the hand pacified before pulling that area so that it will still be up for someone that might actually need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kbam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The zone in for Hate is safe now.  The aggro range on all the mobs have been greatly reduced and single pulling is trivial for the most part.  It is still possible to aggro mobs through the walls however so make sure when moving people around to stay in the middle of the paths or near walls of buildings that you know you have cleared.<br />
<br />
The old world hate mobs populate the northern part of the zone and have the same abilities pre-revamp.  As you move farther south you will see the same models but with new names (cleric of hate --&gt; vicar of hate).  These are beefed up versions and do hit a bit harder and have more hitpoints.  Further south are DEs of the various classes and are a step up in difficulty in terms of damage and hit points but all can be mezzed.<br />
<br />
The Hand of the Maestro is the same model pre-revamp but has been significantly enlarged.  As started earlier in this thread, he is in the first part of the Maestro's castle, on the right just as you enter the door (head south over the bridge from zone-in and stay towards the middle, castle is hard to miss).  The Hand rampages, has a good number of hitpoints and is extremely MR but can be done easily by a group of 65s.  Only drops hand for epic but does drop it every time.  Not sure of respawn but seems to be up all the time since he doesn't drop any other loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vathoss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When my guild raids Hate, our first camp is usually the Maestro's steps. It is very safe there and the Hand spawns in the maestro's building(I don't know where, I don't pull) Our puller has gotten it single both times we've found him up. As for the forces required, we can do it with 3-4groups of 50-60ish, relying on BST slow... hes a pansy reallly.</div></div><hr />
