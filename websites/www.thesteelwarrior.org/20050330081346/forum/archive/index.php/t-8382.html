We just made it into Phase 4 of Time and I MT'd Saryn and Terris Thule.  I was wondering if these mobs have a lot of riposte or not so I know if I should just use 1 1hs and a shield.<br />
<br />
I really couldnt tell what they were doing since I was paying more attention to placement and the script.<br />

Thanks a ton.</div></div><hr />

did you used DW ? ~&gt;  since your magelo show neither 2Her neither shield, I would say yes then you don't have any pb of survability caused by riposts. So keep using your BoC+A3/EoE+A3 combo without fear.</div></div><hr />

At no point in my post was I freaking out or run around screaming OMG Rispostes!.  I asked a question is all because I didnt know first hand.<br />
<br />
We killed TT, but if me changing out to a 1hs and shield combo would make it easier on the healers thats what I would prefer to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry if I sounded like an ass but this question is coming every 2 days... and the answer has always been the same: riposte are not an issue in most encounters. The added dps/spikes wont ever be as bad as many people make them to be (fyi mob rispote rate got decreased during PoP, a while ago but people still think &quot;omg ripostes are awfull, I can see them killing me with my own eyes watching those numbers on my screen !!&quot;)<br />
<br />
We killed TT, but if me changing out to a 1hs and shield combo would make it easier on the healers thats what I would prefer to do.<br />
<br />
No, it won't make it easier for your healers for a simple reason: by tanking with a shield you're going to lose a shitload of aggro depending on how you do saryrn/TT it can be a real pain for your nukers, forcing them to gimp their dps to match your aggro making the fight longer, and those mobs have an AE mana drain that will actually make it harder for your healers.<br />
And this is true for any fight anyway, the longer the fight last, the most chance you have to die and that won't be because of a riposte.</div></div><hr />

Frod or any oldschool warriors that have been there and done that.  My guilds warriors have been given the impression that Xeg is undoable without a BoW because of riposte's and I'm basically wondering if that is true, or is that the general concensus, that Xegony is impossible without a BoW?</div></div><hr />

With Incite, Anger 3, and dual wielded hate weapons you should easily be pumping out as much or more hate than I did without a Blade of War.</div></div><hr />

Once he gets aggro established, your MT can easily shift to a shield in his offhand assuming his primary is a decent aggro weapon.  Whats challenging about Xegony is intercepting the adds before they get into aggro range of the MT's healers.  I still get twitchy thinking about the spiders coming over the top of that big rock...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iyacc@work</div><div class="date">08-05-2004, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Xegony's dps is very spiky. I tanked her again last night(using a BoW). For me I would go a couple of minutes and never go below 60% health (10.8k hp) and then all of a sudden have 30 seconds where each round I was dropping to 25%, yet the heal chain stayed smooth throughout. <br />
<br />
She would miss quite often and then all of a sudden double or triple for 2k+ each hit, several rounds in a row. <br />
<br />
I don't know how much she ripostes, so I can't offer if it's a huge concern or not using DW versus 2H. I don't keep log running, so don't really have any way to check.<br />
<br />
<br />
Off topic of riposte but related to xegony fight...<br />
<br />
I do know that keeping my AC over 2k seemed to make a big difference compared to previous runs where her dps seemed higher when I would float around 1900 AC. Not sure if this was all in my head, or not. <br />
<br />
<br />
Fennin seems to have a much smoother dps and doesn't spike as much.</div></div><hr />

He tanked fennin night before last with BF and a lodizal shell shield I think and made it look pretty easy (hats off to our healers that night).There is no mob anywhere in EQ that requires 2h to tank. It's been parsed time and again, riposte damage is not nearly as much as some people make it out to be. You have a better chance of being one rounded by a quad hit that lands for full damage 4x than you do of being one rounded by a quad hit that lands for full 3x+ a riposte. Riposte rate is generally smaller than max hit rate on mobs that you don't have significantly high AC than is required to tank the mob.<br />
<br />
Incidently, Xegony is one of the text book fights where using a shield is a good idea. Since most of your damage people take breaks to kill the adds, you can easily build up enough agro to go 1h+shield with little or no danger of losing agro. If your tanks are really worried about it, swap in a shield after the first set of adds are dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kleth</div><div class="date">08-07-2004, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rallos Zek and Quarm are the only 2 time encounters where a shield may be worth it (Even then I'd switch at about 70-80%). The rest are not really due to agro reductions, slows, fears or any other effect that may cause people to have to control their dps. <br />
<br />
If it is your first few times through Time, TZ,VZ, Rallos,Quarm and maybe Bertox, have chances to round a tank regardless of what you have equipped, so go for more agro and dps them dead faster.<br />
<br />
On the Xegony thing, didn't someone find once your 2100ac + her dps is dramatically reduced? I forget. Anyway, no you don't need a BoW to tank her, just a solid chain and some DI if your really worried.</div></div><hr />

RZ is pretty hardcore, but not really. I find the lesser Zek bros to be more dangerous than RZ really. Regardless I pretty much always switch to shield when def drops unless I dont feel I have solid aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">08-08-2004, 01:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well about xegony spikes= flurry(bugged ramp message) + low min/high max fennin highmin/relative low max and yeah really after debuffs are in you can swap in a shield.  I usually tank her with BF + that shield from fire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ayida</div><div class="date">08-08-2004, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">and BoW isn't the only 2handed weapon out there, even IF you *needed* to do her with 2h instead of dual.   It's not like you a choice of BoW or dual wield. <br />
<br />
With an Anger III aug (and as long as your fellow tankers aren't using BoW or highly aggroed dual wields), you can easily tank someone like Xegony with a SEWS or an Emp's sword, or a list of other weapons. <br />
<br />
Optimal just isn't the same thing as preferable, or even possible, and if you're willing to try, you can often get away with a lot.  I realize that most of the time here we're talking about min/maxing the situation for optimal results, and that's good, so you know what would be &quot;nice&quot;.<br />
<br />
But all those buffs, and half that equipment are just as often icing on the cake.  You can muddle through without them, as happened to me the other day in a hard ldon when we were running out of time, I died, and had to be rezzed in and fight without buffage.</div></div><hr />

We finally got 1 BoW(yay us), unfortunatly I didnt have enough dkp to win it :(<br />
So for my own thought should I continue to try RZ raids for more BoW drops or just wait until we hit time and aim for DBoW/EoE or VDD augd?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jobned</div><div class="date">08-08-2004, 09:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am warrior classleader in my guild and assign tankorders. When we raid PoTime, My biggest problem is ppl who ¨think one thing or the other and go out of the way to test it. <br />
<br />
Lets start from the beginning. I want the best base agro possible for my tanks without exeption. Agro is the most important factor because very very obviously if we can maintain a steady high agro it will mean that our DPS classes can trust the mobs to be proberbly engaged and go for as much damage as possible instead of holding back in fear of death.<br />
<br />
the way to get a high agro engage starts with the rangers. I dont know what on earth they are posting on the ranger boards but per default it seem that they are taught to go WS; jolt, jolt, jolt jolt; jolt. This was one of our base problems when we hit time. We want the rangers to go full agro and never hit jolt. It is ok if they go full agro untill  3/4 into their weapon shield and then do nothing, jolt is banned.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the MA, SA, THIRD A has to trust the rangers on agrobuild. There is a chance of an out of range AE taunt in potime. This means that if the warrior happens to be out of range when the ranger dies he still have to be way on top of the Agro list. This means that he has to start build agro rather early. He is not suposed to do anything else but put attack on early in the fight, no taunting allowed, however 3/4 into the fight when the ranger stops casting he has to move to the centre of the mob, hit furious then ae taunt.<br />
<br />
thirdly furiuos. In potime there is no exuse for a warrior to not to furiuos on agro take over. There is no mobs who will flurry own you. Furious will make you totally own agro, even if both the WS ranger fucked up and you fucked up on ae taunting furuios will still be descent base agro to launch the guild overall DPS. anyways with a prober ranger weapon shield and a prober furious engage it will be very hard for anyone in your guild to outagro you unless. <br />
<br />
You are afraid  to die because of riposte and equip a shield. In case you do that you will eventually in the fight lose agro, your casters will stop trusting you, guild dps will lower etc.<br />
<br />
Also with this kind of engage your secondary tanks. SA, Third A etc will be able to position themself as Second and third on the agro list. When i SA in my guild i put attack on maybe 15 seconds into the weapon shield knowing that the MA allready had attack on for 8 second or so and have big base agro, THe Third A will put attack on maybe arround assist call and everyone will make educated guesses on their procs. meaning if the sa or third a has a lot of close together procs he takes attack off for a few to moderate for hes increased agro.<br />
<br />
my last points is that it dosnt matter if you get one rounded. The cleris are suposed to be trying to heal you between each mob attack round. They will not allways suceed, however if you die there will allways be another warrior standing next in line to pick up on you, unless you are the only warrior wich is very unlikely for a potime guild. So allways go for maximising agro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People still use void tanks? Man, we haven't done that since Vex Thal. Oh, except Reparm I think. And even that was only once or twice.<br />
<br />
Also, there is reason not so use furious on a tank switch: on a boss where it isn't warranted. I save it for high dps mobs, like Rallos, on a change. If I was going in on say, Saryrn, why bother. The secondary healers/paladins can keep me up for the 10 seconds it takes the chain to get on me.</div></div><hr />

I've tanked Xegony every time we've fought her, and with a bard standing next to me, I'm hovering around 2300ac depending on how lazy the bard wants to be (they tend to get lax after a while on a Xegony fight). <br />
<br />
Xegony's dps really isn't any higher than your average Fire or Water mini, but it's tremendously spikey with the bugged Flurry and her insanely low ass ATK.  She also hits really fast, even slowed.<br />
<br />
This is a picture from my hitbox while tanking Xegony:<br />
<br />
http://www.venerationx.com/img/raidImg/gogoAc.jpg<br />
<br />
I parse her in between at ~725dps range with 2200+ AC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i think it would help the most just to post how much dmg she does a round, avg doesnt mean anything.<br />
<br />
something like <br />
<br />
6.5k <br />
7.3k<br />
8.7k<br />
9.1k - flurry round<br />
6.2k<br />
5.7<br />
11k - flurry round(use to kill me, hah)<br />
<br />
having someone spellshield too will save an extra 1k in hp when not in disc, really helps.<br />
<br />
i dont know why you would need a BoW necessarily on xegony, you are only fighting for agro over the CH clerics. 1h + shield is more ac and hp than BoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to completely disagree with you, as I know where you're coming from, but don't most all elemental boss/minis already have the capabilities of one-rounding (or near one-rounding) you anyways?  Blazzax can put almost ~14k in a single round of damage, Reparm about ~25k, Hydrotha 12k, Enlightened ~12k, and Xegony ~15k almost.  That's way more than any tank is going to have at this point in the game, even with GoD AAs and augs out the wazoo.  Mind you, not *all* minis are like that.  Fennin Ro can technically only put ~8k to the table in a single round of combat, air Avatars ~8-9k also, earth minis ~8-9k, hell even Warlord Gintolaken ~9k, hehe.<br />
<br />
Average dps, for the most part, still shows you pretty much what you're looking at.  Now, this is where I agree with you here.  Hydrotha and Xegony do roughly the same amount of dps, but why is Hydrotha fully healable with a 5 cleric, 3 second rotation, but Xegony pretty much requires an 8 cleric, 2 second rotation (for both duration and speed)?  That's a shitload difference in healing power if you ask me (And yes, I've both tanked and ROTTED on a Xegony fight at the same time).  <br />
<br />
If you're looking at average damage-per-round that Xegony gives out, well, you're looking at ~54% of all her hits being minimum and ~0.4% of her hits being maximum @ ~2300ac and her being debuffed out the wazoo.  EQCompanion actually parses swing percentages (how many are singles, doubles, triples, quads, quad+), but unfortunately my logs are all on my two raid drives (Just upgraded to a new Athlon64 and I have to get the data backed up using my old RAID controller, which my friend now has), and being an officer, everything I've ever tanked (and whatever goes through my chat screen) has been logged since about February 2004.<br />
<br />
It would be rather interesting to calculate what the average damage per swing each mob in the elemental planes actually dishes out.  Being that Xegony is such a fast hitting, spikey son of a bitch though, I actually don't see her average damage-per-round really being all that high.  It's just that *one* unlucky round for the duration of her 45 minute life that really fucks everything over, hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So true.<br />
<br />
btw, we ended zerging her down from 29% or something when i died, had like 10 people standing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it would be good to know so someone can compare their ac and hp to yours and see if they would have lived through the fight.  if she spiked twice over 10k and you are only a 9.5k hp tank, that tells you alot more than the avg dps does... if you are 11k tank then you win, otherwise you lose... big difference.  it is also useful to see the effects of riposte. riposte + flurry out of disc is usually a killah. i tried spam healing with a bot cleric when out of disc, cant hurt, one of the best times for a bot machine as you can easily tank and bot a healer to cure and spam heal yourself.<br />
<br />
Average dps, for the most part, still shows you pretty much what you're looking at.  Now, this is where I agree with you here.  Hydrotha and Xegony do roughly the same amount of dps, but why is Hydrotha fully healable with a 5 cleric, 3 second rotation, but Xegony pretty much requires an 8 cleric, 2 second rotation (for both duration and speed)? <br />
<br />
8-9 clerics is optimal healing if u do a ch rotation. with 8 clerics, you pretty much chain CH with maybe an instant before u can recast your CH. adding more than 9 clerics does nothing but give you more med time. 8 is better, but with lag it sometimes takes 9. it is NOT a 2 second rotation, you are chain ching, it is only 2 second rotation in the logs because of latency. in disc you might do a 2 sec delay but out of disc your clerics better be chain ching.  obviously there is more to the dps of xegony than hydrotha, dunno exactly how you are mistaken, but 5 clerics will not keep up someone on xegony. often it is the 1k ae dd that xegony has that does you in, so it is good idea to spellshield when out of disc. perhaps you are killing hydrotha before your disc is out, 5 clerics could keep someone up on xegony while in disc.<br />
<br />
  It's just that *one* unlucky round for the duration of her 45 minute life that really fucks everything over, hehe.<br />
<br />
yes, this is why the only information i would care about is dmg per round, the avg dmg is meaningless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lots of parses, perhaps?  If you tanked Hydrotha for 45+ minutes like you do Xegony, in and out of disc regularly, you would probably find the dps of both mobs (Hydrotha and Xegony) to be about the same.  But you don't tank Hydrotha for 45+ minutes.  You generally tank him for about 3, and all of it in Defensive.<br />
<br />
I'm still sticking by the average damage-per-round of Xegony being, on average, somewhat lower than you think.  Her potential damage-per-round, however, combined with the fact that you're not always in disc, is another story.<br />
<br />
We use an 8 cleric, 2 second, steady rotation on Xegony.  Not just from the logs, but because I'm also in the rotation...</div></div><hr />
