<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Crimson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok Ive made the suggestion that, hello Im taking the speedbump route between a warrior, and a ranger, which isnt correct.  If you feel that it is, then Im sorry Ill go back to my server boards and never post here again because thats simply a moronic line of thinking about tanking.  Spells arent going to fix the gap, spells dont scale.  At this point, Im happy with a 24 second copy of weaponshield that works from all angles (to help with pulling) with perhaps a slightly lower refresh and working towards the progression of my class through spells, if you cant agree thats nessicary then your just unreasonable and the continued conversation between the classes is pointless.<br />
<br />
I havent gotten a really good view of what warriors want to do with the desireablity issue between paladins and shadowknights.  Even if paladins got a debuff icon added to any stun line, thats not going to narrow the tanking advantage by anything other than a slim margin.  Personally I dont want a stun, its a copy workaround and we have all seen that stuns cause more problems.  Way back when someone talked about a short duration cripple with a recourse to group, perhaps in the ballpark of a 30 second duration 80 second refresh, Im terrible with numbers so I wont go into that.  Only problem that I can forsee is that it will need to stack as the recourse to group will be a major desired part of the spell to allow sk's to stack on raids.<br />
<br />
The modified weaponshield would help with pulling, as would a faster casting FD and the addition of stonewall (monk) to the sk aa arsenal.<br />
<br />
Alot of knights want to see their debuffs do more for their group, imagine if we got a short duration hp/ac buff recourse, say in the area of adding 200 - 400 hp and 200 - 400 ac when cast to every member of the group for x amount of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A lot of the resident warrriors here agree that sk's have a shitty state atm and need some serious perks.  I personally wouldnt mind them getting:<br />
<br />
1. a riposte disc in line with WS (both knights would get this)<br />
2. .01 sec casting fd (instant with same recast time)<br />
3. Larger lifetaps with quicker casting<br />
4. Larger spears for more dps<br />
5. A debuff spell of their own which stacks with other classes.<br />
6. A longer lasting snare free from a dot component??<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladins really do have the best end of the deal atm.  The 3 tanking classes are about as balanced as i'd wager they will ever be, but sk's get the short straw that is for sure.<br />
<br />
ps- stonewall is the warrior disc which is basically defensive + snared tank .... in effect you want to replace us if youre really asking for this one.  You'll never get it, sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sks could just a lifetap damage shield or agro DS, maybe it only changed current castable DS to the agro or lifetap effect, but hey it's something.<br />
<br />
Or maybe a stun DOT? You could cast in on casters and it could stun every tick with a short duration stun. Or maybe a stun component to the DS.<br />
<br />
Really guys, I don't know I've never played a SK. The only real experience I have is from our guildleader that has an SK that my druid groups with quite frequently.<br />
<br />
Something tells my that you guys al lagging behind Pallies in group desirability, but I can't put my finger on. Until then, I'm quite clueless as to what exactly as SKs having a problem with.<br />
<br />
(I don't think nerfing Paladin stuns is a solution. In fact, I think too many mobs are immune/resistant to stuns as it is.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">SKs, it seems to me, have a potential set of problems that mostly stem from poorly tuned scalability in their spell books rather than lack of /disc defensive. But again, such circumstances have to be precisely defined if a sufficient solution set is going to be found.<br />
<br />
There is a reasonably precise statement of the problem and an indication of a proper direction for resolution.  Yet, whenever Warriors say, if your problems stem from your spellbook, then the proper correction lies in the spellbook, Shadow Knights have a cow and call us power mongering raid tank whores and such.  Or at least some Shadow Knights do anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bemyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I sorta agree with BB but not completly.  I see lots of utility for both sk and paladins on raids.  Shadow Knights are a huge part of our pull team and Paladins are huge assets in healing an curing.  As a paladin my utility is enhanced by mobs that have 4.5k ae and my fast heals are more usefull as mobs become expecially sensitive to low health agro.  Both Knight classes are required for assisting the crowd control people and keeping adds off healers and robe wearers.  And to be honest we have to off tank some because there are too many unmessable mobs in some events.  That being said I think the issue of warrior usefullness on a raid has gone way up.  Alot of stuff needs to be offtanked by a warrior.  And I  am not talking about just the big named guys.  Plus I would say that alot of unmessable stuff is better off tanked by warriors then knights now.  As long as a warrior can do damage on a mob they get agro nearly as fast and hold it much better then knights.  With HoTT it is easy to see who has agro and the only ones that steal agro from our warrior MT is other warriors.  Honestly I think raid content in GoD is well thought out and pretty balanced.  If anything I wish we had more warriors on raids.<br />
<br />
Where I see a much bigger issue is things like exp named mobs in Kod Taz and Yxatta.  Personally I can tank them pretty well now with a cleric and a back up healer.  My gear is pretty good I run about 11.3k hp and 2350 ac.  My issue isnt that warriors can tank the named better as much as rangers and rogues being a better choice to tank them.  Agian I see this as a content issue not a class balance issue.  It can be argued that Knights and Paladin in my case can tank non named exp mobs fine in Kod Taz fine.  But for me that evades the point.  If all I am after is exp then I can tank red mobs all day long with a much weaker group in Plane of Fire for better exp.  The thrill of hunting in GoD zones are those nice single group augs like 20 ac or the all elusive 50 hp mana end aug.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">exp named mobs in Kod Taz <br />
Named in open zones are &quot;fair game&quot;. Warriors do have an easier time with hard hitting unstunable cutting edge mobs, this includes some of these open zoned named mobs. This Warrior advantage gives some groups a motivation to group a Wariror instead of a Knight.<br />
<br />
However, Knights have their advantages too. One of the most shocking examples I saw was my son's SK using CoS to walk right by mobs we were otherwise going to have to kill, aggro the named, and bring him back to us solo.<br />
<br />
Despite the fact that Warriors have an advantage vs. open zone mini-named, nothing prevents a group from logging in a bot or having a guildmate run over to lend a hand. As the expansion becomes a little more tirivized by gear such measures won't be necessary and the Warrior cutting edge advantages vs. those particular mobs will disappear. It really doesn't take long in most cases. I enjoyed maybe a month where I got a stream of requests to do Fungi until I saw Knights on my server doing it with no problem.<br />
<br />
Sure, I moved on to mobs that were more cutting edge. Thank goodness they exist. When all three tanks can do content exactly as well, then there is no particular reason to group a Warrior - my best buff is pretty bad and I pull worse than a Drunk Monk.<br />

If you see an unreasonable suggestion about weaponshield (the context surrounding Crimson's &quot;unreasonable&quot; quote) then explain <br />

C. Suggest modifications or a different solution that would address the problem's characteristics in a way that is not overpowered.<br />
<br />
Remember, people on this board called Crimson a twat a few posts ago. <br />
Somebody calls me a twat and, as we used to say where I grew up, I'm absofuckinlutely gonna get unreasonable. <br />
<br />
In fact, and not surprisingly, Crimson's mental stability or lack thereof is of no concern to warriors as a class.<br />
<br />
SK functionality with respect to tanking and, in this case, SK's relationship to rangers in terms of being an emergency tank, might be a concern to warriors. Certainly it might be a concern to SKs. Do warriors have something intelligent to say about that?<br />
<br />
And Crimson, is there a means by which spell book design (as opposed to individual spells) might be reasonably make to scale? Or is /disc of some type the only way to scale an ability/resource for SKs to solve this problem in a way that is effective but not overpowered?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">On Lucy weapon shield lasts 4 ticks and has a recast of 4050.  This is not something a ranger pulls out on every single mob.  This is not something a ranger is using to tank his way to boss mobs at the end of trials.  This is, maybe, something a ranger is using once someone else, be it a pet, a warrior, a paladin, or a shadow knight has tanked the group to the boss mob.  And then the ranger may be using it as method to partially tank a boss that would otherwise eat the tank's lunch.<br />
<br />
Now, if Shadow Knights see this as a major sticking point for their class, okay.  I don't happen to see how players using a discipline in an unconventional fashion to accomplish something it really wasn't designed for as a major sticking point for Shadow Knights, but I'm willing to accept that they do.  <br />
<br />
However, you can not reasonably expect that people are going to see adding something identical to weapon shield to Shadow Knights but giving it a refresh period that is only a couple of minutes in length at most as being realistic and reasonable.<br />
<br />
Shadow Knights feel they should have a weapon shield to fall back on to allow them to tank something briefly that they would otherwise be unable to tank?  Fair enough.  Then it should have a duration of 12 seconds, like Warrior furious.  But, you argue, Shadow Knights don't tank as well as Warriors?  Okay, maybe the duration for Shadow Knights should be 14 or 16 seconds instead. What, that still isn't long enough?  Well, the 18 seconds for rangers seems excessive for a Shadow Knight, but maybe that might be negotiable.  What, 18 seconds STILL isn't long enough and you want 24 seconds?  Why?  Why on god's green earth do Shadow Knights rate a 24 second weapon shield like discipline when no other class in the game gets a version that lasts that long?<br />
<br />
Lets talk refresh timers.  Weapon Shield for rangers is a 4050 recast.  Furious for Warriors is a 2400 recast.  That's 68 minutes for Weapon Shield and 40 minutes for Furious.  Now, the proposal I've seen from Shadow Knights is that theirs refresh in something like 72 seconds.  I'm sorry, but that's insane.  I can see Shadow Knights getting an 18 second weapon shield like discipline that refreshed in 68 minutes like a ranger.  I can see Shadow Knights getting a 12 second furious like discipline that refreshed in 40 minutes like a Warrior.  I can't conceive of a justification for Shadow Knights to get a 24 second weapon shield like discipline that refreshes in 72 seconds or even 4 mintues.<br />
<br />
It's overpowered.  It could be used on every single mob or every other mob.  It would put most Warriors on the side lines, because having a 100% 24 second mitigation at the start of most every battle is far far better than a 45% 3 minutes mitigation for one battle every ten minutes or 100% mitigation for 12 seconds once every 40 minutes.  In fact if used correctly it could make defensive Warriors completely unneeded.<br />
<br />
Shadow Knights haven't shown the need for a weapon shield like discipline that completely blows all other similar disciplines out of the water.  They haven't shown the need to, rather than making the use of a discipline as a once in a while option, instead make it useable almost all the time. <br />
<br />
Frankly, since the retune of GoD, Shadow Knights haven't even really made a case that they &quot;need&quot; a weapon shield discipline at all.  All they've done is point to the fact that situationally sometimes a ranger can tank a hard hitting, but low HP, mob better than they can very very briefly.  Well, Shadow Knights can out tank Warriors on any mob that has a low damage output and on which life taps work.  Shadow Knights can out tank Warriors on any mob that fear and snare will work on.  There are a number of situations in the game where Warriors are out tanked by Shadow Knights.  And now there appears to be one where rangers out tank the Shadow Knights.  And as a consequence everything should be retuned around the Shadow Knight?  I don't think so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Stonewall is -also- the name of a monk Gates AA, that gives a percentage chance for spells that land on an FD monk to not break the feign. Cool yer jets.<br />
<br />
There's quite a large number of things that -could- be done to SKs, but it's very debateable as to what the -right- ones are. Complicating the issue are several wide factions of what we expect to get from our class. Personally, when I made my SK, I expected to be able to be able to go murderous soul eating rampages with sword in hand, but that hasn't exacly materialized. Many SKs expect, reasonably, to be fairly solid tanks. Others point to our spell lineup and expect to be damage machines. Still others expect to be pullers, a niche the SK had to hand carve out from under the monk. In a manner, we've become the monks of the hybrids, with little clear role and a highly fractured community. Worse, with our apparent primary role, tanking, being one that stacks poorly in much content, as well as having the recent issues of forced inferiority to a 'pure' class in closed content tuned to members of that pure class of a level above the current cap, combined with secondary roles that lack teeth compared to just about everyone else able to do them, it's a very angry community. <br />
<br />
I can't speak for Time+ SKs myself, however, there's a handful of things I see that could easily be done to put more effectiveness in our spellbook aside from /discs.<br />
<br />
1: Debuffs: Currently my best standalone Debuff, free of dots and recourses, is a level nine spell, Despair, which reduces target attack by 5. With a one minute DoT attack, I have a 40 str, 28 AC debuff. I have a 40 atk debuff with a group recourse attached. Yet my class description states I can slow and cripple my foes with dark magic - But all I can do meaningfully is snare. A real debuff, one that shaves off  5-10% of incoming damage, would go a long way towards establishing a reason to exist beyond tanking, for both raids and single groups. Combine this with the AA FD that they've betad in multiple expansions, and spell selection issues resolve themselves. This has the advantage of being something to do besides sit on our ass in a small group with a warrior, as well as stacking with another tank's mitigation abilities. The disadvantage is that you still really only need one or two SKs on a raid for this extra debuff. <br />
<br />
2: FD/Pulling fixes. Death Peace is a great spell, don't get me wrong. However, the pulling SK has fallen vastly behind his counterparts. While the combination of FD, snare, pets, and if you're lucky, the CoS(An item which hasn't dropped since velious), are useful, they pale in comparison to the power of instant FD + Phantom Wind, as well as the power of a skilled bard. SK FD is particularly fragile, vulnerable to stuns, casters, AEs, etc. Monk FD bypasses this first by being instant, and the later ones by way of AA - no such AA exists for SKs. In many places, these drawbacks can make us standbys. Granting the monk AA to FD through casting, and fixing the currently apparently broken Persistant casting AA would push many of these issues aside sufficently. <br />
<br />
3: Spell DPS: This should be a significant source of our damage output, and should probably be sustainable as 30% or so of our total damage. Yet the tools given to create this are significantly crippled. Our highest damage pure nuke parses out at an anemic 14.7 DPS if chain cast, while being disease based - A resist never debuffed by other players, except by shaman preparing a disease slow. Our top lifetap reaches 47 peak DPS, but is not in any way sustainable, costing nearly as much mana as Supernal Remedy or Cheal for a 470 point tap. For raw spell DPS, our best choice is a -Kunark- era lifetap. We are asked not to use our DoTs on raids, or our 160 per tick, 6 tick dot might block a necro's 300+ per tick dot. Other dots are even slower and lower damage. In groups, by the time aggro is stabilized, this DoT runs at best 5 of 6 ticks, more commonly, 4 of 6. Recycle times on our spells need to be drastically reduced - For every other class, mana is the limiting factor on DD DPS, not a forced 45 second cycle. Let us empty ourselves out in an orgy of spears. Add disease to the Malo/Malosi line. Institute more fast cycle dots.  While they're at it, reconsider the mana effiency of our spells such that they do not assume the full necro lich cycle. As a sub set, the pathetic greeness of the pet makes him use mage and other proccing weapons roughly as well as a wizard's familiar. Mobs that are light blue to me are yellow to red for it, and it cannot even reach a fraction of its damage capacity. <br />
<br />
4 AAs: Quite a few of the available AAs for SKs actively harm the SK. Cheif amoung these is Spell Casting Subtlety. No other class in the game has AAs that water down their innate skills or other AAs. Yet Weapons Affinity actually weakens Soul Abrasion. Many other AAs are broken or pointless. Leechtouch is right down there with Warlord's Tenacity, only it also wastes what could have been a 7-10k nuke, while being relatively resistable. I have yet to channel a spell through a stun, despite having bought Persistant Casting the day of GoD's release. These need the obvious fixes. <br />
<br />
5: Tank go squish. No stuns, no furious, no fears, no LoH, no heals, no defesnsive, nothing active that I can use to deflect incoming damage while waiting on a heal. If I HS or FD, I quite probably wipe a group. My lifetap is less than one half of one hit from a hard LDoN mob, let alone a mob with real attack effectiveness. All I can really do is pound HT and hope to take the bastard with me. <br />
<br />
Not all of these should be done together, but something should get done to move the SK upwards. Many of these problems existed earlier in PoP, but with warriors aggro in shambles, we were an alternative when a paladin was unavailable.</div></div><hr />

If you cant see that then I dont know what to tell you, Im tired of being a speedbump.  Glat...why do you want us to have a furious clone? Why are you so against knight weaponshield clones with the same refresh timer?  I know why I just want to hear you say it.  You or BB suggested that we be happy with weaponshield about a page ago, now that Ive shifted my opinion due to your continued opposition you too have shifted to see that it isnt reasonable anymore, why is that?  Furious complements defensive, isnt that obvious?  Thats why its 12 seconds.  Weaponshield has nothing to complement, it is the rangers only mitigation disc.<br />

<br />
I think knights should have a discipline like this, however if you want protection from all angles ask for an auto parry/ block discipline, if you want a riposte discipline then expect it to only work facing the mob, and don't expect to get a disc that is superior to any classes existing disc.

<br />
I don't see 60ish minutes, give or take, as horribly out of line.  Particularly if they shave a second or two off of it for Knights so it's somewhere over 12 seconds for Warriors and under 18 seconds for Rangers, lets say 16 seconds for the sake of discussion.  Then a 60ish minute refresh would seem to be right in line with other disciplines of this nature.  You might even be able to argue it should go a tad lower into the 55ish minute refresh.</div></div><hr />

I was never against a weaponshield like tool.<br />
<br />
I am not against a clone of weaponshield with same timers.<br />
<br />
I am not against spellbook type vie spells.<br />
<br />
I am against weaponshield that are front and back (something rangers don't get) for 30 seconds (longer than rangers) for 10 minute refresh (a seventh of the refresh) which is what YOU suggested.  That was what was insane.<br />
<br />
If you ask for a fortitude (dodge all blows) that lasts for 12 seconds / 40 minute refresh to 18 seconds for 70 refresh, I can live with that.<br />
<br />
If you ask for 24 second to 30 second parry (front only) with 80 to 90 minute refresh, I can live with that.<br />
<br />
If you ask for 6 second parry/riposte/dodge with 30 minute refresh, I can live with that.<br />
<br />
If you ask for a self vie that doesn't stack with cleric vie that mitigates 10 percent and lasts 30 minutes (or 2000 absorbed), I can live with that.  Brael/Jk/Keither were asking for 30/30 melee/spell.  It was proved that a 30/30 would actually prevent more damage than defensive on EVERY SINGLE MOB IN GAME from Kunark up (only old world mobs with DB of 0 would be mitigated better by defensive.  They refuse to confront the real issue.  They are insane.</div></div><hr />

Hahahahahaha .... not a chance in hell.  30 seconds of autoparry?

If you were to get a skill like that it would cost you at least 90mins .. preferably closer to 120 if you ask me.  <br />

*Furious/Fort for 2 ticks with 40 min refresh ...<br />
<br />
youre basically looking at 30-40 mins per 2 ticks ... so ... by all acounts a 6 tick disc should have a 90-120 min refresh.<br />
<br />
But then we're not even starting to figure on how a 24-30 second invulnerability disc (nearly twice as long as any existing one) can possibly be considered balanced.  Your suggestion makes me laugh.  Keep on asking for the moon there ... in the end it will only net you no upgrades.  Best to stick with a weaponshield clone, else you probably wont see jack shit.</div></div><hr />

One warrior agrees, the next one comes along and shits on the idea.<br />
<br />
Ok smartass, 3 (almost 4 omgzerts!) ticks on a 60-70ish refresh timer, gonna cry some more?  I already told you what you can do with your furious clone, it complements your  defensive, which I dont want, gee look at the sig.  Shaving what? 4 to 10 minutes off weaponshields refresh makes you shit your pants in shock?  SO imbalancing there, Im really treading on warrior ground now!<br />
<br />
Furious &gt; 12 seconds &gt; 40 minute refresh<br />
Defensive (mind you before or after furious) &gt; 3 minutes &gt; 10 minute refresh<br />
--------------------------------------<br />
3 minutes 12 seconds of inc damage mitigation per 40 minutes<br />
3 minutes of damage reduction per 10 minutes<br />
<br />
18 (24, since you know timing is so important here) seconds &gt; 60-70 minute refresh<br />
---------------------------------------<br />
18 (24 omgz!) damage immunity every 60-70 minutes<br />
<br />
How is that even reasonably close?  Remember now, rangers have utility and spellbooks too + tons more dps.  I know that you knew that already, I just wanted to make sure you didnt try the same old argument.  Oh and FD on any &quot;ohshit&quot; mob isnt even going to get done casting before I hit the floor, neither is harmshield so you can take those arguments out too.<br />
<br />
I dont want an exact clone, no its not exactly what I want, however its a huge help to pulling if nothing else than the fabled &quot;ohshit&quot; situation.  <br />
<br />
Get it through your skull, no more speedbump kthxllaallalaa.  Furious clone is underpowered, since we wont get defensive.  Weaponshield with slightly lower refresh is not the preverbial &quot;the sky is falling the sky is falling!&quot; that your making it out to be.<br />
<br />
Your suggestion makes me laugh. Keep on asking for the moon there ... in the end it will only net you no upgrades. Best to stick with a weaponshield clone, else you probably wont see jack shit. <br />

<br />
Weaponshield is/was officially a 3 tick duration disc.  Thing is it gives you the full 3 ticks + some if you start it halfway through another tick ... ie it will last you a guaranteed 18 seconds, but getting lucky witht the timing can make it last up to 22/23 seconds.  I'm not sure how much this has changed since the new disc timer window etc and the unlinking of discs as i have played my warrior almost exclusively since then, and i assume it no longer works on a &quot;tick&quot; basis but rather a set second count.<br />
<br />
Crimson i've said it before and i'll say it again:  I fully support knights getting an avoidance &quot;oh shit&quot; disc IN LINE WITH OTHER EXISTING MELEE DISCS.  The disc you're asking for goes above and beyond anything else like it.<br />
<br />
You, sir, did not ask for a weaponshield on a lesser timer.  You asked for a 24-30 second avoidance disc (which is almost twice as long) with a lesser timer.  A weaponshield clone on a lesser timer is acceptable, but honestly ... half a minute sans any melee dmg is rather ridiculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Crimson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Well its either 3 ticks or 4, make up your mind.<br />
<br />
3 ticks on a 60 - 70 minute refresh, autoriposite for sks, autoavoidance for paladins.  No I dont care if you feel thats imbalanced, no I dont think it really matters all that much in the grand scheme of things.  No Im not going to be MTing mobs for anything other than an ohshit situation with it.  Yes my spellbook will make up other defecencies with my class, including my dps/pulling/healing/stun problems in relation to you and paladins.  The dps part really irks me, since I tank the worst out of the 3 classes, and post time I fall behind in dps even when casting.  You have the best defense, I should be slightly behind you in melee dps, and blowing you out of the water when using my spellbook intelligently.<br />
<br />
Thats the end of the argument with me, Im not changing my mind another 14 times to suit every tom, dick, and harry warrior here.  Its reasonable, not the end of the world, if you dont like it, I frankly dont care anymore.  If the majority of your community agrees with this part, I will try to get the rest of my community to push this part as well.  Spellbook revision isnt my forte, nor is it yours, but thats the major thing now that we will work on ourselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">4 ticks of immunity for melee better have a refresh time measured in DAYS, not minutes.<br />
<br />
The fact that you even suggest for longer melee immunity than the best tank (2 ticks) is pretty ridiculous in itself.  The reason why Rangers get 3 ticks on their disc is because they don't tank.<br />
<br />
The fact that a Ranger is more likely to save a raid via 18 seconds of 'tanking' with WS than any Knight should tell you that 100% melee avoidance abilities are overpowered.  It's bad enough there are so many of them in the game already but asking for more?<br />
<br />
Knights were never meant to get 100% melee avoidance discs.  For that matter, you were never even supposed to get any melee avoidance discs, and you still don't have any.  Maybe you should look at Warlord's Tenacity and realize the cost it'd take to get any kind of get ouf of jail card while tanking, and realize how stupid that demand is.  100% melee avoidance skills are even more overpowered than Defensive because they allow recovery from arbitrarily bad situations as long as melee damage is the only major source of damage (and plenty of such encounters).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">3 rangers can basically prove to be the difference between a win and a wipe with chain ws when tanks are dying.  18 seconds is far too much for any other class.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I found Arathena's post interesting and worth a careful reading.<br />
<br />
There's a difference between recognizing a need (&quot;SKs should have some sort of ability to deal with oh shit moments&quot;) and discussions of the characteristics of a spell/skill/disc that would solve that need.<br />
<br />
There are several potential &quot;needs&quot; concerning the SKs. Some percentage of warriors (but I think a very small percentage) reject the idea that SKs need anything at all. I think a very high percentage of warriors, however, recognize that at least in some respects, SKs are getting the short end of certain sticks.<br />
<br />
If we begin with a consensus or at least an open mind that SKs might need some sort of help, then we can attack the specifics of proposed &quot;fixes&quot; rather than each other.<br />
<br />
I want to suggest here that a productive discussion will go faster if warriors assume that Crimson and other respected SKs do not really want SKs to be overpowered. If a suggestion is made by him or anyone else for a solution to a recognized need, and that solution appears to be overpowered, then point out the way in which it is overpowered or might be exploited. But don't immediately jump to the conclusion that the person who proposed a given timer on a given /disc is seeking to break the game.<br />
<br />
The reason I find Arathena's post interesting is that it operates at the level of experienced limitations of her class. Warriors are fond of telling everyone that they are indeed the best tank when the going gets brutal. Indeed, it is in our class description, and it's why I play a warrior, and why I put up with certain limitations (such as having almost no capacity to solo). But, as Arathena points out, the SK description suggests SKs can really put the hurt on mobs. But in fact their sustainable dps is pretty low, and it gets lower if two mobs are beating on them at once. Even the things SKs are able to do pretty well -- for example, generate hate -- are sometimes achieved through inelegant means. I find it inelegant class design that for much (all?) of an SKs life he or she generates much of this hate with two casts of clinging darkness.<br />
<br />
If solutions to all potential SK limitations were found, SKs (or any other class, really) might be overpowered even if none of the individual fixes were overpowered. But there's no disadvantage to discussing fixes to any identified problem. No class is going to get all their limitations removed, for obvious reasons. But a menu of solutions does not imply that all of them are implemented, just that game designers would have a choice among workable ideas.<br />
<br />
What I'm getting at here is that sometimes people will flame others according to this formula: &quot;first you wanted this and then you wanted this and now you want this and it all adds up to you wanting god mode.&quot; That's false reasoning. <br />
Yeah, some people would be very happy to have game-breaking abilities, but trolls will be trolls. Some people honestly fail to realize how relatively small changes in the duration or refresh of an ability can make a huge difference in power. But, there's no need to panic when you meet someone like that or even to assume they are unreasonable. <br />
<br />
Suggesting weaponshield in and of itself is not stupid, for example. It might not be a good solution, but I don't see a lot of 70-ranger raids running amok trivializing content through chain weaponshielding, heh. Perhaps it is less exploitable precisely because of rangers' other characteristics, and that in the hands of well-geared SKs it would be exploited. Fine, point that out. No need to use the word &quot;stupid.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'll tell you what's stupid: I gotta go to work now, lol.</div></div><hr />

They could adjust one or two. More then that forget it. Also those 15-30 dps from spells for non uber lvl 65 SK could easily mean 30% dmg. Think on this, there are uber weapons out there, but there are no uber spells.<br />

but remember that even if rangers are considered as a tanking class, they still wear mail (not plate) giving them a lower overall AC (actually not that much with EP and GoD gears) and a lower AC softcap! see this  Defensive comparison of the classes   to convince yourself.<br />
Thus when a ranger disc gets to its end, the mighty ranger will learn humility by the domage he is starting taking compared to a knight or even more when compared to a warrior.<br />

Your all being stupid, pigheaded, and unreasonable now.  Furious, ok, 12 seconds and then we can pass it on to the rangers with their extended and unoverpowering disc huh?  Still a speedbump, and a much lesser one than a class that is not supposed to tank according to you, but they are the 4th tank when discussing balance relative to them that might keep knights down, make up your mind.  If I asked for furious, you would say we needed it on a three day timer for it to be balanced, you dont have balance in mind, you have the idea that no matter the situation, a knight should not recieve any type of non spellbook ability that could possibly make them comparable to you.  The gap between rangers and knights is not large enough to say that weaponshield is overpowered, step off your pedistal of misinformation and try again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The primary issue with the SK spell book is a much more significant lack of scaling to both progression and content than similiar existing issues with other spellbooks. For myself, during a grind, my mana contributes about 10-15% of my sustained DPS. In burn mode, it will go up to about 20%. For Brael, on the other hand, melee time lost to casting(And it happens), will actually cause him to -lose- DPS because of the speed and effeciency of his one hander. The only spell line where this does not occur is the ever resisted, low damage, long cycling spear. His mana DPS drop to 5% or less of his output. Burning his mana in a max-speed splurge causes him to do less damage than he would just meleeing. Because of his spellbook mechanics, a higher end SK is effectively punished for advancing his gear in a tank oriented manner. This happens to the SK and to the ranger, while all other mana DPSers are rewarded by higher mana DPS through focii and Ancient spells, the Uber raid reward Nukes and DOTs. <br />
<br />
More, our only active way to deal with incoming damage is the lifetap, which, without focus, is hardcapped at 47 DPS for Touch of Innoruuk, and 35 DPS for Touch of Volatis. Consider now, the 4 second stun that halts potentially thousands of damage, or the -1 DI which, on a mob with a DI of 50(very common in GoD), is saving probably an average of 100 damage per melee round, but this will heavily in real DPS saved. Stun and -1 DI scale to content, wether its doing 20 DPS or 2000 DPS. I get.. 47 DPS healed. If I have very good foci and all AA, that number goes to approximately 60 DPS, at least until I hit the bottom of a manabar that's (correctly)relatively shallow because of lack of Specialization. Meanwhile, the mob has gone from the 40 DPS of a slowed LDoN normal to the 1k+ DPS of an unslowable in Vxed/Tipt. -1 DI chugs along, DI's a lot larger. Stun is even more effective, cancelling out rounds of 4k or more. I've got.. 60 DPS healed, and I go splat in a place that both warriors and paladins of my progression level can handle.<br />
<br />
For knights to be correctly configured, our active, mana limited abilities must be the element that allows us to surpass our lesser, unlimited, passive abilities. In their current state, the SK spell book both fails to allow us to exceed our passive melee output at all levels, and it significantly fails to either scale to content, as slows, stuns, defensive, complete heals do, and it fails to gain the needed scaling from gear. More, there must be effective utility to 'give reason' when the superior parent classes exist. For this occasion, the SK spell book contains an inferior mana pump, a low effectiveness pulling toolset, and snare. It never has been terribly effective at anything much besides aggro, and as mentioned elsewhere, the PoP SK didn't really do much beside ride the aggro coattails of the other knight. This is why the spell book needs rebalanced - it does not adequately meet the tasks set before it, leaving us as the third(or lower) string in all our roles, not even second best at any of them, and in limited cases, can actively interfere with the roles it's supposed to support.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">you have the idea that no matter the situation, a knight should not recieve any type of non spellbook ability <br />
<br />
yes it's part of my opinion.<br />
<br />
I personnally think that hybrids (not only knights) shouln't have any disc nor any focus and lesser FT and mitigation/avoidance than none caster/melee (depending on the side we look at) , BUT I think they should have the exact same gears and same spells than their parent class.<br />
<br />
It would be easier to balance since we would consider hybrids as the base and then pure melee/caster as a one-skill-tree developpment from them, and thus focus would manifies the spell effectivness and FT would increase the 'casting endurance' , while disc would manifies DPS or tank effectivness and mitigation/avoidance would increase the 'fighting endurance'.<br />

But it's not the case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Strange, but for years Warriors had the choice of either using furious and then waiting 40 minutes to be able to use defensive or not using furious at all and keeping defensive ready.  No one screamed that defensive was underpowered without furious.  No one screamed that furious was underpowered without defensive.  In fact furious was hardly used at all except very situationally beause the down time without and &quot;defense&quot; oriented discipline available at all was too extreme.<br />
<br />
You don't need a combination of defensive and furious to tank.  Hell, Warriors don't need a combination of defensive and furious to tank, it's just very convenient to have them both.  But remember, furious will be gone for 40 minutes once it's used.  So attempting to portray it as this big crutch Warriors are using all the time is inaccurate.<br />
<br />
Asking for something &quot;like&quot; furious and something &quot;like&quot; defensive is asking to be something &quot;like&quot; a Warrior with a spell book.  I realize that's not what you're really doing.  What you're trying to do is make the point that 12 seconds isn't long enough.  I'm not sure I completely agree, but I'm willing to concede the point, 12 seconds isn't long enough.  But you haven't made a case that 24 seconds is what is needed.<br />
<br />
Repeatedly I've asked you why Shadow Knights need such a long duration on a &quot;furious&quot; or &quot;weapon shield&quot; like discipline, and repeatedly you seem to have ignore or skirted the question.  Now, Crimson, I'm asking you straight out.  Why do you believe that Shadow Knights need a riposte discipline that lasts as long as a Ranger's?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">There are four major situations where a Shadow Knight is looking for a significant damage reduction tool. <br />
<br />
1: The XP 'Oh shit'. You know the scenario: One tank, one healer, the mob spikes half way through the cheal, and you aren't real likely to survive till the next heal. Or the cleric has to pay attention to the enchanter whose mez just got resisted With slowed stuff, the paladin pops a self heal / stuns, the warrior can pop the most appropriate of Def, Evasive, Fort, furious, the SK taps.. and frequently winds up healing himself for about half, or less, of a hit. Here too, paladin heals can fail, but much less often than the lifetap - His heals are usually at least one hit at a DI of 10, the tap much closer to minimum. FD puts the mob on someone who will probably become a grease spot, typically the healer, and has the attendant issue of several seconds to regain aggro once standing again. DA/HS can also do the same. Kiting is typically insufficent. Sometimes, HT can be used to put the mob in the grave. More often, it just means the wizard has to tank for 10 seconds instead of 30.<br />
<br />
2: The puller's 'Oh Shit'. Monks will know this one quite well: You hit the dirt, it fails/is broken by a caster, and now you have 5 unslowed mobs wailing on you while you wait on FD refresh(and recast). A monk will stand, punch Stonestance, Earthwalk, or Voiddance, and most of the time, he'll get around to that second feign. The SK probably won't, unless he's got running room, a rare luxury. Pulling, lets say, General Rapearm, you want that extra safety margin of 'Oh shit, he pathed on me'. If the stars align, HS can be used for this.<br />
<br />
3: The Offtanker's predicament: Three high cons, and one named of death hit the camp at once. Debuffers and healers are heavily focused on the named and the warrior tanking him. If the offtanked mob is of significant power, he can roll an underhealed knight (or warrior) easily, and move on to munch the healers. The same 'what else will it hit?' issues of 1 apply. Depending on a variety of factors, the offtanker may have to go between 6 and 24 seconds before his mob is debuffed, and is ideally self-sufficent during that time. Warrior have the /discipline options available, paladins have the stun/root/heal package, and the SK has the combination of taps and snare, but are often space/immunity constrained against kiting. Taps, as mentioned earlier, are often insignificant in the face of an unslowed mob's DPS. As I've mentioned before, a solid SK debuff could go a long way here.<br />
<br />
4: 'Oh, shit, that was the last warrior, NOT THE ASS! NOT THE ASS!' Fairly self explanatory. It's happened to me that once the last warrior went down, rotations were able to stabilize one me to carry the mob from 30% into the dirt. Much more often, the mob crumples me in about 2 seconds, my corpse gets 4-5 flash heals, and the process is repeated with all the other knights. For this situation I have nothing but 'Please Innoruuk, please let me use the lube.'<br />
<br />
My personal /disc of choice would be stonestance, primarily for the non-directional reduction and quick cycle time - I'd see most use of it as a pulling/offtanking tool. It should not always be needed, but it should be available frequently. Any damage reduction discs should probably be tailored towards 2/3, marginally useful for 1, and 'set rotation only' on 4. 18 to 24 seconds is ideal for 3, 12 to 18 is sufficient for the remainder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are two other reasons you didn't list for Knights wanting &quot;burst mitigation&quot;.<br />
<br />
1. Warriors have enjoyed a major prefernce in hunting goups going after one groupable named mobs ever since Kunark. Eventually for any given mob additional levels, better equipment, or tacitcs emerge that allow these mobs to be tanked by Knights. This is what Crimson was angling for, &quot;burst mitigation&quot; to eliminate a Warrior cutting edge situational advantage and a traditional role in hunting such mobs that has existed for four years.<br />
<br />
2. An &quot;oh shucks&quot; mitigation ability that can be used on basicly every mob to artificially enhance undergeared Knights so they can out-perform their deserved and intended limitations. It's not &quot;oh shucks&quot; if it's usable on every or nearly every mob.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Well I can't speak for time/GOD people +, but, our knights do fine.Most of our knights tank all the stuff I do in groups and become raid speed bumps about as fast has number 4 + warrior in our lineup usually.If the healers are not focused on you when Rape hits the camp you're normally toast,be you the sa or necro number 5.Our disc's are part of our tanking edge that helps to distinquish us from knights and personally I don't want to see that differance mitigated after being so recently retuned.<br />
<br />
Paladins are a pretty powerful class already that bring a lot to raid and group encounters.The hardest group stuff that I tank at the moment is probably in tipt and most of our pallies do fine there.In fact in a pet reliant group they probably do better with stun.I agree that SK's need to be improved to better balance with Paladins.I just think that the paladin's advantage is drawn from his spellbook so that's where SK's should be modified.Giving Sk's more warrior style tools isn't the answer imo.If they are finding their shadowy roots to be ineffective or weak compared to holier types than that should be fixed.An SK should be able to use his dark magic in every day play to his benefit equally as a Paladin does his own brand of hocus pocus.It's what gives their classes identity.An SK shouldn't have to resort to taking on more warrior like traits and bagging his spellbook.<br />

We're only in the ep's.On our raids our knights have more to do generally than the warrior assists excepting the sa and myself.They always seem busy and productive using their assets constantly in support of the raid force.They offtank quite a bit and I'm always happy to get a knight to ma clearing with a warrior  taking aggro on harder mobs when desirable.If this balance is seriously affected in time and god raiding than I think that the content is either poorly balanced ,or,you're on the cutting edge of stuff thats too hard at the moment due to levels &amp; progression etc.In neither case should the tanking distance between knights and warriors be affected in such a way as to narrow the margin in lower content.The gap there was just retuned as is.If Knights do need improvement post time than I suggest their spellbooks are the appropiate place to turn.<br />
<br />
In EP content I believe paladins remain a very strong class.An equal stength paladin can tank any of my xp groups and probably a large number of our raid targets.SK's in equal gear at this point seem to tank fine as well.They do seem weaker than their knightly cousins casting wise though.I'm all for putting the fear and pain back into the SK. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I suspect, Battleblade, that your suggestion that some Knights want those two results is correct.<br />
But  let's say that the specific problems Arathena lists exist and are serious issues for SKs. (My experience with SKs is markedly limited, but my SK is sitting on my shoulder nodding his head as he reads Arathena's descriptions.)<br />
How, then, can a mitigation improvement/tool be designed for SKs that produces these desired effects without generating the two results you suggest?</div></div><hr />

I've told you what I think is appropriate, and why I desire them. The only time I have ever said 'We need /disc tanking for this.' was on a GoD sewer run before the rebalancing. My next thought was, 'We'll take one of the warriors with better gear than me, and do the run twice, once to get my group through, once to gimp me through.'<br />
<br />
Many overdone solutions have been proposed. Many were put together not to steal your precious, but as gee, this would be perfect wishes, with out real thought as to what other limitations we (don't) see on the other side. I've played a warrior above level 50 a total of twice, I've popped furious maybe once and defensive twice, I'm paper familiar with them, much the same way your total familarity with what my spellbook is what you read in Lucy. Most shadow knights haven't even done that much. <br />

<br />
If you get geared up in GoD, would you be able to tank away in time? But with your current time gear you are able to say tank what? What percentage of GoD are you unable to tank? Is it all of it or just the raid targets?<br />
<br />
What im trying to get at is is it that the content is one of the major problems? I personally that anything that is SINGLE group doable should be tankable by all 3 tank classes who are gearing approiatly.  If there is a new RAID level mob that should be the warriors ground.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I really don't get why Knights are supposedly asking for 'watered down' versions of various discs that are actually better than any discs anyone already get.<br />
<br />
Makes me wonder if Knights even care about balance at all.  For example, you know Stonestance lasts 2 ticks right and takes about 4 minutes to refresh right?  Or that Furious only lasts 2 ticks with 40 minute refresh (and here duration is way more important than recast time).<br />
<br />
A watered down stonestance would look something like:  Mitigate melee by 70% for 2 ticks, 5 minute recast, 500 mana cost to activate (endurance cost completely irrelevant for Knights due to no way of using it).  Now that's something that might be at least halfway reasonable.  But I sure don't see anyone asking for that.  A 4 tick 100% melee avoidance disc is not a watered down Furious.  It's Furious on steroids unless the recast time is 3 days, and even then, I wouldn't be surprised at all if people just have some Knight blitz team they use to easily take out any one melee-based uber every 3 days.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">SKs keep asking for some sort of help precisely because of functionality issues as outlined by Arathena above. <br />
When a solution is proposed, and that solution appears overpowered, it's false reasoning to conclude that &quot;knights don't care about balance.&quot;<br />
Solutions to these issues (or the subset of them that should be solved versus the subset of them that will simply remain limitations of the class) are going to be difficult to tune. Over and over again skills/spells etc. have been employed in ways that developers clearly didn't foresee when they designed the spell/ability. But we keep blasting people who make proposals that are overpowered, and that's the wrong response to SKs like Arathena.<br />
It has the effect of rewinding the entire discussion back to the beginning: we unspool (more or less fragile) consensus, and we get no where.  <br />
The issue is more complicated because of the extreme level compression with respect to power at level 65. (That is, the difference in power between two level 65 characters now can be huge; one lvl 65 warrior might have 1200 AC, 4K hps and six general AAs but the next 65 War might have 2300 AC 9K hps and 200 AAs.) I'd be pretty surprised if similar spreads of power werent' the case across most class lines. Thus, when you ask SKs what they can tank, heh, the answer is &quot;it depends.&quot; <br />
I think level compression (for lack of a better term) is something that will have to be factored into the tuning of any sort of skill/ability/spell set that SKs get. And, tuning becomes more difficult if you think only about producing a skill that is functional in a raid setting then only then consider what effect that same skill might have in a normal LDoN setting.<br />
Then there is the question of how an SK would &quot;earn&quot; any such skill/spell. At some point in this thread a suggestion was made that a spell be no-dropped from GoD from (I think) a raid encounter boss mob. Well, that would solve problems for 5% of the SKs who can get there, but not for the 95% who can't. (Obviously I'm pulling these percentages out of my ass, but you get the point: if SKs get some sort of boost in hard-mob &quot;oh shit&quot; off-tanking ability, for example, it does little good if the offtanking SK cannot actually acquire that ability).<br />
Rhetorically speaking, at this point I should offer a solution set that would not be overbalancing but which would give SKs active things to do to help their groups/raidmates/guilds. I haven't proposed such changes because, honestly, I can't figure out what would meet the criteria of &quot;functional&quot; but &quot;not overpowered&quot; over an entire range of hunting environments (end-game raids to exp. groups and even to farming).<br />
My inability to to figure out a proposal so far, however, does not lead me to falsely conclude either that the underlying difficulties for SKs are trivial/do not exist, or that no such solutions are possible, or that SKs don't have any respect at all for balance in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Kitas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I personally don't see any problem with knights getting a heavy mitigation ability.<br />
<br />
I don't really care what all the warriors say, and I'm not a knight in warrior disguise, what I do care about is game balance.<br />
<br />
Whats apparant, though they fucked it up, is in GoD, defensive can make or break a group.<br />
<br />
Warriors job is to tank brutal mobs better than anyone else, which IMO means current raid names, not XP names.<br />
<br />
The class defining ability Defensive, should be the dominant choice of disc during &quot;brutal&quot; tanking, but not the only choice possible.  Which currently is the only choice, its defensive or raw tanking, off set slightly by Bulwark of Vie, and +shielding items.<br />
<br />
The problem I see is that, even if a warrior is lesser geared, say.. 500hp less than a knight, warrior's defensive discs makes him unbelievably tougher. Which is unfair, because Knights are tanks also, and the gap is substantially bigger than &quot;5%&quot;, defensive itself gives you a 45% mitigation.<br />
<br />
How many raid mobs survive way past the 3 min timer on defensive? Alot<br />
How many one group mobs survive way past the 3 min timer on defensive? Very few<br />
<br />
Warriors &gt; Knights in raid, Knights &gt; Warriors in XP.  That was somewhat of the way it was balanced out, and thats fine with me in keeping it that way.  But when red con mobs are hitting for 1800 and one groups supposed to take it out, who here would honestly rather pick a paladin/SK over a slightly lesser geared warrior?  It definately doesn't last the whole 3 mins.<br />
<br />
What I think would be a decent solution to the problem is to give Knights a very short duration mitigation spell, call it holy/unholy whatever.  Say 42 seconds of 30% mitigation, with a reuse of 10 mins, or such. I don't agree that Knights should really get a weaponshield type deal, because melee immunity discs aren't tank discs, its survival disc.  Rangers use it to buy time, warriors get a short version which helps us smooth out defensive and early aggro, and helps us live in a shit-hits-the-fan situation.  Being that we are warriors, we are entitled to both. But a lesser tank should be entitled to a lesser tanking ability.<br />
<br />
Also making it a spell will force them to use a spell gem, which would be the downfall, but making it short like 42 seconds makes it appealing to group mobs and offtanking, but not raid encounters.  So this allows a Knight the ability to hold their own in XP groups, but warriors will still be the preferred choice in raid encounters.  <br />
<br />
I also think warrior aggro is quite overdone.  LDoN augs + incite made our aggro appealing, but adding in WA5 souped up our aggro too much, but thats just my opinion.</div></div><hr />

Is it really up to Warriors to come up with proposals to fix Shadow Knights?  We're not the players of the class, we're not necessarily (although some may be) all that familiar with their spell books.  And franky, we probably can't accurately pin point where they're struggling the most from a second hand perspective.  We are, however, in a good position to make some judgements about how melee changes they might receive would impact the game in various ways, because we are melee specialists.  I know what defensive can do.  I know what furious can do.  I have a good idea of what handing those to Knights and allowing them to retain their spell book will probably do.  I, on the other hand, don't have a really great handle on how their life taps aren't keeping up with the content and what might be a reasonable fix for that. <br />
<br />
Yet most Shadow Knights don't address those areas where they are clearly falling behind, the spell book, with Arathena being one exception.  Instead what they generally do is lament how bad off the spell book is and then immediately demand melee changes to compensate for that weakness.</div></div><hr />

Point taken, however far too many warriors forget that their &quot;Hellfire missiles&quot; are unique, namely fire and forget discs. Anything spell based is far riskier to use to balance given fizzle, interupt, spellcast timing, and the fact that the aforementioned spell (whatever it turns out to be) has to have some aggro to it to undo the lost dps at a minimum (and at a maximum the lost aggro that could have been achieved by an outright stun, at least for pallys, which would be blocked for a min. of 3.5 secs due to refresh). Although this point is a little more questionable given the decreased aggro due to decreased dps when defensive is in play, but then pallys dont have fire and forget incite and a boatload of procable hate. Balance is key and its harder to do with the spellbook and that is likely why the spellbook has fallen behind. SOE is not known for taking on hard very often :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Actually, no, I don't think it's necessary for warriors to propose optimal fixes for SKs or any other class for exactly the reasons Glatius points out.<br />
I'm not sure that it's entirely necessary for SKs to make the perfect proposal, either, as a matter of fact. <br />
Luckily, we don't have to. Developers do. If (and heh, that might be a big if) we can come up with certain known and unfortunate limitations of SKs as a starting point for &quot;a set of things to consider fixing some or all of&quot; that might be helpful for the people who are in fact the only ones who can institute actual changes: SOE employees.<br />

<br />
So if the max level was 46, and Sebilis was a new zone, who would you pick to tank named mobs in seb?  A warrior with defensive or a knight?  You would pick a warrior because the game is busted.  That doesn't mean you should add all the skills a warrior has to the knights and then tell all warriors, &quot;you shall not pass&quot; and &quot;you really should stop playing eq, theses are not the fun times you are looking for&quot;<br />

Also, if anything warrior agro is UNDERDONE.  It still sucks with everything available now.  I would trade WA, anger3 for a single reusable aggro tool like stun or snare.  I couldn't give a damn if some dumb wizard can nuke all he wants 40 seconds into a fight, I want to not be losing agro every 3rd pull in exp groups because there are so many paladins and most any group isn't ready for a warrior that has sucky agro ONLY because they don't have raex bp, dbotw, eoe, sotp setup.  If you don't have all those items, your aggro as a warrior is trash.</div></div><hr />

First off what is fizzle rate of lvl 65 knight? 3%? less? <br />
Interupt I'll give you that but spells you going to be using in combat are usually very short cast specificaly because of that issue.<br />

As the expansion becomes a little more tirivized by gear such measures won't be necessary and the Warrior cutting edge advantages vs. those particular mobs will disappear. It really doesn't take long in most cases. I enjoyed maybe a month where I got a stream of requests to do Fungi until I saw Knights on my server doing it with no problem.<br />
<br />
A little quote from BB's Post.<br />
<br />
To me this illustrates a HUGE problem.<br />
<br />
First, I completely disagree that warriors have the exclusive right to do cutting edge content and that Knights just have to wait till their guild has advanced 3 zones beyond before they can play.  A well geared, well played knight should be able to do single group content.  I  would say if that is not the case then the content is poorly tuned.<br />
<br />
Second the Idea that you could just log a toon on and someone that doesnt play that class can preform the job illustrates a problem with content.  I like to think that in my 363 days /played I have honed some skills in playing my class that are beyond what someone with my password could do.<br />
<br />
Balance to me means that players of equal exp and equal gear all are desired in both raids and exp groups.  It does NOT mean we all do things the same way.  We are at the mercy of developers for content that is tuned to achieve this goal.  Exp content that requires that 3 specific classes are required in each group and all the other classes have to fight for the remaining 3 slots is poorly designed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Base rate on fizzles is roughly 5%, with the possibility of each spell having its own fizzle rate adjustment. The higher the spell level is compared to your own, the greater the chance of fizzle. Level 65 spells seem to have a rather high fizzle rate, though I can't yet back this up by parse, unfortunately.<br />
<br />
Casting timing while tanking is an interesting set of if then statements, especially considering the presence, and variability, of slow and haste. My personal weapon of choice is the Greatstaff of Misery, a 35 delay weapon. Under full haste, I am at a combat delay of approximately 1.7 seconds. The mob I am fighting, depending on his current haste slow status, will be between a delay of about 1 and 6 seconds, approximately. To avoid a channeling check /and/ maintain full melee DPS, I must cast only spells of shorter than 1.7 seconds, and I must also fit them between mob swings. Should I be hit, I will have a channeling success rate of around 75%, thanks to an assload of AAs, so long as I am not stunned, in which case the interrupt is guaranteed: The Persistant Casting AA apparently does not function as advertised. Now, a fair number of my spells are either 1.5 or 3.2 seconds base cast. With innate haste, the 3.2 second spell mods to 1.8, and my lifetaps are cheif amoung them. Therefore, every time I cast a lifetap, I must lose 0.1 seconds of melee. If I was wielding a WMBS, I would lose 0.4 seconds of melee. Wielding a Gem encrusted axe cost, at a delay cycle of 1.1, it's now 0.7 seconds of melee per cast, almost a full delay cycle.<br />
<br />
The above begins with the assumption that I am ignoring mob melee. If I choose to optimize my cast start time for channeling, tossing spells between mob casts, the lost DPS increase can be exponential. Wielding my 1.7 delay weapon, it's very likely that I may have to wait, say, 1.3 seconds after my attack for the mob to return it. There's a reaction time, and now, I have begun a 1.8 second cast, with 0.3 seconds of delay remaining on my attack. It cycles, and my attack round is delayed by 1.5 seconds, nearly a full attack cycle. The next delay cycle begins at this point. Do this with a Gem Encrusted axe, at 1.1 delay post haste, and now the cast begun with 0.3 seconds still becomes a wait of 1.5 extra seconds: an extra delay cycle and a half! Four, five, six casts a fight, for aggro and damage, and it starts to add up.<br />
<br />
Many other times, casting is something that must be done on a reactionary basis, and the luxury of carefully weaving spells through melee has to fall to the wayside. Cleric took aggro on that add? Better start casting on it, hell with the one chewing on my ankle. Low health aggro? Now I've got 2+ mobs pounding on me out of sync with each other - Windows of casting opportunity often simply don't exist when you're getting pounded on. There's a big difference between the on paper of Lucy and what happens when the shit hits the fan. These are the limitations of spells.<br />
<br />
In some of the places I mentioned earlier, spells can usefully be coded to deal with these situations.  The Offtanker's issues and the exp uhoh, for example, could each be handled with their own spells. The Speedbump is probably mostly hopeless, but it would be kinda nice to stand up to a mob for 12-18 seconds as opposed to 1-4. And the puller is actively harmed by a spell: While being hammered by many unslowed, or even hasted mobs, damage tends to come in as a continuous sheet. A defensive spell is not only going to be extremely difficult to channel in this situation, general spell refresh time may likely actively interfere with his ability to recast (Or first casting of) FD at the correct moment. <br />
<br />
Disciplines are proposed primarily because in some of the situations where these abilities are most desirable, spell casting is at it's nadir of relative usefulness. As well, current knight disciplines are a pale shadow compared to the disciplines of every other class that recieves disciplines. If I'm lucky, I might gain 2.5kHP over 24 seconds with Leechcurse, as long as I stop casting to deal more melee damage, and I don't get stunned. I regularly xp in places where mobs can do that in one round of combat, let alone 24 seconds. My other discipline is a once off focus for a single nuke, and the nuke recycles faster than the focus does. The SK turns around then, and he sees Rangers with two highly powerful discs, he sees the bard with a massive focus to all songs and a 100% mitigation disc, he sees the beastlord with two of the monk's most powerful discs copy-pasted and renamed, and he wonders, 'What the fuck? Why aren't their discs as shitty as mine?' You could take away my entire disc set, and the only time I'd notice is when the wizards out crit my HT. Paladin discs are even less useful. Redressing this is a thing that appears valuable and fair to many knights. The correctness of redressing that in terms of game balance is highly debateable, and I think I already know where most stand on it. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">ok that post I dont necessarily I agree with since I have played pure casters and knights enough to know drawbacks of casting a spell or two. Saying that you may delay by less then a second your mele each time you cast a spell is fine and true statement. However underlining it as a noticeable crippling condition is not. Every hybrid worth their salt instinctively knows to start casting right after or during the swing. Even assuming you got a really good damage low delay weapon you are not doing more then 100 damage on average per swing. How many spells do you cast per average fight? I doubt swing delay is significant enough to be mentioned here. Obviously no one is casting spells that do not benefit them or the group enough to justify it. Enough said.</div></div><hr />

It means that spells have to be designed such that the result vs loss is acceptable. Personally, I'll drop between four and six 1.8 second spells per mob. Wielding my two hander over a one minute fight, damage loss is negligable. Wielding my one hander, at a hasted delay of .95 seconds, I'll lose somewhere between five and ten percent of my melee output. Because of poor weapon itemization, my one hander is worthless anyway, and that 5-10 percent difference is easily outdone. Losing 5 DPS out of my 120 2-handed melee to generate 20-30 DPS is a good trade. At the upper end where a fully buffed knight may be doing 150-210 DPS via melee, throwing out 15-20 DPS to generate 20-30 isn't exactly the best situation. It's not 'crippling', but rather, as I gain power through content, my static spellbook is forced into a lesser and lesser position. The relative power of the spellbook to my melee side and to content plummets. The situation is functionally identical to the lack of scaling in lifetaps: My 47 DPS healed against a 30 DPS, slowed LDON mob rocks.

Warriors don't have &quot;exclusive rights&quot; to cutting edge open zone single group content. Feel absolutely free to engage any mob you want. That's what I do. If a mob isn't a current raid target, I don't even think - &quot;Can we take this?&quot;. It gets pulled and killed just like anything else except we go &quot;Woot&quot; at the end when someone gets the loot.<br />
<br />
You may find that there are some mobs beyond your capabilities, but you are welcome to try if you can get a group to go with you. I'm welcome to try too, and has been the case since the game began I'll sucessfully MA more open zone single group named mobs than you. I did so before Kunark and in every expansion since. It makes sence if you think about it - a group is just a raid force of 6.<br />
<br />
Yes, you don't Tank higher DI unstunable mobs as well as I. Of course I don't heal as well as you either, or for that matter solo as well either, but you don't seem to want to talk about that now do you?<br />

When a solution is proposed, and that solution appears overpowered, it's false reasoning to conclude that &quot;knights don't care about balance.&quot; <br />
<br />
 It's not false reasoning when, after being told that /defensive is not on the table, some Knights keep proposing /defensive clones, which, of course, is my main problem with the Braels and Kethers of the Knight classes. Fortunately there are MUCH more reasonable people in both classes with whom it's great to have a reasonable discussion. Once again, it's a minority in both classes that are pushing for it, but they are VERY vocal and they tend to use data VERY selectively.</div></div><hr />

Anyone who played the game knows this is complete and utter BS.<br />
<br />
There's a long standing difference between an experiance group tank and a group tank in cutting edge content going after named mobs. Everybody knows it and players look silly when they claim otherwise.<br />
<br />
At Bemyen's AC and Hp's there are many named one groupable mobs he can MT. However at my AC and Hp's and Defensive there are a few mobs I can MT that he can't. If this wasn't so, then there would hardly be a reason for Warriors to exist would there?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Kitas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">So if the max level was 46, and Sebilis was a new zone, who would you pick to tank named mobs in seb?  A warrior with defensive or a knight?  You would pick a warrior because the game is busted.  That doesn't mean you should add all the skills a warrior has to the knights and then tell all warriors, &quot;you shall not pass&quot; and &quot;you really should stop playing eq, theses are not the fun times you are looking for&quot;<br />
<br />
Also, if anything warrior agro is UNDERDONE.  It still sucks with everything available now.  I would trade WA, anger3 for a single reusable aggro tool like stun or snare.  I couldn't give a damn if some dumb wizard can nuke all he wants 40 seconds into a fight, I want to not be losing agro every 3rd pull in exp groups because there are so many paladins and most any group isn't ready for a warrior that has sucky agro ONLY because they don't have raex bp, dbotw, eoe, sotp setup.  If you don't have all those items, your aggro as a warrior is trash.<br />
<br />
<br />
You gotta be shitting me if you think warrior aggro REQUIRES DB/Wa5/Anger3/Incite.  Difference between good warrior aggro and shitty one is how much time/effort you put into your own character.  If you don't have the time, or don't want to have the time, or don't care to have the time to make YOUR class maximized, then don't bitch about warriors sucking at this and that. Warrior's aggro, IMO, is too good, and unfair for the superior aggro/inferior tank class that is the Knight.  I'm in no way saying go ubers, die casuals, but if you can't put the time into making a class thats reliant mainly on gear and AA(time), the best you can, then don't expect the best you can get.  You can't expect a cake to be fully done when you only have time/desire to cook it for half as long, eat the half baked cake, or make a different recipe that doesn't take as much time to get the same results.<br />
<br />
Also why SHOULD it be a warrior's only job to tank new content? You want to tank a mob that quads 3k, grab a raid and hire a warrior.  You want to tank a group required mob, its completely unfair to make the only viable tank a warrior.  When I do KT/Ikkinz trials groups, if I have a knight in the group he plays DPS, thats not their job in a group, they should be the tank, and I should be in another group tanking also, yet people don't want to pick knights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But look at it from another perspective BB, If a knight has 11k 2200 AC, and a warrior has 10K 1.9k AC, who's gonna tank better when it comes down to the named? Warrior will when he uses his disc at times that its neccesary.  A group would much rather choose to have that warrior tank the named, which shouldn't be when the gear gap is substantial.   Yes warriors are obviously gonna be better tanks, but its almost like comparing a Humvee vs a M1(when we kick in our disc).  The defense that it only lasts 3 mins is a poor one IMO.  Just like a game of chess, moving your piece to give it greater mobility doesn't always make it a good move, timing is important too, we don't cycle our defensive during XP grinds, we use it only when its neccesary, at which time 3 mins is somewhere close to 100% of the time period.  <br />
<br />
I really don't see a short duration, ~6 - 7 ticks worth of mitigation at around 2/3 of our mitigation value to knights, unfair to us warriors.  We will still dominate the tanking field, yet now knights won't be  just slightly above 3rd rate tanks. As is now, I see the gap between 1 and 2, much bigger than the gap between 2 and 3.<br />
<br />
Also the thing about putting time into it, I don't consider improving your aggro in the same category.  Tho in a sense, if you aren't gonna put in the time to gear up, don't expect to tank like a geared up tank, thats true.  But Wether a Knight has 100 AAs, 300 AAs, or 700 AAs, this tanking ability is capped by his gear, which he is limited by his guild's progress and loot control.  Aggro on the other hand, isn't.  You don't need anyone but a pick up group to do LDoNs, to get ur anger 3s, and you don't need anyone but a pick up group to grind XP to get your weapon affinity 5, and if you have both, you're pushing out some hardcore aggro.</div></div><hr />

If the game doesn't have plate classes sharing so much loot, you might have a point.<br />

But my point is, &quot;everything else&quot; the trash mobs, the xp mobs don't really matter, only thing you're doing by being a better/lesser tank is conserving the healers mana.  What does matter is when you get to the named and the knight falls considerably behind a warrior because of our defensive, even to the point where a only the truly uber knights can play w/ the big boys.  <br />

This is the part you don't understand.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter once the mob is slowed, you will not lose aggro.  Even with WA5, two Anger 3 on anger procing weapons, you will have trouble often in the first part of the fight before slow.  Not every mob, but often.  Also, in most places in GoD you can reach kills per hour of close to 60 (below KT, like vxed, etc) and at 60 kph, you can't incite every mob.

I'm glad you make that assumption of me, and i'm also glad that you think warriors can't get aggro pre-uberness.<br />
<br />
The balance of better aggro lesser tankability vs better tankability with lesser aggro has slimmed down too much.  <br />
<br />
BTW- I AM A WARRIOR, and I am in no way saying fuck the warrior, what I am saying is we have our place, and we're intruding too much into another's place. I believe in game balance, which many have no concept of.  If you think my view of balance is unreasonable, give me an intelligent argument, not a fucking I'm guessing you're a knight with zero fucking experience, so shut the hell up.<br />
<br />
Put yourself in an unbiased perspective, or if thats too difficult, try being as unbiased as you can and Ask yourself this one simple question..<br />
<br />
If you were the group leader and you were told to find a tank, currently, to do something even remotely difficult, ie: High Risk LDoN, and there's an unknown warrior and a knight, be it pally/SK LFG.  And you aren't allowed to ask their HP/AC etc, which one you gonna pick? The warrior, and I can guess majority will agree.<br />
<br />
Ask yourself that same question pre-LDoN, Knights were the preferred choice.   I 100% agree that warrior's aggro was too poor to do the job in fast paced short fights, ie xp grinds, pre-LDoN.  What I also agree is that with all the current aggro improvers available to us, NOT EVEN CONSIDERING WEAPONS, its too much.<br />
<br />
One last question you should answer, if Sony, tomarrow gave us an extra 1k HP for no reason, an innate weapon affinity + WA5, improved furious - say 24 seconds like WS, and an assortment of other things, would you keep your mouth shut? I can guess you would, I would bitch that warriors are over powered, so that makes me... &quot;a knight with NO EXPERIENCE being a warrior &quot; ?</div></div><hr />

That is a total crock of shit, With that much aggro procing, you rarely scare a slower. The issue of slowing too early isn't even a fucking issue anymore since I got all those, I can pull 4 mobs in BoT/Normal LDoN at a time, and pose less threat to the slower than I do to myself even tho he's working hard to get them all slowed.  Occasionally you won't proc for a good 15 - 20 seconds, but when you have 4 aggro procs + wa5, the should be issue isn't an issue, which shouldn't be that way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It has only been repeated about 30-40 times.  This is only part of the expansion and when OoW comes out, your issues might subside some.<br />
<br />
Just a thought.<br />
Historically, expansions have been a time for knights to bend over, grab their ankles, and start wincing. We have been told time and time again that 'we do not use expansions to balance classes'. And, judging from the list of spells in Lucy, they've got no intentions to start with this one. Unless it turns out that the pet has 30k HP and can /pet shield me on demand, not a single one of the points I have raised is addressed by the tenative spell list for SKs. No, I don't expect that pet to have those attributes either. The time to make valid points and suggestions is now, when they can go in smoothly with the expansion, as opposed to having to hack them in later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Kitas,<br />
<br />
Arathena provides a partial answer and you provide the rest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why&quot;, you ask &quot;should Warriors have an advantage tanking cutting-edge single-group open zone named mobs?&quot; And you further opine that we are stepping on another class's territory.<br />
<br />
The answer is the nature of the Warrior's survivability advantage and what cutting-edge content has meant for four years in this game.<br />
<br />
The Warriors suvivability advantage is most powerful in short duration fights where the mob's DI is high enough that other classes have difficulty surviving. Therefore it is particularly well suited for tanking more difficult progression content in a new expansion, especially higher DI than encountered in previous expansion single groupable mobs.<br />
<br />
The newly encountered named mob hits harder and the fight lasts around three minutes or less - a situation tailor made for Warriors.<br />
<br />
Warriors have the ability to be unmatched at surviving the most brutal battles. A cutting edge single group mob is going to be pretty brutal and Warriors are going to have survival advantages when facing it.<br />
<br />
This is the Warrior Class Description almost word for word in action using the precise methods Verant and later SoE implimented it.<br />
<br />
To be perfectly honest, this part of the Warrior advantage COULD have been minimized IF Verant had wanted it to be. Make Defensive &quot;-5&quot; DI for 6 minutes instead of &quot;-10 DI&quot; for three minutes and the cutting edge single group named mob Warrior advantage is reduced conciderably without (perhaps) eroding the Warrior raid MT role a great deal.<br />
<br />
EXCEPT Warriors are not and never have been just raid MT's. We are the 100% Tank that anywhere in the game in any sized group has unmatched survivability vs. the most brutal mobs.<br />
<br />
Defensive as it is insures the excitement of MT's dropping like flies (as in facing AoW back in the day) when your guild isn't really ready to face Mob_X with all of the frantic changing the target of the CH Rotation and timing that requires. It means guilds can't get along with just 2 equipped to the max Warriors and no other Warriors ever necessary.<br />
<br />
And yes, like Arathena notes, it limits the role of Knights vs. harder hitting cutting-edge content INSURING that Warriors get to &quot;take the point&quot; and do exactly what they were promised in their Class Description. But, Arathena omits the fact that caster and hybrids tend to get their spells rather early in expansions which means that Knights get their secondary raid roles almost in full-bloom as they gain new levels or first enter new content - no &quot;gearing up&quot; required.<br />
<br />
On all other mobs, what Arbosch calls &quot;trivial&quot;, Knights (particularly Paladins) are preferred. As they gear up the number of mobs and situtations they enjoy a preference increases until at the end of an expansion a guild like AO has Druids MT the hardest mobs in the game just because they can.<br />
<br />
You want a game where Paladins have a Tanking preference? Try FFXI. Paladins with a Warrior sub job have darned near an unshakable lock on every facet of the game.<br />
<br />
In EQ, that is what Warriors were told we were going to get and what we got. Knights can get exp group tanking slots, add tank and plow tank in raids and depending on the state of their equipment MT all but maybe 25 mobs in the game. PLUS they have powerful spellbooks useful everywhere.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen Druids being group main healers yet vs. named in Kod'Taz. The Prime Healer and Primary Tank have an intended preference in cutting-edge content. Without it we need not exist as distinct classes.<br />

I really like the idea of  &quot;/pet shield&quot; I think it is freaking awesome. A unique SK skill. That fits well into everything really. Althought I dunno how many HPs a SK pet have thought. Maybe make it mitigate a lot during the disc or somethin.<br />
<br />
Warrior agro... I dunno I quit a year ago I didnt have agro problems then. I'd imagine with incite and anger3/WA warriors do not have a right to bitch about agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">The question of SK desirability as MT against cutting edge boss mobs is a qualitatively different question from the situations Arathena defined in post #291 of this thread. I'm inclined to believe that it's a different kind of question entirely from the other functionality issues faced by SKs, and warriors are simply not going to agree that knights should have parity with warriors against those specific mobs. <br />
<br />
In fact, I wouldn't like to see it, even though I have some sympathy for an SK who has made every bit as much effort to be a good tank as the Warrior MT and yet is not the choice for his guild's &quot;big deal&quot; raid targets, and at the same time has seen his &quot;non-tanking&quot; functionality progressively eroded the farther he gets into the game's top content. <br />
<br />
I'm just not convinced SKs who want cutting edge boss mob MT functionality are going to get very productive dialog with warriors on this issue, and to the extent that these discussions tend inevitably to flame fests, such discussions make it difficult to address topics on which SK and warrior discussion might be productive.<br />
<br />
For example, I can't see why SKs' pulling functionality shouldn't be upgraded. For places like LDoNs, a group with a bard pulling is much more efficient than a group with a monk, SK or (bleh) a warrior and cleric doing the pac thing. I don't see improved SK pulling in and of itself being a game breaker or that it would step on my warrior's toes too much. In fact, my warrior really likes to have an SK in his groups because I think that SKs and warriors are a much more complimentary combination of melee for a group than most players realize. As it often happens now, if my warrior gets in an adventure, the group frequently won't look at an SK because &quot;we already have a tank. What we need now is a bard/puller.&quot; This might result in bards and SKs doing LDoNs together less often, but I don't think it would make it impossible for bards to get groups.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">about SK's pet enhencing, what about a &quot;doppelger like&quot; pet.<br />
<br />
I mean a way of summoning his own shadow to act like a pet. thus it would have the exact same HP/AC/AA/spells/geras/... his name would be SK_=!'s Shadow, it would be its same graphic but in pure black. <br />
<br />
This would be a great looking, and very power full pet. it would  theorically double the SK capability but without stacking them. I mean, if he can't tank alone he won't be able to tank with his pet (except if both use Zev's and thus double the group heal power, but ...). Actually it would just do what a pet he meant to do : ease what is possible. <br />
This means that is solo power will be greatly increase, is group role will be greatly increase (leting the pet tank alone while the SK pull, ease the pull spliting with two pullers, tanking two mobs at the same time, ...) actually it would give a free player more to the group (7 players in LoDN or GoD trials !), but it won't help him to face mob that can one or two round him because the two can't tank the same mob at the same time (there is only one player at the top of the hate list). <br />
<br />
to prevent fast recast when pet falls, a long cast delay with a little expensive reagent would balance this spell (after all we can zone with pet now, and if SKs have the suspent pet AA, it give them actually a strong back up when the first fall).<br />
<br />
I would appraciate little trollish post on this on fron warrior, and SK thoughts would be appreciate (I said thoughts not whinnes)<br />

<br />
A lot of people have completely different ideas of power.  Myself, I consider the fact that SKs can pull a &quot;very&quot; powerful tool.  I wouldn't have a single high risk LDoN win right now if it wasn't for my SK friend pulling them.  Our bard guildy hasn't learned how to pull them yet, I have yet to group with the only monk we have, and I certainly can't pull a high risk LDoN without killing us all as a warrior.  Pacify gets resisted too much, so I can't do it with my cleric either.<br />
<br />
As I've said before in previous posts, my SK friend can 3-box high risk LDoNs.  Why?  Cause he can consistantly pull singles.  I can't even approach that.  I consider the ability to hunt and win a high risk LDoN a VERY powerful ability considering if I were in his place we wouldn't be able to pull even the first room.  The fact that because he's an SK instead of a warrior makes it possible.  That's power.  Making what is impossible for my class possible because of his spell book... that's power.  A lot of people ignore that and pass it off as a small utility that doesn't mean much.  It's not a small utility, it's a huge advantage and a skill that I covet greatly.  If I had that one skill, I could hunt high risk adventures alone with my characters.... but I don't have that skill, so I can't.  He has that skill so he can.  That's power.  That's power that needs to be taken into account when balancing the class, because it massively effects what the group can and can not do.  That's power.  That one skill makes the impossible possible (compaired to how well my class can do it)... that's power.<br />
<br />
In fact, my warrior really likes to have an SK in his groups because I think that SKs and warriors are a much more complimentary combination of melee for a group than most players realize.<br />
<br />
We're very complimentary I agree.  I've said it many times before, that his aggro equals my aggro.  I love that fact that SKs can build this massive instant aggro so that the slowers can slow immediately.  One tuant and it's all mine, followed by an incite to insure it stays mine.  If tuant fails, that's okay, someone pretty beefy is taking the hits instead of the slower till I can get a successful tuant off.  A warrior and an SK together can pretty much guarentee that the casters will never get hit, and massively reduce the chances that the cleric will be chaining quick heals and running low on mana at the start of the fight.</div></div><hr />

Warriors have the ability to be unmatched at surviving the most brutal battles. A cutting edge single group mob is going to be pretty brutal and Warriors are going to have survival advantages when facing it.<br />
BB<br />
<br />
<br />
Then it looks to me that you and I have different opinions on what a &quot;brutal&quot; fight is.  I don't see it being fair for a one group targetted mob to be so &quot;brutal&quot; that only a warrior is viable, that to me, belongs in the raid department, in a group, &quot;brutal&quot; means knight qualified, warrior certified, but not as viable to 3rd rate tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">The balance of better aggro lesser tankability vs better tankability with lesser aggro has slimmed down too much.  <br />
<br />
If you were the group leader and you were told to find a tank, currently, to do something even remotely difficult, ie: High Risk LDoN, and there's an unknown warrior and a knight, be it pally/SK LFG. <br />
<br />
One last question you should answer, if Sony, tomarrow gave us an extra 1k HP for no reason, an innate weapon affinity + WA5, improved furious - say 24 seconds like WS, and an assortment of other things, would you keep your mouth shut? <br />
<br />
The issue of slowing too early isn't even a fucking issue anymore since I got all those, I can pull 4 mobs in BoT/Normal LDoN at a time <br />
<br />
There never was a &quot;balance&quot; of better tank/worse aggro vs worse tank/better aggro.  In fact, it used to be &quot;better tank/better aggro vs worse tank/worse aggro with spells&quot; according to Verant.  SoE didn't retain that part of the &quot;vision&quot; and left the spells high aggro in game.<br />
<br />
You are a fool if you think ANY paladin with LR5/ID5 and his spells isn't a better tank for ldon hard, vxed.  Just plain raving mad.  I would pick a 9k/1800 ac paladin over a 11k/1800 warrior ANY DAY OF THE WEEK for hard ldon, vxed, and tipt if I also had an enc/ranger.  If you pick the warrior (regardless of gear) you are making things harder for yourself than they need to me.  You are a warrior (but you sound like a knight) so you may not know that almost every enchanter would pick the paladins.  I know several enchanters that would MUCH rather not deal with a warrior no matter how much better they are, if they can get a paladin.<br />
<br />
If Sony gave us all those things you suggest, I would be complaining also.  But I would be complaining they are giving us stuff we don't need instead of fixing the problem (the lack of aggro generation we have.) <br />
<br />
See, you don't have any high end experience.  Bot/Ldon, I don't have much of an issue there.  I don't have much of an aggro problem like in GoD because aggro is jacked up in GoD (which makes the SCS many classes got needed) and if you train in SCS3 you end up being around where you were in BoT/Ldon before GoD's SCS3.  Either way, you have no experience in Vxed/Tipt/Ferubi because the aggro there is significantly worse than BoT/Ldon.</div></div><hr />

Then it looks to me that you and I have different opinions on what a &quot;brutal&quot; fight is.<br />
Take any hard hitting open zone named mob. There's no sign on them that says one group, raid, 8 person only.<br />
<br />
Let's suppose this mob is too hard for ANYONE to handle as a Tank in a single-group when first encountered. A Warrior_01 and a Paladin_01 each get get a couple pieces of armor and some augs and now are at:<br />
<br />
Warrior - 12500HP's, 2400AC, and has Defensive<br />
<br />
Paladin - 10500HP's, 2400AC, and a spellbook containing many spells having nothing or little to do directly with tanking but a great deal of value when there is no danger of getting hit and interrupted.<br />
<br />
Who do you want to tank? The player who's class has unmatched survivablility when taking the point vs. a brutal mob OR<br />
<br />
A player who's class is primarily a melee that fights in the front (head to head) but enjoys stepping back from fights and casting spells.<br />
<br />
If the mob has high DI and can't be stunned, I would ask the Warrior - that's their speciality.<br />
<br />
If it's a fairly trivial fight but the mob AE's and there are adds all over the place then I'd ask the Paladin. Versatility is their forte.<br />
<br />
So yes, we have a different definition of brutal. Mine is based on mobs that have appeared in the game, the Warrior Class description, and the tools Verant and SoE has given Warriors for the last four years or so.<br />
<br />
Having in fact MT'd for single group cutting edge hunting parties and one-grouping former raid mobs for several years, no one is likely to convince me I didn't have a major preference and that preference wasn't based on &quot;unmatched survivability&quot;  per the Warrior Class Description and the way I invoked that greater survivability wasn't through Defensive.<br />
<br />
You are pretending otherwise in order to try to make a case that it wasn't a longstanding traditional Warrior role based on our Class Description - it was and is.<br />
<br />
This is not to say that exceptionally well equipped Paladins can't often tank such mobs from the get go or that some of these mobs aren't relatively trivial when first encountered. But these mobs are not and never have been one size fits all.<br />
<br />
A brutal mob (as meant in the Warrior Class Description) is one where a Warrior is forced to invoke his unmatched survivability (use Defensive, Evasive, Stonewall) to MT and survive and other classes lacking these abilities generally fail.<br />
<br />
The trials having been converted into what has been refered to as &quot;EverQuest for Kids&quot; is not the proper template to apply to open-zone named mobs. Else, why be a Warrior and forego a powerful spellbook - for the joy of being a SL/HL recepticle on 1 raid boss mob on raid day IF you are selected to MT?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Bemyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">Well I for one dont hide my spell book under my robe.  I embrace it.  I have spells with tremendous utility.  That being said if we are taking about single grouped named mygroup heals and fast cast heals are basically meaningless.  Now if these mobs where designed with rampage that hit multiple targets or a mirror type defense that damaged casters or cast ae damage spells my group heals would have value.  I believe that the named in GoD where designed with warriors in mind.  They hit one single target very hard with melee damage and have low hit points.  Yes each class has unique tools but the value of those tools is only what content has to offer.  Knight can get a fearless aa making them immune to all fear spells.  If every exp named in Kod Taz and above cast a fear you can bet warriors would be demanding a fearless aa.<br />
<br />
I completly dissagree that Paladins should tank like warriors.  I remember leveling up in Seb and bringing value as a tank even back when Paladins had 225 defense cap.  Allthough I took more damage then warriors my stuns and sword of mourning was top notch for interupting casters.  If you dont think that had value then I guess you never had an Ilis Wizard gate and summon you into a disco full of frogs.<br />
<br />
My point is that content determines the value of classes, and current exp named maximizes the value of defensive disc and trivalizes Hybrid spell books.  BB and I have comparable gear and nearly the same number of aa.  My idea of balance is that we would bring roughly the same value in an exp group and a raid.  However due to the content of GoD that is not the case.<br />
<br />
In repsonse to BB's comment on a Paladins ability to solo.  It isnt too good In GoD.  I play 2 accounts and can do some low end blue mobs with my 65 enchanter or 65 druid as a second box.  However as someone that has 2 boxed for years I would say that a cleric warrior is about as efficent as a pally enchanter combo.  For the most part any attempt to solo beyond Plane of valor and I am using that spell book for a 90 percent res.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">Hmmm, Vikken, okay.<br />
First, SKs and Paladins are different classes with different spell sets and abilities. Not only are the two classes distinguishable, but not all members of either class always want the same thing. Claiming that they do and that therefore all questions pertaining to knight --, for example, SK functionality in specific situations -- are pointless is logically flawed in multiple ways: the major premise is flawed, the definitions are flawed, and the conclusion does not follow from the evidence presented.<br />
<br />
Second, a tank class that has a great deal of aggro on incoming does indeed have a value in exp. groups, particularly in cases of groups fighting an endless stream of single-pull blue mobs. However, the harder hitting the exp mobs, the more likely it is that a warrior is a better choice, particularly in situations where multiple mobs show up and the tank is going to have to take a few punches before crowd control gets the adds iced. Read what Battleblade just said above:<br />
<br />

<br />
Just as all knights are not the same, not all non-raid group situations are the same either. If your Magelo is up to date, in one level your Bloodsworn will start procing for you. When it does, switch it to the mainhand and your initial aggro and aggro over time are both going to go up. You should not have trouble with initial aggro in your experience groups as a warrior unless someone in your group is landing big hate on the mobs before they get to melee range. Contrast this with post 50 warrior problems getting PoP groups 8 months ago, when warrior aggro was dramatically failing to get the job done.<br />
<br />
Personally, I haven't seen a great deal of evidence that same-level/AA SKs or Paladins tank significantly better than my warrior in experience groups, given  equivalent gear. <br />
<br />
So, we have a relatively coherent description of specific limitations SKs face from Arathena. Some or all of them might be addressed. A specific discussion of specific problems in specific situations might be productive.<br />
<br />
I aggree with you that the subset of knights who would like abilities that would enable to MT end-game boss mobs the day a new expansion comes along are not going to get much lovin on the warrior board, lol. But then, that hardly makes the other issues or discussion of them quite pointless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">Aye Bemyen, I contend the groupable named have always favored Warriors when they were not merely named versions of yard trash, but difficult red mobs. But certainly even all the named mobs in Kod'Taz don't require Defensive. For one reason or another I've tanked some without it.<br />
<br />
Not everyone that stepped into Sebilis could MT at the Fungi Tunic camp right away. The Myconid Spore King at level 56 was conciderably more difficult than yardtrash named mobs found nearer the entrance.<br />
<br />
Once Knights were able to successfully MT him (which took a while indeed) a Paladin's stuns, heals, and Res became significant as did the SK's ability to reach the camp from zone in to replace a departing MT or to snare a mob that was running.<br />
<br />
From Sebilis to BoT tower named and beyond, Warriors have enjoyed an initial preference based on Defensive - their class defining ability (that will not be shared).<br />

My idea of balance is that we would be equally desired in normal experiance groups, have special value as distinct classes in groups not focusing soley on experiance, and have totally separate raid roles - mine is MTing hard hitting mobs/melee and yours is add tanking normal mobs/spot healing/group healing/Buffing/GRC/Res/CC/melee, etc. etc. etc. etc. Ya see, &quot;balance&quot; doesn't mean we should be compared my only strength against only one of your many many capabilities.<br />

The harder mobs hit, the more content moves from experience content. The harder they hit, the more likely it is that the warrior will use his discs, this is fine, they are his to use as he so chooses. In the case of multiples it just so happens that warriors were given abilities to handle these types of situations, its what they do. I suggest that these types of situations are not experience content as you suggest. Warriors chose their class based on the premise that they would be the most hardy and well skill melee combatant i the game. Knights chose to give up some of that for their spellbooks, if you are not happy with your decision, Brenlo has already stated that classes will not be definde by how they compare to other classes so if you are unhappy, you should try another class. There's plenty to choose from.<br />

The SoBS has been procing for quite some time. My weapon setup is the most optimal for what I do day to day. It maximized DPS and the stun proc on the fabled yak still stuns most xp content at my level. I'm happy. My agro is just fine, except for initial agro. Which is exactly why I love knights, especially in LDONs, their spell agro lets casters really let lose, making kills come faster.<br />
<br />
Personally, I haven't seen a great deal of evidence that same-level/AA SKs or Paladins tank significantly better than my warrior in experience groups, given  equivalent gear. <br />
<br />
You need to get out more. Granted, warrior agro isn't bad, its just the first few seconds we are talking about, but there is a knight (har har) and day difference to their agro abilities.<br />
<br />
So, we have a relatively coherent description of specific limitations SKs face from Arathena. Some or all of them might be addressed. A specific discussion of specific problems in specific situations might be productive.<br />
<br />
Maybe your right, but then again, maybe SOE just needs to rework the SK spellbook. Better spears/lifetaps from nodrop spells in upper level zones where SK are starting to have trouble tanking and offsetting the insane damage done by these mobs might go a long way to fixing SKs. Knights already have &quot;oh shit&quot; abilities, there no need to give me more.<br />

<br />
There is *no* SK inital aggro advantage at all. None. Aggro advantage is all on the warriors side now once they get to time level. The only thing I have is that I can hold a mob waiting for it to be mezzed with fear (in the zones where fear works).<br />

To give you an idea of the amazing SK aggro power... I have to wait on a successful taunt to break mez... our spells are just not enough to overcome the hate built up by the mez and slows etc unless you want to wait litteraly several minutes while i chain cast on it.

<br />
Assuming the stun issues with pallies (In Oowar) get worked out in some way...<br />
<br />
If pallies were given a 20% defensive, warirors would still remain leaps and bounds above the hybirds in tanking, and the sky wouldn't fall. Just like clerics having a CHeal that is unquestionably superior to druid/shaman CHeal, so would warrior tanking, with or without defensive, be unquestionably superior to knights tanking, with or without the knight's version of defensive. AS LONG AS knights were given a significantly inferior version of defensive. After all, warriors don't JUST have defensive. We also have furious, which helps out a lot too.<br />
<br />
I just don't see how the sky would fall, given past history with CHeal sharing, if hybrids were to be a properly balanced defensive that allows warriors to remain unquestionably the king of tanks.<br />
<br />
Now if the addition were to actually threaten the warrior's role... that's a different story. That's why I think they should only be given one or the other of short term and long term damage mitigation discs... not both.<br />
<br />
Additionally, the implementation of stuns for pallies in OoWar may mean that they don't need either at all. Stuns up to level 75 are almost certainly going to change tank balance in the pally's favor.</div></div><hr />

I only brought up clerics et al and CHeal when you responded with an argument that sounded quite similar to what some clerics used in the debate for and against CHeal being shared.<br />
<br />
In a previous thread you conceeded SoE was very unlikely to remove Defensive from the game after 19 pages of arguing otherwise.<br />
<br />
Again, putting words in my mouth that I never said. I NEVER argued for 19 pages that it would be likely that SoE would remove it. Did I say they SHOULD do it? Yes. Did I say they WOULD do it? No. There's a big difference between &quot;should&quot; and &quot;would&quot;.<br />
<br />
In another thread you argued a parse of a differently equipped Paladin and a Warrior with Shielding that the Paladin did not have proved conclusively that Warriors had a 12.5% INNATE mitigation advantage. A dozen pages of debate later you conceeded that the mitigation differnce was not innate.<br />
<br />
Again, I clarified in that thread that it was a TANKING advantage, not an innate advantage. Big difference.<br />
<br />
You're putting words in my mouth again that I've never said, how dishonest of you. As for whether it being &quot;innate&quot; or &quot;not innate&quot;... that's pure semantics.<br />
<br />
Now we could go back and forth over yer latest declaration for 10 to 20 pages in this thread and given precident in other debates you'd probably conceed that Defensive is unlikely to be shared. OR<br />
<br />
the rest of us here can save teh interweb as we know it and use your past debates as a model of how this one would turn out a month from now.<br />
<br />
My latest declaration? All I'm stating is that YOUR declaration with you like to being up every second post is not what you trump it up to be, due to SoE's own past history. Of course, I don't really expect you to want to accept it, you're FAR too fond of trumpeting that particular statement to let go of it easily.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 NOT irrelevant. You asked how they were different. That's one way. If you can't refute it, don't dismiss it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Assuming the stun issues with pallies (In Oowar) get worked out in some way...<br />
<br />
If pallies were given a 20% defensive, warirors would still remain leaps and bounds above the hybirds in tanking, and the sky wouldn't fall. Just like clerics having a CHeal that is unquestionably superior to druid/shaman CHeal, so would warrior tanking, with or without defensive, be unquestionably superior to knights tanking, with or without the knight's version of defensive. AS LONG AS knights were given a significantly inferior version of defensive. After all, warriors don't JUST have defensive. We also have furious, which helps out a lot too.<br />
<br />
I just don't see how the sky would fall, given past history with CHeal sharing, if hybrids were to be a properly balanced defensive that allows warriors to remain unquestionably the king of tanks.<br />
<br />
Now if the addition were to actually threaten the warrior's role... that's a different story. That's why I think they should only be given one or the other of short term and long term damage mitigation discs... not both.<br />
<br />
Additionally, the implementation of stuns for pallies in OoWar may mean that they don't need either at all. Stuns up to level 75 are almost certainly going to change tank balance in the pally's favor.<br />
<br />
 Daemon, with a 10% capped /defensive, a Knight was able to tank ANYTHING on raids a Warrior could, INCLUDING RZTW. Everything. Therefore, your 20% is too close.<br />
<br />
 There is NO way to make Warriors the unquestionable king of tanks if you give another class /defensive. None. The only POSSIBLE way would be to give them a mitigation advantage at least as large as the Cleric healing advantage over all spells. That would mean, in addition to under /defensive, a Warrior would have to take base damage, what, 30% better than a similarly geared Paladin? 40%? Can you see the balance changes if that went live?<br />
<br />
 As it is right now, the advantage without discs is at most ~15%, and in cases of similar gear, it's less than 10%. THAT'S why /defensive gets to be so powerful - because in relation to the hybrid class, it's base advantage is smaller than a Cleric's advantage is over healer hybrids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Darq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">I'm with you until the last paragraph, Partha.  Are you saying that Druids and Shaman are the healer hybrids?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">He saying that they aren't 100% healing. They have other primary roles that they can take in groups.<br />
<br />
I agree with the way things are right now with the tanks. Warriors 100% focused on tanking isn't significantly ahead of the other plate tanks in mitigation sans defensive. The way defensive works, by the timers and by the end costs, a warrior is going to save his defensive discs for emergencys, just like SKs and Pnights save thier &quot;oh shit&quot; abilities. In a fast chain pulling experience group, the warrior can't incite each mob, run offensive dics, and defensive disc, he has to choose one. The means that he sticks to inciting most mobs. So effectively, you have 3 plate tanks that are all fairly equal in desirability to experience groups, which is ideal.<br />
<br />
If it wasn't this way, and we used cleric healing a model, warriors would mitigate 40% better than the other plate tanks all the time. Its not hard to see that warriors wold be THE DEFACTO tanks for every situation including experience groups. Knights would be given a backseat in tanking like rangers have been given over time. I dont, as to others. believe that this would be desirable, since Knights have no other primary role that can take up in experience groups. The fact is that I think the reasons why knights seem to be so unhappy when the aren't tanking is because they lack a significant alternate role that they can bring to groups.<br />
<br />
I think this is what needs to be addressed. Knights have been screaming for defensive type (not like) discs for so long that they no longer realize why they are so unhappy. I don't think a disc is going to help them. Knights need a viable alternate role since tanking doesn't stack. DPS classes often don't have an alternate role and this is because DPS stacks, and does so very well. Even warriors have a alternate role, we can do DPS too, though its nothing to write home about, it isn't half bad and stacks well in situations where the warrior isn't tanking.<br />
<br />
Knights will never be happy util they are give an alternate role that stacks in every situation that where they are unable to tank. I'll leave that up to the knights to figure out, but I'll just leave them to thats and add once more, if knights get a defensive type disc, they are still going to be unhappy unless they are tanking because they have nothing else that they can to.<br />
<br />
BTW I still hear murmurs about knights getting creamed in GoD, well thats a content issue. New content will do this, until it is farmed or out leveled. Single group flagging is still not an experience group, You are going to have to farm it or out level it before you can tanking it as well as a warrior. I'm not meaning to incite more flames, but I suggest you look over what I've suggested on this post before going crazy over this last paragraph.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps I should have been more clear. When I asked for how they are different, I was talking about MEANINGFUL differences. The healing stacking isn't a meaningful difference in this context: the context of messing up the balance. As long as warriors remain prefferred MT on named, etc, the stacking just doesn't matter. <br />
Or perhaps you can tell me how it does?<br />
Hell, if anything, the non tank stacking issue would be a mark AGAINST the hybrid, not for it.<br />

Ah, you're talking about Bulwark of Vie. I'm quite familiar with this argument.<br />
<br />
Yuor argument is intellectually dishonest. While that succcess in tanking DID happen, you don't include its context: That being that this hapepned AFTER time had been farmed all to hell, and they had the gear to stand up to this kind of beating. See, it wasn't Bulwark alone as you seem to want to have people believe, it was Bulwark AND the gear. And who tanked Time first, allowing these people to GET this level of gear? That's right. Warriors. Not pallies or monks with a 10% capped bulwark, it was warriors. Any class that even remotely resembles a tank can tank content when you're already geared up in said content, hell, CASTERS can tank trivial content. That doesn't mean there's something wrong, that's just called mudflation and the gradual trivialization of content.<br />
<br />
If it was Bulwark alone, I'd agree with you. But since it's not, well, there's no problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
 There is NO way to make Warriors the unquestionable king of tanks if you give another class /defensive. None.<br />
<br />
Try not to be so closed minded. Were clerics all of a sudden not the unquestionable king of healers when CH got shared out? Of course not.<br />
<br />
<br />
 The only POSSIBLE way would be to give them a mitigation advantage at least as large as the Cleric healing advantage over all spells. That would mean, in addition to under /defensive, a Warrior would have to take base damage, what, 30% better than a similarly geared Paladin? 40%? Can you see the balance changes if that went live?<br />
<br />
Actually, no, there's several ways to do it. But at any rate, that would only be necessary IF the defensive given to hybrids was too powerful, IE, 30% to the warrior's 45%. Conditional of course, on Oowar stuns and how much they cgange the present balance. And remeber, that's JUST giving them a PARTIAL defensive, and no other disc. Just like druids got a PARTIAL CH. Knights wouldn't get the riposte disc, for example. And we all see how important that's becoming.<br />
<br />
Yes, it would take balancing. But the sky wouldn't fall down if it happened.<br />
<br />
As it is right now, the advantage without discs is at most ~15%, and in cases of similar gear, it's less than 10%. THAT'S why /defensive gets to be so powerful - because in relation to the hybrid class, it's base advantage is smaller than a Cleric's advantage is over healer hybrids.<br />
<br />
It's a lot more than that. I'll show you with simple math to illustrate.<br />
<br />
Warrior has a 10% HP advantage over knights, call it.<br />
Also call it a 10% mitigation/avoidance/AC advantage. Not quite exact numbers, but good enough for illustration purposes.<br />
<br />
So, we have:<br />
<br />
Pal with 8000HP<br />
War with 8800HP &lt;10% better&gt;<br />
<br />
Mob does 1000DPS to the pally.<br />
Mob does 900DPS to the war (10% mitigation/AC/avoidance difference)<br />
<br />
The pally, then, will die in 8 seconds without a heal. 1000x8= 8kHP = dead pally<br />
But, get this.<br />
The warrior, with his tanking AND HP advantage, will last NINE POINT SEVEN seconds, or 22% longer than the paladin!<br />
<br />
THAT, is just with a 10% HP and 10% damage taking advantage. Imagine the difference seen with the warrior's innate tanking advantage, HP, AND the full power def disc, while hybrids got the partial. I wouldn't be at all suprised to see the hybrid requiring 40% more/faster heals... is that not enough of an advantage to suit you?</div></div><hr />

 If you put a Warrior and a Knight in the same group, they can't both 'tank' the same target. One can tank, but one will be strictly DPS - and if you REALLY need DPS, you're not taking a Warrior OR a Knight, are you?<br />

 It's not intellectually dishonest to state that when the two classes are in the same gear level, that they tank about the same, even to the point of Knights being able to tank stuff that was originally broken with Warriors. Strong odds that had they used the same setup when they first tried all this stuff with a Bulwarked Paladin instead of a Warrior, success rates would be the same - all the /defensive was was a larger safety margin. One that doesn't get us groups, and one that doesn't mean jackshit against anything but the bleeding edge of the bleeding edge of content.<br />

 Incorrect, because the Paladin can heal HIMSELF and keep himself up longer than the Warrior. The Warrior's tanking advantage would have to be, again. larger than both the Knight's base mitigation plus the bonus HP included in the spellbook. Just how many heals does it take to get to the center of a mana bar?  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Yup... but then, that's a mark against the knight, how things wouldn't change as much as the changes did for clerics and druids. This isn't something that bolsters the anti-mini defensive argument, it bolsters the argument for its addition instead.<br />

<br />
It IS intellectually dishonest when you're using the argument as a basis for how the warrior's role will be threatened. Wizards at the same progression level can tank Avatar of War, too. The question is... does that matter? Trivialized content is not the role of the warrior, the role of the warrior is CUTTING EDGE content, and mini defensive won't touch it. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
No, it's not incorrect. The math is sound. Yes, heals may MODIFY it, but it doesn't mean the math is incorrect. And when they're busy trying to het those heals off, they're not adding DPS, they're not adding melee aggro, they're not adding stun aggro, and to hear knights tell it, they can't get off those spells to begin with due to melee, and even when they could, their heals are so tiny as to not make a difference! This isn't a free addition that hybrids can do ON TOP OF what the warrior would be doing in that situation, they pay for it in other ways. To even have a chance at lasting as long as a warrior in combat, they have to give up a very significant portion of their aggro generation and melee DPS, whereas the warrior has that ability to last WHILE doing good DPS, and WHILE adding aggro. <br />
<br />
Oh, and you know that 10% capped defensive you're going on about? Yeah, that STACKS with the useage of defensive, which maintains the warrior advantage, even increasing it a tiny bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">You're right, the math is sound. It's a damn shame that the heals DO MODIFY it, and consequently blow your argument out of the water.  And yes, they do have to give up DPS to cast.  News flash: We give up a significant amount of DPS when we're defensive.  But by all means, lets totally ignore all the disadvantages warriors have and totally ignore all the advantages that knights have, and balance them accordingly.<br />
<br />
At the risk of belaboring an already tired point: Tanking is all we do. No knight should ever be able to tank as well as a similarly geared warrior.  No knight should ever get anywhere near to tanking as well as a defensive warrior. Tanking is all we do.  Tanking really nasty stuff that everyone else is forced to shy away from is what we were designed for.  Guess what, we gave up alot for that.  <br />

<br />
Agreed. But then, nowhere am I asking for knights to tank as well as a warrior. That's way I'm careful to say things like: Don't give them both a short duration mitigation disc AND a long duration disc. Don't give them a defensive that's anywhere near as good as a warrior's defensive. Why? Because limiting it like that ensures that hybrids DO NOT tank anywhere near as well as a similarly geared warrior. I'm asking for balancing that specficially ensures warrior superiority.<br />
<br />
Take my recent outing against Kyv Heartstriker in Tipt. Do you think that a pally would have been able to get off enough heals to last as long as I did? Not bloody likely. At the very least, pally woudln't have been able to get off enough heals to stay alive, AND hold aggro.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the fact that the warrior would have in this case have gotten rid of over TEN THOUSAND damage with the use of furious. With as short of a duration fight as the Kyv fight is, there's not any hope in hell that the pally would have been able to heal enough damage to tank as well as the warrior.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, all other things remaining equal, giving knights /defensive is no different than giving warriors their choice of either a pally spellbook or sk spellbook.  Doing either of those things for one class fundamentally eliminates the need for the other class<br />

ONLY if you give hybrids BOTH furious and defensive, and b: said defensive is as powerful as a warrior's defensive. Sorry, the sky wouldn't fall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>Scal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">Something that doesn't match up with my logical thinking.... Even If Knights got a 2/3 defensive, how the hell would Knights replace a Warrior's raid role?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u114"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p114">knights with a 2/3 def disc wouldn't replace us on boss tanking in raid situation but they would replace us completly on one group content. leaving warrior in one single spot at all : new Boss Mob (not longly farmed one).<br />
moreover since the more AC you get the less DPS reduction you get from def disc, it would actually bring knights even closer to us in DPS reduction against boss mob, because it wouldn't have a 1/3 DPS diference between us and knights but much less. <br />
What I mean is that after you breaked the effective-AC-cap of a given mob, def is only useble to avoid spikes, not to deacrese DPS that much (that why very strong tanks, when backflaging, prefer to use evasive vs def : the spikes aren't deadly anymore and the DPS reduction is minimal), at htis point a 2/3 def is as powerfull as a full version.<br />
<br />
That's why it mustn't be given to them at anycost (even if def is nerfed even more, the gear difference is still in our advantage).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u115"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p115">Let's try to remember that after the first 3 minutes in a boss mob fight a Warrior is essentially a Knight without a spellbook.<br />
<br />
Give Knights 2 minute duration Defensive and the reason to add Warriors, which make up a large piece of every server's melee population, goes down significantly. After all, if you end up fighting a Rav in QVic for 8 minutes, then just how much burden is it for the MT to have Defensive for a little less time. Not much - guilds don't switch MT's when Defensive drops. Likewise, half mitigation Defensive isn't a big deal - if a Warrior can handle the mob just chain Vie on a Knight or spam heal a little. By going with all Knights a guild could add a bucketload of versatility.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if it was Absor or Brenlo that explained the situation by saying (paraphrasing) 'Defensive is a Warrior class defining ability that will not be shared. (fuzzy about this part) We are not about to strengthen Knights by victimizing another class.'<br />
<br />
And that's exactly what sharing Defensive or removing it from the game would be. Victimizing Warriors.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of opprotunities for those primarily melee classes that like to fight facing the mob with weapons to do so AND cast meaningful spells.<br />
<br />
****<br />
Making Knight classes fun to play, having a role, and having a distinct character giving them a unique reason of exist in all environments does not depend on making them virtually indistinguishable from Warriors, except that they have a powerful spellbook.<br />
****<br />
<br />
Knights like to say &quot;We are Tanks.&quot; Actually, they have it a little wrong - Warriors are Tanks. Knights tank and cast spells. Doing both, they are not going to Tank like a Warrior in harder content, or even real close to like a Warrior, and have a useful spellbook. The game benefits if their spellbooks have value in all enviroments (makes it more interesting) and their tanking is diminished somewhat as a cost of having that spellbook and the versatility it provides them.<br />
<br />
Knights chose NOT to be Warriors, yet their aggro is arguably just as good and they have 90% of a Warrior's survivability when the Warrior is not using a discipline - that's quite a bit given the wide variation of equipment players wear at every progression level. Oh yeah, they also have spellbooks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u116"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p116">that, obviously, is the reason why any addition given to hybrids would have to be specifically balanced so as NOT to threaten the role of a warrior.<br />
<br />
These doom and gloom pronouncements are only things that would happen, should this addition not be properly tested and balanced.<br />
<br />
When I tank in Kodtaz, when they look for a rep for me, they look for a warrior, and not a paladin. That's because as a Warrior, on a named, I can engage furious and take zero damage for the crucial first seconds of the fight while the mob gets slowed and debuffed, and then engage stonewall to do DPS as well as take less damage.<br />
<br />
This is not something a paladin with even half defensive can do.<br />
<br />
The warrior advantage is not just defensive, it is also furious.<br />
<br />
Any addition would have to be extensively playtested so as to not to not have the situation that you all are so concerned about, actually happen. Paladins just can't tank as well as we can, I don't see a partial defensive, properly tested and balanced, as threatening that. If it DID threaten it, then the fault is not in giving defensive period, the fault is in not balancing it properly first.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u119"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p119">First off saying that Shamans and Druids get CH is false. Granted a druid gets much closer that a shaman does. My lvl 65 Shaman with all the Healing Adept AA's done cast a 400 mana 10.0 sec cast heal for 2360 points. Improved Healing does not effect Ch or the 75% heals. A lvl 39 cleric can cast a CH for 400 mana 10.0 sec cast for 7500 with no AA's done. So no that is not even close in comparison. Yes a shaman slow reduces the damage greatly but heals were mentioned not other abilities. Once a cleric has there Healing Adept AA's the CH is for in the area of 9000 points. That makes the Shaman CH spell less than 1/3 of the clerics. Do I have a problem with this. NO I do not. A Shaman is a debuffer/slower/buffer and a patch healer. If a shaman can main heal the content is probbably trivial for the group at hand. Atleast alot more trivial for a shaman to main than it is for a SK or Pally to main tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u120"><b>Scal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p120">Yoda, that is correct. Even with a 2/3 defensive, Knights will never replace a Warrior as the Tank on Non-Trivial Raid content.  This is simply because no 100% taunt AA or Riposte/Parry discipline.  When the Warrior team has fallen, the rangers usually step up before the Knights.  This is because it requires the Stars to allign to get enough spot heals before Healing is set.  The taunt one is pretty logical.  If you want to test the waters of what its like without the Ripo/Parry discipline, As soon as the warrior ahead of you in the tanking rot dies, hit AE taunt count about 8 or 9 seconds, then hit defensive.  That will almost show you how good of raid tanks Knights are with a Knight defensive.  The fact is, one role Warriors will always have secure is the Raid tank. 99.9% of Knights completely understand and agree that Warriors should and will always be the Raid Tank.  I'm sure everyone at TSW, SK.org, and the Paladin site would agree with that.<br />
<br />
BattleBlade, you seem to have an understanding that the game is balanced on how fun a class is to play.  However, this is completely understandable seeing as I am posting on a Warrior board in the Warrior's Rants section.<br />
<br />
Knights are Tanks, we are just not meant to be as Good of tanks as Warriors.  Believe it or not, Tanking is a Knight's primary role.  <br />
<br />
I'm a firm believer that in an exp group, equally geared Warriors and Knights should be interchangable as the Tank.  The common belief is that Warriors should be better at tanking, while the Knights add more with utility.  That is pretty much the argument there, should Knights be balanced by utility [spellbook], while leaving their primary role to suck? While it is debatable over the boards, keep in mind that groups do not care much for utility. Are you going to chose a druid as the primary healer because of the druid's utility? Odds are if you even have a druid in the group, the druid is the secondary healer.  The reason Druids aren't up in arms about Clerics? Healing stacks, Tanking does not. <br />
<br />
What do Knights need? both the Paladin class and the Shadowknight class need some way to handle damage spikes (IMO our biggest problem with tanking).  I'm not going to go into what Shadowknights need for their spellbook on the Warrior board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u121"><b>Darq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p121">I'm not sure if it was Absor or Brenlo that explained the situation by saying (paraphrasing) 'Defensive is a Warrior class defining ability that will not be shared. (fuzzy about this part) We are not about to strengthen Knights by victimizing another class.'<br />
<br />
-Here's the link- (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=paladinbalance&amp;message.id=146#M146) from the SOE Paladin Balance board and here's the 04-23-04 quote from Brenlo (emphasis mine):<br />
<br />
<br />
Conor is correct, much of what is asked for by Paladins and SKs is specific to warriors and that will not be changing.  Like it or not, warriors are supposed to be and will always be better able to tank than Pallys and SKs.  The fact that warriors can tank the harder content in Gates,  while the knight classes cannot, does not mean Pallys and SKs are broken, rather that warriors are better tanks and that the content is too challenging.  There is supposed to be a disparity between the tanking abilities of warriors and knights.  Paladins and SKs want to be able to tank in the single group encounters, and they are right, they should be able to, but not at the expense of other classes.   <br />
<br />
So now a plan is in place to adjust the content so it will still be tough for warriors, while also being achievable for the knight classes.  Currently this is our solution.  We will not be adding defensive discs or abilities to the knight classes.  We will be tuning the content so that it is a challenge for everyone and excludes no one.  We want a group to be able to succeed with a warrior, shadow knight or paladin as a tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good news Scal, they are! <br />
<br />
Seriously,  it takes a fancy parcing program to surf through log files to tell the difference between warrior tanking and knight tanking. It seems like as long as the mob is stunnable there is no difference. So what mobs are not stunnable? Basically boss mobs, which are supposed to be &quot;our&quot; territory. This is why we look at pally's like their insane whenever they ask for &quot;better&quot; tanking.<br />
<br />
I agree that SK's got left in the dust when snare and fear got basically thrown out the window on post 55 mobs. So adding a &quot;stun like&quot; short duration snare/fear combo to the SK line up is really all that's needed. Beyond that, we have balance now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u125"><b>Scal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p125">Gunnar, your first two sentences are what I already said.  Your third sentence is well.... reread it and think of a tanking role.<br />
<br />
Gerick, thats what I said in my post  :)  The distance between Warrior and Knight doesnt bother me as much as being able to tank.<br />
<br />
Huz, atm they are not.  You want evidence? group with a Knight in qvic or such, or just look at how both Knight communities are up in arms.  And Like I said, boss mobs are definitely warrior territory.  And yes, SKs need something to compete with Paladin stuns, but thats an issue that shouldnt be discussed on the Warrior Boards.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u126"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p126">By your own logic, frig, giving hybrids a partial defensive, is not truly giving them defensive at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u127"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p127">Yup,I'm thinking of the tanking role.The hardest hitting mobs for a guild in non trivial content should require a warrior.When your offtanking you do so with mitigated resources and it can be equally challenging depending on healer support.So the hardest offtank mobs should be better tanked by warriors and more threating to knights.Generally warriors don't have discs to blow on every offtank mob either and still die from offtanking.They do have their omg discs to use once in awhile...it's part of the overall gap between knights and warriors.I tank the majority of bosses wih furious down and many without defensive.Our knights play a very strong role in aggro support with adds.When we're clearing at 90 kills per hour+the name i see most often in the HOTT window besides mine belongs to a knight.They have a great influence on smoothing our aggro control on clearing and we value their support.In groups they tank everything I do atm.In some cases groups are better off with their abilities in some with my extra hp/mitigation.<br />
<br />
This is a reflection of how things are running for us through ep content.I can't speak for time + yet because a particular shrimp is being troublesome,but, to adjust classes to make up for higher content would imbalance the classes for at least all content below that imo.SK's need some love though. :) <br />
<br />
Our pallies have less raid/dkp time  and can do amazing stuff;cover for sudden lack of heals in raids and groups, stun pets from across the room,rez me when i'm dumb,fd,snare blah,blah ,blah.Hell they even have fun soloing and a couple of them togeather can make a pretty kewl group try that with a cpl warriors hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u128"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p128">I think the main reason knights won't get a /disc defensive from SOE, even in a watered down version, is that SOE is aware of what happens when three classes perform the same non-stacking function in the same way: one or two of the classes stop getting groups and have a potentially large problem advancing their characters and are much more likely to stop paying to play the game.<br />
In other words, the position that knights should get a form of defensive requires agreeing with two separate premises:<br />
1. Knights need better burst mitigation<br />
2. Knights should have improved burst mitigation using the same general means as warriors use to mitigate damage.<br />
<br />
A person might well be open to #1 while being opposed to #2.<br />
<br />
Arathena's post a while back identifies certain situations in which SKs have some trouble performing certain functions: multiple mobs on pull and extremely tough off-tanking situations in raids, for example. Seems reasonable to me to at least look at these situations (particularly in the case of SKs) to see if they need some skill/spell bumps. However, plugging in the warriors' means of handling these situations blurs the differences between the classes in way that could lead to some unfortunate outcomes for the game, I think.<br />
<br />
If different classes approach the same problems differently, there would be a much stronger argeement for functionality in all three classes. If, on the other hand, they all perform their main (and, basically, only) task in the same way and present the same set of risks and rewards associated with performing that central role, then it seems to me likely that the player community itself would tend toward selecting one of those classes over the others in almost all situations.<br />
<br />
Certainly there are systemic problems with strengthening, say, SK's ability to tank by adding a spell or two to their books. For one thing, the main drawback to using spells in a tanking situation for SKs is not that they lose dps, but that the spell might never finish being casted. Defensive works no matter how hard the mob is or how many mobs are hitting you. But SKs have a problem in that just in those situations where their innate damage mitigation needs a boost from their spellbook, their spell book is likely to become less functional on a practical level. <br />
<br />
Still, whatever the problems of making an adjustment through spells or through some /disc that takes a different approach and has different drawbacks from defensive, the advantage is that any such change is less likely to blur the distinctions among the three plate tank classes.<br />
<br />
Oh, and to Vikkin: Well, I suspect that we're more in aggreement than either your rant or my (rant-like) response suggested.</div></div><hr />

Well, sure, it hurt clerics. It broke the stranglehold that clerics had on the healing role, it broke the nearly complete monopoly that clerics had in experience groups, while still keeping them the preferred healer in all but the most trivial of content.<br />
<br />
Saying that change &quot;hurt clerics&quot; is misleading. The fact is, the change was needed to correct an imbalance in the game. NO class should have an nearly absolute monopoly in a role in the vast majority of the game. Small, narrowly defined niches, yes. Broad areas of the game, no.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you have to do is look at it in the context of WHEN shamans got it. When they got it, it's a pretty good upgrade.<br />
<br />
That has more to do with the fact that the HoT's keep getting upgraded, while the percentage heal is a one shot deal with no upgrade... I would EXPECT that a spell that's 7-10 lowers lower is completely outclassed, especially when you consider that that they're focusable, while the CHeals are not... if it's not, it just shows the spell is overpowered to begin with.<br />

Knights should only be able to perform their roles, which are not the Warrior raid role.

Well this is the problem then isn't it?  SK's have no raid role and are tanks of last resort in single group GoD content.  <br />

<br />
And herein is where you completely miss the point.  If I was arguing that specific content was too difficult or a particular mob was too hard, then my opinion would have substantially more credibility if I'd actually gone up against that content or that mob.  But that isn't the issue, now is it?   The issue is you're pissing and moaning because a Warrior a tier or two below you has more HP than you do.  But what you fail to understand is that Warriors are, by design, intended to have more HP than Shadow Knights.  It's part of the balance equation.  And I don't have to have tanked boss mobs in GoD to know that.  So, your PoTime experience apparently has no relevance to the underlying issue, should Warriors in lesser gear still have the potential to have more HP than Knights in better gear?  The answer is, yes, they should.  And the reason that is so is because there are no circumstances under which a Warrior will ever reasonably compare in the casting area to a Knight.  This is a logical arguement.   It's not based on content experience or expansion experience.  It's based on having a freaking clue, which I seriously doubt you to have at this point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, finally we get to the real issue:<br />
<br />
Utility - a warrior with many years played will have clicky lev, clicky invis (yes it sucks but guess what the SK invis spell totally sucks too unless they have a circlet), enduring breath, see invisible and so on.<br />
<br />
Tanking and DPS - Warrior discs (yes I count these as spells in a way) add far more survibability than SK taps. And once you hit time+ level a warrior with their AA and decent weapons will outdps a same level SK using everything they have.<br />
<br />
aggro - Warriors have no problem with initial aggro now and generate far more hate over time than a SK can put out.<br />
<br />
The rest - dot snare and FD - these make us so-so pullers (worse than bards or monks).<br />
<br />
*Just point to where we have these awesome abilities that mean we should never come close to tanking close to a warrior*</div></div><hr />

Where is my clicky FD item?  Where is my clicky harm touch item?  Where is my clickly snare item that doesn't require I farm fungus grove?  Where is my clicky group mana buff item?  I swear to god these knights who try and equate clicky items to their entire spellbook and special abilities line up really piss me off.  Hey, you know what, you can have clicky items that buff your HP so that you have closer to the same amount a Warrior without them can have, are you now satisfied?

<br />
Who cares if a warrior disc can add slightly more survivability than SK taps?  If you find yourself in a bind that your life taps won't get you out of, you have a feign death button.  No warrior has that luxuary, I assure you.<br />
<br />
You also have an invulnerability spell.<br />
<br />
So if you look at JUST taps..MAYBE a warrior has more survivability than you.  If you look at the whole scope however, it's ridiculous to even assume that a warrior comes within a hundred miles of a shadow knight's survivability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What 'balanced' us was aggro... now we don't have that we need to be looked at again. Personsally, (looking at our parent class) to me that would suggest we could maybe do with a little more necro type utility and a bucket load more dps... because um necro's are a DPS class. Other disagree and want us to tank better (closer to warriors). I know we are a hard class to balance because we are going to end up stepping on someones toes... yours or rangers probably. Hopefully somewhere in between so we don't piss anyone off too much.</div></div><hr />

Since when?  Could you please link for me any post where I've said that Shadow Knights should not out DPS a Warrior when the SK is using their pet and casting?  In fact, show me a thread with any Warrior with any credibility has said that, and I'll be surprised as hell.</div></div><hr />

I'd support raising the weapon caps to the max for knights, as that would help a fuckton in the dps dept.  In order to do that and maintain balance, though, you'd have to have your wonderful little weapons altered and tweaked as they are some of the most powerful ratios in the game (and you get them relatively early).<br />
<br />
As for tanking abilities ... youre already almost too close to us in that realm unless you consider our discs which arent used 95% of the time.<br />

You are already there pretty much.  Give you too much dps and you'll top over some of the lesser dps classes while being a &quot;tank&quot;.  Give you any more tanking survivability and you'll pass warriors all around.</div></div><hr />

I still believe a better lifetap is in order. Currently it neither does enough damage or enough healing to mean a lot.<br />
<br />
I would still like to see SK's get a major debuff all of their own with no stackability problems (except with itself).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, SoE does not really discuss class roles, needed upgrades, and future directions much. My feeling is that SK's can and should be improved so they are fun to play and have a role in all environments while being a unique class with a distinct reason to exist in the game.<br />

This does not mean to me however that SK's must be able to completely duplicate those functions a Warrior provides.<br />

I'd like to see more done with the spell lines we have that just stop for no good reason. Like we get diamondskin (a rune spell) and then no others.

Ok, it might not seem like it from the way I post here but I'm mostly happy with my class. But I can see how I might not be.... in my guild shadowknights still trash tank, monks still pull and we find surprising uses for rangers (kiting and general CC, splitting mobs with weapon shield and stuff). But maybe for others warriros are now the tank for clearing, bards are doing the pulling and rangers feel useless.</div></div><hr />

The job of your class spokesman is to present your communities views to SoE and to start threads at their behest. The Class Correspondent role does not exist for them to advance their ideas nor frame the debate so SK's can't be heard. It's a secretarial role, not a leadership role.<br />

Knight unbuffed HP should fall directly between Rangers and Warriors.  The Knight self buffs (280hp or less) should edge the Highend Knights to be about ~1250 away from the rangers and ~1000 away from the warriors.  This results in a 9-10% difference in HP between Knights and Warriors and a 10-11% difference in HP between Knights and Rangers.  I don't believe the numbers are very far off at the moment for this to even be an issue.  <br />
<br />
Glatius, your arguments do lose much credibility as you have already stated.  But you are praising the Shadowknight spellbook when you have not seen it in action in the Areas where Shadowknights have problems.  The thing is, you have argued about Knights in Gates with no first hand experience.  <br />
<br />
Ezedriel, your tactics are great except that when Shadowknights harmshield or feign death, they lose aggro and generally the group dies. <br />
<br />
Battleblade, even Mages are complaining about their pets uselessness.  A Very large problem is that lifetaps do not scale with content like Weaponshield, Furious, Defensive, and Paladin stuns.  Lifetaps are healing.  Healing is not mitigation, Shadowknights still have the same odds of taking damage spikes. If Shadowknights need anything for their spellbook, it needs to be something that can compete with Paladin stuns.</div></div><hr />

No, what you fail to understand and what most Shadow Knights fail to understand, is that Warriors have some sympathy for Shadow Knight claims that their spellbooks have fallen behind the content.  This, however, is not justification for narrowing further the intentionally designed in differences between the two classes where Warriors are strong and Shadow Knights are weak.

Yeah, we're thinking a new stackable 350 HP buff and a spell based mitigation solution, say 30% DI reducer should do the trick. Since we're improving our spellbook, and not our melee side per se, I'm sure the Warriors will wholeheartedly support our quest. I hope we can count on your support Glatius.</div></div><hr />

Glatius, do you agree that a Knight's primary role is tanking?  Unless you can change my mind, I don't believe that a warrior should be the only viable exp group tank in new content. <br />
<br />
Our spellbook is falling behind indeed,There is not much a casted spell can do that will provide instant burst damage mitigation.  Stuns? Yes, I believe they should either tie stuns into our Spear DD line of spells (while lowering the resist rate and/or recast timer) or tie a stun into our broken Terror line of spells.  This will allow shadowknights to compete with Paladins.  <br />
<br />
I don't believe the last part was directed at me.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is that Shadowknights need some way to click a button to provide instant burst damage mitigation.  Whether this comes in the form of an instant cast spell, a discipline, or a high cost AA; I personally don't care too much as long as it is there.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure this is true.  I believe there are a number of ways to approach it.  Some of which could be though the spell book, some of which could be something in the way of a discipline.

Yes, one groupable content.  I think if you read my previous posts you would know my stance on raid tanks.<br />

Defensive is sure as hell one way to solve it.  There are other ways, but none of them are as effective as a 2/3 Defensive.  I was pushing for a Ripo/Parry Discilpine with a 5% mitigation increase.<br />

<br />
Cloak of Discord - an upgrade to Cloak of Luclin, good spell.<br />
<br />
Theft of Hate - Group ATK tap - no real upgrade from Aura of Hate<br />
<br />
Touch of Muram - worse resist check than our level 65 tap. Very powerful in non trivial content, but the many lifetap problems still are there.<br />
<br />
Voice of Discord - I personally deemed this set of spells useless with DBoTW/FB warriors with Qvic gauntlets or Time BP.<br />
<br />
Pact of Decay - The exact same spell as our level 64 lich<br />
<br />
Rune of Decay - Pet haste, nice for aggro kite soloing if that will be an option in OoW<br />
<br />
Scythe of Inruku - Undead Nuke, I guess its alright in Inkuta and 2/5 LDoN camps<br />
<br />
Son of Decay - unless they have made a ton of changes, SK pets really only shine in pulls and exp groups where the SK isnt the puller :).<br />
<br />
Spear of Muram - small upgrade from Miasmic Spear.  This set of spells is pretty worthless on raids due to the long recast time and Disease not being one of the resists debuffed<br />
<br />
Blood of Inruku - a 208 base damage tick fast dot.  Either they up the damage by a lot or make this stack with the spell of this line that we get 2 levels below.<br />
<br />
Dark Constriction - I'm glad they added this line of spells back to the game.  If they changed the debuff strength to debuff atk, this spell would be pretty good.<br />
<br />
Shroud of Discord - atm this spell is worse than our level 65 version of it.  This spell costs more mana and adds a 65 damage proc while the 65 version is a 90 damage.  Not to mention Mental Horror smokes them both<br />
<br />
Terror of Discord - they either need to change the spell completely or delete the entire series.  This set of spells has no point.<br />
<br />
Theft of Pain - while not that big of an upgrade to Aura of Pain, its worth memming over Aura of Pain<br />
<br />
Bond of Inruku - I do not know the use for a slow lifetap dot.<br />
<br />
Omen-SK-PH - looks to be an undead nuke, has no spell effect atm<br />
<br />
Touch of Inruku - resist downgrade from our level 65 lifetap.  All the problems with lifetaps still apply.<br />
<br />
Blood of Discord - small upgrade from our level 63 dot.  This dot gets upgraded again at level 68.  Either make it stackable or remove this spell (not the spell line) completely.<br />
<br />
Dark Tendrils - no real upgrade from level 61 snare.  Either up the resist mod (what made festering darkness used over dooming) or give us a new spell.<br />
<br />
The two spells [Inruku's bite and the Ancient] are fantastic spells.  Being able to have 4 zevbites will make us desireable on fights where mana is scarce (Pretty rare these days, but there are some)</div></div><hr />

I can count on one hand the current content I've been fighting where a difference of -500 to -200 actually matters (Zoo in Qvic, that's it).  I guess if you have a habit of trying to land spells on the magic immune giants in PoEB (who are, after all, magic immune), or try to land stuff with crazy resists in LDoN raids (after all these raids are really popular), you might need a -500 MR spell.  Even a measly -100 MR on Static Blow is, for all practical purposes, unresistable.

1. Duel wield - when 2hs is weapon of choice. Also did I mention that you do almost as much dps with insane ration 1h and raise ac with shield.<br />
Warriorization of items <br />

With the new duel wield aa's duel wield is again a better option then 2h weapons.<br />

2.  I dont know how it is in GoD but PoP was all about knight items. So whatever. Also you admit yourself there are many more warriors then sk and pallies.<br />
<br />
I don't know how much of PoP you have seen but only in the plane of time is the gear more or less close.  Ornate and elemental gear for warriors has more ac and hp per item.<br />
<br />
3. Inate mitigation - guess what... It was just recently introduced cause warriors were not measuring up to ... who? hmmm thats right to knights!<br />
<br />
Warriors did not need an increase in mititation they were already had better mitigation then any class.<br />
<br />
4 Dps- WTF are you talking about?!<br />

Warrior dps is far ahead of both knight classes with time and beyond weapons.<br />
<br />
5.  Defensive disks/Offensive disks - guess what pure-meles get discs. OMG! Warriors get situational utilities!!!!<br />
<br />
Unlinking of the discs cause a large imblance.  Warriors now have spells. Tell me incite is not a spell?  It was modeled after the sk terrror line.<br />

Phantron, it was more something that shadowknights have gotten used to that was not overpowering in the PvE environment.  I generally load both lifetaps when tanking or when mobs AE rampage or have a large AE.  Using the -200 one, I net a few resists and a few partials every so often, but nothing too major.  Touch of Innoruuk was a great spell. (rivaling Aura of Pain for the best SK PoP spell) With its insane resist mod, ToI and IHT served as shadowknights burst damage after a combat round.   While I'd rather see the other problems with lifetaps fixed first, this is more an issue of my attachment to this spell than it is the shadowknight community.</div></div><hr />

In eq1, Verant/SoE has NEVER, not for a single day, not since I started playing in beta phase 3 had warriors balanced with knights.  Yet in EQ2 there will be 6 warrior type classes to balance.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u199"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p199">Let's assume for a moment that SKs are not supposed to have quite the AC, hps, or innate mitigation that warriors do, given &quot;the same&quot; level of advancement.<br />
<br />
Posts have been made on this board concerning dps tests across classes and functionally SKs are not outdamaging warriors.<br />
<br />
The other central function of tanks is to hold aggro, of course, and here the SKs do better because, luckily, they have a lvl 15 spell called clinging darkness. SKs can cast a few useful spells in battle, but they hit what I've come to think of as &quot;cascade failure&quot; much much faster than warriors. My SK alt is not at all advanced, but add mobs in experience groups make his spell book considerably less useful, but my warrior's incite line and AC advantage are never &quot;interrupted.&quot;<br />
<br />
when Inferna says the following, I think she's making a point that shouldn't be dismissed out of hand: &quot;The only spells I use when I tank are clinging darkness for aggro, lifetap if a heal is going to be late, snare if the mob is a runner, and the ac tap. So much for the big spell advantage.&quot;<br />
<br />
I still think, given pally stuns &amp; group heals and warrior heavy-damage mitigation advantages and improved aggro/unlinked discs, that the SKs could use some developer lovin. I've argued before that that lovin should *not* come in the form of giving SKs the same sorts of tanking skills that warriors have (e.g., defensive): the more alike the tanking classes are in the way they do their jobs, the more likely it is that one class will be the best tank in all situations, and the other classes will have nothing to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u200"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p200">Yet in EQ2, they are promising no one the 'best of this and that'. Expect to see 5-6 completely interchangeable tanks with only a bit more than stylistic differences.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u201"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p201">Yep. EQ2 is going to be awesome for those that buy it. Just like SW:G was.<br />
<br />
As for me, I'll play EQ until they shut down the last server or WoW turns out to be better, which ever comes first.<br />
<br />
When they killed M:TG by no longer supporting Type 1 tournaments and trying to compete with PokeMon - myself, my three sons, the game store we played at and the rest of the 50 people that played there just dropped MT:G. We didn't take up Portal, PokeMon, or heaven forfend Ugio (sp).<br />
<br />
WoTC went from being powerful enough to buy TSR to being a minor division of Hasbro.<br />
<br />
If I wanted to play a game where no class was fully unique and had superiority in a role, I'd be playing FFXI right now. Leesee Paladin with Warrior sub job (The best raid tank), Warrior with Monk sub job (acceptable group tank with better DPS), or Dark Knight with Samurai sub job (not a tank - dps). Hmmmm, I want to be the best tank, I guess that's Paladin with Warrior sub job. The min/maxers establish which is the best tank quite quickly and they get entrenched in the game  community's mind as The Best from that point forward.<br />
<br />
That kind of thing is why SoE will avoid killing the golden goose. IT's EQ that put them on the on-line gaming map - nothing else.<br />

so an SK with the same weapon does about 85 DPS without procs when warrior does 105.(103 less attack because 25 less skill cap nets that much, both of those guys at capped attack)<br />
<br />
so raw difference is 20dps. Warrior can not boost his output, While SKs can add pet that does roughly 25dps and another 20 with spells and does have attack buffs. In xp groups SK doing more dps then warrior for sure on raids probably not thought. I always was under the impression SKs had a bigger DPS advantage to tell the truth. At least now I know where the fuck you are coming from.<br />
<br />
If you and other SKs went out done some fucking reasearch and came out with facts like this, we could talk. SKs still most definatley have tools to outdps warrior with same level of gear, it does not however happen all the time. Should this be improved? Well as long as it would be SK only change with raising their weapon cap to warrior level I think that would make sense. Since SKs were in my eyes always are suppose to be doing a lil more dps then warrior does. I am totaly against doing this for pallies.</div></div><hr />

SK's have a lot of these same nuking capabilities alongside Tapping for even further dps and a few worthwhile dots.  A good SK who has trained his/her aa's properly should be able to add another 40-80dps depending on resists and crit luck ... this doesnt even count pet dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have to realize that when we are tanking esp in GoD that most of our spell casting is just chaining aggro spells.  Our top spear does 660 damage but this rarely does full damage because its disease based.  So it might be fully resisted or land for 200 or 300 dmage.  Now my weapon is hitting for this much and the spell has a  30 sec recast time so it can be cast once per mob.  So how much of an increase in dps is that?<br />
<br />
Now a lifetap will bring you some dps but its also very mana heavy to use as a nuke but most of us have to do this since our nukes are so bad.<br />
<br />
I dont use a pet when I am tanking in god cause one riposte and its dead.<br />
<br />
I doubt any sk who is tanking can add that much dps by spells.<br />
<br />
Even one who is not tanking would be doing good to add 40 on lower level mobs.<br />
<br />
We currently have only one useful dot.  And we can load two spears if you have the God and Pop one.  But like I said the recast time is long so if you load two and land both for full value your only doing 1260 damage on a non crit.  Since you only crit 10 percnt of the time the crits really are not much of a over all dsp increase.<br />
<br />
Now most of the time the spear will not land for full value and in god it mostly lands if it lands at all for around 200 to 300 damage.</div></div><hr />

Attempt #2 - Cleric attempts a root pull and runs back to the casters.

Attempt #3 - Time is NOT on our side. We must kill at least two immediately. I tell them I will aggro and we'll try the root and fall back trick one more time. The SK logs in.

I have on several ocassions had a Paladin res the Cleric and save a restart on a GoD trial. I've had both a Paladin and an SK finish off mobs when I bit the dust.

Knights have exceptional versatility. In intermediate difficulty content or in a raid they are capable of support Warriors can't even begin to touch. This is including the ability to add tank and offtank while still being able to call upon their spellbook.<br />
<br />
In the very hardest content it's difficult to exceed a Warrior's capability to tank for three minutes. However after that three minutes is up, the Warrior is just like a Knight except he has no spellcasting capability whatsoever. <br />

Warriors are the tank with the unmatched ability to SURVIVE the most brutal battles.<br />
<br />
Knights lack this ability to survive the most brutal battles wether they be 30 second fights or 15 minute fights. What they get instead are spellbooks and versatility.<br />
<br />
It's one thing to give Knights brief emergency &quot;burst mitigation&quot;. It's another thing entirely for that ability to allow them to tank like a Warrior and survive when without that &quot;burst mitigation&quot; ability they wouldn't. That capability is the Warrior class defining ability.<br />

<br />
Why do you keep bringing up these exceptional situtions?<br />
<br />
1. Warrior will rarely group an sk.  If they need a puller they will get a monk.<br />
2. Sk's get groups because they need a tank.  Why is this so hard to understand for you?  We dont get groups because of our dps, or utility.  If there is no warrior available we might get a shot at a GoD group but if there is one then no.<br />
3. If there is no monk around we might get a chance at pulling but this is not why we get groups.<br />
4.  I can also list the amount of times my group was saved because some class had root.  Or some class could FD pull or some class could rez.  Or the times I had a warrior to tank some boss that killed me in 2 secs.<br />
<br />
Your argument bears no weight.  Maybe you are willing to group knights but no one else will take us unless we can tank the content at a good level of success.</div></div><hr />

The content was supposed to be balanced to make knights viable tanks and your saying we should not be tanks at all that we should be backing up our main man the warrior in single group content?<br />
<br />
Brenlo has stated that the content will be adjusted so that the holy trinity is not needed.<br />
<br />
Wait and see what this does and we can move on from there.  As an aside, this is not the same thing that I asked about in a thread a few weeks back.  That had to do with scaling single group encounters to allow for different trials depending on who was tanking.  It was to that idea that we recieved a resounding no, and we listened.  The current plan is not to allow the content to scale (thus, using your words for it, gimping the content for Knights) rather we are adjusting all of the content.  <br />
Look, the Gates content is just too hard. Even warriors need two healers on them to make it work.  That is not the way it was intended.  Let's sit back, take a deep breath and see what this does.  If it does what we hope, it will remove the imbalance present for tanks in Gates AND allow for more variety in groups.  No longer will the &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; be necessary to perform well in those zones!<br />

If its part of single group content or part of a single group progression trial then we sure do have a right to be able to tank it<br />

Just because a warrior can tank better does not mean they should dominate the single group tanking role.<br />
<br />
You can sit there and think its all balanced now because Knights can't get groups in GoD and warriors can, but this is NOT balance.  Just like how warriors complained in POP that they could not get groups the same thing is now happening to Knights.<br />

Spell book does not equal defensive.  I have already posted what we have given up for our spell books if you want to read up in the thread abit and it is quite a bit.<br />
<br />
Our spell book does little for our tanking.  So little that if you read up you will also see the amount of spells I use when I tank.  This list is less then the benefits that warriors get from their disks let alone the extra hp ac and mitigation and dps they already enjoy.<br />

Your so off topic.  Who cares if some sub 9500 hp paladin has friends that group him every day.  I can tank in KT too.   What I am talking about is the problem of SK and Knights not not being chosen for groups unless a Warrior is not around for GoD content.<br />
<br />
We all need a chance to get groups.  As I have stated before warriors cried and whined their eyes out during pop until they got over compensated with spells to compete with Knight aggro.  They were also give hp and mitigation upgrades that were unneeded and the unlinking of discs.<br />
<br />
Now the shoe is in the other foot and Knight classes are the ones that cannot get groups.<br />
<br />
Yet every warrior thinks this is the most balanced the tanks have ever been !<br />
<br />
This is great.   Talk about being selfish and self servering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u218"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p218">Nice nice try.<br />
......to compete with Knight aggro.<br />
Warrior Class Description<br />
Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.<br />
Patch message January 20, 2000<br />
The taunt skill was increased because SKs, and in particular, Paladins had difficulty taunting opponents off of Rangers, Monks, Rogues, and Warriors due to their lower damage output. Though the Paladin and SK will never equal the warrior in their ability to taunt, this change in addition to some of the taunting spells  should help them become more effective tanks.<br />
SoE was sent quite a bit of evidence that the Warrior ability to taunt [Verant apparenty used the word taunt [to wit &quot;taunting spells&quot;] as a synonym for acquire aggro) was not consistant with earlier statements nor the class description.<br />
They were also give hp and mitigation upgrades that were unneeded and the unlinking of discs.<br />
In an interview (can't seem to find the link atm, maybe someone could provide it?), an SoE representative described the changes in the Phase 1 Melee Update as &quot;needed&quot;. The includes aggro changes, &quot;-1 DI&quot;, and unlinked disciplines.<br />
<br />
I'm so sorry that you disagree with SoE and insist that the Warrior changes were uneeded.<br />
Now the shoe is in the other foot and Knight classes are the ones that cannot get groups.<br />
!!!!<br />
You dare to compare &quot;needed&quot; changes to Warriors to address class balance issues to a content design issue that has been identified as such and has been addressed by revising content?<br />
!!!!<br />
Brenlo described the problems in GoD in great detail and let us know that some content was designed for level 70 players. This content as you well know has been revised, in fact it's been revised a couple of times.<br />
<br />
You claim some individually required flags in single group content are inappropriately difficult? Call them to the attention of SoE.<br />
<br />
You claim some open zone mobs, like Kyvv Heartstriker which was modified btw, still hit inappropriately hard? Call them to the attention of SoE.<br />
<br />
You make the boldfaced claim Knights can't get groups in GoD??!!! By all means, call any other misadjustments to content to SoE's attention. I'm certain they would want to fix anything they may have overlooked when they adjusted GoD content.<br />
<br />
I think I'm all done with you. You misrepresented why Warriors and other got the Melee Phase 1 Update and stated it was not needed. You attempted to equate &quot;needed&quot; (in SoE's words) class balance changes to acknowledged encounter design issues and suggest that not only had the encounters not been fixed (they have), whined about them here rather than calling them to SoE's attention for further adjustment, and then tried to use alleged still existing content design issues as justification for an unwarranted grab of a defining Warrior Class Ability.<br />
<br />
Oh, I'm all in favor of Knights getting a 12 second/half hour refresh autoparry discipline if needed to enhance their survivability at first contact with exceptional mobs - that's reasonable. But not &quot;burst mitigation&quot; used to survive MTing a brutal battle where they would other wise fail - that's the Warrior class defining ability.<br />
<br />
Like it or not Warriors will always tank better than Pallies and SK's. This will be most evident when they use disciplines to survive tanking a brutal mob. This ability to increase their survivability when tanking brutal mobs is Warrior class defining and should not be shared with Knights.<br />
<br />
When not using Defensive (normal experiance groups and tanking normal adds), the inate difference in AC and HP's between Warirors and Knights is not great and more than made up by spellboks. If you allege SK spellbooks need improvement in this area, don't fail to call that to SoE's attention either.<br />
<br />
BTW, in three months of watching /who all lfg 65 on a regular basis, I've yet to see any Knight in Barindu or Kod'taz /lfg. In fact I've seldom seen a 65 Knight /lfa except this one player in obviously pathetic gear. Hmmm.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u219"><b>Scal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p219">The common belief is that Warriors should be better at tanking, while the Knights add more with utility.  That is pretty much the argument there, should Knights be balanced by utility [spellbook], while leaving their primary role to suck? While it is debatable over the boards, keep in mind that groups do not care much for utility. Are you going to chose a druid as the primary healer because of the druid's utility? Odds are if you even have a druid in the group, the druid is the secondary healer.  The reason Druids aren't up in arms about Clerics? Healing stacks, Tanking does not.<br />
<br />
Unless the shadowknight class takes a 180degree turn into new definition, We need some sort of a spell or discipline that helps us compete with the TANKS for six man content. While this could come from the spellbook, it needs to be something that allows us to push a button for instant burst damage mitigation.<br />
<br />
What I suggest. (Keep in mind I play an SK, so I do not know what paladins need)<br />
<br />
1) Give Shadowknights and Paladins a 12second/30minute autoparry/riposte discipline. This allows Knights to tank over rangers when the warriors parish.<br />
<br />
2)Rework the Spear series OR the Terror series to tie in a 4second stun with a 18 second recast.  Naturally Spears would require a -40 or so resist mod if spears were given the stun effect. This gives shadowknights the spell to compete with Paladin stuns all while fixing our aggro problems now and in the future.<br />
<br />
3)Bump Knight mitigation up 5%. This brings Knight mitigation between Warriors and light tanks by a different method than AC<br />
<br />
4) This one is not really important, but I don't see the harm in it with Knight itemization anymore.  Up Paladin offensive skills to 235. Up Shadowknight offensive skills to 245.<br />
<br />
Then again, all this will work in GoD.  I'm not sure what OoW will bring content wise.</div></div><hr />

Well very few people sit in KT lfg.  But when I zone in KT and do a /who I often see only one or two knights and many times I am the only one.<br />

Anyway I am done with KT there is nothing left for me there but to farm more 35 hp augs.  My as's are maxed so i am only interested in content that can provide upgrades at this point which is the Ikkiniz single group trials where again Knights have an even more difficult time finding groups.<br />
<br />
I have only been in one farming run only because no warriors were online at the time and I tanked the named that drops the ring (the ring didnt drop and earring did.)  We had one cleric and a shaman and we won I didn't die but my DI did fire.<br />
<br />
Anyway I have taken the boards advice and I am re-rolling as a warrior since I have lost all interest in the SK class due to the changes that SoE has made.<br />

I am re-rolling as a warrior<br />
 ... <br />
I have found the warrior to be a very easy class to play and very powerful I have no complaints about it at all. <br />

I knew you won't been able to left us, we have hooked you my dear :) welcome home young warrioress !<br />

... but you might be disapointed again by your new toon one day ... I hope not, but I still thinks so because this shity spellbook is hard to get ride of that quickly (except if it has been under used) ...</div></div><hr />

I got my sow and invis potions and right now that seems to be all the utility I need.  I fact with the regen changes I am soloing while LFG and it seems productive, although I am limited to areas in which the mobs don't run to far or too fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u229"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p229">Bleh, this thread keeps going places I don't think are productive.<br />
<br />
When I said SKs are not &quot;functionally&quot; out-damaging warriors I guess I really meant is that it seems unlikely that an SK is going to be mistaken for a dps class any more than warriors get groups because of their dps. But my point was that dps is a pretty minor matter for a tank, whether you are talking single group or offtanking.<br />
<br />
For reasons much like those BB pointed out in his post about the SK who managed a mission-saving pull, I really like to group with SKs too. My SK is pretty happy grouping with a warrior, too--it just rarely occurs that a group will eagerly take an SK if they have a warrior and access to any non-SK pulling class.<br />
<br />
BB did say something that might produce a productive line of conversation:<br />
 &quot;Oh, I'm all in favor of Knights getting a 12 second/half hour refresh autoparry discipline if needed to enhance their survivability at first contact with exceptional mobs - that's reasonable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, I think the needs of SKs vary from those of Paladins, but SKs could use some sort of something when they really need to survive long enough for the rest of the group to organize for support. The exact details of autoparry coudl be fiddled with, and it might not be the only lovin' SKs could use, but I fail to see how giving SKs some sort of burst mitigation for &quot;offtanking gone wrong&quot; moments would eliminate warriors' tanking roles.<br />
<br />
There's obviously an unease (which I share) among warriors who contemplate either class of knights doing what we do the same way we do it. but really, if an SK is going to be a good offtank he can't just be dead in a few seconds everytime two or three serious but non-boss mobs need to be picked up at once. At some point, of course, when mobs are too tough, all tanks should die. But SKs should have a trick up their sleeve that allows the rest of the group to take some sort of action. And, sometimes, that trick should save them and their healers.<br />
<br />
There is a cascade failure problem for SKs when attempting to cast spells while being hit by multiple mobs. This can also be a problem for SK FD on nasty pulls. You have this odd potential result where a random blue mob is absurdly easy for an SK to tank using a couple casts of a lvl 15 spell and periodic lifetaps; but if a friend or two joins the mob, the SK is apt to be unable to use his spellbook at exactly the time he needs it. I realize that most abilities that all classes have come with drawbacks/limitations, but usually the players at least have the option to use the ability when they need it.<br />
<br />
If mobs now have more room for debuffs, it certainly seems to me that SK utility could be increased through that means. Obviously this does not make them better tanks, but it would increase utility and it seems like there would be a way to do it that would be useful but not game breaking.</div></div><hr />

May I humbly suggest that you get a Polished Obsidian Greataxe, Silken Whip of Ensnaring, and Black Acrylia Two Handed Sword with a Black Diamond of Regeneration (Vampire Kiss) augment. Fear kiting solo or with a Necro or SK partner (assuming you can find one to group with - they can solo and really really don't need you) is continuous low risk experiance starting in front of Karnor's Castle in your upper 40's straight though to Maiden's Eye at level 65. It should cut the time needed to level from 48 to 65 in half allowing you to start on your AA's as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
Also be sure to acquire a ToD, it's the true Warrior Epic. Oh, and an Embalmer's Skinning Knife to minimize down time.<br />
<br />
If you are going to play a Warrior, you'll find playing a very poor imitation of a hybrid melee/spellcaster is often the only thing that tranforms you from a Knight Without a Spellbook into a barely viable class.<br />

  Thanks for the suggestion.  A ToD would rock.  The prices have gone out of sight lately.  Wonder how rare they are to get if I camped it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u232"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p232">Rarity is the same ... Seb is just never camped any more so the number of new ToD's entering the market is rather low.<br />
<br />
Mostly, it is just dumb shits in the baz inflating prices</div></div><hr />

<br />
picked up a ToD just the other day for 16.5k.<br />
<br />
Not too high, IMO, just gotta watch the bazaar for deals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u234"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p234">Nice ... on my server they jumped from 6-10k to 60k overnight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u235"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p235">Hehe, just goes to show you what enterprising Bazaar hound can make money at. Not that that is a bad thing...</div></div><hr />

They are like 80K on CT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u237"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p237">Interesting Chart I noticed that the GoD cleric armor and sk armor has identical HP and AC.<br />
<br />
<br />
that's why we (not we warrior, but we EQ players) asked SoE to retune the GoD armor (especially breastplate and legs) to make it with more sense.<br />
for exemple, warrior don't care about Cleave, it does nothing for aggro. and since their are focus, the one (DPS melee) that take the cleave3 earring will screw his top end breastplate power (ie diferentiation with multiclass items).<br />
Warrior would prefer replace the cleave effect with a ripost focus.<br />
and so on ...<br />
<br />
<br />
but brenlo respond ... &quot;maybe after OoW&quot;</div></div><hr />
