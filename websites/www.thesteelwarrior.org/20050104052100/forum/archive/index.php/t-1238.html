<br />
i need a good haste item, atm i have the sash of the dragonborn and i want something around 30 to 50 haste that i can attain with a guild that has 20 people in the 52 58 range (no thurg stuff tho, we need that faction :(  ) what shall i go after? anything but these damn vox raids were RBB almost never drop or raids on naggy were the clerics dont come because nothing drops for them half the time (GG verant/SoE) plus staying at 52 sucks, im falling behind my guild</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO your best options will be the weaker Kunark/Velious dragons.  Talendor (skyfire), KD? (in Cobalt Scar), Sev (in Emerald Jungle).  I think each of these have a chance at dropping a haste cloak or belt that is 31, 34, or 36%.  And, as far as I know 41% haste is the highest item haste equipable by warriors.  I don't know what your guild make up is, but 20 peeps 52-58 don't have a lot of options for this type of item, especially without a lvl 60 MT.<br />
<br />
I got my RBB from killing Gore in DL which maybe you all could do but I wouldn't count on it.  The AE fear I think would make your raid quite interesting at those levels.  The cloak I wear now is from Zlandicar in DN (you get a drop that you hand in for it, anyway).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">06-14-2003, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmmm, that sounds possible, thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">06-14-2003, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Level.  You can deal with 24% haste for a while until you're 60 and you can tank more of the Kunark Dragons.  Don't forget felspine in SG, drops a 34% haste belt.  He can be farmed as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">06-14-2003, 08:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sev's probably your best shot at a haste upgrade.<br />
<br />
He's up more often than Doomshade, and is much easier. If your guild isn't really experienced with Kael raiding, I think Doom would wreck you.<br />
<br />
Or, you can go for a cloak of the crystaline waters. Place a spotter in CS and wait for the dragon to pop. That'd be something fun to try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so should i lead my raid to death or just keep leveling? not to sure now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolveren</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 07:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure if ya could handle Junkbeast in PoInnovation, drops a 34% haste belt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">junkbeast? maybe to sum it up here is our raid power<br />
a group and a half we took out phinny, towro frostquake, <br />
<br />
With 2 groups we handled 3 protectors of zek and 2 normal giant adds(all at once) , we handled the 4 waves of the ring war throne room.<br />
<br />
we also are blessed with a blood thursty 65 shaman who will go on any raid :D<br />
<br />
i am factory flagged so if its in there i can open the place up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sturgis</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 08:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spawned Ragefire still may drop Cloak of Flames, last I checked. We've gotten a couple of them while doing noodles. He's pretty easy for one group of 60+, so your guild shouldnt have much trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 08:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">not many will have a good haste item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Macnair</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Felspin in SG can be done with a couple groups in your level range and his belt is about as nice as it gets for the effort put into it.  First off it should put you close to max haste for your level (with a nice speed buff) and second the stats rock for a tank...<br />
<br />
Spiked Seahorse Hide Belt <br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM  <br />
AC: +10 Str: +4 Sta: +4 Agi: +4 Dex: +4 Wis: +4 Int: +4 Cha: +4 Magic Resist: +1 Fire Resist: +1 Cold Resist: +1 Poison Resist: +1 Disease Resist: +1 HP: +25 Mana: +25  <br />
 <br />
Serin's grotto is almost always empty on my server and you should get a few chances at the belt in one night.  So maybe you can get a few extra for guild funds or other tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 11:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ummm.. zlandicar is gimp when slowed, drops cowl of mortality as well as frakadar's talisman for shroud of the dar brood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 08:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe im confused, i dont know the abrevs for most of the mobs being thrown around :) but ill look into it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 09:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sev = Severilious in Emerald Jungle. For the warrior epic. Drops Runed Bolster Belt<br />
<br />
Rage = Ragefire, now triggered in Skyfire Mountains. ULTRA RARELY drops the old nagafen loot table, including a cloak of flames. I've killed him five times haven't gotten anything other than Fennin Ro armor.<br />
<br />
KD = Kelorek'Dar is in Cobalt Scar. Drops Cloak of Crystaline Waters. I had forgotten his name earlier.<br />
<br />
Junkbeast = Junkbeast, from Plane of Innovation.<br />
<br />
Zlandi = Zlandicar, from Dragon Necropolis. Drops the cowl of mortality, as well as a talisman for the shroud of the dar brood quest.<br />
<br />
Felspine = the annoying camp in Siren's Grotto. I'm biased. I pretty much hate everything about Siren's Grotto, so I pretend the zone has no loot. It makes me a happier player. Your mileage will probably vary here.<br />
<br />
Gore = Gorenaire, from Dreadlands, who drops RBB.<br />
<br />
Talendor = Talendor from Skyfire Mountains. He has Nagafen's loot table.<br />
<br />
If you all are doing HoT ... you can always try and see how you do on Dozekar. Completing the platinum tear quest thingie nets you the Silver Bracelet of Speed. That will end your haste worries for a long time to come.<br />
<br />
But obviously, Dozekar is no slouch. And he's hard to catch up on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 01:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They are raiding Thurg arena, with pretty much the hardest thing fought being a PoZ (protector of zek), so its doubtful you will be able to take the Kunark dragons, not pre 60, with 20ish, without top end gear, Dragon fear would keep you all running till they ate you for lunch.<br />
<br />
Best thing at your level you'll be able to come across without killing yourself and your raid numerous times, would prolly be an RBB, or a Sib Cloak (they are single group drops in Seb).  But other than that, Vox/Naggy will be your best bet.<br />
<br />
DB Sash should be more than effective at your level though, im assuming 52, as your still killing Vox/Naggy.  <br />
<br />
Get a few levels under ya, then worry bout better gear, 60 should be your main concern atm, then worry bout other things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 09:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok thanks guys this has been much help</div></div><hr />
