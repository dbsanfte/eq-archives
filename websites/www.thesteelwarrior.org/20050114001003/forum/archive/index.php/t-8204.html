<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grobie</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 02:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some tips:<br />
<br />
1) switch the weapons around 12/20 &gt; 11/19 - you may get a bit more DPS aggro through that.<br />
2) Get some DEX. If you do LDONs grab those augs that drop and plug them into your free armour slots - can always replace / remove them later if your overall armour gets better,<br />
3) I dont know what your guild / your friends are capable of killing, but one point might be to replace your 27% haste with something of higher haste. Soulscream Belt maybe (31%) or even dragon haste (CoF / CoCW etc) (36%)<br />
4) You could save up for Anger2 or Ykesha proc augs from LDON<br />
<br />
If you level up til 55 and your guild can kill tinker dragon, you can get 2 serious upgrades from theer (haste neck and taunt hammer - which both will do wonders to you, I think)<br />
<br />
Other than that: bonk your groupmates to not make your job so hard by nuking early and hard etc. Wait a sec more with tash and slow etc.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps a bit</div></div><hr />

Either you really have annoyed the RNG lately or you are grouping with some folks that just keep aggro themselves. If you see a BST or a RNG with a CHoS don't expect do hold aggro over them that easy. Just watch your group for a while and check who is getting aggro and try to find out why. Even if you use Provoke ability and have aggro weapons equiped you still depend on your group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye, rangers and beasts tend to use the Droga weapons frequently and can be a pain for keeping aggro for many levels to come.<br />
<br />
Aside from the above suggestions, you're just gonna hafta hit taunt ALOT.<br />
<br />
Don't be afraid to tell them to bag the aggro weapons either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Squizer</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">long ago, you wouldn't be able to taunt any kind of mob above your lvl till you hit 60 ( and well, it worked before 50 though).<br />
<br />
I mean, a lvl 56 mob when you are 55 would barely listen to your taunts, so you would have rely on dps/proc aggro and you're more likely to have some other class overaggroing easily..<br />
<br />
questions being: <br />
- are you hunting yellow or red cons ?<br />
- is that &quot;taunt nerf&quot; still live... ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ssuruss</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you using your taunt CA skill? Bellow, incite, or whichever one you have at your lvl? If you don't have it or aren't using it bonk yourself and correct it. There are going to be those groups where you have someone who will overagro, like the monk who thinks his SoD and CHOS is uber DPS and he shouldn't bag them for a 2hnder, but if you are constnatly having agro issues with those weapons I'm more inclined to think your missing something. Are you hitting tuant as soon as the mob is at camp? Tossing an arrow or two at it while it's incomming? Those little things add up, esspecially when you have a suicidal shammy that thinks he can tank if he pulls agro with slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those things proccin for you?Way better than I had,but, you need your dex up at that level to make a proccer work well for you from memory.Around 200 dex I remember a noticable practical differance in aggro apart from the proc calculations we use here.I assume they proc despite your level,or, someone woulda mentioned that.<br />
<br />
On incoming hold your first taunt and possibly your incite type disc until after debuff and stand close to the slower/debuffer.When slow comes in,or, your first ch if you have to taunt and aggro disc.Depending on your group you can aggro disc before debuff and hold it possibly.After debuff you can make your turn and position the mob.Stay close to the mob and encourage others to back up to max melee.If you see him twitch at someone else he may only be casting ,but, taunt if there's any doubt.<br />
<br />
Yeah,I can taunt red cons now for mez breaks quite cleary.Only problem is a horrid success rate.Raid can't usually stand around while I taunt 8 times hehe so I often break hoping another tank has had a succesful taunt.Higher the con harder the taunt.<br />
<br />
Just remember that on all xp mobs that die fast warriors hold aggro at the will of their group.You gotta do your best to mitigate it ,but,if a caster wants aggro he'll usually get it. :)</div></div><hr />

Adding the augments will get rid of 99% of your problems ... WA5 on top of that will make you an aggro god.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Much depends on where you are fighting and what your group is doing. Also, it would perhaps be helpful to know who you are losing aggro to, and at what point in the fight.<br />
I can tell you one thing: if you're at level 53 and you have a couple of rangers in your group who are swinging ChoS the mob will look like a ping pong ball bouncing from flipper to flipper.<br />
If you are in an LDoN, try to be the puller if you can--any situation where singles are possible, try to be the first person in your group to do melee damage. If that's not possible, position yourself where you can tag the mob with an arrow before other melee start whacking it. Ask the puller to pull the mob right to you; I think you get a slight aggro edge if you can land a round of melee before you use the incite line, and you'll have an easier time of it if you're not running across the dungeon to get in range of the mob.<br />
If one group member is ganking your aggro prepeatedly, set up this hotkey: /shield ganker'sname. Shield him and you might get aggro back.<br />
Long term: work on saving points for anger augs, try to increase your DEX, and consider Weapon Affinity AAs when you can get them.<br />
And just grit your teeth and try to be an otherwise cheerful groupmember. In some ways the 50s game is rough on warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">a well timed taunt can usually keep agro for you the whole fight. i usually watch the spell spam and wait for the slower to start casting, then i get ready to taunt the second i see &quot;mob_01 yawns&quot; or &quot;mob_01 slows down&quot;. <br />
also, i use arrows on incoming as often as i can, followed by bellow the second the mob is in melee range.<br />
<br />
i do agree with whats mentioned above, at your lvl, if some one doesnt want you to have agro, or isnt smart enough to know how to keep their agro down you probably wont get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tyrrarius</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I liked the Frostbringer at that level. The proc seems to hold real solid agro and proc a nice amount of time.</div></div><hr />

Improve haste if possible. Soulscream belt would be nice<br />
Dex was covered, Yak/Anger augs covered, WA covered...<br />
<br />
If you call assist, add a second to aggro generation before calling it till you maintain a decent hold.<br />
<br />
Who do you currently group with?<br />
Sometimes you can proc all to high hell on a mob with others offtanking and then when they get to your mob suddenly and without warning, the mob jumps to a ranger/warrior/paladin for no apparent reason. It is not uncommon to have for whatever reason, someone taunt the mob off you.<br />
<br />
I tend to believe the problem is more with your groups lack of experiance than you.<br />
If I could hold mediocre aggro with a Frosty/LSoEE at your level your weapons are more than suffecient.</div></div><hr />

I generally use Provoke and then beat on/position the mob THEN call assist.  I usually have no problems with agro that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuthbadth</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 09:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't underestimate the advantage of a few arrows when pulling or on incoming with a good bow, I can get two shots off of 100-200 damage total on average.<br />
<br />
Additionally, don't hit Incite before Taunt.  I originally did this as I read incite to be a hate dot and I figured the sooner I fire incite the sooner I'll have more agro.  However, as I read somewhere on board, hitting taunt as soon as mob is in camp and then hitting incite will hopefully put you on top of the hate list + the amount of hate caused by incite initially and then you can turn on your auto attack to ramp up as quick as possible and stay on top of agro list.<br />
<br />
It also depends on what class you're losing agro to, it's quite common to have agro issues with beastlords or slowers that need to adjust how soon the slow based on how quickly their tank generates agro.  Also, if you are not level 65 yet, you'll find that the AA mentioned above, in addition to casters getting AA in Spell Casting Subtlety will help.<br />
<br />
Without a doubt, if you can do LDoN's at a reasonable point rate (i.e., 51 points for a normal win @ 65 and 105 for a hard) get some sort of proc augments for your weapons.  Anger 2/3 or Ykesha if possible, but even a small dd augment for 50 points is better than nothing (just don't expect as big an improvement).</div></div><hr />

<br />
but yeah, low 50's are hell to a warrior. just keep pluging away and when all else fails; sacrifice some gnomes to the RNG god. He likes gnomes; especially with mustard and relish,</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'm surprised that my Fabled executioner's Axe holds agro as well as it does.  Not sure if its the Haste proc or the high damage, but it seems to hold agro as well as my DW setup.</div></div><hr />

some suggestions, your cobalt gear is good AC but bad for stats. the effects on them are decent-nice but most use them for soloing or when no one to buff a certain stat. the low AGI/DEX might have a small part to do with low DMG on windblade due to not many crits(DEX). Agro might be lost due to low DEX and lack of a few more procs. with my wife's ranger i sometimes have to work on holding agro when she uses CHoS or SoTBS(mostly a skill raiser, she uses nonstun proc weps or bow in a real group). we trio with a druid for grinding AA. she is very good at taking more agro then wanted with a stun procing wep. including Warriors, Paladins, and Shadow Knights. PRAISE to SoE for Jolt (-500 agro)!</div></div><hr />

chos procs at 50 and sotb procs somewhere in the high 30s, so they're procing at the same rate as frosty.</div></div><hr />
