<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So far there have  been a raid of 24 to 30 of us exploring these 2 zones.. We are having trouble on the Mobs that spilt  any advise on how to keep them under control both times we had just 2 chanters so keep that in mind.. Im just wandering is there something that we are missing or not thinking about correctly.. We wen to kill the BIG gator in POE last nite and we had problems at the temple with the ones that split as soon as they died most of the time they would gang up on me or the SA any tips would be nice..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm seriously debating whether this is an honest question or if I should delete it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>vova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This feels like a troll. How can you not know how to deal with adds on splitting mobs if you earned access to PoE?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, I have acess to POE,POA,POW, and i have dame well earned i was just tring to keep it simple and be nice, I guess i was wrong im the type of person that reads and reads i have a thrust to know all that i can before hand.. I Guess i choose the wrong place to do it.. Ubaness sometimes goes the head, However I will always remain humble...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Injektilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You might want to start by amassing a force larger then 24 people if you plan on killing anything in Plane of Earth and Plane of Air.  <br />
<br />
As for the splitters, i assume you are referring to the Armadillo's?  The splits that come off of them are green, they really shouldnt give you any trouble.  We usually just have our monks and rangers solo them while the majority of people stay on the mob the warriors called assist on.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The splits are greens Slammer, off exp-group mobs. Try ae mez's if they're really giving you that much trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kildace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They are actually light blue, and I kill dillos in exp groups, I don't know how they could give you any trouble except if you kill 10 armadillos at the same time ...</div></div><hr />

What this post actually showed was the decline of Everquest. In your little retarded opener, you demonstrated for us all just how far this game has sunk. That you could actually gain access to elemental planes and then pose an almost impossibly stupid question with a straight face - it's disheartening to say the least. In previous years I could rest easy knowing people like you were occupied exping in LoIo, Dreadlands, and Velketors OR pulling off trade window scams to the 'special children' of the EQ world (i.e. your relatives).<br />
<br />
Blind chimpanzees slamming their keyboards with their own testicles could probably figure out how to deal with 'spiltters' before your brain could concoct a plan. That's my final answer.<br />
<br />
This section of the Steel Warrior needs to go back to private. At least then, mind numbing shit like this would be kept out....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ainmer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">While I agree that gay questions like these need to be kept out of this forum, the downside to privacy is privacy.  What I mean by that is no activity.  When this forum was private it was very low traffic, and pretty useless.<br />
<br />
Mods probably just need to become a little more strict on the moderation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It wasn't given enough time to settle. The board had just transferred from EZCrap and whatnot. Within a month it would have had decent traffic from the high end warriors of the EQ Community.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kildace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I agree with Ainmer for a change.<br />
<br />
This forum was all but dead when it was private.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">LOL.. No im not talking about the dillos those are easy and can be DCed easy. If u enter the POE and move to the south there is a temple with a huge croc in it.. Yes i im sure that it will take more than 24 to do this there is 52 of us flagged for the elements..<br />
<br />

No flaming here. Consider this your warning.</div></div><hr />

They mobs i am talking about look like Mages earth pets..  <br />
<br />
You've surpassed outright stupidity junior. You have left mentally handicapped status in the dust. You are brain dead, toe up - DOA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Why do u say that all your tring to do is act like you are better than me..Im sure u put you put your pants on the same way i do each and every day, and log into EQ the way everyone else does, I simply asked for some info not to be poke and made fun of..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Dame Year Highley effluent top of the line years only known to the imaginary BIG crocs with no names(refer here)<br />
<br />
i knew the name of the mobs i would say so.. They mobs i am talking about look like Mages earth pets..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">So, you did RZtW successfully and now you are having problems with a few extra mobs in PoE?<br />
<br />
Furor isn't better than you Slammer.  We are all created equal.  However, Furor is probably one of the most skilled, most diligent, most knowledgeable warriors in the game.  If you want to choose somebody to mess with, mess with somebody much easier... like any other warrior practically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm moving this to the outhouse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You may be right there, But i guess i see things different than he does, If someone came to me with these questions i would gladly give them tips and starts on how to become better and succeed its what we are all here for and play EQ..Im the type of person that if some lowbies needed a tank for the dame trials if i was not busy i would coach them and help the reach there goals there are WAY to many people out there that are not like this and look down on peps i choose not to be one of them, I read the forum and chose to post here hoping to get help is all, Yes im sure when in 7 to 10 days we will have them POE down just like we kick RZ azz every time he spawns and we are around..again I just asked for tips and i thought this was the place to post it.. THERE has got to be people that are reading this and can SEE my point of view.. If there is post it ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">yup I see point... the view isnt all that fucking great thought<br />
now stop fucking around and pissing ppl off or you need to buy a helmet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">haha.. I by no means was tring to do that.. I just asked a question and got an reply that was not cool. Would have been much easier to say.. Sorry find out for yourself or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Two questions (not trying to be mean):<br />
<br />
1.  Is English your first language?<br />
2.  Do you edit your post before posting?<br />
<br />
(Expecting no, no)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Why does that matter, If u can understand what i am typing.<br />
If u cant then im sorry .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">It is very hard to read.  With the spelling and grammatical errors, it is easy for people to dismiss your posts quickly than if you work to make your posts more eloquent and correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Thanks, I will try harder.To slow down and instead of typing of what comes to my mind. I will think review and submit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Hulanta arfe you an english teacher or just a grammer Nazi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I am an EX- English teacher AND a grammar Nazi.  If people want to be understood they need to be careful with their words!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">&lt;---has had Hulanta Grammer Nazi her!!! <br />
<br />
I like it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Lol ....<br />
<br />
He asked about &quot;A dusty warder&quot; I bet.<br />
<br />
Thats one of the tougher ring events in the zone and you need a huge CC crew and a decent tank mez crew I guess, my guild havent had the best luck with it so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">BINGO!!!!! thats it thanks for clearing that up, I could not for the life in me remember those dame things names..I those things are such a pain in the ass..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Off-topic but,<br />
<br />
Furor having &quot;knows warriors are superior&quot; under his name just seems odd to me.<br />
<br />
On-topic.<br />
<br />
I'm glad you got someone to understand the question you were asking. I always look at asking for advice like this:<br />
<br />
If your going to ask someone to go out of their way to help you, you should atleast go out of your way to make the request readable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Mud ring splits as well, but soil is the most difficult of the 4 in my opinion, we cleared all but soil first try, but that one took a bit of learning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Ceny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Its not that you asked how to handle a mob that bugs people, it's how you worded it.  The way you posed this question and your question about Bertoxx, you were very vague and it seemed that you were looking for a detailed step by step spoiler on the  encounter before you made any serious attempts to beat it or figure it out.  Describing your problem specifically, including how the mob acted and how you or your raid party reacted, and the result on the mob...and then asking for feedback/suggestions would net you an answer that might be more to your liking.<br />
<br />
<br />
*edit: bleh, I cant spell*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">English mother fucker, do you speak it??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Got all of that worked out this weekend..$$..Yes i speak english, You piece SHIT..To even think that your are human..HAHA way wrong maybe if your lucky ill let u eat out your sister again...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Such an educated rejoinder :p<br />
<br />
P.s. Believe you wanted to call Fulorian a piece OF shit /shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
2 things:<br />
<br />
1) The person was quoting a MOVIE. Perhaps you've seen it, perhaps not. It's Pulp Fiction. Funny film. Pretty abrasive language, but after reading the above quote, I'm sure you'll be fine watching it and not offended by anything there.<br />
<br />
2) Cleaning up your grammar would help cut down on some of the flames you're receiving. Sometimes it's very hard to understand what it is you're trying to convey. (Oh and it's DAMN, not DAME ...  that one was really starting to get odd to read).<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
Think of it THIS way ...<br />
<br />
Damn the man<br />
<br />
Dame Edna IS a man<br />
<br />
;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>aakla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Actualy I thought he was having trouble handling the baby dillos from reading his first post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Well i have learned many things about posting on this board.<br />
1.  Be detailed about what i am trying to say.<br />
2. I am really better off just finding out things on my own.<br />
3. Just learn to ignore people that try to bash you and think you <br />
    are stupid.<br />
4. This is grammar shcool..<br />
 So now lets close this post and let this post fade away. I have done some checking and i now know who Furor is. This still did not give him a reason to say what he did. I know that im not the brightest person in the world nor do i claim to be. From now on i think ill just read here instead of posting my questions.<br />
<br />
On a ending note its just a game...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>aakla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">5&gt; NEVER, EVER say &quot;let this post fade away&quot; now your going to have people bumping it every day for like a month.<br />
