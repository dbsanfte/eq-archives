CF level 3 is right about 5.43% at level 65 with all melee stats at 305 - thats based off a solid sample set of 15,000 hits, so any variance would be negligble.<br />
<br />
CA is a direct, measurable increase to the % of missed attacks from a mob, I did extensive testing with ST golems back when I got it - it does not affect special defences, ie block,dodge, etc, but does directly increase the miss% of a mob... Preliminary testing shows LR to be 1% per level, will post conclusive results once I build up a large enough sample set</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xagula</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 05:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got this newb question about filling up my general aa after run3. Noone is talking about that, some people mention regen3. But what about the Innate STR/STA... Whats the catch with that? Just wondering since my lill warlady turned 61 now and I am planning on doing some AAs for a change.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am not up to big adventures, havent seen much of the old zones since i am quite an eq newb. I am mostly grouping with guildies and RL friends, so i havent had any troubles yet with not finding a group as a low lvl war. And most of the time I have a healer around (RL partner=63 druid)<br />
<br />
So in this case, isnt getting additional stats (I am a bit low on STA) more valuable than a better regen rate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorthag</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not really.....if your STA is still under 255 unbuffed, you're looking at 18 extra hp...vs regenning an extra 30 hp per minute.. over 255 STA, you're looking at 9 extra hp...and if this going to be a long term character, eventually you'll look at those points spent on stats as wasted points when all your melee stats are capped at 305 buffed...then unbuffed, while regen never becomes useless, it just becomes less noticable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The advantage that CA has over CS as others have mentioned is that you can't mitigate a proc. So with CA you'll take 10% less damage due to misses and be affected by 10% less procs. With CS you'll take 10% less damage due to mitigation but you'll still get hit with the full effect of all procs because you were still hit the same number of times. Against a mob that doesn't proc anything the affect should be identical.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry but that's wrong, you cannot avoid a proc - they go off on a hit OR a miss.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorthag</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm...Didn't do solid test work in the mid levels, but have built up a pretty solid sample set, using only soldiers of fire, same ac, combat stats all at 305....  LR 1 showed a boost of 1.1% misses compared to pre-LR1... LR 5, however, is only showing a boost of 2.6% over LR1, total of 3.7% additional misses..LR5 sample set only half the size of prior sets, still building it up, but shouldn't vary by more than 0.2-0.3% at this point, if that much.....not a fully scientific test, as this was numerous mobs over the course of exping, but should be reasonably accurate, since all soldiers of fire are 65, and had same buffs throughout the course of parsing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorthag</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok...built up a more sizeable parse set, total of 6000 attacks at LR5 resulted in 34.53% miss ratio, compared to a 32.64% ratio on 7500 attacks at LR1...right about 2% for 4 levels, or 0.5% boost per level, something may be off on my pre-LR dataset, would have to rummage through that incredibly huge logfile of about 30AA worth of exping in fire to double check....</div></div><hr />

Now, that sounds like it's inferring you are dual wielding. Will you flurry with a 2-handed weapon? If so, I may have to get it and punishing blade and pick me up a 2hander.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorthag</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Flurry is niiice on 2 handers =)<br />
<br />
Parse results on FotA vs CF3<br />
<br />
CF3 - 14,965 hits, 812 crits - 5.43%<br />
FotA1 - 4067 hits, 296 crits - 7.27%<br />
FotA2 - 7176 hits, 543 crits - 7.57%<br />
FotA3 - 3435 hits, 289 crits - 8.41%  (was 13.85% of damage dealt) &lt;--still building up stat pool on this one for final comparison, went through first two levels a bit quick to get a really solid stat set<br />
<br />
So......FotA1 VERY worth it for the points you spend, 1.84% boost for first level, compared to 1.14% boost for the next two levels combined......so if you're working up your offensive AAs.....grab FotA1 quick, but save the second two levels until you're towards the end...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorthag</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, built up solid dataset for FotA3<br />
20,623 hits, 1714 crits, 8.31% crit rate for 13.26% of damage.. pretty much right on target with previous set... looks like right about 3% boost for FotA, with the majority of that coming from the first point...standard diminishing returns. =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorthag</div><div class="date">06-29-2003, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Flurry 4-6 is very noticeable difference, using only 2 hander, I'll often get 6-10 flurries off during the course of a 90-110 second fight....unfortunately, I have yet to see a parser that can actually track flurry rates, and separate those attacks from regular...and I'm not gonna do it by hand.. =) Flurry rate was noticably boosted though, and dps did get a minor change....somewhere in the range of 5-10% dps boost going from Flurry 1 to Flurry 6 - possbly a little more, hard to tell how much was from gear boost and getting FA on my shammy, and how much was strictly from Flurry though, did not do conclusive isolated testing on that</div></div><hr />
