<br />
<br />
Anyhow, anyone use this thing on a regular basis, and if so how does it work for ya?<br />
<br />
Usually i use a BoC / Obsidian Scrimi or Taunt hammer   for tanking.<br />
<br />
<br />
also , what is the serverwide war channel, i had it autojoined a long time ago , but never rejoined it after changing comps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beeffy Jeerky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">doh after posting i saw 18million similer threads, anyhow i would like to konw the warrior channel / pswd</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mahulk Keras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Have this weapon myself and used to have a BoC (gave back when i left guild). I miss my BoC. The Obsidian Greatblade is nice but its clearly not enough to hold agro in a guild that is in SolRo, all damage dealers equiped decently at that point will pull agro off you unless you get these lucky fights where you seem to proc like hell. Proc rate on Obsidian Greatblade is not great... and given its a 2hander its really not good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well it drops off a laughably easy fiend, so what do you expect?<br />
<br />
It loses to BoC by far.  It's not good for any heavy duty tanking but it's good enough for XP groups.  The ratio is decent and might even beat BoC + one weapon of the similar ratio, and the extra AC on it helps a lot, and also there's the standard bonus of 2H like less Ripostes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well..all depends on what you're using it for....solo/botting &amp; group work with smart casters, no problem, the dps is nice, and as long as you're not in fire, it procs enough that you'll probably have the dot going full time or near it, which is an extra 4 dps - not much, but every lil bit does help...<br />
<br />
As far as raids go though....when using OG, you're a DPS tank, or someone to tankmez mobs... speaking from experience, you will find it near impossible to hold aggro on a mob unless you've been tankmezzing it for awhile - standard pull, engage, hit taunt, and call engage for raid will result in the mob running around and beating the fek out of whoever it wants to, other than you...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You're thinking of Ornate Greatblade which procs Boil Blood off General Durav Flamesinger in Fire.  This is the Obsidian Greatblade.  Taunting blow is your standard nonresistable aggro proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If your trying to avoid ripo damage, its a good weapon though for agro the boc is probably better.  I like the obs that I have. It works reasonably well but probably not as good as a boc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">One of our smaller tanks uses it a lot for off-tanking and it works great for that.</div></div><hr />
