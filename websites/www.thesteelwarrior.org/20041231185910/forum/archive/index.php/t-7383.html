<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jerseth</div><div class="date">05-31-2004, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A new question has arisen -- one that needs to definately be answered and thought about.<br />
<br />
Before I ask, here's what brough this up:<br />
<br />
We all know how warriors are pretty much made by their gear. We're the most gear-dependant class out of every other, because our main role is based so heavily on AC/HP.<br />
<br />
Now, stats really don't matter at the 60+ mark because of the wave of new buffs that will easily max your stats. <br />
<br />
From what I've seen, and from what others have said, it pretty much comes down to how much raw HP you have and your AC count.<br />
<br />
So here's the question.<br />
<br />
What is the statistical number where you know you are a strong tank? I mean, I know that more AC and HP is better, but there has to be a certain milestone, a point, where you can say &quot;Yea. I'm a good tank.&quot;<br />
<br />
Let me elaborate. How do you gauge or measure your War-ability and overall statistical standing?<br />
<br />
I've heard that the minimum for any strong warrior at 60 is 1300+ AC and 4k+ hp. <br />
<br />
What about at 65?<br />
<br />
Etc etc.<br />
<br />
I ask this because I want to know how much more I have to buy, etc, before I become a really statistically strong warrior.<br />
<br />
At level 61 -- Hp 4055, AC -- 1234</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">05-31-2004, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Where do you want to be a strong tank?  There is a big difference between tanking in LoY vs. PoP, for example, but both have XP zones at level 65.<br />
<br />
For LoY, I'd say 1200 AC and 4k hp.<br />
For PoP tier 2 or easy LDON, I'd say 1300 AC and 5k hp.<br />
For PoP tier 3, I'd say 1400 AC and 6k hp.<br />
For PoP tier 4 or hard LDON or GoD tier 1, I'd say 1500 AC and 7k hp.<br />
<br />
Certainly you could do these places with less hp/AC, but I personally wouldn't call you a &quot;strong tank&quot; in that case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vamcoy</div><div class="date">05-31-2004, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">sassinak is that buffed or unbuffed numbers?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keane Abrams</div><div class="date">05-31-2004, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am fairly certain Sass means unbuffed in the chart above. And Sass is right, it all depends on where you are tanking and the people you play with.<br />
<br />
I would say a &quot;good&quot; tank is someone who keeps good aggro and allows an exp group to chain pull without the healer running oom. It is all relative to what place you are progression wise in the game and where you want to tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GoldoraK</div><div class="date">05-31-2004, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well seriously, i dont think you can get any specific answer to your question...  aa will make some bigg help for your hp,and there is not much real ac in aa... but with time, and raid and/or ldon you'll get your ac up... a bad tank is only some-1 who doesnt pay attention,or doesnt ask any questions... at lvl 65 , you can start thinking about the stats... till then, keep reading on some technic to use when tanking...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">05-31-2004, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sass I think your numbers for pop tier 3 and 4 and god/ldon hard are a bit high. I tank ele, ldon hard, god trials, etc easily at 1500ac 6500hp, and know people who pull it off pretty well with 1400ac 5800ish hp.<br />
<br />
When it comes down to determining if you are a good tank or not, the most important things to consider are of course your level/gear/aa, but also where you are grouping, and with whom. I've done ldon/god trials with time+ geared folks and wiped over and over again, yet when I do the same things with friends that are nowhere near as well geared, we own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">05-31-2004, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I went on a raid in PoP tier-4 where the MT had only 1500ac unbuffed I'd either leave or tank myself. At that point in the game it won't cut it. Disparity of dps 'per round' at that AC would suck and the tank would die or the cheal chain would be going like crazy to keep up. 1700 for tier-4 for raid (not talking exp groups where yeah 1500ac could survive allbeit dubiously).<br />
<br />
And for Time or past Vxed/Tipt in GoD. 2000 ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">05-31-2004, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nek, I wasn't commenting on whether such things were possible, but only on what constitutes a &quot;strong tank&quot;.  I can tank Tipt/Vxed at 7360/1470, and I know an equivalent tank who has successfully farmed Pixtt Annihilator.  But I would not call myself (or him) a &quot;strong tank&quot; for that content.<br />
<br />
Naturally, I agree that &quot;strong tank&quot; means something very different from &quot;good tank&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">06-01-2004, 12:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well to become a strong tank&quot;statiscally&quot; is to compare yourself to tanks around you.I don't think Sass's numbers are bad for feeling ok about tanking that content.I'd say if you want to feel like a strong tank get your defensive aa and 65 and start raiding.Buying all the gear in the Bazaar won't make you a strong tank at 65 on an old server except in very specific company.<br />
<br />
It's just numbers though.How strong you appear tanking also has a lot to do with your healing and what you're raiding -xping on.In becoming a &quot;stronger&quot; tank you'll probably always set new goals/milstones throughout your playtime.I want 2k ac now hehe.<br />
<br />
 I usually buff to around 10300 with tribute and some leadership aa atm.We're dkp and I don't feel like I'm a very strong statistical tank in eq to ma for an ep guild ,but, we do very well.Great leadership and teamwork with strong healers(cough di) sees me standing at the end of almost all our boss fights.Granted, we're just starting the big boys.We've killed Fennin twice now and will probably be seriously challenged in water and earth soon.<br />
<br />
Sooo... being a &quot;strong tank&quot; is always relative to where you're playing and who with.Being a &quot;good&quot; tank means focusing on control of mobs in your camp with aggro and positioning.Good aggro weapons,defensive aa and fore- knowledge of your fighting environment will go a long way.Er...well i'm usually without the last one.<br />
<br />
Good luck! Tanking's fun. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ernie</div><div class="date">06-01-2004, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Title: Give me a number. ( How do you know when you're a good warrior? ) <br />
<br />
I think looking at a numerical evaluation is a poor choice.  I feel that I am a &quot;strong tank&quot; and a &quot;good tank&quot; for the content that I usually tank, because of the comments of the people around me.  <br />
<br />
I feel that this has to do with my attentivness to the game, mob placement and the raid around me, the proper use of my disciplines at the right time for the best effect and the use of my gear for best effect.  Along with this I generally have fun playing the game and engage my fellow players in fun, often lighthearted, conversation and role-play, making my company more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
But if have to have numbers, then to pull from an earlier post<br />
<br />
For LoY, 1200 AC and 4k hp.<br />
For Velious 1300 AC and 4.5k hp<br />
For PoP tier 1 or easy LDON, I'd say 1300 AC and 5k hp.<br />
For PoP tier 2, I'd say 1400 AC and 5.5k hp.<br />
For PoP tier 3, Vex Thall, hard LDON or GoD tier 1, I'd say 1450 AC and 6.5k hp.<br />
<br />
I can't comment about ele planes, cause I'm not there, but at 1521 ac and 6788 hp unbuffed I feel confident and &quot;strong&quot; with any PoP content I have access too (still need MM for SRT and RZtW for ELE - both pretty damn impossible with the current wall bugs), Hard LDoN, any previous expansion (Luclin, Velious, etc.) and squeeked by with great healing to tank through GoD trial 6 this weekend.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I entered diffferent levels with the following HP (buffed, can't remember unbuffed cos spells get better, tribute, leadership AAs etc)<br />
<br />
Velious - 7000hp 1200AC<br />
Ssra/Tier 1 PoP - around 8000hp 1300AC<br />
VT/Tier 2 and 3 PoP - 8500hp 1400AC<br />
Tier 4 and EP - 9000hp 1500AC<br />
<br />
I gained 1000hp in EP very quickly thanks to high HP gear, Sturdiness, Leader AA etc and now raid buffed nearly 10200hp and 1850AC</div></div><hr />

<br />
Come on now, when we first got into the elemental planes (first on our server) none of our warriors had that many hps so its certainly not required.  And I would say defensive AAs are pretty much a requirement.</div></div><hr />

Gorlab is wise.  This question reeks of the same delusions that causes some rangers to run around looking for groups advertising EQ/AM3... like that makes them a good player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kragrock</div><div class="date">06-15-2004, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was tanking PoEarth tonight, was only the yard trash at the zone in but we chain pulled constantly for approx 3 hours.  Only time I died was a couple of deaths on the Prismatic Croc and they were only deaths due to errors.  Soon fixed those and lived on Prismatic on 3rd attemp with ease.  Buffed I was at just over 1400 AC and under 8k hp.  None of trash came close to killing either me or my group.  Only lost agro to crit dots a couple of times, but they seem bugged atm anyways.  For weapons I only had CHSD with anger 2 and red epic with anger 2.  So for experience groups you dont need to have the high numbers mentioned above.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Three quick questions for you:<br />
<br />
1) What are your unbuffed AC/HP?  Since I don't know what buffs you had available, I can't really compare what I've got--and I'm wondering if I could survive PoEarth XPing.<br />
<br />
2) Can you tell us what defensive AA's you have?  I'm suspecting you've got at least CA3/CS3, if not LR5/ID5.  But I'm curious.<br />
<br />
3) Why are you using the red epic instead of, for example, a GBoS?  It's not hard to get one of those, even on a pickup raid, and it's significantly better aggro than the red epic (IMHO, at least), especially given that the offhand procs half as often as the main hand.  And why Anger II instead of a Yak proc?<br />
<br />
Thanks much,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 12:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">PoE mobs don't hit much hard than BoT mobs, mostly hitting max in the 600's.  They do mitigate slow and several have annoy DoT or Snare procs, dillos have DD procs and split (who'd have thought the scariest mob in the zone is a pregnant female? &lt;joking...&gt;) named are a little nastier which was never a problem when I was XPing there cos they traps were broken but I guess they're alot more common now.<br />
<br />
If you are wondering whether you can tank in PoE think about it this way... when you tank in BoT do you get your arse handed to you until slow lands or not?  If clerics need to pour on the Supernal Lights or Remedys until slow lands in BoT then they'll probably be doing the same for longer in PoE and they'll run out of mana or XP will be slower or whatever.  Dillo's in particular can be really resistant (I box a chanter so I've experienced 1st hand on some occasions simply not being able to land slow on one).  <br />
<br />
While the elementals are a step up in difficulty from BoT/Sol Ro just like Nightmare -&gt; Valor or Valor -&gt; BoT, its not really an extreme jump, Mobs dont hit alot harder its more their proc's that make a difference.  A good group in BoT will succeed in PoEarth fairly well, a bad group in BoT would likely have more trouble until they sort themselves out.  You've really got to go somewhere like the 2nd field in PoFire or 2nd Castle (and tank the mobs not kite them) to notice a big increase in the DPS of the mobs you are killing, and with it comes a chunk more XP from killing yellows and reds rather than blues/whites.<br />
<br />
FWIW when I started XPing there I was raid buffing to about 8.5k (so close to 8k in XP groups), no idea on AC but 1400 probably would have been close, using BoC/ Red Epic or BBB to tank.  Certainly had LR5/CS3 then, think I finished off ID5 and PD3 at the PoE Ledge.  It wasnt trivial, but deaths we're few and far between and we made great XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 01:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">having LR5/ID5 dosen't necessarily make a tank good, but not having it does make a tank, at least in hard ldon's/ele's, bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kragrock</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 05:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Buffs wise, I was pretty close to raid buffed.  The guild had 2 groups in the zone so was able to almost get a full set.  Think I had druid/cleric/shammy/ranger and Enchanter buffs.  About all I was really missing was BSS from pallies.<br />
<br />
As to why Red Epic, well the answer is pretty simple.  I never really spent a lot of time in BoT.  I dont do pick up raids, never have and never will and it would be hard to do so now anyways as I am now on a server where in the 4 months I have been playing there, I havent seen a single pick up raid anyways.  I have been given the option of getting a BoC out the guild bank and might take that up soon.  Although I must admit to still being reluctant to spend DKP on a weapon that I dont expect to last me a long time.<br />
<br />
BTW I have LR3 and ID3 atm, although that will soon be remidied the way the experience was flowing last night.  To be fair though, I did have a solid group behind me.  This was a guild group and we all knew each other pretty well and worked well as a team.  I suspect they made up for the shortfalls I currently have.  Best thing to do is try it, would be my guess.  Give it an hour and see how you do there.  We spent the whole time pulling trees and crocs, the crocs were easy kills and the trees were not so bad, except for annoying snare proc they had.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's the thing.Your hp/ac are only part of the equation.I t depends on your group.I would say most tanks that make it to ep's can tank whites and blues np with a good group.Probably, a lot of ep beasts could tank fine with a cleric and dedicated slower on single pulls.After slows in the necro can tank.Tanking red cons,multi pulls,lacking slow,or using a lighter healer can require a heavier tank.My wife (shammy) can solo heal and slow with me on whites in fire np.A lighter tank may need a druid/cleric and dedicated slower.Hehe,I'm pretty sure a cleric would find healing a velious geared tank in poe less stressful than healing me in Tipt. :) Of course being able to do it and being a &quot;strong&quot; tank for the content are differant things.<br />
<br />
When we first cleared ep's minus the big 4 i think I buffed to around 8.5k.It went very well including mobs like Reparm(always some luck here though di is the win hehe) and Ofassa.<br />
<br />
Heals and debuffs &gt; ac/hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">a good test for whether or not you can tank PoEs:  pick one<br />
<br />
1. head into a BoT tower and pull krigers and dont slow them<br />
<br />
2. head into hard ldon and run them till you are blue in the face<br />
<br />
<br />
at 9.6k/1600 buffed with max defensive aa's, i have no problems tanking any groupable named and xp trash anywhere in earth.<br />
<br />
at under 8khp and 1400 ac raid buffed, you really dont need to be tanking Plane of Earth for xp.  sure, you can make it work with a talented healer, but in the end you're the weak link in the group. mobs mitigate slow ... armadillos proc 700dd (lots) ... etc.  A tank of said stature can do just fine with single pulls, quick slows, and a good healer, but what do you do when that add comes on a pull and your mob isnt going to be slowed asap ( not to mention the 1-4 rounds you will take from the add before it is mezzed).  XP is PoE is top notch, but your time may well be better spent in ldon/hard ldon getting gear and hp/ac augments.<br />
<br />
Plane of Water is completely different.  The zin isnt very hard, but as soon as you get to white cons you have trash which hits for 1k ... go even deeper to the yellow cons and you have trash which can QUAD for 1100 (all mitigate slow).  regrua's can hit for almost 1300, but the only triple in my experience, and are therefore a bit easier than savage krakens etc.  Dive deep enough and i even run into problems now and then at full raid buffs with only 1 healer.<br />
<br />
I have not done air yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd agree with above posters:  to be a strong tank in EP's and Hard ldon you need around 7khps unbuffed and 1500 ac unbuffed.   you can make do with less, but you will be far from a &quot;strong tank&quot;.</div></div><hr />

  I would agree with this. LvL's AA's and the ability to hold down your camp and always  placing the boss  mobs where you want or need. Like the last time we ran to drop AoW I was tanking Idol as normal and we could not corner him where we normaly do at the ramp corner so i had to dance with him. After he droped nobody could belive that i had just spun that  mob around in  a circle and never losing agro once or going OOR to healers. That to me is a &quot;Strong tank&quot; and a &quot;Good tank&quot;  because of the comments of the people around me</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that is a bit high.  I have about 6300hp and 1400AC unbuffed and I tank in elementals all the time and I don't think they are all that hard at my level.  I have raid tanked reparm, the PoE events, many of the events in air (including those stupid transparent spiders-- tanked multiple spiders on poAir raids many times).  I have exp tanked BoT and LDoN easy unslowed (no slower at all) and poE/poFire in single groups trivially.  I think with all the defensive AA and 5.5 to 6k unbuffed hp and 1350 AC you can do quite well in elementals but your biggest factor is how well you hold agro and how good your healer is.  I don't consider myself an exceptional tank and I think anyone with my same gear should be able to do as well but they do have to understand teamwork and have some ideas of what to expect from mobs and their group/raid partners.</div></div><hr />

Of course, that involves a lot of augments and a lot of points to get.  That is about 1450ac and 7300hp unbuffed (which breaches 9k hp, but lacks in the AC).  I didn't include AC augs in calculations, and there is a good deal of bazaar gear, ornate, and GoD single-group gear that one can look forward to getting.</div></div><hr />

I have about 36 AA's, with most of them in AA's that raise my hpts.  The thing that I have learn recently is that hps, and ac are very good but where its at is in defensive AA's.<br />
You can be over 11k hps with good gear but if some of the mobs hit and dont miss sometimes your not gonna last long.<br />

Nice magelo, though.  Warriors without a couple key items (Scalecracker, Cloak of Nonexistent Vampire) will be closer to 1600 AC before tribute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oomwarrior</div><div class="date">06-21-2004, 09:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ahh thanx for the hint of why the AC is off. going to go fix that so it reflect the right AC.   vamp really isnt that hard to get cuz all you need is to park a camper to track him and check up on him once a day or so.  vamp isnt quite as camped as it used to be.  as long as you can hold aggro your wizzy/necro/cleric can burn it down.<br />
<br />
anyway, the signficance of my magelo is that everything i'm wearing can either be bought, or 1 grouped.(yes a fairly high level group, but still 1 grouped)  i'm kinda stuck with these gear unless i decide to drop my guild and join an elem guild.  not sure i'm ready for that yet tho.</div></div><hr />

That wouldn't be disturbing if I hadn't had it happen. Now, I'm nowhere near MOST of you in HP/AC/AA. I know my agro, I hold it. I have 4870HP 1197AC unbuffed. CA3 LR5 CS1 PE for defensive AAs when I first entered Earth. My fiancee 65 beastlord was slowing. We didn't have problems, even on the rares. Up to CA3 LR5 CS3 PE now and my 4 pieces Thurgadin quest armor (rawr!)  :D haven't let me down yet. It's really all about agro... the only time I had a problem was when The PB hopped into camp and when I stonewalled decided to hit me with his full range of attacks, riposte ALL 4 of mine, and proceed to rampage. Ow. Granted, that didn't go over well, but I have a feeling it wouldn't go over well for most tanks. I don't even reach 8,000 HP or 1350 AC yet. I realize that's pretty damn embarassing at my level, but skill will compensate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Imo you are a good warrior when you are able to do well in zones you play in. The number of hp/ac doesnt mean much if you suck. I personally have more respect for people that have not that great of gear but are able to fair well in tough enviroment. I consider them the best warriors not the ppl who try to measure how good they are by only their gear. Of course if you have both skill and gear all the better.<br />
<br />
The way you put the question skill does not matter only your gear. Also disregarding AAs is not wise. Skill and AAs go a long way to distinguish warriors. Also knowledge of the zone and what expect from each mob how to engage it where. If some dumb ass tanks AE mob next to casters ac/hp wont save them from geting some rude comments, etc.</div></div><hr />

All the gear in the world wont make up for a retarded player ... but on the flip side all the talent in the world aint gonna make up for shitty gear.<br />
<br />
People have done more with less ... remeber that ... use what you have and constantly try to locate upgrades and think of ways to better yourself.<br />
<br />
Talent + time invested (aas/gear are the proof) = a good warrior.</div></div><hr />
