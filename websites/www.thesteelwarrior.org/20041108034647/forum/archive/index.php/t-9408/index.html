<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I want to start an alt of some sort for when i cant get anything going with my war.  I want a melee class (im pretty sure) but not a shadow knight.  Mainly deciding between a rogue, ranger or paladin.  anyone have any suggestions?<br />
<br />
PS might look at casters too, considering a class that can solo so i dont have to further rely on getting a group...any soloing class suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Beastlord</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Beastlord<br />
<br />
/agree</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My vote for a melee flavor alt would be Beastlord.  For a caster, can't go wrong a druid, a very flexible class, imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No rangers please, we don't need any more Legggaasooolaaaasss twinks =(<br />
<br />
Albeit, rangers are pretty damn fun at the lower levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">can beastlords solo relatively well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes.<br />
<br />
They get pets, Slowspells, heal spells, heal pet spells .. etc.<br />
Definately a good solo class, especially in outdoor areas.<br />
And fairly flexible too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">heh thanks will try BL probably...any race suggestions?  NOT vah shir though, i don like em<br />
<br />
PS might be lookin at ikky BL<br />
<br />
PPS heh im looking at this casters realm creation guide (just to get an idea), and im not liking their suggestion to put all the points in wisdom...maybe all in str would be a better idea...i dunno tho lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">All the BL races works fairly well, though at very early levels, the Trolls and Iksars have the innate Regeneration going for them, which will help until they get their pets 'n' stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">heh i think im gonna go ikky...and put the points into str</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Heh, put 'em into whatever you want to - But remember that Beastlords also get stat buffs, so might be wise to put stat points into a stat you cannot buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">...heh like wisdom...hmm a decision...ikky base wisdom is 90, but str is base 70...or even stamina maybe...heh im not good at decision making yet, hence the reason i started this post :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">70 strength isn't as bad as it might sound - Remember that as a Beastie, you'll be using Leather type armor ... it's not as heavy as Plate armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">hmm i think im going to put 10 in str and 10 in wisdom.  hehe balancing is the way to go when   ya cant decide :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Heh, well, I'll leave the decision up to you - That's part of the fun of creating a enw character after all. :)<br />
That, and I have to go now .. got a bus I have to catch.<br />
<br />
Good luck. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">made ikky BL, 10 in str and 10 in wis and hes in me guild already. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Nice, I'm kinda curious as to how you are gonna twink him out. <br />
And I'm guessing you'll be hitting Paludal Caverns early too ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>czai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I went monk for my alt, can't beat the FD when you have to AFK.</div></div><hr />

I usually hit PC at lvl 9 from the SWT side.  I didnt really twink him (i only have 120pp total) so i just got him a Polished Steel Ulak, stipped and deleted my lvl 4 rogue and got him to lvl 5 in the tutorial last night.  If i had the funds, you bet id twink him lol.</div></div><hr />

Buy my 32 Iksar Beastlord twink!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">remade him tonight (all 20 in wis) then managed to sell my zek crested buckler for 3k (twice what i paid for it hehe) and &quot;twinked&quot; him out (mostly in studded acrylia crap).  so far he is quite fun :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Heh, I had a Monk for the AFK FD too.<br />
And a Rogue for the Hide AFK.<br />
<br />
Heh.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I once saw a group of 4 level 4 Ogre's start hunting in Paludal Caverns, they had a hard time until they became level 6 or so, which is the level the MOBs are at the entrance.<br />
<br />
Anyways, Beastlord starts to shine at level 9+ ... ie. once they get their pets and spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tutorial huh ?<br />
I've never even *seen* the tutorial !  :D <br />
How does it look like ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ronaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">shoulda made a necro ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">He said he wanted to Melee some in the first post, Necro's aren't terribly good at Melee.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">then use a SK ...<br />
<br />
/bonk<br />
arrrgh not he said he doesn't want a SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">shoulda made a necro ;)<br />
<br />
heh tried necro, didnt like him too much.  i like melee betta  :D<br />
<br />
then use a SK ...<br />
<br />
/bonk<br />
arrrgh not he said he doesn't want a SK.<br />
<br />
hehe nope ive played 2 of em and they got boring really quickly :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Riggor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Make an Iksar necro, put it all in Sta. Don't even need to hardly gear them if your just messing around. Dont worry about int you have the best mana regen in the game, go with hp and regeneration. Once your in the 30's and get that 70% undead slow you can solo Kaesora. It's very nice that you can invis without losing your pet now. <br />
<br />
Oddly enough pet taunt does not seem to fail and it seems like they only need to be within the sight of the mob to use it. I pull with slow and pet alwase taunts it off.<br />
<br />
I have a 47 necro that has been pretty fun, my friend started a Bst and I can't think of a better duo. Just hunt undead in Kaesora, then move on to city of mist. Both of which are hot spots.<br />
<br />
I like iksar necro alot because of lifetaps, mana regen, Dot's, good pet, mezz, FD, gate, normal invis, itu... the draw back is the 20% xp penalty, but the tail more then makes up for it :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sirphoenix_18</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Hum, a beastlord sounds fun.  I pretty much have the best buyable stuff in the bazaar so I think I'll twink one this weekend.  I think I'll do the tutorial too, never been through it and I'm kind of interested to see how it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Tutorial is awesome, good xp for little time effort.  I reccomend Iksar cause Iksar are cool :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">How is the Alt coming along .. gotten spells yet ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Vilicontus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Read up on PoK quests that gives focus items like mana pres and ext range that a beastlord can wear up to 44. My level 19 bst has 1 or 2 of those and not that twinked either (2k worth maybe). And yes once you get a pet you can do so much solo wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">How is the Alt coming along .. gotten spells yet ?<br />
<br />
lvl 10 so far...see signature hehe.  i do have my lvl 9 spells, am planning to get temp on me and pet and solo kurns next time im on him</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Oh yeah, do pets still go *poof* when you zone ?<br />
<br />
Edit : Oh and a cheap Piercer to skill up with is the Crystalline Spider Fang, cheap as hell and it's a Dam 10, Delay 22 piercer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Not usin piercing, usin Hand to Hand.  For now at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">not a rogue. they solo like warriors. meaning they dont. if you have a warrior and a rogue thats great but dont think either of them will get you by when you dont have time for a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Wilamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Just a quick tip, just like your warrior try and keep all 1hb, 2hb hth and piercing up today you can get some nice cheap weapons for a low lvl BL.<br />
<br />
They are a great solo class if thats what your after 1-65 solo np.<br />
<br />
Oh I do it the other way around BL main Warrior alt).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">yea i want a solo option for when i cant get anything going with me war<br />
<br />
and im poor, and the polished steel ulak was only 5pp... :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">He he, that's what I meant with the Crystalline Spider Fang ... last I played it sold for less than 30pp.  :D <br />
And it's just fine to keep the skill up with.<br />
<br />
Especially once you get dualwield, if you don't have it already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">dual weild at 17...i think i will get somethin for him that is piercing...tho i have like 120pp hehe<br />
<br />
what other cheap fast weapons are there that i could work up me skill with?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I have an Ikkie BL myself, I'd suggest looking into the newbie quests in Cabilils, especially the claw.  The final one is pretty good, imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">got the spider fang...have it equipped instead of the ulak atm, gonna put ulak in secondary when i get dual wield...which wont be for a while, i have to really get to work on lvling my warrior up to 65.  Wheres a(some) good place(s) to get 57-62?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Out of curiosity .. how much did the Spider Fang cost you ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">125pp...other one up was 1 freakin k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Bustauff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">My solo alt was a Shaman, solo'ed from 1 to 50. Then transfered him to his own account and 2 boxed him to 58.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">125pp...other one up was 1 freakin k<br />
<br />
Jesus wept !!<br />
