I know its Mail armor not plate but the AC is as high as most plate armors and +20 to Defense is nice. I was more interested in the 5% proc on it. Guildie found the plans last night and I was wondering if anyone has had experience with it or knows someone who has it. From what I understand it creates a barrier that protects your from physical attacks for a few seconds, but if u melee it goes away very quick. Just thinking if it blocks even one or two attacks before you make it go away then it may still be a great armor to have for tanking. Or is this only useful for Shamans who can still cast while the effect is up.</div></div><hr />

Endgame BP, atm, for Shaman.  The only gripe about it is no Stats.  Otherwise VERY nice, hehee.</div></div><hr />

Well the proc isnt as effective when meleeing.  As it drops if you physically attack a mob.<br />

To answer your question...No I dont think it is suitable for a warrior.</div></div><hr />

When the shield goes up you lose all aggro! There is also a blue trinket out there with the same effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">03-02-2005, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lose all aggro!! Well that definately settles it not gonna get that....... was considering how it would effect you if you wielded a slow Hard hitting weapon like Hammer of the Titans or Arcanite Reaper since the shield would last a few seconds in between atttacks but to lose all aggro would be horrible for a warrior..... glad you pointed that out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">03-02-2005, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">is your aggro really wiped or is it working as EQ's DA : you recover your former aggro when the shield wears out ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">03-02-2005, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">30 Arcanite aint no joke either, took me a month to get 18 for my Frostguard. We have the pattern for this in my guild, if it didn't turn off when you were attacking I would definitely get one made for solo/pvp - Ugle are you certain it does?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">03-02-2005, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Off topic a little bit. How do you like Frostguard I'm still 3 lvls short of using mine, would you say it's better then Krol Blade?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">03-02-2005, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, I tossed a crusader ench on my Frostguard and it doesn't proc very often, kinda slow also with a 2.5 delay. I mainly had it made because rogues get priority on most of the nice 40+ dps weapons we get on raids.<br />
<br />
I'm using a 2h arms spec currently though, so I haven't used it enough to tell really. Seemed pretty good for soloing the few times I used it with a Thrashblade offhand.</div></div><hr />

Yes, dont own one myself...but my best friend does.  He likes it as he can pop off a spell when it triggers.</div></div><hr />

Playing on the Horde I'm not positive about that. You would need to ask a Paladin.</div></div><hr />
