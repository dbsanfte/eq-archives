<br />
Would a non-monk get the bo stick?</div></div><hr />

I have seen a few clerics and druids at the casino guy im at.  I was just wondering if i should try my luck at the other guys or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>thundersam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Casino sux, used 200k and no gold ticket GG</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>shadowedspawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Different casino guys give out different illusion potions and stat foods.   Dropped 10k on each and walked away w/ a backpack full of illusion potions, snakefinger (monk guy only gives these out) a fecktonne of destroyed stat foods, a few quest gems, and like 8 gnomish fireworks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I got myself a deluxe sewing kit at the previous casino. Did pretty well that time.<br />
<br />
No luck so far this time, yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The only difference between the vendors are the food they give. All of them give Snakefingers, Stones, Sewing Kits, illusions, and gold tickets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Injektilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Took me over 550k and i still didnt get a golden ticket heh.  Druid in the guild got one though and felt bad for me and let me have it, got a Guise of all things =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I blew about 150k in the casino before winning a golden ticket. I started to hand it in then got nervous, what are the chances of getting a Guise of the Deceiver? Now, Im a dark elf mind you, and a Guise would be a nice waste of a ticket. I got so worked up over it I actually ran my cleric to SH to do the ticket hand in since most of the other items are droppable, i figured I could pass the winning item back to my warrior.<br />
<br />
I handed in the ticket to the npc and a shiny new Guise of the Deceiver appeared on her cursor. :eek: <br />
<br />
Glad i was planning ahead :p <br />
<br />
Anyway, winning tickets Ive seen produce mostly what was listed already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">450k and 3 Gold Tickets later:<br />

I am trying to save for gear upgrades, but I just can't stay away...<br />
<br />
Fortunately I've only blown 20k so far, and of course no golden ticket.<br />
<br />
550k!?!!?!  Yeesh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kokonut Pye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I don't believe you can get a Drogmor...however, you can get Vibrating Gauntlets of Infuse, the cleric gauntlets that click to transform into a hammer.<br />
<br />
We have 4 gold tickets in my guild so far...2 Guises, 1 Gaunts, 1 Rubi BP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bourbon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You guys are going about this the wrong way.  I got a gold ticket out of a candy bar and now I own the whole chocolate factory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Malstorme</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Is there any advantage to playing more than one coin in a stack?  I have blown around 50K so far, but got frustrated because the odds or chances aren't available anywhere that I've found.  I generally played 4 tokens (unstacked) per turn in, but wondered if the odds were better playing stacks of 2 or 4 or 10 or something.  I've gotten snake fingers and beer goggles, but no golden ticket.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You can play at most 4 per turn in. 1 in each slot. Putting more in just wastes them.</div></div><hr />

Around 160k spent for me, 0 tickets.  At this point I'm just going back on sheer principle.  I've been doing the same.  1.2 million pp later I have still not seen a gold ticket.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Retnaburn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I'm on Stormhammer. I spent about 20k a few patches ago and didn't get anything but illusion potions, a deluxe box, and food. A couple days ago I sold a Windblade for 45k and blew it (with some hesitation) on the casino. I won Beer Goggles after about 15k, which suits my irl personality =p I had about 4k in tokens left when I got my golden ticket. I didn't get what I wanted, the pre nerf fungi staff, but I got a Ton Po's stick which I sold for 120k. It might be worth mentioning that I have a Guise of the Deceiver that I won at an event, but I can't say for sure that you can get duplicate prizes for the ticket.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Over the course of the Casino first htting the scene I have put in about 200k.<br />
<br />
Saterday I got 2 GT's in about a 15 minute period and 40k worth of tokens. Had I been thinking, I would have sold them.<br />
<br />
First one netted a Ruby BP =/<br />
Second netted a TP Staff of la~<br />
<br />
EDIT: Sold the TOn P's Bo Staff for 67500pp and one of my  fungi tunics for 80k(bought for 25k almost a year ago) so I am not as miffed about getting crap for my tickets now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Sweet.  Don't you sometimes wish things in EQ could be taken into real life?  Beer goggles would definitely be one of my first choices.  Guise of the deceiver would be really cool too.  :D</div></div><hr />

Not sure if they have anything protecting against it with gold tickets, but I know I've gotten the lore item message when turning in tokens, most likely from getting more beer goggles after I already have them.</div></div><hr />

Sigh, what a waste. I just wish you could turn in your prize for another ticket so I could get my DE mask.</div></div><hr />
