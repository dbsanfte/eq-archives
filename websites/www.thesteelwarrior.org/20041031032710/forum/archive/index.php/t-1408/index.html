<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bearking</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been working on fletching as a skill.  Currently I am trying to figure out what components will go with bundled acrylia shaft.  I have yet to figure out what other components I need to combine with to make an arrow and have been unable to locate any combines on the charts that I have looked at.<br />
<br />
Just wondering if anyone has made this arrow type and if so would you be so kind to enlighten me as to what works - seeing as there could be some 216 different combinations I could try :eek: <br />
<br />
Thanks - Be safe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cyphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I got my information from Allakhazam. Just look up Shadow tipped acrylia arrow, or flame tipped or the other one thats + cold damage and youll see the recipes. <br />
<br />
Im at 210 skill now and have been making shadow tipped acrylia arrows until I get to 250. To make the arrowhead you need a chunk of condensed shadow, water flask and a file. This is trivial for a smith at like 130 (forget now), but if youre making the shafts already this should be no problem. Then combine the shadow arrowhead, with the acrylia shaft and a large nock, and round cut fletch to make the arrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Polo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">acrylia arrows skill ups are extremly hard and getting to 250 with them is gonna be a nightmare it costs around 50-60k to go from 202-240 by makeing soughtbought bow's<br />
<br />
240with fletching knife is enuf for max skill combines:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">nothing at eqtraders.com? hmm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, acrylia shafts only combine with arrowheads made out of the &quot;Chunk of Condensed _______&quot; drops that are scattered around Luclin.  You can get a lot of Shadow ones from Akheva fairly easily, and get XP while ya do it (assuming you're 60, that is).<br />
<br />
It shouldn't cost a whole lot of plat to skill up off those, since you can farm all the components.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cyphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I also got some good info from this guy http://www.geocities.com/shadowknight57/ According to him making bows cost around 100kpp to go from 202 to 250. Going that route is less time consuming but costs a lot more than farming components. I farm chunk of condensed shadow from the Shak Draithas in Shadeweavers. The acrylia is a little harder to come buy and I usually just buy it in the bazaar. By buying the acrylia at 50pp avg. its going to cost me around 50-60kpp to get from 202 to 250.</div></div><hr />
