<br />
both those zones the mobs hit for 1k+ (unless affected by the tune down done).<br />
<br />
So at lvl 60will be rough.<br />
<br />
the 2-4th sewers are easier, but in turn the exp is less.<br />
<br />
Can try Quimbi, Bari or Riwwi and see how the exp is for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ejryu</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most mobs in Barindu hit for around 500-600, somewhere in that range.  The exp is pretty mediocre.  The only real advantages now are that their atk isn't ungodly high and you stand a chance for some decent drops.  I'm sure a standard tier 2 group would do fine in there.  Why kill golems for metallic liquid stuff when you could kill ratuks for a ft2 ring?<br />
<br />
Mobs in sewers 1 still can hit for 1k, although it's hella-rare now.  Named like Ukun Packleader still have pretty high atk (was hitting for 900-1.2k pretty consistantly on an enchanter)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I missed the level 60 thing, although Ferubi has been tuned down and the 1k+ hitters are mostly gone.  It's pretty similar to Sol Ro or the elemental planes now.  <br />
<br />
I wouldn't say 1k hitters are &quot;hella rare&quot; in the purifying plant though..I'm not even positive the trials got tuned.  Just about everything hits for 900+ and the even-cons (mostly in the lower level) beat ass.  On one that we didn't get slowed I was chaining SL and still died, and even bard-slowed I was starting CH at 65-70% on an elemental/VT warrior.  Trial 2 and 3 are significantly easier than #1 though.<br />
<br />
Barindu at the Quinimi zone is pretty similar to LDoN easy for exp and difficulty (1% AA per kill, 2-300 hits), with some pretty nice random drops.  I've been told the difficulty/exp go up when you get to the courtyard but I haven't tried it.<br />
<br />
For level 60 exp I'd try Qinimi and if that's easy give Riwii/Barindu a shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Riwwi xp is ass. I was there yesterday, most mobs are under level 55 because force shock was actually stunning them. Was getting 1% aa xp for every 6 kills or so.<br />
<br />
On the plus side, they rarely proc Chaos claws and were hitting for 500 max on the higher level stuff near the arena.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
...on a side note, Kod'taz is the best XP i've had in a long time. 3 hour session gave me 8 and half aa's.</div></div><hr />

I think that sewers are between Barindu and Ferubi but not positive on that.<br />
<br />
I saw a lot of people skipping Riwwi.  Riwwi has some drops that for a level 60ish group would probably be upgrades.  I'd start there and if it is too hard head back to Qinimi and if too easy head to Barindu.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lady Tarnia</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ferubi is easier than Plant although the mobs do have claws going off alot more than they used to.  The first trial has been tuned.  While you still have the 1-1.2K mobs in there, they are not hitting top end as much.  <br />
<br />
Lvl 60s probably would want to avoid the plant and Ferubi unless they are really geared up.  Ferubi has the additional challenge of the random popping dogboys that keep things fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plumppoopsie</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Plant (first sewer trial) is about equal to ferbi, maybe a tad harder.  THe other 3 sewer trials are easier then Ferbi.<br />
<br />
If you can get by the first sewers, the other 3 are just learning how the script for the zone is beat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ejryu</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about mountains?  Prior to the nerf, sewers 1 was a relatively close encounter with a 7k unbuffed all defensive etc aa war, and on Sunday night, we throttled it with a warrior that has around 7k nearly-full buffed.  Did the standards drop for tipt and vxed as much?  I understand that yellow con mobs make the expeditions a little different, but...any insight before I drag a few people into an inevitable slaughter? = )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">XAclylospradaX</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 12:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kod'taz is next to empty still, when there is XP'n going on, it's from one group. I honestly feel fine about that, At first I thought KT was going to end up like a BoT of Gates of Discord, but seemingly the lure of easy 1 group named and awesome XP grinds haven't brought the crowd. <br />
<br />
Of course maybe this is becuase those people have yet to pass the 4 trials(or smith) and vxed/tipt, but still by then I hope to be XP'nin Qvic. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanise</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trials haven't changed much imo. They are not Knight tankable, at least not the final boss. He was tears me up as badly as before. About the only thing sony accomplished was to make them more annoying. Damage isn't consistant anymore, instead it's more spikey.<br />
<br />
Exp doesn't appear to have changed at all either though I must admit I never really paid attn to exp there, but I generally grab 1 AA + misc percent and it seems to be about the same now.<br />
<br />
Mobs hit for less, miss a tad more, but swing faster and slow mitigation is higher. So now you actually end up healing more then you did prior to the &quot;fix&quot;. Pre &quot;fix&quot; I had managed tipt a few times with only my boxed cleric as healer. Now, cleric + druid is needed. Even if you do find a pooka that's charmable their dps has been nerfed so mobs don't die as fast so more healing is required.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We managed to get through the first Purifying Plant last night - 7.5kHP, 1700 AC SK for a tank, I die roughly every fourth to fifth noc, and the Ancient Kaycertops was polite enough to wait until he was at 25% to turn me into floor paste, two whirlwinding monks carried him into the grave. Pre-tune, my average survival time was roughly 3 seconds. Their attack is alot lower, enough that going from 1600 to 1700 AC is an eye-noticable difference. Accuracies seem lower too, but nocs still effectively hit for 1900+ with 50%+ proc rates on Chaos Claws.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since the revamp?  I never noticed the exp was all that.  Great as in 1 AA/hour, 2 AA/hour, 2 AA/3 hour?</div></div><hr />

Where would LDoN normals fall into that mix?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ejryu</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LDoN normals are right around....Riwwi, I think?  I don't remember too much hitting over ~450 pre-nerf.  What do normals max for?  400?  Barindu hits for around 500-600, sewers trials 2 and 4 can max around 800 when you get deeper in, sewers trials 1 and 3 can be upwards of 1k, and Ferubi is around the same level as 1 &amp; 3, roughly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Antii</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;I'm not even positive the trials got tuned&quot;<br />
<br />
Healing in the first 4 trials has been much easier, imo, since they re-tuned...which leads me to believe that the trials did get tuned.  Before, I sometimes had problems healing a 9ish-K (buffed) hp warrior with all defensive aa's etc--running out of mana on a fairly consistent basis and whatnot.  Now, I have no problems healing a pally with ~7k hp (buffed).  The attack ratings were definitely affected.</div></div><hr />
