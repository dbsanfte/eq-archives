Seems our choices are like from mediocre to crap to useless yet try to build something decent out of it.  As in someone could sit on 10+ talent pts and be almost as effective without them.  From what i hear some of the other classes are complaining of not having enough pts cause their trees are so good...<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me explain:<br />
<br />
I play a PvE server, have a perma group hence the prot build (with emphasis on instance encounters) just hit 56 and have re-arranged my trees 3 times testing different things out.<br />
<br />
None of the tier3 skills seems appealing, only one i haven't tested is shield disc, can anyone comment on usefuless of shield disc?  the extra 50% block is decent but considering how shield bash is 12sec refresh, you can only get 1 shot through the 20 sec disc (so big deal about the extra dmg and extra hate from it).  To me it seems a waste of ability such as piercing crap (it does the same purpose as demo shout but doesn't even stack with any stuff that affects mov). <br />
<br />
There's people out there that have extra rage to spare during instances?  Between sunders, demo shouts , the occasional rend, i have trouble keeping up the luxuries such as shield block, battleshouts, so having stuff like piercing crap is just wasted pts not to mention wasted slot.  Meh, maybe i haven't met uber X boss that will rape me if i don't get the 50% extra block for 20sec every 45 sec  :eek: <br />
<br />
But so far, if my best talent build is not having any tier3 at all but taking a bunch of tier2s then it's just sad.  I see all these &quot;defensive&quot; minded trees they built for instances, and see them put pts for MS, and have stuff like 2hspecialize , sweepstrike etc..  I'm sorry but if they ain't wearing a shield then they aren't a prot tank, and that's just wasted pts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways my point is they seriously need to balance out warrior and toss them another bone like why not make shield disc line a PASSIVE skill and modify it a bit?  Why not just a flat further miti of 10% or something, i'll even take 5%, make things useful blah...........<br />
<br />
Shield disc lovers feel free to respond</div></div><hr />

With a weapon that is ~30 dps or higher, I usually have all the rage I want.  You are a bit ahead of me in levels so I'm not sure if you are seeing something different.  From the level 60 warriors in my guild (2 now atm) things sound pretty good at high levels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have trouble keeping up the luxuries such as shield block, battleshouts<br />
<br />
Battleshout isn't really a luxury imo, its pretty much a must have up at all times, its the first thing I spend rage on when charging into battle before switching to defensive(assuming its not up) and if I'm mid battle I never let it drop below 15seconds(GotMoo Buff Mod in Cosmos is a great way to keep track of this without having to hover over your icons).  Battleshout means you're hitting more and doing more damage both of which are rage builders, not to mention the bonus in dps increase to any other melee in your group.  I've found that if you're in a good group that doesn't have to spend lots and lots of time between fights building mana(meaning your healers/nukers don't blow full manabars on trash) then its very easy to keep Battleshout up by chain charging between groupings of mobs.  <br />
<br />
As for shield block, there are only two times I use it 1) when I'm between shield bashes and want to force a Revenge to try and stun a caster 2) when I'm up against a boss thats beating the crap out of me, every little bit helps and if I'm getting the crap beat out of me I usually have rage to spare, especially once all my sunders are in and I just have to toss one out every once in awhile to keep it from fading.  I really noticed a difference chaining shield block on Eranikus winning with a druid/paladin heal team vs the same group's first attempt which was an utter failure wiping at 50%(of course losing one rogue about 20seconds in, the first time I was slept, probably had alot to do with it too).</div></div><hr />

Ok. <br />

Shield discipline is weird. I find it useful for when taking an absolute pummeling and every extra bit helps, but otherwise not very exciting. You can get two shield bashes in though - you use it once to start the 12sec recycle and once when it's finished. The damage is pointless, the aggro is good ( improved shield bash has extremely high aggro to start with, even on immune mobs ).<br />
<br />
 To me it seems a waste of ability such as piercing crap (it does the same purpose as demo shout but doesn't even stack with any stuff that affects mov). <br />
<br />
I use piercing howl constantly, it's one of the few tools for AE trash aggro management, and even when it is insufficient for  holding aggro it allows the mage to kite them some instead of being beat down - also more importantly it lets you chase stuff you lose aggro on, something that is usually extremely difficult due to daze. Also, unlike hamstring, it doesn't require you to be facing the target which makes it extra useful when stuff runs through you.<br />

<br />
What level did you first try Eranikus ? At 51, the 50% extra block was the difference between life and death, and in the trash clearing leading up to him I had rage coming out of every orifice - getting beaten like a redheaded stepchild by 4 elites and 3 trash mobs leaves you with more rage than you know what to do with.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Mortal strike works with a 1hander, and also works in defensive stance. Also, remember that defensive + shield is not always the best approach - for example if you do that vs the zerg in zul'farrak you are basically wasting everyone's time.<br />

Shield discipline, IMO, should be a passive, not activatable, especially given the paladin equivalent. If it's felt that the extra &lt;omg&gt;20&lt;/omg&gt; damage on shield bash and extra aggro is overpowering they could drop it and leave it just as 50% extra block.  10% or 5% extra mitigation is too much though - remember that much as you may wish otherwise, their design decision is to not make it so that the protection tree is required to tank. At even 5% extra mitigation any non protection tank is immediately a second class citizen.</div></div><hr />

I'm mostly arms with some in Prot.  (for improved revenge)  That being said I find the Arms discs awesome so far.  (level 51)  I have all the improved rend ones up to the one that gives you more dmg on your crits.  BIG difference makers imo, when I crit I always bleed the target, and I crit for alot.  I also have improve overpower 2 which is great, 50% chance to cirt.  Improve charge is good for generating rage too.  Dunno, I kind of like our talents. For tanking I do go sword and board, and although not prot specialized, I do have improved revenge which is a darn nice skill imo.</div></div><hr />

Very true .. it should not be required except for the TOUGHEST of bosses, however keep in mind, there has to be SOME reason to take a defensive approach to a warrior, or it's a useless to even have a defensive stance.   THe Survivability HAS to be worth the hit in your outgoing DPS that you take from going defensive/sword and board.<br />
<br />
This time, there is no class issue like there was in EQ.  This time, if you go the defensive route and sacrafice DPS ... YOU CHOSE TO.   If you go DPS, but can't tank as well ... again, YOU CHOSE TO.    It's also why they let you redo your talent's at anytime.....just incase you didn't like your choices.</div></div><hr />
