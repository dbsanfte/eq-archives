<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Biggwinz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Druids Grove Petition (http://pub149.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=31221.topic) <br />
<br />
Now mind you, I dont even consider druids being broken. I will take a druid to an exp group any day. As a mater of fact when I dont feel like looking for someone to fill in I play my druid at the same time.<br />
<br />
So on a class that isnt broken they have 50+ suggestions on how to fix their class!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We really need to come to an agreement and start putting something together and actually stand together and get this fixed.<br />
<br />
I am so tired of the &quot;our class is fine BS&quot; only to see threads all over the place shouting how if you really want to get down to an exp grind pick a Pally or SK. It isnt just warriors either, its the other classes, they know what is going on and see what is happening.<br />
<br />
So while I get to enjoy threads that argue the validity of people solo'ing dragons/nasty mobs, I get to pout over my group members getting their asses kicked daily when we exp.<br />
<br />
My normal exp group is: <br />
Cleric (wife so i can actually see her screen and time taunts for when i know her early heals are going to go off)<br />
Bst (all mssgs on so i can see, &quot;%t loses its fighting edge&quot; and taunt) <br />
Enchanter (so i can see, &quot;%t glances nerviously about&quot; and taunt)<br />
Bard<br />
Rog (a couple early backstabs or bad evades and I am taunting)<br />
ME (the I swear I am not a bad tank, please dont replace me with a knight)<br />
<br />
So we are killing stuff and this is how most pulls go<br />
Inc...<br />
Get to camp<br />
Start killing it<br />
Enc and Bst start casting<br />
I see tash mssg<br />
I see slow mssg<br />
Taunt<br />
/assist<br />
/shield<br />
/tell BST Dont move I am shielding you!<br />
/target Mob<br />
/taunt<br />
/disarm<br />
/kick<br />
/pray I get some procs<br />
Hopefully I have it's attention by now (but not always do I)<br />
Fight and pray the cleric doesnt get aggro on a heal<br />
If she does I am USELESS, I have already used my /shield on the bst so in order for us to get the mob of our cleric the BST cast slow and I end up pulling the mob off of the BST once more.<br />
<br />
I am a second rank tank, not because of my skills and not because of my hps/migration but because I am not a tank if I am not tanking, I am nothing but a semi ok melee!<br />
<br />
So if you managed to get this far... my suggestion is the taunt button working 95% of the time, period. I want this far greater than anything else.<br />
<br />
My reasons behind taunt working as my most wanted are as follows:<br />
<br />
Pally and SK can already grab aggro at will.<br />
Chain Snares or Chain stuns works everytime, low health aggro excluded<br />
This ability should be inate (we have a TAUNT BUTTON for goodness sake)<br />
Taunt is on a pretty good refresh rate as it is.<br />
Giving taunt 95% still allows for failures that would relate to knights failures<br />
The only Outstanding difference between us and knights are our migration and defensive disc. (dps, hps and ac are all VERY close)<br />
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO TANK WITH OUT WORRYING ABOUT PROCS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/nod<br />
<br />
I had a helluva time in Torment last night till we got a shammy. Without Focus I wasn't proc'n much at all and the rest of the group got the shiznit kicked out of them. As soon as I got Focus however the agro was all mine.<br />
<br />
It would be nice to have some control over agro, and not be entirely dependent on procs (and  therefore the random number generator).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would like to see, in no particular order of importance:<br />
<br />
1) a much better taunt success rate<br />
2) more innate HP's ... not due to AA<br />
3) better innate mitigation/avoidance ... not due to AA's<br />
<br />
In my opinion this would help balance the Tank classes ... pure tanking ability of the War vs. the added utility of the Knights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Considering the fact that after the druid's grove petition Absor posted and said specifically that petitions were not a good way to send suggestions and that it would be more productive for individuals to use e-mail and /feedback in game with their suggestions, I don't think this would be real worthwhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Biggwinz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you have the email addy?<br />
<br />
This wasnt exactly a petition but more along the lines of knock of the stupid bickering and lets get something done!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">eqfeedback@soe.sony.com allegedly goes straight to Absor.  <br />
<br />
You can also type /feedback in game and get a window to send in your ideas.  <br />
<br />
At the last Fan Faire they said that /feedbacks and the feedback e-mails do get read and that it was a more effective way to reach sony than message board griping.  Of course you can choose whether or not to believe that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Garoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not sure if this has been mentioned how about having taunt be affected by haste ? with the advent of Spell haste I , II , III , IV , and EE I-IV, Extended Range I-IV,  and yet we get nothing but a few skill points to do our job better, ohh and cant forget /shield dam we're over powered with /shield. hasting taunt could cut our recycle in half, essentialy doubling our chances at maybe getting a sucessful taunt.<br />
<br />
And HAHA yeah Thord I was in Torment last night also, jeez before I got a bard in group I was back to using my red epic to get more aggro procs, before I could see the message &quot;mob_01 glances nervously about&quot; it was gone and eating my ENCH.  when I seen &quot;Mob_01 slows down&quot; that was it I was /sheilding and playing rogue while the ENCH tanked. <br />
what a fun night for 10% xp for four hours, if the xp is going to suck so bad they really need to make it easier to do while doing it.<br />
At least I got the next drop for my Clockwork Talismen WooHoo!<br />
And empty Servitor of Saryrn corpses &quot;what not a single thing on it ?!? &quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe include an invitation to discuss these concerns on this board.<br />
<br />
Krag</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">just a couple of comments on your set up pull style bigg. <br />
<br />
i dont get the impression that the sham/ench was waiting any length of time before tash/slow. 3-5 secs of solo time i find is always invaluable, epcially if u have 2 proccers and 1 procs.<br />
<br />
also, re ur use of shield, i note you use /assist then /shield. <br />
<br />
personally im not a big fan of doing things this way, as by /assist - u lose ur target for a couple of secs to shield and thats a couple of secs of lost DPS.<br />
<br />
i find it better to set a hotkey to the slower/ench/cleric - <br />
<br />
/shield *insertname*, that way you can shield and not lose target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fvighlander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't like having specific hotkeys to /shield one person, however, I also do not put /assist in my shield key...<br />
<br />
I just hit the appropriate F key to target the member of my group who is getting rocked, hit my /shield key, and then hit ~ (mapped on my settings to the &quot;toggle target&quot; key they added a few patches ago) to get back on the mob. I lose maybe one round of combat as long as the person I'm trying to shield is in range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Could one of the more experienced warriors come up with a standard e-mail basically addressing our concerns and include some ideas of possible fixes we could all e-mail to Absor. If enough of us did this maybe we would finally get listened to. <br />
<br />
Not a bad idea, tho I am rather cynical about our chances any more.  Several good ideas have that I have especially liked are adding hate to kick/slams, double taunt, and Furor's hate DoT ability idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Biggwinz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You are correct sham/ench are not waiting, seeing how the fights rarely last more than a minute it is stupid to have to wait. Part of the whole point of that scenerio is the fact that we shouldnt have to wait. Knights dont have to, why should we lose our DPS while we &quot;gain&quot; aggro!<br />
<br />
Then with /assist, /pause 2 and /shield I lose a whole 2 tenths of a second. Which in my opinion is way more valueable than accidently grabing the wrong group member on accident.<br />
<br />
Since it is a known fact that I dont have the ability to grab aggro on demand the bst, enc and cleric tend to huddle together so the mob is not jumping all over the place.<br />
<br />
Then to top it all off with all three in the same place it does not make it easy to tell exactly which person the mop is pissed at. So if I accidently click the wrong /shield XXX person, I just wasted my /shield.<br />
<br />
I used to have /shield XXX buttons but one mistake can really suck :( <br />
<br />
On raids I still use /shield XXX buttons for those known to get aggro :)<br />
<br />
(I hope that came across as valid reasons and not just some dont tell me what to do arguement)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aveen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Brutal, even though you have some valid points. I would like you to show where in the past warriors have gotten anything through their attepts to massively send in email or /feedbacks.<br />
<br />
We are being ignored at all levels. <br />
<br />
A petition is not the best solution, it is not the solution absor would have us take, however, please name a method that we haven't not tried with failed success. <br />
<br />
We are running out of options to get our points accross to Absor and the dev team. I think it is time for our self appointed leaders, the moderators of this message board, Glatius, Froodlin, and a few others who have been vigoursly fighting for the cause to make a petition. <br />
<br />
When all other methods have failed, is that not the time to resort to the less scrupulous methoeds of combat?<br />
<br />
We are warriors and it is about time we threw down the gauntlet and showed our war faces.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Elemental legs have begun dropping in the plane of time.  I'm absolutely certain beyond a shadow of a doubt that it wasn't because of someone using /feedback or E-Mail but was the result of a messageboard thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Biggwinz, I'm right with you in principle.  A couple of comments though:<br />
<br />
Taunt is no use as a routine means of getting aggro for tanking, because it only works once you've already lost aggro to someone else.  It's designed for emergencies and mostly that's what it's good for.<br />
<br />
A special attack that you could use once per mob to let you get enough aggro to get you through slows would help more.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing suggestions to give taunt a 98% success rate, or give every kick double stun aggro etc are about as likely to be listened to by Sony as druids asking for 90% rez and translocates.<br />
<br />
They also tend to bin form e-mails by the way, if what I hear is true.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes that is currently how it is! It needs to be fixed! Why can we not have the exact same aggro abilities as Knights???? (Which is a hybrid of US, warriors, and another class)<br />
<br />
I don’t care what you call it but our taunt needs to be changed so we can pull aggro the same way, rate and reliability as Knights!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">One thing we can't hope for on this expansion:<br />
<br />
HP and mitigation boost. Stop asking for it, we won't get it.<br />
If they for some reason did give use those boosts, they would have to retune all of PoP fit the Main Tanking thingy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wish for what you can get:<br />
<br />
Aggro is still a possibility even if it makes a few encounters a tiny bit easier.<br />
<br />
New skills.<br />
<br />
Better itemisation.<br />
<br />
Better AAs.<br />
<br />
Better Discs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's a aa i'd like to see ;)  (this is just a wish heh, doubt it would ever go in anyhow)<br />
<br />
<br />
Godly:<br />
--------------------<br />
Warrior assumes the Daemon form.<br />
Warrior's Attk/AC/HP/Dmg is multiplied by 5.<br />
<br />
The warrior having aquired unnatural abilities becomes a stranger to his fellow guildies. He is thus tagged NPC and cannot be healed or buffed.<br />
<br />
This ability lasts 1minute.<br />
<br />
<br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
woowoo, fun :)<br />
Ofcourse theres balance issues to be looked into, and tune it a bit (edit: ya, dmg x 5 may be a bit overpowered ;p).. . But I would just like to see that one day ;)<br />
<br />
Sure theres the HP and AC increase that &quot;could&quot; unbalance certain fights..<br />
but with the &quot;not being able to get healed&quot;, it makes a nice secondary effect.<br />
(Or you could just have the mob ignore the warrior like DA, in which case in Raid situations, the ability would only give DPS)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Other then that, we definately need to do something.<br />
And I doubt they read every email people send, Ill try feed back and email myself, but it will probably just get brushed aside ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You're missing the point there pal.<br />
<br />
Adding items doesn't fix warriors.  The blade of carnage, bloodfrenzy, Hategiver and blade of war are all fine weapons, YET THEY DO NOT HELP 99% OF THE WARRIOR POPULATION IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM.<br />
<br />
Adding AA's doesn't fix warriors.  Lower level warriors experience the same issues that level 60+ warriors do.  They shouldn't be left in the cold to say &quot;Well, get to 60 and get some AA's then.&quot;  That's a crap solution to a long standing crappy issue.<br />
<br />
Improving the success rate on taunt won't fix warriors.  We're still just as likely to lose aggro with a 100% taunt button as we are without one.  It does nothing except make the next 6 seconds go by a lot easier.<br />
<br />
Adding disciplines doesn't fix warriors.  All warriors have heard since Kunark is about how we're better tanks because of our &quot;3 Minutes of Glory.&quot;  We heard it from monks, and every goddamned one of us KNOWS they tanked better than us.  We heard it from Paladins and SK's, and the situation is the same now.  Disciplines won't do crap for warriors except make it so we're less useless.<br />
<br />
What WILL fix warriors is a HP/Mitigation boost like we're supposed to have (except itemization is fucked) and an aggro generation skill of our own (Taunt generates no aggro, it merely repositions it).<br />
<br />
Warriors were fine when we TANKED BETTER than knights.  You could choose a knight and know you were getting a guy who wasn't quite as good as a warrior, but he had some utility, and he could do the job.  Right now, due to itemization, Knights have near the same HP and near the same AC, so there is NO BONUS to being a warrior at all.  Period, end of discussion.   Put us back on top of the heap by a sizable amount (like we should be) and you fix the problem.  You can tiptoe around aggro for a better tank, or you can pick the Knight who can hold aggro and heal him more often.  That's the way it was originally intended, and that's the way it needs to return to.<br />
<br />
If that's not acceptable, then go with the skills Furor suggested on this board.  We need a way to generate our own aggro thru another means other than relying on randomness of procs and DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Not sure if this is a good idea or not but maybe they might think about giving us a partial Damage bonus on our offhand as a warrior only skill.<br />
  Cap it at a small number say 10 or so as the highest damage bonus we can get on our off hand... <br />
    I am just guessing at this as I have not done near the crunching of numbers alot of you guys have done.<br />
 I do think that this slight increase would still not overdo our DPS but still give us a chance at maintaining decent aggro,<br />
  but then again as far as the upper end weapons of the game go this might just make them need to retune encounters for raids.<br />
  We would still be Second rate DPS, but with our proccs and taunt we would still have a much better chance at aggro.<br />
  Just a idea I thought I would throw out there for Discussion.<br />
<br />
Daldomer Aleslayer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">First of all, I wasn merely listing what we could get.<br />
<br />
And we lack in so many places, if not all places.<br />
<br />
<br />
One thing i don't want for warriors, is snap aggro.<br />
That's paladins, they have snap aggro, leave it to them.<br />
<br />
What we need is something different, but just as effective.<br />
It's harder coming up with such things rather then just saying &quot;Fix our taunt!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Furor's idea is awseome for that, it's not snap aggro, but it gives us an advantage.<br />
(and like Frodlin said, it could bring in the Multiple tanking aspect)<br />
<br />
Now that is something i'd like to see:<br />
<br />
Knights having unbeatable aggro on ONE target.<br />
<br />
Warriors having unbeatable tankage on multiple targets.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's a couple ideas I came up with while trying to sleep last night. (drank too much redbull before going to bed ;) )<br />
<br />
=========<br />
<br />
Discouraging Cry: (name sucks, find a better one plz)<br />
--------------------------------<br />
This Skill &quot;casts&quot; a pb aoe Attk debuff.<br />
The mobs within range all have their attack greatly diminished for a certain amount of time.<br />
Allowing group members experience very low damage on uncontrolled mobs.<br />
<br />
Duration: 30 seconds<br />
Reuse time: 10minutes<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
<br />
answer to our aggro problems:<br />
<br />
Tame Weapon:<br />
theres two versions of this idea, the first one is my favorite one, but probably too complicated.<br />
--------------------------------<br />
After many challenges and victories together, the Warrior has demystified all aspects of his companions of war. <br />
He can now tame his weapons, and make them execute orders at will.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tame Weapon (a):<br />
----<br />
Duration: 24 hours<br />
Reuse time : 24 hours<br />
<br />
When used, this skill creates a hotbutton called &quot;Channel&quot;(or whatever the name).<br />
The new skill &quot;channel&quot; has the effect of the primary weapon which was equipped at this time.<br />
<br />
The Hotbutton Channel has a reuse time of 20 seconds.<br />
<br />
The Hotbutton &quot;Channel&quot; allows the warrior to cast his weapon's Combat effect.<br />
---<br />
<br />
So basically, every 24 hours, you can put whichever weapon you wish in primary, and use the skill.<br />
You will then be granted a 20 second reuse skill with that weapon's effect.<br />
Meanwhile, you can change the weapon in primary, yet keep the same effect.<br />
<br />
This will keep the warrior's aggro low then the paladin's, yet controllable.<br />
It gives the warrior choices in weaponry.<br />
(Either you go all EB, for maximal aggro capacity.<br />
Or you can go all dps, with DD/dot procing weapons, and rely on 20seconds EB uses).<br />
<br />
<br />
========<br />
<br />
Tame Weapon(b):<br />
as much as I like the first idea, it may be too complicated, so here's a simpler skill but less attractive.<br />
<br />
Reuse of 20 seconds.<br />
<br />
When used, this skill forces your primary to proc on the next Round.<br />
<br />
===========<br />
<br />
Now here is a simple but potentially effective skill.<br />
<br />
Headblow:<br />
a simple single target mem blur.<br />
<br />
Reuse of 20 seconds.<br />
<br />
(use a Kick right after and you save your shaman/enchanter/slackwitzard) :p<br />
<br />
=============<br />
<br />
Since warriors are becoming more and more like the average Raid Target mobs. (they Flurry and Rampage)<br />
<br />
Why not make Warriors of a certain level go Enraged everytime they are at 5% hp or below :p<br />
<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
This is a personal thing, but I wouldn't like seeing warriors just get a skill that you can use every 6 seconds like Taunt, but gets you perfect aggro.<br />
<br />
I'd much prefer seeing a palette of skills you have to carefully choose from. Because you won't be able to spam that skill.<br />
<br />
Perhaps use AE taunt this time... and keep that aggro snap skill for the next few mobs.<br />
Will the next pull be a single or multi pull though?.. perhaps I should keep AE taunt till then...<br />
or would Discouraging blow suffice? hmm...<br />
choices choices...<br />
Warriors could them be divided betweem those that know their shit,<br />
and those that have average tanking skills ;).</div></div><hr />

That's paladins, they have snap aggro, leave it to them.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Why do people believe this, and perpetuate this line of thought?<br />
<br />
This amazes me. Who made Paladins the GODS of Taunt?<br />
<br />
There is no logical reason why warriors should be the red-headed step-child of taunt.</div></div><hr />

If it's snap aggro you really want. Why not make a paladin???<br />
<br />
Sure warriors need better aggro, no one is denying it.<br />
<br />
But I for one, don't want to be a paladin with a tiny bit more hp, and no spells.<br />
<br />
I want to be a warrior.</div></div><hr />

One thing we can't hope for on this expansion:<br />
<br />
HP and mitigation boost. Stop asking for it, we won't get it.<br />
If they for some reason did give use those boosts, they would have to retune all of PoP fit the Main Tanking thingy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What?<br />
<br />
Does not a 6khp Warrior Trivialize Trakanon? (Velious)<br />
What about 7k? (Luclin)<br />
What about 9k? (PoP)<br />
<br />
Can not Classes Now Solo Formerly Major mobs like Lodizal, VS etc? Is that not Trivial?<br />
<br />
When 6 people Kill Dragons that used to take raids (Klandicar/Zlandicar) is that not trivial?<br />
<br />
When 12 people kill the AoW, is that trivial?<br />
<br />
What about 30 people for the Emperor of SSRA?<br />
<br />
When VT used to take 3 long days to clear and Now can be done in a fraction of the time? Is that trivial?<br />
<br />
When the first kills of Tier 1 bosses took full  raids, and now are done by 30 people is that Trivial?<br />
<br />
Progression Will always make the game trivial....<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Giving warriors 25% extra HP's or 25% more Mitigation will that make it trivial?<br />
<br />
No... If A Tank has 12,000 hps as compared to 10,000hps now when they get hit by mobs that do 2500 a swing, and can hit 4 times a rund and riposte, you use a 2 sec CH chain.. combining 25% mit and 25%more hps.. lets say at best that gives a combined 50% boost of MT durability, that CH chain becomes 3 sec as compared to 2 sec? Is that Trivialization?<br />
<br />
Giving Warriors More DPS will that make it trivial?<br />
<br />
No...Monks, Rogues, Rangers, Casters all do more DPS than us already. No one uses a warrior to deal damage, but damage is currently our ONLY form of innate aggro  generation, therefore we need more... if we up average  DPS from 150 to 200, that means in a 3 minute fight we do what?  9000 pts of damage? so in 3 minutes we would do as much as a caster with 2 nukes... Thats sure trivial...<br />
<br />
Giving warriors 'snap aggro' will that make it trivial?<br />
No...<br />
If Warriors had snap aggro, it would be on demand, meaning we would have to REACT to losing aggro. what does this mean? It means that the big mob has turned and SWUNG at the overaggrooing caster.. now if that mob hits for 2400 and can double or quad or proc, that over aggroing caster is now paste most likely. They die regardless, and we get aggro back as sooon as they die. What does this mean to warriors however? Snap aggro means we CAN be effective EXP tanks were the mobs dont usually one round casters... Does this trivialize anything? makes a tank switch easier, but aoe taunt already does this effectively.<br />
<br />
Giving warriors a range on taunt or taunt that works, will that make it trivial?<br />
No...<br />
For all of the above reasons this just allows us to do our job, that we were supposed to be able to do in the first place.<br />

I have a question.<br />
If it's snap aggro you really want. Why not make a paladin???<br />
 <br />
<br />
I thought Paladins were Holy Warriors?<br />
<br />
Their spells are designed primarilly vs Undead, they get slay undead, they can heal and cure people, they can rez the dead. <br />
<br />
Why do people look at this class, and all they see is 'OHHH SNAPP AGGRO!'<br />
<br />
Snap aggro from STUN is supposed to be a DRAWBACK to the spell. The spell was not designed to lock down aggro. the spell was designed to save someone by preventing the mob from beating the piss out of them. Not make the mob your ever loving friend.<br />
<br />
This class does have its utility, abilities, spells and specializations. They are in all sense and puerposes a warrior WITH spells and abilities. <br />
<br />
I challenge you to name us one class ability that is as usefull as a paladins spells and abilities...<br />
<br />
Aoe Taunt, Shield, Defensive are what you will say... To that i say these are like pissing into a hurricane, sure it may feel good, you may even get some relief doing it, but does it do any good?<br />
<br />
Is there  any reason for anyone to ever get a warrior over a paladin? The very very few high end encounters where the DPS is so insane that you must use defensive?<br />
<br />
IMHO, DEFENSIVE is the WORST thing ever to happen to warriors. They Fucked up with itemization and mitigation for warriors and the KNEW it, did they fix it? NO they gave us defensive. A DISCIPLINE WTF, this should be a warrior SKILL, we should already HAVE this ability, it should not just be a 54+ discipline that defines our class...<br />
<br />
Followed close as the second Worst thing to ever happen to warriors is ENRAGING BLOW Weapons, by default, this is the only way now that a warrior can be seen to be effective, if they do not have an EB weapon other classes percieve them as effective tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Landrain, <br />
I'm saying do not hope for HP upgrades for THIS expansion.<br />
Do you even read my posts? or just see that i'm against Snap Aggro and quickly make a reply without thouroughly reading???<br />
<br />
1)I agree with you that warriors need something done.<br />
<br />
2)HP upgrades are Reserved to expansions, because it makes an unbalance in the current expansion. And you can't have PoP things become trivial when PoP is the only expansion with the raid conent!<br />
So until next Raid content oriented Expansion, DONT hope for any HP upgrades.<br />
<br />
3)Whatever the paladins were designed FOR has no importance whatsoever....<br />
what is important is what they are doing NOW.<br />
<br />
Paladins have earned a spot in the game where they are a Tank with better aggro management.<br />
<br />
We can very well keep it that way, and find interesting solutions to make warriors a better TANK.<br />
<br />
Right now:<br />
Our aggro sucks WAY too much, it definately needs to be upgraded.<br />
<br />
Our advantage in tanking is WAY too small. It also needs upgrading.. but NOT via HP and AC boosts.<br />
<br />
things like group skills, (Discouraging Cry)<br />
or whatever you can think of.<br />
<br />
With the coming of LDoN, dungeon crawls becoming a MUST, these skills could prove extremely interesting.<br />
Where they could organise fights where no longer you wait while a single pull comes and then just taunt that thing...<br />
<br />
but where waves come, the warrior has to not only tank but help keep the group alive.<br />
(AE taunt, Rampage already becoming handy. Add in other skills that make ius a Tank that stands out.)<br />
<br />
If we just get snap aggro,<br />
ill just make a paladin then. Almost same thing, except I can solo, slay undead, root, rez, heal, buff.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Yes I do read messages you write...<br />
<br />
The AoE Defensive skill? Silly and would be a discipline. We dont need disciplines.<br />
<br />
The Tame Weapon skill? That would make all proc weapons a right click effect. This still requires us to rely on procs, albeit a 20 sec delay here.. but still need the EB weapon, etc etc...<br />
<br />
Warriors need help.<br />
<br />
The state of the game right now....<br />
<br />
Boss Mob Warrior needed to tank...<br />
Trash Mobs, anyone can tank, SK,Pal,War<br />
Exp Mobs prefered Knight, but anyone with aggro lock, ie knight/rng/bst can tank. Seen Rangers tank Giants in BoT...<br />
<br />
Why do we tank Boss mobs? Defensive... <br />
Basically there is no need for more than 3 warriors, and even then, thats if you are chain pulling BoSS Mobs. <br />
<br />
Warriors are a one trick pony. We have defensive. In order for us to do our job EVERYONE ELSE must slow down anbd accomodate us. I would say we ride the short bus at SoE, but I think it just passed us by.<br />
<br />
To take a line from a Kurt Russell in 'Soldier'<br />
Your men are obsolete....<br />
<br />
As Warriors... we are obsolete...<br />
<br />
The sooner people stop denying this and we get together as one.. <br />
<br />
We can try to get this fixxed..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I absolutely agree, we are obsolete.<br />
I don't get how people can still say theres not problem with warriors, everything is fine....<br />
Even other classes are starting to feel sorry for us heh...<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't see why the AoE skill would need to be a discipline...<br />
<br />
You make all the mobs around you hurt less for a while... sort of like casting Tugur's Insects :p<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the Tame Weapon,<br />
it gives us a control over aggro, which we wish for.<br />
But relies on weapons you hold...<br />
wouldn't it be logic though? a Warrior with better weapons holding aggro better?<br />
<br />
<br />
People keep saying we should do something, but seems no one is doing anything o_O.<br />
<br />
I'll write a personal e-mail, even if it gets brushed aside, i would of at least tried.<br />
But would be nice if we could have a thread discussing solely on a wishlist.<br />
Having everyone dump ideas... we could then trim and narrow them all into a list digestible for Alan.<br />
<br />
I'd rather we discuss all ideas, before i even send my email.<br />
I know people tend to love their own ideas, and see it to be obviously a great idea!... but they overlook things.<br />
<br />
I know i've overlooked things on ideas, (even if to me theyre Awseome ideas ;p )<br />
So please, <br />
let's make a wishlist.<br />
And moderate the hell out of it. Keeping the fecking &quot;But we are balaanced, im uber and can hold aggro sooo easily&quot; lines out of it :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Things I see that need work...<br />
<br />
HP's - we have no longer a signifigant class advantage in this over other classes period.<br />
<br />
Mitigation - We have no advantage overall over other tank classes.<br />
<br />
DPS- We are now very close to on par, with other tankl classes, we are behind SK, above Pal.. but the disparity is not any advantage.<br />
<br />
AGGRO - No snap aggro ability at all<br />
<br />
AGGRO - Ability to maintain aggro is weak, ie taunt.<br />
<br />
AGGRO - Ability to AGGRO LOCK - does not exist, and i think none of us really want this. But being able to maintain aggro during EXP groups is a must in order to compete with knights for group spots.<br />
<br />
Taunt - we would like a message saying this works/fails.<br />
<br />
Taunt - the range on this is pitiful. can we add range or  scale range up?<br />
<br />
Disciplines - Unhook the timers<br />
<br />
Itemization - can we get some more warrior items that really help us?  ALL/ALL items are one thing that has caused such high mudflation.<br />
<br />
New Combat Skills - having something besides taunt/kick/disarm -<br />
<br />
New Aggro abilities - Furors dotaunt idea, this needs explored, may ways this can be done.<br />
<br />
Combat Focuses! - Why do these not exist? Look at all the caster focuses, I am sure we can come up with things that can fill this category.<br />
<br />
RELIGION! I was a heretic, I have found religion! Or I forsake my religion. For all classes except DIVINE casters, I do not understand why this cannot be done. It should be available as aone time feature just like /surname.<br />
<br />
Weapon Specializations - Whene a warrior reachs level 60 they get to choose One Specialization. They can go into this mode at any time. There is no reset time, or time limit for usage. It is toggled on or off. I think only one specialization should ever be chosen, I do think maybe a quest to Guildmaster in PoP to change the specialization at a future time may be ok..<br />
<br />
Lets see.. I know most of these are pipe dreams... but its fun to think..<br />
<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
Weapon/Shield style - This style allows you to do an auto Bash whenever you would normally dual wield. This bash would use the AC of the shield as the dam/delay - this bash does not affect the BASH timer. <br />
<br />
2HS/Shield style - This style allows you to wield a 2hs weapon along with a shield.<br />
<br />
Dual Wield style - This style gives secondary weapon a damage bonus. It also gives a bonus to the Dual Wield skill.<br />
<br />
Archer style - archery skill cap 250 - this style gives warriors the ranger damage table with bows, along with the double damage bonus, only usable in light armor<br />
<br />
StreetFighter - Piercing skill cap 250 - allows backstab ability , only usable in light armor<br />
<br />
Brawler - H2H skill cap 250 - gives warriors some of the Monk special attacks ie Dragon Punch, only usable in light armor.<br />
<br />
Knight - Piercing skill cap 250- gives warriors double damage when using a 2HP weapon from a mount. <br />
<br />
Fencer- Piercing cap 250, Ripost 250, Parry 250, Dodge 250- Only usable in light armor <br />
<br />
=========================================<br />
Hehe, ok enough ideas here... maybe this could be a start for a comprehensive proposal?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>mahalito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Maybe the answer is to the problem with war vs. hybrids could be solved another way.  Instead of a hugde boost to AC/Midigation/HP or an all out nerf on hybrids, just adjust both a little.  This would make the warrior clearly better, without drastically changing any one class.<br />
<br />
1.) all this luclin and later plate gear that all has brain stats as well as hp could be adjusted via class.  Ex bracer ac 12, hp 20, mana 20 could be ac 14 hp 30 when worn by warrior.<br />
<br />
2.) Increase warrior midigation 10%, decrease hybrid 10%<br />
<br />
3.) Atcuall AC received from items is 1.6 x ac value.  Make warriors 1.7 and hybrids 1.5<br />
<br />
4.) Dont waste time worrying about more /disc we cant use the ones we have now cause if we do, means we cant use defensive if necessary and frankly the rest suck anyway.<br />
<br />
5.) Fix the way agro getting/holding thing of warriors vs hybrids , not going to explain what i mean here ,we all know.(admitidly i have no clue how, but i figure SoE had people smart enough to invent, market, and run this game for years, surely they can come up with something reasonable). Something here clearly needs to be done, it's bad and getin worse every expansion.<br />
<br />
By doing little t hings like this, it can better seperate the warrior from the hybrid in terms of tanking ability.  Remember hybrids can do lots more so just slightly reducing their effectivenss in order to acheive better game ballance wont effect any of their other abilites.  Tankin is the ONLY thing warriors can do, they should be without question the frist class that comes to mind when a tank is looked for.  If you need a rez, you shout for a cleric, but if a cleric aint around you'd take a pally rez, it's the same thing.<br />
<br />
One last thing i saw this line earlier in this thread<br />
<br />
&quot;Paladins have earned a spot in the game where they are a Tank with better aggro management.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is the biggest load of crap i have ever heard.  Pally's have earned nothing, it has all been handed to them.  With the way the ballance has slowely shifted to the point it is today where pallys have the clear advantage, a pally would have to be a damn moron not to be able to tank better, assuming same lvl, similar equipment ect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>BrikBludgaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Warrior should NOT be the only class you think of when you think of tank...  people like you are the reason why every hybrid has to battle so bitterly against the &quot;we should be gods&quot; warriors.<br />
<br />
the knights should be viable alternatives...  the knights and warriors should each have benefits and downsides...  A party choosing between a warrior and a knight should be looking at their party and trying to see which benefits/downsides are most beneficial t the party... the answer should not always be an easy one.<br />
<br />
The largest issue warriors face is that of MAINTAINING aggro.<br />
<br />
Taunt works surprisingly well with HYBRID caps (60-70% insta snap aggro with hybrid caps and a warrior useable 2H weapon... this is against yellow-white and nearly even con blue mobs in PoFire.<br />
<br />
warriors have issues KEEPING aggro once they have it.<br />
<br />
all warriors need is an ability that allows them to add numerical hate consistently. (add +hate equal to lvl*3 to every KICK whether it hits or misses)<br />
<br />
<br />
Knights carved out a niche in the uber aggro department when they had NO OTHER ROLE.  Much in the way monks carved out a role in pulling in their mastery and study of pulling.  ANY other class can pull... but most monks study it very closely... <br />
Knights and indeed all hybrids have ways of studying aggro that warriors simply CANNOT EVER match.<br />
<br />
Shadowknights in particular now have spells that actually add NUMERICAL hate.  What warrior exists that can cast numerical hate at mobs and study +hate like a shadowknight?  What warrior can claim such knowledge or ability for long-term study and practice?  The answer is simple...  only a warrior who also owns a Dread Lord and who plays them as much as those that call themselves Shadowknights...<br />
<br />
That would be a VERY select group.<br />
<br />
Want to know about the absolute BEST information about MTing on a raid?  Want to know how to best tank The rathe council?  Do a search on the warrior board.  Want to know how to best split a pair of very-hard-to-split mobs?  Look on the monk boards.  Want to know the best way to piss off a mob?  Check the knight boards.<br />
<br />
Pallies and indeed ALL knights who paid 140% experience and who STILL pay 10% more than every warrior deserve to be at least as useful as every warrior.  Different is fine...  but you cannot have all the knights' strengths and all of yours too...<br />
<br />
its called balance...  that which most of the whining warriors wouldnt know one iota about.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, I would see warriors grow in their abilities for consistent +hate generation...  I would also like to see knights more useful in the raid tanking role...  balance is a double-edged sword.<br />
<br />
Brik</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Uh brik, gaining aggro over the slower/debuffer is the problem, maintaining aggro once you have a handle on it is less of an issue and in any case you can generally get it back... it's the massive differential in initial aggro generation between knights and warriors - and the fact it requires other people to generate hate before taunt does anything - that most messes up the balance. As warriors who are designed to tank as our one and only function I think it's perfectly reasonable to expect to be first choice for that role, that certainly doesn't mean that knights can't fill that role and fill it well. What we need is a way to persuade people to have more than one tank in a group not the cockermamy situation where knights are exp tanks because we can hit defensive on raids.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">&quot;The largest issue warriors face is that of MAINTAINING aggro.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wrong.  Once I have aggro I generally keep it.  The problem is getting INITIAL aggro after slow is done.<br />
<br />
&quot;all warriors need is an ability that allows them to add numerical hate consistently.&quot;<br />
<br />
If it was enough to overcome initial slow aggro then I would agree.<br />
<br />
&quot;Knights carved out a niche in the uber aggro department when they had NO OTHER ROLE.&quot;<br />
<br />
Knights used to be broken.  Pretty much everyone admits that.  They used to have far less hps, ac, mitigation, and damage output than warriors did.  They could draw aggro at will, but nobody wanted them too because they couldn't tank worth a crap.  They have since been upgraded to the point where their HPs, ac, mitigation, and damage output ranges from slightly below to slightly above a warrior in similar gear.  Knights are now essentially warriors with spells.  The only real advantage a warrior has is defensive and that is of very questionable use in an xp group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I am a 65 warrior... Ihave EB weapons, BOC, I have JSOFF, I have the FB4 shield.... In an EXP situation, I cannot find a group. If I do, the entire group has to compensate for my lack of positive aggro control. If I dont proc, or not often enough, I will loose aggro. <br />
<br />
I am also a 58 Shaman, yesterday I logged on because we had no raids, ergo I could not get an exp group as my warrior, so The shaman logged on, and dont you know I goy 3 offers in 20 seconds...  <br />
<br />
So I go with a group of guildmates, all 65 BTW to farm some stuff. cleric, druid,sk, shaman... BTW the druid is the one we call our guild-summonee she gets summoned all the time on raids. A sort of comic relief.<br />

So we start pulling mobs on incomming I start casting.. I malosi/slow/dot/dot/epic/dot.../sit <br />
<br />
needless to say the entire day I never got summoned, I never got aggro. I cast till OOM, and this is with FT5, Drogmar, PoT9, SP, KEI... For a shaman, thats a lot of casting...<br />
<br />
I NEVER Got aggro.. not once, not even when the mob resisted Turgurs 4 times, Malosi 3 times, Plague of Insects 2 times, before plague then turgurs landed... Thats 9 resists! If I was on my warrior, 1 resist is enough for the mob to start running for the shaman...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Bazzal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I started my war Bazzal as my very first EQ character before starting up my main Zanp the mage that I taken to level 65 and as many AA.<br />
<br />
And there two things I noticed while playing when fast pulling xp group with my mage. Wars just can’t tank. It not got any thing to do with HP or mitigation but with the fact I will be the one getting hit if I cast a spell at all before the mob hits 80% health and good forbid I cast two spells in a row or get a big crit. Having a war try and tank cuts my mages damage my 40% to 60% depending on the Wars equipment. <br />
<br />
As a war trying to play in a fast pulling group I can’t tank the mobs are just ping pinging all over the place. And if the group gives me a few seconds to get agro the clerics going to have to waste mana on heals while I tank an unslowed mobs that can’t be slowed “without pulling agro off me and starting the pin pong of death” till I have agro.<br />
<br />
It is quite frankly it is a bad a joke.<br />
<br />
I have my own idea for fixing warrior agro and group desirability.<br />
<br />
First of we have to spells so why the hell don’t we have a nice big MR as a innate ability we have no need to be sensitive to magic just so we can cast spells.<br />
That has been a pet hate for a long time.<br />
<br />
Second agro <br />
<br />
As was said before we don’t want a just press this and you have agro button but a nice set of skills that you need to pick and choose from to do the job.<br />
<br />
But backing that set of skills up I think a scaling hate bonuses in line with the damage bonuses would help a hell of a lot. <br />
<br />
For example and please forgive the numbers it only to show the idea<br />
<br />
As it is now If any class hits with a weapon for 50 damage if add 5 points to the hate list.<br />
<br />
My idea would be to have a warrior that hits with the same weapon for the same 50 points of damage would get 7.5 points of agro I.E. 1.5x5 points of agro.<br />
<br />
You could have the Agro modifier scale with the level on the war or even add it as a line of agro focus items for warriors only. Hell SOE could even add these new items into the sales pitch for there next new expansion. <br />
<br />
My point being that a warrior will have a better chance of holding agro over the rest off the party just so long as he/she is given a chance to get it, and to help get agro quicker. It still not the snap agro of SK and plandins but would help a group keep the dps up and still use a warrior as the tank.<br />
<br />
Again please forgive the numbers but I hope you can understand what I mean.<br />
<br />
I think it just stupid that in BoT last night with my mage we used a well equipped beastloard with over 7k hp to tank becouse he could/would keep agro over the level 65 war that was lfg while adding very good dps and actually being easier on the clerics mana that the well equipped level 65 plandin he replaced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Aanya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I've suggested this before, but warriors should have &quot;Voice of Nightmares&quot; (the thing SK's get as a spell) as an innate ability. It would solve a lot of our problems in exp groups since everything we do then generates more aggro than someone who doesnt have this effect.<br />
<br />
Its easy, and it would work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>mahalito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">someone earlier said <br />

So balance ya say...well ....<br />
<br />
Warriors<br />
<br />
Tank<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Pally<br />
<br />
Tank,melee buff(65 pally has same buffs as my 55 clericbot),rez pretty much as good as a cleric(diff between 90 and 96 aint much), CC abilites via root, stun ect, awsome group heal which also doubles as AoE taunt, undead spells(not even counting slay AA ability) stun spells, which gain/maintain agro far better than a taunt button(a button which they have btw), self 25% haste, inviso vs undead....and i am sure i have left something out, never played a pally this is just what i have seen and can do all this w/o 1 single AA point.<br />
<br />
so who is it exactly who has no clue about ballance??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>BrikBludgaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Valeris,<br />
<br />
Knights cast spells before the mob gets to camp...  how do you propose to get aggro without doing anything?  Warriors should NOT be casting....  I fully support changes to non-melee, non-magic damage sources (archery, throwing, etc) as long as it costs something to maintain.  I also support increasing the range on taunt to something a tad more reasonable...  yes, even warrior only if need be...  but in the end... you will still NEVER taunt like a hybrid at range.  Spells must always deal +hate, or casters have a field day... (and rogues/monks become worthless)<br />
<br />
TAUNT skill grabs aggro like a charm...  the problem is, warriors GET the successful taunt, and then LOSE it immediately. (or fail the taunt and have no other method to add +hate other than procs)<br />
<br />
I can hold aggro vs 200+ AAXP rogue/ranger/wizards with only my taunt button and a war-useable 2H...  its not as good as with my spells... but it works...  and this is with a lower Taunt skillcap.<br />
So I think the DEGREE of this is MUCH lesser than most warriors would have you believe.<br />
<br />
Snap aggro warriors have....  its the +hate after the taunt that you dont.<br />
<br />
Savvy Shadowknights drop +hate spells and effects AFTER a taunt....  so we have that much more of a hate lead over our taunt... this is our primary advantage.<br />
<br />
note, my plan gives you a +hate that cannot fail, doesn't fizzle, and doesnt cost you a dang thing. (and works without EB weapons, and is HELPED by EB weapons)<br />
<br />
I am telling you... this will help much more than nearly everything I have read... (except perhaps the ones that are so out of this world unbalanced that gthey might as well have been never mentioned) What i suggest is both doable AND quite effective.<br />
<br />
(provided we can get the elder warriors to recite the +hate mantra: DO NOT MASH TAUNT!)<br />
<br />

Im sorry, Knights have 700Hp less than a equivalent warrior in equivalent high-end gear... (elem armor and the SAME items in every other slot) this is NOT counting elem BP.<br />
<br />
Warriors have 120-150more AC than a knight using the same equipment as above.  (the knight could ready a shield, but then falls even furthur behind in the damage game)<br />
<br />
Knights deal 80% of the damage of warriors in melee... (parses against PoEB, BoT, PoV, PoTactics, and PoF....) this is wielding the SAME weapons.<br />
<br />
Knights have pointless disciplines...  that refresh 1/62 minutes at best and last for miniscule amounts of time in usefulness.<br />
<br />
<br />
like most warriors, you are willing to post whatever makes your case instead of looking at facts and fair comparisons...  mingle that with pure misinformation about knights and you have the pointless cases that we BOTH know will be ignored.<br />
<br />
<br />
Landrain...  I have elemental armor and weapons... I have items that will never again drop in the game ever again... I have experience since beta in this game and with my chosen class...

mahalito... you are the one who doesn't understand what you are saying...  I play a 65 knight as my main... my warrior is 59.. what level is your knight?  I've played since beta... and thus have many characters and thus classes under my belt.   I have seen every nerf, nearly every twist, and every zone in the game.   Sorry, but you haven't the slightlest clue about what you speak of...  knights pay DEARLY for their spells...  I doubt you will ever understand through you envy to see your ignorance.  The grass isn't greener.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just for the sake of argument...  when you suggest something... how do you think it will affect knights?  if you have 10000 Hp and a knight only has 7500, AND both knights and warriors cant taunt worth a darn, do you REALLY think knights will be anything more than &quot;lag causers&quot;?  oh come on... NOBODY here is that stupid.<br />

Knights cast spells before the mob gets to camp... how do you propose to get aggro without doing anything? Warriors should NOT be casting.... I fully support changes to non-melee, non-magic damage sources (archery, throwing, etc) as long as it costs something to maintain. I also support increasing the range on taunt to something a tad more reasonable... yes, even warrior only if need be... but in the end... you will still NEVER taunt like a hybrid at range. Spells must always deal +hate, or casters have a field day... (and rogues/monks become worthless)<br />
 <br />
Thing is should knights or indeed any tank have the ability to gain aggro of that nature at a distance - the less risky it is to slow a mob before it enters the camp then the more the encounter is trivialised. <br />
<br />
With regard to the sentance i put in bold the reason for aggro on these spells is that it SHOULD NOT be in the spellcasters interest to gain the mobs attention, thats just what a Tank is looking for! <br />
<br />
Anyway, If it's decided that something should be done about knight spell aggro why can the knight spell lists not be adjusted in isolation?<br />
 <br />
TAUNT skill grabs aggro like a charm... the problem is, warriors GET the successful taunt, and then LOSE it immediately. (or fail the taunt and have no other method to add +hate other than procs) <br />
<br />
Firstly taunt does you very little good unless someone else has built sizeable aggro on a mob before it reaches the camp, generally speaking you have to wait for the mob to start whaling on someone before it's worth taunting, then when taunt fails you're looking pretty sick.<br />
<br />
Secondly, Spell's are a readily quantifiable source of aggro - you have control over your aggro output, me i just have to trust to the RNG.  Gaining control with spells is a much safer bet and the group knows it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now her's where i think you're overstating your own case.<br />
<br />
Yes, paladins and shadowknights have an array of abilties from spells...<br />
<br />
but we pay for them with 10% less hp, <br />
<br />
so in actual fact a 10k warrior has only 1k more hp's than a knight? how much additional durability (time between heals) does that offer a warrior then given pop mobs damage output? is that difference even significant at all on a less uber 5-6k buffed warrior?<br />
<br />
 pointless disciplines,<br />
<br />
Lemme see, mightystrike, fellstrike, charge, fearless, /shield is really only eyecandy in most cases, then you've got the various other long refresh discs that you don't dare touch in case you need to make a last ditch attempt at a /defensive/evasive or /fortitude cause the cleric was a few seconds slow on the heal....oh and hey whats that disc that gives you 10 15 secs of healing equal to damage you inflict? fills that particular situation quite nicely...As a warrior you have no real ability to save yourself nor any way to insulate yourself against a desperate situation, press that disc button and pray cause thats all you've got. <br />
<br />
So, these discs, that you don't use unless in an emergency most times, were supposed to offset spellcasting weren't they?<br />
Fnar.<br />
<br />
 lower and missing skillcaps, 20% less melee damage than a warrior <br />
<br />
Your lower defense causes you to be hit twice more (look i rounded up!) in every 100 swings or so doesn't it? something like that anyway :) as to the melee damage, well if you aren't tanking I imagine you could chuck out a pet and go offensive on your casts to help even up that DPS difference and if you are tanking then who the heck cares if your DPS is a fraction lower than an relatively low DPS warrior? Given the low share of the damage dealt a tank does compared with nukers etc that 20% difference is gonna make a very minor change in take down time..., <br />
<br />
and all the penalties of casting heaped on top of it <br />
<br />
I'd like to know what other casting penalties do you suffer besides the lower overall DPS already mentioned above?<br />
<br />
and keep in mind, a knight MUST cast or they are little more than an uber-nerfed warrior<br />
<br />
But up above you were telling me you did ok just with taunt and a warrior useable weapon? surely that means those spells are just cream on top?!? If you're not tanking then those spells just got a lot easier to let fly anyway didn't they? Wether they're massively useful or not the group can SEE you adding to the effort, whats a warrior do to aid his party's performance other than try desperately to keep the mob on him? provide a witty commentary?<br />
<br />
I don't claim to be an expert on hybrids so any further explainations you could offer would be useful, but I don't see the massive disadvantages you claim offset your advantages through spellcasting, not to mention the couple of other bits 'n pieces that knights have for 'colour'...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Roman_RoV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">As much as I enjoy the banter between Knights and Warriors, this is getting off topic.  I am a first time poster here, I play a Warrior as my main since back in March of 1999.  Also played a Bard, Shaman, Druid, Wizard, SK, and Rogue as well to 65 so you could say that I am familiar with other classes :P  <br />
<br />
With my Warrior as my main, I have invested a shit load of time in him, currently have 240 AA (only mention this due to the fact that any and all dmg increasing AA skills are maxxed) and lacking only in the innate resists and stats, with planar gear and EB procing weps.  Do I have problems with maintaining agro?  On a lucky stretch of procs, no.  Without luck?  You bet your ass.<br />
<br />
Like Brik (and I am sure many others here), I have played since way back when the dinosaurs roamed the planet and we had to walk to school uphill both ways....  I have seen classes  (the knights and rogues to name a few) go from gimps to viable classes.  I am happy for that.  Why?  Because every class should be viable.  Should Knights be able to tank?  Hell ya.  Look at the gear they have.  Look at the AA and spells they have.  It would be silly to think they shouldn't.<br />
<br />
The Knights/ Warriors/ Clerics/ Bards all wear Plate, why wouldnt they all have similar stats? For all I care we could all have the same hps straight across the board.  I liken it to RL, if two people did the same sort of fitness routine daily and took equally good care of themselves, would they not be VERY similar in Physical condition?  However if person A chose to specialize in running and person B chose Boxing, obviously there would be differences in what they could do but none the less the same basic physical platform, just different specializations.  Which is where the Knight/ Warrior debate would come in.  However, as stated above I think it is bad ass that they have been brought up to speed over time (who's kidding who they fucked bad up until SoV and even so then but came into their own in SoL).<br />
<br />
With all that being said, I don't want to be a Knight.  I don't want the spells, I dont want the skills they have.  Why?  I chose a Warrior for one reason and one reason only: pure melee.  The idea of and I quote directly from Sony's sight: <br />
<br />
Warriors are the masters of armed combat in all its many forms. They are right at home on the battlefield and are trained to take as much punishment as they dole out, because of their innately strong constitutions Sony's class listing and description (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/library/classes.jsp) . <br />
<br />
which has not been the case since EQ's release.<br />
<br />
Do I want to be god like with a bazillion more hps and AC more then other classes?  Nope, actually I think we do pretty well for ourselves.  Do I wish a nerf on the other classes?  Nope, as I stated previously, I am glad they finally got what they should have been since release (props to all the people that have stuck out those classes through all this time).<br />
<br />
However agro/ taunt issues still are there (applicable to warriors mainly).  The taunt value for Warriors needs to be upped, not a discipline or skill that needs to implemented, something as simple as a coding change that would allow the warrior class to realistically compete for agro, not rely on the sheer blind luck of a proc.  Inherently, Knights do get spells with levels that aid them in agro, why would it be so much to assess a value that is higher for the &quot;Masters of Combat&quot; and their taunt as they level?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well you are correct i dont know alot about hybrids, i do know about warriors and tankin<br />
<br />
10% less hp dont make much difference in the high end game(i got 9k  you got 8100 for ex) not gonna make much difference...rarely get a ch to land for more than 5k in group or raid anyway. Not saying that it aint nice to have that extra buffer, but for all the other crap you can do it's a pretty good trade off.<br />
<br />
20% less dammage..big deal, tank aint damage dealer, is damage taker ..a tank should know that, also phrase's dont account damage given via spells(stunns, that undead proc spell ect)<br />
<br />
lower skill caps well defense is same as warrior ,only the offenseive ones are slightly lower, explains the 20% less damage, and again for the purpose of tanking, the defense is the important one, but again a tank knows that.<br />
<br />
as for pointless disc with stupid duratins and reuse times, i sugest ya check out the warrior disc's before you whine much about hybird  ones but from the sounds of it seems all plate class disc's could use a little work.<br />
<br />
penalties of casting?? find this intresting way of looking at it, other than you have to buy spells and put the little gems up, i am at a loss here. and as far as mana goes hybrid spells use less mana than straight caster classes, i realize you have a lesser mana pool but since most hybrids now adays cant seem to play the game w/o kei anyway this really makes the mana argument kinda meaningless.  And again since all lucin and greater drops for plate class/tanks with very, very rare exception also inclue int/wis and mana you get another advantage there.<br />
<br />
Warriors dont want your &quot;array of abilites from spells&quot; we just want to do the one and only thing we do better than classes that can tank and do a dozen other things. Ballance means if you gonna do more than one thing, you dont do any of the things as well as the specilist.  <br />
<br />
also mr hybrid had this to say<br />
<br />

The grass isn't greener.<br />
<br />
Since i am so ignorant, i will require an explanation on how DEARLY these spells cost, cause from my standpoint, you are getting the best of both worlds, nearly the full abilities of a warrior and countless other abilites.  Explain to this stupid warrior where the &quot;balance is&quot;. And in case your &quot;cost&quot; agrument is you have to get parchments and runes, spare me, at least your class got something out of pop.  IF  /fizzle /interrupted /stunned is your idea of DEARLY costing then your toon has a problem, cause i have grouped with countless hybrids and have never seen this to cause them any problems in maintaing/acheiving agro in any case.<br />
<br />
<br />
I realize that early in EQ the hybrid was underpowered, but that is simply not the case today, and hybrids need to get over that, times have changed.  You use a 3+ yr old argument that has no realistic meaning in EQ as it stands today.  Things are reversed now, if not worse.  I can see why hybrids are so parinoid everytime someone brings this topic up, i wouldnt want it to go back to where it was back then either if i was a hybrid, but there has to be a middle ground here somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>FennyMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">how about putting /disc charge onto the shield disc timer.   noone ever uses the disc anyway so its pretty useless as is.  putting it as 3 mintues would give it a lot of flexibility for use as fast agro or plain old dps.<br />
<br />
not sure how ppl would exploit it though, maybe weighted axe type weaps would make it too powerful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Ok I'm coming in as an outsider on this thread being that my main is a 63 shaman (I do have a 50 warrior so I have seen the other side of the team), however I am married to a thick headed warrior.  Warrior taunt does need some tweaking desperately.  My husband and I are by no means on the high end in terms of equipment.  But from a warrior standpoint, warriors shouldn't have to be in order to do their job effectively.  I'm not bashing hybrids at all here but it does seem a bit ridiculous to have a level 55 paladin/sk be able to take agro away from a level 65 warrior with just the cast of a single spell!  Granted, hybrids should do their part in managing their own agro while working as part of a team.  But we shouldn't have to tell them that they can't cast spells that are part of their class just so the warrior can do their job.  <br />
<br />
We regularly group with a paladin and he is a godsend with the various abilities that he can use in any given situation.  We get an accidental (or accidently on purpose) double pull, he's an awesome offtank.  He has saved our arses many times with group heals.  But he also pays dearly for using that group heal by catching agro off the mob that the warrior is tanking if he hits it too early in the fight.  Should a 600 point heal pull that much agro that it taunts a mob off of a taunting warrior?  NO!<br />
<br />
In my eyes, there are 2 class defining traits for a warrior: damage mitigation and taunt.  They have the damage mitigation down pat but taunt definitely needs some major work.  My suggestion would be an AA ability that is trainable at various levels from level 51 on up.  This ability would increase agro more for each level trained.  I know that this sounds tedious for those like my husband who have the &quot;no sleep or AA til 65&quot; theory, but this may be a way to make things a little more &quot;balanced.&quot;  Also this way would make sure that /disc was freed up for when defensive was needed.  There have been many times when defensive has saved my husband's arse even in an xp group.  To have to use /disc for a taunt increaser (even one with a 3 minute reset timer) would mean that there might be a  time when it was needed that it wouldn't be available.<br />
<br />
By the way, I wouldn't trade my warrior partner (in RL or in EQ) for the world.  A warrior/shaman team can totally rock in any situation where the mob is slowable.  Once that mob is slowed, it's just a matter of time. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Good post, but that should be an innate ability, as apposed to AA's.<br />
<br />
For the simple reason, warriors should not have to depend on gaining experience OVER AND ABOVE levels (IE AA'S) to be able  to do a job that they should be able to do innately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Exactly. No more AA, no more broken /disc, no more itemisation.  Fix the INNATE abilities of the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>corillis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I think warriors should get an ability (innate, not 'clicked') that randoms a chance of tackling the mob when it runs off towards someone else, if the mob has been taunted succesfully / not succesful by the warrior.<br />
<br />
Also, a check should be made if the warrior gets an attack of oppertunity.<br />
This idea comes from D&amp;D, on which most of EQ is based anyway. <br />
If the mob focusses on a different person, and moves, the warrior/tank gets an attack of oppertunity. (A free strike) Make this strike like a crippling blow, maybe less damage, but at least a decent +aggro. More like &quot;Hey mister, don't ya be thinkin' 'bout doin' that!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tackle should be like an attack of oppertunity, but briefly stuns the mob. And, when the mob is on the floor after a succesful tackle, the warrior should get a chance to keep the mob down. (By either bashing, slamming, cripple, crit and whatnot. But only if the warrior hits the mob)<br />
<br />
Also, warrior should get the aa (class) to perform a 'knockdown' (like in D&amp;D)<br />
This requires the use of a 2Handed weapon, or, maybe a succesfull bash/kick/slam.<br />
When knocked down, the mob should suffer an AC penalty to all melee attacks (for each and every melee class - and by this also boosting the want for groups to get more melee in the group)<br />
<br />
So basically:<br />
<br />
-Warrior taunts, but mob still runs off something like 3-4 sec later: warrior gets a chance to tackle.<br />
<br />
-Moving mobs suffer a attacks of oppertunity. This counts for all melee classes, or maybe only War/Pal/SK.<br />
<br />
-Warriors, elite fighters that have chosen not to spread their specialisation out over magics and the art of fighting, should get more little tricks. PoP brought many kinds of tricks, like rampage and double riposte, but warriors should also get knockdown. The fell an opponent with a mighty, well aimed blow and dazzle the opponent a brief while, causing the opponent to be less agile, and suffer an avoidance penalty / mitigation penalty.<br />
This period can be prolonged by succesful bashes, kicks and slams. - warrior only-(Duh, mob on the ground, how is he going to dodge a kick, this isn't the matrix or max payne)<br />
<br />
This doesn't 'nerf' palladins, they can have their stuns. They gave up a lot for it.<br />
This doesn't give warriors 100% secure control of aggro, but it improves the chance to regain aggro, if they lose it. <br />
It's contructive for the warrior class, since it doens't blur classes, it gives warriors a specific advantage. It's not quite as good as some stuns, or snares, but it's a warrior-style approach.<br />
Now, imagine a warrior AND a palladin in the group. Say the palladin tanks, since he has better gear, or the chanter still prefers a pally because of the aggro-security. The warrior can still smash the mob down, and make it more vulnerable for a brief period, improving the effectiveness of monks, pallies, SK's, warriors, rangers and rogues. (like cripple, but not magic)<br />
<br />
Attacks of oppertunity are actually quite realistic: the mob runs past you, not really paying attention to you. Why not stab em in the back, or put your foot out eh?<br />
<br />
I don't believe it will overpower melee, because it's actually a bit underpowered compared to nukers. (Nor do the effects last very long, maybe long enough for ANY melee to catch aggro and not our cloth wearing brothers and sisters)<br />
AND it doesn't blur classes and steal from other classes, it DOES however make certain combinations of classes more wanted (war + melee, both pal and war in a group....)<br />
<br />
I thought long and hard on a way in which you don't nerf other classes, don't really make warriors stronger, but fix aggro and group desirability.<br />
All I had to do was read the D&amp;D manual.<br />
<br />
I urge all warriors, don't flame, don't swear... THINK.<br />
No, we don't have the numbers, like druids do, to demand stuff, we can, however, think, refine, discuss and provide SOE with some small points for them to work out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">&quot;Fix the INNATE abilities of the class.&quot;<br />
<br />
SOE has talked a lot about rebalancing the melee classes.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, most of what I've heard from their posts here and there haven't mentioned fixing the innate abilities of the class.<br />
<br />
A lot of players want the innate abilities to be the fix. That way it helps everyone across the board.<br />
<br />
I think the most basic premise here is ... at level 35 melees stop getting skills. They all get one at 60, Triple Attack or Assassinate. But that's a lot of levels that the other classes get spells where melees get nothing but the endless search for gear.<br />
<br />
Then there's 61 to 65, where melees got just items. No upgrades to disciplines (some which are pointless anyways, like ask a monk how often they've used ashen hand in their career, heh) ... no upgrades to any innate skill caps ... no new discs or new skills.<br />
<br />
I have a feeling the melee upgrades will come right before or right after Lost Dungeons goes live. Much like many of the caster rebalancing happened right before PoP.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also, is it just me ... or is anyone else sort of annoyed by the fact that INT and WIS cap higher than any other stat in the game? The SKILL CAP thing really bugs me because of this. Skill caps are hard coded at 252? BS! They said items were hard capped at 100 hit points for like ever, and that proved untrue. They said stats were hard capped at 250 and that proved untrue. Now they even have an IMBALANCE in what stats you can raise, as casters can go higher than melees. I know, it's small thing. It's just annoying when I stop to think about it. Casters can get what, 355 int? And melees can't even get past 252 in their offense and defense skills. /boggle</div></div><hr />

How about..a clickable ability (a LoH type clickable ability, innate one) that gives us a 6 second window..where every hit we land (as in damage) we proc. With a reuse of say... 4 minutes. That would give us quite an edge. <br />
<br />
Or like some other people have said with monks, they used to be able to tank just as well...just like Knights can now..and SoE nerfed the crap out of them.
