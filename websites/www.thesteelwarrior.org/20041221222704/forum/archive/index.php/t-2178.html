<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ishiro</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SoE wants more people to use shields.  Warriors want to be able to hold taunt better.<br />
<br />
So here is the idea I had (if its a repeat, I apologize)...<br />
<br />
Add a new weapon skill for warriors (when introduced put the skill at the level cap for the warrior so they don't have to spend 3 weeks skilling it up) called &quot;Shield&quot;.  This skill would be similar to other weapon skills: slashing, piercing, blunt.  Give all warrior equipable shields a delay, base damage off of AC the way the Bash skill currently does.  Unlike the Bash skill however, the innate ability of &quot;Shield&quot; or &quot;Offhand Bashing&quot; would not be a chance to stun but an aggro increaser, guaranteed every swing and based off the delay (similar to the 2handed damage bonus).<br />
<br />
In this format, you would allow the non-tanking warrior on a raid to use a 2hander or 2 1handers for damage, but the main tank would equip a shield for the added taunt value.<br />
<br />
This could also be designed to give the warrior a bonus to block based on his skill in shield while having a shield equipped.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that's it... thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Furious Bash is kind of like that and the bag of chips. ^_^ It works rather nicely if the bash lands.<br />
<br />
In a more general thing, the shield thing in general is going to be extremely tricky for Warriors.<br />
<br />
For every expandsion to date, all 1H weapons are geared to be Dual Wielded which is generally weak when used with a shield.  A Warrior switching to 1H + Shield is far more of a hit than a Knight doing the same because all of our 1H weapons were geared to be used with a shield.  To make shields viable for Warriors is going to take more than just making shields do something new.<br />
<br />
I really like the idea that shields block all Repostes.  A general block modifier is too tricky.  How do you value one shield's blocking over another.  However if all shields just blocked all Repostes then you not only have a clearly measuable level of mitigation beyond 2H or DW you don't have to worry about gimping or retuning monsters.<br />
<br />
Of course this depends on solving the original problem with 1H + Shield for Warriors. *sigh*<br />
<br />
edit: bah typo.  not sure why I wrote &quot;stun&quot; instead of &quot;bash</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ishiro</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But your assuming with 1H + Shield you are losing a hand.  My proposal is basically to make the shield a weapon.  If its got a 20 delay on the shield, it &quot;swings&quot; based on a dual wield check every 2 seconds, with a double attack check too.  And it does damage similar to the current Bash style where the damage is based on the AC of the shield (the &quot;heavier&quot; the shield, the more damage it should do when you hit someone with it).<br />
<br />
Essentially, my suggestion is to actually make the shield a weapon for the warrior, where it has an innate aggro increaser built into the swing.  Damage and agro.<br />
<br />
Knights of course would hate this, because I'm sure someone will say that 4 years ago Verant told them they were &quot;masters of the shield&quot; or something equally silly, and that they should get this.  To which I would respond, &quot;You can have it when you give up your spells.&quot;  :)<br />
<br />
As for blocking.. *shrug* being able to deflect all ripostes would of course be good, however, if the shield does damage and increases aggro, then asking for something of that calibre might be asking for the moon, and they'll wave off the whole idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
of course I can already here the cries of dissent.. LOL<br />
<br />
There is Role Playing Precendent for this, Slam is just no longer a viable advantage to large races especially when we get shrunk all the time.<br />
<br />
I am so sick of being shrunk..<br />
<br />
IMO, the SLAM/UNSTUNN OGRE effect should go away if the classes are shrunk, but then I am a rpg flunky at heart...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aeka is a pally btw, and I got the impression that Aeka thought there was some definate merit to your idea, and just pointed out some potential problems that might be inherent.  If you can make it so that, with a shield equiped, I can still hold agro without totally gimping the DPS members of the group, I would be all for it.  As Aeka pointed out, with the warrior usable 1 hand weapons out there, this would be very difficult.  The other difficulty will be that, if you can hold agro with the shield, plus get the AC and other bonuses with them, you will effectivly kill dual weild, because who in their right mind would put a weapon in offhand when you can put a shield there and gain all that.<br />
<br />
Overall, not a bad idea, but SoE would have to be very carefull in tuming it.</div></div><hr />

Lower ac and stats than most shields, but still allowing bash while weilding a 2hander.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apothes Drudoll</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The warrior problem is easily solved change all knight weapons to warrior usable but only when equipped with a shield. IE I saw some stuff the other day in the bazzar that said required dodge skill of 30. so for the knight weapons put on there war usable req being shield equipped or stats = 0. May be a little trickier then that to code since I don't know the code base but with the req stuff they are doing now I sincerely doubt it would be that hard.<br />

The below is to a few select people. (they know who they are)<br />

If you wish to bitch about my spelling or grammer or make personal attacks on me please pm me with your flame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just turning shields into an off hand weapon isn't a good idea because the middle ground is way to small.  If you make it too good you've just killed DW.  If it is still makes for poor performance then no one will use it.<br />
<br />
For Knights the division is simple: 2H = Offense, 1H + Shield = Defense (or at least that is how it is supposed to be...right now 1H + Shield = throwing away DPS for the stats on the shield).  The issue is muddled for Warriors because of the three way split.<br />
<br />
The best combination of ideas seems to be making shields block Reposts and 1H DB bonus shifts higher when only one is used (why don't Warriors have a different DB calculation anyway?).  There is some merrit to the idea of 2H + Shield but that pretty much leaves one combination left to rot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aeka summed it up very well.  Can't think of a better way to explain it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Selaradrid</div><div class="date">07-26-2003, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The way I see it, there is a couple major flaws with this idea, even though initially it sounds good.<br />
<br />
but, for starters, as already stated. warrior 1hs weapons are low dmg weapons compared to knight 1hs weapons. reason being. DW. DW 2 knight equivalent 1hs was considered to be TOO POWERFUL and thats why they are not warrior usable.  this more than anything is why warriors dont use shields. our DPS drops way too much.<br />
<br />
next, they can make some warrior only 1hs with high dmg that are equal to knight 1hs.  but if they did that, most warriros would instantly get 2 of them for duel wielding. and if they were primary only, then 1 of them for main hand for big dmg and 1 normal proccing weapon for offhand. either way, it will again be considered overpowering.<br />
<br />
as for changing knight 1hs to warrior usable. well, then we are in the same boat as we are now. the prices on these weapons would jump astronomically because warriors would want them.  you think a BOC is expensive. wait till some of them weapons become warrior usable. <br />
<br />
makeing new 1hs weaps that are equable with a shield only wont solve the problem either. those weapons would be rare and extremly expensive.  not to mention that that in turn would make the shield expensive as well.  lets face it folks. when it coems to the market, people want shitloads of money for anything...if they saw that a warrior needs this extremely expensive 1hs weapon so they can use a shield..well, if they pay that for a sword.. what will they pay for a shield?   it will be liek the bloodmetal earing on my server...they sell for 45k each...1 of the componets for that earing is a highly polished gem..which sells for 38k each. why? because they go hand in hand. cant make a earing without the gem...same will go for a sword that warriors need to be able to effectivly use a shield...<br />
<br />
a shield itself like you were talking, able to be equiped as a weapon for aggro purposes would be extremely rare and extremely expensive.  a plus hate shield that works as a weapon for dmg? while at the same adding the bonus of AC, stats and effects?  Never going to happen, and even if it did, it would cost millions of plat to buy 1.  you would need to ebay every copper that is for sale on the internet to be allowed graciously to even look at 1, let alone buy it.  only uber guilds would be able to get it, and that does not solve the problem for the average warrior.<br />
<br />
Nyway, that was just my thoughys on the idea</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">07-26-2003, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A wizard can crit all day long for 5k, yet a warrior with a 24/20 weapon is over powering?<br />

<br />
etc.<br />

Very Very little could make warriors overpowering.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">07-26-2003, 07:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They need to up monk and rogue dps anyhow...<br />
<br />
might as well up warrior dps...<br />
<br />
perhaps warrior dps will reach grounds where it will be enough to hold semi-decent aggro. And procs will become just a bonus, rather then an absolute necessity.<br />
<br />
the way I see how DPS should be,  is this proportion: (based on knight dps)<br />
knight = 1(spells counted), warrior = 2, monk = 3.5, rogue = 4.<br />
<br />
As for shields...<br />
The problem is most ideas would kill dual wield...<br />
if it doesnt kill dual wield, then it's probably not interesting enough to be used.<br />
<br />
The best ideas I've seen to make shields viable for warriors, is the ones that give the warrior a good advantage in tanking,<br />
and not on aggro.<br />
Making shields aggro givers is what would kill DW, because then DW's use would be only dps... and 2hs beats that.<br />
<br />
We could also put in a Warrior only skill, called &quot;shield&quot; (sorry, using same name you gave Ishiro ;) )<br />
Which would just be another chance to block incoming hits when you have a shield....<br />
so when you're shielded... you can block, dodge, riposte, parry AND shield.<br />
<br />
It's a boring upgrade imo :p... and it's FAR from being any fix..<br />
but it would be a nice and very deserved upgrade imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikos</div><div class="date">07-27-2003, 04:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To increase utility, when a shield is equiped :<br />
<br />
1) Add a larger dmg bonus on Primary to make up for lack of weapon in Secondary. <br />
<br />
2) Increase proc rate of weapons in Primary to make up for lack of procing weapon in Secondary.<br />
<br />
<br />
No need to create new weapons with Knight-like ratios, nor making knight 1hs weapons warrior equipable. The above would make using shields much more attractive, alongside block with shield and Furious Bash.<br />
<br />
Warriors would be able to use whatever weapon they have with shields right away.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ishiro</div><div class="date">07-27-2003, 07:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't really believe my idea would kill dual wield...  if the shield as a weapon (meaning in the hands of a warrior the shield has a dmg/delay just like any other weapon) caused agro on every swing, then a warrior not main tanking wouldn't want to have a shield equipped, therefore either 2handing or 2 1handers.<br />
<br />
Essentially I was looking at this as a weapon alternative to being able to selectively allow the warrior to decide when they want to have more agro.  Because, at least with the warriors I have spoken to, they want to be able to be like paladins and shadow knights in the respect of being able to absolutely grab and hold agro when needed.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, yes I also think warriors need some better ratio weapons if nothing else is done to help them generate agro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ever hear of  camping shit? I mean what do all warriors buy thier weapons? I mean come on if the change went live sure a lot would try to buy them but there is the easy way of camping the god damn things. I think you all have more to worry about then what people will charge for something. But hey it is going to make the weapons spendy so we better not advocate the change cause only thies with money can get one right away the rest of us are too damn lazy to camp our own and if we can't afford one and too lazy to camp our own no one should get them.<br />
<br />
to sum it up. .... PFFT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikos</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Valeris, yes thats pretty much it. <br />
<br />
If they put some effort in it, SoE could make any shield work kinda like the charms we got when the planes were opened.<br />
<br />
For example, when X shield falls in the hand of a warrior, it is modified so that it grants the warrior: Increased Damage Bonus in Primary, Increased proc rate in primary, Increased ATK bonus.<br />
<br />
Every class that can use a shield does get the Block ability that was originally sugested.  But none of the modifiers Warriors get when equiping it, since warriors are a Dual-wielding class and have no 1hs/1hb/1hp designed for shields. <br />
<br />
Something along those lines. <br />
<br />
No need to farm some rare shield of a highly contested named that grants the modifiers. Even a Sarnak Battleshield should work. Of course if you wanted a shield with better stats and Furious Bash, you do have to hunt/raid for it.<br />
<br />
Equiping 2hander with shield sounds cool. But the DPS while using a shield should not equal using a 2hander. But thats just my opinion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BrikBludgaard</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 08:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shields should be about protection...<br />
<br />
1) All shields have a default BLOCK percentage similar to Damage bonus... all classes that can use shields benefit from this...  warriors should see a flat bonus whenever ANY shield is wielded.<br />
<br />
2) WAR/PAL/SK when using a shield, can use /steelwall.  This blocks a higher percentage of incoming blows + the shields block mod for 30 seconds...  reuseable every 10 minutes.  This ability STACKS with /defensive...  it is NOT a discipline, but a function of skill with a shield.<br />
<br />
3) Warriors should be able to get shields that add to Damage bonus in primary hand.  Heck... some of it might even be innate!<br />
<br />
<br />
Shields can and SHOULD be useful.<br />
