<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sisthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I notice yesterday that my 13 ranger on Friona Vi was hitting for 20's with a SOtBS in main and today he is hitting for 6. I guess it finaly got fixed. If this is not a bug from the patch then i believe all this recomended level stuf for meele will shoot down fast in price as NO one will want a weapon that is recomended 56 for a level 20 character that can not hit for more than 10 with it. I also can not confirm but I have not yet seen it proc today either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>dirge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Arg.  Well, we kind of knew this was coming, but I'll miss some of my weapons for a few weeks.<br />
<br />
I'm betting Blackened Acrylia Blades go way up in price, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tanerin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can confirm this.. my weapons have significantly decreased in damage.  I just bought the Blackend Acrylia Blade for my 30 warrior.. could anyone else think of a good weapon for the off-hand?  I was thinking of just getting a crystallized short blade or something, becuase I saw nothing else that great in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">prices are about to plummet on our droga combo et al.<br />
<br />
btw the dmg fixes and the proc fixes .. these items arent gonna be worth shit-all unless youre the proper level. buh-bye twinks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gaylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Finally they fixed this :)<br />
<br />
Maybe now those of use w/o access to better weapons can have a chance to get one w/o having to deal with the Elemental level people camping it 24/7 to twink thier alts.</div></div><hr />
