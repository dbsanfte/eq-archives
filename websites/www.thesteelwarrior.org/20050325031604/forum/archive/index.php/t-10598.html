IGNPC: WoW offers much faster character progression than other MMOs out there, with many players reaching the level cap in just a couple weeks. Since this design seems to favor PvP end-game, do you have plans to add content specific to the PvE servers to keep things interesting for those high-level players? <br />
<br />
Jeffrey Kaplan: The introduction of PvP Battlegrounds along with continual live content update patches should please maximum-level players. And we have some really cool stuff planned, too. Currently, we have two outdoor raid monsters in the queue, along with a maximum-level group dungeon and a raid dungeon. Plus, the PvP honor system will really open things up on both PvP and normal (PvE) servers.<br />

this info is straight out of the march issue of ComputerGames Magazine. i wont give away too much of what it says so youll have to pick it up for yorselves :) but i thought it would be ok to show you guys the preview of the future instances. <br />

the magazine also talks about the honor system, battlegrounds, and world events <br />
.. <br />
what caught my eye out of the whole article...Blizzard tossing around the idea of implementing arial combat... <br />

FUTURE INSTANCES <br />
<br />
Dire Maul <br />
<br />
This great city, now in ruins, once comprised the greatest nightelf city in all of kalimdor. Known as Eldre'thalas, it was the crown jewel of highborn society and arcane research and study. Yet, as kalimdor was Shattered by the great sundering, the city was broken and the sorceress highborn were cursed to wander the wreckage forever. The City Lay abandoned for centuries until the mighty ogre, King Gordok, took posession of the ruins. now the ogres hold the city in an iron grip, covetous of the arcane secrets still held by the stirring highborn ghosts. it is also rumored that a band of satyrs has slipped into the shadowed ruins - also bent on plumbing the cities secrets for their own dark machinations <br />
<br />
Other info: Dire maul is a 47-56 instance in feralas, it also mentions that it will be &quot;winged&quot; like the scarlet monestary <br />
<br />
<br />
Blackwing Lair <br />
<br />
At the fiery pinnacle of blackrock spire lies the menacing Blackwing lair. Originally built as part of the Dark iron Fortress, the lair has recently been transformed into the abode of the sinister black dragon, Nefarian. Guarded by the fanatical dragonspawn and various agents of the black flight, blackwing lair is one of the most hazardous locations in azeroth. Nefarian is ruthless in protecting his dark sanctum and the vile expirements he lords over. Only those brave enough to enter his lair will discover the terrifying secrets of the black dragonflight, and uncover their true plan to re-conquer the mortal world! <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Zul'Gurub <br />
<br />
Zul'gurub is the capital of the fallen Gurubashi empire that once dominated the lands of Stranglethorn, and its various islands off of the south seas. Zul'Gurub is still guarded by the canibalistic Jungle trolls and thier holy order of Hakkari priests. some believe that the Nefarious Priests seek to bring thier ancient blood-god, Hakkar the soulflayer, back to life. Puportedly, the secrets to hakkars rebirth are kept safe within the crumbling troll city. However, none who have ventured into the savage land have ever returned to confirm these dark rumors. <br />
<br />
Other info: Zul'gurub is a 55-60 instance in northern stranglethorn, tuned for 5 player groups. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ahn'Qiraj <br />
<br />
Little is known of the ancient kingdom of Ahn'qiraj, save for sacttered legends concerning its creators-the enigmatic sorcerers known as the Qiraji. Night Elf tales abound of the Qiraji's strange hold over the insect like sillithid - and thier symbiotic link with the terrifying race. It's Become clear that the Qiraji are stirring once again behind the sand blasted walls of thier kingdom. the Sillithid have begun to amass in the southern regions of kalimdor. None know what vast evil might spew forth if the gates of Ahn'Qiraj were ever breached. <br />
<br />
Other Info: The Gates of Ahn'Qiraj can only be opened by a mighty player driven quest. Once the gates are open, the spoils of Ahn'qiraj will be available for anyone on the server that can rise to the challenge. This will be a full blown raid zone, tuned for 40 max level player. it will have various types of encounters with some taking place in the open sands, and others deep within the hive tunnels <br />
<br />
<br />
Karazhan <br />
<br />
Nestled in the forbidding peaks of the Deadwind pass, the lonely tower of Karazhan stands as a haunting reminder of glories past. Once the home and sanctum of the guardian Medivh, Karazhan and its surrounding hamlet have fallen to complete ruin. Now the dead tower is home to the restless dead - and worse. Rumors abound that Medivh's private laboratories and libraries hold the key to mysterious portals to the Twisting Nether. Those who have returned from the dark tower told of demonic horrors that roamed the upper floors. Though none now know who truely controlls the tower, it is clear that some evil force has taken up residence in Medivh's stead. <br />
<br />
Other info: Karazhan is designed for a 5-man group of only the highest level players. it has a unique design made up of multiple sections, each of which will play as a separate dungeon, with at least 3 separate instance entrances. <br />
<br />
<br />
Alterac Valley <br />
<br />
The Frosty Peaks of Alterac Valley have been stained by the blood of warriors. The Windswept valley has been claimed by both the horde and the alliance. The Frostwolf orcs(warcheif thralls hereditary clan) have lived in the secluded valley for many decades, but their village has been threatened by the recent arrival of the dwarf expiditionary force led by General Vanndar Stormpike. The Dwarves, seeking the precious metal beneath the frosty earth, care little for the Orc's land claims. Now the forces of the horde and alliance spill onto the area daily - intent on retaking the valley for thier respective causes. However, unbeknownst to both factions, the Winteraxe Trolls have arisen to make thier own claim upon the frozen wasteland. Only time will tell which faction will have final domination. <br />
<br />
Other Info: Alterac Valley with be the first Battleground instance, the primary focus is PvP combat and it is intended for players that are level 50 and up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From all the texts in game, the first expansion will probably be Daeron (err, probably off on that name) the orc homeworld, and quite a ways off .</div></div><hr />

half the shit Isk says is either so clever it goes way above my head or is an inside joke and i'm not in the club.  :p   figured i'd share my cluelessness with the class, heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i'll believe it when they actually do something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
But in the expansion, I believe!<br />
<br />
Been quite a while =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">02-11-2005, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought it was WC that introduced the orc homeworld, as you had to destroy the portal from which they came at the end. Wow, thats been so long ago since I played that game. Anyways, the whole premise of orcs is that they are an alien race twisted and bent by some evil being (name?) and used to conquer azeroth. Appearantly, this evil dude (tm) gets off destroying worlds created by the good beings. who seek out new owrlds and populate them with sentient races and provide demi-god protectors like the one that watches over the night elf tree and created the druids.<br />
<br />
Anywho, after the orcs failed to conquer azeroth, the evil dude (again, i can't remember) created the scourge to try and destroy azeroth. Meanwhile the orcs, under Thrall's? leadership, rediscover their shamanistic culture and begin their current search for spiritual healing from the bloodlust that the evil dude gave them.<br />
<br />
That, I believe, is warcraft in a nutshell. there was also some stuff about how nightelves came about and where the highborn came from and went. Also, theres an explaination as to why there is corruption in the big tree home of the night elves and how it relates to not having the blessing of the protectors that the good guys gave to azeroth. Lots of good lore there to be found if you look for it. But don't take my word for it I could be wrong on some details and the full story is quite interesting for those patient enough to find it.</div></div><hr />
