The three brothers waited on their knees on the floor of the dojo, their father standing behind them. All watched the challenger who waited at the end of the long hall.
   <P align=justify>     "Tell me, my sons, what do you see?"
    <P align=justify>    Shintaro spoke first, as the eldest. "This man is a formidable warrior, very aware of his surroundings. He watches us and yet is still aware of the sound of the birds outside." 
    <P align=justify>    Jiro took his turn. "The sword slung over his shoulder is a tachi. The extra length of the tachi gives it a slower yet most powerful attack. We should have a speed advantage, but he will have better reach, and great strength."
  <P align=justify>      Azami weighed his brother's comments. Perhaps it was because he was still in the middle of his samurai training, but he felt he recognized something in the way this challenger carried himself. "This man has a stillness to him. I feel he may be a quick-draw master."
  <P align=justify>      Osenami Shinji touched his hand to his eldest son's shoulder, bidding him to follow. "Be mindful of your brothers' observations."
<P align=justify>        "I would face him, Father," Jiro said softly as Shintaro rose from the floor where they waited.
    <P align=justify>    Their father did not look back at his younger sons. "Watch more closely then, Jiro. You are no match for this samurai. Learn to see the opponent and yourself as clearly as Azami does. At least he knows when he is outmatched."
    <P align=justify>    Jiro bowed his head. Azami raised hid head and turned his gaze again upon the intruder with the tachi. He did know that he was no match for this man, and also that Jiro would never be. This challenger was a samurai of no small worth. Why had he come so far into the countryside to challenge the Dragonfly-beats-its-wings sword school? Perhaps this samurai was seeking training in the new two-swords style, but needed to test the mettle of this branch's techniques before submitting to training.
  <P align=justify>      Shinji and Shintaro were greeting the newcomer, whose name was Masatomo. Azami did not like what he saw. The challenger was coldly polite, and the bow he gave Osenami Shinji was not the sort of bow an equal gives another.
      <P align=justify>  Shinji seated himself as Shintaro and Masatomo took their positions in the middle of the training hall. Shintaro drew his blades, the long katana and shorter wakizashi. Masatomo drew his long tachi from its sheath over his shoulder.
    <P align=justify>    I was wrong about the quick-draw, Azami thought. What did I see in him? Why is his stillness so unsettling?
  <P align=justify>      His brother circled the challenger, trying to draw his older opponent into motion. Masatomo pivoted a slow step, remaining focused on Shintaro, but made no move to attack. Shintaro feinted an attack, but the challenger could see that Shintaro was too far away to hit , and he did not even try to block.
 <P align=justify>       By that feint, Shintaro had allowed Masatomo to gauge his range, a very dangerous error. Azami winced at his brother's mistake. This was by far the most dangerous challenger they had met at the dojo. Azami or Jiro had handled most of the travelers seeking to be students. A match to the drawing of blood would let their swordsmaster father judge the newcomer's fighting skill. This match seemed much more serious, and his brother's next error might be his last.
    <P align=justify>    The tip of the tachi dipped toward the floor as Masatomo pivoted, and Shintaro stepped closer, two blades moving swiftly to the attack. Masatomo slashed, Shintaro blocked with his wakizashi and swung with the katana. 
  <P align=justify>      Azami gasped as he saw the opening, but before he could fill his lungs his brother's swords clattered to the floor. The tachi had pierced Shintaro's shoulder, and his right arm hung useless. Masatomo sheathed his tachi blade and bowed a short bow of one who dismisses. Shintaro staggered up from his knees, blood dripping from between fingers clutching his wound, and returned a respectful and thankful bow.
   <P align=justify>     He let Shintaro live! Azami breathed a sigh of relief. Shintaro could still teach, perhaps, even if his arm would never regain the strength to fight again. At least it was something to hold on to.
   <P align=justify>     When he looked up, his sister was drawing his eldest brother away, and his father stood facing the challenger. Scattered crimson drops of blood decorated the wood floor polished by twenty years of students' footsteps.
     <P align=justify>   Osenami Shinji drew his blades and held his arms out to his sides, in a ready position. Masatomo was very still, refusing to be pulled out of his defensive position. He knew he had the advantage in reach, and was not going to make himself vulnerable to the greater speed of the swordsmaster with the two shorter swords.
   <P align=justify>     The two warriors circled one another. Masatomo again dipped the tip of his tachi toward the floor as he turned, but Shinji paid no heed to the false opening that had fooled his son. Masatomo made a quick thrust that proved too short to reach the swordsmaster, and Shinji batted it away with a deft backhand flip of the katana. Each had taken the measure of each other's range, and the battle began in earnest.
    <P align=justify>    Osenami Shinji was a master of the Two Skies school of swordsmanship, and the founder of his own Dragonfly-beats-its-wings branch of that school. His two swords cleaved the air in a flashing pattern of interlacing figure eights, like the beating of a dragonfly's wings. The katana flew in deadly arcs, and the patterns the shorter wakizashi traced, closer to the body,  were defensive.
  <P align=justify>      The two men moved cautiously, Masatomo maintaining his defenses and watching for an opening his reach would make available, Shinji slashing in and dodging out with bursts of speed. 
   <P align=justify>     Masatomo was a patient and dangerous warrior, his guard position constantly changing.  He let Shinji get nearly behind him as he pivoted slowly, and took up a very strange guard, with his body between
his own outstretched blade and the deadly pair his opponent held. 
       <P align=justify> Shinji advanced in a flurry of steel, and Masatomo's blade came around in a fast, powerful stroke that glanced off Shinji's wakazashi and drove the old man back. 
  <P align=justify>      Azami clenched his fists on his knees. He shook his head. Unseen sword style. So that's what I saw. He hides the position of his sword, and then angles the blade as he swings, so that only the edge faces the opponent. It's very hard to see the attack coming or gauge its speed when you can only see the thin edge of the blade. Is the dragonfly defense Father designed strong enough to repel this?
    <P align=justify>    Masatomo swung powerfully with the long sword, raising sparks from both of Shinji's blades as the swords crashed together. Shinji's counter-attack came up a fraction too short, only slicing the challenger's sleeve. Shinji stepped closer, the blades scraping and showering sparks onto the bloody floor. The decorated hand guards of the two long swords caught together, the wings of the dragonfly wedged between two twining dragons. Both men struggled to free their blades from each other. Shinji's short sword flashed in that moment towards the challenger's exposed belly, but Masatomo leaped forward and threw all the strength of both hands into forcing the locked swords down.
   <P align=justify>     Shinji had only one hand on his katana, and could not hold against the surge. The swords dropped and the tachi sunk deep into Shinji's thigh as the short wakizashi was pinned between the two men and drew no blood.
   <P align=justify>     Masatomo panted as he sheathed his sword and walked from the hall. "I close this school until a suitable challenger can be found," he growled softly.
     <P align=justify>   Jiro leaped to his feet, but their father raised his hand. "No, Jiro," he said quietly, "there has been enough defeat today for this family. You and your brother must travel the warrior's pilgrimage before you can regain the honor of our school." Shinji dropped to his knees and laid his swords before him on the floor. " Now I must do what little I can. Jiro, draw your blade." 
   <P align=justify>     Azami rose from his place and went to his father's side. "But Father, you are so strong, you could walk the warrior's pilgrimage yourself after your leg heals."
  <P align=justify>      "No, Azami, I am the founder of the dragonfly school and I must make amends for the failure of my style of teaching. I apologize to you, my heirs, that I have lost our school and our home to my own pride."
    <P align=justify>    "All we need to do is to alter the defensive pattern-"
   <P align=justify>     Jiro struck his younger brother a clout across the face and silenced him. "There is no flaw in Father's style," he whispered. Azami lowered his eyes to the floor and waited, all his options exhausted.
   <P align=justify>     Shinji calmly told them, "I hope you two can improve the dragonfly techniques and regain our honor."
  <P align=justify>      He then drew his short tanto blade from its scabbard at his back and thrust the point deep into his own belly. He twisted the blade quickly and bore it upward to his heart. Jiro's katana flashed through the air, and their father's head tumbled to the bloody floor. 
   <P align=justify>
Azami jerks awake, his hand finding the handle of his katana. He sits up slowly, pulling his blades to him as he gathers up the thin blanket. He pants, the memory fading, his breath steaming in the cold air. He fingers the iron dragonflies on the guards of his two swords, and watches the sun rise on another cold day.
