<P align=justify>
 When I was sent home after my long hospital stay, my limbs had no
strength. My 
hands had lost their flexibility and the slightest effort hurt. My legs
also were very weak. 
After walking a few steps in my room or on the veranda, I had to lie down
again. Even 
raising my body onto the bed was difficult for me. I would sit on the
mattress and move 
my leaden limbs, one at a time, towards me and onto the bed. I needed both
hands to lift 
my legs and both legs to bring in my hands. A friend who saw me in my
weaken state 
said, "Don't give up. You should start strengthening exercises right away
so your body 
won't atrophy".
<P align=justify>
    I was very worried. Several weeks had already passed since my heart
attack and I 
wouldn't regain some of my strength for several more. Later, through all
these days, I 
wouldn't move my body or build my muscles. I could only stretch out utterly
helpless on 
the bed, unable to rise from it. I realized again what a poor guide fear
makes. Without 
properly considering the matter or even asking my doctor, I rashly started
doing the 
vigorous exercises I had done when I was well. But I couldn't raise my
body. I couldn't 
fool it this time. The excruciating pain that immediately resulted cut me
down to size.
<P align=justify>
    My hands hurt so much I couldn't even change the station on the little
radio by my 
bed. My legs ached to the point that every trip to the bathroom and the
shower became 
a journey of affliction. I didn't know which way to turn my back. It hurt
all over, from my 
neck to my buttocks. my muscles became tight and defiant, constantly
sending sharp 
jolts of pain through me. Each time I lowered by legs from the bed and
tried to put on my 
slippers, I fell back exhausted on the verge of tears.
<P align=justify>
    I lay awake at night. My back ached and I couldn't fall asleep. If I
say that I secretly 
cried in the faint glow of the bedroom night light, I wouldn't be
exaggerating. Piteous, 
pathetic citing spells, anxiety, unanswerable questions. I shifted from the
bed  to the 
armchair. I heaped up pillows and built a rampart of blankets on the sides
of the bed. 
Nothing helped. I couldn't find a position in wheach my body could sink
into sweet sleep. 
And if I did find such a position for several minutes, fresh, new aches,
unlike any before, 
would immediately assail me. These new messengers of pain bedeviled me ad
nauseam 
until I broke into sudden, dry, body-wracking sobs, swallowing shameless
tears while 
cursing the modern medicines and my incurable, ancient body. Eventually, I
would return 
to my restless, spasmodic nights.
<P align=justify>
    How long will I suffer like this? I asked myself. How long will I
remain this shell of a man 
too weak to control his limbs? And who had assured me that things would
change for the 
better? It seemed to me during my hours of agony that my condition actually
was 
worsening. How will I be in another month? Next year? Will this torment and
humiliation 
go on forever?
<P align=justify>
    The I remembered the small revolver hidden in the secret dresser
drawer. A beautiful 
piece, an Italian, 22 caliber longbarrel model. I don't know why I thought
of the gun 
during my tortured nights. Sure, I'd had perverse thoughts unclear even to
me. I have a 
fear, which I hesitate to commit to print, that my time as a healthy man in
full control of 
his body had not only passed but brought to mind the hidden revolver. In
several open 
but disjointed talks with my wife, I wondered weather the little gun had
been moved. 
These questions obviously worried my wife, who immediately warned me against 
wayward thoughts and rash actions. But she didn't touch the gun. Was it
different for 
her, too, to accept the changes in my body? Had she still failed to notice
the lost use of 
my limbs? had she never considered, as I had, the great significance and
danger of the 
small gun in the dresser? Did she suddenly have the same inkling I had of
new depths 
that had never crossed her mind before? Had she finally realized, just as I
had, the need 
to put this threatening toy out of the sick man's reach?
<P align=justify>
    The gun, however, was in its place. no one had touched it, swathed in
the same old 
shirt of soft, fraying cloth, since the day I'd returned from the hospital.
Since the gun was 
wrapped in cloth, I couldn't work the holster zipper. The clips were strewn
nearby. I'd 
forgotten only the location of the box of bullets, but the ammunition
didn't interest me 
during my first days home from the hospital. I was as happy with the small
gun as a boy 
with a prize toy. I drew the pistol from its wrapping, wiped away the fine
layer of grease 
and discovered anew a gun fancier's pleasure in weapons. The Italian
workmanship was 
splendid, the staining flawless and the ease of grip excellent. With few
parts, no gun was 
simpler to take apart and assemble. Cleaning the gun, disassembling it and
examining 
the trigger and sights distracted me from my pain.
<P align=justify>
    I suddenly brimmed with so much renewed strength, I was able to lie
down on the 
edge of the bed across from the large mirror in the bedroom wardrobe.
Relieved of my 
suffering, I simply indulged myself in a childish love of my revolver. I
gripped it in my 
hand, waved it, spun it around my extended finger. Where had all my pains
gone? I 
behaved like a teenager. Behind the shelter of my locked door, I carefully
aimed  the 
gun in my small room at the image of myself reflected in the mirror. I
closed one eye, 
opened it again and then squeezed the trigger ever so slowly. After that, I
inhaled 
deeply into my chest and then vigorously blew the air out of my mouth just
as I had seen 
in the movies, when you don't know whether to be awed by the wanted man's
bold 
heroics or to laugh at his infantile terror.
<P align=justify>
    Finally, I pulled the trigger. A bullet suddenly discharged and my
reflection in the 
wardrobe mirror splintered. The bullet pierced the thin wooden door,
rustling my wife's 
dresses hanging inside the cabinet. From the bedroom wall came a muffled
thud. Did 
this actually occur during my recuperation or might I here be confusing
this with an 
embarrassing event that occurred some years earlier? Inside the wardrobe
swirled a 
small cloud of dust.S In panic, I imagined smoke also rising from the
barrel of the 
revolver in my hand. But my eyes deceived me. The acrid smell of gunpowder 
permeated the room with the aroma of scorched cloth. 
<P align=justify>
    Did I really turn pale when my wife wrenched the smoking gun from my
hand? Were 
my hands really shaking? Did I grind my clenched teeth on one another? Was
I laboring 
to breathe? Has my small pistol been absent from the room since that
unfortunate 
discharge?
<P align=justify>
    It seems to me that all these things and more are nothing but memories.
Long ago, in 
the peak of health, I once really did sit opposite the large mirror in the
wardrobe, 
cleaning my gun after an enjoyable time hunting rabbits in the groves. I
was careless for 
some reason, loaded the gun and aimed it, entirely in jest without any
sinister intentions, 
at my forehead reflected in the mirror. I forgot loading the gun, drew a
bead and fired. 
Or perhaps that didn't happen. So many years have passed and my memory often 
misleads me. And there are no marks in either the room or the wardrobe.
it's impossible 
to recognize anything since the renovation. Maybe I only wanted to clean
the barrel. 
Maybe I put a round in the chamber and forgot that I was at home, not in
the groves 
nearby horsing with a friend. And maybe it was a case of plain criminal
negligence here, 
you can call it unintentional recklessness. I just don't remember anymore.
<P align=justify>
    But my wife's best dresses, in fact, were damaged. Luckily for us, the
concrete back 
wall blocked the bullet. Oh, I diligently searched for it that day, but I
didn't find it. I 
remember removing all the dresses and shirts and emptying the wardrobe.
Bored in the 
wall was a small hole spewing a puff of plaster. I should have given the
wardrobe a good 
cleaning to wipe it from view and erase the conspicuous traces left by the
mysterious 
shooting. 
<P align=justify>
    Several weeks later, I happened to find the flattened lead slug. I was
sitting down, 
excited as usual by the sight of my wife's body while she dressed in front
of the pierced 
mirror. As she shook her blouse, the bullet dropped to the floor. I pounced
on it at once, 
thrust it before my wife's astonished eyes , and said, "You see, we've
rounded up the 
last witness to the crime." I kept it for a long time in my drawer among
the odds and ends 
I've saved from critical periods of my life. The holy lira note of a
Hasidic rebbe given to 
me, at the crossing to Lebanon, by young Habadnic members vociferously
evading their 
army service; a checked card with letters I couldn't read, which I received
in the Galilee 
as an amulet from a righteous beggar at Honi's Cave in Hatzor; an old
jackknife that I 
swore I wouldn't pull out of my pocket until the war ended; and other such
things. When I 
started to arrange my drawer some time ago, however, I couldn't find the
squashed 
bullet. Had it known that I would need it so much during my painful months of 
recuperation, it might have done me a favor and not disappeared somewhere
between 
the cracks.
<P align=justify>
    In my mind, I can't decide whether I harbored a secret, demented notion
to perform 
that quaint act of negligence. Nor do I know whether my sudden need for my
small 
revolver signaled that I was about to do something wicked. I'm not brave
enough for that. 
But my wife clearly remembered the shattered mirror and the burning hole in
her dress. 
My flimsy explanation - that I had planned to start hunting rabbits in the
groves again to 
aid my recovery - didn't satisfy her.
<P align=justify>
    Several days after handling my gun, I wanted to withdraw it again from
its niche and 
play with it awhile to distract me during a relapse. The hidden drawer in
the dresser, 
however, was empty. The unzipped holster, made of coarse, stiff canvas, was
nowhere 
to be found. When I asked my wife what had become of my small gun, and
whether she 
could imagine how hurt I was when I discovered it missing, she only said:
"Don't worry, 
it's not lost. It's here. But we've taken it away until you get better.
It's alright, you'll find it 
when you're stronger. We've just moved it to a safe place. So you won't be
tempted 
again, God forbid, to blast your reflection in the mirror."
