<P>You know the feeling. It comes over you suddenly at 4
a.m. in the morning. And why it comes, who knows?</P>

<P>Gotta get up and write!</P>

<P>The thoughts are coursing through my brain, coming
just as fast as I can move the keys on my computer 
keyboard.</P>

<P>There's almost a rhythm as I "click" "click" "click"
away.</P>

<P>Then it's done. I log off the computer and climb back
into bed.</P>

<P>It would be frustrating to be awakened that way, but
I've just created a "masterpiece". </P>

<P>So . . . </P>

<P>So what?</P>

<P>I fall back asleep. And it's over.</P>

<P>I just experienced the "write mood"!</P>

<P>Funny how it only comes once in awhile and sometimes
at the most bizarre times . . .</P>

<P>. . . like when you're away from the computer
riding in your car.</P>

<P>What do you do? Pull over to the side of the road and
start writing?</P>

<P>Or while you're at the movie theater. </P>

<P>While everyone else is out purchasing popcorn, you're
doing what?</P>

<P>Why frantically scratching away in a notebook
you just happened to bring with you for this very
purpose.</P>

<P>Then at night it happens again . . .</P>

<P>While I'm laying there in bed with my wife.</P> 

<P>"Sorry dear, gotta get up and write," I say calmly,
as I climb up out of bed. </P>

<P>Not exactly the words she wanted to hear!</P>

<P>Don't know if she understands it yet. This kind of
thing only seems to happen to writers.</P>

<P>Next day while helping my son with his homework -bam-
I've got it again!</P>

<P>"Sorry, I'll be right back," I tell him. He frowns.</P>

<P>A half an hour later I'm back.</P>

<P>"What took you so long, dad?"</P>

<P>"Oh, I had to write something down," I explain, again
trying to switch gears, but the write mood is still with 
me.</P>

<P>He just rolls his eyes and we're back on the homework.</P>

<P>Have you ever tried to listen to a speaker give his
talk with the "write mood" surging through your veins?</P>
<P>
The speaker is up there talking away at a hundred
miles an hour and the only thing you hear is the 
screech-scratching sounds as you scribble away in your 
notebook.</P>

<P>He's oblivious to what you're doing and you're
oblivious to what he's saying.</P>

<P>It always seems to amaze me how the "write mood" 
never seems to come when you want it to. Have you ever
noticed that?</P>

<P>You can sit at the computer keyboard staring into the
screen for an hour or two . . . and nothing.</P>

<P>But just when you get up to use the bathroom, BOOM,
it hits you! You're in the "write mood".</P>

<P>Can't fight mother nature.</P> 

<P>But can't use toilet paper to write on, either,
so it's a frantic search for my notebook and then a
mad dash to the you-know-where.</P>

<P>I know, I can complain and complain about it (the
mood) hitting me at the most inconvenient times. But, the 
truth be known, I'm really quite grateful that it hits me 
at all!</P>

<P>Afterall, those are the times when I'm at my best.
Those are the times when I'm writing away. Those are the 
times when my mind is most clear.</P>

<P>Those are the times when I write my best copy!</P>

<P>Those are the times when I churn out crazy little
articles like this one!</P>
