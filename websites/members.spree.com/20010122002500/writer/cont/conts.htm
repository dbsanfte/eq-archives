The writer grew up in the Mississippi delta to become a rolling stone and a
journalist.  The profession allowed him the opportunity to travel a
considerable amount of the planet and live in such diverse places as Miami,
Guam, London, New York and Tokyo.  He has made the pilgrimage to Graceland,
toured Imelda Marcos' closet, resisted the urge to flip a coin on the
cadaver's forehead at Lenin's tomb, and drank rum with the deceased
Hemingway while watching the sunrise over the writer's grave in Idaho.  He
reacted to his mid-life crisis by dropping out and buying a historic and
dilapidated old hotel on a remote Florida barrier island in the Gulf of
Mexico.  The experience provided him with plenty of colourful characters
and background for his writing endeavours.  It also drove him nuts. 
Recovered now, he lives in Frankfurt, Germany, where he is an excellent
houseboy for his Yorkshire wife Raspberry Tart when he is not hanging out
with his friend The Real Kramer in Manhattan.  He wishes he could live
underwater.  He spends his days contemplating the ashes of his faithful
basset hound Bernard, seeking inspiration and hoping he can write something
worthwhile before he gets sucked into the cosmic hereafter.

<P>I am a native American, now living in Singapore and enjoying a new
country.</P>
<P>I began writing in school, and then lost the knack when career
needs began to take all my time. Now that I am older, and have slowed down a
bit, I began jotting things down, here and there. Then at the urging of
friends, I put some of my poems online, and then the next thing I knew, I had
a small "following" of fans. My poems can be found on a couple of
commercial websites, promoting relationships, a card site, as well as my own
personal webpage. My webpage "ramblings" also got me an offer to write a
regular magazine column, and I have a weekly newsletter I have started, and
another one in the planning.</P>
<P>Here in Singapore, besides adjusting to a differnet climate and
culture, I
am working in a special school for children. I write when I can, as
much as
I can, and enjoy it so much that it suprises me when someone else
likes what
I've written.</P>

<IMG src="http://members.spree.com/writer/cont/chris.gif" align=right>
<P>Inspired by the lyrics of 60s and 70s era musicians, such as the Beatles, Rolling Stones, and Led Zeppelin, Chris Sorrenti started writing poetry at age 15 as a means of dealing with the pressures of adolescence, and has been hooked ever since. 
</P>
<P>A long time resident of Ottawa, Canada, Sorrenti first joined the local writing community in 1989, reading regularly on the open sets of Orion and Tree. He also participated on the executive of the latter from 1992 to 1994. Chris had his first full reading at Tree in April of 1993. In 1994, he took a three year sabbatical from the social side of poetry to recharge his batteries and spend more time on his own writing. Since then, he has slowly been making a comeback, participating once again in the Juryroom workshop, as well as a member of Sasquatch's advertising sub-committee.
</P>
<P>Chris' work has been published in several of the now defunct World Of Poetry anthologies in the United States, locally in Bywords, as well as in Rob McLennan's Free Verse Anthology (1993). In 1997, Sorrenti published a chap booklet, titled Pillow Poems, through Black Squirrel Press. In October 1999, upon invitation, his poem Super Nova appeared in the Australian (Canberra) arts newspaper, Muse. 
</P>
Much of his work is now available to read on the Internet at http://www.Pathetic.org<BR>
Chris is presently working on a new manuscript of poems, titled, 
Venus, Mars And Everything In-between.
