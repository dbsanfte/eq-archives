	<P>What do you call a person who sees things that don't exist. 
Crazy, huh? Well, what do you call a person who sees things 
that don't exist YET? How about a person who sees a 
nonexistent amusement park in the middle of a uninhabited 
Florida swamp...then proceeds to make it happen? Walt Disney!</P>

<P>We all know of people who 'see' a vision of something that 
hasn't happened yet or doesn't exist yet. We call them 
visionaries. Yet we all have this capability. You, too, can 
be a visionary, by using the same skills you use when you 
remember something. When you remember, you recall images, 
smells, textures, feelings and sounds. Inside your head, you 
see, feel, smell,touch and hear things remembered just as if 
it were really happening again now.</P>

<P>Imagine how useful it would be if you could remember the 
future. Instead of just recalling the past, you could 
remember things that haven't happened yet. Actually, many of 
us do this already... we call it 'worry'. Think about what 
we do when we worry about something. In our minds, we 
imagine all sorts of bad things happening. Often, we can see 
these imagined events clearly taking place, and then we see 
all the terrible side effects.</P>
<P>
Worry is a complete waste of imagination. Mark Twain said 
"most of my life's worst experiences never actually happened". 
Instead, what if we use our brain's talent for imagining 
things happening to plan more effectively. In her 
autobiography, Grandma Moses said "What a strange thing is 
memory and hope. One looks backward and the other forward". 
Let's use our imaging skills to help produce positive results.</P>

<P>Olympic athletes do it all the time. Last summer, as you 
watched the Olympic games from Atlanta, you may have noticed 
how many of the athletes interviewed talked about how they 
'visualize' their event. Long before the actual event, they 
practice by imagining themselves winning their event. And they 
do it in complete detail. Inside their heads they picture 
themselves at the starting line. Then they imagine they hear 
the starter's gun. Next, they feel themselves coming up out of 
the starting blocks and starting to run. They feel the track 
beneath their feet, hear the roar of the crowd, see the finish
line ahead of them. Finally, they picture themselves breaking 
the tape, feeling joyous and triumphant and being 
congratulated by all their fellow athletes.</P>

<P>All this is called 'visualizing'. It is the same as 
remembering the event before it happens, so you can plan 
exactly what you want to do. You can use this skill to plan 
how to accomplish what you want. You can also use it to 
prepare to deal with problems if and when they arise (a much 
better approach than just worrying).</P>

<P>If you are new to visualization, here is a way to practice. 
Go get a glass full of water. Look at it carefully, noticing 
all the details. Now, shut your eyes and try to continue to 
see the glass full of water in your mind. You may need to 
open your eyes a couple times to get a glimpse of the 'real' 
glass of water. Keep at it until you can clearly see the 
glass of water in your mind.</P>
<P>
Next, visualize the glass again with less water. Open your 
eyes, the glass is full; close your eyes and the imaginary 
glass is partially empty. Keep at it until you can readily 
bring up the image of the partially full glass.</P>

<P>How can you make this picture in your mind come true? You 
could drink some of the water from the real glass. You could 
pour some, let it evaporate, or give some away. There are 
often many approaches to making an imagined situation come 
true.</P>

<P>What possibilities does that open to us? What if we could 
picture our future the way we prefer it to be? If you can 
remember the future, you can create a plan to get you there. 
This is called Proactive Futuring. There are three kinds of 
people in this world:</P>

<LI>* those who MAKE things happen - Inventors,</li>

<LI>* those who WATCH things happen(and complain) - Resentors,</LI>

<LI>* those who don't know what's happening - Consentors</LI>

<P>Invent your own future. Decide what you want, your preferred
future, then use visualization as your key to actualization. 
Turn your daydreams into your 36 month view, in your mind's 
eye, of your business and your life. You can always be 
successful in your imagination. Then you can develop a 
specific plan of action toward your goals, including 
contingency plans for possible barriers.</P>

<P>This is truly a case of 'what you see (visualize) is what you 
get'. Imagination is a preview of life's coming attractions.
</P>
<P>Remember, it's your future.</P>
