	<P>After oneself the biggest difficulty that is encountered as soon
as one wants to change any habit, eating included, is the others.
Don't think that it's a matter of objective malicious intent that
aims at you in particular, but people, and you are an integral
part of them, need to define you before accepting you. You
often act in this same way without noticing it: this person is
kind or aggressive, fat or thin, dynamic or lymphatic… This
rating enables you to integrate her more easily in your living
space.</P>

<P>You may already have met somebody that makes you feel ill at
ease because you can't really make him out. In much the same
way, when you change your habits you first unsettle your family
circle and people close to you, and to a lesser extent anyone that
will consider your new behavior is anomalous.</P>

<P>Our society, just as the human body, lives in constant
homeostasis (tries to keep a constant equilibrium). It fights any
change, especially if it's a sudden change, because it's destabilizing.
When you will begin changing your eating habits and showing an
unusual behavior, you'll no doubt be "attacked" with a lot of
genuine advice, and mainly by your circle of friends. Accept their
behavior from the outset because in fact you are the aggressor,
you are the one who is disrupting their habits, you are the one who
is destabilizing their traditional behavior, the only one they
learned to accept as universal truth. You are changing and they are
not going to wonder whether their behavior is wrong.</P>

<P>It is much easier to tell themselves that you are mistaken, to
protect their inner cores. You would have acted the same way with
them. Does this mean that you must get on the wrong side of your
friends and the society just because you want to change your eating
behavior? Not in the slightest, if you understood and accepted that
any living organism has its own momentum, human society in this
instance. Try instead at first to form a protective filter around
you, made up of some family members and true friends, maybe
even some office colleagues. Tell them about your plans, ask for
their help, and more than anything to do you the favor not feel
sorry for you or to tease you about your efforts (you know the
type: "poor child! It hurts me to see you eat that"). Ask them to
encourage you instead.</P>

<P>Carry out this experiment; if you humbly ask a "normal" person
for her help and advice, she won't refuse it to you. On the
contrary, flattered, she will forget her aggressiveness and will
become your best ally in your plan.</P>

<P>Try to convert people to your ideas; it is when you have to explain
a subject to others that you learn it the best. It is as a couple or as a
family that you can best manage to achieve your goals. As the
saying goes: united we stand, divided we fall. Even if your friend,
husband, wife or family doesn't have to slim down, a change for a
healthier diet and lifestyle can only be beneficial to them. Involve
them therefore in your project for their own good.</P>
