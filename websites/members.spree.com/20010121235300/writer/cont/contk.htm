<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#804000" SIZE="-1">I was born in "South Philly" Pennsylvania and now reside in Southern
               New Jersey. After high school graduation I became a mother and a wife.
               At the time, my dream career was to be a lawyer. I figured the best
               place to start would be as a paralegal so off to school I went for
               certification. A friend of mine gave me a job right after school and I
               worked in the legal field for a few years. It was very upsetting when
               I realized that I didn't have the stomach to handle the career which
               was my dream for so long. There would have to be some other way to
               achieve the justice that I so desperately searched for in my life. 

               After my divorce I drifted around for a few years trying to find
               myself while taking care of my young daughter. I was stuck and just
               barely getting by. Then I met a wonderful man while waiting tables at
               a diner and a beautiful relationship was started. We married after 6
               months knowing that we were meant to betogether. He has given me that
               chance to look inside myself and concentrate on all the healing that
               needed to be done. Our 6th wedding anniversary is June 26, 1999. 

               I have had several years of therapy to deal with all the horror I "put
               away" during my childhood. The process has been very enlightening. Out
               of all the pain and sorrow came a spiritual, caring, forgiving and
               centered woman. The gift of creativity has always been part of my life
               but I learned how to use it to heal. Writing and drawing about my pain
               taught me that I could be less and less afraid of it. I always worried
               that some day the ability to create would leave me. Now I know that it
               is a permanent part of me. In all the growth that has occured, I found
               a passion for living and I now see beauty in this world, a world which
               was once filled only with pain, confusion and a huge sense of
               injustice. 

               I hope that my writing may instill a sense of hope in those that feel
               hopeless and a glimmer of trust. Trust in that the world can be a
               truly wonderful place for all of us

<P> My husband, Allen, is a Messianic
rabbi and a
senior staff accountant with Precision Response Corporation in
Miami, 
Florida.We have two grown sons and a grandson, who also live in
Miami.</P>

<P>I am an artist, a musician, and a writer.</P>
<P>
Boy, that all sounds so formal and dull. Now, here's the way I feel
about all 
that.</P>

<P>First, my husband...he's terrific and you can read about him in
some of my 
poetry.  We've been married longer than I am old--which is quite a
trick huh?</P>

<P>And speaking of old, which is something I don't do often, I don't
intend to 
grow old gracefully. As some commercial once stated,  I don't
intend to grow 
old at all! I want to stay young and I'm praying God will help me.
Right now 
my children are older than I am. I don't know how it happened.
Maybe someone 
will come up with a 'face-lift--body--lift--one a day pill'. What
do you 
think?</P>

<P>On a more serious note, I love the arts and I feel that God gave me
gifts to 
be used for Him; to praise Him and bless people. I'm working at it.</P>

<P>I spent a lot of my life being sick and suffering. Not complaint,
just fact. 
Now, I want to share in my writing, art, and music what I gained
(yes gained) 
by going through the experiences. And I have to say that 'through '
is the 
operative word. God has healed me and I am so glad to be better.</P>
