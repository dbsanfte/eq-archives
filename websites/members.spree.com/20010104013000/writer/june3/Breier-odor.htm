	<P>	Brett looked out of his bedroom window and noticed that it had rained during the night.  Pressing his face to the window he could already sense the sweet scent of damp asphalt and dew-covered weeds.  The sky was dark and gray.  It looked like there might be more rain.  When he left for work, Brett brought his umbrella.</P>
	<P>	He walked down the street and turned right onto Richmond Terrace.  He looked over his left shoulder and stared at Lower Manhattan across New York Harbor as he walked.  It was gorgeous and fantastic, no matter how often he saw it.  In the light just before the sun rose there it stood, with its towers and their rooms lit random, the choppy water of the harbor reflecting hints of Manhattan's light, disturbed at that hour only by the tankers coasting into the Arthur Kill waterway that separated Staten Island from New Jersey.</P>
	<P>Brett was so profoundly amazed by what he saw on that morning, he walked into the pond that formed on Richmond Terrace whenever there had been a steady and heavy rain.  His feet sank down and the water encased them just under his ankle.  Brett stomped his feet into the pond and jumped back, clear of the water.</P>
	<BR><hr><BR>
	<P>He was a clerk on the floor of the American Stock Exchange and needed to prepare his post for the broker before the market would open at nine thirty.  It was a quarter to eight and Brett couldn't miss the next ferry.  He looked out to the harbor and saw the Staten Island Ferry pulling into the terminal.  Brett needed to hurry.</P>
	
	<P>A creature of habit, he couldn't fathom crossing the street to where the pond didn't reach.  He never walked that way.  So he plodded through with a sluggish jog, hoping that with the force of each step he would push the water aside; then lift each step quickly enough so he would miss the rush of returning water.  It worked for only one step, but he had begun and didn't want to stop, so he quickened his pace, hoping that this might help, but he couldn't avoid the water, it's grasp, its hold of him.  He stopped still in the pond but near the end, feet immersed in water.</P>
	<P>Brett saw the curb sticking out of the water where the pond began to die.  He lifted one foot and waited a moment until he was sure of his balance, then leapt forward and landed on the curb.  He looked over to where people had stopped walking on the dry side of the street so that they could watch Brett hop through the water.  When Brett looked over at them, they continued toward the terminal and so did Brett, making a quick pit stop at the donut shop to get a cup of coffee for his ride over the harbor.</P>
	<BR><hr><BR>
	<P>	Brett sat on the west-facing balcony of the ferry.  He took out his copy of <I>The New York Time</I>s, placed the business section on the seat next to him and opened the paper to the op-ed page.  He only looked up from the paper as the boat passed the Statue of Liberty and as the ferry took a right turn and briefly traveled along lower Manhattan.  After the ferry docked, Brett walked down State Street and did as he always did; stopped at the beginning of Broadway so he could turn around and gaze at the Old Customs House.  After a few short moments, Brett continued up Broadway for a few blocks and turned left onto Rector Street, slowing down so he could roll his eyes over Trinity Church.  He loved the sight of that church, surrounded by all the metal and glass in the near distance, especially since the black soot had been sandblasted off of its outside walls.</P>
	<P>	Then came the most confusing sight to Brett, confusing in that he wasn't sure why he was drawn to it.  There was something he despised about it whenever he saw it, not a beautiful monument, and it was certainly nothing more than a speck of a structure against the background of Trinity Church; Alexander Hamilton's tombstone.  The tombstone was on the south side of the grounds of the church and so was situated in a space looking over Rector Street.  Rector Street was a hill that descended when one walked onto it from Broadway.  Often when walking down that hill, Brett would crane his neck around with wide owl eyes and stare at the tombstone for as long as the wrought-iron fence would allow it to be seen; after the tombstone was out of sight, Brett would squint his eyes and dare to catch a glimpse of it between the rungs of the fence.  The tombstone was shaped like a pyramid, with a point at the top which Brett always took to be a sole eye fixed upon him.</P>
	<P>Brett could have taken a more direct route from the ferry terminal to Greenwich Street and then directly to the back door of the exchange, however, this whole convoluted route always enticed Brett.  However, somewhere within his soul, he preferred to have the tip of the tomb stare at him as he descended to his place of work.</P>
	<P>Walking down Rector Street with his head turned around, Brett collided with someone who was walking in the opposite direction; heading up.  Brett could never understand where the people were coming from when he bumped into them.  Where could they be going?  Why go up that hill?  This didn't always break his trance.  Sometimes Brett would stumble around while regaining his balance, mumble sorry words of apology, and continue down, however, this time the trance was broken.  He stopped in his tracks and looked around; found his bearings.  Brett felt the emptiness of hunger and felt in his pocket for money.  He continued on, passing the coffee shop, realizing that he was without any cash to buy his usual bagel and coffee breakfast.  His commute complete, Brett entered through the back door.</P>
	<BR><hr><BR>
	<P>	"Again?" they roared with laughter.</P>
	<P>	"Yeah, <I>again </I>guys," Brett answered with a smile as he ran paper towels over the cuffs of his pants.  He stopped drying himself so he could begin to prepare his post for the broker; which was getting harder with each moment, having to constantly stop to humor the people coming by with their offerings of water in glasses.</P>
	<P>	After all of the preparation work for the opening of the market was completed, the broker arrived and the market opened.  It took nearly forty minutes to open all of the stocks on their board.  The broker then looked down at the damp and stained cuffs of Brett's pants and asked "What happened?"</P>
	<P>	"I got caught in a puddle."</P>
	<P>	"Hasn't that already happened to you?"</P>
	<P>	"Yeah."</P>
	<P>	"Shit man, don't you learn?"</P>
	<P>	"Well, I get caught-up sometimes, ya' know?  I was staring at the twin towers, in the light, surrounded by all those other buildings-"</P>
	<P>	"I don't know anything about that," the broker replied, "but I see a couple 'a twins right <I>now.</I>"  The broker then took off his wedding band, slipped it into his pocket, and turned to face Brett.</P>
	<P>	"Can you handle everything by yourself for a little bit?" the broker asked.</P>
	<P>	"I don' know, I wanted to get something for breakfast."</P>
	<P>	"Aaaaaah<I> maaaaaaan</I>, come on."</P>
	<P>	"Wait a minute, let me get a cup of coffee first."</P>
	<P>	"Nah, she's gonna walk away!"</P>
	<P>	"But I haven't eaten <I>anything</I> yet today."</P>
	<P>	"Lunch is gonna be brought down in like twenty minutes man, here, have my coffee, I didn't even have any yet."</P>
	<P>	"Alright.  Just hurry, alright?"</P>
	<P>	"Yeah.  I'll hurry for you."</P>
	<P>	"Yeah, sure," Brett replied, knowing that lunch wasn't going to arrive for another three hours.</P>
	<P>	The broker twice jerked his eyebrows, donned a wide toothy smile and darted out of the booth.</P>
	<P>Three hours later one of the boss's sons came to the floor with lunch ordered for the entire firm.  Brett found his sandwich and soda in the box and also took lunch for Harry.  Harry was a broker for the firm.  Brett didn't get to work directly with Harry but enjoyed talking to him.  Harry had been working for the firm for over thirty years.</P>
	<P>"Maybe I just should've done what my buddy Sam did," Brett said to himself out loud, standing next to Harry.</P>
		
	<P>"Oh yeah?  What's that?" asked Harry.</P>
	<P>Brett chewed, swallowed, and said, "He's a high school teacher."</P>
	<P>"And what makes <I>that</I> such a good job?"</P>
<P>	"I don't know.  He certainly gets home a hell of a lot sooner than I do."</P>
	<P>"Really?  Well, I once wanted to be a teacher."</P>
	<P>"Really?  No kidding."</P>
	<P>"No.  No kidding.  When I was in college I majored in history, yeah, I thought I'd be a teacher."
</P>
<P>		"Well, I minored in English and I <I>wanted</I> to be here at the exchange.   How'd <I>you</I> end up here?" Brett asked.
</P>	<P>"Brett, let me answer your question with a question."</P>
	<P>"Go ahead."</P>
<P>	"Do you know anybody my age who likes his job?"</P>
	<P>Brett looked up, cocked his head and said, "Actually, no."</P>
	<P>"Well, neither do I, but at least I'm a millionaire, right?"</P>
<P>	And they both chuckled a manly chuckle.  They had something between them; Harry taught Brett a lesson of life, or so Harry thought.  However, whatever lesson might have been taught was not the one intended because immediately after their chuckle, Brett looked at Harry's blue shirt with its white starched collar.  Brett looked at Harry's head with its greased back hair.  He noticed Harry's diamond cufflinks and looked at his suspenders with their gold plated locks holding the pants up just over his extended but respectful belly for a man of his age and wealth.  </P>
<P>So, Brett thought, here we both are, regardless of what we wanted.</P>	
	<P>Brett left his lunch on the work counter and walked to the bathroom.  He stood at the urinal and took his penis into his hand.  He looked down.  He tried hard to pee, relaxed his legs and ass, took deep long breaths, but there was only a slight trickle.  He very much wanted to pee.  He wanted a good reason to be in the bathroom and away from Harry.  He stood there holding himself, though no more urine trickled forth, wondering whether he should go and smoke a cigarette, stay in the bathroom and go to a stall so he could masturbate, go eat the rest of his lunch, anything to lighten his spirit.</P>
<P>His feet were still wet inside the shoes.</P>	
	<BR><hr><BR>
	<P>	Brett left the bathroom and walked back toward his booth.  His feet squished.  Off to the left he saw two guys with whom he had gone to high school.  They hadn't spent any time with each other during their years in school, but Brett was desperate.</P>
<P>		"Hey guys, what's doin'?"
</P>	<P>"All right Brett, nothing much, you?"
</P>	<P>"Nothing much," Brett said and gazed out to the floor and said, "you know how it is"
</P>
	
	<P>	"Fuck man, tell me 'bout ithey Brett, you got any on you?" one of the guys asked as he sniffed definitely and lightly and with thumb and forefinger, the entire action taking only a second, squeezed his nostrils shut and caressed his thumb and forefinger down over the nostrils until they pinched just under his nose.</P>
<P>	
	"Naw manI don't do that anymorehigh school's over," Brett said in reply to the gestured request.
</P>	
<P>	"Over?  I started when I got <I>here</I>."</P>	
<P>"Well," Brett said, "I don't know man, I just don't do it anymore.  Take it easy."  He walked away without waiting for them to say goodbye.  He had found no solidarity, so Brett made his way back to the booth.</P>	
<P>
Two men and a woman were talking on the other side of the booth when Brett arrived.  "What did ya think about it?" one of them asked Brett.
</P>	
<P>	"You really care?" Brett asked.</P>	
<P>	"Yeah, sure, why not?"</P>	
<P>	"OK, well, I'm thinking about wishes."  They both stared at him.  "I wonder if people wish for the same thing every time they make a wish, until it comes true," Brett continued, "or if they make a different wish each time, I" and he was cut off.</P>	
<P>"What in the<I> FUCK</I> are you <I>tawkin'</I> about?  I asked you what you thought about <I>it.  IT</I> man, <I>not what are you thinking</I>, well, what did ya think?"</P>	
<P>	"About what?"</P>	
<P>	"About the fuckin' <I>Knicks</I> game, wholly<I> shit</I>!  Where the fuck <I>are</I> you man?"</P>	
<P>	"Oh, I don't know, I mean, I don't really watch basketball."</P>	
<P>	"Really?  Wow, who would've ever guessed?"</P>	
<P>	"Yeah, well, really," Brett replied as the group of three all smiled and looked back at each other.</P>	
<P>Brett made squishy feelings with his wet feet.  His toes tensed tight, he looked to the side, then turned around so his back would face the people.  Staring at the screen screaming stock prices and index figures, Brett released his toes.</P>	
<BR><hr><BR>
<P>	A half an hour after the market closed Brett finished with his clerical duties.  He left the exchange and walked back toward the Staten Island Ferry.  He didn't retrace his route of the morning.  He never did.  Instead, he walked along Greenwich Street directly to Battery Park.  Then walked along the benches on the edge of the park toward the ferry terminal.  It was never long after he left the exchange that Brett would reach the park.  Once he got to the park, the ferry terminal was clear in his view for the remainder of his trip.</P>	
<P>	
He walked toward the terminal and grew weary.  He slowed to a motion indistinguishable from standing still.  As he had watched the terminal grow larger with each quick step, he at once realized with what severe verve with which he had been walking.  The terminal grew too large too fast and he had to slow himself down.
</P>	
<P>Brett heeded to the calls and shoves of all the homeward bound commuters and stepped aside.  He stood near the row of benches while still facing the terminal.  He was stuck between the line of benches with alternately seated tourists and homeless people and the river of people on their way home; all moving so quickly.  Brett couldn't be sure in which realm he belonged, or at the very least, which one he should dwell in for that moment.</P>	
<P>Standing there, feeling the breeze which followed the herd of people, sensing the calm of Battery Park to his right, Brett felt torn.  He wanted to go home and he wanted to sit down and he yearned to scream at both desires.  Brett felt dread at both as neither would get him anywhere.</P>	
<P>His disgust grew as he thought of how much faster he got home every day than he would get to work.  Brett stood facing the terminal while his mind traced every step of his monotonous morning journey.  It was disgusting to him.  I should be looking for other places to be, he thought, no for irrelevant <I>things</I> that are already on an unsuccessful way.</P>
<P>Brett resolved to stop his early morning tours of Lower Manhattan.  He resolved to walk a more direct route that, in order to make it a pleasurable journey in and of itself, he would inevitably need to change the destination altogether.  He needed to<I> make</I> the morning trek a route of his own.</P>
<BR><hr><BR>
<P>	Brett stepped successfully into the movement of people.</P>
<P>Immediately after walking through the entrance doors to the terminal, Brett needed to use the bathroom.  He walked in and stood up to a urinal.  He looked up and took his penis into his hand, looked down, took aim, and a steady hot stream shot"mmmmm."</P>
<P>	"Fuck me, DAMMIT," Brett said under his breath as he realized that this was the first piss he had taken all day.  There was a stream of burning pain that made evident the immense pressure he had been obliviously enduring for most of the day.  It was very good to pee.  It smelled like sweet coffee.</P>
<P>	The man in the urinal next to Brett's looked over, after he heard what he thought to have been Brett's request, noticed Brett's smile, turned his head to make himself sure of the location of the door, shook himself quickly, zipped up and walked out.  Brett turned his head to follow him with his eyes and a far away smile.</P>
<P>Just as the man left, Brett noticed another man enter the bathroom.  "Hey, can you spare a buck furrin' ol' fuck?" the man asked.</P>
<P>	Brett pushed and squeezed, squeeze, and squeezed again, shook, zipped and walked out.  The homeless man said to Brett as he passed, "How 'bout it deah buddy, you look happy, spread duh joy, spare a buck furrin' ol' fuck?"</P>
<P>	Brett walked past him.  He was still smiling.</P>
<BR><hr><BR>
<P>	Once Brett returned to his apartment he took his shoes off.  His feet smelled an awful face crunching warm horror of an odor.</P>
<P>	He began to peel off his slightly sweat dampened clothes so he could get in the shower, but he stopped after he had taken off everything except his boxers and he sat on the couch.  He breathed in the odor.  It became sweet to him, a putrid presence that would have been abhorred by those with whom he spent his days; and rightfully so, Brett thought.  It was horrific.  But he had finally come to see what was the scourge of his days, and the presence of that odor rising from his feet wouldn't allow Brett to ignore the epiphany, to push it aside, as he was wont to do, as the result of a solitary bad day.</P>
<P>He crunched up his toes and felt them in their dryness glide gently against each other and on the smooth, warm oak floor.  Brett became slightly excited, the toes felt so good touching each other, against the warm floor, and he saw his excitement through the slit of his boxers, and wondered if he actually wanted the odor to be gone at all, happy in the thought that there was something about which to be happy, and also in the fact that he couldn't share it or give it away even if he had tried.  It was such a pungent presence, a sweet reminder; an odor of his own.</P>
