	<P>Discover The Hidden KEY to making Friends and Building relationships! 
</P>
<P>Would you like to make friends quickly? Do you desire strong
relationships?
Do you wish that people would instantly like you? In this article you
will
discover the hidden key that will allow you to make friends quickly and
create strong relationships.</P>
<P>
What is this key that will allow you to build business contacts, make
friends, and make people want to be around you? The key is this: "MAKE
OTHERS FEEL SIGNIFICANT." That's it! So simple but yet so powerful. 
If you make the other person feel important, he/she will love you and
want 
to build a relationship with you. How do you apply this secret? Below are

many ways in which you can apply this simple principle and reap the
benefits 
many times over.</P>

 <P>When you meet someone, greet them on the phone, or pass them on the
street, act ENTHUSED to meet them! Give them a "winning" smile.
Cheerfully
greet them with "hello (name)". Let your voice show that you are glad to
see
them. What if you DON'T feel like it? Who cares! Act enthusiastic to meet
them and you will BE enthusiastic to meet them, and they will feel
important. They will be glad to see YOU.</P>

<P>You have probably realized that puppies make friends very easily. When
they
greet a person they smile, wag their tail and are absolutely happy to see
you and want to be your friend. The result is that most people love
puppies.</P>

<P>Publicly Praise your friend. This is simple. Say to a coworker or to
Fred
when he is in company "Fred is (you are) doing a really good job with
meeting his deadlines. This will make Fred feel like the "king of the
hill".</P> 

<P> One of the best ways to make a person feel important is to praise him.
I
am not talking about flattery. When you are walking down the street and
see
a person washing windows, say "you are doing a good job". If a friend or
coworker does something good TELL IT TO HIM/HER.</P>

<P>Show appreciation. When someone does something for you, show sincere
appreciation. Say "thanks for the drink of water", "thanks for holding
the
door open, it is very kind of you." The person will walk off with his
head
in the clouds and so will you. One of the keys for a successful marriage
is
showing appreciation for the little things that the one spouse does for
the 
other. Whether it is cooking a good meal, being home on time, or doing a 
good job cleaning, show appreciation.</P>

<P> Acknowledge the other person. If you are walking down the street, or
are
in an elevator, look the person in the eye for a second and say hello.
Make
small talk.</P>

 <P>Let people know you care. Send a person a card when he is sick. Send
an
online greeting card. Ask a person how he/she is doing.</P>

<P> Do something special for the person. Call them. Take them out to eat.
www.WorldsBestFriend.com  has come up with a unique, special and free
way to make a person feel special and to assure they remember YOU.</P>

<P> Maintain eye contact when talking and listening. This shows you care
about the other person and it makes him/her feel important.</P>

<P> This last one is the most important to making friends, and building
relationships. If you apply this, people will love you. Get the other
person
to talk about himself or his interests and then LISTEN. Show interest in
what
the other person is saying, listen and ask questions to keep him/her
talking. 
He/she will love you.</P>
