	<P>Eduard was playing the piano as he usually did after dinner, when
Cook-san ran into the sitting room. Of course, I didn't care if she
came in on the family, but she had very strict rules. Except to
serve us, the servants stayed in their part of the house, which
left us the big luxurious side of the house to ourselves. The flip
side of that was that we weren't to venture into their territory.
So, when Cook-san arrived in our sitting room, we were all
surprised and even mildly alarmed.</P>

<P>"Turn on radio, Mama-san. Emperor speaks. War over."</P>

<P>Of course we all knew that it couldn't go on much longer. Food
supplies had long since given out. The American bombers came over
the hilltop each night and dropped endless loads of bombs on Kobe.
We had heard of even worse destruction in Nagasaki and Hiroshima,
but we didn't actually learn the horrible extent of it for months.
To those Japanese who knew first hand what happened, it was too
horrible to express in words. The government was not anxious to
spread fear, and the rumor mill was strangely quiet.</P>

<P>Ever since the German's surrendered in Europe, the position of all
the German consular and trade personnel had become very tenuous. We
always knew we were being spied upon by our servants, and the
merchants and garbage collectors who came to the house each week,
but we had nothing to hide, so it didn't matter much. </P>

<P>Still now, there were rumors that there was a train waiting in the
station for us to board and that the Japanese government planned to
take us up to the frozen northland and drop us off on some remote
island, without food or shelter to die of exposure. I don't know if
this was true. Strange things happen in war times.
</P>
<P>I ran to the radio and switched it on. I glanced over at Eduard,
still sitting behind the piano. His eyes registered his concern
that they might be announcing our imminent departure by train, or
worse. His consular status had protected us during the war, but now
the Japanese had no love for Germany any more. Anything might
happen.
</P>
<P>A thin wispy voice emerged as the radio warmed up. It seemed just
about as substantial as the flickering light that came up behind
the opaque dial with all its national and international radio
numbers. This high pitched sing-song voice floated out of the tiny
speakers into our living room like a trail of thin smoke or a
single strand of cob web waving listlessly in the air.</P> 

<P>"The emperor, his voice," Cook-san said folding her hands and
bowing excessively as she backed out of our presence. No one had
ever had the privilege of hearing the Emperor's voice outside of
his massive Palace. Only those in the Japanese nobility were
allowed to associate with the Emperor. Even many of them had never
heard him speak. Hearing his voice for the very first time, common
people felt a natural sense of awe and respect, but they did not
know how to act in his radio presence. Evidently bowing was the
only thing they could think that might be appropriate. They all did
it, I found out later from my friends.</P>

<P>We listened very carefully to his voice. Our lives might hang on
what he was saying. He spoke in an ancient form of Japanese only
used inside the Palace grounds. It was unintelligible to us. My tin
ear only picked up a certain amount of Japanese at the best of
times, but even Eduard was puzzled by this antique language.</P>

<P>"Cook-san," I called out to her to her shadow just as it
disappeared around the corner into the kitchen. "Tell us what he is
saying. Translate for us, please. We do not understand." Cook-san
returned still bowing and still with her hands folded in front of
her chest. She cocked her head as he spoke. She squinted slightly.
She was trying very hard.</P>

<P>"I cannot tell, Mama-san," answered Cook-san. "His words are
sacred, and so it is natural that we not understand them." I looked
at Eduard. He shrugged his shoulders. We both looked at Cook-san.
To judge by her expression this was a completely adequate
explanation for his speech. She smiled her usual smile and hurried
out into the kitchen where she could huddle with the other
servants, and not miss a word.</P>

<P>Cook-san's parting glance at me told me that my demand for meaning
in the Emperor's speech seemed to her crass and unworthy of the
moment. She was glad to be able to retreat. I tried to listen with
her ears, and I had to agree with her to some extent. It was
therapeutic to hear the Emperor's steady, confident voice at this
time of crisis. It had a calming effect.</P>

<P>There was great dignity in it. How did he manage to put so much
pride into simple words? Yet a clear sense of honor and moment
emerged from behind his small, wispy stream of words. Listening to
his voice, it did not matter who won or who lost the war. It only
seemed to matter that we lived in a nation with an Emperor such as
this one who could speak and lead with such aplomb. How could
anything important go wrong?</P> 
<P>
No Japanese Emperor had ever announced the defeat of his nation to
his people before. There were no protocols to follow. I suppose if
such a thing has to be done, it is best done with dignity and
serenity and if no one can understand the words, yet the message is
conveyed, while avoiding any petty fighting over terminology. </P>
<P>
After it was all over, Eduard got on his hat and coat, the same hat
and coat he wore on the boat we boarded in San Francisco just
before the war was declared. Ours had been a hot, fast romance. He
was an exchange student and I his English tutor. My mother warned
me about the dangers of going out with a German, but there's no
explaining, or avoiding, love. </P>

<P>"I need to go downtown for a while," he said. "I'll be back as soon
as I can find out what is happening." When we first arrived in
Japan, we were welcomed into the trade delegation with open arms.
Those were the days when we still pretended to have a country club
and a tennis club, though they had no food and less and less liquor
as the war deepened. After a while there weren't even any valuables
left in the club to bribe the band into playing and soon the
colored water in the liquor bottles began to mold over and the
party was over. The croquet balls and mallets were neatly packed
away. The nets were taken down and the clubs were closed forever,
as it turned out.</P>

<P>Eduard had a car and a driver, back then, but the car was lost when
our first house was bombed. The driver had to be let go. I was very
sorry to do it. We were his only source of food, for himself and
his family, but there was no point in having to feed a driver with
the car out of commission.</P>

<P>The second house we lived in was much nicer, but the servants were
not sure if they should be serving us since they never actually
received instructions to that effect from the Lutheran minister who
had taken his family back home at the outbreak of war. They went
across Russia in a locked train, headed for Germany, and we got
back very bad reports about the possibility of their making it all
the way. Still, the servants were loyal to their master's word,
even if their master was in some Siberian labor camp, or worse yet
dead. </P>
<BR><hr><BR>


<P>Eduard hit upon the idea of calling the bishop. He understood
immediately and came right over that very evening. People stuck
together back then more than now. He brought his own head servant,
and, while the bishop chatted with us in the sitting room, the head
man talked with the servants to arrange for our safety and comfort.
While the real business was going on in the kitchen, we pretended
to make polite conversation.</P>
<P>
"Bishop, I'd like to introduce my children," I said formally. "Here
is Robin. He's 6 and here is our darling Susanna, 4."</P> 
<P>
"Nickta suss," I instructed her. Susanna rolled her eyes as she
thought about each step. I could see her reviewing my instructions
word for word. "First grasp the edges of your dress on each side.
Then place the right toe behind the left heel and bent your knees
ever so slightly." She almost lost her balance, but caught herself
at the last minute. When she arose, she almost applauded herself
for having executed her moves without flaw.</P> 

<P>Meanwhile, Robin, unbid, bowed very formally from the waist, one
arm bent across his waistline at the back and one arm bent across
his pudgy front. He wore an enigmatic smile which with any luck the
childless bishop would not be able to translate. His leather short
pants creaked as he bent over.</P>

<P>"And I understand that you are carrying yet a third," he said. I
was only in my third month, and I thought I didn't show as yet, but
gossip is more telling than anything else in these matters, and a
bishop is sure to know everything. Gossip is all we really had to
concentrate on in those days. There was no trade. We weren't
involved in the war effort. All we had time to do was scrounge for
food and gossip. The one we did just adequately, but the other we
became quite expert in.</P>
<P>
"Yes," I replied. "It should be in late June or early July I think.
I have not been able to get to the hospital more than a couple of
times. It is quite a long train ride and a long walk, as you know.
It frightens me to be pregnant among so many desperately ill."</P>
<P>
The bishop nodded, and shifted in his place. At last the bishop's
head man appeared at the kitchen door, his hands clasped
respectfully behind his back. The bishop rose up from the sofa,
where he sat with his hat in his lap the entire time, and dutifully
shook hands with each of us before he left. </P>

<P>"That was a very fine curtsy," young lady," he said in parting to
Susanna, who blushed and ran off toward her room. </P>
<P>
"Good day, bishop," I said to his back. "Thank you very much."</P>

<P>That house was pretty well crushed one night when a bomber dropped
its load prematurely and hit the water reservoir over us. The water
mixed with the dry dust of the hillside and by the time it hit the
house, it was a rolling pile of mud and stones. Luckily Cook-san
was still out for the evening after her day off, and we were all
tucked in bed at the other end of the house. Still, we had to move.
The whole house was leaning precariously. It collapsed entirely
some days later. </P>

<P>Eduard had a strange premonition about that house. On the night of
the misguided bombing run, he got into bed and said altogether
casually that he felt certain that this would be the last night we
would have to sleep in this house.</P>
<P>
"Why," I asked him. He didn't have this sort of intuitive burst
very often, hardly ever.</P>

<P>"I don't know how I know," he replied. "I just feel like our time
is up here."</P>
<P>
"Go to sleep," I said. "You're imagination is getting the better of
you," but somehow he was right.</P>

<P>Eduard returned late with news. The war was over. The Emperor had
given his speech, the text of which was published in the newspaper
in normal Japanese, not that it mattered much. Basically, he said
that he would always be their emperor, which wasn't true, and they
would always be proud and free, which was very soon not true
either. True to Cook-san's report, the importance of the Emperor's
speech had nothing whatever to do with what was said.</P> 

<P>No one knew what was about to happen next. Would the Americans drop
more bombs to neutralize any resistance, or would they come in with
an invading army, guns blazing? It was a time of great uncertainty.
We were safely ensconced in our third and last house for the war
and rid, at last, of that one batch of troublesome servants. They
hung around the leaning corpse of the old house until it collapsed
and then they dispersed. I never saw any of them again. </P>

<P>The last day, as we left, they gathered outside the remains to wish
us farewell. Most of them spoke to us in English, though they had
always before maintained they did not understand the language. The
linen girls and washey girls giggled and poked each other as we
passed down the line shaking their hands and leaving them each with
a small token of our affection. We didn't have many tokens left by
the end of the war. We desperately went through our new house
looking for things that looked like they might have been ours to
give them. They would not have liked it if they knew we were
stealing, but what was the choice? Everything was quite confused.
Every one had to make do as best he could. </P>

<P>Having servants might sound grand from a post-war perspective, but
it was a lot of work feeding all of those mouths. They gladly
provided us with every conceivable service. They cooked and
cleaned, washed and polished. They would stand for hours waiting on
table or attending to the children with utter patience. It didn't
matter how many hours it took to make dinner or how many hands were
needed.</P> 

<P>If I signaled Cook-san in the morning that we were ready for a
number 1 dinner, she lit up like a candle. She gathered all the
servants in the kitchen, and set everyone to chopping and washing
things. All day long, you could hear the happy sound of chatter
throughout the house.</P> 

<P>But if I held up three fingers, as I so frequently had to do at the
end of the war when food was so terribly scarce, Cook-san drew a
very long face and did the Japanese servant equivalent of stomping
off into the kitchen. Today I see many good restaurants where that
is the best level of service available, but to Cook-san a good,
number 1, meal meant that we and the servants and all their
families had a fine dinner to look forward to, but if I signaled a
number 3 meal we all ate sparsely. </P>

<P>Their energy was unbounded, but there was one thing they would not
do, find food. If I gave Cook-san coins she would take a basket and
go to the Black Market where she knew she could negotiate a good
deal for a few yen, but she would not grow or harvest anything.
That was out of the question. Some things were set in stone with
the servants and that was the A-Number-One-Thing. Masters provide
the food.</P>

<P>What that really meant is that Eduard and I had to scrounge and
scramble to find enough food. Since Eduard worked at the embassy
most of the time, that left it up to me. Sometimes Eduard would
take things in his briefcase, like jewelry or brass candlesticks,
and trade these goods in Kobe for a few coins which we could hand
off one at a time to Cook-san for barter. Most times, however, I
would have to spend my afternoons out in the garden hoeing and
raking and watering our little garden. I had to chase away the deer
and rabbits and bring in whatever harvest we managed to eke out of
this dry unlikely land.</P> 
<P>
The servants were very polite about it. They gladly scrubbed the
stains from my garden dresses for hours but they would not help in
any way. That was my work, and I had to see to it myself.</P>

<P>If my crop yielded more than we could consume before it rotted, I
took out a basket and made the rounds of each house in the
district. Maybe I would have a pile of carrots or some spinach. At
each house, I would offer my goods implicitly by settling them down
by my feet as I talked over the news of the day, i.e. the newest
gossip. My hostess might offer me some tea if she had some or just
water if not. We might talk for hours, but eventually the subject
of the carrots and spinach would come up and soon enough a deal
would be struck to every one's agreement. </P>

<P>If my neighbor had no ready-to-eat food to trade she might have
cigarettes which were the only universal currency. God only knows
how many hands these packs that made it all the way through the war
had passed through. As long as the cellophane seal covered the
pack, it was legal tender for all debts public and private. I never
smoked. It was a habit none of us could afford, but we all had
cigarettes hidden away in little secret places where we could find
them when someone came calling with something fresh to eat in a
basket. </P>

<P>I don't know how the Japanese civilians found food. I suppose in
much the same way. Sometimes a young Japanese girl would show up on
my doorstep with a basket of fresh food. She was not begging. This
is how we all had to live. I would give her a pack of cigarettes,
divide the produce into one family units, and begin trading. Though
the end of the war signaled terrible shortages, we always managed
to find some way to get by. People were very kind to one another
during the war. I never had as much trouble being an American
during the war in Japan as I did after I returned to America and
tried to live in Albany with family ties to Germany. 
</P>
<P>One day Eduard and Robin climbed up the hillside behind our house
to watch the City of Kobe explode and burn as the bombs destroyed
it block by block. I stayed down below in the garden. As I stood
there listening as the bombs went off in the distance, I heard a
cry of delight or alarm, I couldn't tell which it was from the
behind 

me. </P>


<P>Cook-san stood in the clearing at the far end of the garden, near
the root -cellar we used when the bombs came too near, and there I
saw her with one hand over her eyebrows. No Japanese planes had
been in the air for weeks. I ran up to the clearing behind her and
saw in the sky what she saw, a shining shaft of polished aluminum
reflecting in the sun. It shone like a piece of sculpture as it
swooped down on the town. It seemed to hover on a whisper.</P>

<P>"It's so fine," Cook-san said. I never got used to the Japanese
sense of beauty. We did not know if this plane was delivering
bombs, troops, or food, but to her it did not matter. She had no
control over these life-and-death matters. There was no sense in
having the beauty of the moment disturbed by any anxiety for what
the future might bring.</P>
<P>
Often in the newspaper a report of a battle was headed with a
picture of a Japanese officer smelling peach blossoms from astride
his horse. Sometimes, later, we discovered that the officer had
been dead for months or even years. Sometimes these same men
returned. It did not matter to the affect the newspaper was trying
to create.</P>

<P>"Kirei des ne," Cook-san shouted pointing into the sky. "It is
beautiful, isn't it?" she repeated, holding out her hand to it as
if biding this silver bird to light on her outstretched finger. It
turned out that the planes that came that day and for many days to
come were loaded with troops and supplies. Soon American servicemen
in Jeeps were seen everywhere. They wore sidearms and some came
with rifles in the jump seat. When they learned that an American
woman was living up in the hills, they came to visit. They came to
speak English, play with the children, and learn about the local
customs. </P>

<P>It was hard to know what terrible circumstances these men endured
before driving up into our barren yard in their Jeeps. Iwo Jima,
the Salomon Islands, and the battles for the other Pacific islands
had all been theirs to fight, and then survive. They all wore brave
faces and did not speak of their inner suffering. Many of them
showed me the pictures of their own children at home. They played
catch with Robin and bounced Susanna on their knees. For a few
moments they seemed happy, and perhaps a little sad at the same
time. </P>
<P>
One day a lieutenant, who came home with Eduard for dinner, gave
Susanna a single cube of sugar after dinner.</P>

<P>"Ohhhhh!" she exclaimed. "Mama look!" She cried out in utter
delight holding the cube above her head where I could see it
plainly. "Isn't it wonderful!" The soldier was amused. He couldn't
be expected to know that we had not seen actual sugar for several
years. Even the beet substitutes gave out months ago. Here it was,
a perfect square of crystalline hope, a hallmark of our pasts, and
a reminder of what we hoped would soon be ours again.</P>

<P>I looked in wonderment at this single artifact of a world we only
just remembered. It was like a message that washes up in a bottle
on a foreign shore. It reminded us of how far we were away from
home. Like castaways holding up a sacred text, peering at its
mystic inscription, we were too flabbergasted to know just what to
say. It was Christmas time, and Susanna, who hadn't received hardly
any presents, but desperately wanted some, ran to her room and
returned some minutes later with the cube all wrapped in rice paper
and tied with a tiny string. The bow was impossibly small and
dainty. We all laughed. She put the tiny present in the middle of
the table, and we all laughed a great deal more.</P>

<P>The next day, Susanna accompanied me on my usual rounds to barter
for food from my neighbors. Everything was harder than ever with
the coming of the end of the war. Susanna naturally brought along
her diminutive present, and showed it to each house frau as we went
along. When we reached the home of her best friend, Greta, Susanna
retrieved the tiny package from her pocket and gave it reverently
to her friend.</P> 

<P>When Greta opened it, she couldn't believe her eyes. "Oh Susanna,"
Gerta cried, "you shouldn't give this marvelous thing to me. It's
the most wonderful thing you own." Susanna, just looked at her
friend with bemusement. </P>

<P>"I know," she replied simply. 
</P>
<P>Greta was ecstatic to think that she owned such a wonder. In the
mid-day sunlight, it was as glistening and crystalline as the jet
airplane Cook-san had pointed out days before. It seemed like pure
magic to us, the narrow end of the wedge.</P>
<P>
That Christmas there were very few presents and a great deal more
gossip than usual, so everyone made the rounds to pass Season's
Greetings upon all of their acquaintances. Eduard's equal knowledge
of English and Japanese came in very handy at this time. He worked
closely with the United States Air Force and translated documents
and memos from civil and ex-military authorities. He began using
his engineering skills to help set up regional refrigeration units
to store perishable supplies both for the occupation army and for
the indigenous population that was very nearly on the brink of
starvation.</P>

<P>Several days after we had visited Greta, the same officer who
visited us, made a stop at her house. This time he bore chocolate
candy bars. These were a treasure almost beyond imagination. The
children held them in their hot hands without knowing what to do
with them.</P> 

<P>"Go ahead," the officer urged. "You can eat them. I have a whole
box of them here in the Jeep. Instantly, the children tore into
these magical gifts, caressing the delicious chocolate with their
avid little tongues, while all the adult eyes focused on the box in
the Jeep. Obviously the officer had no idea that he held a small
fortune in his easy grasp. On the Black Market, a family could live
for several months on the remaining contents of that box, but how
was the officer to be expected to understand that? He came to us
from a different world.</P>

<P>Greta was so amazed at his generosity that she ran into her house,
pulled a dining room chair up to the mantle where her mother had
stored the sugar cube, and retrieved it. Eagerly, she ran back out
into the yard, and got the soldier's attention. Kneeling down, he
saw what she proffered him, the most valuable thing she owned, a
cube of sugar. He smiled and took it from her gratefully. She
smiled and gave him a big chocolatety kiss on the cheek.</P>

<P>It's hard to say how soldiers feel about things. They are trained
to hold everything within themselves. He seemed somewhat choked up.
He walked directly to his Jeep and made a hurried departure. I
don't know what happened to the cube of sugar. Did he pop it in his
mouth? Maybe he threw it into the woods. It probably was a bit
soiled by now. I suppose it doesn't really matter.<P></P></P>
<P>
After a few months, we got word that the Air Force had arranged
with the Navy to take us back to San Francisco aboard an empty
cargo freighter. It was all painted military gray and looked as
dismal on the outside as it was austere on the inside, but we were
very happy to go aboard. </P>

<P>We had long farewell dinners with each of our friends. "Stay in
touch," they cried out as we departed. "We'll never forget you," we
cried back.</P>
