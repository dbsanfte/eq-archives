	<FONT FACE="Courier New" COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1">
	<BR><P align=justify>
 The table wasn't the problem.  My mother and I owned one of those
fold-up jobs with metal legs, but, from my earliest memories through my
seventh year, we frequently had no place to set it up.  The tabletop was
covered in dingy off-white vinyl.  At one end, the vinyl was torn, and, at
the other end, the vinyl bubbled.  I used to run my hand along the bubble
and imagine that the moving air was a trapped mouse, and if I could push
him all the way to the torn patch, he might escape and be free.
        <P align=justify>
My mother and I moved apartments every few months, and the table
came with us.  Sometimes we camped on curbs during the lengthy interims
between one apartment "not working out" and "something else opening up."
The table waited with us, folded, on the sidewalk next to the cardboard
boxes filled with old shoes, a cast iron skillet, my mother's books, a
small brown globe with the constellations of the zodiac printed on it, and
a wooden statue of a frog who wore spectacles and held a doctor's bag.  My
mother named him Henri Mancini.  Sometimes old Sicilian men walked past
us, peered into our boxes, and asked us if anything was for sale.  My
mother would answer, "Va' a farti friggere!" Get lost.  Then she would
tell me, "It's important that we keep whatever we can."
        <P align=justify>
When you are waiting for "something else to open up," you cannot
really do anything else.  You cannot go to school because something might
open up while you're gone, and then no one will be there to help your
mother carry things.  You cannot sleep for very long stretches of time
because someone might steal from you.  When you have to pee, you squat
behind the tallest electrical box you can find.  When you have to
defecate, you go to the funeral home at the corner of Hutton and Irving
and ask the lady at the lobby desk whether you can use the bathroom.  She
will usually say yes if there isn't a viewing happening. In the bathroom,
there is a mauve and white double sink where you can wash your face and
feet, and maybe even your hair if you are quick.
        <P align=justify>
If it is taking too long to find a new place to live, you can stay
awhile in the basement of the Baptist church, or in the building that used
to be a firehouse.  The Baptist church is better because they let women
have one room and men have another, and you can keep your things with you.
In the building that used to be a firehouse, you have to leave your
belongings in a closet with everyone else's belongings, and your cot might
be next to a man who whispers, "Come on, pretty girl, come on while your
mama's not looking."  At the Baptist church, you can also have a hot
open-faced turkey sandwich with a side of peas.  This is particularly
welcome because, since you are not going to school, you have probably been
thinking a lot about the hot lunches you are missing.
        <P align=justify>
Whenever my mother and I were situated in an apartment, we kept
the folding table set up in the living room. Again, the table was not the
problem.  My mother's chair was the problem.  This is where she sat and
cried and looked out the window and "waited for things to catch up to us."
Things like her checks and my school lunch vouchers.  Your body does not
like it when you are waiting for things to catch up.  First, you are
hungry all the time, then you are so used to being hungry that you forget.
Then you feel your eyes getting bigger, and there are dark spots in your
peripheral vision and a clicking noise in your throat.  Then you cannot
sleep on your side anymore because your kneebones bruise the insides of
your legs.  You bite the inside of your mouth and swallow the blood.  You
chew on your hair and pretend it's coconut.
        <P align=justify>
Later, the checks and vouchers would come and my mother and I
would sit across from each other at the table and eat scrambled eggs
drowned in Tobasco Sauce or fried bologna on white bread.  We would buy
Popeye brand cereal which came in plastic bags.  We kept all of our food,
even the cereal, in the refrigerator because we were too stingy to share
any of it with the roaches.  We would live this way for a few months.
Then, one night, a building superintendent would knock on the door, and my
mother would stand from her chair and cry and say, "I don't have it.  Come
back on Tuesday."  Then, on Tuesday, we would fold up the table and carry
it down to the curb where we we'd wait again for something else to open
up.<P align=justify>
        
From the time I was eight until the time I was twelve,  I lived
with my mother sometimes, and sometimes I lived with strangers.  The
strangers all owned wooden tables.  In one house, where there were lots of
kids, there was a cake dome filled regularly with brownies in the middle
of the table.  The other kids and I did not have to ask before taking a
brownie, but we were each "on our honor" not to take more than one a day.
I always took two because I was ungrateful and did not care about my
honor.
        <P align=justify>
I was reinstated in my mother's care when I was twelve and, again,
the table was not the problem.  Dwayne was the problem.  Dwayne had no
front teeth and a red mole the size of a dime on his chin, the kind of
mole you can't help wondering about, the kind of mole that might make you
want to say, "you should get that thing checked."  He ate dinner with us,
and things like chicken started appearing on the table.  But the chicken
was always red and cold near the bones because my mother had no patience
with things cooking.  I slept in the living room, and overheard my mother
and Dwayne laughing behind the closed door of her bedroom.  He called her
"Sexy Sue."  My mother's name is Lorna.
        <P align=justify>
I hated Dwayne because my mother had never bothered to cook
chicken, or to get out of her chair for me.  I hated him because he gave
her money, and that was something I couldn't do until I was fourteen. I
hated him because, when I watched him laugh, I imagined that my mother
could fall through the sinister hole in his mouth where his teeth once
were.  He laughed when my mother forgot what year it was.  He laughed when
she read aloud to him or when she recited poetry she knew by heart.  I
once told him that my mother was brilliant, and he laughed at that too.  I
wanted to hit him but I only said, "don't mess with me."  Later that
night, I heard him repeat what I'd said to my mother and ask, "What's
wrong with your kid?"  My mother replied, "Pre-pu-bescent angst."
        <P align=justify>
Dwayne did not know how to read my mother the way I did, so he
could not tell when she was going to have an episode.  If Dwayne had ever
bothered to know her, he would have noticed when her voice became someone
else's voice, or when her vocabulary dumbed down.  But he didn't notice my
mother's shifts except to laugh and say, "Hey Sexy Sue, your shoes don't
match."  So he believed her when she screamed, "Get out of my life, you
imbecile."  And he probably never knew that, from time to time over the
next three years, she would sit in the dark and cry out his name.  Across
from me at the table, she would sigh and call him, "the best of the
beaus."
        <P align=justify>
Fourteen is a powerful age when you have not had money your whole
life.  When you are ten or eleven, you and your friends start talking
about it at the cafeteria table, and impatience glows red under your skin
and you say that fourteen will never come.  While you are waiting, you try
to get a paper route and you throw yourself at every stranger pushing a
stroller, "You need a baby-sitter?  Yo, ma'am? You need a baby-sitter?"
And you don't get a paper route, and you don't get hired as a baby-sitter,
and you say that fourteen will never come, and then it comes anyway.  And
then you walk up and down every street in the city, and find out that
almost noplace will hire someone who's only fourteen.
        <P align=justify>
My first after-school job was in the kitchen of a nursing home.  I
scooped pureed turkey onto plates for minimum wage.  I washed dishes and
trays and mopped floors.  I had a yellow employee ID card which I
presented to the tellers at currency exchanges when I needed to cash my
paychecks.  Every week, I left half the cash on my mother's table when she
wasn't looking.  She would take the cash when I wasn't looking.  She
pretended that she didn't need my help, and that I wasn't offering it.  I
pretended that I wasn't trying to purchase her, purchase my place in her
life.
    <P align=justify>    
Later, we continued pretending.  After I'd grown and moved away,
during the years she wouldn't give me her street address because she
claimed to be unable to trust me, I sent money to her post office box.
Later, when she agreed to a visit, we sat across from each other at a
restaurant table, and she hunched over her cigarette and muttered and did
not look at me.  She told me that she never loved me, that I couldn't be
her daughter because she didn't "feel that way about me, but we could be
friends."  "We can't be friends!" I answered, "I'm your kid.  You can't
break up with me."  Still later, I met her at another restaurant table,
and she told me that she never expected me to turn out so "responsible and
put-together."
        <P align=justify>
Of all the lies my mother and I lived, "responsible and put-together," may
have been the most egregious.  It is easy to become two-dimensional when
you are forever playing Straight Man, when your only role is to set up the
punch lines, and you are not permitted to exercise any lunacies of your
own.  It is easy to confuse restraint with maturity. Then one day when you
are trying to ascertain how you feel about something- about anything- and
can't, you realize that you are not responsible and put-together; you are
pent-up.  You do your jobs, and you keep yourself neat, and you live in
your head and stay quiet.
         <P align=justify>
When you are pent-up, every once in a while madness seeps out
because you can't help it.  For me, one manifestation of madness was an
insatiable lust for furniture. I was twenty-two, pregnant with my son, and
striving for embourgeoisement.  Maybe I thought that bringing my infant
home to an apartment that looked middle-class would automatically make him
middle-class, the way, in 17th century England, you would buy yourself a
coat of arms so your sons could be born as gentlemen.
        <P align=justify>
I couldn't afford new furniture so I plagued my friend Michael who
managed a furniture resale shop.  I telephoned him every day- usually
twice. He did come through with furniture- a sofabed, a coffee table, a
rocking chair, a bedroom set.  He could not, however, find a dinette set
for me.  At five months pregnant, my worrisome lack of a dinette set
became too much to bear.  I ordered one from the JCPenney catalog.  I'd
never ordered furniture from a catalog before and did not realize that it
arrives unassembled.  This shouldn't have been a problem.  I am moderately
handy and have patience and a wide range of screwdrivers.  But I could not
put this table together.  "What's wrong with me?" I screamed at the allen
wrench, the bolts, and the acorn nuts.  "Why am I so stupid?!"
        <P align=justify>
I imagined that the unassembled table would remain in a heap of
sticks on the living room floor.  And now that I'd admitted defeat in one
area, the other areas of my life would certainly be doomed.  I would let
everything go now- lose my job, lose my sanity, begin spending my days
sitting in a windowside chair or dating toothless people who laughed too
much.  I imagined that my son, years later, would have to apologize to
whatever friends he brought home, "Yeah, that's our table- it's always
been like that.  My mom's a little loopy."  Eventually, he'd do what I'd
done as a child- he'd go out all the time because he wouldn't be able to
hear another of his friend's cautious whispers, "Is your mom sick?  What's
wrong with her?"
          <P align=justify>
I wrestled with the table for an entire weekend.  By the time I
finished it, my palms were raw, and I was getting Braxton-Hicks
contractions.  It never occurred to me that, now, five years later, my son
and I would never eat there, that we'd prefer spreading a blanket on the
floor to have "picnics."  By now,  I can leave something unfinished until
later.  By now, I can begin to understand my anxieties- the causal
trajectories of my childhood.  Yes, the table was not the problem, but
neither was homelessness, my mother's chair, Dwayne, or even money.  For
me, the principal problem was living in a state of constant uncertainty-
the frequent feeling of being unsafe or unwelcome.  That uncertainty,
displaced onto objects or people or into class-based rage, would not be
fixed by having furniture or food or a place to live.  It would only be
fixed by learning who I was until I could find security in it.  My
mother's principal problems were quite different from mine.  I needed to
learn that too.
