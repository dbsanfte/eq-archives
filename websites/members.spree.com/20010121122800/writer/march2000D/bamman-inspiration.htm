<P align=justify>
Oskar, me, sips his wine as she, looking the other way, searches for fresh garlic.  Already drunk, I silently but passionately toast to her health, to man's disobedience and gulp down the remaining half of my wine.  We listen to the music coming from the little, black radio in her kitchen next to the not-so-fresh garlic.  Oldies music.  Older than me, I think.  And definitely older than her.  She, Italian-looking. Raphael's Madonna Sistine.  Healthy, dark Italian hair. Beautiful Italian skin.  Beautiful Italian lover.  Although not Italian at all.  No, dear wife, I'll eat out tonight?  No friends.  So… all by myself.  I want to finish that short story I've been working on, you know.  I'll pick something up if I get hungry.  I'm sorry but as you know, I can only write when I get that feeling and I've got it now.
<P align=justify>	"Brandy?" She looks up, over at me.  Her name is not Brandy.  I stand.  And louder, "Such a fine girl."  She smiles and I sing even louder.
	<P align=justify>"What a good wife you would be."  It's too late.  "But my…"
<P align=justify>	"But Oskar, you already have a wife," she interrupts, still smiling.
<P align=justify>	"Yes, the sea.  The sea is my wife, my love and my lady."  No more smiling, no laughter, no singing.  The radio finishes the song we started together and we sit in silence.  My clumsy silence and her angry, frustrated silence.  Angry at me, frustrated because of me.
<P align=justify>	"Her name's Beatrice," she reminds me.  Yes, beautiful Beatrice, my beautiful, wonderful, almost-perfect wife.  A Nordic princess.  Natural class, fun, petite, witty.  My Swiss lover of Irish, German and English blood.
	<P align=justify>"Well then, the sea and Beatrice.  You see, I'm a polygamist but…" 
	<P align=justify>"No, you are a coward and an adulterer."  I almost completely fill my almost empty glass with more red wine.  "But you do have only one wife." 
<P align=justify>	"Let's rise above such labels. I mean, what's the differ…  I simply have too much love, like you, to give to just one person.  And you, Benedetta, have much more love than me to give."
<P align=justify>	"My name is Lisa.  And as I've said many times before, I really do not like it when you call me those stupid names of yours." Benedetta.  Elisabetta.  Francesca.  Desdemona.  All much better names for her, and in general.  "And let's remember that I'm not married," she says while embalming the pork and/or chicken in a delicate blend of garlic, rosemary, black pepper, et cetera.
<P align=justify>	"Excuse me."  Scusi, in Italian.
<P align=justify>	"I said that I'm not married."  Promiscuous yes, but never married.
	<P align=justify>"Si signorina.  But you couldn't be married."
<P align=justify>	"I admit that I'm not ready for marriage.  Do you?" 
<P align=justify>	"Bella donna!  Balli con Oskar."  She doesn't smile. I turn the volume up on the little, black radio.  In a thick, passionate, resounding voice, "Dance with me!  Drink with me!"  And much closer, "Let's get really drunk.  I mean, really drunk.  I want to make love to you outside under the full, indifferent moon."  A smile!  She doesn't want to argue.  We don't see each other to argue.
<P align=justify>	We dance a slow, close, romantic dance in her bright kitchen.  She, not I, occasionally stops to poke and prod and turn the aromatic, roasting beast and/or fowl in the oven.  And I gain experience for my short story.  Never a liar.
<P align=justify>	"Oskar?"  
	<P align=justify>"Yes, my love?"  My wife's in the parlor with a band of angry, moral denizens?  Her father will join us for dinner but not dessert?
<P align=justify>	"The pork is ready."  No foul for Oskar.
<P align=justify>"Si, oui.  Madame Jambon, I will get the wine."
<P align=justify>"Oh, I never made a side."
<P align=justify>"Then wine will be our side. Two bottles should
be enough."
	<P align=justify>"I can make a salad.  It'll only take a minute."
<P align=justify>	"I actually prefer wine as my side."  
<P align=justify>	She wants to be serious.  I grow old.  I grow old.  Life, mine at least, is already very serious.  I sing, talk, eat, drink and laugh.  She listens, I think, and doesn't laugh and only occasionally says more than "yes" or "no". Barely sipping her wine.  Barely eating her pig.  Barely making eye contact with me, the scourge of the earth.
<P align=justify>	Is this the end, my only friend?  Is she going to end our lovely affair?  I twist my wedding ring around.  My nervous habit.  Maybe this is what I need.  No.  It doesn't feel right.  She's so beautiful.  My Italian muse.  Jealous of my love for my mortal wife.
<P align=justify>	"Oskar?"  Her tone!  Such a grave, serious tone.  
<P align=justify>	"Yes, my love?"  
<P align=justify>	"We need to discuss a few things."  Human rights?  Existentialism?  Religious symbolism in Italian cooking?
<P align=justify>	"We'll talk later.  Life's too short to talk all the time.  We already talk too much.  And I'm… I'm a man of action.  Besides it's late and I need to get back to the sea soon."
<P align=justify>	"Oskar, I need to talk to you. Everything else can wait for now.  I had to see you tonight for a reason."  Gently, I take a sip of my wine, my faithful inspiration, my confidante, the blood of my…
<P align=justify>	"Yes, go on."  She's crying beautiful, non-Italian tears.  My maudlin beauty.  My Magdalene beauty.  Will we make love again?  
<P align=justify>	"I just…"  Wet face with stale tears.  "I saw my doctor today.  I mean, I had an appointment.  A check-up because I was concerned." <P align=justify>
"Everything's all right." Shit. Madonna con bambino!?!  Not possible.  Think.  I know she's been with others.  Think.  Even recently.  She rests her wet face on my soon-to-be wet shoulder.  Think.  Try to comfort her.  Is it working?  Of course not.  She's crying, again.  Think.  Sotto voce:  "We'll work everything out.  And I support your decision whatever it may be.  Remember…"  
<P align=justify>"Decision?"  She laughs and shakes her head.	"You're not going to be a father."  She waits and adds, "At least I'm not going to be a mother."
<P align=justify>	"I don't understand…"
	<P align=justify>"I know.  Just listen."  She hesitates again, breathes deeply and wipes her face with her napkin while I wait patiently with mine.  "I found out today that I have a serious problem…an illness. I have a real problem and I don't know what to do about it.  I hope that this does not concern you but I think it does. I don't know how or what to say…"  Please sing, Oh, earthly muse. 
<P align=justify>"Are you going to be all right?" I ask with direct, compassionate eye contact. 
<P align=justify>"I'm not going to die if that's what you mean."  Ill-fated woman discovers cure for death.  "And I will manage. You know that I've been through a lot.  This is just another sad part of my life."  She continues her sad story as I hold her tightly, very tightly, and kiss her surprisingly dry forehead.  Can't catch anything that way.  Relax.  She has it.  Not me.  My wife, clean and not too jealous.   I must get home to her.
<P align=justify>	"I want to stay longer but it's late, you know.  I'm sorry but I need to go home.  I really wish I could stay longer."
<P align=justify>	"I know."  I am always amazed at her understanding.
<P align=justify>	"I'll call you tomorrow."  I smile and she nods.  "We'll have lunch at the restaurant of your choice."  Another safe kiss on her dry forehead.  "Bye.  I'll call you tomorrow."
<P align=justify>	The outside air is cold and refreshing.  My familiar walk is much less than a mile.  I blow a warm cloud of air for my face to pass coldly through.  My childhood ineffective method of distracting my cold face on long, cold walks.  Now, my fate may be herpetically sealed?  No.  Maybe?  The mighty emperor, Hepatitis, be after me.  It's not curable, I think.  Not yet at least. More funding toward the cure of gonorrhea, down with syphilis!  We will be oppressed no longer!  That'll be my campaign slogan.  A vote for Oskar is a vote against all STD's.  I'll take it straight to the White House.  
<P align=justify>There is no good disease.  Brilliant, Oskar.  But a lot of great artists have been infected with this or that.  Herpes, such a silly name for a disease.  A good name for a dog though.  Herpes, the bastard daughter of Hermes and an Italian mortal.  En route to Hades, Hermes notices a young mortal collecting pomegranates outside of her bronze house.  She is the pure, innocent, easy Benedetta di Siena.  So, of course, he swoops down, frolics and excuses himself explaining that he has an extremely urgent message from Zeus to deliver to uh… uh… Mercury in Rome!  8.75 months later, ecco Herpes.  The mortal half stillborn.  The immortal half alive but wretched.  Herpes and its microscopic, hell-raising army are cursed to battle all mortals who passively or actively worship the venereal goddess in a half shell.
<P align=justify>	Westview Lane.  My street, or lane.  At least, I live on this lane.  Heading East, the view must be behind me.  The lights are on.  No miraculous intervention, no magic, no prayers answered for she is still awake and at home.  Virgil is not waiting as I had hoped.  The smell of wine and garlic and not of pork remain with me.  Nobody around.  "Herpes, here boy.  Good boy, goooood boy.  Sit.  Stay.  Just a little more ointment on your mange.  Now that's a good boy."  A vet's visit is needed soon.  I'll need an excuse.  To finish my short story.  To finish my novella!  Experience, first.  Write, later.  One last cold, refreshing breath.  Keys.  Enter Oskar, from the audience.
<P align=justify>	"Queen Bea?"
<P align=justify>	"In here!"  Where?  Not the bedroom.  Kitchen?  No.  Bathroom?
<P align=justify>	"Marco!"  
<P align=justify>	"Polo!"  The living room.  Nice, neutral and cozy.
<P align=justify>	"My beautiful Queen.  Your worker is home."  I kiss her on the head.  A silent confession of garlic and possibly wine.
<P align=justify>	"I see that Her Majesty's faithful servant has found garlic from another Queendom."
<P align=justify>	"Didn't you hear the news?"
<P align=justify>	"What news?"
<P align=justify>	"Well Miss Uninformed, the streets are full of the undead.  Vampire-like zombies who only attack, and kill, uninformed humanoids like yourself.  Garlic is simply the best and only defense."
<P align=justify>	"Vampires, eh?"
<P align=justify>	"Don't get your hopes up.  Not those Hollywood vampires.  But undead peasants who subsist on the blood, marrow and ideas of the living."
<P align=justify>	"Is this the idea of your short story in progress?"
<P align=justify>	"Novella, sweetie.  And you were the inspiration."
<P align=justify>	"Wonderful.  Did you happen to see any vampire peasants?"
	<P align=justify>"No, but I'm thinking about getting a dog."
<P align=justify>	"He'd be your responsibility."
<P align=justify>	"I know.  I'll name her, not him, Nosferatu."
<P align=justify>	"Well the living also need to eat and this living, uninformed Queen is still hungry.  I waited for you."
<P align=justify>	"I told you not to."
<P align=justify>	"I know but…"
<P align=justify>	"No excuses.  But… since I'm sure you only had good intentions, I'll cook for you.  How about a delicious Swiss dish?"
<P align=justify>	"What?  Spaghetti isn't Swiss."
<P align=justify>	"Nein, no spaghetti.  No Italian."
<P align=justify>	"Meatballs?"
<P align=justify>	"Nein! Beer and sauerkraut."
	<P align=justify>"My absolute favorite.  But we have neither, nor the makings for them."
<P align=justify>	"I'll order you a pizza then."
<P align=justify>	"That's Italian."
<P align=justify>	"All right then I'll order you a Sino-Swiss dish from Heidi's House of Hunan.  I think Chicken with garlic sauce is their specialty."
<P align=justify>	"That sounds good. And I'll be safe from the undead peasants."
<P align=justify>	"I'll pick up the food."
<P align=justify>	"Have them deliver.  I want you home for a change."  
I place the order from our clean, dim kitchen.  A half empty, half full bottle of wine strategically placed by the phone to remind me that she is lonely and, as all lonely people do in this household, drinks red wine by herself.  
<P align=justify>	"Your food will be here soon.  I don't feel well.  Too much coffee or writing or something.  I'm going to take a bath to relax," I shout to her, now reading.  She consents.
<P align=justify>	I lock the door behind me, run the water in the bathtub and remove my clothes to give myself the long-awaited self-examination.  Nothing.  And again, nothing.  Unfaithful, lucky, married scourge of the earth unlocks the door and escapes into the hot water.  Closes eyes, relaxes.  The phone rings.  Two rings.  She talks and is still talking. Perhaps the delivery man won't deliver because of the peasants?  Living and undead.  Or my diseased, promiscuous ex-lover is confessing my sins to relieve herself of her enormous guilt?
<P align=justify>	A soft knock on the door and Beatrice softly enters.
<P align=justify>	"So what brings the Queen to my humble but humid sanctuary?"  She looks upset and doesn't answer.  "You're always welcome to join me."  Bad news?  "If you want to, that is."  An accident?  Somebody's dead?  Please not your father! "What's going on?  Is everything all right?  Please talk to me."  Does she know?  "Who was on the phone?  Talk to me, Beatrice."
<P align=justify>	"It doesn't matter."		
<P align=justify>	"What doesn't?"
<P align=justify>	"It doesn't matter who was on the phone."
<P align=justify>	"That's fine.  But please talk to me."
<P align=justify>	"Give me a moment."  
<P align=justify>	"Beatrice, you can talk to me about anything.  I'm a little concerned because I don't know what…"
<P align=justify>	"Just listen."
<P align=justify>	"I am.  Go on."
<P align=justify>	"Just let me finish.  Let me talk."  More than anything I want her to talk but she hesitates.  She must know.  Somehow she does.  A secret caller.  A private detective originally hired by her father to confirm everyone's suspicions that I am not talented, not smart, not a writer. I can no longer justify my lifestyle in saying that I am an artist because I'm not.  
<P align=justify>I remain silent, confused, warm, naked and wet.  "I love you, Oskar."  And will love me until the end, I hope.  "It's just that this is so hard for me to say."  She's not crying yet.  "I feel as if you probably know part of what I have to say."  Silence.  Stay focused.  Don't give anything more away.  Everything will be worked out.  I can't lose her.  Her voice!  She is nervous.  I deserve this.
<P align=justify>	"Listen sweetie."
<P align=justify>	"Please!  Oskar, let me talk."  No eye contact.
	<P align=justify>"I'm having an affair and I think you already know.  You must know."  I didn't.
<P align=justify>	"Yes," I lie.  My face becomes numb.  My stomach caves in.  The rest of me disappears into my white porcelain frame.  My wife, beautiful and married and not pure.  No, not pure.  I am silent.  She talks and rambles but it doesn't matter.  With whom?  She owes me that much.  No, it doesn't matter either.  Can we remain together?  I am no better.  Maybe worse.  
<P align=justify>	"What?" I ask her. 
<P align=justify>	"I said you must see a doctor."  She's crying.  Still no eye contact.  The doorbell rings.
<P align=justify>	"Why would I have to see a doctor?"
<P align=justify>	"This is so difficult, Oskar," she mumbles under tears.  "I'm really sorry."  Charmed by the charismatic, unnamed, faceless dictator known for his use in chemical warfare, Switzerland has given up her neutral status and has become an axis power.  Life is different but not over.  Life is very different.  The doorbell rings again.  I submerge myself in the hot water and watch my wife's image become distorted.
