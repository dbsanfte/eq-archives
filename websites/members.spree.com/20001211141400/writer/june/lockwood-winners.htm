	<P>"She's a winner!" He's a real loser". We frequently hear 
people labeled as winners or losers. We seem to instinctively 
know the difference.</P>

<P>Many years ago, I saved a poem that discusses the difference
between winners and losers. I don't know who wrote it, but 
I'll tip my hat to her or him, because the poem captured the 
essence of character that distinguishes winners from losers. 
I'll share it with you now with my thoughts.</P>

<P><STRONG>BE A WINNER!</STRONG></P>
<P>
Right here in the title is an acknowledgment of what most 
people want. To be a winner. To feel like a winner. With all 
the talk of win- win thinking, we still want to be a winner 
and to enjoy the positive emotions that accompany being a 
winner.</P>

<LI>Winners make commitments</LI>
<LI>
Losers make promises</LI>
<P>
While some people do treat their promises as commitments, 
many make empty promises knowing that they may not actually 
perform. The meaning of this stanza is clear; When winners 
make a commitment, they see it through to completion. You can 
count on a winner to come through.</P>

<LI>Winners go through a problem</LI>

<LI>Losers go around it, never get past it</LI>
<P>
This little-known secret of winners is powerful. When 
encountering a problem, don't just work around it this one 
time. Why not over- respond? Solve the problem then keep 
going to solve the source of the problem. Fix it for good, 
not just for now.</P>

<LI>Winners say, "Let's find out"</LI>

<LI>Losers say, "Nobody knows"</LI>
<P>
An insatiable curiosity allows winners to explore the source 
of opportunities as well as the source of problems. This 
makes it more likely that the winner will develop even more 
opportunities while solving the source of recurring problems.</P>

<P>It also turns out that genuine curiosity about other people 
is one of the secrets to increasing sales, improving customer 
service and strengthening relationships.</P>

<LI>Winners always have a plan</LI>

<LI>Losers always have an excuse</LI>

<P>Have you noticed that successful people seem to know where
they're going and what they want? It's no coincidence that 
winners have a plan. The process of thinking through the 
issue of what's important, allows the winners to keep a 
clear vision of the future and outline a path to get there. 
They routinely examine their mission by asking "where am I 
going with this", and "how will I accomplish my goals?"</P>
<LI>
Winners say "There's a better way"</LI>

<LI>Losers say, "It's the way it's always been done"</LI>

<P>Continuous improvement is one of the hallmarks of successful
people. Their motto is "If it's worth doing, it's worth doing 
better". Losers just keep on doing the same old things yet 
they expect different results.</P>

<LI>Winners are always involved in the answer</LI>

<LI>Losers are always part of the problem</LI>

<P>Winners are not whiners. Instead of complaining about a 
problem (or just sitting there being part of the problem), 
winners jump in looking for a solution. No blame, no pointing 
fingers, no belly- aching. Just fix it and move on.</P>

<LI>Winners know there is still much to learn</LI>

<LI>Losers want to be considered an expert before knowing how
little is known</LI>

<P>We've all encountered people who want to be "the expert", 
even though their expertise is out-of-date, incomplete, or 
overestimated. You won't find them in classes, in the library 
or in deep debate. Winners understand that knowledge has a 
short shelf-life. Winners also appreciate that, to be 
valuable  to clients, they must constantly explore the limits 
of their knowledge.</P>

<LI>Winners learn from their mistakes</LI>
<LI>
Losers learn only not to make mistakes by not trying 
anything different</LI>

<P>Winners are opportunistic about learning from daily 
experiences. All of us have hundreds of experiences each day 
that could be valuable learning opportunities. Losers ignore 
them and surf the shallow surface of their knowledge. Winners 
understand that learning in today's fast-paced and ever-
changing environment can't be left to chance. Successful 
people make a conscious effort to actively seek new ideas, 
innovation and growth.</P>
<P>
There you have it. Is this the complete list of the 
characteristics of successful people? Surely not. There are 
as many types of winners as there are winners. To me, the 
poem addresses the fundamental qualities of being a winner. 
It captures the spirit of open-mindness, strength and 
compassion that makes winners and winning attractive.</P>

<P><STRONG>Be a winner!</STRONG></P>
