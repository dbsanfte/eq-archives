<P>	The stick looked innocent enough. So did those purplish
                                lines - straight up and down, but ragged around the
                                edges, which pretty well describes how I feel these
                                days. I've got my feet on the ground, and my shoulders
                       are square, but my mind isn't always focused. </P>

                     <p>  It was around 4 am, just me and my EPT. I was thrilled with the
                       positive results (we have been "trying"), but the prospect of my first
                       early-morning work session without caffeine prevented me from
                       showing it. I shuffled into the kitchen where, instead of brewing a
                       pot of coffee, which I usually slug myself before the rest of the
                       family wakes, I poured a glass of ice water. I'm pretty sure I dozed
                       off just waiting for the computer to boot up. Later that day, I had to
                       pull over on the side of the road to take a nap. It was two in the
                       afternoon.</P> 

                      <P> I can no longer rely on my mid-morning adrenaline surge, either. I'm
                       not running anymore. (Turns out, my obstetrician prefers his
                       pregnant patients to take long walks - not long jogs - at 10,800 feet
                       elevation.) </P>

                 <P>      So, instead of relying on my usual energy boosts, I have had to take
                       my own Momscape advice and focus on taking better care of
                       myself. In my case, that means getting more sleep.</P> 

                  <P>     Now, instead of relying on a 4 am alarm, I wake to my daughter
                       cooing "Mommy" from her bed. When it's naptime, we tuck in
                       together to read stories, and she often outlasts me. More than once
                       have I awoken to her lying across my chest, flipping through the
                       storybook I had drifted off while reading.</P> 

                       <P>As I've focused on getting more sleep, my body has begun to tell me
                       what it needs. More water, 15 minutes with my feet up, a night out -
                       all by myself. </P>

                   <P>    I once worked for a doctor who would marvel at how we will focus
                       on caring for ourselves when it has a direct effect on our child's
                       health (during pregnancy and breastfeeding). The rest of the time,
                       we rush through life shifting from a caffeine buzz to an adrenaline
                       high and back again.</P> 

                     <P>  But when we take care of ourselves, we are better able to take
                       care of everyone else. And so, as I put my growing family first, I
                       will do my best to keep up. If you notice an occasional late
                       newsletter delivery, a delay in a reply to your email, or a slight
                       change in our format from time to time, please know things here
                       couldn't be better. Chances are, I'm just taking it easy with my
                       babies. </P>

                     <P>  This week, spend some time discovering what gets in the way of
                       tuning in to your physical, emotional, and spiritual needs. How could
                       you make your own life better? Maybe it's adopting a more active
                       lifestyle, making better nutrition choices, seeking out more positive
                       friendships, or improving your ability to say "no". This week, sit still
                       for a moment and let your body tell you.</P>
