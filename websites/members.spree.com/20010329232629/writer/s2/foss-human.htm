	<P>The end of the century is a momentous event. The end of a millennium is even more momentous, hence asking for celebration, review of hitherto accomplished tasks and plans made for the future.  
Somehow there was, and perhaps still is, something magic about the year 2000. All of a sudden this year because of its new date format became more important than any previous one...and imposed on us, the society, the urge to do something extraordinary, something that will be remembered over centuries...
</P>
<P>So what did we come up with? 
</P>
<P>The Millennium Dome - a massive recreation for the masses that was supposed to attract millions of visitors each month, pay for itself and earn money. However, the Dome project came to grief...not only did it not pay for itself, but because of too few visitors  it needed more cash injections to keep it going...so it received money more than three times, and more than twice, the money came from the lottery funds. 
There would not have been anything peculiar about it, but knowing that children's hospice was refused money by the same lottery fund board makes you really sick. Obviously it is more important to pump money into another fun centre than to help children...
</P>
<P>Before the decision about such a huge undertaking like building the Dome was taken, would it not be wiser to think twice and make a list of priorities. What does the country need most?
</P>
<P>The list of cancer patients, both children and adults, people waiting for transplants, elderly people requiring proper nursing is endless. The needs are big and the money spent on the health service is not enough. At the same time huge amount of money is wasted, spent on another amusement...
</P>
<P>Why did Dome, and the Millennium Wheel have to be built? Could we not mark the end of the Millennium by creating something useful, something that would help those, who are in desperate need?
It seems to me, that the board of directors responsible for the Dome project forgets that  society does not consist only of healthy and well off people that have nothing better to do than to spend time having fun. 
Each pound that has been mindlessly spent on the Dome could have saved somebody's life or accelerate the recovery process...However, when big money is concerned and big fish are involved, one knows that there is no chance of society being asked about its needs in a referendum.
A new, well equipped hospital or a new hospice does not sound as good as the Dome, "the attraction" for the beginning of the new Millennium. Nor does it look as splendid as the Dome...and it is all that matters. The Dome is yet another  "Monument of Human Vanity". If it were the monument to really mark the new millennium, it would not have to ask for all the publicity. 
</P>
<p>A new hospital is too ordinary to be taken into account...
<BR>
As the lottery board refused to donate money to a children's hospice, we will donate 10% of our commission on the next domain we sell (for up to USD 2500.00) from:
 http://www.interzaden.com/domainsale.html to the cause that the lottery forgot.
It is not a lot, but then we do not have access to millions of pounds.
