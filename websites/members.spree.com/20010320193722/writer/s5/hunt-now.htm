<br><br><FONT FACE="Franklin Gothic Book" COLOR="#000062" SIZE="+1">
<P>Sometimes I look back at my life and think, what have I achieved? The
reality is I've achieved a hell of a lot. I guess we are all so busy
plodding through from day to day we don't see where we've come from and what
we have done.
</P>
<P>I'm really grateful of my life experiences- good and not so good. You're
probably thinking 'why the not so good' right, well I look at it as lessons
it's how we learn by these experiences that really matter. I've searched for
the perfect job, the perfect work conditions, good money, bosses who
appreciate you and are reasonable when it comes to family needs and so on.
</P>
<P>I have come close to having all this but never in the one job, it took me a
lot of years to realise I wasn't going to find it and at the same time what
I wanted deep down was to be my own boss. I wanted to create my own destiny.
</P>
<P>I realised at my age I will never become wealthy enough and have the
lifestyle that I want working for someone else.</P>

<P>Having said this some people are happy to be employees and do get job
satisfaction and conditions they are happy with. Some people do this and run
part time businesses from home. Just a point to remember while working for
someone else you will always be exchanging your time for money. If you build
your own business to a point whereby money will work for you, you can spend
your time doing the things you love to do.</P>

<P>Some other factors of course are the taxes we pay, as employees the system
will never allow us to get ahead; there are not many tax advantages in being
an employee. Maybe we baby boomers might have had a chance of financial
freedom it the education system taught money management as part of their
curriculum at school.</P>

<P>You see, at school (and home) you are taught to get a good education to get
a good job that will give you the lifestyle. For the majority of people this
doesn't happen, what ends up happening is we get an education to get a job
(maybe), eventually get married have a family and end up in the 'rat race'.
</P>
<P>As the family grows so does the debt and so on and so on until we find
ourselves in a situation of working because we have to keep up with our
debts, not because we want to or because it's enjoyable. How many people do
you know who love getting up for work every morning?</P>

<P>I knew I had to look at my future from a different perspective. I had to
create my future myself and the only way I could do this was firstly to
really think about and write down my dreams and goals and then look at how I
could achieve them. I had to stop thinking in a way that I had been
conditioned and that wasn't easy I can tell you. It's so easy to fall back
into old habits and ways of thinking without even knowing you're doing it so
my first task was to be conscious of when I was doing this.</P>

<P>How I do this is to have my dreams and goals visible and my plan of action
of how to achieve my dreams and goals and then take ACTION yes that's right
you have to take ACTION, or it won't happen.</P>

<P>So many people I know have dreams and goals they don't do anything about, it
stays in their head, they never take ACTION. They fall into the trap of
blaming, blaming other people, circumstances, situations and so on for them
not fulfilling their dreams and goals while this can be partly true, if you
really want your dreams and goals to come to fruition you will overcome
these barriers no matter what. If you have the drive you'll do it.</P>

<P>That's what I'm doing now I'm taking ACTION and it's working- don't worry I
still have my days where I think ' I can't do this anymore it's too hard. I
don't give myself a hard time about feeling this way I just take some time
out then go back to my goals, look at my children and think- 'right, now I
know why I'm doing this'.</P>

<P>I guess no one knows what the future holds for them but I certainly believe
you can plan and create your future the best you can - of course that's if
you know what you want!</P>
