<BR><BR><FONT FACE="Century Gothic" COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1"><b>
         
<P>All online research will involve you finding resources you
need and then bookmarking them in your browser, so you don't
have to search for them again! Inevitably many of your
resources will be websites, some of which are dedicated to
your chosen field.</P>
<P>
In a previous article http://www.getpub.com/report19.htm
I discussed how you can find sites of interest for your
research. Once you have located them the next step is to
monitor them on a regular basis so that you are kept up to
date with any changes the webmaster for the site may make.
These updates could provide you with more valuable
information.</P>

<P>That's fine, I hear you say, but how do I do it?</P>

<P>Well you could do it the hard way and visit each site on a
daily or weekly basis just in case something has changed.
Obviously this method is very time consuming and I am sure
you have better things to do with your valuable writing
time!</P>

<P>An easier way would be to receive an email from a site when
it has changed. Some webmasters provide this capability from
their website by providing a box where you can put your
email address. You will then be emailed by the webmaster
when a change has been made. Some webmasters are more
reliable than others at informing their visitors of changes,
and not all webmasters provide this functionality at their
sites.</P>

<P>There are other ways. Use intelligent software bot's.</P>

<P>What? You do not know what a bot is? Let me tell you.</P>

<P>The word "bot" is short for "robot" which implies that they
are able to do something for you at your command. This
really is the essence of what they do.</P>

<P>Bot's, or intelligent agents, as they are also known, can
help you with all sorts of mundane online tasks. There are
bot's that will scour online news sites looking for news
about your specialist topic and when they find some they
send it to your email address! Other bot's are able to help
you surf the Net more intelligently and will even suggest
sites that may be of interest to you!</P>

<P>The bot's we are interested in are those that can monitor
websites and email us when either a website changes or a new
website covering our subject area appears on the Net!</P>

<P>Wow! That can save us an immense amount of time.</P>

<P>Well the good news is that it is very easy to find these
bot's and to use them. You do not have to be a technological
wizz kid to get these beauties going!</P>

<P>First of all you need to find them and learn all about their
capabilities before deciding on which bot to use. To do this
you must visit http://www.botspot.com which is the
definitive place for locating any type of bot on the Net.</P>

<P>This site has a lot of information about bot's including
what they can do for you and, more importantly, where you
can find them.</P>

<P>The bot's we are interested in here, and the ones I use most
extensively, are the web surfing bots. I use two, "The
Informant" and the "NET-HAPPENINGS" bot.</P>

<FONT FACE="Century Gothic" COLOR="#007F00" SIZE="+1">USING THE INFORMANT</FONT>

<P>The Informant is an agent that will use the search engines
to find websites that cover your chosen topic. It will then
email you with details of the number of new websites it has
found together with other websites that have been updated
since you last visited them.</P>

<P>This information is invaluable because it avoids you having
to search the Net manually.</P>

<P>To use the Informant go to http://informant.dartmouth.edu
and sign-up, it is FREE! You will then be asked to specify
the keywords that describe the topic you are interested in.
You can also specify particular website addresses (URL's)
that you want monitored.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Century Gothic" COLOR="#007F00" SIZE="+1">USING NET-HAPPENINGS</FONT></P>

<P>NET-HAPPENINGS is an email announcement list of new
websites. When new sites come online this agent emails you.</P>

<P>To sign up go to
http://scout18.cs.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/lwgate/NET-HAPPENINGS/

and leave your email address. You cannot target specific
topics with this list, so you may have to filter out a lot
of irrelevant sites, but it is still worth signing up for.</P>

<P>While you're there it is also worth signing up for the Ezine
notification list as well. This list will email you when new
Ezines are registered with them.</P>

<P>To sign up go to
http://scout18.cs.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/lwgate/NEWSLTR/ </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Century Gothic" COLOR="#007F00" SIZE="+1">SUMMARY</FONT></P>

<P>It is important to be informed of the latest online
developments in your subject area. What I have covered in
this article are ways in which you can use software bot's to
make this job easier.
</P>
<P>I hope this helps you. Thanks for reading.</P>
