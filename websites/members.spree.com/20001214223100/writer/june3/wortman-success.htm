 <P>Have you ever wondered...</P>

<P>Why are some people more successful than others?</P> 
<P>
Why do some people make more money, have more friends, enjoy better
health and get greater satisfaction from life than others do?</P>

<P>All Successful people have certain traits and habits in common.
Use them in your life to access your personal power and realize
your 
full potential as human beings. Our goal is to empower you to
control 
your thinking, attitude and outlook while providing you the steps 
needed to ahieve your goals. Use these proven methods to get what 
YOU want and bring about dramatic improvements in your life.</P>

<P>What is success?</P>

<P>There are basically six requirements for success.</P>

<P>1) Peace of mind. Without peace of mind nothing else has very much 
flavor. Peace of mind means freedom from fear, freedom from anger
and freedom from guilt. Going to sleep at night completely in
harmony
with ourselves and waking up the same way.</P>

<P>2) High levels of health and energy.  No matter what we have in our
life, if we don't have our health or we do not have the energy to
enjoy
our life we do not get much satisfaction from it. </P>

<P>3) Loving relationships.  The ability to enter into and maintain
long-term
intimate, mature relationships with other people.</P>

<P>4) Financial freedom.  It means that we have enough money so that
we
don't worry about money. The amount will vary from person to
person,
when you are not preoccupied with where the money to pay your bills
is 
going to come from. We can't enjoy life if we're preoccupied with
money.</P>

<P>5) Worthy goals and ideals. As human beings we are not capable of
functioning at our best unless we have clear goals that we are 
committed to and worthy ideals to believe in. Our need for meaning
and 
purpose is the greatest single drive in human nature.</P>

<P>6) A feeling of personal fullfillment. The feeling that we are
becoming
everything we are capable of as human beings, fullfilling our full
potential in life. </P>

<P>We all measure our success relative to our ability to enjoy more of
these
six ingredients of a well rounded life.</P>

<P>So, why is it that so few people can be described as successful?
A full 95% of all people reaching retirement age in our society
today
end up flat broke and dependent on others for survival. Only 5% or
less
acheive financial independence in their lifetimes.</P>

<P>There are precise steps that all successful people use, consciously
or
unconsciously, everyday to gain all six ingredients to success in
their
lives. Once you learn to use these methods everyday in your own
life
you will see your dreams and wishes turning into reality. </P>

<P>Ask yourself this question,

"If I could do one thing in my life knowing that I was guaranteed
to
succeed, what would it be?"</P>

<P>Know that whatever it is, you CAN do it!</P>

<P>Think about this question seriously. It will help you to focus on
what it
is you really want to do with your life.</P>
