<P align=justify>
Before dusk, we had the house as secure and ready for him as we could.  Periodically, I'd checked the phone, but it was still dead.  If Sheed was going to do anything, he'd do it tonight in the storm.

<BR><BR><HR><BR><BR>
<P align=justify>
It was midnight, and we had been in the closet just before it got dark.  Ann finally fell asleep, but I couldn't.  The darkness of the house had grown oppressive as it closed around us in our small confines.  It was almost viscous as it covered us like a black velvet robe obscuring our vision.
<P align=justify>
Only the moan of the wind through the trees outside could be heard.  Then a tiny squeak snapped my attention back to reality.  It could have easily gone unheard if I hadn't been in a state of heightened anticipation.  I sensed an unseen presence entering the claustrophobic blackness, and it caused my stomach to turn into a writhing ball of snakes.
<P align=justify>
I nudged Ann.  While I couldn't see her in the blackness, I knew she was awake because she leaned to my ear and asked, "What?"  I put my finger across her lips.  I knew that both of us now were listening and searching for sounds from below.  What we heard was no louder than the moon going behind the clouds, but something was downstairs.
<P align=justify>
The snap of the trap startled us.  As we huddled in the master bedroom closet listening for a scream, we heard something thrown into the living room.  "Was that the trap?  Why isn't he screaming?  Didn't he step on it?" Ann asked.
<P align=justify>
"Maybe it was too obvious.  We still have the one upstairs and our trip wire on the steps."
<P align=justify>
We heard him prowling around the house.  The floorboards squeaked and snapped as he walked across them.  He was no longer trying to be quiet.  There were only a few throw rugs downstairs to muffle his footsteps, so we heard him move through the front hall into the dining room towards the kitchen.  We heard him cross the kitchen and slide open the pocket door between it and the laundry room.  Slowly he worked his way to the hall that led to the family room.  From the family room, he went into the living room; and from there, back towards the front of the house.
<P align=justify>
Then he was back in the front hall, but it wasn't until we heard one of the steps creak that we knew he was coming up.  "He's bound to step on the fishing line and trip the ax or stick his foot in the trap in the upstairs hall," I whispered.  Again, silence.
<P align=justify>
Then the rattle of the master bedroom door knob startled us.  We had closed and locked all the doors upstairs so he would have to break them open to get in.  We hoped that while he was trying to break-in one of the doors, we might get the jump on him.
<P align=justify>
He didn't force the door.  He moved down the hall and tried each of the four other doors by jiggling the knob slightly.  Then we heard him kicking in a door.  Our door's have solid wood cores.  Therefore, he couldn't just put his foot through them.  He had to break the jam and force the door open if he wanted to get into a room.
<P align=justify>
We heard wood splinter and a door bang open.  We heard him enter a room, slide the closet door open, leave and move down the hall towards us kicking in doors as he went.  He was working his way back towards our bedroom at the head of the stairs.
<P align=justify>
His unrelenting methodical search produced an air of expectancy and heightened our fear.  I groped in the dark for the chain saw and knew that Ann had the cleaver.
<P align=justify>
We heard him rattle the guest bedroom door, and we made certain that the plasterboard cutout in the back wall of the closet was in place.  Then we moved into the master bedroom and got ready to open its door when he started to kick through the guest bedroom door.
<P align=justify>
But for some reason, he didn't break in the door.  He began to try the master bedroom door.  Quickly, we moved back into the guest bedroom.  Instead of breaking into the master bedroom, however, he suddenly smashed open the guest bedroom door knocking Ann down.
<P align=justify>
His flashlight blinded me.  I yanked at the chain saw starter cord, but now it wouldn't start.  He rushed me, but Ann managed to trip him.  As he fell, something clattered to the floor in front of me.  My night vision was gone.  I couldn't really see anything well.  I just kept trying to get the chain saw started as I pulled and pulled on the damn cord.  The motor sputtered and I began to smell gas.  Shit!  It was flooded.
<P align=justify>
I saw him swing the light and strike Ann.  As I heard her fall, I threw the chain saw at him.  "You Sonofabitch!" he yelled.
<P align=justify>
It gave me the chance I needed.  I lurched towards him and knocked him over on the floor with me on top of him.  He hit at me with the flashlight.  We rolled around in the room.  My hip sent searing waves of pain to my brain; but I wouldn't let go.  If I could get him into the hall, maybe I could push him into the trap.  I got lucky with a punch.  I tagged him right on the chin.  His grip loosened, and I squirmed away and into the hall.
<P align=justify>
I knew where the trap was.  It was to the right near the top of the stairs.  I had to stay to the left and close to the wall to keep from stepping on it myself.  If I could get him to chase me, he might step in it.  I moved towards the stairs and grabbed the handrail waiting for him to come after me.  The pain in my hip was intense, and I battled waves of nausea as I stood there waiting for him to come out of the room.
<P align=justify>
He didn't come.  I saw the flashlight beam swing around, heard him take a few steps, and grunt.  He came out of the room with his arm around Ann and holding the flashlight.  In the other, he had a gun. "Nothing to say?  The great horror story writer is wordless?  My, my.  What a shame," and he took a step closer to me.  "Go down the steps," he commanded.
<P align=justify>
I held my ground.  One more step closer and I'd chance another lunge at him.  He didn't move any closer.  Instead he pulled the trigger.  The deafening roar of the gun almost caused me to lose my balance as the bullet whistled past my head and hit the stair wall behind me.  "Get down the steps now or I'll shoot your wife!"
<P align=justify>
I carefully moved down the steps holding on to the handrail.  He didn't seem to notice me skipping over a step more than half way down.  I could tell Ann was trying to figure out just where she was in the hall.  When I was most of the way down the steps, he began to push her forward as they moved to the head of the stairs.
<P align=justify>
Suddenly, Ann took a big step forward and pulled him with her.  Snap!  His foot went into the steel leg trap.  He screamed and began to fall as Ann leapt forward and jumped down the stairs, skipping steps as she went.  We both ran the rest of the way down.  He hit the floor and thrashed around for a few seconds.  Then we heard the trap squeak as he pried it open to free his foot.  He hurled it down the stairs at us.
<P align=justify>
"You Bitch," he screamed as he staggered at the top of the stairs and illuminated us at the foot.
<P align=justify>
He had us.  He grabbed the stair rail and started to stagger down the steps keeping his gun pointed at us all the way.  He couldn't hold the flashlight and hold onto the handrail at the same time.  The light almost slipped from his grasp several times.  He stopped part way down to adjust his grip on the light.  He was almost at the trip line.  Just two more steps and he'd hit it.  All the while a constant stream of invectives flowed from his mouth.
<P align=justify>
He hobbled down one more step.  "Run," I said.  Ann went left and I staggered right and Sheed came in pursuit tripping on the steps as he swung his gun in Ann's direction.  The ax fell but swung past his head because he tripped and grabbed the handrail to catch himself. He straightened up and looked bewildered.  The back of the ax head struck him right in the face knocking him over backwards.  He slid down the remaining steps holding his head.  The pistol and flashlight tumbled down and landed on the floor at my feet.
<P align=justify>
The phone rang.  Ann and I shared a startled glance before she raced to the kitchen to find it.  I heard her knocking over furniture, pots and pans before her breathless, "Hello?"
<P align=justify>
"Thank God!  This is Ann Small.  Call the Sheriff and get him to come out here right away.  We caught a man trying to kill us.  Hurry!"
<P align=justify>
I'd found the gun and had it and the flashlight pointed at Sheed who was bleeding profusely from both the nose and the mouth.  "Who was that?"
<P align=justify>
"It was a telephone lineman checking our phone.  The storm knocked down some wires.  When I told him we caught someone trying to kill us he said he'd call the Sheriff right away."
<P align=justify>
The phone rang as she spoke.  From Ann's conversation, I knew that it was the Sheriff and he was on his way.  Ann's voice faltered a second when she asked, "Is he alright?  Oh, Dear God!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!  Oh, thank you!"  She hung up.
<P align=justify>
"What?  What did he say?"
<P align=justify>
"Rusty was found last night by someone plowing the roads.  He's alive, but the Sheriff says he'll be at the vets for a week or so because he's suffering from exposure and someone cut off most of his tail.  The Sheriff says he'll live."
<P align=justify>
"When is the Sheriff going to get here?"
<P align=justify>
"In about an hour.  Can we wait that long?"
<P align=justify>
"We'll make it.  Like Sheed told you on the phone, he liked the way I put my heroes in seemingly impossible situations but gave them a way out if they were clever enough.  Sheed just didn't realize how clever a frightened guy can be when he's trapped."
