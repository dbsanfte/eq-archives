	<P>Exercise...the dreaded word. At what stage in our lives do we decide 
that physical activity is a chore and not fun?</P>

<P>Think about children. They exercise constantly, most even on a daily 
basis, yet you don't see them doing too many activities they don't 
enjoy. So why as adults do we think we must join a gym or watch a 
boring exercise video to exercise? There are many forms of exercise.
Swimming, tennis, jumping rope, light jogging, bike riding,  brisk 
walking, weight lifting, mini-trampolines, rowing  machines, along 
with dozens of types of exercise equipment. So why limit your options?
</P>
<P>If you were to ask a child why they were out running around outside 
enjoying themselves, they would probably look at you funny and then 
say "I don't know...it's fun!" So why shouldn't adults have the same 
luxury of going outside and having fun?</P>

<P>No time you say?  Tired from work? Kids? Favorite program going to be 
on television? What messages have you been sending yourself so that 
you decide not to exercise?</P>

<P>When was the last time you saw a kid come in from the outside all 
huffy and puffy, cheeks glowing red from playing outside, and in a 
bad mood because they haven't yet got their homework done? Doesn't 
the homework always end up getting done before bed anyway?</P>

<P>Just last week I had arranged to go to the beach and climb 
(crawl :o) ) the sand dunes with a friend. Throughout the day I found 
myself thinking that I did not have enough time. I was too tired to 
exercise, besides I always take the stairs at work and that takes a 
lot of energy. I had a major assignment due that had to get done that 
night. I kept thinking that I should call my friend and say "let's do 
it tomorrow". Instead I dragged my butt off the couch and went out to 
the dunes.  Results?</P>

<P>I had so much more energy afterwards I was able to get my projects 
finished, plus my attitude was 100% better. All this and I had a 
great time!</P>

<P>The best results though, came the next day at work. Instead of 
joining in on the conversations that went "I am so tired", "I didn't 
sleep well last night" etc., I was able to tell people about the 
great sunset I saw and how much energy I had (and they loved 
that ;o) ).</P>

<P>Speaking of work, some people like to exercise during their lunch 
hours. I know...I know... you don't have time. But I  ask you. Which 
would you rather do? Sit around the lunchroom and listen to others 
complain and gossip about how awful the company and their co-workers 
are, or go outside in the fresh air, have the sun beat down on your 
face, and listen to birds?</P>

<P>Most likely you would come back to work refreshed and ready  to start 
anew. And you didn't have to drive to the gym. Even if you are only 
able to do this a couple of times a week you will notice a tremendous 
difference in how you feel.</P>

<P>Another little trick is to get a pedometer that measures how far you 
walk in a day. A friend of mine would make it a goal to walk just a 
little further every day. She said that sometimes it meant taking the 
stairs instead of the elevator, or maybe a quick walk on a break. She 
swears that she can tell a difference in her energy levels just from 
taking this small step.</P>

<P>So go out and exercise. You will notice that not only will your 
health improve, you'll smile a lot more too! :o)</P>
