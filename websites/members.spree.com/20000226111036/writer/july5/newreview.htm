<FONT size="+1"><P>An interesting and lively book from Patrick, with
                    never-before told stories of his days as an English spy,
                    and many other fantastic tales. 

                 <P>   It provides us with a look back at this century written by
                    an exceptional man at the age of 78. Many of the tales he
                    has related to us couldn't be told for the past 50 years-
                    but are ours now to read and live vicariously through
                    Patrick's eloquent prose sprinkled with his British humor. 

<P>                    Patrick tells us stories of the 2nd World War in which he
                    served in the British Expeditionary Force in France where
                    he led a force of 200 in defending London against the
                    German bombings. 

<P>                    Then, still seeking more action Patrick volunteered to
                    parachute behind enemy lines. To prepare he went to spy
                    school learning the valuable skills of forgery, burglary,
                    hand to hand combat, knife fighting and many other things
                    we see in the movies. But this wasn't a movie it was his
                    life! 

<P>                    The work he did there behind enemy lines in Germany
                    was top secret and as such could not be revealed until
                    now. 

<P>                    This is a fast paced, exciting, funny, and terrifying look
                    into the world of espionage, life, and the amazing spirit of
                    Patrick Ellam.

</a><P>
<U><I>Shadow of the Serpent: A Coyote Moon Story</I></U> is one of
                    the best Native American books I've read. Those of you
                    who know me- understand that that is quite a statement
                    as I've read well over 200 of them, and published my own
                    native american haiku. I'm not an expert in the field- but
                    pretty close. 

                  <BR>  The book is set in prehistoric North America and Joseph
                    weaves quite an extravagant story of ancient civilizations,
                    nomads, and the ever-present struggle for control of land
                    and domination over others. 

<BR>                    This work could be called action/adventure as it contains
                    plenty of both, but it also mixes fact & fantasy which leads
                    us on a spiritual journey as we view what we have made
                    of this world. The parables contained within the text are
                    insightful, and deeply provocative. James has encased
                    these moral gems into a very well crafted narrative which
                    is exciting, enticing, and eloquent. He brings us a closer
                    look at ancient rites and rituals and helps us to see the
                    need for such in our present world. 

<BR>                    This book gets my highest recommendation- a bear paw
                    salute !!

<I><U>The Wide Open Door</U></I> connects The Twelve Steps of
                    Alcoholics Anonymous to some of the world's greatest
                    spiritual philosophies - Jungian psychology, yoga, the
                    Tao, tribal rites of passage, and more. The book invites
                    us to rediscover the Source behind the Steps through
                    direct personal experience within ourselves and with our
                    Higher Power. The author discusses the experiences of
                    surrender, death and rebirth, and wholeness. He also
                    describes Eleventh Step techniques, those inner
                    experiences which maintain and deepen recovery. 

                   <P> Having read many, many self help, meditation, and
                    Twelve Step books I am somewhat of an expert in this
                    genre. Tav gives us a unique melding of spirituality, the
                    Twelve Step tradition, psychology, and mysticism.
                    Through his insight he helps us to see the Twelve Steps
                    in a new light, a more profound understanding
                    of the traditions. Blending these with a mixture of the Tao,
                    yoga, rites of passage, and Jungian psychology provides
                    a much deeper understanding of addiction and recovery.
                    The Wide Open Door is perhaps the most important
                    contribution to the addictions field in years. 

<P>                    This is a deeply personal and caring work blending
                    ancient truths with modern psychological knowledge, a
                    definite must for anyone in recovery, or those of us who
                    care about someone in recovery. </FONT>
