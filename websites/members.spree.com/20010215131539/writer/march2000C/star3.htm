<BR><P align=justify>
The verdict now in, farewell Michelle and library, and Sherlock, and dear old aunt Lorna, 

time to finally launch this frigate into the hell-bent waves of the uninhibited road to nowhere!  But first it's 

through the city port.  A port all cramped with the bustling of cars so many, and sidewalks clamoring with 

workers on route to faster food joints, for a quick smoke or a lay (wham bam thank-you uncle Sam). 

Through the indifferent streets they float like grey-ghosts, soon they'll be disappearing into the foreground 

of hyper-space America, but now its onward through this mad port, and on and on towards the 

sea until… wind catching sails, yield faster, faster, faster, yellow/white lines spitting bye this yellow 

brick road, the dove spreading wings and it's a off we go into the wide-blue yonder.  Once flying down 

the freeway it isn't long before Donny falls victim to the overzealous high of excitement (this 

tends to happen to him quite often actually, the slightest song on the radio can send him off reeling to 

the cosmos singing at the top of his lungs) .  
<P align=justify>
	"Wow, I'm feeling pretty damn inspired guys, feeling kind of like we're already one up on the 

beast, ya know, its like this just has to be the beginning of something…what it is I don't know, but I do 

know this; I've got a feeling that like where ever we're going to I really don't feel like coming back from 

ya know.  Why do we ever have to come back down?  I'd so much more rather bring the rest of the world 

with us!  That's it, that's it, all of this…this art Insano, this is where I want to live…Gone…lost in dreams, 

safe from the truth below, that's what it's all for anyway…all this art, to show us the way to paradise.  

And ya know even if our mission fails, than at least, we'll have the peace of mind knowing that we tried to 

stick it to the beast our way!! SURF AND RIP THAT CURL!!"
<P align=justify>
	Outside the dreamers window dances the muted melodiousness of slow-motion smoke-stacks 

spilling their gray-steam into the perfect blue sky of lost purity, naked baseball diamonds and playgrounds 

shoot by, submitting to a coat of fading afternoon sun. And just as Donny turns his deca-cat attention to the 

scenery he comes across a glorious sight that creates quite a stir.  
<P align=justify>
	"What the?!  Whoa maybe we should stop!"
<P align=justify>
	"Shoot, should I turn around?"
<P align=justify>
	"I don't know, they definitely look like some great characters, but uh we're not even out of Ohio 

yet…and ya know there's a slight possibility that it's a trap set by the beast."
<P align=justify>
	So unfortunately for humanity the wanderers do not stop to lend a hand to the two characters 

stranded on the side of the road.  And oh what characters! - The leader appearing to weigh at least 300 L 

B's or more wearing a bright green flourescent sombrero atop his humpty-dumpty dome.  And his partner 

tall and thin like a scarecrow all decked out in tight leather - a dynamic duo indeed!  But as their silhouettes  

Mix into the fade of the road behind the enthusiasm too begins to dwindle and yield to passenger-seat 

contentment…with…so many rush-our workers in cars racing to get home in and out of faster, slower 

traffic lanes below high-rise cut-ups of the all-mighty information high-way - giant corporate billboards - 

Why Ration Passion?  Looserville -YOU!, No Roaming!  Introducing America Choice, Look More 

Accomodating!, and on past trucks and vans with their own messages as well, and all of it spilling right on 

into the mother-brain.  With temporary road repose settling in Donny picks up one of his travel companions 

in order to seek some possible direction for the days wave.  He picks up one of his trusty books - Old Bull 

Lee's book of dreams entitled My Education.  He flips to a page any page and begins an activity that he 

decides shall become a part of the trip, - a reading into the tape-recorder.

	 <BR>

The Dream City:<P align=justify>
<P align=justify>
"Yeah, this is definitely where I've been living lately,
shit I think I'm taking you guys there with 
me." adds Donny with a chuckle. 
Then continues reading
<P align=justify>
	
The city is gray and the streets are empty. 
I am standing in front of a hotel and I can see down to 
an intersection and some billboards on a brick wall.  The only light in the city is directly in front of the 

hotel, a splash of yellow, a compromise implicit in the concept of a hotel: a place for travelers from places 

where there is yellow light.  Like a bar in a Moslem country.  The physicists tell us that nothing can exceed 

the speed of light…
<P align=justify>
	Perhaps this is a place that doesn't enter the race.  A neutral timeless space-less place of 

shadows.  I can levitate because there is no gravity here.  This is then a place at the other end of the 

spectrum from a black hole where gravity holds even light in its immeasurably impacted weight.  
<P align=justify>	
	Donny skips down to one of his favorite parts

Am I an alien?  Alien from what exactly?  Perhaps my home is the dream city, more real than my so-called 

waking life precisely because it has no relation to waking life.  In the hotel room I was afraid I would wake 

up and find it was all a dream, my ability to levitate, but I was afraid of waking up in that bed in that hotel 

room, not in my own room here in Lawrence!
<P align=justify>
	"Whoa Old Bull is awesome" comments Insano, "yeah, I'm definitely an alien, quite a 

socially inept one at that!"
<P align=justify>
	T-bone responding with an explosion of laughter - HAHAHAHAH "No shit!"
<P align=justify>
	The sky begins to darken to blue-light of early evening, filling with a haze that permeates the 

passing city-scape.  With the dimming of light Don's thoughts wander towards the possible directions of 

the journey, once again reflecting upon the ubiquitous strangeness of all he has encountered.  Things have 

just felt so odd lately, seeming more desperate than ever as if time was winding down, the constant 

dreams, coincidences, and now the slightest event somehow able to provoke his ever developing 

dream-ja-vu; and all of it, just all of it seeming to somehow connect. When did he start noticing this 

anyway, is it just paranoia? Delusions?  The constant visions, the strange relationship of it all, 

somehow intertwined.  Now this, these signs, billboards, landscapes, and the dream city, all of it 

coming together - if taken as a whole would it illuminate some kind of revelatory holy light-bright picture, 

and if so what does it mean, how long has it been impending? Does he just choose to ignore it?  'Search the 

Sublime and Ye Shall Find' thinks Donny to himself. Is he cracking up?  What an idiot!  And right the 

moment as these thoughts subside, on passenger side of dove rumbles by a big-old mac-truck with giant 

sign on its side reading:
<P align=justify>
	'Just Dial 1-800-G-O-D…Equipping kids with the gift of the Holy Power…Prayer Warfare!'
<P align=justify>
With the sight of this Donny draws his companions attention to the precarious strangeness of the moment 

where they then take notice of their where-a-bouts - "Cuy-uh-hog-I-Falls Gentlemen, we may be falling 

into the lair of the Beast!!"
<P align=justify>
The music now yielding to the melodies of Mr. Syd Barret, with the crazy diamond spinning 

whimsical rays of ethereal light shivers down spines of the celestial moment.  The three bafoons throw on 

some great retro looking wigs all bushy bushy bofandoo and begin to sing at the top of their lungs
<P align=justify>
	"When I live I die" and on and on 
<P align=justify>
	And then with a burst of wild vibrato Donny out the window bellowing with the lamb mask in 

hand 

"The Lamb is levitating!!" getting more romantic with each croon "I hold this lamb out the 

window as an offer to Ohio" -and suddenly noticing  "that I leave behind!"  So much excitement seems 

to rush in all at once. 
<P align=justify>
 "Holy shit Its Chip Douglas with his Dodge Sport!"  yells Donny at some grouchy dude 

speeding by the dove in his oversized monster-truck.  The dude rolls by road-raging - obviously quite 

upset about something.  Then its the Captain nearly swerving off the road as his eyes encounter yet another 

strange and wonderful sight 
<P align=justify>
 "Deer now barking at the Zoo!  Whoa I think I'm gonna have to turn around fellas!"

<P align=justify>	But the frenzied high of excitement slowly weans to traffic-jam impatience and a road anxiety that 

forces the heroes to trek onward.  Forever left to wonder what it sounds like to hear a deer bark.  Donny 

glares out the window at the beautiful landscape of green valley all coated with late supper glow.  Syd now 

strumming gently and lamenting softly 
<BR>
	'My head kissed the ground,
<BR>
	 I was half the way down
<BR>
	 Please lift a hand, I'm only a person
<BR>
	 Won't you miss me, wouldn't you miss me at all?!'
<P align=justify>
A Melancholy gush of wind sweeps on in through and around Donny carrying him away to a state of 

meditative sadness, all the traveling going by so fast, he looks into the rear-view mirror at his little brother 

T-bone, - 'objects in mirror are closer than they appear' - 'they sure as hell are!'  he thinks as he waxes up 

his board, catches wave and writes onward a ballad about their rusting days of Peter Pan time.  

<P align=justify>When Don finishes writing it doesn't take long for the comfort of road repose to settle back in 

with time slipping on by outside windows of vast farmland - grazers grazing on hills, Old general the cow 

keeping watch of all his ladies, tobacco barns, scarecrows, crows, amber-rippled ponds, wells, dinner 

bells, and on through cities and their shopping centers of attention and out again back to the wide-open 

manure stained wind of the gentle country.  Temporarily comfortable in their animate environment the 

three goof-balls get back to doing what they do best - goofing.  Donny picks up the tape-recorder and 

begins the moments sermon with "Enlightenment…Enlightenment is….alright guys we need to get this 

right o.k. I'll go first,…Enlightenment is…Alex Trabek with a nuevo, iridescent hair-weave walking a 

Bresian Fresia."
<P align=justify>
	And they each take their turns until this grows dull.
<P align=justify>
	"Enlightenment is

"…a basket of hot-fried tits on Thanksgiving Morning"
<P align=justify>
	"…A walk through the mystery maze of midgets while wearing a blindfold"
<P align=justify>
	"…A pile of hunch-back mongoloids with serpent tongues…"    "YUCK, what the?!"
<P align=justify>
	"…Enlightenment is …wait…shhhhh…there it is…did you here it…listen carefully…ah-ha-ha…"
	<P align=justify>

<BR><CENTER><HR></CENTER><BR>
<CENTER><B><U>Chapter 3 Enter the Beast</U></B></CENTER>
<P align=justify>
	With the road darkening under light of harvest moon, evening slips into its cloak.  The heroes 

grow tired, hungry, disoriented with each passing mile.  (Meanwhile the skeleton composes his symphony 

of evil)  Suddenly a break in silence comes a howling from back seat, as T-bone launches into song
<P align=justify>
	"Summon the Beast …dom dom dom…Summon the Beast…dom dom dom"  
<P align=justify>
	   -the others joining in

	"Summon the Beast…for the feast…Summon the Beast cause we're heading back east.

	  So step away from your death beds where ya lay your sweet heads

	  Stop watching…Start moving…Stop watching…Start moving

	  And Summon that Beast out from within your sweet head" 
<P align=justify>
And then, moments into the diddy, on the oncoming traffic side of the road - passing them by comes the 

wreckage of road-rage accident  - ambulance lights flickering, as a couple of bodies are pulled from 

beneath a totaled car.  
<P align=justify>
	"Holy shit what did we do?"  asks a frazzled Donny Queen.  "We summoned the beast, and he 

obviously answered!  Oh man T-bone maybe we shouldn't gotten so cocky, that song may have been a bit 

too much."
<P align=justify>
	"Yeah…" adds Insano  "…now what do we do…the bastards surely going to have it out for us, 

 I mean not that he hasn't had it for us all along, but now he's really gonna be pissed!"
<P align=justify>
	"Maybe we should stop somewhere for some coffee or something…what do you guys think?  Plus 

we should probably start looking for a place to shack-up before it gets too dark, and frankly I really 

don't feel like taking any chances right now man."  Suggests Don.
<P align=justify>
	So the Captain pulls off the highway and begins lookout for someplace to take refuge, grab some 

coffee, and regroup.  The road he chooses spirals steeply up-slope betwixt giant pines, the Alleghini's near.  

Headlights illuminate the way through slide-show fog, revealing signs, roads ahead, until finally they

encounter a wooden block with the words "WOLF'S DEN NEXT RIGHT" inscribed in it.  

<P align=justify>	"Whoa, the wolf's den?! Should we go there guys?"  
<P align=justify>
Affirmative, so its into the Wolf's Den they go.  Insano pulls into the vacated lot, only a few other cars in 

sight.  The three hobo's jump on out of the car and stretch like they mean it ahhhhhh.  With arms outward 

yawning and head rotating to stretch neck, Donny sighs a long sigh, deep-breath and looks at night-sky.  

The moon is full, a couple of bat shaped clouds float waveously by changing shape as they do.  Off in the 

distance of the pine-cone woods a howling of wind or is it a wolf, a werewolf?  Why not the freek'n camp 

ground looks so much like a commune from the howling anyway.  The heroes wander on over near the 

office and sure enough - no vacancy. A sign on the office directs them around the corner to where the food 

is.  They walk on by past the log-cabin office on into the Den through a meek narrow gate boardering a 

swimming pool.  The pool is empty, abandoned, only a few neglected baby floats bobbing up 

and down in the lonely water.  Past the pool to the dinner they head, Donny leads the way impatiently, 

opens door and in they go, juke box kicks on - Elvis Presley's 'I can't help falling in love with you'.  The 

diner is filled with empty tables only vases and flowers their companions, the hickory walls decorated with 

doughnut records and portraits of famous werewolves.  Don and gang waltz over to counter, plop down on 

the stools where they're greeted by the daughter of Mr. Woolfey himself, her merchant eyes slightly shut 

and already dreaming of some far away place, any other place, just not this old Wolf's den in the middle of 

where? Pennsylvania.  
<P align=justify>
"What can I get you guyz?"
<P align=justify>
Whoa!! Donny sees exactly what she can get for him, and it's so cute and oh so young, and dizzy 

all full of ra-ra spirit prancing in and out of the kitchen, blond pony tail bouncing all about with each giddy 

little step she takes.
<P align=justify>
"I'll have…..uh….a small order of Wolfey Wafers with cheese, and uh would it be possible to get some 

coffee?"
<P align=justify>And then to the denial of his wounded heart comes
<P align=justify>
"Charity doll, would ya get that for me."
<P align=justify>
'Charity! Charity! Oh of all the sick jokes to be played on mercenary hearts!'  thinks Donny and 

then conversing with the Almighty in the motherbrain 'Well Father…I could sure as hell use some charity 

right about now!'  But then catching himself and that beast too, to Insano he whispers -

"Oh man,I think the beast has got the best of me for the moment, so uh would ya like pass me that 

knife so I can prevent my soul from being thrown into a fiery pit of hell!"
