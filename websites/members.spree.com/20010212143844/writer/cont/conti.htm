 born in Antwerp, Belgium in 1970. After studying

                                      Modern Languages and basics in Jazz music, he worked as a

                                      secretary/translator for four years, and in 1998 decided to devote his life

                                      to the Arts of Music, Poetry and Life.

                                      Over the past two years his poems have been widely published in

                                      American, English, Dutch & even one Australian litmag, incl. Chiron

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00007F" SIZE="-1">

began writing at the age of 11 when he realized the air was made of letters, which he could 

breathe in and breathe out words. Says Jaffe, "Life is a poem and I write it." He is

committed to returning poetry to the people and speaks strongly about the role of poetry and poets in today's society. 

From the sensually romantic to humor to social commentary, Jaffe impacts audiences with a

rich emotional range, masterfully crafted. His poetry appears in numerous anthologies, 

magazines, and on the internet where he has pioneered web sites that feature poetry of

others as well as his own. His recent books include <U>Unprotected Poetry</U>, <U>Hate's Not Natural</u>, <U>Winter Rose</U>,

 and <U>Jewish Soul Food</U>. 

At the Moondog Cafe in Hollywood, Larry hosts PoeticLicense, rated one of the hottest, 

high-energy venues in Southern California Cal. He strives to provide a safe haven for poets

to bring their works alive.

He has also created <U>PoeticLicenseNEWS</U>, an online newsletter,

featuring an international poet's forum, poetry news bulletin board, an open mike, and local

poetic news for So. Cal. Jaffe has conducted featured readings throughout the country,

including Las Vegas, and three Austin tours, where he has read during the Austin International

Poetry Festival, and at such venues as Waterloo Ice House, and  Heritage House. In his SoCal home base, Larry has featured at the

                 Comedy Store, Borders Books, Celebrity Centre, the Onyx, Beyond

                 Baroque, Magic Johnson's Starbucks and many others. He has just

                 completed a five state tour with features at such venues as Jus Gumbo

                 in Fairhope, Ala, Myth.com in Washington, D.C., the Iota Poetry

                 Series in Arlington Va., 13 Bar Lounge in NYC, Cantab Lounge in

                 Boston and Prodigal Son Coffeehouse in Hyanis.

<hr><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1">Lottie James </FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1">Annie James lives on the Somerset levels in the West of England in a

                 converted dairy barn surrounded by fields and bound on the South by

                 the River Sheppey and to the north by a road that, in living memory,

                 was only a cart track. 

                 Before being diagnosed with narcolepsy she ran her own successful

                 managment consultancy company and in the last year that she worked

                 trained nearly 500 engineers in change management and leadership.

                 Little did she know how much she would have to put those "change

                 management theories" into practice herself. 

                 Since then her life has been chaotic and sometimes catastophic as a

                 consequence of confusing diagnoses and various hard-hitting

                 neurological treatments, none of which have worked. 

                 Unwilling to accept a life of helpless disability she bought a

                 computer and covered it with a tablecloth for about a year. Then she

                 struggled with getting to grips with it for about another year -

                 outraged that the system she had invested in and had yet to use was

                 completely out of date by then - and began writing. 

                 "Barking at the Apple in the River" is her first work. The title came

                 to her one day when, sat with a demon focus writing on her on the

                 computer, she was finding it increasingly difficult to ignore the

                 incessant barking of her otherwise beloved dog Bridget. She did not

                 want to break her concentration to see what was wrong but in the end

                 she snapped. 

                 The black border-collie/labrador cross was stood at the end of the

                 garden besides herself with anger and frustration -"barking at the

                 apple in the river." It was caught, enticingly in a reed bed. She

                 could see what she wanted and she wanted it more than anything else.

                 She had whipped herself into a frenzy of frustration and it was not

                 making one jot of difference. There was no way that she could reach

                 it. The bank was too steep, the water was too high, the distance to

                 it was too far... 

                 When her owner saw the situation she collapsed with laughter,

                 forgetting completely her own frusration. The dog neither appreciated

                 this nor did she think it funny. 

                 How many times, she thought to herself, had she been in that

                 situation? How many times?

I thought I'd include a little info about

myself to 

accompany the story, so read on.  I'm a graduating senior of the

class of 

2000 (best class of all time), who's on his way to Georgia State

University, 

to major in middle school education.  My interest's include reading

(anything 

that catches my interest), writing (when I actually get the nerve

to :) ) 

playing an occasional game of basketball, hanging with my friends,

catching a 

movie, or just chilling.



I try to live my life by this famous quote stated by the noted

novelist 

Samuel Langhorne Clemens, "Always do right.  This will gratify some

people 

and astonish the rest."  It's a good quote to live your life by, i

think.  

Peace to all who read this.  Stay cool.

resides in Pennsylvania. Although Verda Publishing usually features

                 the work of women poets of North Dakota, Laura Johnson is an emerging

                 voice whose song could not be ignored. She is an alchemist whose

                 sensual and delicate compounding of earth, water, air and fire has

                 given us "Elements," her first publication and a star in Verda's

                 crown. Laura Johnson is also a dedicated publicist for new poets and

                 has arranged public poetry readings throughout several eastern

                 states. She can be contacted at her <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/KisTendrly/index.html" TARGET="_blank">website</A>

                 http://angelfire.com/me/EJpoetry/index.html My introduction to poetry

                 came unexpectedly but I'm enjoying my latest venture imensely, two

                 lines of poetry I've written explains why I write:- 'I feel the need

                 as them, those poets past, to show my heart for all to see, And if I

                 touch but one with mine, then sweet success has come to me.'
