	<P>Yvvone (not her real name) thought the world as she knew it was over after 
her boyfriend left her for someone else. In a moment of desperation she took 
her life. Do you ever wonder why women do such drastic things? I have on many 
occasions.
</P>
<P>It's fear that drive women to kill themselves. Fear of being alone. In this 
culture being alone is associated with being lonely and unwanted. There's a 
difference between the two words:<BR>

<DIV ALIGN="center">Alone-1. means to be apart from any other. 2. to be solitary or free.
Lonely-1. means lone, companionless. 2. destitute of  sympathetic, friendly 
companionship, or relationships.</DIV></P>

<P>As you can see the definitions are different. In this culture women are 
raised to think if they're alone they must be lonely. Yvvone couldn't deal 
with the idea of being "lonely" so she took what she thought was the easy way 
out and killed herself. </P>

<P>Facing the pain of being without romantic companionship could've quite 
possibly left her a stronger person for having experienced it. We will never 
know in her case. There are some of you going through trials and tribulations 
in your life, many of which many be related to relationship loss. Don't give 
up, the pain will subside. </P>

<P>The first step to healing after a dissolved relationship is to focus on 
yourself. No I don't mean beating yourself up for having flaws. I suggest 
looking at your character imperfections to constructively correct them. If 
you found during the relationship you were very needy of that person's time 
and energy apparently there's a insecurity issue to be faced.</P>

<P>Seek counseling. Don't let the so-called "chicness" of having a therapist 
deprive you of any benefits to be had from seeking this service. If 
counseling is what you need, then go to one that specializes in single issues.
</P>
<P>Don't think you need counseling? Set aside an hour or more each day to focus 
on the direction you want to travel in your life. Identify the image you want 
for yourself. More importantly be alone, don't make the mistake most women 
make by hiding in a crowd. They believe if they keep themselves surrounded 
with people the pain of losing a companion would go away. It don't, it's put 
on the backburner for later. </P>

<P>Manage your time wisely, don't spend it rehashing old mistakes. Negatively 
thinking in past tense will not help your present situation so move on. 
Feeling like you can't make it? Know that you can and will providing you let 
go of your past hurts and focus on making you the best you can be.
</P>
<P>Whenever you feel out of control it's time to invite a therapist in to aid 
you in your recovery. There's no relationship in this world worth more than 
your life, suicide should never be considered. Rest assured, you're not going 
through anything someone else hasn't been through and overcame.</P>
