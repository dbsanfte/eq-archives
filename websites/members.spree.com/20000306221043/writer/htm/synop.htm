THE MYSTERY OF SYNOPSIS

Is that there is no mystery to it. It is not the same thing as a query
letter, nor is it the same as an outline. Although, there are some
similarities between the three, it is best to overlook the similarities
and concentrate on the differences.

A synopsis will need to give a sense of who your characters are, since 
characters are the central focus of any novel. Also contained in the 
synopsis should be the thread that binds the book together , or the theme,
along with a chapter by chapter breakdown of the action , plot, and 
subplots. The situations,the circumstances, the actions of the characters ,
and the ending of your story must all work together to prove your theme.
In the synopsis you will give a quick insight into how this is accomplished.


The major difference between a synopsis and an outline is that the
outline is nothing but a chapter by chapter, brief summary of your plot.
Whereas the synopsis should be much more extensive and in depth, detailing 
major plot points, conflicts, goals, and sub-plots of the characters. The
synopsis should reveal the ending - it’s not good to leave the editor 
wondering how it is all resolved. Remember the point of a well written
synopsis is to sell the work, not hook an editor as you would a reader.
Editor’s in general do not have the time to play guessing games, theirs is
a business decision and not a contest of favoritism. Would you invest major
money into a project, say a mutual fund that had high risk, without knowing
every single aspect of the investment? Well, neither will the wise editor.

Imagine your synopsis as a virtual reality or 3-d map of your novel. You 
want to take the editor through the twists turns bumps and highs and lows
of the trip ahead.  This map should take them to the summit of your story,
with each successive point rising higher  towards the ultimate destination -
the summit of your story.

The synopsis should be rather matter of fact, saving your creative prose
for the body of the work. It is a tool, a sales pitch, and should come 
directly to the point. Depending on the complexity and length of your novel
a synopsis can run from 20 pages to 50 or more. Be sure that it is concise
and contains no more than it needs to to deliver a good sales pitch, while
at the same time highlighting and detailing your characters, their 
motivations, plots, sub-plots, conflicts, and resolutions.

I’ll agree that it is not an easy act to write a “perfect” synopsis. I
doubt that there is such a creature anyway. It’s all relative and editors 
are people with different points of view. One editor may think your synopsis
is brilliant while another finds it boorish. But now that you know at least
what should be contained in the synopsis, your task may be a bit easier.
