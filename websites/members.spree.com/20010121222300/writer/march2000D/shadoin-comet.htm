CLEM'S COMET<FONT size="+2"><BR>

<P align=justify>
Few events occurring in Rock Creek caused as little stir in Rock Creek
as Clem's Comet.  Perhaps because it was developed and built in secret
and that all the participants were under the age of 13 that the Rock
Creek Chronicle failed to give it the full front page coverage it
deserved.  Perhaps because if any of the participants' parents had
discovered what had happened, school would have been called off for the
entire month of January while various backsides slowly stopped throbbing
and the swelling went down.  Instead, a clandestine gathering put on one
of the greatest feats of human achievement since the original Olympic
Games.
<P align=justify>
It all started because Tom Warden wouldn't buy a sled for Clem.  Tom
claimed that Clem would break his fool neck and he was in no mood to
discuss with his mother all the stupidity his father demonstrated by
strapping her only son on a steel and wood contraption meant for all out
speed with no brakes, if you don't count snowdrifts and the occasional
tree.  So, Clem decided instead to demonstrate some of that ingenuity
his father was so sure every boy should demonstrate and build his own.
<P align=justify>
Owning a feed store and lumber yard has its advantages.  There's plenty
of stuff to build other stuff out of.  For rails, an old hay bale
elevator would provide pre-bent material.  There were plenty of pallets
to knock apart for the planking and if a fellow didn't mind the
occasional splinter, they didn't sit too bad either.  For steering, Clem
added a pair of hand brakes which were really only more pallet boards
that pivoted on a single nail hammered into the side of the seat
planks.  For added comfort, and because there were still boards left,
Clem decided to add a roll bar/push bar combination that doubled as a
seat back.  The entire contraption was a little less than eleven feet
long and weighed about two hundred and forty pounds.  Only an eighth of
an ounce of the entire weight were nails and bolts holding the
contraption together.  An engineering oversight that thirteen year old
boys were apt to make at least once.
<P align=justify>
It took Clem and four others to pull the sled to the top of the Widow
Maker Hill.  Since the sled could hold all five, no one felt too out of
place sweating in the sub freezing weather, pulling 'Clem's Comet' to
the apex of the only hill suitable for an event of this magnitude.
During the summer months, the exposed rock slopes of  the Widow Maker
were unassailable without special equipment.  During the winter,
exceptionally brave high school and college students would mount the
lesser slopes with traditional sleds and innertubes and go careening out
of control down the slope, ending always in a pile at the bottom.  But
Clem, Rockhead, Big Mike, Okie Bob and Geezer Hoak were extraordinary
youth on an impossible mission.  They felt confident that from that day
forward, the Widow Maker would be known as Comet Hill.
<P align=justify>
It took most of the morning to drag the Comet to the top of the best
slope on Widow Maker.  The racing committee discussed using a towing
device for future runs, already envisioning selling tickets to what was
certain to be known statewide as the most exciting thing since the
roller coaster.  There was little fanfare and no speechifying at the top
of the hill.  Geezer was placed out front because he was smallest and
the quickest to get out of trouble, should trouble develop.  Okie Bob
was second, his growing bulk would be needed for ballast as the front of
the sled gathered speed.  Clem was third, manning the two hand brakes
that were going to save the lives of the Comet riders if  trouble
occurred.  Big Mike and Rockhead were going to push off and then leap
aboard.
<P align=justify>
With everyone situated, Big Mike and Rockhead gave a less than mighty
shove before gravity took over and sucked the Clem Comet down the face
of the Widow Maker.  Only a super human leap by Big Mike allowed him to
get aboard.  Rockhead was fortunate that his mittens caught on a large
sliver and was drug down hill long enough for Big Mike to reach back and
haul him aboard.  When Big Mike looked forward again, all he could see
was white as the snow the front of the Comet kicked up blinded him.
Clem immediately sensed trouble and quickly removed the brakes by
pulling on them, so they wouldn't be damaged he claimed later.  The
Comet approached the speed of light in about forty five feet and the
swelling had hardly started in Rockhead's hand when he was slammed
backward against the backrest by a panic stricken Big Mike.  Nobody had
ever traveled that fast before, nor would they have believed that half
of a hay bale elevator could achieve that speed.  What should have been
eight hundred feet of careening fun became eight seconds of the wildest
ride any bull could give.
<P align=justify>
At the end of the first hundred feet, Okie Bob realized that his seat
was sliding to the right and off of the sled.  Some of the boards hadn't
been securely fastened, and a few of those were carrying his ample
derriere to the right, exposing them to fly rocks and snow kicked up by
the Comet.  Only fear saved his life, as well as amazing catlike
reflexes for a youngster of his bulk.  Soon the boards were abandoned
leaving Okie Bob supporting himself with his hands and adrenaline.  At
two hundred feet Geezer decided that the front of the Comet was going to
meet with an untimely end and decided to exchange places with Okie Bob.
Okie Bob would have none of that, even if it meant getting his butt back
on semisolid wood.  So Geezer decided to exchange places with Clem or
Big Mike and a small bump put him atop Rockhead's shoulders instead with
a death grip on Big Mike's forehead.
<P align=justify>
The stress of the sudden shift in the center of gravity caused nearly
all the remaining boards to disconnect from the hay elevator frame.
Only Clem's quick thinking saved the two boards that were to serve as
brakes.  It became apparent at three hundred feet that he was going to
have to deploy the brakes real soon.  So he did.  The sudden deployment
of the emergency braking system caused them to separate from the vehicle
without any noticeable effect.  Clem made a note of this for Clem's
Comet II, for at four hundred feet, it was apparent Clem's Comet, The
Original, would only be making a maiden voyage.  At five hundred feet
the force of air coming from the mouths of the five Comet Riders in the
form of Death Screams was beginning to have a slowing effect on the
sled.  They actually slowed down to under a hundred miles an hour before
the ground fell away again and they had to inhale so they could continue
screaming.
<P align=justify>
Everyone had a firm grip on the sled with the exception of Geezer, who
still had a firm grip on Big Mike.  Big Mike was a little glad that
Geezer had a hold of his forehead because Geezer's right arm was
blocking the snow that had been pelting him in the face.  The drawback
was that he couldn't see at all and would later have to have the trip
described to him because he had seen so little.
<P align=justify>
A passerby would have described the scene as viewed from below.  "It was
an avalanche that occasionally spewed out a piece of rough-cut one by
four and sounded for all the world like it contained a full complement
of dying banshees."
<P align=justify>
From the Comet it was a terrifying ride inside an avalanche that sounded
for all the world like it contained a full complement of dying banshees.
Only Big Mike wasn't screaming.  He was laughing.  Big Mike is extremely
ticklish and the death grip or Rockheads legs around his waist was
causing him a fit of giggles.
<P align=justify>
At six hundred feet Clem was already trying to determine how to dismount
at the bottom of the hill with dignity.  At seven hundred feet, Clem was
divvying up his property amongst his surviving friends.  At seven
hundred and fifty feet, the Comet reached the bottom of the steepest
portion of the hill and began to level out.  At eight hundred feet
several fillings were loosened with a bone-jarring slam as the Comet
changed directions with the ground slope.    Now they were hurtling
along at under a hundred miles per hour and headed directly for Rock
Creek.
<P align=justify>
At this part of Rock Creek, banks are about fifteen feet above the water
and a hundred feet apart.  The Comet left the near bank and immediately
separated from its human cargo.
<P align=justify>
Geezer traveled the farthest across the field on the far bank.  And to
make it look more difficult, he did it upside down while gouging a
trench in the snow with only his head.  They later found most of Geezer
lying in a hump of snow and found the rest of him nearby with only a
minimum of digging.  Okie Bob rolled across the field like a good fat
kid should.  The snow stuck to his flannel shirt and when he finally
stood up, could have passed for a tire spokesperson.  Big Mike and
Rockhead landed flat on their behinds and skidded in the gouge made by
Geezer's head until they were stopped by the snowball that was Okie
Bob.  Clem stayed with the Comet until the front of the sled took
purchase in the far bank causing the back-end to catapult forward.
Since the behind side of Clem Warden was in the way, he became airborne
for the second time in two seconds and from his overhead position he
marked the resting places of each of his friends, in case the search
party was going to need him to help uncover the bodies.  Clem landed
mostly upright just short of Geezer.  He simply bent over and lifted
Geezer up and the two of them walked back to help Rockhead and Big Mike
to their feet, stepping none to daintily on a prone ball of snow that
was Okie Bob.
<P align=justify>
They discovered their mistake when they finally could count high enough
and remember enough to realize that one of their number was missing.
The muffled cries from inside the snow mound brought them to Okie Bob's
aid.  It took a bit of doing to kick the snow from Okie Bob, since none
of the Comet's passengers had use of their fingers or hands yet.  A
quick survey of the results of their experiment brought them to the
realization they were on the wrong side of Rock Creek.  They decided it
would be easier to walk to Hoak's to warm up and catch a ride back to
town than to walk the long way around to the bridge and back into town.
They only spent a few minutes examining the scar on Comet Hill.  Then
they trudged off to the Hoaks for hot chocolate and oatmeal cookies.
<P align=justify>
When they got back to town, word quickly spread about the triumph of the
Comet Five.  Doubters need only to trek out to Comet Hill to see the
gouge and the scattered boards on the slopes if to become believers.
<P align=justify>
The Comet Five never built Clem's Comet II.  Tom needed to little
convincing to keep Clem on smaller slopes.  In fact, Clem gave up hill
sliding altogether.  Instead, with the hood of an old Packard, the Comet
Five created the sport of tractor skiing that is still being practiced
around Rock Creek today.
