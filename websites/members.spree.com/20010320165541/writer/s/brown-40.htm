<P>We've all heard the expression, and, when that day looms up, we
start to use it ourselves and accept it as a Truth. However,
nobody has ever fully explained why it is true.</P>
<P>
It intrigued me for years until I uncovered the answer in a most
unexpected place. It lay hidden between the pages of Napoleon
Hill's masterpiece, "Think & Grow Rich" ! There under the chapter
entitled "The Secrets Of Sex Transmutation" I found this
remarkable quotation :-</P>

<P>"I discovered, from the analysis of over 25,000 people, that men
who succeed in an outstanding way, seldom do so before the age of
forty, and more often they do not strike their real pace until
they are well beyond the age of fifty. This fact was so
astounding that it prompted me to go into the study of its cause
most carefully.</P>

<P>This study disclosed the fact that the major reason why the
majority of men who succeed do not begin to do so before the age
of forty to fifty, is their tendency to dissipate their energies
through over-indulgence in physical expression of the emotion of
sex. The majority of men never learn that the urge of sex has
other possibilities, which far transcend in importance that of
mere physical expression.</P>

<P>The majority of those who make this discovery, do so after having
wasted many years at a period when sex energy was at its height,
prior to the age of forty to fifty. This is usually followed by
noteworthy achievement.</P>

<P>The lives of many men up to, and sometimes well past the age of
forty, reflect a continued dissipation of energies, which could
have been more profitably turned into better channels. Their
finer and more powerful emotions are sown wildly to the four
winds. Out of this habit grew the term "sowing his wild oats."</P>

<P>The desire for sexual expression is by far the strongest and most
impelling of all the human emotion because, when harnessed and
transmuted into action, other than that of physical expression,
it may raise one to great accomplishment."</P>
<P>
I not only found this interesting but was impressed, not to
mention greatly encouraged by the whole thing. He was talking
here about the use of sexual energy as a 'mind stimulant' and
listed all ten of the other mind stimulants known to man as:-</P>

<P>1. The desire for sex expression.<BR>
2. Love<BR>
3. A burning desire for fame, fortune, power or financial gain.<BR>
4. Music<BR>
5. Friendship between either those of the same or opposite sex<BR>
6. A Master Mind Alliance based on the harmony of two or more
people who ally themselves for spiritual or temporal advancement<BR>
7. Mutual suffering, such as that experienced by people who are
persecuted<BR>
8. Autosuggestion<BR>
9. Fear<BR>
10. Narcotics or alcohol<BR></P>

<P>He cited many examples of men and women who have attained the
status of genius as a result of using the 'artificial' mind
stimulants of narcotics and alcohol. Men like James Whitcomb
Riley who did his best writing whilst under the influence of
alcohol.</P>
<P>
Perhaps that's where he saw "the ordered intermingling of the
real and the dream, the mill above the river, and the mist above
the stream". However, such men have often destroyed themselves
in the process.</P>

<P>Nature has prepared her own potions with which men and women may
stimulate their minds as you can see from the list above. The
desire for sex expression heads the list because it is the most
powerful of all. No one of them, nor all of them combined, can
equal the driving force of sex when properly channelled.</P>

<P>Napoleon Hill explains later in that chapter that :-</P>

<P>"Through these sources one may commune with Infinite
Intelligence, or enter at will, the storehouse of the
subconscious mind, either one's own, or that of another person, a
procedure which is all there is of genius."</P>

<P>Between the ages of about thirty and forty, a man or woman begins
to learn, if they ever learn at all, the art of sex
transmutation, that is, the turning of sexual energy into others
forms of productive effort. "Throwing yourself into your work"
might be one way of expressing this.</P>

<P>This discovery is often made by accident and we could remain
totally unconscious of it. We may simply observe that our powers
of achievement have increased between these ages and never become
aware of the cause.</P>

<P>The truth is that Nature begins to harmonise the emotions of love
and sex in the individual between these ages so that they may
draw upon these great forces and apply them jointly as stimuli to
other productive action.</P>

<P>It is encouraging to learn that most people don't even enter into
highly creative pursuits of any kind before the age of forty and
that the average person reaches the period of their greatest
capacity to create between the ages of forty and sixty !</P>

<P>This period must not be approached with fear and trembling, but
with new hope and anticipation. We must get out there and make
some new plans.</P>

<P>The pages of history are full of people who started to succeed
after the age of forty but here are just a couple of more recent
examples.</P>

<P>I just finished  watching a TV show with highlights from "On Tour
With Tina" a documentary of Tina Turner's "2000 World Tour" which
she is doing with Lionel Richie as the co-star. Tina's solo
career didn't even get off the ground till she was aged 40 and
here she is rocking them in the aisles at age 60 and still
looking good on it too !</P>

<P>Tom Jones made his TV debut with "It's Not Unusual" in 1969 and
went on to star in Las Vegas along with big names like Elvis
Presley and Frank Sinatra. Now in his late fifties, he has just
launched his new album "Reload" and is busy successfully
promoting it all around the world. The list just goes on and on
and it's not all show-biz either.</P>

<P>Just look around, there are examples everywhere. Life really does
begin at 40. Now, instead of wondering how or why ? we now know
that this is how it was meant to be and that "Great Beginnings"
and 'Great Comebacks' are not only possible but quite normal, at
any age whatsoever.</P>

<P>I don't know about you, but I think this is really great news !</P>
