	<P>Got the colder weather, sour relationshops, no money, poor 
health, plain ol' down 'n dirty blues? Try some of these 
strategies to blow away those dark clouds and let the 
sunshineinto your life again.</P>

<P>1) Dance!  Put on your favourite music, turn it up loud and 
dance!  This is guaranteed to make you feel good.  If you 
are unable to dance, don't let that stop you having fun - 
sing at the top of your voice instead.</P>

<P>2) Smile!  Force yourself to smile even if you don't feel 
like it.  This tricks your brain into thinking that you are 
happy.  You do want to be happy don't you?  Okay then - a 
great big cheesy grin. After three, one, two, three, - smile:0)</P>

<P>3) Spend time with children.  Their natural zest for life is 
infectious.  As well as the pleasures of a spontaneous hug or 
a chubby little hand in yours, try to take away with you some 
of their joy in simple things, licking an ice cream, playing
with water, tramping through fallen leaves or following a 
butterfly.</P>
<P>4) Reward yourself.  If there is a job that you hate to do, 
household accounts, home repairs etc. don't keep putting it 
off so that it is constantly nagging at you.  Just get it 
done.  Then reward yourself with whatever you love, a shiny 
new magazine, a bunch of flowers, a long soak in an aromatic 
bath, two bars of chocolate or an evening in front of the
tv doing absoutely nothing.  Or even all of the above if you 
can afford it.  The peace of mind that comes from having got 
the job done will be the greatest reward of all.</P>

<P>5) Clear out your clutter.  The ancient art of Feng Shui 
believes that getting rid of clutter rids your home or work 
space of negative stuck energy and allows space for positive 
energy to surge into all aspects of your life.  Whether or
not this is correct, it is an undeniable fact that clearing 
out what you no longer want or need makes life easier.  Your 
home is neater, looks more spacious and is easier to clean.
There can also be a tremendous feeling of freedom as you let 
go of the past and trust in the future to bring you what you 
will need. Emotional clutter can be even more damaging.
We've all said or done things we regret, the trick is to do 
anything you can to repair the damage and if that is not 
possible, forgive yourself and toss it out of your life.</P>


<P>6) Take action.  If something is worrying you, be it a 
health problem, or debt or divorce, make that doctor's 
appointment, get some debt counselling, find out your rights.  
The reality is often less stressful than sitting alone 
worrying about it.  Try to talk over your problems with a 
friend, or if that is impossible find a support group on the 
Internet by typing debt, divorce or whatever into a search 
engine.</P>

<P>7) Positive thoughts.  When you leave the house each morning, 
say and mean, I'm going to have a great day, it's going to 
be lots of fun, rather than thinking, Oh no, another dreary 
day at the office to get through.  The first attitude will
attract good vibrations and positive fun people to you, the 
second will ensure a depressing day.</P>

<P>8) Have more fun.  Apparently children laugh approximately 
400 times a day yet adults laugh only about 20 times a day. 
When do we lose our sense of fun?  Claim it back.  Play games, 
watch comedies, have daily jokes delivered to your mailbox or 
throw a fancy dress party.</P>

<P>9) Make something.  Being creative gives you such a buzz 
you won't stay down in the dumps for long.  Stencil a room, 
make a cake, plan a garden, sketch or paint a picture.  
Express yourself with a modern collage, change your
rooms around, display your collections or start a patchwork 
quilt.</P>

<P>10) Keep a gratitude journal.  Write down half a dozen 
things every day that you are grateful for, from waking up 
and seeing your children's beautiful little faces to the smell 
of the rosesin the local park.  This cannot fail to cheer
you up if you do it regularly as it gives you a whole new 
way of experiencing your life.</P>

<P>11) Start a new project.  Learn a language, trace your 
family history, redecorate your home, learn to ride a horse, 
gain a new qualification, take music lessons, learn to 
make your own soft furnishings or do your own auto repairs.  
Visualize yourself successfully completing the project and 
the benefits it will bring to your life. Then make a start 
and follow it through to the end.  An added bonus will be
the increased self esteem that comes from having planned, 
problem solved and perfected the whole project yourself.</P>

<P>12) See your old friends.  It's easy to get into a work, 
family, housework, shopping, sleep and back to work again 
routine that leaves you no time at all to be the person you 
once were. The funny, up for a laugh, outgoing young woman 
you used to be. Spending time with friends who knew the old 
you seems to reseurrect that side of your character. You will 
come away feeling younger, more positive and excited by life 
than you were before you met up.  Go on, invite them over to 
share a pizza and catch up on each other's lives.</P>

<P>13) Paint or accessorize a room that you spend a lot of time 
in a lovely bright yellow.  The colour of sunshine will lift 
your spirit and bring positive vibrations. We subconciously 
know about the effects of colour on our emotions which is 
why we talk about the future looking rosy or having the blues.</P>

<P>14) Take the happiness option.  You have the choice whether 
to spend this day, which you will never live through again, 
in a state of happiness or unhappiness.  Choose to spend it 
as happily as you possibly can.</P>
