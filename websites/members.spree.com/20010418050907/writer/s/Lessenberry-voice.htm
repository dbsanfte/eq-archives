<P>"I should have listened to the little voice inside my head.  It told me
that something was wrong.  When I don't listen to the little voice,
something always goes wrong."</P>

<P>We've all said that at one time or another, usually 100s of times
during our lives. Believe it or not, the little voice is part of a normal
thinking process. Unfortunately, we can't summons the little voice
anytime we want to. But there is a way to double-check the little
voice to see what it's telling us.</P>
<P>
Please be advised that I didn't hear a little voice telling me to write
this article. I learned this thought process while participating in a
study of Southern creative writers. (A study of the thought process
of writers, not their writings.)</P>

<P>First, let's assume that you already have a website and you are
considering new distributorship programs. You have decided that
none of them is exactly right. But you need extra money, so
you pick one that your associate, or spouse, thinks might work.</P>

<P>But then, the little voice, the uneasy feeling, or .... something
tells you not to do it.</P>

<P>First, get all the information together that you have on the dealership,
especially ads. Go to the website. Start a list of
"product features" set forth in this information.</P>

<P>You will see things like: "We're positioned to be the world's leading
cyber hamburger cooker".  "Our marketing plan calls for running tiny
little ads in magazines."  "We're in 85 countries". Write everything
down.</P>

<P>Make no judgments now. You are not looking for an excuse not to join the
program. You are looking for: "What gave me the idea not to do this".
</P>
<P>Review the product list. Cross out everything that's irrelevant. "We're
in 85 countries"; unless you want to set up an additional foreign
language website and answer emails in a foreign language, cross it out.
</P>
<P>Now start over again. While reading the list, visualize yourself doing
each step necessary to operate the new distributorship. Visualize
paying for running the tiny ads supplied by the company. (After you
crossed out the irrelevant hype, do you have any of the ad left?)
Who would you visualize as a potential customer?</P>
<P>
Then turn everything around. Start a separate list. Let's call it the
"benefits list". You've already visualized the potential customer
so think like they do. Does the program offer any real benefit to the
customer?</P>
<P>
Many times that's it: there simply was no real need for this
company to go into business. Where else can I buy this product?
Would I quit my present supplier to do business with this
distributorship?</P>

<P>After you have written the "benefits" list, you can put both lists away
and start on something else. If you happen to think of something on
one of the lists, reread the other list. The answer you are looking for
is a combination of something from list "A" and list "B".</P>

<P>The answer, what the little voice was trying to tell you, will probably
pop into your head sometime in the next day or two. A new
distributorship, even if it's free, costs time and money to promote.
(You did consider promotional costs didn't you?) So it's an
important decision.</P>
<P>
It's easy to see why this is an important thought process to use:
What's the first thing the boss or spouse is going to ask? "What
gave you the idea not to do it?"</P>
