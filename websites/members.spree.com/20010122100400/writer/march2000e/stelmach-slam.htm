<U>CHARACTER VOICES</U>
<P align=justify>
In my last article of this series, I talked about the use of Accents in
both the writing and performance of poetry. The use of Character Voices
is just one more step in the process of creating vocal variety both in
your written and spoke work.
<P align=justify>
<B>Let us begin with the Narrative Voice of your written work</B>, the voice
of the person telling the story as it were, or poem, both on paper and
on the stage. Unusually, the Narrative Voice is your every day voice, or
a slightly altered and perhaps heightened one. In most modern novels
contractions, words like <I> I'm, can't and don't</I>, are not used
for the voice of the Narrator or person telling the story, except when
he is talking in quotation, whereas contractions are almost always used
in the speech of the rest of the cast of characters.  He is often an
observer, a slightly more educated observer or at least someone who has
a great deal of interest in what is going on around him. This
inquisitiveness sets him apart from those being observed.
<P align=justify>
He may be a doctor, a lawyer or a punk off the street. Each Narrator
will speak accordingly using the appropriate jargon or slang for that
voice. A Punk off the street may very use contractions in his speech,
but his voice will be altogether different from that of the other
Characters in his story.
<P align=justify>
In a poem what is being observed may be little more than a flower, an
ant or a tin can. The voice of someone who observes a flower may and
probably should be very different from that which observes a tin can.
And depending upon where the tin can is, whether it be on a supermarket
shelf, under the eye of a hungry cat or in the hands of a bum in a
dumpster the voice talking about the tin can will be very different in
each situation both on paper and in the spoken word. More will be
covered on this topic under Point of View.
<P align=justify>

<B>Your natural speaking voice</B> is probably centered somewhere around the
center of your tongue. To create a slightly different Narrative Voice or
to add a Character Voice to your spoken work repertoire all you need do
is change the pitch or placement of your voice. You do this by placing
it in a different position within your mouth, throat or nasal cavity.
You may speak from the tip of your tongue, from your lips, from the back
of your throat, from down in your boots, as it where, or from up in your
nostrils. Each placement gives a different pitch and sound to your
voice. Once you get used to the process you will also be able to change
the sound and not the pitch or the pitch and not the sound.
<P align=justify>
Listen to the many varieties of English accents, say by a New Yorker, a
Southerner, or an Australian.  In each case, the person talking will be
speaking English, but the English they speak, in most instances, will
vary greatly, and some of these variations can be attributed in part to
placement and/or pitch.  
<P align=justify>
To locate the position from which your natural voice comes, begin by
speaking as you do normally.  Talk out loud as if to a friend.  Listen
carefully while you do.  Feel the vibration.  Feel - using your fingers
touch your cheeks, neck, chin, lips, nose and upper chest - and find
where your voice naturally comes from, where you place your voice while
speaking.  Does it come from just above the tongue, just below it, or
somewhere much higher or lower, or even off the tip of the tongue? 
Wherever you find the point of strongest vibration is where you will
find your natural narrative voice.  Now raise or lower your voice, just
a little.  Make it sound slightly higher or lower in pitch. Two
exercises follow:
<P align=justify>
<U>EXERCISE I:</U> Let us say that your natural voice is slightly high in pitch
and that its placement is somewhere just above the back of the tongue.
Now, try a slightly lower tone, that is speak with a slightly lower
voice.  Think of your voice placement as moving down to just below the
tongue or just into the throat, no farther. Do not strain.  Say
something with this new placement.  Feel the sound of the two
placements, your natural and your newly discovered placement.  Listen to
the difference. Now take your voice a little lower.  Do not take it so
low that it becomes uncomfortable. Never push or strain your voice. Any
vocal exercise, if it is to be done properly, without the danger of
injury to the tissue, must be done in a comfortable relaxed state. 
<P align=justify>
<U>EXERCISE I A VARIATION:</U> Those of you who have a naturally low voice may
try the above exercise by creating a slightly higher tone.  If your
voice is somewhere in the middle, neither high nor low, work on
expanding your vocal range in the direction that feels most comfortable
to you. In further installments you will be shown how to extend your
range to more extreme levels.  For the moment keep things simple.  
<P align=justify>
<U>EXERCISE II:</U> Once you have a good idea where the placement of your new
voice is in relation to your natural voice, try the following.  Say only
those words in quotation:  
<P align=justify>
<pre>
"Hello, how are you?" says your natural voice.  
"I'm just fine, how are you?" says your new voice.        
"By the way, where are you?" says your natural voice. 
"I'm down/up here," says your new voice.       
"Good," says your natural voice.        
"And where are you?" says your new voice.        
"I'm up/down here," says your natural voice.         
</pre>
<P align=justify>
Now you have two voices, your natural narrative voice, and your new
character voice.  Experiment with these two voices by having them talk
one to the other.  Read a book out loud.  Choose a short narrative
section that is interspersed with dialogue, or a play or section of a
play with only two characters speaking.  In either case, alternate
between the two voices.  You could also choose a piece of narration that
is particularly descriptive, switching voices with each new sentence. 
Think of your two voices as two reporters on the evening news filling in
different aspects of the same story.  You may wish to practice this in
private until you feel comfortable sharing your new voice with a
sympathetic listener. 
<P align=justify>
Once you have created one Character Voice you may wish to go on to
create another and another, each dealing with placement and or pitch
change.  A word of caution: when creating and/or using Character Voices
in the delivery of your poetry both on the page and on the stage,
subtlety is very important. A slight change in pitch will do just fine.
Too much exaggeration will create a comic effect. And like any devise,
use it sparingly. Too much salt ruins the broth. As already mentioned
more will be said about this topic under the title of Point of View. For
further study check the suggestions made in the previous article of this
series on Accents.
<P align=justify>
Good luck and enjoy.
