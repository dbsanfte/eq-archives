<P>What are you willing to sacrifice for the dreams in your life?
Yes it will take sacrifices in order to achieve success. The
road to riches is paved with sacrifices!</P>

<P>Do you have the ability to make the choices that lessen
the sacrifices that are sometimes necessary?</P>

<P>Sacrifices include, days and weeks when 16 to 20-hour days
are the norm, when you hardly notice what day of the week it is.
Sometimes days turn into weeks and weeks, months. Some
seasons pass you by without a glance. A blur that passes you
by season after season. That was my old life!</P>

<P>The times and moments of wrestling over whether the goal and
plan are valid enough to continue this sustaining streak. Self-
doubt creeps in and is an ever-bearing thought that has to be
fought back or it will kill your business.</P>

<P>Ongoing pep talks to your inner-self will be required to
Maintain inner-strength and fend off the effects of setbacks
and stinging disappointment, discouragement and occasional
disillusionment. The way in which you bounce back from
the effects of a major setback can sometime be the single
determining factor in achieving success. The battle to keep
from giving up when it gets tough and hard to think.</P>

<P>Financial spending seems to always go over what you had planned
on specific projects or products!  Under funding is one of the first
reasons why start-up businesses fail. A smart business plan will
allow you to not only survive personally and financially but will
have formed a contingency plan to overcome yet another problem.</P>

<P>Physical health is often overlooked and illness often accompanies
you on your road to success - the stress of it all such as weight
loss or gain, fatigue, even depression. Realize that mental and
physical planning is an absolute must to achieve your success.</P>

<P>All too often one of the largest sacrifices of achievement is
irreparable damage to relationships in your life, when that
significant other person reads the actions of focusing and
determination as an obsession. The reality is that true
understanding and support by that person or persons
outside the quest are rare.</P>

<P>A large number of families have fallen apart because the
entrepreneurial spirit was alive in a household without
the others having the same stick-to-it-ivenss. This is
such a complex and normal occurrence that each situation
has it’s own unique but sameness to it. The ability to sit
down prior to starting entrepreneurial ventures and ironing
out exactly what the other person or persons are expecting
and what they can give is the path to preventing relationships
from falling apart. Communication is the key that will see
relationships not only survive, but grow while on the road to
success.</P>

<P>It is so amusing and enlightening when I hear someone
make envious statements of a successful person such as,
"Oh yeah, he's got it so easy". My thought is usually "if
you only knew". Knowing full well they have no idea what
it has taken for that successful person to achieve their success.</P>

<P>The road to success is sometimes paved with steep and rocky
hills with very few valleys in the beginning. The ones who are
 willing to fight the fight and often pay the high price are the
ones that truly enjoy their success and sharing with others.</P>

<P>If you hit those hills, just remember there are valleys going down
as well and you cannot stop and pick up the rocks on the way
upward. Leave them behind for the slothful ones. The climb
will be sooo worth it!</P>

<P>When you get to the top look on the valleys and the rocks with
joy and accomplishment knowing you did it yourself with
sacrifice, planning and work! Most of all take a mentor on your
journey, someone who has what you want and is will to share
the secrets of getting there as it will make the path much less
rocky and shorter! If you can’t find one give me a ring, I am
willing to share my journey with you.</P>
