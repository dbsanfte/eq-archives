	<FONT FACE="Franklin Gothic Book" COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1">
	<P>Bee Pollen is one of my favourites.  I've been taking it for over five years
now and I find that it has helped me tremendously with my allergies and hay
fever.  I live in the country and I don't even remember what it was like to
suffer through the summers!  It is one of my first recommendations when
someone tells me that they suffer from allergies.  Now, Bee Pollen isn't for
everyone.  Statistics show that .02% of the population is allergic to Bee
Pollen.  If you are going to try it, I recommend starting very, very slowly
(as in one granule per day to start, then gradually increasing to about 1/4
tspn once your body has become accustomed to it.)  After that, you can vary
according to your own body size and severity of symptoms.
</P>
<P>Why is Bee Pollen so good for you?  It is known to contain 16 different
vitamins, including B-12, 16 minerals, 21 enzymes and co-enzymes, all 18
amino acids and many other elements.  The protein content of the pollen
varies from 15 to 35%, depending on the floral sources.  It is very potent
(particularly in its granule form) which is why not very much is needed. One
pound of pollen is comparable in its nutritional value to about 15 pounds of
fresh vegetables, salads and fruits.  With respect to its protein content,
it is comparable to 5 pounds of beef (without the fat!)  Essentially, two
flat tablespoons of pollen would cover the daily requirements of a person in
regard to essential proteins (listen up all vegetarians and dieters).
</P>
<P>So, why does it help with allergies and hay fever?  Bee Pollen has been
shown to help strengthen the immune system.  Furthermore, it provides
antioxidant protection that scavenges free radicals.  Allergies are one of
the ways in which the body manifests free radical damage.  Bee Pollen has
also been known to inhibit the release of histamine in the body via
quercetin, contributing to the decrease in allergic and hay fever responses.
</P><P>
Bee Pollen has also been known to consistently and noticeably increase
energy levels, which makes it a favourite among athletes and those
interested in performance enhancement.  It has been used safely by Olympic
athletes for years!</P>

<P>And if that isn't enough, Bee Pollen is known to be one of the world's
oldest youth foods.  According to several respected European and Soviet
gerontologists, Bee Pollen has been shown to rejuvenate the body, stimulate
organs and glands, enhance vitality and promote a longer life span.
</P>
<P>The quality of Bee Pollen is of vital importance.  Poor quality Bee Pollen
will not contain the same amount of nutrients as in a high quality product.
The reasons behind that can be related to the geographic location or flower
species pollens are collected from.  Pollen collected from several or more
flowers contains a broader spectrum of nutrients.  Furthermore, pollens
collected from wildflowers are usually more effective and safer than those
collected from commercial flowers because wildflower roots can bring up more
of the vital trace minerals that are so lacking in our North American diet.
</P>
<P>Any of you that know me out there know that I'm a stickler for quality when
it comes to my supplements.  Not all Bee Pollens are necessarily pure and
clean.  They can only be as clean as the environment in which they exist.
Think about it -- what about flowers within a 10-mile radius of a nuclear
power plant?</P>
<P>
Bee Pollen can be purchased in either a granule or capsule form.  I prefer
the granules because of the potency, but some may prefer the ease of
swallowing a capsule.  I simply drink the granules with some water (my kids
chew them??!!).  Some people sprinkle the granules over their cereal in the
morning.  Whichever way you prefer, it's obvious as to the many, many
benefits derived from the addition of Bee Pollen to the diet.</P>
