	<P>Do you know how to focus?  Really focus? </P>

<P>No?  Well, if you did know how, would it help you remember
people’s names?  Would it stop you from being nervous, or at
least help you control your thoughts so your thoughts don’t
make you nervous?</P> 

<P>YOU BET!</P> 
<P>
How about if you talk too much or too loud?  Would focusing
help you? </P>

<P>YOU BET!</P> 

<P>Would it help you remember where you left something?  Or why
you even walked into that room in the first place? </P>
<P>
YOU BET! </P>

<P>Well, if focusing is such a benefit, why haven’t you learned
how?</P> 

<P>Too many reasons to go into, right?</P> 

<P>Well, you’ve got time to read this now, you might as well
learn while you’re here.  What do you say?  Shall we do it? 
OK!</P> 

<P>Step one:  *Don’t you just love it?  I am so methodical.*
Stand up straight.  Take a deep breath and close your eyes.</P>  

<P>***  Now, some of us aren’t in shape, so maybe we’ll
have to sit down for this.  The rest of you, STAND.  *** </P>

<P>Step two:  Think of all the wonderful things that have
happened in your life. </P> 
<P>
*** Remember, your mind does not know the difference
between real and vividly imagined.  If you don’t have any
wonderful things that have happened to you, imagine the
wonderful things that have happened to a friend or
acquaintance.  *** </P>

<P>Step three:  Imagine what it feels like to experience
something you don’t think you can handle.</P>  

<P>Step four:  Now, imagine yourself succeeding.  Succeeding,
regardless!  How do you stand when you’re feeling that way? 
How do you look?  How do you FEEL? </P>

<P>Step five:  Now, on that feeling of exhilaration, feel the
calm that is also there. Stand or sit straighter and imagine a
golden glow of light in the shape of a funnel on the top of
your head.  Feel that light as it courses through your body.</P> 

<P>Step six:  Take another deep breath.  Now, hold that breath
in.  As you hold your breath in, feel your heart beat. </P> 

<P>Step seven:  With your mind, feel your heart beat in your left
little finger.  *Or if you can’t feel it there, feel it in
your right elbow, or wherever, anywhere else besides your
heart. Remember, whatever works, works.* </P> 

<P>Step eight:  Wait a couple heartbeats or so, then mentally
move your heartbeat from your left little finger *or wherever
you had it* to another place on your body.  Isn’t that fun? 
It’s always nice to stretch your mind, isn’t it?  *Is this the
time to remind you that your mind is like a muscle?  USE IT OR
LOSE IT?  Hm?* </P>
<P>
*** Release the breath whenever you feel the need,
then take another deep breath and hold it while we work some
more.  Do this throughout. *** </P> 

<P>Step nine:  Now, as you take control of your heartbeat, moving
it at will, pick one place you want to be your power place. 
Let’s say it’s your right thumb.  That golden glow of light on
your head is continuous and is flowing down, down through your
arm into that thumb.  Feel the power! </P>

<P>***  Now, if you are at the age where you tend to feel
arthritis in a joint, this may feel like that.  If you don’t
want to encourage that, pick a different place. ***</P> 

<P>Do this daily.  Do it often during the first few days until
you feel your power just by thinking of your power place. 
While your mind is concentrating on your power place, it isn’t
concentrating on anything else, and that’s one of the purposes
of this exercise.  To calm your mind. </P>

<P>End of exercise. </P>

<P>Now, you just learned to focus.  After using this technique
for several days (usually 21) it will become a habit.  Toward
the last few days you will feel a shift in your thinking, and
you will be able to feel the confidence this invokes in your
mind.  Answers will come to you *out of the blue.* </P>

<P>Just think, no one else knows how to do this.  *Hm.  Well, no
one you know, evidently?*  You can startle your friends with
your knowledge, you can impress your spouse, and best of all
*YOU CAN TEACH YOUR KIDS!*  And anyone else if they’re really,
really nice to you.:)) </P>

<P>If you find yourself getting nervous or forgetting things in
the future, check it out.  Were you focusing?  Why not?</P>  

<P>You have knowledge now.  Go forth and feed the nations. </P>
