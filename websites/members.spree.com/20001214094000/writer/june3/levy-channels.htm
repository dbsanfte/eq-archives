<P>	We get a gift of a brand new Magical TV which has unlimited access
to all the 
beautiful channels. When we tune in to any one of the millions of
stations we 
become embraced with wonderful joy filled feelings. We are given a
remote 
control and can instantly connect to all the marvelous programs at
will. 
We are really enjoying switching channels and experiencing lots of
happy days.
Time progresses and the remote control is not working so well. We
can no 
longer get our favorite channels and the ones we can get we really
do not 
care for. A little later even the programs we tolerate start to get
distorted. The signals become weak and there is a lot of
interference. The TV 
has trouble getting enough electric power  as the tube is getting
worn out 
working so hard to connect to even the mediocre stations. The magic
has now 
gone out of the TV set and the tube fades away. The power source
can no 
longer travel inside the set as the receiver has extinguished
itself.</P>

<P>When we are born we receive a brain that is clear and sharp and can
tune into 
all the joy in the universe. It also has the ability to tune into
messages of 
Joy from all it sees, hears, feels, touches and smells. As we grow
and mature 
control of our awareness  mechanism starts to disappear and the joy
of life 
slowly fades away. We search desperately for the way we can turn on
our joy 
but the more effort we put into seeking the joy the more miserable
we become. </P>
 <P>We question ourselves, doubt ourselves and yes even start to hate
ourselves. We might try to blame others for our lost joy but deep
inside we 
know we cannot tune into a really happy life. We find many
substitutes for 
joy like: new cloths, new cars, making tons of money, smoking,
drinking 
alcohol, Drugs. Non switch on our real joy. We have leant to
tolerate a 
lifestyle that we are not so happy with. But what can we do, it is
all most 
of us have. </P>
<P>In order to enjoy the fruits of our labor, we first need to get our
mind in 
order.</P>
<P>We have learned to endure and forgot how to enjoy.</P>

<P>If we realize there is a way to recharge our control of awareness
and it will 
put us in tune with harmony, love, contentment and a true joy of
life, we get 
a second chance.</P>
<P>The receiver in our brains need to switch on to the correct voltage
and allow 
the currents of
intelligent energy to flow through our whole system. As we
re-energize we 
begin to feel real power surges and can tattle any distortion that
comes our 
way. Nothing stops us from receiving a beautiful clear picture of
Health 
Wealth and Happiness. We are programed to Life is Beautiful and we
do not 
need to switch channels any more. </P>

<P>By detaching from the physical world we see around us and attaching
to a 
power source of intelligence that has created and evolved all Life
and Matter 
we find the real way of living as human beings. We now can enjoy
all the 
physical world has to offer and also become a creative link in the
chain of 
evolution. We take pleasure in helping our fellow man and woman to
make their 
life a happy one. We realize that the pure potential of infinite
wisdom is a 
channel that is linked to our minds and we have access when we
clear the way 
to receive it.</P>
<P>We never get sick, never worry and are always contented. </P>
<P>Does it sound like Magic?</P>
<P>Well IT------ IS.</P>
<P>.I. S.---Infinite Silence</P>
<P>In Infinite Silence we connect with GOD.</P>
<P> It is there we recharge our batteries on a daily basis.</P>
<P>When we feel the Divine Bliss this magic energy gives us we want to
soak up 
every ounce.</P>
<P>We find after a while we can connect to this channel day and night.
In a 
crowded room or all alone. We can turn on the power at will. Our
Freewill is 
tuned to God because it gives us Joy not because we are instructed
to by 
Religion. We now know what will power means.</P>
<P>God is directing us, not human Rules & Regulations.</P>
<P>We now can throw away the remote control. We will never feel
remote, alone or 
far away from God. For we are automatically connect 24 hours a day
7 days a 
week 52 weeks a year.</P>
<P> Eventually we will throw away our body and live in eternal divine
bliss.</P>
<P> But not just yet. We have a whole lot of programs to Really ENJOY!</P>
