	<P>December 31, 1984 . . . I am writing in this journal to keep from going mad as
                 my father did. We met on New Year's Eve during the Winter Olympic Games. I
                 was standing near the punch bowl next to Tanja, my best friend in gymnasium.
                 He stood no more than fifteen meters from us. It was the last dance of the night,
                 and I could see him pushing his mother and father together in the middle of the
                 party. His father was laughing, holding his huge middle as if he wanted to suck it
                 in and become a young man again. His mother, on the other hand, was shyly
                 smiling her Serb smile-a brave and understanding smile that I was later to see
                 under much more trying circumstances.</P> 

               <P>  Once he had gotten them to dance, he sauntered over to us, his dark good looks
                 winning me over immediately. We were 16 then-mere children. The only
                 closeness we had was our bodies. Our bodies pulled toward each other in the dim,
                 dance floor light like magnets-like moths toward the flame of passion; each pulling
                 back-then pushing forward-until, at last, he was next to me and staring into my
                 eyes. I can see his deep brown pools in my dreams at night when the snipers
                 begin their foray out in the streets. His confident, strong gaze can encompass my
                 being and momentarily drown out the ravaging bullets ricocheting off our
                 apartment building on Koshevo Hill. It was this way that evening in 1984-when all
                 was peaceful-when we all believed in multiethnic solidarity. Why else would the
                 Olympic Committee have chosen us? We were Sarajevo, the soul of Yugoslavia,
                 where Serb, Muslim, Catholic and Jew lived together in harmony, hosting the
                 world with pride in our chests and welcome in our voices. </P>
<P>
                 He asked to kiss me when the New Year was rung in. I should have known then
                 that the bullets we heard being fired outside in celebration were ominous
                 precursors to later events. As I told my mother just the other day, "Only bullets
                 will stop our love." A New Year's kiss and bullets began our romance. I, Admira
                 Ismic, a Bosnian Muslim, and he, Bosko Brkic, a Bosnian Serb, came together
                 and formed something that united the universe-at least it was that way for us.
                 Love, you see, can travel across distances that war and cruelty can never travel.
                 With the beating of two young hearts, we came together for all the world. And
                 my Bosko-my beloved Bosko--and I were to see just how far our love would take
                 us. </P>
	<hr>
	

                 <P>June, 1986 . . . After we graduated, Bosko's father died suddenly of a heart
                 attack. He was only 45, and my Bosko took his father's death very hard. He told
                 me he was going to join the army and get his compulsory service over with. 
</P>
                 <P>On a warm night in July, I drove with him out to the train station, where he would
                 travel to the Serbian Officer's Candidate School of the Yugoslav Federal Army.
                 We had never been apart. When I kissed him at the station, I felt alone in the
                 middle of the crowds of people. Love can do that to you. You are drained of
                 emotion when your beloved must go. The hands of the clock are ripped from the
                 dial, and you stand with your heart broken, holding the arrows up to the sun. 
</P>
                 <P>I waited every day that summer for a letter. He wrote to me each free moment,
                 and I almost tackled the postman when he arrived with the mail. Sitting in the
                 corner of our house in Sarajevo reading his letters, I remembered the laughter we
                 shared as we watched my cat, Tito, chase a ball of yarn around the room. "My
                 dearest Admira: Every night when I go to bed, I cannot sleep because I'm thinking
                 of you. My love, you are the only happiness I have. Now all my life points to the
                 day when I'll finish my military service and see you again." 
</P><P>
                 I would also read Naka Gruber's letters. She was living in Srebenica. As my
                 grandmother, she was the only one in the family who seemed to sense the disaster
                 that was about to befall us. She remembered the days when the Serbs were
                 nationalists and racists, and she believed these days would return again after the
                 fall of Communism. "Get out of Sarajevo," she wrote to my mother. "Take the
                 kids and go. The old hatreds will return like vultures to the carcass. Get out
                 before it's too late!" </P>

                 <P>Father, who had been in Tito's Pioneers after the Second World War, did not
                 believe what Naka Gruber's letters advised. He believed we were going to remain
                 an example of a successful and modern multiethnic state that would remain
                 independent, even though we had lost the militant protective cloak of
                 Communism.</P> 

                 <P>Bosko and I believed father and a majority of the others in Sarajevo who were,
                 for the most part, cosmopolitans; we had television, we had radio, we had
                 rock-and-roll, American Levis, and computers . . . our lifestyles were not that
                 unlike any of the Western teenagers we had met during the Olympic year of
                 1984. But we did not count on the distance. We are distant from America and
                 from Europe, even though we can see them over our television sets and hear their
                 songs over our radios. </P>

                <P> Bosko and I sang together in the disco when he arrived eleven months later. We
                 sang an American song popular in Sarajevo at the time: "We Are Family," by Sly
                 and the Family Stone. We received American records much later than Europeans
                 did. Bosko gazed into my eyes that night of his return and said, "We will make
                 family! Wait for me, Admira. Will you wait?" </P>

                 <P>Today I am waiting for him to appear. We have permission to soon leave
                 Sarajevo. Celo has negotiated with the Serbs, and we are to finally cross over into
                 Serbian-held territory in Grbavica, beyond the "no-man's-land," over Vrbana
                 Bridge, what we called the Brotherhood and Unity Bridge before the war. But,
                 once again, we did not count on the distance. Men have a difficult time staying
                 out of "no-man's-land," and this was no exception. Bosnians were on one side,
                 Serbs and Chetniks were on the other. And we, Bosko and I, the symbols of
                 multiethnic pride, we were in the middle of their guns.</P> 
	<hr>
	<P>April, 1989 . . . The Oslobodenje Daily reported a speech by Serbian leader,
                 Slobodan Milosevic. He was speaking at the anniversary of an ancient
                 battleground called "the Field of the Blackbirds," where over a half-million Serbs
                 gathered to honor their 14th century war hero, Prince Lazar. This "Prince" had
                 fought the Muslim Turks at the battle of Kosovo in 1389 and his defeat had not
                 been forgotten. Now, a modern militant politician was using this loss to stoke the
                 fires of war with a call to nationalism to re-claim their ancient territory in Bosnia:
                 "It is a coincidence of life and history that Serbia in 1989 is regaining its state and
                 dignity. So in this way, we are celebrating a historic anniversary from the ancient
                 past that has symbolic importance for the future of Serbia. The Muslim menace is
                 raging all over the world once more. Terrorists bomb free airplanes and
                 machine-gun innocent passengers in airports. These are the invaders from within
                 that we must conquer-or they will conquer us!" </P>

           <P>      This Serbian threat led to a declaration of independence in Croatia in 1991. When
                 war broke out, Naka Gruber's home was gutted and burned to the ground. Both
                 the Serbs and Croats turned their greedy eyes toward Bosnia and, of course,
                 toward us. But my Bosko was a special kind of Serb-he was to marry me, the
                 ancient enemy, the Muslim invader, or what the Serb Nationalist Chetniks liked to
                 call us: the blackasses. </P>

	
	<hr>
	<P>April 5, 1992 . . . Many times during the week I would travel the five miles
                 between our houses, a distance that I traveled quickly on my Triumph
                 motorcycle. Bosko and his mother lived in a large apartment on Koshevo Hill. I
                 knew the way like I knew the face of my beloved. Bosko was always telling me I
                 was too wild for a woman. I liked to speed on my bike, work on cars, and I can
                 even shoot a rifle. Bosko, on the other hand, is a cool character, often reflective
                 and philosophical. He balances me well.</P> 
<P>
                 On this day, I was traveling on my cycle to Bosko's apartment, but the streets
                 were unusually active. I saw hundreds of my fellow citizens: Serbs, Croats,
                 Muslims, and they were all demonstrating their support for a new, independent,
                 and multi-ethnic state. Oslobodenje had written long editorials in support of racial
                 and political harmony, and the people were responding by carrying banners and
                 newly constructed Bosnian flags. But they were also reacting to the gathering
                 clouds of violence in Serbia and Croatia that were forming all around us.</P> 

                <P> As I was walking my bike down Marshall Tito Avenue I heard the shots. They
                 sounded like firecrackers, but when people began running and screaming, I knew
                 something horrible had taken place. People ran past me, pulling their children,
                 covering their heads, yelling and screaming curses into the morning air. I stopped
                 one old woman and asked what the commotion was. "Those bastard
                 Chetniks-they're shooting into the crowd!" she screamed. </P>

               <P>  The distance between me and my lover became much longer in the coming
                 weeks. For the siege on Sarajevo had begun. </P>
	<hr>
	

                <P> July 4, 1992 . . . The shelling had almost leveled the city. Each day, dozens of
                 men left us to join the Federal Army and attack us. We could not understand how
                 men could forget the 500 years of peaceful relations to become terrorists in the
                 hills, shooting down mortars and artillery shells to massacre their brothers and
                 sisters.</P> 

               <P>  Bosko was more reflective about the problem. His parents were college educated
                 and so was he. I loved him more at such times. He gave me the wisdom to get
                 through the days of terror, when at any moment your life could be snuffed out
                 like a candle flame. "Violence is easier to many because it is hard work to earn
                 your way in this world. Bullets and bombs are fast, direct and immediate. With
                 violence, one does not have to argue and get disagreements out into the open to
                 be fairly resolved. When you kill the opposition, no one is left to argue with you.
                 Albert Camus knew this when he wrote his famous essay 'Neither Victims or
                 Executioners.' I have known many men whose only answer to problems in life
                 was to take a violent course of action. I do not believe violence resolves the root
                 of the problem." Bosko spoke like this whenever he become philosophical.</P> 

                 <P>Misa Cuk was living with Bosko and his mother. The older Serb neighbor had
                 already sent his Muslim wife and children out of Sarajevo, and he had joined the
                 Bosnian defense forces. Each day, he would argue with Bosko and try to get him
                 to join. "Take this gun, he would say," handing an AK-47 to my Bosko, "because
                 if somebody comes for you and it's time to die, at least you can protect yourself."
                 But Bosko refused the gun. He said he picked it up with the tips of his fingers, as
                 one picks up a handkerchief. "Misa, my friend. I am in the middle. I cannot go
                 into the Muslim army to shoot Serbs. They are my people. And I cannot join the
                 Serbs to shoot down on Sarajevo. My Admira and her folks are here. You have
                 sent your loved ones away so you can be free to kill. I do not have that fortunate
                 circumstance." Many people said there was a bounty being given by the Germans
                 of 500 marks for every Sarajevan killed. Some said the Germans were trying to
                 practice their old ways of ethnic cleansing, so they were supporting Milosevic and
                 his Serb nationalists as they began their extermination campaign. Needless to say,
                 it was dangerous to go out into the streets. But we had no electricity in much of
                 the city, and water had become scarce, not to mention the shortages of food and
                 clothing. </P>

             <P>    One day, my mother came into the apartment with a bag of something. Each day
                 was an adventure out in the streets because snipers were always out there ready
                 to silently kill you as you stand in line for water or for bread. Mother poured the
                 contents onto the kitchen table and stood back to admire them. Right there on our
                 dining table were about a dozen old bras! That's right, my mother had finally gone
                 totally delirious, and this was her complete mental breakdown. "Mother, have you
                 lost your senses? What the hell are these?"</P>

                 <P>"Celo got these from the Serbs," she said, "German women are getting coupons
                 worth 50 marks if they donate their used bras for women in Sarajevo. Isn't that
                 kind of them? They understand we must maintain our modesty in these trying
                 days."</P> 

                <P> "Nera," (I call my mother by her first name only at times of extreme distance
                 between our generations) "we cannot wear these putrid garments!" I picked one
                 up and held it as Bosko will hold a gun. "We have lost six of our relatives in this
                 war, and you want to accept used bras from the very power that supports the
                 extermination of your family? Where is the food? Where are the medicines?
                 Where is the United Nations? All we get are bras. If we had oil like Kuwait, I
                 guess we could get the whole American army! Wait, let me try and call those
                 Americans." I picked up one of the huge, German bras and carried it over to the
                 window as if I were carrying a dead cat. </P>

                <P> "Admira! What are you doing?" my mother admonished me.</P>

                <P> I began to wave the bra around as if it were a flag of surrender. "Hey, big boys!
                 Come and get it!" And I sang an old American song from the 1950s, "Come onna
                 my house, come on, come on! I'm gonna give you ever-y-thing!"</P>

                <P> Bosko and I laughed until we had tears, picturing the look on my mother's face as
                 I waved that old German bra. In a strange way, it was our flag of surrender.</P> 
	
	<hr>
	<P>Today, May 19, 1993 . . . Before we surrendered, we were married. Misa Cuk
                 drove us to the wedding in central Sarajevo. I had moved into Bosko's apartment
                 with him and his mother, Rada. The distance to the Hall of Workers in downtown
                 Sarajevo is about six miles. It was going to be relatively safe because Celo Akim
                 was also going to be wed.</P>
<P>
                 Celo is a friend who had earlier taken Bosko under his dark wing. When Celo was
                 17, the tough Muslim was arrested for armed robbery and rape and sent to a
                 maximum security prison. While in prison, Celo made an important connection
                 when he protected a frail political prisoner by the name of Alia Izetbegovic, who
                 would later become the president of Bosnia. After six years in prison, Celo
                 returned to the streets a hardened criminal and gang leader. His group, the
                 "Ministers of Justice," controlled much of Sarajevo's drug and protection rackets.
                 But Rada Brkic, Bosko's mother, would always find time to take Celo in and
                 nurse his wounds, feed him, and attempt to get him to go straight.</P> 

                 <P>But when the Serbian attacks began in 1992, Celo formed the first armed
                 resistance to defend his city. He used his criminal connections and sly manner to
                 protect the less devious citizens like his childhood friend, Bosko Brkic. Celo's
                 protection and his connections to the exchanges of civilians and prisoners of war
                 were invaluable to us. In a civil war, the distance between hero and criminal
                 becomes much closer together.</P> 

               <P>  Once again, as we kissed, there were bullets surrounding us. This time, however,
                 we were getting married in the center of our beloved city, and all of us were
                 expecting a mortar round or artillery shell to come crashing down on our
                 celebration. It was quite a lavish affair. Bosnian military generals, cabinet
                 ministers and even Celo's prison friend, President Izetbegovic, were all there to
                 stand in the center of the armed guards and machine-gun nests, and toast
                 champagne to the newlyweds. Celo called us "the good and the bad couples,"
                 because he would often get drunk and tell Bosko that he, Bosko, was the one
                 with all the courage. "This war makes heroes of men like me because we have
                 nothing to lose," Celo would say, draping his dark arm around Bosko's shoulders.
                 "You, however, are an educated man. You show us the way of peace, and yet we
                 still fight on. I must protect you and the president because of your wisdom. I
                 must die, if need be, but I will protect you!" </P>

               <P>  Bosko's mother came to Celo in secret one night in August, 1992, after her son
                 was nearly killed by an artillery shell that landed in their apartment's kitchen.
                 Misa, Bosko's older friend, had fled Sarajevo with his gun, a two-way radio and
                 secret military codes from his unit in the Bosnian army. Misa had deserted the
                 military and was now with his wife and children in Serbia. Many of the local
                 toughs were making it hard on Bosko because of his friend's actions. Celo had to
                 intercede to physically protect him on many occasions.</P> 

               <P>  For a momentary diversion, Bosko and a young friend were watching a tennis
                 match on television in Bosko's apartment on Koshevo Hill, and they had just left
                 the kitchen when the shell struck. Shrapnel was everywhere, and they would have
                 surely been killed. But when Rada saw the damage, she decided to go to Celo.</P> 
<P>
                 Bosko's older brother, Bane, was now living in Serbia, and he had grown up with
                 Celo. Rada went to Celo's field headquarters on August 23, 1992 and begged him
                 to help her. Celo agreed. He promised to get an exchange for her and two other
                 Serbs for three Muslim prisoners of war. He also promised to protect Bosko and
                 me and to send us later on. The next evening, Rada made it across
                 "no-man's-land" successfully. It was during some of the heaviest shelling of the
                 war, and we considered it a miracle.</P>

                 <P>However, the Serb program of "ethnic cleansing" had begun that summer all over
                 Bosnia. My fellow Muslims were rounded up and placed in Nazi-like
                 concentration camps where they were executed. The newspaper, Oslobodenje,
                 which was now working inside the bombed-out basement of the once-noble Tito
                 Building, reported that over 200,000 Muslims-mostly civilians--had been
                 slaughtered.</P> 

               <P>  The distance between the killers and ourselves was getting shorter. We moved
                 into the shell of an apartment in early May, 1993. We would sit up at night and
                 watch my cat, Tito, as he would play in the rubble of our room. I held Bosko so
                 tightly then. I was very afraid. He whispered to me, "It won't be long, love. Celo
                 will get us out of here. It is only a matter of days."</P> 

                <P> Those days were clouded with violence. Once, as I was going downtown to get
                 water, a mortar shell hit a group of people standing in a bread line near Kosevo
                 Hospital. The blood from their mangled bodies was sprayed all over me. Until
                 that moment, I had actually believed I was indestructible. But the screams and the
                 vision of staggering people moaning and holding their intestines inside their bodies
                 were experiences that made the distance between you and death instantly closer. I
                 held Bosko all that night, but I secretly cried for my own life. </P>

                 <P>The pressure increased in those days in May 1993, leading us to today. In early
                 May, Bosko received a summons ordering him to appear for questioning by the
                 Muslim police. Misa Cuk had been known as the "Commander of Koshevo Hill,"
                 and Bosko believed they wanted to kill him, Bosko, as they had once killed his
                 grandfather during World War II. </P>

               <P>  We had to leave. This morning, as I stood in the kitchen with my mother, she
                 gave one last appeal for me to stay. I told her, "Mum, do you know what you are
                 asking me? I can't do anything else but go with Bosko. Go back to the past, about
                 30 years ago. Would you have gone with Father?" She finally admitted that she,
                 too, would have left to be with her husband, no matter what the dangers were,
                 just as she was staying with him now, despite his mental peculiarities.</P> 

                <P> My father, the mechanic Zijo, did not say anything to me. He refused to see what
                 was happening all around him. He was living in the past. He refused to see any
                 distance between his Communist paradise and his living horror. He ranted and
                 raved all around the apartment, constructing candles out of old wax and holding
                 them up to us as though he had invented the electric light bulb. "Marshall Tito is
                 coming!" he shouted. "Just wait, you'll see. He will not let us die!" Father was
                 another kind of victim of our war. </P>

                <P> This morning, I wrote a note and left it for my mother to read. It says: "My dear
                 Mum: It seems we are finally leaving tonight and whatever happens is God's will.
                 I'll call you as soon as we are safely on the other side. I most worry about you
                 and father and my little cat. Please talk to him and sleep with him at least once a
                 week. And don't take any more bags of bras, please! Bosko and I have been
                 talking about when the war is over, and we will come back to Sarajevo.
                 Everything will be fine, just like this war never happened. Do not worry about
                 me. Think about yourself. It will be much easier for me this way. I love you so
                 much. Your Admira." </P>

                <P> Bosko stands against the side of the headquarters' wall pulling at the front of his
                 Adidas tee-shirt. He looks nervous. His dark eyes pan the room and finally focus
                 upon his childhood friend, Celo, the Bosnian hero and criminal. "Celo, are you
                 certain they have accepted the terms? We will be able to pass in peace?" </P>

                <P> Celo turns from the radio and grins his best dark, Muslim grin. "Sure, pal, I get
                 hundreds across every month. Didn't your mother and your brother get across
                 without a scratch?"</P> 

                 <P>Bosko looks worried. "Yes, but I have a bad reputation. They think I was
                 working with a deserter, Misa Cuk. Did you tell them I am not a traitor?" </P>

                 <P>Celo looks down at his polished shoes. He is wearing new clothes these days. The
                 civil war is doing more for him than his peacetime gang activities had done. He
                 suddenly looks up and his face turns serious. "Look. Things are getting out of
                 hand. There are five different factions out there, and they all want blood. Shatzo's
                 police, special forces from the Chetniks, HVO, shit man, I ain't Jesus Christ you
                 know! You religious types! You're always wanting a guarantee-if you die there
                 must be heaven-if you live there must be peace. Well, little man, in war there are
                 no guarantees. War means you have to face reality. And the reality of war is life
                 or death."</P> 

                <P> I decide to speak up for my husband even though Muslim women are expected to
                 stay out of men's affairs. "But your war means life has little meaning. It means
                 lowlifes like you get to be in charge because they can kill the fastest and with the
                 least care for the victims. Bosko does not fight because he cares for both sides.
                 Don't you understand? It is the killing itself that he hates. To him, there is no
                 objective distancing of himself so that he can profit from the death all around him.
                 It is only types like you who make out. You can separate yourself from everyone
                 because you think you are superior. Bosko does not think this. He thinks we are
                 all valuable." </P>

               <P>  Celo looks over at me and spits on the floor. "Yeah, well, I have protected his
                 white ass many times. Sure, he's got an education. I know he'll be on top again
                 once this thing's over. But now I'm in charge! If you want to live, then you have
                 to listen to me. You will leave here at five PM just like they all do. They are no
                 different. I make the deals-do you hear me? Without me, nobody would get out
                 of this hell hole alive! So, when the time comes, just get your asses out there and
                 walk to freedom! But remember. I will still be here to take all the shit!" </P>

                <P> It is now five minutes before five. I am holding Bosko's hand. We carry our
                 Adidas sports bags. I did not bring any cosmetics or even clean underwear. Bosko
                 tells me his mother and brother will give us all new things when we reach Serbia.
                 A grim calm surrounds us both as we step out onto the soil of Sarajevo. We can
                 feel the crunch of earth as we step, and Bosko tightens his grip on my hand.
                 There is no distance between us because we are the symbols of a new Sarajevo,
                 the union of Muslim and Serb without the terror, without the constant fear. As we
                 walk along the Miljacka River in no-man's-land, visible to both sides, I feel like I
                 am a living memorial to something they can never kill. A life with no distance, a
                 life with no boundaries between humans, a life where we can all live in peace. I
                 pull at Bosko's hand. I want him to skip with me and sing. After all, it is
                 springtime, and the flowers along the banks of the river leading to the
                 Brotherhood and Unity Bridge are in full bloom. </P>

               <P>  I stop writing in this journal, and I will toss it aside. I do not need to keep a record
                 now. We are free. Time and the memory of time does not exist for those who are
                 in love. We will sing and skip together, and our voices, I expect, will carry to
                 them as they hold tightly onto their weapons and look down on us out here in
                 no-man's-land. "We are family!"</P>
<hr>
<P>Epilogue . . . They walked about 1,000 yards before the sniper bullets hit them.
                 Admira is wearing a dark skirt covering the soft curves of her young body, and
                 beneath her blouse she is wearing a German bra. Bosko is in jeans-what
                 else?--and they both wear sneakers. Admira is embracing the body of her young
                 husband because he died first and she had been wounded, living just long
                 enough to crawl over to his lifeless body that was bleeding into the spring
                 grass. They were born in the late 1960s when the world was painfully trying to
                 come together. They died in the early 1990s, when the world ignored a city in
                 Yugoslavia called Sarajevo, the soul of the republic. Their bodies lay in
                 no-man's-land for eight days because each side was arguing over who would
                 retrieve them. The Serbs say they ran out and gathered the two youths' bodies
                 and carried them back to the bunker. Muslim prisoners of the Serbs say they
                 were tethered by ropes and dispatched to fetch the decomposing corpses. Nera
                 visited the site where her daughter died, accompanied by Italian U. N. soldiers.
                 "It was difficult," she said. "The soldiers had to help me lay some flowers as
                 there were still mines all around. But they knew all about the story once I
                 explained. They said my daughter and her husband were being called the
                 Romeo and Juliet of Sarajevo." </P>
