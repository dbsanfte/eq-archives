	<b>
	<P>According to Bill Gates there are 3 keys to success in any new
venture:</P>
<P>1)  Being in the right place at the right time! (You could well be
already
there!)</P>
<P>2)  Have a vision of where the industry/business you€  ’²re
working in  is going!</P>
<P>3)  Taking Massive and Immediate Action!  (Well?  It is time to
act!)
</P>
<P>"The future belongs to those who believe in the quality of
their dreams."</P>
<P>Was it Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe, the famous German poet and
philosopher
who said those wise words?</P>





<P>Here are my 15 steps to fulfilling my wildest dreams....
</P>
<U><P>1. KNOW YOURSELF</P></U>
<P>Know and accept your weaknesses and  faults (we all have them),
but even
more so your strengths, abilities and gifts.  Build on your
strengths and
try to minimise or improve on your weaknesses; however work more on
your
strengths. An honest objective analysis of yourself is the first
step in
preparing you for success and realising your dreams. Celebrate you
for just
being you, a unique creation.</P>

<P> Aim for mental clarity about what you most want out of life. Think
about
it and write it down.  If it’s happiness, what do you mean by
happiness: a
sense of belonging, recognition, independence, love,  money or
security? If
you don’t know where you are  and where you want to go with
your life, how
will you ever get there? Aim at nothing and you’re sure to hit
it.</P>

<P><U>2. GET PASSIONATE</U></P>
<P>* and don’t apologise for getting passionate.</P>
<P>* What excites you the most? If you are not enthusiastic and
excited about what you’re doing, your path in life, you’ll never get
others to share your dream. Once you find your passion, you will have found your POWER,
MEANINGand PURPOSE in life.</P>


<P><U>3. SURROUND YOURSELF WITH POSITIVE PASSIONATE PEOPLE</U></P>
<P>Always be aware...</P>
<P>* Negative people will poison your dream faster than anything
else..</P>
<P>* Motto: "If you can’t be positive, shut up!"</P>
 <P>Try and stay positive... even in the face of negativity.</P>


4.<P> <U>ACCEPT FROM THE START THAT YOU WON’T PLEASE EVERYONE</U></P>
<P>* You’re going to be misunderstood, misquoted, hurt some
feelings, perhaps
even lose some friends (for the time being).</P>
<P>* Motto: "What other people think of me is none of my
business!"
Repeat this statement to yourself, especially when you doubt or
feel
discouraged - you will be many times.</P>


<P><U>5. ALWAYS BE YOURSELF</U></P>
<P>"To thine own self be true."  (Shakespears "Hamlet", act I.3.).
This is supremely important, no matter
what the world may think of you. The masses are conditioned to
mediocrity and other people’s success can make them not feel so good about
their own insignificant little lives the "tall poppy syndrome", so
prevalent here in New Zealand and in Australia).</P>
<P>Accept yourself.</P>
<P>* Learn from others - but don’t be intimidated by them, or
pretend to be someone you’re not; because...</P>
<P>"We are most effective when we’re being ourselves."</P>

<P><U>6. DON’T BE SCARED OF MAKING MISTAKES</U></P>
<P>*  The only real mistake is one from which you learn nothing.</P>
<P>* Motto:"Far better to try something and fail - than  try
nothing and
succeed!"</P>

<P><U>7. ACCEPT THAT IT WILL NEVER BE  EASY</U></P>
<P>* Realising your dream may be the hardest, most uphill thing
you’ll ever do.</P>
<P>A truth..."You can’t coast uphill."</P>
<P>If you truly believe in what you’re doing (or trying to do),
the value of your product or service  and that it will ultimately HELP others,
the key ingredient in success is never giving up.  "Keep on keeping
on" with your quest.</P>
<P>It has been said that "success is 99% made up of failures".</P>

<P><U>8. TRY AND STAY HUMBLE</U> (no matter how successful you may eventually
be)</P>
<P>* Don’t ever think you’ve made it and arrived- 
there’s always lots up ahead, more to do, higher mountains to climb.</P>
<P>* Motto: "The greatest way to do our thing has yet to be
discovered!"</P>

<P><U>9. DON’T UNDERESTIMATE YOURSELF - OR GOD </U>(INFINITE
INTELLIGENCE, THE UNIVERSE, OR WHATEVER ELSE YOU CALL THE GREAT CREATOR)</P>. <P>There is
incredible
power in yourself (in the form of the unique human mind), but far
more so
in the forces of the Universe. Make them work for you by living
your life
in harmony with these natural forces. Like positive energy attracts
like.</P>
<P>
* Avoid having a minority complex (Who am I, a "nothing") or be filled
with feelings of self pity ("nobody likes me"), or think
"I can’t do it," which will steal your dream.</P>

<P>You are special and unique- a "child of the Universe, of
God."</P>
<P>Be aware:</P>
<P>* Size isn’t everything (except to us men)!</P>

<P><U>10. HAVE FUN (for goodness sake!).</U></P> 
<P>* Nothing is ever as bad as it seems - don’t get too solemn,
or serious or
too downcast when things go wrong (as they surely will from time to
time).</P> 
<P>* Take a leaf from Thomas Edison’s book: "I never did a
day’s work in my
entire life:
it was all FUN!"</P>
<P>Laugh at life’s funny moments... and there are plenty of them.</P>

<P>The secret of happiness is not doing what one likes, but in liking
what one
does. -
 J.M. Barrie</P>

<P><U>11. DEVELOP "THE WILL TO LIVE"</U></P>
<P>* because there will be plenty of times when you’ll face the
death of your dream.</P>
<P>* When failures, disappointments, criticisms come, you need the
will and
faith for better 
days to keep going.</P>
<P>Remember: We learn far more from our failures than our successes,
because
failures show us what doesn’t work. So failure is just one step
closer to
ultimate success. Often the difference between failure and success
is
trying just one more time, picking yourself up off the canvas after
being
knocked down time and again.</P>


<P><U>12. DEVELOP "THE WILL TO HELP AND SERVE OTHERS"</U></P>
<P>* Success on its own (ie. for its own sake) will pollute and
corrupt you - it’s a dead end street unless you have meaning in your life.</P>
<P>The years of
struggle breed fortitude and character. The gold may be an inch
away from
the seam, where your fellow miners have given up.</P>

<P>* You need to succeed for a reason,  a purpose, a cause that’s
bigger than
you!</P>
<P>
and IF (a very big if) you’ve fulfilled all the above
"requirements", </P>
<P>lucky thirteen...</P>


<P><U>13. ALWAYS BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR OPPORTUNITIES.</U></P> They are all around
you.
<P>There are no permanent problems- only solutions, possibilities and
opportunities. The Chinese word for "crisis" means
danger + opportunity.
</P>
<P>
14. <U>If you truly believe in what you are doing,
 DEVELOP THE "WILL TO SUCCEED" with absolute commitment.</U></P>
<P>* it is not enough to just survive - aim at being the best you can
possibly
be!</P>
<P>* keep your dream big, bold and even outrageous -
don’t water it down or
settle for mediocrity... even if others think you are crazy!
Trust in your judgement, your intuition and your creative mind to
overcome
any obstacles (and you’re sure to come across them).</P>
<P>
"Be bold and mighty unseen forces come to your aid."</P>

<P>Always remember....<BR>
"What is impossible with man is possible with God....
so put your trust in the Creator and aim for the heavens, even the
stars."</p>

<P>and finally,</P>

<P><U>15. NEVER GIVE UP ON YOUR DREAM!</U></P>

<P>* Be patient. Don’t be in too much of a hurry to achieve your
goals and
dreams.</P>
<P>* be persistent and never quit.  "Keep on keeping on." As
the saying goes,  "Winners never quit and quitters never win."</P>

<P>Have faith: firstly in your self, your abilities and then in a
Higher
Power, the Creator who wants good for you to fulfil yourself
through your
gifts and abilities to help others and in your own special way to
make a
better world.</P>
<P>Always remember, when you’ve exhausted all your
possibilities, remember you haven’t - there’s always another way, a better
way... and even more importantly, always another day!</P>

<P>Life is not a dress rehearsal, it’s the main event.</P>

<P>GO FOR THAT DREAM.  It is within you and within your reach.</P>






<P>"Whatever the human mind can conceive and believe can be
achieved."  Napolean Hill</p>
<P>"Whatever you do or want to do, the hardest thing to do is to
begin,
so make a beginning."

-JW Goethe</P>

<P>Craig Lock has studied and written extensively on the subject of
personal
success and how to live your dreams.  To date he has had five books
published and numerous others are being published on the Internet.
HANDBOOK
TO SURVIVE THE NINETIES (AND THE NEW CENTURY) and STEPS TO SUCCESS,
PROSPERITY AND HAPPINESS are two of his books on this vast subject.
</P>

<P>"HANDBOOK TO SURVIVE THE NINETIES  AND THE NEW CENTURY
A collection of writings on various subjects to help every man or
woman
survive in a rapidly changing, uncertain world.
HANDBOOK is written in a simple style to help the
"everyperson make the most of themselves and their lives
easier.
 It takes an introductory look at what motivates us and how to set
goals... 
to find our true purpose for being on this planet. 
Also how to handle the stresses life throws at us. I found it
very helpful for my own life.
