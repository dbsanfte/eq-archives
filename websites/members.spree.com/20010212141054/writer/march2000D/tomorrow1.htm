<P align=justify>
Using Phil's advanced navigation skills we quickly located the restaurant. It was next to the beach, in a semi circular building with a large raised terrace at the front. A group of tables had been reserved for our party in the middle of the restaurant. We were late and most of the seats were already occupied. I sat at the first free place I could find, on the end of a table next to a cheerful lady who I knew by sight, but had not yet spoken to. I introduced myself to Pam. 
<P align=justify>
I was having a bad pill day, and with my usual perfect timing, I had become very twitchy, just as it was time to eat, and to make matters worse, it was a buffet! I was dreading the thought of having to serve myself. Pam, must have read my thoughts, and, just like that, asked me if I would like her to get some lunch for me. 'What would you like me to get you?', she said 'a bit of everything?'. 
<P align=justify>
After lunch I went for a walk on my own. I had been to Nuweiba, twenty years ago when I had slept in the sand dunes at the far end of the beach with the rest of the travelers, hippies and beach bums. It hadn't changed much. Palm trees rustled in the late afternoon breeze, and ahead of me a lone radio mast stretched above the distant sand dunes, in a Lawrence of Arabia sort of a way. There were ghosts every where I looked.
<P align=justify> 
I hired a snorkel and swam out to the coral reef. A strong tide soon brought me back to reality, and I had to fight my way back to the shore. 
<P align=justify>
That evening, we received our first briefing from Gideon and the two Israeli guides Hiam and Tao, who had joined us at the boarder crossing. We were told that to avoid dehydrating in the hot desert sun, we should aim to drink up to a litre of water an hour. This was something that was continually drummed into us over the next five days. Fortunately, the nearest anyone got to dehydrating, was from the morning after effects of alcohol - apparently the instruction to drink up to a litre an hour hadn't  applied to beer! Hiam then talked us through the first day of the walk, starting with the words: 'tomorrow will be an easy day'. We were about to find out that this in fact meant the exact opposite! 
<P align=justify>Later that evening I sat outside my bungalow in the cool night air, cuddling up with a glass of duty free whisky and reflecting on the last twenty four hours. I tapped away on my Psion pouring out the emotion of the day:<BR><P align=justify><I>
'It's now evening and I'm sitting outside the room twitching. Emotionally It has been a hard day, with several ups and downs. I'm all at sixes and sevens with my medication, the problem is that its Sunday, and I haven't slept since Friday night, and that was probably only for four hours.
<BR>
<P align=justify>The lowest point without a doubt was the crossing at Taba.  I was having a bad off cycle just as we hit the border and finding it dificult to walk. To make matters  worse I had lost the rubber tip on my stick. I could kick myself now for not brining a spare one, but once we are in the desert it shouldn't matter any more. Anyway, I had to carry my rucksack, day sack, stick - which I couldn't use on the slippery tiled floors without the rubber tip - and camera; through doors, narrow corridors, and crowded immigration  buildings, while at the same time waving my passport and other travel documents, as I tried to negotiate the pantomime farce of Egyptian official dome. A difficult enough job for the fully fit - a bloody nightmare for someone with  Parkinson's. But what really bugged me was/is the attitude of the two Scope organizers, Kate and Sara. Not once have they really asked me how I was getting on, or offered to help me. When we went through the border at Taba, I went through with them and the tour guide Gideon. They all ignored me, joking amongst themselves, basically leaving me to my own devices. The one exception is the photographer Nick, who has been great. I have to say that as a charity for the physically disabled, they are crap at dealing with someone who is disabled. But the high, in all of this, and what has kept me going, has been the other walkers, especially the women, who have been great. It is now 10.15pm I'm not twitchy any more. I'm exhausted, getting bitten by mosquitoes, in spite of spraying my self with insect repellent; but the whisky tastes nice. I really must go to bed and ponder on an action packed 24 hours. Can't wait until tomorrow when the walking starts, I'll show them. Just spotted Gideon going to bed, so it must be time. I can hear the girls returning from the disco. Time for bed.'</i>
<P align=justify>
It feels very strange months later reading what I wrote that night. I sounded like an angry young man, well all right then, an angry middle aged man; and no Kate, Sara and Gideon really weren't that bad. Looking back on it now, I realize that if I couldn't have made the border crossing unassisted, then how the hell was I going to manage the walk. If I had really needed help, then all I had to do was ask, and they would have bent over backwards for me - I was just too stubborn. 
<P align=justify>I woke up at four thirty the next morning, a pattern that would repeat itself for the rest of the trip, and one that I would find hard to break afterwards. It was just starting to get light. I couldn't get back to sleep, and so I decided to get up and go for a swim. I tip-toed out of the bungalow, trying not to wake Phil up, and stepped straight into that mystical crack between night and day. Time stood still - I didn't, and walked down to the beach. The sun was peeking over the distant Saudi Arabian Mountains and looked surprised to see me. I waded out into the sea, took a deep breath and then dived under the water. It was cold, but boy was it refreshing. I swam parallel to the beach for ten minutes, then got out. I had to keep pinching myself. I couldn't believe I was really in Nuweiba again after all those years. I kept thinking that it was a dream, and that at any moment the alarm clock would ring and I would wake up. 
<P align=justify>
After an early breakfast we all assembled in our new Scope T-shirts, squeaky clean kit and happy shiny faces for the regulation group photo, before boarding a bus for the short drive to our starting point.
<P align=justify> On the bus Kate handed out headbands that had been donated by a sports company. These weren't just any old headbands though. Oh no, there was only the best for us: these headbands contained silicon crystals to stay cool and moist. I put my headband on. It felt like I had a box of wet wipes strapped to my forehead.

<P align=justify>
The bus arrived with a clicking of indicators, and I stepped out into what looked like the set from Lawrence of Arabia. There was a rush hour mob of Bedouins; the Egyptian support crew, in their shiny shell suits; and walkers applying sun tan lotion, like actresses adjusting their makeup before the big scene - 'Oh darling you look wonderful'. Shouts of  'everyone in the Blue team over here please, Red team over there'. We gravitated towards our guides like iron filings to a magnet.
<P align=justify>
I had been assigned to the red team with Hiam as our guide. Hiam was a big bear hug of a man. An atheist, who carried a large, well thumbed, bible in his day-sack, from which he would produce passages, like a magician pulling rabbits out a hat. A twinkle in his eyes was constantly playing hide and seek with a shy, serious man, and usually won. He had spent over thirty years in the Sinai, a lot of it I suspect with the Army, and had a formidable knowledge about the place, bordering on the obsessive. A couple of years ago he had fallen down a wadi and smashed his leg quite badly and consequently wore a specially made orthopedic boot on his left foot, and walked with a slow deliberate pace, which suited me just fine. 
<P align=justify>
The blue team had Tao as their guide. Tao was the young pretender, and you sensed that there was a bit of tension between him and Hiam. Tao was all testosterone, muscle and sand and set a blistering pace for his team to follow.
<P align=justify>
 For the first part of the walk, the two teams were taking slightly different routes and meeting up again at an Oasis for lunch. The blue team left first, and while we were getting ready I was introduced, by a worried looking Gideon, to Sameh, our resident GP for the week. (Sameh as it turned out was more than just a Doctor: he had originally qualified as a plastic surgeon but, as he explained to me, because there was not much call for cosmetic surgery in Egypt, he was now teaching Pathology at Cairo University.)
<P align=justify>
I talked Sameh through my condition, and the medication I was on. 'I have Parkinson's disease' I heard myself saying, 'it manifests itself in two ways: without the medication I stiffen up and lose my motor function. The medication corrects this, but I often get quite severe involuntary movements as a side effect.' Sameh seemed surprised at the number of pills I was taking (up to 12 a day) - When I think about it I'm surprised - I positively rattled!  I was on an off cycle at the time, waiting for the previous dose of dopamine to take effect, and was having a bit of a problem walking. Gideon and Sameh were looking concerned. 'Don't worry' I said, 'I'll be fine once I get going'. They didn't look very convinced. 
<P align=justify>
Lights, cameras, action and at last we were off.
<P align=justify>
We started slowly, stopping frequently for Hiam to explain about the geology of the region. I walked along at the back with Sameh, who looked very dapper in his Churchill brogues and Pringle jumper. He told me that he had stepped in at the last minute for a friend. I don't know what his friend had told him, but I expect it was something like 'would you mind accompanying a group of English people on a tour of the Sinai, all expenses paid, it will be a nice little break for you'. He had obviously neglected to mention that it was in fact a hundred-kilometer sponsored hike; and here he was two days latter trekking across the desert with a group of mad English people. But in spite of being completely unprepared for the walk, Sameh seemed to thoroughly enjoy himself. Mind you his brogues looked a little worst for wear at the end of the five days, and I'm not sure what happened to the Pringle jumper. 
<P align=justify>
We made our last stop of the morning by some withered acacia trees, where the advance party had set up a water stop. Hiam explained that it was going be up hill from then on. We took the opportunity to fill our water bottles, and then started our first ascent. This involved a very steep scramble up to a high pass, which we then traversed for the next hour or so. The views were quite breath taking, and set the scene for the next four days. What a place; it was like nowhere else on earth. I took some pictures, and quickly realized that I was going to have to ration myself or I would shoot all my film in the first two days. 
<P align=justify>
Just after one o'clock we dropped down to an Oasis for lunch, were we met up again with the blue team. The Oasis turned out to be a small clump of palm trees by a dried up wadi. It seems that the collective desert noun for any fauna consisting of more than two trees is an Oasis. 
<P align=justify>Lunch had been prepared by some of the Egyptian support crew who had gone on ahead with the Bedouins by camel. In these harsh conditions I was expecting a very meager fare. But, like the rest of the trip, the reality far exceeded my expectations. Spread out on blankets under the palm trees was a veritable feast of salads, humus, goats cheese, rice, pasta, beans, a kind of sausage stew and fresh fruit.
<P align=justify>
Nassau, a young Egyptian with holiday poster smile, was my friend - like a restaurant proprietor fussing over a familiar customer, he took a personal interest in my diet. The moment Nassau spotted me in the queue he would whip the plate out of my hand, ladle mountains of food onto it, and then insist on personally carrying it over to where I was sitting.     
<P align=justify>
I was just starting to get comfortable when it was time to move again. There was a flurry of activity, as boots were laced; water bottles topped up; sun block applied. Then, one, two, three and we were off, striding purposely into the afternoon.
<P align=justify>
 After walking for an hour or so, we reached our first major landmark, the coloured canyon. In the glossy literature we were sent about the walk, the coloured canyon was described as a beautiful sandstone canyon of multicoloured sculptured stones of every shape and size - this understated it. 
<P align=justify>
We walked in single file through a surreal Salvador Dali landscape of twisted and distorted rocks, like tourists in a cathedral we talked in hushed tones as our voices echoed around us. It felt unreal, as if we were walking through a dream, but dreams  are always ending far to soon; and we were woken abruptly by the hole. The Hole consisted of a short steep scramble, and then a series of contortions as you tried to haul yourself under a rock wedged between two narrow canyon walls. For the larger members of the party it presented quite a challenge. This was the first of the 'oh shit, you must be joking' obstacles, that our guides had very kindly arranged for us. Which like a good chili sauce added a touch of spice to each day. Nevertheless, with much pushing, shoving, cursing, not to mention, grazed and bruised elbows we all some how or other got though. 
<P align=justify>
 By the time we had emerged from the coloured canyon it was nearly five o'clock, we had been walking a good eight hours, and were starting to feel pretty tired. But we still had one final leg aching climb to do, and then there it was; to our great relief we could just see the campsite in the distance.  I walked the last stretch with Paul who, as a nineteen-year-old student, studying conservation and ecology at Sussex University, was the baby of the party. Sore feet apart, we both felt a sense of elation at having completed the first day. We joked that if that was an easy day, then what was a difficult day going to be like?  We would soon find out!
