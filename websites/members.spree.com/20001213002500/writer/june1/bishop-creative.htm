	<P>I've never considered myself a fiction writer. My brain
thinks in facts and things I "know." My imagination isn't
very well developed, I guess. Or maybe, just because fiction
writing is so hard for me, I've convinced myself that I
can't do it. But every now and then I get the urge to be
"creative" and the following writing exercise was a result
of one of those creative binges. Want to try it?</P>

<P>Just for fun, draw lines on a sheet of paper to create six
columns. Now, write one word at the top of each column. The
words should be totally unrelated and the first thing that
pops into your mind. Now, below the first word, list all the
words you can think of that rhyme with that word. Proper
nouns are acceptable. Do the same for the other five words.</P>

<P>Now comes the fun part.</P>

<P>Using each word, or a variation of it, at least once, create
a story with the words. It doesn't have to make sense, but
try to weave some semblance of logic into it. The idea is to
WRITE, first off, and then to use your imagination. It's
harder than you think, so it makes you use your brain, too.
What more could you ask of a writing exercise?</P>

<P>And here is and "story." Tell me what you think. But be
nice... I warned you that I'm not a fiction writer!</P>
<P>
In a house sealed tight on a passable night, a lass named
Mabel lost her medal for being the "Sassiest Writer" in town
when she allowed her light to be hidden beneath a pedal.
Mabel was light years ahead of her class in fables, labels
and rites and had even written a short song during one
particularly long and boring mass.</P>

<P>With insight and compassion, Mabel often wrote of rifts
between miffed spouses, glass houses and flighty grouse. She
never meddled in the cables received from others, nor did
she succumb to the temptation to peddle her words while
sharing a bite at the table with unsuspecting friends.
However, she was known to occasionally sass a louse who flew
kites in obstreperous heights near the sight where she
lived.</P>

<P>One night, in her house, Mabel spotted a tiny gray mouse
who, roused by her gift of Swiss cheese, decided to attempt
to lift the cheese for himself. Although by might alone, the
tiny mouse was unable to sift through the debris in Mabel's
house to acquire the cheese, he used his able gift of sight,
climbed the gable outside on this passable night, and with
foresight took one large bite of the cheese.</P>
<P>
Which action created a huge rift in his relationship with
Mabel, who forthrightly clobbered him with her broom and
threw his tiny body from the height of the gabled roof.</P>

<P>Above all, have fun! And good writing.</P>
