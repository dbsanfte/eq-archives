                 three, she began writing at 14 for friends in school, then through

                 high school. After that, she wrote off and on, until finding Poet's

                 Place on Aol.  Her first publish was in the premier edition of Emotions

                 Magazine, October 1997. Since then, she has been published and

                 featured on several internet mags and newsletters including Internet

                 Poetry Magazine (Premier Edition featured poet), Poetic Voices,

                 Sept/December 1999 issue of Writers Cauldron. 
                 Sandy currently has three chapbooks self-published for
				 to use while on tour with a group of online poets and has published chapbooks for a few of
				 her fellow poets. At the moment, most of her writing involves
				 doing reviews and interviews for Robin Travis, editor of Poetic
				 Voices.  She believes there is a poet in all of us. We just
                 need the encouragement and courage to try.

pug dog, and seven grandchildren who has had an abiding interest in history

and politics among other things.  I would very much like for my

grandchildren to live in a community free of racial strife.  
The current controversy over flying the Confederate battle flag
over the SC statehouse turned my attention away from ancient
civilizations in the Middle East back closer to home.  People
detached from the issue of Southern pride versus Black pride
may find the whole topic difficult to understand, but in the South
nothing but college football or the 2nd Amendment rivals it in importance.
It seems to me that if the modern Southerner really thought about
it, he would be thankful that the South lost the war when it did because
things could have gone on longer and gotten much worse as I tried to
illustrate in the story.   What I wonder about is how could anyone take pride in
a heritage that included slavery?</FONT>

Wacco Aeron Paul Wilson Born last day of June 1951, I am a mixture of

                 clashes. Born on a reservation in Montana and raised in southern Colorado with a northern Cheyenne

                 mother and a Celtic/Welsh father my life has been exciting and at odds with itself. To explain the matter

                 of my names, all I can say is my parents were also at odds. Wacco is from my mother and is Cheyenne

                 for "Heavens Wind" or the equivalent, Aeron was my fathers choice and is of the Celtic/Welsh

                 heritage. Paul is my Christian given name picked from the biblical apostles and Wilson simply my

                 father's family handle. To confuse myself as well as my readers, I write under all my names and different

                 combinations of them. Keeps me interesting critics say. I am a trained historical researcher, Work in

                 Archeology, Ethnology and several other sciences as well as the paranormal to support myself.

                 Writing has always been my passion, writing simply for the love and freedom of expression in words. I

                 have written numerous poems, factual and fictional short stories, historical articles for local

                 newspapers, magazines, minor book publications and the internet, as well as a full length historical/

                 fiction/action novel titled "The Existence Factor". I have done critiques on articles, stories, books and

                 poetry for private writing clubs. I am known as "The Colorado Campfire Story Teller" to numerous

                 boys clubs and outdoors organizations in my area and have a collection of these true stories of life

                 experiences circulating in various published forms. In short I am excited by life, like people and love

                 children of all ages...to me, 48 year olds are still kids with me being the biggest of them all...smile. I love

                 adventure and seek it out wherever I go, always looking closely at the excitement, passion and emotion

                 of a moment to capture with my words. I have written on nearly every subject and genre I can think of

                 including science fiction. My hobbies are writing, painting, woodcarving, model railroading, miniature

                 military figures, history, poetry, archeology, paranormalstudies, Arthurian romance literature,

                 Astronomy, mysteries and anything else I can think of that touches my imagination with excitement

                 and intrigue. I have a website called "<A HREF="http://members.spree.com/SIP1/aeron/" TARGET="_blank">The Storyteller's Hearth</A>" 

                  where more of my stories and poetry can be read.
