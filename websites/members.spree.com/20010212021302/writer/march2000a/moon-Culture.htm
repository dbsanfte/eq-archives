Sealed in a jar of one culture, flying from Pakistan to US seemed 
like a journey long in time and space.  That was my own personal 
opinion and feeling.  I had always felt an alien sense of nonbeing 
while flying from one city to the other, but hovering above from 
one continent to the next, was totally reducing my nonbeing to one 
round cipher.  Even our national language Urdu, pronounced by the 
air hostess' and charged with wired sophistication, was an echo 
strange and lonesome.  Islands of clouds suspended in midair and 
the oceans thick with mists, were distant and phantasmagoric.  And 
yet, when the plane landed at the Kennedy airport, the streams of 
light and color were cleaving through my Void to resuscitate the sense of Reality.
The plane had reached New York several hours late, and the connecting 
flight to Columbus had left hours ago.  The PIA attendant at the 
American booth was haughtily indifferent to my plea of accommodation 
for the night, suggesting no alternative, but to wait for the morning 
flight.  In a cauldron of panic, with not a dime to call my husband 
who was expecting me on the scheduled flight to Columbus, I was 
sucked back into the Void of Nonbeing.  One friendly gentleman from 
the American Airline, noticing my plight, volunteered to help me 
with a generous smile.  Half listening, half commiserating, this 
angelic person seemed to know the discourtesy and the miserliness 
of the PIA employees.  For, even before I finished expounding my dilemma, he exclaimed.
"Oh, these Packys (meaning, from Pakistan) always mess up!"  this 
gentleman was smiling again.  Not even suspecting that I myself was from Pakistan.
So, my first day, rather evening in America, was an enlightening 
one, wrenching me out of my Void once again, and exposing me to 
the light of reality.  I was welcomed into the USA with the lamp 
of courtesy and friendliness.  It was inconsequential that I could 
be the most hated of the Packys with no manners just like the taxi 
cab drivers, about whom I had vaguely heard polluting the New York 
air with their noisy imposition, and chewing on obscenities while driving.
A succession of years after my residency in America were a mingling 
of wonder and awakening.  The zeal and bigotry of the Muslims were 
projected as the essence of Islam.  Being a Muslim myself, and floating 
upstream in Cosmic Consciousness, I could feel the lava of distortion 
hurled by the zealous Muslims as purely Islamic.  Love, Peace, Brotherhood, 
as preached by Prophet Muhammed, were phantoms of the past?  Tyranny 
and injustice, practiced by the leaders of Islamic nations, were 
the poisoned arrows, darkening the western skies.
<P align=justify>Why do Muslims kill and hijack?
<P align=justify>Is your God Allah?
<P align=justify>Do you believe in Jesus?
<P align=justify>Does Allah tell Muslims to hate and fight?
<P align=justify>A shower of questions like these which I could not help but imbibe, 
were falling limp over the Truth in Islam.  Truth could not be expounded, 
it was Within Us All, seething with wonder at all Truths, distorted and maligned All?
A merciful shower in dewdrops of benign ignorance was coming my 
way too, which I could neither claim, nor avoid.  But these dewdrop 
questions were a whiff of reprieve to my sense of dry humor and ideation.
<P align=justify>"Do women in your country wear veils?"  an oft-repeated question 
like this I could even smell in the air before it could land on me.
<P align=justify>"No,"  I would answer laughingly.
<P align=justify>"Do you have guns to fight wars?"  a generic question just the same.
<P align=justify>"No.  We have plenty of rocks though.  And we hurl them at the enemy 
across from the border,"  a silly response on my part.
<P align=justify>"Do you have cars in your country?"  this could never fail to throw me in fits of hilarity.
<P align=justify>"No.  We have carts.  First, the wheels were octagonal, and the 
rides bumpy.  With a little improvement, we have designed square 
wheels.  On the way to progress, we are just discovering the invention of round wheels."
<P align=justify>This sort of inquisition had taken place in a school where I had 
started teaching, or rather learning?
<P align=justify>Nothing has changed much since I moved to America.  And it feels 
more like home with all its glory and ugliness, not some fantastic 
dream out of the pages of the magazines.
<P align=justify>The only change that hits with the rod of reality is that God of 
all religions is the same, assuming a different name, different 
guise, in different times.  Love, Peace, Unity as One is the message 
of all Faiths, if we can strip them naked of lies and distortion.
Inside this dreamworld of reality and ambiguity, I live here in 
America with my daughter and husband, I think?  A small pack of 
Packys, protected by friendly faces and bright smiles of the Americans 
in their own quest toward Unity.  The mists of hate, crime, cruelty 
surface here and there, but they too are the words from the encyclopedia 
of turbulent times in all entirety.  Timeless and inevitable.
