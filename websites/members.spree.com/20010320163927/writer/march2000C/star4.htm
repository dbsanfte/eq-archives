<BR><P align=justify>
And upon saying so he takes hold of the knife with one hand, in other hand its a fist full of 

creamers concealed by clenched fist which he presses up against eye…and CAPACK! - knifes the 

containers and the white eyeball goo shoots out all over the place.  This receives a warm greeting of 

laughter from companions, and a cold look of 'oh my god how immature' from the girls.  Oh well, Ahhhh 

(stretch,yawn) time to unwind with the comfort of the inanimate serenity of this diner.  A train tea-pots far 

away, as it blows so does Donny's heart, sighing on out, sipping on coffee…silence and sweet gentle water 

of mind flowing right on out of the gates lifted and on towards the sea.  Thoughts a blazin with romance all 

gone wrong with the wind, funny to think about broken-hearts, his heart broken long before any girls ever 

had anything to do with it.  Not long ago it was baseball, break my heart base-ball, home-team ra-ra 

baseball, home-runs, sexual metaphors, tough guys to soft, America at its idealist.  Brotherhood as well as 

real brotherhood - with brothers from the hood all united in that field of dreams.  Well donny's dreams like 

America's well too short-lived, - with the glory and sadness of one day - eyes of affection from every 

which direction fixed on you! - in middle on that pitching mound ready to showcase that laser arm, the one 

all the scouts dream about according to dad sitting amidst the crowd drunk, hollering profanities, 3-2 count 

crowd on the edge of their seats - let her rip…High-school…gassinip!!!  Strike-three your out!!!  Mileage, 

bloody tear-stained mileage that ol tendonitis shoulder that ol tendonitis heart - kicked on, spit at by some 

short perverted coach - the kind of pig that actually undressed down to the complete buck while cutting 

one of his broken hearted youths of America -(one of Don's close friends) all lined up single file outside 

his office waiting anxiously for that moment of clarity…baseball, break your heart baseball.
<P align=justify>
"Donny…Donny… whoa you were kind of spaceing out there, what's on your mind man?"
<P align=justify>
"Oh nothing just thinking about our past time that's all."
<P align=justify>
"We should jet my friends, this place is kind of freek'n me out already, pretty soon everybody's 

gonna start turning into werewolve's"  Anounces T-bone and so their off again.   As they exit stage left 

Donny hollering "Hey… Charity…see you in Paradise love!"   and blows her a kiss. 
<P align=justify>
	They head back to the dove, fire her up, and they're off again in search of a place, any place 

remotely safe-looking to sleep.  The clock staring on out glowing 9: 35 - 'can't believe it's so late, we need 

to find some shelter immediately'.  The road twisting and turning into more and more darkness betwixt tall 

owl trees, wind picking up, cars dissipating on road, soon its empty street loneliness of late night, and lost!  

Suddenly the trip feeling hopeless, scary, out in the middle of Pennsylvania nowhere where the beast will 

surely feast on our souls!  So they turn to the radio for some comfort…radio dial twists, on comes some 

evangelist preaching 

	"We shall confess our sins.  We shall pray to be cleansed.  We shall pray to be filled with the holy 

spirit, if we are going to be any use to God…it will only be through the power of the spirit…" and on and 

on as the dove rolls deeper and deeper into fog-laden woods and hills secluded.  To cope with the fear and 

disorientation the heroes pull into a drive-through beer garage and pick-up some tough-guy beer, IBC its 

called.  Then its back to gravel road, clock now glowing 12:00, 12:30, 1:00 and on pass the monkey's brass 

a quarter to his…late, need to stay awake, find some-place to sleep…soon!  
<P align=justify>
	"Uh should I uh turn here?"  confusion, confusion, weary-eyed confusion.
<P align=justify>
	"Um, let's just go down a little bit further…Whoa!  Look at that freek'n road!"  comments Donny 

observing a black path ahead leading across some old country bridge that looks just like one from a 

Scooby-Doo rerun where the thing keeps turning around and around sending the Scooby van back and forth 

in circles.  Brake-lights illuminate interior of car SCREECH red-alert!!  
<P align=justify>
	"Oh shit, I can't do it, I can't trust that son of a bitch bridge."  Says the Captain nearly pulling into 

a mud-filled ditch, so instead its u-turn, fire the dove back up and onward.  
<P align=justify>
T-bone begins dozing off in the back seat as Donny and the Captain sail onward down the 

abandoned country roads dimly lit by archaic lanterns illuminating the way.  They slowly approach some 

giant of a building high above perched on hill -passenger side of dove.  The Captain brakes to take a look 

at the strange sight which turns out to be a babtist church with a big glowing sign in front reading: 

'Jesus is passing through here tonight.'  
<P align=justify>
	"whoa what the?!  That's a pretty bold statement huh Insano?"
<P align=justify>
	"I'd say!   Gosh what the hell's going on!"
<P align=justify>
Just then T-bone alerts back to senses and some tail-wagging mutt comes a strolling down the middle of 

the road ahead playing chicken with the dove.  
<P align=justify>
	"OH SHIT" bursting from back seat out of nowhere "It's the fuck'n Beast!!!  And with that they 

take of roaring down the road like Mario Andrettie not looking back, flying as fast as the Dove will take 

them to a safe camp-ground, any camp-ground, the first camp-ground they encounter which happens to be 

the Deer Cove, and unfortunately for them none were barking. (instead just a hideous dog)  
<P align=justify>
	They pull into the driveway entrance to the cove wearing their road-wearied looks of exhaustion.  

Tires chomping up gravel - the only sound to be heard throughout the deserted parking lot entrance.  They 

approach a dimly lit office, only a mellow-yellow lamp on table and vase in window, the office just beyond 

the mammoth wooden Gates of entrance to the grounds - the gates look like that giant portal from King-

Kong (which happens to be the first movie Donny ever saw in this life - no wonder!).  Insano scans the 

surroundings uncertain what to do next, he brakes to read the hand-crafted sign on the office window: 'To 

rent a lot register at the office bla bla bla …gates will be closed at 12:00, and opened again at 6:00 a.m.' - 

"hmmm that's funny".  So the captain parks the car abruptly, acknowledges companions who haste not and 

mozy on up to the creaky wooden steps to the porch of the office.  Off in the distant darkness of the camp-

grounds - the sounds of tree-muffled laughter, fires a popping, and several rusty bicycle chains turning.  

Donny approaches the door to the office, twists the knob, again, unsuccessful…peers in through 

window…taps on glass…no response.  
<P align=justify>
	"Uhh…okay…hmm…what the hell?!…" completely drained from the perils of the first day's 

excitement Don just opts for silence, and awaits a suggestion from the others.  T-bone of course contently 

saying nothing simply yawning and lighting up another smoke.  
<P align=justify>
	"F it let's just head inside, if we see someone then we'll tell em we tried at the office right?"  

suggests the Captain.  
<P align=justify>
So much for a warm welcome…any-how the setting seems right for the weary wanderers, who all 

agree that it is simply another example of the beast (who evidently now seems set on doing whatever it 

takes to prevent this journey from happening swiftly) playing tricks on them, pretty soon he'd surely have 

his way with them -probably inside the cove in the pitch-black darkness of night.  Back to the car, start her 

up, and they roll quietly down the gravel paths alit by firelight, pass sites occupied by trailors, many of 

them appearing to be permanent arrangements with mail-boxes and names like the 'MacGregors' or 'the 

Glick's' carved into wooden addresses.  T-bone notices a spot of serenity off to the side of the main trail 

(leave it to him to find these spots, after all it's where he lives his life), Donny and the Captain agree, so 

they pull into the desolate strip of sites estranged from the rest of the Cove.  The strip nearly 

separated from the grounds by a patch of trees stemming outward from the boardering forest.  They pull 

into a spot beneath a broad tree - site 417.  The Capt. pops the trunk, grabs the tent, the beer, cracks one 

open and begins to set up shop.  Donny unravels his loyal hammock and runs it tree to tree between the car 

and tent.  When the tent is erected the three tired gypsies decide its time to get drunk.  
<P align=justify>
	Don digs into the bag of snacks and fires together a sloppy P.B. sandwich to accompany his beer.  

He walks over to their picnic table and plops himself down, the Captain like a true skipper charts a map 

with flashlight in teeth, trying to formulate some sort of coherent plan of attack for tomorrow.  T-bone 

decides he's had enough for the day and passes out in tent, soon he's snoring.  
<P align=justify>
	"Cheers Don, here's to the f'n Beast who's apparently decided to molest us this trip."
<P align=justify>
Then the two of them sigh and begin to take comfort in the stationary environs of their surroundings.  They 

rip into a sloppy beer-drinking binge, whacking down bottles at a time, the whole time spilling drops all 

over themselves - beer induced laughter percolating throughout the misty pine scented night, carried away 

forever into the Allegheni breeze.  Time standing still…home and sorrows far-away…school and 

responsibility even farther away somewhere down the end of the line - manana.  The two drunkards now 

atop the picnic table begin hollering the Captain's trademark beast yodel's to the wind.  Donny now a 

laughing hysterical mess of sentimental fever. 
<P align=justify>
	"Man I miss working with you, I miss hearing these beast cries all the time!  God, those were the 

days Insano, some of the best times I'll ever have man, you just don't realize it until their in the rearview 

mirror!  DAMN YOU BEAST!"  
<P align=justify>
	When the last of the beers is put to rest the Captain retires to the tent, and Donny clumsily climbs 

into the swing-swaying hammock where his poetry awaits.  His hazy-head a throbbing ba-boom-boom-

boom with the dizzying hammock.  Alone in the dark of the Alleghini's so far away from all the bloody 

pain of things remembered, yet now somehow closer than ever all opened up inward in this black of night - 

wish you were…wish you were so close to me.  Soon Donny's solitary laments yield to acute awareness of 

moment as a gut-wrenching sound comes a groaning across the sky.  The sound begins as a sort of cough or 

choking, but it melts into a hideous crackle and continues for an uncomfortable amount of time.  
<P align=justify>
	"What the ?!  hey did you here that?"  asks Insano from within the tent.  The sound continues… 
<P align=justify>
"God, that has gotta be the most hideous sound I have ever heard in my entire life!…Oh yeah Donny, I 

almost forgot to tell you about the beast's pets that inhabit these parts, the ones that you might want to be 

on the lookout for."
<P align=justify>
	"Oh yeah what's that?"
<P align=justify>
"The blood-thirsting tree-sloths of the Alleghini's!"
<P align=justify>
Laughter, but only temporal as the sounds continue to pile on layer upon layer a mad rhapsody.  
<P align=justify>
And so Donny sways amidst the symphony of nocturnal moonlight, 1,2,3 cough cough, 1,2,3, cough, then 

CA-BOOM gunshots in the distance, cough, CA-BOOEY and echo fading out into the mist rain 

sssssssssssssssssss and crickets…and then screaming from the heavens come the echo booming radar howls 

of early morning owls, ping-ponging tree-to tree throughout the Cove.  Donny falls victim to the 

overwhelming tingles of the experience, he grabs the flashlight and begins to write
<BR>
Donny hero's soliloquy <BR>
<P align=justify>
	Ah alive, always forever, this is where I long to be, I think of home behind and that alternative 

world of my father's.  A world I'll never own, because time- she already owns it, and me, I ain't gett'n any 

younger.   A world I loath to return to, a world of constant dramatizations of those glorious wonder years 

no more, drama, dramatizations, recycled yesterday's prancing about their stages of despair, tired of 

reinactments, tired of virtual net waves and the underground chambers of solitary hearts, tired of 

fear and detachment, tired of being surveyed by surveyors of solo-psistic boundaries, tired of that splinter's 

labyrinth of no escape.  I think of Mills, friend and personal hero (his story a whole other one in itself), 

Mills out West with his sweet-heart Rossie-Rose road wandering like modern day Kerouac's and Cassidy's, 

that's it!  That's the road I yearn for, a dramatization I can handle - young Jacks road resurrected, that 

road never-ending - Sal's paradise, a road uninhibited, an empirical road of Allegheni breeze-

blowin, moon glowin, owl-booming sound waves of this moment of forever, - SURF AND RIP THE CURL-

and ride onward to places where we rarely go, onward, upwards and then keep on going!  Till 

sitting atop this world with legs tumblin free dipped in blissful candy-cane kisses and tastes and 

warm embrace the sun on our face to love, sweet helpless love, and when I get there I'll be ready for the 

long-awaited embrace.

<U><B>Chapter 4 Into the Dream city </B></U></center>

<P align=justify>	Donny falls asleep in Hammock and the dreams continue (Meanwhile the skeleton break-dances 

wildly at an underground rave). 
<P align=justify>
 Hush little ones and don't say a word…close your eyes now and sleep…Into 

the darkness of all our nights we go, with Donny as our guide…good-luck Don, may you return safely…oh 

are you bringing them back?…sailing you say…well try not to get too lost…just try to make sure you 

follow the right illusions…which ones are the right ones…well, only you can decide that.   
<P align=justify>
Welcome fair reader to the city of Dreams, the portal between this and that, the place where the 

wild things are.  The other part of the script, where nothing is true, because everything is permitted.  

Welcome to the home of forever, as well as the home of the Fear - The Beast's palace upon the hill in the 

dark of night void where I sleep fear - A thousand crystal-light mosaic's of oscillating werewolves and 

Nothing's from the Never Ending Story fear, the I love you no more funeral goodbye of tomorrow never 

shines - fear, always the fear.  Let the dreams begin…
<BR><CENTER><HR></CENTER><BR>
<P align=justify>
	
Godzilla-beach, rocky-rolling wave crescendo of early evening dusk.  Quite a nice gathering, 

dream-impression of some historically-driven/holiday-like occasion.  Milky haze, crimson sky splattered 

with gleaming stars, blinking like Christmas lights.  Wandering the festive beach alone - and somehow 

separated from rest of the gang - whoever that is today.  Suddenly as forthcoming as the autumn leave-

rolling wind blows a cool, crow-cawing gust of shivers.  Sudden awareness of - fear - that impending 

presence that breathes beneath the surface.  Walking faster and faster, with each dizzy step scanning 

wildly for signs of companions through laughter, children playing, and on.  Then its "Ohhh Ahhh" the 

crowd in unison everyone gazing up at the sky.  Frozen in slo-motion steps gazing upwards at the 

stealth-like aircraft or star, black in color with red-marks like a black-widow.  The aircraft dashing through 

the sky so freely, so uninhibited, so unscientifically…amazing.  Then dashing to a complete stop, 

suspended in the center of attention, high above in scarlet-sky, Time frozen…all eyes fixed in silence 
<pre>
awaiting…then…

		      O

</pre>
<P align=justify>

	"Ohhh Ahhh Ohhh AGHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!  CA-BWACK!  Earthquake impact and rising up 

from the black n blue ocean the mother of all title-waves - a mile high!  Soccer-fan riot - abandon all 

civility - now, everywhere, nowhere fusing into one.  There's no route to escape, only the steep cliff 

boardering the beach.  Hundred's of men, women and children stampeding with all their might up towards 

the cliff.  Climbing furiously - hands bleeding, people dragging each other on down a rocky-coarse towards 

the sea below.  Closer and closer to the bluff, a body shrieks by nearly connecting.  Wave rushing near 

carrying with it an envelope of darkness and cold.  Somehow make it to the top!  Wave exploding against 

rocks into crystal rain with the force of Heaven.  Bodies drift away into the tide of the bloody sea below.  

Run, run, run don't look back, don't look back…
<BR><CENTER><HR></CENTER>
<P align=justify>
	"She was wearing toenails stapled to her eyebrows or something."…Early morning laughter…T-

bones laughter!  Awake!  Donny's eyes open to the sweet sight of the Captain and T-bone awake and 

already goofing, nose opens to the morning smells of fresh rain, pine, burned-out camp-fires.  Don 

inhales a nice long drag of it all ah…falls out of Hammock, strolls over to companions, and begins patching 

together another peanut-butter sandwich for breakfast.
