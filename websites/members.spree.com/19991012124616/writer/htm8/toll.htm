<BR><P>Sam Reynolds put the cigarette in his mouth and lit up. The car radio was
                 blaring out another nondescript tune -- the same tune that had played at
                 least three times in the last hour along with five others on the pop
                 charts and the station's playlist. The air was clear, at least as clear as
                 can be expected heading towards New York City.  The sun, filtered by the
                 pollution and near the horizon, appeared blood red. Traffic was heavy as
                 usual -- rush hour and a Friday afternoon made the traffic slow moving    
                  but bearable. He had the whole weekend to rest from his dull, tedious
                 labors. Sam turned down the radio and puffed on his cigarette. Another
                 week was over. 

                <BR><P> Sam thought of the gloriously dull weekend he was to have. Stay up late
                 Friday night, read the paper, look at the boob tube -- no one ever calls
                 it the boob tube anymore, do they? It's one of those what-cha-ma-call-its?
                 An anachronism. That's it! An anachronism -- something out of place in
                 time, just like me. A forty five year old man in a twenty year old world.
                 Back to the weekend itinerary. Stay up late Friday, sleep until noon
                 Saturday; saves money because I go without breakfast.  Read the morning
                 paper, listen to the radio as I prepare brunch. What a great word,
                 breakfast and lunch; brunch. Lie around the apartment, sort my socks --
                 face it! Do the same every weekend since Margie died. He glanced down at
                 her picture on the dashboard. Margie . . . why?

          <BR><P>       It was while he was at work. There was no warning, no note. He came home
                 on a Friday quite like this one. He came into the apartment and called to
                 her. Then he went into the bathroom and saw her. The water in the bathtub
                 was the most beautiful color pink Sam had ever seen. Beauty and death
                 etched a picture in his mind. The horror and grief did not come until
                 after the funeral. He took a week off from work and almost tried to kill
                 himself in order to join his wife.

                <BR><P> Sam was not the same after the incident; over two years had passed. He
                 became a loner. He had no family or friends who weren't actually friends
                 of Margie. It seemed that he had tagged along, allowing Margie to take
                 care of the social amenities. No children . . . how Margie had wanted to
                 have a child, and how she cried when the doctor told them that she could
                 not. It took weeks to calm her down and return her to normal. 

              <BR><P>   Then there was trouble at the office. He talked to Mr. Lane, told him
                 about his troubles at home, nearly pleaded with him not to lay Sam off. It
                 did not work. The unemployment line was a dismal place. The people who had
                 collected their checks for months smiled and passed the time of day with
                 one another. Those newly unemployed had the look of disappointment,
                 embarrassment. It reminded Sam of the refugees in Bosnia. Margie hated
                 having Sam around the house all day, moping all of
                 the time. He finally got another job -- lower pay, across the river in
                 Jersey, but another job. The neighborhood was bad too. Margie nearly had
                 another breakdown when he came in, beaten and bloody the night that he was
                 mugged. They stopped putting new glass panes in the windows and put up
                 steel shutters instead. The office felt like a tomb. No one could go out
                 for lunch, not anymore. The restaurants had closed, moved to a better
                 neighborhood. Even the office building was crumbling.  Just like Sam's old
                 neighborhood. First taken over by blacks, then hispanics, and now
                 crumbling to dust, soon to be paved over for the new highway they have
                 been building for the last half dozen years.

         <BR><P>        The signs went by a little faster now.

                 <BR><P>  NEW YORK 5 MILES . . . HIWAY DINER . . . SECAUCUS KEEP RIGHT

              <BR><P>   The light turned red. Sam turned off the radio and was assaulted by the
                 highway noises. Why is it that people honk their horns for no reason?
                 Isn't it a law that you can only use the horn in emergencies? The smells
                 of the city drifted over. You get used to the odors of burning rubber,
                 sulphur, and the rotten fish that float in the Hudson. The sun started
                 fading to gray in the growing mist by the horizon. The Empire State
                 Building was a dying ember in the New York skyline. A plane flew
                 alarmingly low over the traffic, heading towards a landing at Newark
                 International.

             <BR><P>    This was no-man's land, the battle zone between New York and New Jersey,
                 called the Meadowlands. Once it was a thriving marshland, full of
                 wildlife. Now it was a layer of garbage and soot and scum.

                         <BR><P>  LAST EXIT BEFORE TUNNEL

              <BR><P>   Last exit to what? Sam looked around at what could only be called
                 desolation. What sort of man would live in this no-man's land?

                       <BR><P>    LAST GAS BEFORE TOLL
                           CHECK YOUR FUEL GAUGE

                <BR><P> Sam checked his gas gauge. There was never any need to check it. He just
                 followed orders. Just like the people in Waco. Just like Hitler's men.
                 Just like the rest of the human race. Grow up, get a job, get married,
                 have children . . . it went on and on until the ultimate command -- Die!
                 Margie disobeyed orders when she slit her wrists.
                 Most people who disobeyed orders ended up like Margie. Why couldn't anyone
                 get away with not following the commands? His mother tried to before she
                 died, but she ended up in an old age home, not remembering who Sam even
                 was. What about Sam?

                          <BR><P> TOLL BOOTH 200 FEET TOLL $4.00

               <BR><P>  Sam slowed his used Chevy to enter the toll booth. He remembered when
                 tolls were a dollar. Now you didn't have to pay on the New York side but
                 they quadrupled the rates. The tolls were supposed to pay for the
                 maintenance of the roads. The potholes had been there ever since Sam could
                 remember.

                        <BR><P>   EMERGENCY STOPPING ONLY
                           NO BIKES, HIKERS, HORSES, TRAILERS 

               <BR><P>  Always obeying signs, always getting the wrong end of the stick. No
                 fiends, no relatives. Poor job. Nothing to look forward to. No fondness to
                 remember, only the most beautiful color in the world mixed with death.

                    <BR><P>       LINCOLN TUNNEL

            <BR><P>     Sam entered the dark tunnel with mixed emotions. Defeated, raped by
                 society, ruined.

                         <BR><P>  MAINTAIN SPEED LIMIT 40 MPH

Michael Barnett considers himself to be a "defrocked"
                 astrophysicist,
                 having graduated with degrees in physics and astronomy. In order to live,
                 he took a job as a software engineer and has been at it since 1979. He
                 used to write to help himself out during times of depression.
                 Interestingly enough, his life has apparently been good for the last
                 fifteen years. Of course, having a family with two small children does
                 make it slightly difficult to keep up with any literary pursuits. So
                 perhaps some encouragement from some fans would spur his creative juices.
                 Michael had originally published "Toll Road" in the "The Cat's
                 Eye", a
                 defunct ezine. He has recently published some of his science fiction
                 endeavors in the Planet Magazine  <http://www.planetmagazine.com>;,
                 which
                 currently contains a story "That Takes The Cake". His Web site has
                 more of
                 his writing, including juvenile science fiction, astronomical non-fiction,
                 and religious humor pieces at
                 http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/9634.
