	<b>
<P>Fed up with forking out for the latest piece of over-hyped 
plastic? Answer "What can we do now Mum?" by making toys from 
items you will already have around the house.</P>


<P>1. Shops. Save all your empty grocery cartons for a week or so 
and you'll soon have a shop any aspiring grocer would be proud 
of. Gluing down the flaps makes cereal boxes, jelly packets 
etc. look unopened. Clothes, shoes, and toys can all be used 
as "stock". Paper bags and real or play money add to the fun.</P>

<P>2. Paper balls. When the kids keep arguing suggest that they 
throw something at each other! Paper balls are easily scrunched 
up from torn out magazine pages to make "ammunition". When it's 
time to tidy up, stand the waste paper basket in the middle of 
the room and see who can throw the most in. A rolled up 
magazine makes a good "bat" too.</P>

<P>3. Doctors/Nurses. A roll of white toilet tissue makes this 
game much more fun as Dads, Grans, teddies or dolls are 
mummified before your eyes. Plastic medicine spoons and 
cardboard box hospital beds for toys are extra props that make 
the game last longer.</P>
<P>
4. Tubes. Cardboard tubes from kitchen roll or foil make 
instant telescopes for sailors or pirates, or tunnels to roll 
marbles through. Babies love to watch things disappear then 
reappear out of the bottom. Don't leave them alone with the 
cardboard tube though as they will probably suck it.</P>

<P>5. Cardboard boxes must be about the best free toys you can get 
hold of. Push in the ends of large ones to make tunnels and 
caves to crawl through. Draw on windows and doors with felt tip 
pens to make a house, add a flag and portholes for a boat or 
paper plates and a steering wheel for a car.</P>

<P>6. Miniature gardens. The foil trays that pies and prepared 
foods arrive in make lovely containers for miniature gardens. 
The children can enjoy hunting around the park or garden for 
twigs to make trees, moss for a lawn, stones to arrange as a 
rockery or a waterfall. Keep twigs or stones where you want 
them with a little blue tack or plasticine. Add toy people or 
animals and maybe a little water if the container is 
watertight. This can be a very creative and enjoyable exercise 
if you have children of very different age groups to entertain. 
A variation is to use play sand (not builder's sand - it stains 
everything yellow) to make a beach scene, maybe adding shells, 
stones and a blue paper sea.</P>

<P>7. Paper puppets. A picture of anything - colourful bird, 
clown's face, animal or cartoon character, carefully cut out by 
an adult and stuck to the top of a strip of card about five 
inches long and one and a half inches wide becomes a very 
easily made puppet. These give such pleasure and are so easy to 
make that you will probably end up with dozens of them. 
Magazine pictures can be stuck on to folded card to make 
theatre set background and wings.</P>

<P>8. Potato prints. After cutting a potato in half, draw on a 
simple shape. A triangle, circle or star perhaps. Cut away the 
rest of the potato, leaving a shape to dip into paint and print 
on to paper.</P>

<P>9. Skittles. Skittles can be improvised from large plastic cola 
or lemonade bottles. A little sand or water in the bottom makes 
them more stable. A good game for learning to count.</P>

<P>10. Dens. Building a den must be one of the most memorable 
parts of childhood as we all seem to recall the bliss of 
blankets draped over the airing rack in the garden or over the 
backs of chairs indoors. Even today's sophisticated kids seem 
to find the thought much more exciting than just erecting the 
shop bought plastic play house. I think the secret is to give 
structural advice about making the thing stay upright, but let 
the children do as much as possible themselves. Really large 
boxes of the type that washing machines and fridges come in can 
be had for the asking from the big electrical goods retailers 
and are useful for rooms within dens. Indoors, one of the 
simplest dens can be made by throwing a large sheet or duvet 
over a table. Cushions, torches,biscuits and comics or books 
will all be needed at the housewarming.</P>

<P>11. String. Children find a million uses for string, from tying 
up toy "baddies" to making a washing line for doll's clothes. 
It can be tied to chair legs to make a jump, dipped into paint 
and twirled on to paper, plaited, knitted with, made into a 
parachute or mobile, used as a measuring aid or for learning 
how to tie shoelaces and bows. It need never linger in the 
kitchen drawer again.</P>
<P>
12. Sewing cards. Stick a picture on to a postcard or draw a 
simple duck, car or teddy shape. With a bodkin needle push 
holes around the outline of your design about one inch apart. 
Using brightly coloured wool in the bodkin or a long bootlace, 
thread in and out of the holes.</P>

<P>13. Stilts. You need to do a little drilling for this one. Take 
two strong tins, coffee or clean paint tins are ideal, and 
drill a hole about one inch from the top on opposite sides of 
the tin. Insert a length of string and knot securely. Check 
that the handle is at a comfortable length for the child before 
knotting the other side. These are always very popular, but 
never leave young children alone with them especially near 
stairs or steps.</P>
<P>
14. Cafes. Children's tea sets are a handy prop for this game, 
but a picnic set or microwave cookware is just as good. Giving 
the waiter/waitress a little notebook and pencil to take orders 
and making a tall white hat from a cylinder of paper for the 
chef will add realism. Sit dolls and teddies around as well as 
willing Aunts and Grannies for extra customers.</P>

<P>15. Playdough. Mix together two cups of flour, one cup of salt, 
one cup of water, one tablespoon of oil and a few drops of food 
colouring for an easy to make dough that will keep for about 
three weeks if you wrap it in polythene and keep it in the 
fridge. All you have to do is knead the mixture well. Divide 
the mixture up first if you have more than one colour available.</P>

<P>16. Obstacle course. An obstacle course can turn a rainy day 
into an adventure. Use whatever you have available. A bench to 
walk the plank, cushion stepping stones across shark infested 
seas, through a cardboard box tunnel, up a chair mountain or 
through a duvet cave. The wilder your imagination the more your 
children will love it.</P>

<P>17. Easy boats. Recycle your empty margarine cartons. Use them 
as boats for the bath or paddling pool. These are so easy that 
even very young children can help to make them. Cut out 
triangular sail shapes from white or coloured paper. Make a 
small hole at the top and bottom of the sail so that you can 
push through a straw to make a mast. Let the child fix this to 
the bottom of a clean margarine tub with a lump of blue tack or 
plasticine. They sail extremely well and will even take a 
couple of toy people on an exciting cruise.</P>
<P>
18. Capes. Nurses, kings, queens, Batman, Superman - they all 
need capes or cloaks. Luckily they are easy to make by 
attaching ribbon ties to an oblong of fabric in the colour of 
your child's favourite caped character. Keep an eye on them 
though as anything tied around the neck could be dangerous.</P>

<P>19. Leaf art. Collect leaves and draw around them. This is fun 
for little ones and an educational tree identification game for 
older children. Colour in the details with crayons or paints. 
The leaves could then be stuck on to paper collage style or 
dipped into paint and then pressed firmly on to paper for a 
lovely leaf print.</P>

<P>20. Make a puzzle. Stick a favourite picture on to card and 
allow to dry with a heavy book on top. Cut into pieces, how 
many depending on the age of the child, for an almost instant 
and personal puzzle.</P>
