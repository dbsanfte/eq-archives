	Planning Your Personal Herb Garden</FONT>

<P>An herb garden can bring a person much pleasure because
there's so many things one can do with herbs such as herbal
crafts, herbal teas and herbal seasonings.  On top of this, you
get to care and tend for the plants which, if this is all you do,
is
enough reason to grow an herb garden.  Seeing how the herbs
mingle together and enjoying their fragrance are other benefits. 
By planning your herb garden, you will eliminate any
frustration that may arise if you hadn't planned.</P>  
<P>Frustration can set in if plants aren't properly spaced or if
your
plants don't look too healthy after planting.  By knowing what
your herb plants need, you'll save yourself the hassle of having
to dig them up later and reposition them or finding out that
Basil will not tolerate shade for example. </P> 

<P>The first thing to think about when planning your herb garden
is location.  Full sun is the best for herbs, but it has been my
experience that most herbs will grow in partial shade.  If your
herbs are planted in partial shade, they may not grow as fast as
when planted in full sun, but they will do just fine.  The place
to avoid is full shade, herbs simply will not do well in full
shade.</P>
 
<P>When you have decided on a location for your herb garden, it's
time to figure out which herbs you'd like to grow.  To figure
this out, ask yourself why you want to grow herbs.  Is it for
cooking, teas, potpourri, fragrance, or a combination of all
these?  Whatever reason you decide you're growing herbs for
will help you decide which herbs to grow.  If it's for cooking,
which herbs do you currently use?  You could grow these, plus
others that have caught your interest in the past.  If it's for
any
of the other reasons, do some research first to find out what
herbs are good for that interest.  Visit the library and choose
books on that subject, or search the Internet for information. 
Ask your herb growing friends. </P> 

<P>You will also need to find out if the herbs you have chosen will
grow in your zone and soil type.  Again, the library and
Internet will be good sources of information. </P> 
  
<P>Now that you have chosen the herbs you want to grow, it's
time to put them into a plan.  First, make a list of the herbs you
will be using, leaving a space for it's description of height,
foliage and/or flower color, and spacing requirements.  To find
these requirements, look these plants up in a gardening
reference book.  Decide what shape of bed you'd like and what
size.  Keep in mind that to be easily accessed, an island bed (a
bed that can be accessed from all sides) should be no wider
than 5 ft, and a border bed (a bed that can only be accessed
from the front) should be no wider than 2 1/2 ft.</P>  

<P>Now take a piece of paper and a pencil and sketch in the shape
of the bed.  Look at your list of herbs and place your herbs
according to height, and which plants would compliment each
other.  You can do this by sketching or writing in the names of
the plant.  If you change your mind about something, simply
erase and change.  As you are placing your plants, make notes
of how far apart the plants should be spaced.  You may even
want to go as far as using colored pencils to do some color
coding or to color in the color of the plants.  This sketch is
your rough draft.  You can use this as your planting guide.</P>

<P>The planning process can be just as enjoyable as planting and
caring for the herbs.  It also enables you to get to know your
plants before they are even planted.  Finally, as mentioned
above, it will save you a great deal of frustration, so take the
time to plan your personal herb garden.</P>
