	<P>Ahhh! The never-ending battle. I'm sure you've heard both 
statements made with passion. Those that believe you must 
walk your customer through each and every benefit preach, 
"Long copy sells better!" Proponents of this copywriting 
method say customers need to be "lead" or "teased" into 
reading the next paragraph and the next. Finally, when 
you have them drooling, you reveal the punch line.</P>

<P>On the other hand, advocates of short copy state that 
consumers today have extremely short attention spans. 
Copy that's "to-the-point" is a necessity in order to 
make a sale at all. According to these experts, the
long, drawn-out copy gets tossed right out the window
by busy, impatient readers. Feed it to them fast or 
you'll lose them to the competition. So exactly who's 
right? They both are!</P>

<P>No, I'm not being politically correct and I'm not avoiding 
the issue. The honest truth is that all people in the world 
do not communicate in the same way. Due to this fact, no 
one copywriting approach will work with every single product 
or service. As with every other aspect of advertising, you 
must look to your target audience for the answer.</P>

<P>I've used this analogy for years... when you begin to write a 
letter you do not sit down and write then decide who you will 
mail the letter to. Before you put pen to paper you know who 
the recipient of the message will be. You know their 
communication style and how to best phrase the information 
so it will be well received. The same applies to copywriting.</P>

<P>Let's say, just as an example, that your target audience 
consists of small business owners. These business owners 
happen to all be Certified Public Accountants. Just from 
this tiny bit of information I can tell you the target 
group is extremely busy, is very detail oriented and has 
a bottom line mentality. These people are generally 
analytical thinkers. Based on these facts, I would not 
write copy to this target audience in long form. 
Why? It would most likely not be read. </P>
<P>
The group above communicates in short, precise bursts. They 
are looking for the bottom line first and an explanation 
afterwards. The most effective way to get the attention of 
this group (in writing) is to keep it short, sweet and to 
the point. Otherwise you will lose them in what they consider 
to be a "bunch of fluff". These folks are definitely members 
of the short copy group.</P>

<P>So who belongs to the long copy group? People making an 
investment for one. I don't mean an investment in the stock 
market (so to speak).  I'm talking about people who are going 
to make a large investment of time or money in anything. People 
who are thinking of joining an affiliate program or multilevel 
marketing program would be receptive to long form copy. Those 
who are going to invest many hours in a self-help process would 
appreciate long copy. Let me explain.</P>

<P>When people are going to invest time or money (or both) in 
something they get nervous. Customers need to be reassured 
that they are making the right decision. They need to be 
reminded of why they need to purchase this product or service. 
A wealth of information makes these prospective clients more 
secure about their decision.</P>
<P>
Yes, there are other target groups that would benefit from both 
long form and short form copy. There are a multitude of them to 
say the least. As the advertiser, your job is to discover which 
type of communication style will be received well by your 
prospects. (A company named Myers-Briggs offers an excellent 
course on defining communication styles. I've participated in 
their training and found it to be highly beneficial.)
</P><P>
So what about the writers who swear their copywriting approach
will cause major increases in response rates? What about the
writers who say their method works for any product or service?</P>

<P>"But this guy said his copywriting style caused a 50% increase 
in the direct mail response rate of a jewelry store." I've heard 
this at least a hundred times. Maybe it did. However, I've never 
been a real fan of statistics when used to prove a point such as 
this. </P>

<P>There are two items in the above statement that cause me 
concern. The first is the percentage. We don't know how many 
direct mail pieces were originally mailed. Perhaps on the first 
campaign 50 envelopes were sent. Direct mail normally provides 
a 1-3% response rate. If we allow the 3% in our example, that 
would mean the original campaign received 1.5 responses. A 50% 
increase means the mailing using the new copywriting style 
received 2.25 responses. Technically, that is a 50% increase even 
if only 2 people responded.</P>

<P>The second alarm that goes off is the phrase "response rate". 
Most advertisers don't understand this statement. Response rate 
does not equal sales. Response rate equals responses. Literally, 
if a person calls to ask a question in relation to the mailing it 
is considered a response - even if that person never purchases. 
I caution you to beware of those with "one size fits all" copy-
writing approaches.</P>

<P>Yes, there are big names out there that will tell you that one 
particular style of copy works to sell each and every product 
and service. Again, technically, I suppose they are right. 
However, it does not sell to each and every target audience 
member. If you don't get through to the target audience, the 
copy - regardless of who's style it is - is a waste of time and 
effort.</P>
