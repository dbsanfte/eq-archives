<pre>
Who are you?
I am the child within
And I have given and given
And you just take and take
You wont love me back
And you leave me
And desert me
And abandon me
And I have loved you dearly
And tried really hard to please you.

But now I feel so scared
Like I'm about to die
So now you feel like screaming
At my weakness and self-pity
And now your time is taken 
With your work and friends and interests
And of course you love and care
But you need time for yourself
And there are oh so many obstacle in the way
And it's really busy at the office.

God I wish you were me
For just ten lousy seconds
And you could hear all the indifference
Bellowing off in the distance.

Do I feel suicidal?
How the hell would I know -
I don't know from suicidal.
I know I wish that I was dead.
But could I do that to my children?
I could do that to myself
I could sleep the longest sleep
What on earth would I want to do here?
Why on earth should I want to stay here?
What the fuck is going on here?



When I find someone to love
They only run and hide
Or commence the selfish spiral
And then I hear the rumble
Growing louder, growing closer
And all the stampeding pain
Clatters over and over and over me
And you shout above the racket
"give yourself some love" or
"get yourself a life" or
Some other heartfelt gratuitous remark
To get me off your back.
Sure, you're not responsible
None of us ever are.

Yes, I am the Sparkling Child
Don't you worry 'bout those bruises.
I've been tortured by professional
Ministers of pain.
Yours wasn't even deliberate
It was the accident you had to have 
In your journey of self discovery;
I am that thing you did last week
I am the flotsam in your wake.

And isnt it a pity
And isnt it a worry
At one time I was worthy 
Now you'll call me if you need me.

You know, I was standing really strong
And I loved you from a distance
So you couldn't hurt me back
When I didn't meet your hopes
And your wishes and expectations.

But you told me that you loved me
And you really, truly wanted
To be with me and to share
In all our special everythings
In our joy and in our harmony
What a pretty little picture.
All that's missing is the artist.
So here I'm sitting sadly
All lost and very lonely
And so very, very sorry
That I ever, ever came 
Out here to play 
In your sweet and precious garden.
