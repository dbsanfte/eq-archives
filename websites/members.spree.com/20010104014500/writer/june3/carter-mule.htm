<P>I finally got it all together. Twenty-nine days in the Alfred Moniere Memorial Wilderness, with one resupply drop. My partner's a little green in the back-country, but he rides pretty well, and it's obvious that he tries hard. I've taught him to throw the box-hitch on the mule packs--he almost can do it the right way. This morning I let him tie the load on the kitchen mule all by himself, while I enjoyed another cup of coffee, and supervised from a handy rock near the campfire. 
</P>
<P>The load didn't slip until around noon. Having to climb down the rocks to retrieve the pack bags and their contents from the stream, it takes two hours to get it all together and put it back on the kitchen mule. My partner steadies both horses and the two mules on the narrow trail while I repack. The mules stand quietly, but exchange meaningful glances. 
</P>
<P>We get to Lush Meadows Lake at dark. The meadow has been mowed by a herd of cattle. Our animals spend the night clattering around in the rocks above camp, looking for stuff that cows won't eat. Cows walk through our camp several times during the night. The boy wanted to sit up and talk, but I hit the sack early and left him to commune with the stars all by himself. 
</P>
<P>Next morning when I climb out of my bag, I discover that my partner didn't save enough firewood for breakfast. He's my sister's boy--a good kid, bless his heart, but he's a little thoughtless now and then. I have to gather more wood before I can put the coffee on to boil. This time, when we load the mules, I tie both loads myself. No more of that repacking on steep trail stuff. 
</P>
<P>Today is twenty-three miles of scenery. We clatter over Slide Rock Pass, along the Jerk Bone Trail, then traverse the face of Broken Bones Canyon. The Rolling Bones River winds through the bottom of the canyon, two thousand feet below my outside stirrup. I try to think about tonight's camp at Titsupp Lake, a lovely six-acre pond tucked in a notch above the river, well off the main trail. The kid has been sniveling all day because I left the skillet at the Lush Meadows camp. In fact, he's turning into an actual motormouth. 
</P>
<P>We arrive at Titsupp Lake an hour before dark, to find that Yalcom's Pack Station has dropped off the Church of the Changing Times for their annual summer solstice celebration. After a few hellos and howdys, the acolytes gather around to watch me and my partner unload the mules. One of them asks what's wrong with that horse's ears. I launch my "This Mule Ain't a Horse" lecture. They get bored and leave. 
</P>
<P>Although the animals are tired and hungry, they don't get to graze much because I have to keep them tied in camp to keep the acolytes from stuffing them with the brown-rice and veggie burritos left over from the sunset invocation. The kid burns the potatoes when he tries to fry them in the stew pot. We eat in the dark. 
</P>
<P>No one gets much sleep that night on account of the midnight ceremony, during which the High Priestess stands naked in front of the bonfire to channel messages to the congregation from the Cosmic Muffin. The Cosmic Muffin has doctrinal conflicts, but I like the water ceremony and the laying-on of hands. 
</P>
<P>My partner, who lingered in their camp after the ceremonies to discuss existential transcendence (or something like that) with the High Priestess, comes weaving into camp just before dawn, and plunders the kitchen bag for munchies before he falls asleep across his bedroll. 
</P>
<P>Next morning I do all the camp chores by myself because the kid says he needs to sleep in. By the time he gets his boots on, I've already packed the duffel mule and put saddles on my mare and the kitchen mule. While I'm scrambling eggs in the stewpot, the mules have a farting bee, gracing the camp with an almost visible fragrance of brown rice. The kid claims he doesn't want breakfast. 
</P>
<P>After a cup of coffee, he spends considerable time up in the rocks making disgusting noises. I decide to finish breaking camp while I'm waiting for him. 
</P>
<P>A group of acolytes wander over to watch me pack the kitchen mule. They have a short conference, then form a spontaneous committee against forced animal labor. They discuss their issues with me as I work. I wonder when the duffel mule will bite one of them, but he seems to be in a pretty good mood today. I hold my own with the acolytes. I even manage to be lighthearted, mentioning that I'd noticed that they didn't turn against animal labor until after Yalcom's mules had already hauled three hundred pounds of that damned brown rice into Titsupp Lake for them. My small victory dies on the vine when the kitchen mule steps on my foot. 
</P>
<P>He stays on it for a full minute, eyeing me calmly as I bang on his shoulder trying to get him to move. The acolytes watch in horror. I pretend to ignore them as they mutter among themselves, although I hear them use the word abuse several times. A woman with a good stage whisper suggests that the animal has kind eyes, and he will forgive me for beating him. Beating him. She actually used those words. The duffel mule bites me lightly on the arm to remind me not to turn my back on him. The acolytes applaud. 
</P>
<P>My partner finally comes down out of the rocks. While he is saddling his horse, he suggests that maybe we ought to lay over here for a couple of days. I tell him that we're leaving now, and I won't be back to Titsupp Lake until after the mothership takes these people home. We both mount our horses. Long after we reach the tree line, I can still hear the acolytes singing a song of forgiveness for me, for beating my mule. 
</P>
<P>We are on our way to Hidden Meadow. The first leg of today's trek is up the steep trail to Tenkiller Pass, atop Nosebleed Divide. The kitchen mule jerks the lead rope out of my hand twice on the narrow trail through the rocks, and refuses to move until I dismount to retrieve it. I notice the mules making those weird little gestures with their ears--this is one of the ways they communicate plots to each other. 
</P>
<P>By the time we get over Tenkiller Pass and wind our way to the bottom of Ojeezus Canyon, I am leading my exhausted mare. The mules have begun to stare me right in the face. All day my partner tried to engage me in a conversation about transcendental existence, or whatever it was, but I couldn't figure out what he was talking about. And I said so. Well, in so many words. Okay, maybe I shouldn't've said that he sounded just like my goofy sister, but it had just sort of slipped my mind that my sister is his mother. He used to be so sweet when he was little. 
</P>
<P>We finally reach Hidden Meadow. Hidden Creek weaves a sandy diagonal across the fenced valley. Thousand-foot granite walls shelter a hundred level acres, with good stock gates at the exits. The grass is as high as my mare's chest, trout are leaping out of the creek to catch grasshoppers in the air, and a cedar snag has toppled next to the horsecamp, scattering dry limbwood all over the place. I lead the mules to the campsite while my partner slides the stockgate into place. 
</P>
<P>"We'll layover here for a couple of days so the animals can rest up," I tell him. He raises his eyebrows up under his hat and blinks at me a couple of times. I just know he's thinking about the High Priestess. 
</P>
<P>This meadow could feed our stock for the rest of the summer, but we'll be here only two days. We have ten days until we rendezvous at Horse Pen Meadow with the supply truck my brother's going to drive up for us. He'll bring grub for the kid and me, hay and grain for the animals. My brother will also bring up the kid's latest girlfriend, so she can camp with us for a few days before we take off on the last leg of the trip. I estimate six days to ride to Horse Pen Meadow from here, with four layover days for slack. No problem. 
</P>
<P>After the layover at Hidden Meadow I am fresh and rested. The animals are strong and willing. The bear that visited our camp didn't get into anything important. My partner's still limping a little from getting nailed by the lead mule, and nursing a sore spot on his forearm where the duffel mule bit him. I'd warned him about those mules. I figure it was his own fault, but he doesn't want to hear about it. He's overreacting because he's still pissed-off about the bear ripping up his sleeping bag. 
</P>
<P>Nine days or so later we show up at Horse Pen Meadow only a little the worse for wear. This leg of the trip went pretty well, except the part where the yellow jackets at the river crossing stampeded the whole string downstream. I had no idea my mare could be that quick and accurate on slick rocks. The kid's horse could move, too--ran like a racehorse up that rock wall. Too bad it took two days to find the kitchen mule--too bad the shifty little bastard didn't drown himself swimming through that stretch of white water. I never did find the load cover for the kitchen mule's bags, my brother's camp stove, or the heel off my right boot. I haven't spoken to my partner since sunrise, the day before yesterday. 
</P>
<P>It could have been worse. At least it didn't rain very much, and the kid finally got the knack of hanging the loads so they don't slip. He sniveled a lot, but I ignored him. I'd've figured him to be in a better mood, what with his girlfriend waiting for him at the trailhead. 
</P>
<P>There are no horse pens at Horse Pen Meadow, and the meadow, of course, is a large muddy parking lot. I dismount, tie the stock, then hobble around the parking lot looking for my truck. My brother left a note on a tree: "Sorry I missed you. Looks like we go to Plan B. See you Wednesday." I look at the calendar on my watch, wondering which Wednesday he meant, and what Plan B might be. I hand the note to my partner. 
</P>
<P>Both mules point their ears directly at me. I look at my map. 
</P>
<P>"Okay," I say to my partner. He starts at the sound of my voice. "Looks like Poison Meadow's the closest camp. Seven miles that way." 
</P>
<P>I remount my mare. She thinks I've lost my mind, riding out of camp this late in the day. She trusts me, bless her, but doesn't understand that there's nothing here to feed her. The mules wave their ears. 
</P>
<P>My partner, emerging from denial, says, "You talking about that Poison Meadow on the other side of Yahnono Pass?" 
</P>
<P>I nod, noticing how he moves his ears like the mules do when they're scheming against me. He's my partner, he ought to know the truth, but I know he's going to snivel, and I hate to listen to it.
</P>
<P>"No problem," I lie. "If we start now, we'll get there about dark." 
</P>
<P>He moves his ears again. 
</P>
<P>"Try to look on the bright side," I tell him. "We've got a couple day's extra food on account of the stampede." 
</P>
<P>"What's Plan B?" he says. I can't outright evade such a direct question, so I shrug my shoulders, shake my head. I suspect he already knows that my brother, his other uncle, means well but is not always completely dependable. My partner sighs. 
</P>
<P>I turn my mare away. The mules follow. He falls in line behind the mules, wondering out loud why his dad couldn't have had some brothers. 
</P>
<P>We clatter across the rocks toward Yahnono Pass. Afternoon sunlight has turned Yahnono Dome into a pale red thumb on the granite wall. Beyond the rocky pass I hear muffled thunder. Behind me, the mules grunt up a conspiracy in their secret code. They don't know that I can understand them. 
</P>
<P>I pass the time by telling my partner how Yahnono Pass got its name. I estimate that it'll take him at least two hours to realize that we'll be out of food on Monday. By then he'll be too busy leading his horse down the Yahnono Trail in the dark to give me too much guff about it. I'm not worried because I know the trail. I was there, let's see, ten or eleven years ago. Maybe it was twelve. No problem. 
</P>
<P>What could go wrong?
</P>
