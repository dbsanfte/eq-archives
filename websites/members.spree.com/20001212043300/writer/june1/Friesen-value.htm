<FONT FACE="Courier New" COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1"><b>
<P>Ever notice how quickly we blame God when we have
troubles we don't understand? On the other hand,
if we credit Him with all the good things that
happen to us, we gradually come to recognize that
even our negative experiences are good gifts
from God.</P>



<P>It is harder to tell while you are struggling in
a situation, but look back to ones you had a few
years ago. Didn't some good come out of that?
Perhaps you had some illness or pain as a child
that set you apart from other children, but during
that time you read a lot and developed certain
interests that are key to your present life.</P>



<P>Or, you had an ill parent and had to learn to be
a caregiver for your siblings, and perhaps the
parent too. Now you are a responsible adult who
is not afraid to take on big jobs and see them
through. Would you trade this for carefree youth
if it meant you were a flighty, unreliable adult?</P>


<P>
Maybe you were poor, but longed to give gifts so
much that you struggled to learn some craft skills
just to make special presents for birthdays and
Christmas. Now you have reputation for your sewing
and people eagerly open your gifts, knowing there
will be something of your quality workmanship.</P>



<P>You get the picture? You could add examples now,
right? Me too. Many of them. I had that sick parent 
and had to take responsibility. I taught myself to 
make teddy bears so I'd have a gift to 
take to the baby showers.</P>



<P>So - if you are trying to run an internet business
and it is not prospering as it should, is God
really bopping you on the head? Or, is He giving
you opportunity to grow new skills and character
traits? I believe He is!</P>



<P>There are the beatitudes of Matthew 5, and the
fruit of the Spirit in Galatians 6; love, joy,
peace, patience, gentleness, purity, faith,
meekness (reverence), and self-control for
starters. Though I've been learning lessons in
all of these for most of my life, I'm still at it.</P>



<P>At the end of January 1999 I got a new computer
and went on line with high hopes.I had to learn
Windows 98, emailing, online movements, web page
design, and now I've been adding marketing and
ezine production too! But last May I had my wrist
in a cast, my niece was here for the summer, and
I had duties at church. I fell for a get-rich-
quick scheme and was off on a tangent a while 
this winter. Sometimes I've wondered "Am I ever 
going to get this business to fly?" My Dad asks, 
"When are you going to make that heap of money?"</P>



<P>Yet by all those delays I have learned to do a
higher quality of work, discovered the world of
marketing and promotion, to be patient with the
newbies - and myself, to discipline my time and
some organization. Also to discern the shoddy and
what is of better quality. Now I realize that a
sudden big success would have made me a flop. I
would not know how to cope with all that's with 
it. I started with faith in God for miracles, 
and now realize that He did me a great favor, 
allowing me these struggles. I have skills that 
form a good basis for success, and the knowledge 
to bring it in.</P>


<P>
I'm trying to be humble too, but look out the
miracles are going to be astonishing! Same for
YOU. Give it time, and spend that time learning
many things. Later your joy will be richer - for
your success will be stronger and more lasting.
</P>
