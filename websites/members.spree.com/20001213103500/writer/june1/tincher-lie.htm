 <P>Did you know that WORDS are only 7% of your communication?  
</P>
<P>TONALITY is 38% of your communication. 
</P>
<P>In case you don't know exactly what tonality is, say something
to yourself out loud.  Now, say the same thing with
excitement.  Now, drama.  That's the tone of your voice that
is changing each time.  It's your voice inflection, your
tonality.</P> 

<P>Can you guess what the other 55% of our communication is? 
That's right.  Your PHYSIOLOGY, or body language.</P>  

<P>In case you don't know exactly what physiology is, check out
the way you are standing or sitting right now.  Now, imagine
someone is shouting at you, and almost threatening bodily
harm.  Did your body language change from casual to defensive?</P>
<P> Now, imagine that that person is not the big bad bully, but
just your little two year old brother.  Did your body change
from defensive to aggressive, as in you are going to tickle
him to oblivion instead of beat him to a pulp? </P>

<P>Now, let's look at other types of body language. </P>

<P>Let's go to a party early and watch the people as they come
in.  Each of them is telling you something without saying a
word. </P> 

<P>Here comes a self-assured individual who's looking for some
fun.  Look at his eyes, they're looking everywhere to see
what's happening.  How about his posture?  Is he swaggering
just a tad in all that self-assurance? </P>

<P>Let’s check out the next person.  Oops.  He looks like he was
dragged to the party.  Look how he walks in.  Look at his
eyes, they're on his feet, hoping they'll turn him around and
take him right back out the door.  His shoulders and back are
slumped.  His thoughts almost radiate off him, shouting he'd
rather be home. </P>

<P>How about the next one.  Hey, this is my type of person.  He
came for the food.  No mystery there where his eyes went.  His
posture is only a memory as he whizzes by in search of the
goodies. </P>
<P>
Now, let's analyze this just a bit . . . </P>

<P>What did we look at?  Physiology.  And remember all it told
us?  And we didn't hear a sound.</P> 
<P>
Now, what are you going to do with this knowledge?  This
knowledge that your body tells lots more than your mouth does? </P>

<P>Well, think about this for a moment. . . . </P>
<P>
The next time a friend asks you, "Would you like to help me
with my homework?"  Or “move my furniture,” or “rake the
yard,” as opposed to “play basketball,” “go to the mall,” or
“come over for coffee” are you going to groan, then say with a
shrug of your shoulders, "Uh, OK."  Even when you DON’T want
to help him so badly, you can’t look him in the eye? </P>

<P>What did you just tell your friend?  No, what did you REALLY
tell your friend?  You just lied to your friend and told him
you’d like to -- with your mouth, but your body made a liar
out of you.  It said, “You REALLY don't want to do it,” even
while you’re agreeing to it. </P>

<P>Now, your friend, after SEEING how you felt, begins to feel
badly that he or she asked you. </P> 

<P>If you are going to go over and help, regardless *because you
truly are friends* WHY NOT MAKE THE OTHER PERSON FEEL GOOD
ABOUT IT?  </P>

<P>Let's see it with your body, your tonality, AND your words: 
YES!  Or let's see it with your body, your tonality, AND your
words: NO!  I mean, you're into LIFE for the long haul.  Why
not make people happy while you're here? </P>

<P>Now, let's recap.  Here’s a quiz:</P> 

<P>What if you lied with your words, but not your tonality or
body language?</P> 
<P>
Oops.  You got caught, didn’t you?</P> 

<P>What if you lied with your tonality, but not your words or
your body language. </P>

<P>Oops.  You got caught, didn’t you? </P>

<P>What if you lied with your body language, but not your words
or your tonality? </P>

<P>Oops.  You got caught, didn’t you?</P> 

<P>Time for another recap.</P> 

<P>If you say yes and you mean no, can someone tell you are
lying?   Yes. </P>

<P>How? </P>

<P>By listening to the words and watching the body language.  If
they don’t all mean the same thing, then something’s wrong
with what you are saying.</P> 

<P>If you tell people yes -- and you mean no -- enough times,
well that's a whole pile of bricks you don't want to scatter. 
Pretty soon, you'll be the one at your party.  Your party of
1.</P>
