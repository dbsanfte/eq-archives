<P>	"Serenity Now!" The Seinfeld fans among you will
                               remember the episode in which George's father hollers
                               this phrase just about every time a Costanza enters the
                               room.</P>   

                  <P>    I've been hollering that a lot lately, and it doesn't seem to be helping
                      much. </P>

               <P>       If you've ever been around me for more than a few minutes, there
                      is a personality trait I think you'll notice, and it certainly has nothing
                      to do with serenity.</P>

             <P>         I think I really dig melodrama in my life. I rush everywhere, and I
                      like feeling busy. The funny thing is, the people I admire most are
                      cool and confident, graceful and relaxed. </P>

                  <P>    Sarah Ban Breathnach, in Simple Abundance, writes, "we can
                      dramatically change the quality of our lives when we consciously
                      seek to restore serenity to our daily endeavors." But, she says, this
                      will happen only when we women stop behaving like "whirling
                      dervishes." </P>

                      <P>When I imagine a whirling dervish, I picture some kind of
                      gopher-like creature spinning and spinning and spinning until his
                      head is ready to blow off. Now, I've looked it up, so I know a
                      dervish really doesn't have anything to do with a rodent, but I still
                      like the mental imagery because sometimes I feel like a tense,
                      buck-toothed creature that just wants to howl and spin until I pop.  
</P>
                   <P>   I don't know where this melodramatic trait comes from. I don't even
                      like soap operas. But then, maybe that's because I live one (or try
                      my best to feel as though I do.) Or maybe, because I make my
                      living as a writer, I spend my days looking for the height of drama,
                      even when I don't have a pen in hand.  </P>

                <P>      In any case, I know I'm not alone. Lots of women create the drama
                      around them. Maybe we do it because it makes us feel more
                      important, indispensable even....the idea that, if we weren't around
                      to handle things, it would all go straight south. </P>

            <P>          Richard Carlson, in his immensely popular book, Don't Sweat the
                      Small Stuff...and it's all small stuff, says those of us who treat
                      everything as a big fat emergency are frightened that our own
                      laziness and apathy will actually take over.</P> 

                      <P>Hit the nail on the head for me, that Carlson did. Sometimes, I fear
                      that if I stop being all frantic and pressured...if I let my guard down
                      for one second, something in my psyche will step in and I'll suddenly
                      realize I never wanted to be such an overachiever after all. 
</P><P>
                      Carlson then clues us in to the fact that the opposite is true. He says
                      we have to get over the notion that  "gentle, relaxed people can't be
                      superachievers."  In reality, all this melodramatic behavior is quite
                      debilitating. It paralyzes us and keeps us from our creativity, he
                      says. </P>

                <P>      When I think about the energy I waste acting all frantic and
                      panicky, it makes me...well, frantic and panicky.  So, with the help
                      of my favorite self-help authors and the advice of friends that have
                      watched me produce my private soap opera for years, here are six
                      tips to keep us all from pushing the panic button.</P> 

                    <P>     1.Creative visualization works wonders. Imagine yourself going
                           through a typical day with the kind of inner peace that
                           nullifies real-world pressures. Visualize yourself behaving
                           with the cool confidence possessed by so many successful
                           women. </P> 
                    <P>     2.Use your journal to focus on your own competence. List the
                           events and problems you have dealt with successfully. See?
                           You can handle anything.</P>   
                         <P>3.Remind yourself, whenever necessary, that much of the
                           drama you experience in your life is self-created and
                           self-fulfilling. </P> 
                     <P>    4.Try not to take yourself so seriously. Make fun of yourself
                           once in a while. I love humor columnists because they deal
                           with the same life issues we all do, but they introduce a
                           new-and much healthier-perspective.  For example, my
                           14-month old can't get through the grocery store without
                           making a major mess of one aisle or another. It sure doesn't
                           seem funny as I'm restocking the shelves on my hands and
                           knees, but when I read a humorist's account of taking a
                           toddler to the store, I laugh. Maybe my life is pretty funny,
                           too. </P>
                      <P>   5.When you know you're blowing something out of proportion,
                           resist the temptation to pitch it that way to your friends. Tell
                           me if this has ever happened to you. You start thinking about
                           something and it gets dramatized a bit in your head. Then,
                           you tell someone about it. When your friend has a normal,
                           sympathetic reaction, you interpret the response as
                           agreement that, yes, this is a big deal. Suddenly, what started
                           out as an afternoon afterthought has evolved into an
                           enormous problem.  </P>
                      <P>   6.Work on single task orientation. I know, as moms it's next to
                           impossible to finish one task before you're off to another, but
                           a singular focus will help keep you from becoming distracted.
                           When we get sidetracked, we are more easily overwhelmed.
                           That's when the real panic sets in. </P>
