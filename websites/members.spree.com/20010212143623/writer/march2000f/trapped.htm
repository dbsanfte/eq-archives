Then I saw footprints coming from the driveway to the side of the house.  It looked like someone had been standing alongside the house looking in the living room window.  From my perspective, I could see footprints going towards the back of the house.  I moved to a back bedroom and looked out its window.  The footprints lead to the back porch and then returned to the drive.  A feeling of fear filled me.  When I got downstairs, I asked Ann if she had been walking around the house.
<P align=justify>
"No, why?"
<P align=justify>
"No reason.  I just wanted to know what it was like outside."  I teetered over to the kitchen window on the pretext of getting a glass of water and looked out the window while I drank it.  I didn't see any more footprints.  Who in the hell would come out, look in our windows and then disappear?  I had a nape-crinkling feeling - Sheed.

<BR><BR><HR><BR><BR><P align=justify>

The snow was really coming down.  As I looked out the window, it seemed as though I was in the middle of a gigantic pillow fight with fluffy white feathers flying all around and piling up on everything.

<P align=justify>That night would have been beautiful, except my sinister thoughts ruined it.  Periodically, I covertly checked the phone line.  It was still dead.  We finished decorating the Christmas tree, and were sitting in front of the fireplace reading.
<P align=justify>
"I wonder where Rusty is?  He's usually back before now," Ann said.
<P align=justify>
I had an awful sinking feeling, but I didn't want Ann to worry.  "I don't know, dear.  He'll be home soon."
<P align=justify>
"I hope so.  This snow looks like it's getting deep.  He'll be alright won't he?"
<P align=justify>
"Yes, Dear," I lied.
<P align=justify>
"Well, I'm going to bed.  Do you want anything before I go upstairs?"
<P align=justify>
"No.  I think I'll stay up a little longer and work on the novel I started this afternoon."
<P align=justify>
"Okay, goodnight."
<P align=justify>
"Goodnight."  I began reading the paper again when I heard Ann's scream.  "What's wrong?" I said as I hobbled to the front hall.
<P align=justify>
Ann was standing in the hall looking through the beveled glass front door.  "Oh, nothing.  It must have been my imagination, but I thought I saw someone out there looking in at me.  I'm sorry I screamed.  It had to be just a shadow from a tree or something like that."
<P align=justify>
"What do you mean?  We've lived here for two years now and we've never seen anything in the door before.  I'm going to take a look."
<P align=justify>
"No!  You can't," she emphatically stated throwing her arm across my chest to keep me from moving forward.  "What if there really was someone out there?  No, leave the door closed!"  That was a command.
<P align=justify>
"Dear, three quarters of the door is glass.  It's not going to stop anyone if they want to get in here."
<P align=justify>
"I don't care.  Leave it closed!  It was probably my imagination anyway.  Go back to work on your story.  I'm fully awake now and couldn't go to sleep if I wanted.  I think I'll watch some TV.  Go on, get going Gimpy."
<P align=justify>
It was what Ann didn't say that really scared me.  How would I stop someone from coming in and hurting us with my leg in a brace and my pelvis still healing?  They could go right through me without any problem at all.  No, I needed a strategy.  Damn!  I wish I had the rest of Sheed's story.  Again, I picked up the phone.  It was still dead.  I was beginning to feel trapped by the unseen, hovering and looming presence of Sheed.
<P align=justify>
Ann fell asleep in the family room around midnight, and I passed out about two.  About half past three in the morning I thought I heard a noise on the front porch.  Quietly, I got off the sofa, and noiselessly moved to where I could see out the front door.  It looked to me like there was something on the front porch, but the bevel glass door prevented me from getting a clear view.
<P align=justify>
I went back to the family room and softly spoke in Ann's ear, "Wake up."
<P align=justify>
Her eyelids twitched for a second before opening.  "What, what is it?"
<P align=justify>
"Something's on the porch.  Be quiet.  Look out the front door.  You can barely see a shape."
<P align=justify>
Ann carefully moved through the family room until she could see through the front hall to the door.  "You're right.  Something's there.  What is it?"
<P align=justify>
"I don't know, but I have a very bad feeling about this."

<P align=justify>"Why?"
<P align=justify>
I had a horrible feeling of dread.  I knew why, but I ignored her question and went to the kitchen and picked up the phone to make a call.  Still no dial tone.  Nothing.  Quietly, I replaced the phone, checked that the back door was locked, and headed back to Ann with a meat cleaver.  I didn't know what else might be of use if we had a chance.
<P align=justify>
"Here take this."  I handed Ann the meat cleaver.  She looked at me in horror, but took it anyway.
<P align=justify>
"You know," she whispered, "whatever it is hasn't moved since I've been watching.  That's strange."
<P align=justify>
"I don't like it."  I went to the door.  Whatever it was didn't move.  I braced myself, turned the doorknob, yanked open the door, and then retched when I saw it.
<P align=justify>
Ann dropped the cleaver as her hands came up to her mouth covering a scream.  "Oh, my God!"
<P align=justify>
Someone had cut a small fir tree, dragged it from the woods, and propped it up on the porch.  It was festooned with the dead bodies of small animals.  Bodies of birds and squirrels were impaled on cut branches hanging there by a wing, neck, tail or leg.  Some were partially skinned.  Their blood drained over the tree.  A note written in blood hung from the top of the tree saying "Merry Christmas."  I was happy Rusty wasn't on the tree.
<P align=justify>
Ann crouched down with her arms wrapped around her body and began to slowly rock back and forth on her heels sobbing.  "Who would do this?" she said through her sobs.
<P align=justify>
"We have a problem.  I think I know who's doing this, but I don't know why."
<P align=justify>
Before I could say more, we heard the sound of breaking glass at the back of the house.  I closed and locked the front door.  Ann picked up and clutched the cleaver so tightly that her knuckles turned white from the effort.  We hurried to the back of the house and found a broken window in the kitchen.  A fuzzy red-haired object was attached to a large rock on the floor.  It was Rusty's tail.
<P align=justify>
Her voice and eyes filled with fear when she said, "Who could cut the tail off our dog?"
<P align=justify>
"Herbert Sheed."
<P align=justify>
"That's the name of the man who called you.  Why would he do this?"
<P align=justify>
"I told you, I don't know."
<P align=justify>
I gently took her hand as I ushered her back into the family room.  I reluctantly took the folded fax out of my hip pocket and said, "Read these."
<P align=justify>
She took her time reading.  "It stops in the middle.  Where is the rest of it?"
<P align=justify>
"That's all I got before the phone went dead."
<P align=justify>
"You didn't tell me the phone was dead.  When did that happen?"
<P align=justify>
"Before you came home with the groceries."
<P align=justify>
"You mean we've been sitting here all day and night without a phone and you're just getting around to telling me now?  Who sent you the story?  And why didn't you tell me sooner?"
<P align=justify>
I really didn't have any excuse except to say that I didn't think much of it at first, but now after what had happened, I knew I should have confided in her sooner.  She was mad.  At last Ann calmed down and asked, "Why do you think Herbert Sheed is behind this?"
<P align=justify>
"I didn't tell you, but before I got the fax, Dr. Carmichael, a psychiatrist at The Bangor Institute, called me.  He was Sheed's psychiatrist."
<P align=justify>
"Sheed was in a psychiatric institute?  My god! What did he do?"
<P align=justify>
"He didn't do anything except write stories.  Dr. Carmichael said I was the subject of one of them, and he was worried that Sheed might have had something to do with my accident.  He wrote about it before it happened.  While Carmichael was sending the story to me, the telephone line went dead.  I only got part of it."
<P align=justify>
"Alright, we have part of his story.  You're a horror story writer, figure out what he's going to do next from what he's written."
<P align=justify>
"I wish I could, but it's not that easy.  I've got some ideas, but I'm not certain he'll do any of them."
<P align=justify>
"Well what are we going to do?  We can't just wait for him to make the next move.  We have to figure out what we can do to help ourselves until that phone line gets fixed.  With your leg, we're trapped in the house."
<P align=justify>
"When it's morning, we'll leave and go to the Sheriff."
<BR><BR><HR><BR><BR><P align=justify>

Morning came with a sinister start.  It was still snowing and the day was dark, and windy.  Ann and I went out to get in the car, but the tires were slashed.  We were stuck.  Sheed wanted us to stay put.  The telephone still didn't work, so we were isolated.  The privacy of our remote location, that we were so proud of, haunted us like the silence of a graveyard at midnight.  We were trapped.
<P align=justify>
"What are we going to do now?"
<P align=justify>
"Herbert Sheed has to be behind this.  I have to stay, you don't." I said.
<P align=justify>
"I'm not going to leave you here.  Besides, how far will I get walking in this snow?  He could be out there just waiting for me to leave.  Then he can get to you and me separately.  Why make it easy for him?"
<P align=justify>
"You're right.  If we're to be trapped in our house by Sheed, then we'll turn our house into a trap for him.  If he decides to come after us, there are things in the tool shed we can use to surprise him.  Come inside while I make a list of what I want."
<P align=justify>
When Ann returned from the shed, it appeared as though she had logs in the log carrier.  "Before I left, I put a couple of logs on top of the stuff to hide it from Sheed if he was watching.  Hopefully, he'll think it was just wood."
<P align=justify>
Ann and I nailed all the windows and outside doors shut except for the front door.  We drew all the drapes and removed all the light bulbs from the fixtures and lamps.  I rigged an ax over the steps leading to the bedrooms upstairs so that it could pivot allowing its blade to swing down.  The ax head was held in position by a restraining pin in a bracket with fishing line attached to the pin.  It was set so someone stepping on the line, would pull the restraining pin from the bracket and release the blade.  The weight of the ax head would cause the ax to swing down and strike anyone on the step.
<P align=justify>
"What are we going to do with the big leghold traps I got from the shed?"
<P align=justify>
"Take our front throw rug and cut a hole that's big enough for an open trap to fit through.  Save the cutout part.  We'll place the trap in the center of the cutout area just past the sweep of the front door.  Put the cutout piece of carpet where the bait goes, but not over the trap teeth.  That will hide it somewhat, especially in the dark.  Put the second trap on the top stair under a throw rug the same way.  One of them should get him."
<P align=justify>
"What if they don't?"
<P align=justify>
"That's why I rigged the ax over the stairs.  If he gets past the traps and ax, I have the chain saw.  You and I will be hiding in the bedrooms upstairs; but first we have to make some modifications to the closets.  Help me take everything upstairs."
<P align=justify>
A guest bedroom closet and the master bedroom closet were back to back.  Using a shop knife, I carefully cutout aligned sections of plasterboard at the back of the guest and master bedroom closets.  Then using the chain saw, I cutout two wall joists so we could slip back and forth through the wall from one closet to the other.  I attached handles on the backside of the plasterboard so I could pull them to close the openings.  Then we swept up the wood chips and hung clothes in both closets to cover the seams.
<P align=justify>
"In the darkness, with any luck, he won't see the seams in the plasterboard when we pull the sections back in place from the other side.  We'll hide in the guest bedroom closet when he's in the master bedroom; and move into the master bedroom closet when he's in the guest bedroom.  We'll go back and forth between the two closets through the hole.  When he comes into one room we'll slip into the other.  If he finds us, I'll attack him with the chain saw."
<P align=justify>
"What am I supposed to do then, run?"
<P align=justify>
"Exactly."
<P align=justify>
"If you're going to go at him with a chain saw, he'll be distracted."
<P align=justify>
"That's the idea.  It'll give you time to get away."
<P align=justify>
"In this snow?  You're crazy!  He'd finish you off and then track me.  Where is the cleaver?  I know what I'm going to do.  He'll have to take on both of us."
<P align=justify>
"I don't want you doing that."
<P align=justify>
"You don't have a choice.  I'm going to take out all the lights upstairs.  Then I'll get blankets and put them in the closet.  Finish your work."
