<P>	This past week brought tragedy as the Navy destroyer USS Cole
fell victim to an apparent terrorist bombing during a refueling 
stop in Yemen, on the southern tip of the Arabian peninsula. 
Eyewitnesses state that two individuals stood at attention as
their small craft, loaded with explosives rammed into the side of
the warship, creating a 40 foot x 20 foot hole in the ships hull,
killing seventeen sailors and injuring an additional 39 crew
members.  My sympathy goes out to the families, friends and
shipmates of the lost and injured sailors.</P>  

<P>A whirlwind of speculation surrounds the question of
responsibility for this seeming irrational deed.  Military and
civilian terrorist experts from around the world are searching 
for answers and reassessing national security policies and
boundaries in response to the crime.  I would suggest this might
also be a suitable time to reassess some of our own personal
boundaries and beliefs.</P>  
<P>
We will probably never understand or sympathize with the
reasons these two individuals had for taking the lives of so many
other human beings, as well as themselves.  One thing is fairly
certain though.  The suicide bombers performed this deadly act
out of their unwavering belief that they were somehow different
than those upon whom their attack was targeted.  They created a
mental boundary and decided that anyone outside that boundary
was their enemy.  In their own mind, they created an "us versus
them" reality that ultimately led to death, destruction and
possibly war.  It's an extreme example of the power of beliefs
and the firm boundaries created from them.</P>

<P>The creation of boundaries is nothing new.  We all do it every 
day and there are as many boundaries as there are people who
create them.  There is the gender boundary between men and
women.  There are any number of racial boundaries. We have
socio-economic boundaries, age boundaries and vocation
boundaries.  There are boundaries based upon body weight, hair
color, athletic ability, intellectual capacity, religious 
preference, dexterity, the type of car you drive, the books you 
read, the music you listen to, your education level and even the 
foods you eat.  Frankly, boundaries abound.</P>

<P>You're probably wondering what's wrong with boundaries.
It's true that boundaries can be useful at best.  I love to sit
in the "no smoking" section of a restaurant.  And I'm
sure that most women would rather not share the shower room at 
the gym with their male counterparts.  But, at worst, boundaries
result in division, disunity, prejudice and even death.</P>

<P>We are all human beings, no matter which side of a mental 
boundary we fall. We all have the same Creator, no matter what
name you give that Creator or the belief you wrap around It.
And when one suffers, we all suffer, even if only in a small 
imperceptible way. The USS Cole disaster is proof of that.  The
tragic deaths of those relatively few souls caused a ripple 
effect that continues to rock their families, friends, our 
nation and even the entire world.  And all because of a thought,
which grew to a belief, which grew to a boundary. That is what's
wrong with boundaries.</P>

<P>Spend this week reflecting on your own boundaries.  In what
ways have you separated yourself from others?  How does that
separation feel?  What do you get out of that separation? Have
any of your boundaries ever been the cause of another's
suffering?  Has anyone else's boundary ever been the cause of
your suffering?  Imagine how liberating it might feel to 
transcend your boundaries and be open and caring toward 
everyone, regardless of outward characteristics.  Imagine a 
world with no boundaries - a world in which all human beings 
view each other with as much respect, compassion and reverence 
as they do themselves.  Write your thoughts on paper or in a 
journal.</P>

<P>Let us look to ourselves first when we ask how a tragedy such 
as the USS Cole bombing may be prevented in the future.  We are
all human beings and children of the same Creator.  Consider
that thought as you go into this week.  Send me an email and
tell me about the boundaries you're going to tear down.  I'd 
love to hear from you.</P>
