<FONT size="+1">
<P align=justify>The necessity for a proper manuscript format came about in an age
when most submissions were either handwritten or typed on a manual
typewriter.  The accepted standard that is called the Proper Manuscript
Format in the industry today evolved because of the need for typesetters 
to have a consistent source with which to work.

<BR><P align=justify>Today, no company in the world manufactures typewriters.  There are
several questions in the industry about the modern day proper manuscript
format.  In recent years, many publishing houses and editors accept manu-
scripts in electronic form either via e-mail or as a binary word processor file.
(Lotus Word Pro, WordPerfect, ASCII text, Rich Text, or even Microsoft Word
formats despite the inherent bugs associated with Word Document Format)
The standards for proper manuscript format will most likely continue to evolve 
until a new standard is set.

<BR><P align=justify>Still, it is a good idea to make your manuscript as presentable as possible and
conform, in at least the most convenient way, to the standard proper manuscript
format.  Consider the fact that many agents, editors, and publishers in the present
day marketplace have worked in the industry for decades and are still very strict 
about the proper manuscript format.  There remain the curmudgeonly dinosaurs,
editors who pull a ruler out of their desk and measure the margins of the first few
pages before reading a single word.  This is one tried and true "measuring stick,"
to see whether the manuscript that they are about to read came from a professional
or not.  Having your manuscript in proper manuscript format may just save it from 
ending up on the bottom of the reading list.

<BR><P align=justify>So, without further discussion, here is the proper manuscript format.

<BR><P align=justify><U><B>Paper</B></U> - should be a good 20 pound white stock.  No neon, ivory, or other odd 
colored paper should ever be used.  Using colored paper will make your work
stand out and will also ensure that your work is rejected.  Never use erasable 
bond paper, even if you still use a typewriter.  Erasable bond smudges and 
editors hate to get ink on their fingers.  Erasable bond paper also prohibits 
editors from making corrections or margin notes.

<BR><P align=justify>Only use one side of the page.

<BR><P align=justify>Use clean clear ribbon or high quality printer cartridges.  The words on the
printed page should appear sharp and very dark, easy to read.

<BR><P align=justify>Never submit anything that shows penciled corrections.  Correction fluids 
or tapes can be used if you submit a clean photocopy of the page upon 
which the correction fluid or taped portion is invisible.  In the long run, it is
probably worth retyping or reprinting a fair copy.

<BR><P align=justify><U><B>Slug lines</B></U> - Better known as Headers and Footers, this information should
be consistent across the manuscript.  A running header will contain the name
of the work (or a shorthand book title), the chapter (optional), and the author's
name in the upper left-hand corner.  The page number will appear in the upper
right hand corner.  A running footer is optional.  If you choose to implement it, 
the footer slug will contain the name of the work and the author's name in the 
left-hand lower corner, and the page number in the lower right hand corner.  
The exception to the slug lines are the front matter and the first page of the
manuscript.  Slug lines are always single-spaced.

<BR><P align=justify><U><B>Margins</B></U> - 1 to1 ½ or more inches around the text on every page.  Wider
margins enhance the appearance and provide sufficient space for editorial
notes and comments.  However, the wider the margins, the more pages you
will ultimately generate.  If you have a very long manuscript, it might pay off to
set 1-inch margins all around as this will conserve paper and ink.
<BR><P align=justify><U><B>
Justification</B></U> - all text pages of the manuscript should be left justified with the
exception of Chapter numbers or Chapter headings as they appear within the 
manuscript and the page numbers in the Header and Footer slug.

<BR><P align=justify><U><B>Widows and Orphans </B></U>- Widows appear at the bottom of a page as the result 
of finishing that sentence on the following page.  Orphans appear at the top of
a page as the result of finishing a sentence from the previous page.  Many 
word processing programs automatically manage this and consolidate 
paragraphs and sentences on either one page or another.  This is called
Widow and Orphan control.  The problem is that this alters the bottom margin 
of every page.  Proper manuscript format says that there should be no Widow
and Orphan control.  Rather, the margins are more important.  Consult the help
for your word processing program to determine how to turn off Widow and 
Orphan control.

<BR><P align=justify><U><B>Spacing</B></U> - all text should be set to 1 ½ or double-spaced.  Indent the first line
of each paragraph by 5 spaces.  The exception to the spacing is if the publisher
specifically requests triple or single spacing as they sometimes will for specific
business report layouts.
<BR><P align=justify><U><B>Other exceptions</B></U>:  
<P align=justify><U><B>Single-space</B></U>: Use single-space such that there are no empty lines between the 
text
<P align=justify><BR><U><B>but double-space between each item in the following:</B></U>
<BR>Quotations
<BR>Bibliographies<BR>
Notes<BR>
<BR>(Some) tables - specific to the publisher's guidelines.
<BR><P align=justify><U><B>Triple-space</B></U>:Triple-space before and after a blocked, indented quotation that interrupts the text.
<BR><P align=justify><U><B>Quadruple-space:</B></U>Quadruple-space (three blank lines where text begins on fourth line) between the title and text of the:<BR>
Biography<BR>
Notes<BR>
Reference Notes<BR>
Acknowledgments<BR>
Bibliography<BR>
Appendix<BR>

<BR><P align=justify><U><B>Chapter Headings</B></U>:Skip three lines after Chapter number 
<BR><P align=justify><U><B>Long Slugs</B></U>:Slug lines, headers and footers, are always single spaced
<BR><P align=justify><U><B>Space between words:</B></U>	Skip only one space between all words, after commas, semicolons, colons within a sentence.  Skip two spaces after all other  conclusive punctuation.
<BR><P align=justify><U><B>Begin a new page</B></U>:Begin a new page on the first page of every major division of a book,
such as a Chapter.  Count sixteen to eighteen single spaces down from the very top of the page.  Center each heading.  Capitalize each heading.  Page number is optional on these pages.

<BR><P align=justify>Like wider margins, if the manuscript is double-spaced, this will make your final work about a third longer than if it is 1 ½ spaced.

<BR><P align=justify><U><B>NOTE:  </B></U>Spacing, Margins, Widows and Orphans: In the days of typewriters,
the proper guideline called for 1 ½ inch margins all around with slug lines appearing four to six lines
down and then the text appearing four to six lines beneath that.  Meanwhile, Widow and Orphan control presents a nice appearance in most venues while messing up the margins and wasting paper.  With modern word processors, there is absolutely no need for this waste of paper and ink.  Let me give an example.  If a story is 1500 words in length, using double space with Widow and Orphan control turned on with margins set to 1 ½ inches all around, the final product would be five pages long.  The same story using no Widow and Orphan control with 1 ½ space with margins set to 1 inch all around, the final product comes out only three pages long.

<BR><P align=justify><U><B>Numbering</B></U>
Front Material pages, Supporting Material pages, and the first manuscript page are not numbered (See Next Section, Do Not Number).  Other than that, numbering is fairly easy.  From the page that contains the words Chapter 1 to the page that contains the words The End, simply number pages 2, 3, 4, and so on beginning on page 2 of the manuscript.  The page number must appear in the upper right hand corner of the Header (slug).  It may also optionally appear in the lower right hand corner of the footer.

<BR><P align=justify><U><B>Do Not Number</B></U>
The first page of the manuscript should have a completely different header slug line than any other page.  This header slug will have your full name, street address, and telephone number, and possibly even an e-mail address, in the upper left-hand corner as a minimum.  It will have the copyright date of the manuscript, the final word count, and possibly your social security number in the upper right hand corner.  Below this slug six to eight lines, the title of the manuscript will appear followed by a space and then a "byline," with your name or pseudonym.  Four spaces below that, the words Chapter One will appear, followed three spaces later by the opening text.  This page will not be numbered.
<BR><P align=justify>The Title Page, A Table of Contents, an Index, a Foreword, a Brief Author Biography (also called a Curriculum Vitae), an Acknowledgments page, a Dedication page, a Prologue, a Preface, an Introduction, a List of Tables, a List of Illustrations, an Epilogue, and a Bibliography, an Appendix -- all of this is collectively called Front Material and should be included separately, each on an independent page or pages.  It is up to your editor to place the Front Material into the final layout as they see fit.
<BR><P align=justify>Tables, Charts, Diagrams, Drawings, Photographs, and Illustrations are also not technically part of the manuscript and they are generally referred to as Supporting Material.  These should all appear on their own separate page and the items themselves should be numbered in sequence if they appear in groups.
In this way, certain Supporting Material should be numbered sequentially, such as Table 1, Table 2, Fig. 1, Fig 2, and so on.  If the Supporting Material is broken down by Chapter, it can be numbered accordingly such that Table 1-1 and Table 1-2 would appear in Chapter 1 while Table 2-1, Table 2-2 would appear in Chapter 2 for example.
Where Supporting Material is to be inserted in the text inside the manuscript, as in most cases it is, you must make a reference, called an Indicator, to the insertion that should appear in the body of the text itself.  
EXAMPLE:  (Table 1-1 - RAPID GROWTH About Here)

<BR><P align=justify><U><B>Tables:</B></U>
Margins for pages containing Tables: 1 ½ inch top margin.
<BR><P align=justify>Spacing: Double-spaced between lines (rows) of a table and allow a minimum of three spaces between columns of a table.
<BR><P align=justify>Line up: By Decimal
<BR><P align=justify>Dollar Signs and Percentages: Type $ or % symbol at very top and very bottom row of a column where symbols are used

<BR><P align=justify>Now that you are totally confused, try not to worry.  If you have specific questions about the exact format that your manuscript should be presented in, there are other guides and other sources.  Often, the best source is your agent or editor.  If you are uncomfortable with that, one of the least expensive, though a bit difficult to come by and somewhat dated, is the Writer's Digest GUIDE TO MANUSCRIPT FORMATS in hardback by Buchman & Groves, Writer's Digest Books.  Also, you can consult the CMOS, or Chicago Press Manual of Style or The Associated Press' Stylebook and Libel Manual, either of which should be available in your local library.  The Elements of Style by William Strunk, Jr. and E.B. White is another excellent source, although it contains much more specific material about editing techniques than proper manuscript format.
