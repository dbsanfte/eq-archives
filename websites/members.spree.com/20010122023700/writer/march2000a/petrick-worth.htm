<BR><P align=justify><b>
"This seems to be the only thing worth fighting for."  Down here, beneath the churning of an everlasting dance, I have become content to wait out an indulgence like no other.  I suppose that it was the 13th day of the intercept that caused all mental function to cease, and for the rest of the company to become as the mud on the bottom of my boots.  Starting in the back of the head it took each one of them.  Each and everyone.  Two nights ago it was the worst.  Lying in my cubby of dirt and filth crying out to the stars, my hands enveloping what was left of my head.  Truly this was like no other.  Like no other that I have seen in my day.  Days upon days in white rooms and strapped to the cleaning boards without any meager hope of escaping the white monsters that loomed in and out of my drug-induced vision.  I was beyond sanity and yet consumed with an inner-heart of demand and reprimand.  <P align=justify>
Back in the city it was all the same except for the lack of screams. Children would dance and rhyme games of their innocent youth with me always at the center of their hilarity.  Buildings, towering over me as always, wore the sly smile of the aristocracy, and in the meantime, in my Hubble of rats and plague, my eyes would scan over them…. a surgeon of the world, cutting the cancers of social diversity.   It was not until the end of my prison time that I took on such roles of grandeur.  My penis erect with the majesty of the thought.  My hands continually throbbing over the course bricks, and falling into a puddle of urine, collecting on the sidewalk from the man to my right.   	We have become fathers of the brutality.  I have worn the skin of their son.  There have been times of wonderment, times where the fields of flowers would stretch beyond any scope of a madman's imagination.  Flowers of opium, flowers of gore drenched in villager's sweat and dignity.  Bodies would roll along the lines of these places in such maladjusted lustful heat, that they would scarcely see the bombs dropping around them.  It was only at the hint of me and some of my superior officers that some of them were spared at all.<P align=justify>
Sometimes in the middle of the day, when the sun is at it's height of vulgarity, I would see them doing mindless chores on the street corners and the alleyways.  Still in their lustful bliss but safe from the explosions and the dropping of bombs.  At times they would struggle underneath my weight until they remembered who I was.  Then they would be willing to offer the few moments of time that I asked.  Nothing more….I wanted nothing more than a piece of the road that ran with the fondling of war.  Back into the great halls of white, where the monsters wait with unbreakable straps to hold down and unbreakable bars to cut in.  It's been six weeks since the two nights and still I can hear it behind me, even when I turn around.  The guns always scared it away so now it comes where there are no guns.  No mines to keep it from following and no helicopters to render it headless in the spinning blades.  <P align=justify>
The younger men would always run the fastest…their legs getting caught up in the various ditches and crevices of the rocks that they were trying to tread.   Caught up and severed from head to toe in a gruesome display known only to the few hideous characters who were there.  Men such as these would be more wiling to bend over during the barracks annual cock-fight than to reach out beyond the whirling blades into the environment of rain that had been created by the toils of technological progress.  Oh, and the flowing would be marvelous.  Grand displays of color they were.  Shrouded in a type of light that would only be found at the most spectacular of manifestation.  Once the red dust would settle we could see the hints of regression in the piles and clumps of earth where the boys were once known to have stood.   Unlike I, they were soft as bread, and as timid as a babe.  Perhaps they were always food, from the very moment of their conception to the very end.  And the very end it always was…always.  
<P align=justify>

4:12am
<P align=justify>
	Morning is coming.  I can hear it.  The buzzing of waking man is tight in my ears.  Like the wailing for food or meat.  These never ending dawning times drag on through the helpless days.  Beneath me, burning me with a sandpaper face, the sidewalk kicks me from my dreams.  I used to know each and every shadow as they changed under the rising sun.  Each one would have a separate name and a separate face to greet me.  Nothing was so great as the day that they turned on me. All of them wailing their meat songs in my ears.  I think that's what brought the first years at the white place…the place where I have spent most of my insanity.  Scatting away from me, they shouted these songs not only to me but to the white beasts also who would come to the shouts in hunger for blood.  Punch upon punch they would offer to me.  If I were a machoist it would be Christmas.  But I was not, and this was no Christmas for a bloke such as me.  Was I a criminal in their eyes? Only the shadows knew, but they would sooner fling themselves at the beasts of burden that to tell me.
	<P align=justify>I think that I should like to lie here; so steady on the hard concrete.  Unlike other things it makes the thoughts go away, it makes the sounds a little dimmer, a little more bearable.  There was one day, long ago, when I would not awaken.  Instead, I could see nothing but the inside of my head; all jumbled up with greasy guts and hatred.   There has been no tolerance since that day…that is, all expect the days of tranquility.  How could I begin to describe bliss.  Should I close my eyes and think off all the beauty in the world compacted into one tine moment.  It seems that this would even be too much for the soul to bear, and perhaps it was.  I those days, my passion ran a deep red in the caverns of the earth.  Down, beneath the sediment it's swirling would grow in power and capacity till it would overflow the top of my head, running down my naked body as I ran through populated cities.  If I had ever felt joy, it was through her.  Sometimes I feel that it must have always been that way even before  I knew her.  That somehow there was an undeniable metaphysical link between the two of us perhaps going as far back as from before we were born.   My veins might as well pump with her blood or my stomach digest with her acid…I feel so much a part of her.  Desire seems such a trite thing in times such as these.  I feel there must be more.  With my emotions both fumbling and boiling within me I lay in my spot.  Faces torn with the wages of love scoff me in my place.   As my inner-self wages war for them the supreme commanders recognize that we may be fighting a losing battle.  Eyes shut tight, bring tears spying through to the ground.   I can't let this happen, not know…nor not ever.  
	<P align=justify>No one knows what will come of this, the storm in the distance charges itself with electrical blackness, and lately, night makes no promises to let up. Perhaps, I think, when it comes the end will be quick and mighty; but this is not to be the case.  Instead, the rain seems content on filling my lungs with its seed.  All this, however, may be nothing more than unadorned speculation, and all the above may be worth nothing at all. Not even worth fighting for.
