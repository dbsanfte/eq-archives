 from Boulder Colorado but I'm a sophmore at University of
                 Northern Colorado, studying Sociology. I've been writing poetry
                 since I was thirteen years old and I've grown so much through my
                 writing because it is the best way I can express my emotions, my
                 heart, my soul, my experiences. I can free myself in utter
                 expression of my being completely and vulnerably. I would love for
                 others in the world to read my words and relate to them in their own
                 way and hopefully be moved, effected or inspired. I guess I just
                 finally got brave enough or believed in my talent as a writer to
                 share my poetry with the world.

was born in Toronto, Canada, and, perhaps, more importantly, into
                 a universe that I didn't understand. Let me say right up
                 front...this bothered me from the get go. Even as a child I quickly
                 realized that, even with their love and life earned wisdom, Parents
                 could offer no insight as to the nature of human consciousness in
                 terms of my purpose. From an early age, it seemed clear to me that
                 most "Humans" were content to place the unanswerable upon a secret
                                shelf entitled "Don't look here...you'll just get hot
                                and bothered and your brain might explode" and go
                                about the simple business of being. For some reason,
                                I could never adopt this head-in-the-sand approach to
                                not having answers. I wanted them. I still do. I
                                won't stop trying to find them. Call me crazy (many
                                have and I have accredited documentation to that
                                effect), but I just want to know what is going on
                                with me, the Universe, God, Everything. Sue me. I
                                won't care. Maybe you're not even real. Maybe I'm
                                not. Cogito Ergo Sum. But what am I?  <A HREF="http://www.awe-struck.net/AUTHORS1/tannock.html" TARGET="_blank">Visit his Web Page.</A>

Eye have been writting
                 for about 12 years now.
                 Beginning first with
                 songs for a band Eye was
                 a member of, then
                 venturing on to poetry
                 after the group
                 disbanded. Eye became
                 interested 6 or 7 years
                 ago, in the principles
                 and utilities of magick
                 and how it can be used
                 to æffect reality. M'eye
                 studies have had a
                 profound effect on m'eye
                 writting, in that Eye
                 have found, that
                 expression through the
                 written thought is much
                 the same as expression
                 through the magical
                 vehicle of a spell. They
                 both work to transport
                 the psyche out of the
                 mundane and into the
                 supernatural. Eye have
                 come to understand that
                 each and everyone of us
                 is entered into this
                 thing called 'life' for
                 a purpose, what Eye have
                 come to understand as a
                 direction... If we learn
                 to find where we are
                 going, we accomplish our
                 destiny, but it is also possible to miss the point and journey off
                 in a direction undetermined... A majority of people move through
                 life as such... Undirected... M'eye writting reflects what Eye have
                 learned, what Eye understand that wisdom to be, and how Eye intend
                 to use it in an effort to accomplish what Eye feel Eye am here to
                 do. Life is a learning process, and we must first learn to
                 understand ourselves, and through the written expressions of
                 thoughts, Eye have learned how to know and understand who Eye am...
                 Perhaps what Eye have learned about m'eye self can be used to assist
                 others in their search for themselves...

                 the interplay of a few anagrams for his real name. a whole story
                 there to unravel. the possibilities of a world implied that requires
                 hours and hours of study; and daily discovery. then he says: "fuck
                 this," and quickly writes another verse. the soul resides in nicer
                 digs than melrose place. if townee's middle name was changed to
                 duane, what effect might this have on the some melodramatic
                 non-universe previously unseen?
