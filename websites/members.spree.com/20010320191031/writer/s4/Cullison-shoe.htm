<P>	Would you rather bathe in nuclear waste than do your bookkeeping?
Do terms like "straight-line depreciation," "accrual basis" and
"home office deduction" cause you to break out in a cold sweat?
Don't worry -- you're not alone. Millions of small business
owners dread bookkeeping. So much so, in fact, that shoebox
accounting will soon be listed on your Schedule C as a valid
accounting method (not really, I made that part up). I thought
that with a new fiscal year around the corner for most of us, it
might be a good time for an article on how to make bookkeeping as
painless as possible.</P>

<P>***Why shoebox accounting is not a good idea ***<BR>

If you need reasons, here are three.<BR>

1. You really have no way of knowing how well (or how poorly)
your business is doing.  Sure, you have an "idea." But wouldn't
it be nice to really know where your money goes, and how much
you've received in the last three.six.twelve months?</P>

<P>2. If you are ever audited, good records will make the experience
proceed much more smoothly than if you hand the IRS agent a Nike
box full of paper, pennies and pocket lint.</P>

<P>3. If you have an accountant prepare your tax return at the end
of the year, he or she will spend much less time on it (and you
will save much more money) if your information is organized.</P>

<P>Ok, so you agree that some basic bookkeeping is probably a good
idea.  Now what?  Below are some quick tips to help you manage
the task.</P>

<P>Bookkeeping Tips<BR>
1. Set up some basic files to help you keep track of important
documents:<BR>
*Bank accounts<BR>
*Bills to be paid<BR>
*Paid invoices (by vendor for larger organizations, or tax
category for smaller ones). If your organization is small enough,
consider purchasing a three-ring binder with pocket folders.
Label each folder with a tax category - auto expenses,
advertising, etc. When you make a payment, file the invoice or
receipt in the appropriate folder. File your tax return in the
front and start a new binder each year. Voilà! You now have a
permanent tax record.  *Customer files. Set up a sub-file for
permanent items such as agreements and contact information and
another for invoices.</P>

<P>2. Keep your personal and business expenses separate with
separate bank accounts and credit cards.</P>

<P>3. Automate! Learn a basic bookkeeping application such as Intuit's Quickbooks or Microsoft Money. This will enable to you balance
your bank statement with a click (or two) of the mouse. These
programs are inexpensive and easy to use, and they will let you
roll your year-end totals into tax software to simplify tax
preparation.</P>
<P>
4. If you work from your home, don't forget to save receipts and
utility bills to back up your home office deduction! Examples of
items you may be able to deduct for your home office: expenses
for telephone, power, water, gas. Pay only from vendor invoices;
if you pay from vendor statements, you run the risk of paying
again when the invoice comes in.</P>

<P>5. Pay your bills on time to maintain good credit. Take advantage
of early payment discounts only if the discount exceeds the rate
you earn on money in your account.</P>

<P>6. Use electronic bill payment if possible. You will save on
stamps, envelopes and time. Most systems will let you schedule
the bill to be paid at a point in the future. If paying your
bills manually, prepare them when you receive them, then note the
date the bill should be mailed on the outside of the envelope.</P>

<P>7. Set aside some time each day to handle bookkeeping tasks. This
will make the entire process more manageable than if you do it
monthly, quarterly, etc.</P>

<P>8. Have a basic understanding of current tax regulations so you
are aware of what may qualify as a business expense and what won't. This will save you time as you prepare your return (or work
with a tax professional).</P>

<P>This information is intended only as a guide for organizing your
bookkeeping tasks. It is not accounting advice; please consult
your accounting professional with any specific questions you may
have.</P>
