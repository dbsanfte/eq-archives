A DEMANDING REGIMEN

<P align=justify>
 
    With the trepidation I still feel each morning at those moments of
waking that once 
were so sweet. I am a witness to my presence in depressing events. I feel
I've been cast 
into a demanding regimen. For this I don't blame anyone or the one who
exists above 
us. I write the word "cast" with an acute sense that I'm the raw material
being wrought. I 
find my self jammed into agonizing recesses of the forge as though all
avenue of escape 
has deliberately been sealed. Someone is pounding my face and fingertips.
Someone is 
painfully searing my elbows and knees. I can't get escape even by crawling
out because 
the distance id too great for my aching bones. before i fell ill, I was
never thrown into so 
strict a regimen, and definitely not into so demanding and painful a
schedule. But my 
self-withdraw, a search for shelter and refuge, has pathologically addicted
me to one 
thing: the inviolability of my regimen.
<P align=justify>
    At the table in my small kitchen, I'm able to set before me the
electronic wristwatch my 
beloved family gave me about a month before I became sick. I can sit by my
green 
stationary pad and marvel at length without feeling any movement of the
watch hands. 
This modern timepiece has a dual display. below the white face marked with
the familiar 
numbers is a digital display of pulsing, flickering seconds and minutes. I
also can mange 
two tasks, perhaps even three. First, I jot down on the page the precise
hour and date. 
Second, opposite the numbers I record the jobs I'm doing. I do the same
ones each 
morning, the same move nets of my hands and legs matched to the motion of
the watch 
hands circling in electronic precision. And last, I gloomily ponder how
I've fallen - willingly 
surrendered myself, to tell the truth - into the prison of my demanding
regimen; how I've 
unflinchingly been cast into this without even seeking help from my family.
<P align=justify>
    Perhaps I should be more specific at this point. I get out of bed at
6:30. It's early, 
exercise time in the youth movement days. While still in bed, a moment or
two before 
rising, I stretch myself and roll towards the window. If it wasn't open
while I slept, I open it 
now. I curl my frail body into the pillows, which reek from my incessant
nighttime 
sweating. I inhale and exhale very deeply. Scorning  the complaints of my
neighbors on 
the other side of the thin wall, I do extra, take another breath and grunt
loudly. I focus 
myself on my breathing machine, which is barely working. This is neither
pleasure nor 
pain, a sort of total separation from the ominous morning and the wearying
day. I close 
my eyes, opening and shutting every orifice. The fresh, damp air seeping
through the 
cracks in the shutter flows through my body. I follow its course as it
refreshes me, from 
the soles of my itching feet to the thinning hair on my head. Inhaled and
exhaled, drawn 
in and doled out, consumed and absorbed again and again and again.
<P align=justify>
    In the rehabilitation guide that a young friend gave me when I left the
hospital, I find a 
complete philosophy distilled into dry rules. It had never occurred to me
that the air 
flowing through my passages could purify and cleanse me. If I adhere to the
prescribed 
cours, but only this one, all my ailments will be cured by breathing in the
morning air 
each day. But if I break the rules, or I'm not careful God forbid, or say
to hell with the 
directions and ignore them, or worse that that, adopt a program of
rehabilitation other 
than the one in this book, I'm destined from the start to fail and remain
tainted. The 
same air, the same body, the same man lying shrunken in his bed fearing the
day 
compressed between the windows. And yet, just one little thought, one genuine 
intention, and everything can change, for good or bad. The plan is for
everyone, to 
master evil and make it serve the good. And now, with the reins seemingly
in my hands, 
now that I have the means for complete salvation not only of my soul but of
my body as 
well, will I through this away?
<P align=justify>
    My bones ache from my morning breathing exercises. For some reason, the
pain 
lingers. I hear a faint creak of bones popping when I suck fresh air from
my chest into 
the hollow of my belly. Am I doing this wrong? It says here clearly that
everything turns 
on execution. Good intentions aren't enough. The entire world could be
filled with 
nothing but good intentions and results still would depend on execution. It
make the 
difference between the lower world of suffering in which we exist, our
daily world of filth 
and illness, and higher halls of purity that start in a healthy body and
end in firmaments 
never envisioned.
<P align=justify>
    What am I to do? To whom do I turn in my misfortune? Who will still my
doubts? And 
while I suffer through steadying my breathing, my strict regimen has
consumed my early 
waking minutes. Already I must bend over the cracked sink and the leaky
faucet and 
peer again at my face reflected in the mirror. This moment when I stand
before the 
mirror is the most difficult of the entire morning. Gripped by an
inexplicable fear, I survey 
my image in the glass. What has changed in me since last night? Have bad
signs 
appeared in me overnight? And what is the meaning of all these premature
wrinkles and 
blotches? Where is the oversize, up-to-date map of my face that I put way for 
safekeeping in my medicine cabinet? I must hastily pull it out and compare
it immediately 
with what I see.
<P align=justify>
    Now my breathing, purified by my exercises and toothpaste and mouth
rinse, is racing 
along on its own. Why the hell is thee bathroom light bulb so weak?  Why,
this is where I 
most need a strong light now. A pure, white glow by which I can contemplate
again and 
again how fearful I've been for no reason, how wrong I've been about the
darkness of 
the wrinkles and the fuzz on my spots. Well, I really do look fine this
chilly morning.
<P align=justify>
    On my bed lies a new book that our worried librarian gave me. I haven't
managed to 
read it yet. I did take a quick look at the author's biography. In some
books, the author's 
life story is more interesting that the contents. A remarkable, eccentric
writer can grab 
you instantly at first sight. Someone whose life falls into three clear,
distinct periods. 
Childhood and youth to the age of 20, with a few unsuccessful stabs at
writing; then 20 
years of hard work and fruitful production; and when he is 40, by my
reckoning, childless 
and prey to dark moods, he abandons himself to his beloved family, which
leads him to 
shelter in a closed institution. There, miraculously, he becomes a hero as
the days and 
years go by. Riches and security are his within the walls. He passed the
years in good 
health, never suffering a serious illness till the day he dies.
<P align=justify>
    How did he maintain his body through all those long years? What
preserved his spirit 
over the course of time? Only one thing: his uncompromising regimen, a
daily routine 
that he obeyed to the letter as he would a religious ritual. before I
became ill, I was quick 
to mock a writer like that. How pleasant is it to pawn one's freedom for a
life confined to 
an institution? How did he scorn his written work and refuse to be seen
with his books? 
How did he vow never to hold a pen and magnanimously decline the work room
offered 
him by the institution's physician for his writing? Today, however, it is
easier for me to 
respect and even admire him. The way he found precisely the right moment in
which to 
sever a way of life he no longer desired. 
<P align=justify>
    How he aimed, fired and didn't miss. Exactly on the day when he
abandoned himself 
to his family, which placed him within the walls, that is the moment he
realized how vapid 
his writing till then had been and how vain were his literary aspirations.
I bow to his 
greatness of spirit in that submission. he struck at the right moment and
didn't leave 
even a single empty day in his life. and if the plan for his new life had
been revealed to 
him one night, he wouldn't have walked to the mirror above his sink the
very next 
morning after finishing his exhausting breathing exercises. he would have
surrendered 
himself instead with raised hands to the eternal ritual of an exacting
regimen.
<P align=justify>
     Yes, I can understand him now. More than that, I can taste some of his
twisted 
pleasures. Without taking a small step towards the other side, no one can
understand 
the exhilaration he can feel from meticulous attention to a daily regimen's
smallest 
details, the satisfaction both spiritual and physical from submitting to a
timetable, the joy 
of humbling oneself before the passage of minutes and the ticking of
seconds. True, 
others, those who remain outside the walls, will shake their heads at him.
"A broken 
man", they'll say of him. A loser, someone who yielded to the terror of
life. But I, who am I 
to judge him? I see him worshiping the narrow confines of his room. I see
hi gliding over 
the floor, on his face a look of absolute bliss from the humility of
obedience.
<P align=justify>
     I'm not as flawless as he. I still stray frequently from my schedule.
I've never been his 
kind of perfectionist. Careless I  was born and careless I remain. But even
I, for all that, 
have started counting my steps when I rush to the dining room early in the
morning to 
perform a daily ceremony: taking the morning newspaper from the rack and
carrying a 
bowl of sweet porridge to my room.
