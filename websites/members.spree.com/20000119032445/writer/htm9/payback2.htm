We parted as abruptly as we had met. The men of Shaya's
                              battalion were summoned on the loudspeakers to their buses. I
                              accompanied him to the parking lot. Camped far apart, we
                              wouldn't meet during the maneuvers. He called to me through the
                              window of the bus and made me swear that my first book would
                              be written and published by the time we met again. His
                              neglected mustache drooped over his lips and the eternal
                              cigarette burned between his fingers. He brushed the hair from
                              his eyes, smiled at me and waved goodbye with no idea how his
                              words had disturbed me. The convoy of buses set out in the
                              summer afternoon heat. The desert swallowed it in shafts of dust
                              and shimmering light. A few moments later, every-thing settled
                              down and no sign of the column could be seen. 
<BR><P>Shaya's comments had brewed in me such a storm that I could
                              think of nothing else. How had he divined what it was that
                              secret-ly never ceased to torment me? The stories with which I
                              had regaled our outfit, the word-pictures I painted at night when
                              we kidded around in our long barracks after a march, the
                              impressions I did of the way our officers spoke, even in our
                              commander's presence, "That all testified with the strength of
                              100 witnesses that you were born to wield an author's pen,"
                              Shaya's words echoed in my ears. "I was sure of that even then,
                              and that's why I never doubted for a moment that you had put 10
                              books under your belt a long time ago." I can't say just how many
                              years I bore within me Shaya Barak's pointed question. I'm
                              certain, however, that his question, and the kindness and
                              affection that had prompted it, set in motion for me thoughts and
                              actions that ripened into my first composition. His unwavering
                              faith in my talent, his pride in our friendship, his child-like
                              amazement at anything I did, all did something for me that no
                              others, even people far closer to me than he, had done. <BR><BR><P><B>B. At the kibbutz headquarters snack bar </B><BR><P>
I sat at a table with Yeshayahu Barak at the snack bar in the
                              United Kibbutz Movement headquarters in Tel Aviv. He gnawed
                              at the edges of the mustache. Did his lopsided mustache
                              conceal a birth mark? Did it screen an ugly mole beneath his
                              nose? I remembered clearly how, chewing with his lower l, he
                              lapped up the last of his drinks. He would dip his handlebars into
                              the cup, on purpose it seemed, as though slobbering were a
                              natural part of his drink-ing, wait a few minutes while some drops
                              rolled off the strands of his mustache, and then suck them up one
                              by one. He did this very loudly, breathing hard, as if this slurping
                              gave him a sublime pleasure. It was just like that time, many
                              years before, when I had first observed this strange habit and
                              told him that it was unsightly. Was this show specially for my
                              benefit? Had he dredged up this quirk from years gone by just for
                              me? Did he wish to impress me with a hint of his new inner
                              strength, as if to say, "Even if I am a mid-level functionary in the
                              UKM offices, here I'm still master of my body and soul"? 
<BR><P>We met on a boulevard near Kikar Atarim. I was walking arm in
                              arm with Nicole, a young American poet staying at my house for
                              one surprised-filled summer. We had roved through museums to
                              exhaus-tion and returned that afternoon to her rented room. I was
                              jittery and acted on impulse, while she was easy-going by nature.
                              My impatience annoyed her. She hopped into the shower and
                              put on her bathing suit. Then we left for the beach, where she
                              rested her head on my knee and dreamed aloud of her future.
                              The coast was deserted at this season. I tired of her reveries and
                              begged her to get up so we could go back. As enthusiastically
                              as she described for me the life ahead of her, her studies and
                              her writing, I could depict for her my own future veering away
                              from me in an unforeseen direction, her imminent return to the
                              United States, the two of us torn apart, our chance to unite
                              missed. Everything that sparked in her the joy of promise pricked
                              me with the pain of separation. I told her all this, but only in a
                              nutshell, for I didn't want to be infected by her overwrought state.
                              She grumbled that I would make something of my life too, if I
                              burst out of the cage into which I had crawled to let myself feel
                              more and act more freely. <BR><P>

                              We rose from our nest in the warm sand. She dressed while I
                              brushed off grains that had stuck to the back of her lovely neck.
                              From behind, I gave her a belated hug, but she resisted and
                              slipped out of my hands, as if beholden to the clear command of
                              her body ordering her to sever the rash and empty physical bond
                              between us. We slowly climbed the steps from the beach,
                              walked the length of the new promenade and turned onto the
                              boulevard. And there I heard Shaya calling my name with
                              undisguised elation. Oblivious of Nicole on my arm and the faint
                              halo of soured love encircling us, he pounced on me and insisted
                              that I drop into the UKM offices with him. He had a cubicle there,
                              a sort of office, and the coffee at the snack bar next door was
                              always hot and ready to drink. I introduced him to Nicole. The
                              meeting had caught me off guard. I felt uncomfortable and
                              sensed that Shaya did too. Nicole, however, took a youngster's
                              delight in my friend Shaya. In an instant, all reserve between us
                              melted away and we escorted Nicole to her room. 
<BR><P>"Excuse me, Shaya," I said, "I want to see Nicole off by myself." 

                       <BR><P>       "Sure," he replied. "Say goodbye. I'll wait for you here." 

                          <BR><P>    I faced her in the chilly stairwell. She pushed away my hand,
                              rejecting the lips I offered and my body quivering through and
                              through for hers. I too knew that everything between us was over
                              but, like a little boy who can't stop sucking a candy, so I craved
                              her sweet pleasures and couldn't restrain myself though I knew all
                              too well that I had to stop. Now, when she implored me to leave
                              her alone, and I was obliged to let her ascend the stairs to her
                              apartment on the third floor, I wasn't doing the decent thing. I
                              simply couldn't control my body. Just one more brief caress,
                              another kiss, a final, wet lick of her salty skin
<BR><P>Our words flew past us. We both knew they were hollow. There
                              would be no more secret calls from secluded phone booths, no
                              more letters invariably concluded with the cute pictures she drew,
                              no more notes scribbled in her distinctive script and pressed into
                              the books she borrowed from me. There would be no more
                              outings in the last light before sunset and no more steamy,
                              breath-stopping clinches in "our" path through the rushes on the
                              bank by the bridge. 

                            <BR><P>  I slowly dropped my hand from her back as she turned up the
                              stairs. "Write to me, Nicole," I bade her. "I always look forward to
                              your letters." She promised to correspond, even to send me
                              recordings of her poems. If I didn't understand some of the
                              obscure words in her verse, I could still appreciate the unique
                              way she chanted them. "Now go," I heard her voice at the top of
                              the stairs. "Your friend is waiting for you outside."  <BR><P>

 I returned to Yeshayahu Barak killing time by the stone wall. He
                              was leaning back, chain smoking just as he had when we were
                              boys in the army. Fine plumes of smoke, streaming through his
                              mustache like twin rivers, converged above his head in a single
                              limpid cloud. "At our age," he intoned gravely, "it doesn't pay to
                              get stuck in these affairs. They end with a lot of heartache." 
<BR><P>"These American girls can make anyone's head spin," I
                              an-swered. "Anyway, it's all over between us. Nicole is flying
                              back to the United States tonight." But deep within me, I
                              cherished her promise that we might meet again the following
                              summer, when she had to return to finish some translation
                              projects. Still, our relations had been fundamentally altered. We
                              would never be close again. The most I could hope for was to
                              preserve our good fellow-ship. Please, let it be so. I sighed
                              aloud, took a deep breath, put a cheerful expression on my face
                              and said to Shaya, "Lead on to the snack bar at the UKM
                              offices." As I followed him, I never looked back towards the
                              window of Nicole's room always opened to the sea. <BR><P>
"By the way," said Shaya, "I saw your childrens' stories in the
                              kiddie paper I read to my son. You see, I was right. You were
                              meant to be an author." He reminded me of our chance
                              encounter at the army canteen in El-Arish some years earlier.
                              "Why did you deny everything? You were writing even then,
                              weren't you?" I remember-ed my distress at his pointed
                              questions and the quizzical looks his buddies had cast me, the
                              shame suddenly overtaking me like the flush on an adolescent's
                              cheek and how I had squirmed under their gaze, wanting nothing
                              more than to flee at once to some place far away. <BR><P>

                              "After the newspaper stories will come the book. Then another
                              and another. Soon you won't be very far from the 10 books we
                              talked about." During the course of this high-spirited chatter full
                              of assurances, he showed me his small room at the UKM
                              head-quarters. "I knew right away you'd become an author. I just
                              knew it from thefirst time we talked. Didn't you feel it?" <BR><P>

                              "Enough, Shaya," I said. "Whether I'm a writer or not, what counts
                              is that your children enjoyed the stories. As for what the future
                              might bring, I can't say." As we sat at the snack bar, Shaya
                              ordered coffee and sandwich-es, joked with the counterman and
                              shouted out greetings to friends. He suddenly recalled a caper
                              we had pulled years before, when we tricked our commanding
                              officer, ignored his order and set off on an unauthorized leave.
                              "Why don't you write about that? How we switched shirts and
                              papers to fool the military police if we got caught? Remember?
                              What a wild night. We were picked up finally by an army guard, a
                              real stickler, who threw us into his wagon and drove to the MP
                              building. You remember, don't you? But the wagon slowed down
                              at one point. That's when we plucked up our courage, jumped off
                              and got away in the dark streets. We hiked back to camp,
                              singing and laughing all the way until the sun came up. Don't you
                              remember how promising life seemed then?" Shaya asked.
                              "Sometime you'll write about that night, too, right?" I never
                              imagined that Shaya, too, was soon to leave me. Saying
                              goodbye to Nicole was enough for me that day. I hadn't the
                              strength for yet another separation. <BR><P><BR><BR><CENTER><B>C. At the aid station </B></CENTER><BR><P>
I met Yeshayahu Barak for the last time at the divisional
                              reconnaissance battalion's aid station. battalion's physician,
                              needed immediately at the station, quickly came to an
                              agreement with me: if I delivered him speedily but safely, he
                              would exempt me from the evacuation work. He jammed a
                              helmet over his head and made space beside the driver inside
                              the cramped armored compart-ment. Shells exploded along the
                              road. From time to time, streak-ing jets dived in bombing runs on
                              the convoy. After one errant attack, I banged my head on the cab
                              of the old half-track. When I looked up, I saw that nature's
                              creatures carried on their lives despite the explosions. Frogs
                              hopped madly over the pitted route. Lizards lounged on warm
                              rocks. Meadow saffrons bloomed in a soft, mauve glow. Far to
                              the west, beyond the smoke and scorched tracts of basalt,
                              sparkled the Sea of Galilee. <BR><BR><BR>
