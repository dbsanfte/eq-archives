SELECTED POEMS BY JOHN BIRKBECK<BR>
( A WRITERS CHOICE CONTRIBUTOR)<BR>
$ 12.00<BR>
ORDER FROM : jbirkbeck@hotmail.com<BR>

<FONT size="-1"><P align=justify>John's work reminds me of a Zen saying- that you can never step in the same river twice. (Because as with everything the river is constantly changing and becoming new all the time). So it is with John's poetry- it will present new and differing meanings, patterns, and images with each reading.

<P align=justify>He writes as he feels- not to some prescribed form or method but simply as he is.
Longitudes is a delightful read that you'll wish to share over and over again. My favorite line is from the poem The One-Legged Hopping Man- "In a world of the misbegotten, perfection is seen as error…"

ISBN: 0312203543<BR>

<FONT size="-1"><P align=justify>As most of my readers know I am very passionate about human rights, and especially about Native American rights, so it should come as no surprise that I was honored when Harvey Arden asked me to review this book.
<P align=justify>I have posted several poems by Trudi Blue regarding Leonard's case, signed petitions, etc. But I think perhaps the most political act I can offer is to let the word out about this wonderful book.
<P align=justify>It starts with a description of the horrendous way in which Leonard's case was (mis) handled- written by the former Attorney General of the U.S. Ramsey Clark.
Then as you sit and contemplate the rage you would feel if a relative or friend, or perhaps you yourself were railroaded in the same manner- you hear Leonard's voice resonate from inside Leavenworth. It is not filled with hate but with optimism and hope. He describes how he has invoked the Sun Dance in which
pain is used to provide access to a more transient reality.  He explores his own suffering and describes the lessons it can teach.
<P align=justify>Many American people rose up to get Nelson Mandela out of prison - half a world away, while most of those same voices have remained silent in the case of Peltier who sits among us in Kansas. I'm not sure if these voices are stilled because "we, the people" just don't know the story- or more probably, they are silent because we hate to look in our own backyard.

<P align=justify>Buy this book. Read it and learn from it. Buy it for Christmas presents. Help get the word out.

<FONT size="+1"><FONT color="#008000">ALL FLOWERS DIE<BR>
A NOVEL BY ANDREW K. STONE<BR>
<A href=" http://www.sotherebooks.com">ORDER FROM</A><BR>
Read the first chapter free on the web site above<BR><BR>
<FONT size="-1">And a short exert-<BR><P align=justify>
Why should there be just one answer...?" asks Phiz Tarleton, the hero of All Flowers Die. Phiz, also known as "The Optiontunist" due to his passionately inquisitive nature, is in search of all life's                      options. But when his eager questioning leads to his teacher's fatal heart attack, he blames himself for cutting short the options of  another. Greatly affected by the tragedy, Phiz carefully manipulates
 his destiny to position himself to preach the importance of grasping  all that life has to offer. By becoming a successful musician, he  attempts to use his fame to spread this message. But when                                    circumstances beyond his control thwart his plan, Phiz's mission takes a devastating turn, resulting in his most poignant gift and  ultimate sacrifice.

<P align=justify>For a first novel this book is pleasingly well done. The character development is outstanding, the plotline enticing, and the story is delightfully thought provoking without appearing to be so. As you read the story you find yourself questioning some thought patterns that are inside your head, though the story does not read like a non-fiction self help book- it could well provide that result.

<P align=justify>Andrew has done a marvelous job in presenting this story, you will find that you take some of Phiz Tarleton with you and perhaps you'll be on the lookout for the ever elusive, everlasting  gobstopper.

A NOVEL BY ALBERT RUSSO<BR>
<A href="HTTP://WWW.XLIBRIS.COM">ORDER FROM: </A>HTTP://WWW.XLIBRIS.COM</FONT><BR><P align=justify>

<FONT size="-1">A hilarious, irreverent romp through the life of a child of the 90's!
Set in Paris and Northern Italy the work shows us the world through the eyes of Zapinette, a little girl who is smart, quick-witted, accepting and dazzling. Russo's use of slang language and spelling is just plain fun!
The book is done in the stream of consciousness of a child and jumps from subject to subject providing a very detailed, if not explainable, roadmap through a child's thought process.
<P align=justify>
A fun and enjoyable book. Give yourself and a friend a smile- buy and share this work!</FONT>

<p align=justify>Review by David Alexander, author and guest editor of the anthology "Death
and Venice", published by The Literary Review.

<P align=justify>    On the road to the 20th century the German poet Heinrich Heine wrote,
"Give me a mask and I'll join the masquerade." At the turn of the 21st
century, Albert Russo has written Zapinette Video, a novel that is an
acerbically witty commentary on fin-de-siecle human foibles, which are
dissected with clinical precision, diabolical humor and something of the
grand satirical style of Voltaire or Montaigne. Russo's mask in this
particular masquerade is the story's protagonist, a precocious preteen
named Esmeralda McInnerny, who's been nicknamed "Zapinette" by the novel's
other main character, her Uncle Alberic, called "Berky" by his inventive
niece.
   <P align=justify> Voltaire wrote that to crush "the Infamy" of his time "it must first be
rendered ridiculous." Our era's Infamy, like that of any age, is founded on
hypocrisy. It is this that Russo ably attacks with Pasquinading relish from
the first page to the last by donning his mask of a young Franco-American
girl and commenting on the world she sees around her as she rambles through
it in the company of her uncle.
    <P align=justify>The novel is not long on plot but doesn't need to be any more so than
past novels of its kind, among which I would include Mailer's "Why Are We
in Vietnam?" and Nabakov's "Lolita". Nor have Russo's past works relied
strongly on plot as engines to drive the narrative. On the contrary,
Russo's approach has been to take simple situations and then dismantle them
to see what turns the hidden gears. In the process the reader often has
shocking peeks into the clockwork mechanisms that underlie much of what we
take to be reality. Behind the face of the timepiece may lurk a clandestine
listening device. Within the marble skin of the Greek statue, a Venusian
praying mantis waits to devour. The bard behind the Zapinette mask strips
the masks from other less noble forms of artifice and lays bear the
sometimes ugly subterranean truth.
    <P align=justify>For those who would like a quick precis: Esmeralda is the favorite
niece of her "Unky" Berky, who works for the French post office in a not
clearly defined capacity (we gather he is some type of supervisor with much
free time on his hands). She has been dubbed "Zapinette" because of her
fondness for zapping her way through televisual media, from Nintendo games
to rock videos. In many ways Zapinette's narrative is a form of
self-generated rock video, the stream of consciousness by which she
perceives the world. This, of course, connects to the book's title and sums
up the style in which the book is written, but it's also a commentary on
the way we more and more tend to view the world around us as a pastiche of
disconnected and ambiguous images and sound bites that flash past our minds
in an ever-accelerating kaleidoscope that seems to simultaneously energize
and enervate.
<P align=justify>
    But back to the plot -- Uncle Alberic is a native of Monza, Italy, and
although superficially Francofied from his years of living in Paris, he
nevertheless remains Italianate below the waterline. Alberic's longing for
home forms the basis for the middle part of the book, where Zapinette and
her uncle leave Paris on a tour of Italy. This gives Alberic's young charge
lavish opportunities to lampoon some of the bastions of Western cultural
tradition, from the Vatican to art film.
    <P align=justify>The book's other two main characters are Zapinette's mother, Laura, and
her live-in lover, Firmin, who has recently fathered a child by Laura.
Laura, who is Berky's sister, owns and operates a Parisian beauty parlor.
She is a staunch feminist (or "felinist" in Zapinette-speak, about which
more momentarily) who has a don't-tread-on-me attitude when it comes to
men. This attitude is one reason why Zapinette's father is not in the
picture -- he was a casualty of Laura's wrath some years before, leaving
the American-born daughter in the care of her Parisian mother while going
off to seek his fortune in the Amazon.
   <P align=justify> One of the devices Russo uses to make his point and to carry the
narrative is the unending stream of Malapropisms, or more properly,
"Zap-apropisms," that emerge from the mouth of this not-so-innocent young
girl. They come rapid-fire, like a hail of machinegun bullets; they come in
neo-Joycean flashes that wriggle and jump in the narrative stream like
darting fish from the thought-dreams of Leopold Bloom striding through an
Icarian Dublin. Should you chance to hook one of these delicious little
minnows and roast it on the spit of your mind, you may never think the same
again. My favorite Zap-apropism is "fonda-mentalist," which makes me think
of Jane under an Ayatollah's turban, bearded and with eyes darkly ablaze.
   <P align=justify> Be warned, Zapinette's gems of insouciant wit tend to become
infectious. This wise-child's deceptively worldly innocence takes the
entire gamut of human endeavor in its compass. Hardly anyone or anything
escapes unscathed.  Michael Jackson, Vittorio de Sica, Freddy Mercury, Mao
Zedong, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bill and Hill, the Pope, Fidel Castro, and
even Jesus of Nazareth all come under Zapinette's delightfully zany fire as
she "zaps" from topic to topic in an irrepressible flux. Interspersed with
Zapinette's
first-person narrative and meta-portmanteau words are periodic Ripov
stories, short-shorts that offer paradoxical and whimsical commentary on
the rest of the book (Zapinette explains that Unky Berky pens these stories
during slack time at La Poste).
    <P align=justify>Although the novel was originally written in French, Russo has
skillfully turned it into American English in a translation that must
surely be tantamount to a complete re-writing, since it's unlikely that the
American-style idiomatic prose of the English version could have been
reproduced directly from a French original. Russo's command of the American
idiom is always on the mark, as is his keen eye for sham in its many
permutations.  Zapinette Video is the prose equivalent of the millennium
angel pin -- just the thing to take your mind off the Y2K bug as you hit
the ground running toward the technicolor dawn of the 21st century.
