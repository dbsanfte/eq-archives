She walked two more blocks.  It was just as she was walking across the parking lot toward the store entrance, the  sign shining brightly above her, the full moon beyond bathing the night in nocturnal splendor, that she saw the primer gray Oldsmobile parked in front of the store. Instinctively, she tensed.  The body of the car was dented from bumper to bumper, and she noticed a spider-web crack in the passenger window on the driver's side and a black  pentagram on the door below.  She observed   that no one was inside the car and that the driver's window was rolled down or missing.  <P align=justify>
When she pushed open the glass door and stepped inside the store, she was struck by  total silence. Usually, at all hours of the day and night in the store, a radio or a television was blaring, filling the air with music or the sound of people talking.  But the TV situated behind the counter  to her left  was not on; the radio, where ever it was kept, was also silent.  Glancing around the store, she could not see Miguel, the old clerk who generally took the night shift. Looking up and down the aisles, she suddenly saw in her mind's eye the image of Miguel being shot in the forehead.  The revelation hit her like a crow bar.<P align=justify>  
Sick to her soul, she froze in the middle of the store, no longer interested in buying something to eat or drink,  knowing  something was wrong, trying to reassure herself that Miguel had simply gone to the restroom,  felt  in her gut that she must get out of the store.  Then she remembered that she was armed, and  stood her ground. 
Buried  in the deadly silence,  muffled voices  came from the back.  It was like listening to people  talk  under water.  "Anyone here?" she asked, apprehensive, her stomach tightening.  As she awaited a reply, she could no longer hear the muffled voices, so she called again, this time more loudly, "Is anyone here?  Anyone back there?"  She felt herself going numb as she heard a muffled shout coming from the back followed by two popping sounds.  She thought first of fireworks and knew Miguel  had been shot.   <P align=justify>
	 Frightened, now moving to the door, she heard someone coming from the back, the sound of heavy footsteps running to the front.  It was just as she pushed open the door that she looked back, saw a heavy-set man wearing a beard and a hunting cap come out of the back and yell at her to stop.  She noticed the man was missing his front teeth and carried a handgun.  Misty knew there would  be another man as well and so ran out of the store, sprinting  in the direction of her house as the two men pushed through the glass door and yelled at her to stop.  <P align=justify>
Unable to help herself, she stopped just at the corner, turned, and looked.  "Hey, little girl; hey, Misty," one of them bellowed; Misty could see him clear as day as she stopped and looked back, saw that the speaker was taller than the other man, bald like Jason, and had a silver tooth in the front of his mouth.  As the tall man smiled and nodded at his grinning heavy-set companion, Misty knew, somehow, that she was  possibly facing her last night; certainly, this was the end of something.  She turned and began running  as the  men jumped in the car, started it noisily, backed up screeching, and pulled out of the store parking lot after her.
<P align=justify>	Misty ran for her life, moving like the wind up the sidewalk that led to her house three blocks away, but she was no match for the car. The two men caught  her within seconds, the car pulling into the  driveway immediately in front of her and blocking her way and the two men jumping out and pursuing her, the tall one immediately on her, grabbing her by the shoulder, throwing an arm around her neck, telling her "Relax, Misty  baby," bearing her to the pavement under the weight of his body.  Wondering if she were dreaming, she screamed wildly, asking herself why no one responded, crying out finally to Jesus, feeling a blow to the back of her head and closing her eyes and yelling "Jesus!  Jesus! Jesus!" as she sensed herself  engulfed in swirling, muddy darkness. <P align=justify> 
Then, she saw in her mind's eye a blue phosphorescent glow, the man from the visions in the center, watching her, his eyes sorrowful, reaching out to her and  touching her, filling her with strength to endure, as suddenly  full consciousness returned and she felt herself being dragged along the street,   someone holding one of her arms, felt herself dropped, and opened her eyes.<P align=justify>  
The short, heavy-set man stood over her, pointing a shot gun at her face.  She was going to end her life in the middle of her own street, late at night.  "Say your last, Misty, you little bitch," the man growled,   as Misty heard the tall man shuffling up  and saw him too staring down at her.  Both men laughed and paused, and the stocky man lowered the shotgun. <P align=justify>
Something is wrong with their eyes, Misty  thought to herself, and looking more closely saw that  the irises  of the men's eyes   looked like fragments of broken glass, each piece reflecting  darkness.   She watched the short man turn his head for an instant and  grin wickedly at his taller companion. She knew then she had just met the Devil.  <P align=justify>
As if given a second chance, Misty remembered Jason's gun, slipped her hand into her pocket, felt cold steel, felt for and released the safety(as Jason had told her to do when, weeks ago, at the firing range, he had explained the workings of the gun),   withdrew the piece, pointed it at the chest of the bearded man just as he turned back towards her.<P align=justify> 
It was like a freeze-frame, all three figures immobilized at the point of action, beautiful background music provided.  Somewhere in the distance,   she could hear Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata."  Not blinking, suddenly realizing that she was not afraid to take the life of another, not afraid to die, she pulled the trigger. 
Blood banging furiously in her brain, numbed by rage and fright, she did not hear the weapon's explosion, did feel the gun nearly leap out of her hand, and searching for the bullet hole in the bearded man's chest turned Jason's gun on the taller man and without looking directly  fired once, twice, three times.  As the larger man fell backwards, the crack of the gun now audible, she smiled at the bearded  man, who stood dazed before her, holding the shotgun to his side; without giving it a second thought, she pointed Jason's weapon at the man's head, and fired once, sure that she had hit the mark. The man spun, the top of his head taken off, spun again and fell three feet from Misty. <P align=justify>
Temporarily ecstatic, the sonata still playing in her mind, Misty stood, pointed the gun at the stocky man's twitching body,  pulled the trigger again, watched the body jump as the bullet penetrated the body, and then stopped and waited.  Now towering over the bodies of the men who would surely have raped her and taken her life, Misty waited and waited, for what she was not sure, saw the pools of blood gathering under the bodies, saw out of the corner of her eye lights in the houses across the street go on, heard sirens in the distance, tossed the gun into a thick hedge that grew in the  yard next to the driveway where the car had stopped, and stepping over the two bodies ran the remaining two blocks to her home.
<P align=justify>When she entered her house, Misty's mind cleared. She figured  that, shortly, the police would be banging on her door, then hauling her away for questioning.     As she walked numbly  into the dark kitchen to call Jason on the phone, she heard movement upstairs, knew that one or both of her parents were out of bed, inwardly gave thanks that her parents were all right, then heard her mother shout frantically form the top of the stairs, "Misty???  Misty?  Is that you honey?  Is that you?" She knew the fear in her mother's voice, had heard it before, and instinctively responded to calm her mother. 
<P align=justify>"It's just me, Mom," Misty said, exhausted now, forcing herself   to sound normal  while, her hand now trembling, she reached for the phone.  "Everything's fine, Mom, just fine," she said in a voice that she knew sounded cold as steel, and she wondered, as she knew her mother listened at the top of the stairs, how her parents could not know something dreadful had just happened.
<P align=justify>"Honey," came the voice, "there's two police cars down the street.  At least, I think it's two.  Lights are flashing everywhere. Your father thought he heard some shots."  As she had done before, Misty's occasionally hysterical mother was asking her daughter for directions.  
<P align=justify>"Go back to bed, Mom," Misty replied, not sure why she didn't tell her mother that she had just shot two men in cold blood, almost without blinking, and was now waiting for the police to  take her away. "Mom, I'm all right. Everything is all right, " she added, even calmer this time as she heard her mother respond, "OK, honey, just so long as you're here.  Your dad and me were worried. Just worried is all. You know how we are." For Misty, preserving her parents' safety and peace of mind meant protecting those same elements in her.<P align=justify>
"Nothing to worry about, folks," Misty said, fighting to remain calm, not wanting to upset her mother or make her father sicker, then lifting the phone and punching Jason's number.  <P align=justify>
Sure that her mother would  go back to bed, Misty heard the phone ring four times before she got the recording: "Hello, world, this is Jason.  I'm away from my desk right now, but at the beep if you could be so kind...." She could hear the Beethoven piece in the background. <P align=justify>
When the recording finished and signaled for her to leave her message,  she spoke: "Jason, you need to come and get your gun. You left it with me. Something bad has happened." <P align=justify>
She waited for an instant, hoping Jason would pick up the phone, sure that he was lying in bed next to the phone, listening to the message. <P align=justify>
Putting the phone gently back in place, Misty  remembered that she had thrown the gun away, knew the weapon would be found soon,  and wondered what was taking the police so long.  Glancing out a side window, she saw that the moon was setting.<P align=justify>
She waited through the night, sitting next to the phone, gazing out the living room window at the street, watching night slowly give way to  dawn.  Around 6:30, sure that her usually peaceful existence would not be disrupted for at least another day,  she arose and walked slowly upstairs, not certain what would happen, wondering  what she would learn in religion class today, knew that eventually she would become front page headlines, suspected  that her life from this point on would never be the same.<BR><CENTER><HR><P align=justify></CENTER>
<U>V.</U> 	Jason rolled over in bed, listened, froze when he heard Misty say something bad had happened. <P align=justify>
Sitting up in bed in his one-room apartment, Jason reached for the pack of cigarettes on his night stand.  Always, it seemed, he needed a smoke. Now was no exception. He wondered if he should pray for Misty, thought better of it, then lit up. Inhaling deeply, he pressed the button on his CD player and waited for Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata" to fill the room and lull him back to sleep and forgetfulness.<P align=justify>
In the darkness, wrapped in soft sounds, he remembered what Misty had said hours before as he had impatiently listened in her bedroom, one thing on his mind.  He recalled thinking, as he had dressed in Misty's room after the sex, that he should pick up his gun and take it with him.  But something in his girl friend's voice had set off an alarm, and he knew even then, inexplicably, that something wicked was coming Misty's way.  And he knew she would have to face it alone, perhaps soon, so he had left the weapon, fully loaded, next to her bed.
Since leaving Bible college, Jason had fought the  frequent intuitions of evil that, once again,  he had felt that evening with Misty.  All his life, he'd had haunting premonitions, and if they were from God, he thought as he inhaled more smoke, he wished God would just leave him the hell alone.  If God were real, he knew, then he was indeed Misty's keeper; hell, he was everyone's keeper.  Jason knew from the tone of her voice-numbed, as if spoken by a dead person-that something terrible had happened, that he was supposed to know about it and do something about it,  and that he, somehow, was now permanently part of it.  <P align=justify>
Forcefully, even angrily exhaling smoke out his open window, looking at the  moon sinking towards the horizon, he realized that his inaction, his failure to remain with Misty when he  sensed disaster,  had permanently complicated his life.  Flipping his cigarette out the window and lying back to resume sleep, letting Beethoven's sounds   drown thought, he had no idea where to go from here.  His mind and soul churning within him,  he wasn't sure if he should even care about Misty. Wondering  if he would eventually have to marry her, he didn't want to care.
