	<br><br>
	<FONT FACE="Franklin Gothic Book" COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1">
	<P>How many of us will allow their own fellow human beings to control their financial destiny?  Do so by raising your hands.  Why do I say this?  I say this because the attitude of the New York Giants seems to be:  I decide what should be published and what goes into the slush pile. I don't care how you feel."  They think they have the right to decide what you can publish and what goes into the slush pile.  What right do they have to make that decision for you?  They have the right to one thing and that is the amount of money that goes into a book project.
</P>


<P>I must have to remind you that I am not here to condemn the commercial publishers.  Rather, I am here to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth of what is happening in the publishing industry as I know it.
</P>


<U>Growing interest in Self-Publishing
</U>


<P>There is a revolution sweeping across the continental United States.  This revolution is spilling into Canada and Great Britain.  Very soon it will find its way into Eastern Europe.  Publishing companies are merging and as a result, many editors and chief executives of these companies, literary agents and other professionals are getting interested in publishing their own books.  By the year 2000, the number of self-publishers has been estimated to 40,000. I still believe in the words of Dr. Robert H. Schuller of the Crystal Cathedral, Garden Grove, California and author of "Move Ahead With Possibility Thinking" when he said, "What do you believe in?  Put it in writing."  In his book, "The Publish It Yourself Handbook," Bill Henderson says:  "The right to publish what you believe in is an essential of any democracy. It is not to be denied by any government, local censorship or publishing conglomerates”
</P>


<U>So, who am I addressing?
</U>


<P>I am addressing undergraduate and graduate students, magazine and newspaper editors, war veterans, doctors, attorneys, teachers, chiropractors, retirees, football and soccer stars, talk show hosts and hostesses, military men and women, and other professionals.
</P>


<P>In fact, I am trying to reach anyone who has a talent, experience, a special training, skills to knowledge to share with others.
</P>

<B>
Yes, There Could Be A Book In You</B>



<P>There are thousands out there who have very, very wonderful ideas and wish they could have these in print.  What do these people need?  They need motivation.  They need someone to talk to.  They also need someone to listen to. They need someone who can tell them:  "It can be done."  I did it with Magic of Numbers.  You too can do the same.  You never know until you try.  That's what positive thinking is all about.
</P>


<U>Why not consider collaboration?</U>

<P>If you know what to write and you don't know how to put your ideas together, or don't have enough discipline to articulate your ideas, consider what is called  collaboration?
</P>


<U>What does it take To Self-Publish?</U>



<P>First, you must have an idea.  You've got to have a consumable viewpoint.  If you can present even an old-fashioned idea in a new manner, and it becomes fascinating to people, you have got a winner
</P>
<P>Self-publishing is a normal activity.
</P>
<P>Self-publishing is normal.  It is as normal as taking your breakfast.  It also has a history.  Self-publishing worked years ago for writers like Mark Twain, Upton Sinclair, James Joyce and a list of other impressive writers.  Self-publishing is an outlet to express a viewpoint that could not have been possible otherwise.
</P>

<B>
Yours Could Be Another Book</B>



<P>Do you think there is a need for another book like yours in the market?  It could be as controversial as "The Final Exit" by Dr. Humphrey Derek.  If your answer is "yes", what are you waiting for?  Do what I did.  What did I do? I self-published.  I did it with Magic of Numbers.  Again, I have said this somewhere, you too can do the same.  The father of American psychology, professor William James said:  "Human beings use only ten per cent of their mental capacities."  The big question is:  If we use only ten percent of our mental abilities, where is the rest?  We are talking of 90%.
</P>

<P>
The rest is untapped.<BR>
<BR>
The rest is dormant.
<BR>
The rest is latent. 
<BR>
The rest is hidden</P>

<P>The human mind, I think, is the last frontier after space.  It is also a gold mine.  It is your responsibility to do the digging, and this digging could be done by setting challenging and realistic goals.
</P>
<U>Set a goal and publish that book.
</U>


<P>Do not even just talk about it.  What happens when you set goals?  When you set goals you face challenges.  When you face challenges you discover your hidden potential and using them you can transform your goals into physical reality.  With excitement, goal setting, patience, and a consumable viewpoint, your dream of publishing your own book could be realized.
</P>
