ABOUT POETRY <br>
<font size=4>

<br>


Poetry is the language of the soul. It encourages each of us, writer and<br>
reader alike, to be true to the depths of our beings. It guides us to the <br>
places where the goddess resides in our psyche.<br><br>

Although there generally is little financial reward to having poetry <br>
published, the reward of seeing our own truths and deepest form of<br>
expression in print is often enough for many of us.  I believe these <br>
remunereations are totally significant and worthwhile. <br><br>

There is a poet inside us all, a visionary whose  voice deserves an outlet.<br>
A soul whose truth needs to be validated, appreciated, and enjoyed by <br>
others. <br><br>



            ABOUT POETRY<br><br>

In the academic world there are many debates, many arguments, and many<br>
viewpoints as to what makes a piece of work "poetry". If you investigate,<br>
you'll find that there are as many different definitions of poetry as there<br>
are definers. At a Writer's Choice we have our own criteria as to what<br>
defines poetry.<br><br>

Meter and rhyme, or the lack thereof, do not determine for us what is or<br>
is not a "good" poem. We believe that poetry cannot be evaluated totally<br>
on the basis of its form, pattern, or even technique, even though all of<br>
these components are important in composing and evaluating it.<br><br>

 We are a diverse lot, each of us truly unique in this world. We urge our<br>
writers to listen to their inner voices, to develop, and celebrate that<br>
uniqueness - to sing life as it is for you. Nurture your innermost <br>
impulses; free yourself from the restrictions of specific forms and <br>
techniques. Freeing yourself from these constraints will keep you out of<br>
the ruts and will bring you to a higher understanding of what poetry is<br>
and is not.<br><br>

Just as a book is not made by its cover, poetry is not made by its form<br>
or technique. The words are the real book, as they are the real poem. <br>
Form and technique are merely outer wrappings for the essence of the poem.<br>
True, if the wrapping doesn't fit quite right, the poem will suffer. But<br>
in adopting this attitude,you will see that simply mastering the techniques<br>
of form is not the same as mastering the art of writing poetry. <br><br>



             EVALUATING POETRY<br><br>

The real strength of a poem lies in its metaphorical power. In the poem's<br>
intrinsic ability to imply or suggest, rather than stating directly. A <br>
strong poem should invoke emotion in the reader, it should communicate a <br>
depth of feeling, a small hint of truth to the reader.<br><br>

One question will lead to the true measure of a poem, no matter the style<br>
or  form - " How well is it said?" If what the poem has to say is muddled,<br>
trite, vague, ungrammatical, or garbled, then the poem fails. If what it<br>
has to say is conveyed in a pompous, precious, overly sentimental,<br>
commonplace, or obsolete language, then the poem fails. The problem is<br> 
often grammatical. New poets tend to start at the wrong end of the<br>
spectrum, striving to write great poetry before learning the basic elements<br>
of grammar, sentence structure, punctuation, word usage, and spelling.<br><br>

If a poem is a web of fragmented sentences, misspelled or misused words,<br>
overworked adjectives, weak passive verbs; if it is oversupplied with<br>
"so", "and", or it is cluttered with the decaying bones of dead language,<br>
then it fails.<br><br>

Learn the rules of grammar. Break them by choice - not out of ignorance.<br><br>

Is It Worth Saying?? We all know that love can hurt, wound, mortify,<br>
uplift, invigorate, turn lives around, overjoy, etc. We all know that<br>
nature is overwhelming, beautiful, frightening, stirring, and so on. If<br>
we examine ourselves honestly we will see that even truths like these are<br>
no defense in the realm of poetry. Although truth is no defense for poetry,<br>
poetry must deal with truth. We must tell it indirectly, figuratively,<br>
metaphorically, symbolically . It must be overrun with imagination, born of<br>
originality, and live in honesty.<br><br>
