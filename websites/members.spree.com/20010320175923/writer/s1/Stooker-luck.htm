	<P>How dare you ever say such things as:</P>

<P>"With my luck . . ."</P>

<P>"If it wasn't for bad luck I wouldn't have any luck at 
all."</P>

<P>"I never win anything."</P>

<P>You are lucky! You are a winner! You've already hit the
jackpot in the greatest lottery of all.</P>

<P>What's more, I can prove it.</P>

<P>Before I do that, however, let's get something clear. 
If you did get lucky and win the lottery, don't you 
agree that your life would still have problems? 
Of course. Don't misunderstand -- the problems of 
wealth are much better than the problems of poverty.</P>

<P>So you would have problems, and you could handle them, right? I mean,
choosing the proper tax accountant is a
problem you'd have to put some effort into. Yet it 
beats the problem of looking for a job when you're 
close to bankruptcy.</P>

<P>If you are experiencing a lot of financial problems, 
I know you know you could handle the problems 
of wealth.</P> 

<P>So, just why do I claim I can prove that each and 
every person reading this article is luckier than 
even the one man who has won TWO lotto jackpots?</P>

<p>Here:<br>

Almost all women produce a fertile ovum about once 
every four weeks for about 30 or so years of their 
lives, except for pregnancies and major illnesses etc. </P>
<P>
Let's say 30 years to keep the numbers simple and 
rounded. 30 X 12 equals approximately 360 ovum per 
woman in her lifetime.</P>

<P>Men produce millions of sperm. Nobody really knows 
what a "normal" sperm count is. It's currently a 
subject of controversy, because some studies 
suggest it is going down. However, a low figure 
is 20 million per milliliter (and don't ask me 
how many milliliters are in one ejaculation).</P>

<P>All of these numbers of course vary from person 
to person and from time to time.</P>

<P>Let's say men produce on average 20 million 
spermazoa a day from teens to sixties, 50 years.</P>

<P>50 X 365 X 20 million = 3,650 million sperm in a 
lifetime.</P>

<P>My point so far is, in their lifetime, every 
fertile adult produces 1/2 of LOTS of potential 
people.</P>

<P>Every separate combination of sperm and ovum is 
a genetically separate person, or else all sisters 
and brothers would be twins.</P>

<P>When you consider twins, triplets etc, you get many 
more potential people, but let's keep this simple.</P>

<P>There are currently about 6 billion people alive on 
this planet. Let's say that 2 billion are children 
and elderly. There're approximately 4 billion 
adults producing sperm and ovum.</P>

<P>Every fertile woman could have sex with every 
fertile man and conceive a baby.</P>

<P>Multiply the about 2 billion men by the about 2 
billion women by the 3650 million sperm by the 
360 ovum.</P>

<P>That means that the total POSSIBLE genetic human 
beings that people alive today could produce if 
they wanted to, are a number so high it's 
mind-boggling.</P>

<P>The one out of 75 million odds of winning the 
PowerBall are a sure thing in comparison.</P>

<P>And that's just the people alive today. Many billions 
of people are now dead or the elderly we took 
out of the equation.</P>

<P>If we had a time machine, we could take any fertile 
man who ever lived to have sex with any fertile 
woman who ever lived and produce children.</P>

<P>OK, we could never compute these odds exactly because 
we'll never know the exact number of people who have 
ever lived or the exact number of ovum or sperm 
they produced in their lifetimes or the exact 
number of children they could have in total 
together.</P>

<P>Yet the total is obviously staggering. The numbers 
of potential human beings who could have lived 
is more than astronomical.</P>

<P>Yes, billions of human beings have lived and died 
and 6 billion are alive now and that's a lot 
of people, yet compared to the number of POSSIBLE 
people, it's a TINY drop in the ocean.</P>

<P>You are one of those lucky people. </P>

<P>So am I.</P> 

<P>Let's be thankful. The moment your father's sperm 
fertilized your mother's ovum, you won a jackpot 
against odds too huge to grasp.</P>

<P>What would the trillion trillions of potential 
people who never made it even that far give to 
know even a few short hours of life?</P>

<P>If those gazillion billions of potential people 
who will never know even a second of existence 
could talk, do you think they would tell you 
that they'd gladly take on the problems of 
living life?</P>

<P>Just as you'd gladly take on the problems of 
being a millionaire? </P>

<P>I think they'd all agree that the problems of 
life are a fair trade for the pleasures we are 
allowed to experience.</P>

<P>Just as I think you'd agree that the problems of 
owning wealth are a fair trade for freedom and 
luxuries you could buy with it.</P>

<P>You now appreciate that you are a lot luckier than 
you used to feel, don't you?</P>
