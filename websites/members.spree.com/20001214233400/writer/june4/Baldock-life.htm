<DIV ALIGN="right"><STRONG>A Somer Afternoon</STRONG></DIV>
<BR>
<P>After an hour of play time with my two-year old one busy afternoon, I committed one of the <I>Seven Deadly Parenting Sins</I>.   I fell asleep with my toddler at nap time.</P>		
<P>Anyone who has ever committed this particular parenting faux pas recognizes the ramifications.  Safety aside, there are any number of ills that can befall the parent(s) of an unsupervised two-year old.  More specifically, whatever you don't want a toddler to do will be exactly what he/she will do if left unsupervised for even a short period of time.  I'm fairly sure it's a 'law.'</P>
<P>That said, a quick check of the premises revealed nothing unflushable had been flushed down the toilet, no tubs or sinks were overflowing their bounds and my wall coverings hadn't been amended to include scribbling.  </P>
<P>Experience huge sigh of relief.  Now enter one brightly beaming two-year old stating, "I good girl, mommy."  Still reeling from my near miss, I absent-mindedly mumbled something to the effect of "Sure you're mommy's good girl," which elicited a more emphatic response: "I good girl, mommy." Again I responded something affirmative. </P>
<P>	Frustrated, Somersett grabbed my shirt tail with both little hands and practically shouted up at me: "I GOOD GIRL, mommy ... I potty."</P>
<P>Ever seen that little light bulb cartoonists use to depict warnings? At that precise moment, it came on in my head.  Dragging Somer behind me in my haste, I rushed to the bathroom for a check of her plastic potty chair.   Nothing.  A big, fat <I>zero.</I></P>
<P>Wondering how she could possibly have climbed that high, I still checked the porcelain bowl as an afterthought.  There was nothing there, either.  Exiting the bathroom, I got down on Somer's level and reaffirmed "Yes, you are mommy's good girl, sweetheart, but maybe you only <I>dreamed</I> you pottied because there is nothing in the potty chair."</P>
<P>Tears welled up in Somer's eyes.  One final time she stated: "I good girl, mommy."  Suddenly bells and whistles went off in my brain!  A great fear rose in my belly and, trying to remain calm, I reiterated, "<I>Okay</I>, you are mommy's good girl but just <I>where</I> did you go potty?"</P>
<P>	Brightening, Somer took me gently by the hand and led me to her bedroom.  Standing in front of the dresser, she puffed out her tiny chest and pointed proudly to the bottom drawer.  Cautiously, I pulled it out.  There, nestled among her socks and training pants, was the runny result of her good behavior.</P>
<P>I didn't know whether to laugh or cry ...</P>
<BR><BR><DIV ALIGN="right"><STRONG>The Hamster Fiasco</STRONG></DIV>
<BR>
<P>	... which is probably how my parents felt after the hamster fiasco.  We already owned a dachshund named Charlie, and as a result, my parents nixed requests over the years for additional pets.  This time was different, though.  In the first place, I had neither bought nor been given the forbidden pet.  It scooted across the driveway where my friends and I were choosing up sides for a game of Red Rover and I scooped it up without consideration for what it was or whether it might bite.  Holding it close while I peered into my hands, I discovered a small brown and white hamster, which I promptly named Bebe.  I then took Bebe home, housed her temporarily in a trash can, and began earnestly preparing the opening statement for the case I would later present to my parents.  First I would argue that a small rodent couldn't possibly be as much trouble as a fat dachshund.  Next I would appeal to my parents sensitivity by explaining that if I hadn't rescued her, she'd likely have ended up road kill.  I would even offer to buy a cage and other supplies from my meager allowance and I would promise to be 100% responsible for Bebe's care -- which was sure to get Mom's and Dad's attention if not for the dig about my allowance, then because initially I had been 100% responsible for Charlie.  Finally, I would throw my aces into the game by explaining that my younger brother, Bobby, had already grown attached to our new pet.  Naively, my parents would agree.  Bobby was never denied anything.</P>
<P>	I won the preliminary and on Saturday, Daddy drove the family to the pet store to purchase a cage.  It was soon apparent that my allowance was not sufficient to cover the cost of hamster supplies, which were <I>legion</I>.  I would need a cage, water bottle, den, bedding material, hamster gym and self-contained exercise ball for rolling around the house at hamster leisure.  It was also apparent that in agreeing to let me keep Bebe, Mom and Dad had upset status quo and nothing would do for righting that wrong except let my younger sister, Becky, pick out a hamster as well.  Mom and Dad were skeptical.  What had started as a rescue attempt on behalf of one small rodent was rapidly escalating.  In desperation, I pitched Beck's argument: the hamsters would cohabitate, Beck and I would pool our resources for the necessary supplies and Mom and Dad wouldn't have to finance a short-term loan until we got our next allowance.  Our parents acquiesced.  Beck picked out a plump orange furball that looked like a 'Henry.'</P>		
<P>We got the hamsters home and set up housekeeping for Henry and  Bebe.  After a couple of days observing them sleeping and eating and eating and sleeping (hamsters don't do much except race their exercise wheels at 3:00 in the morning), trouble broke out when I teased Becky about the bustle-looking thingy located on what appeared to be Henry's behind. </P>
<P>	Mom and Dad made a more thorough check of the hamsters and discovered other differences.  Bebe wasn't just smaller and a different color.  She had longer, softer hair than Henry, also.  She didn't have a bustle-looking thingy, either.  In our ignorance, we had caged dissimilar breeds!  Mom called the pet store and described the difference in color, size and fur texture to an indifferent clerk who informed us that Bebe was likely what in the business is termed a 'fancy' hamster and Henry was likely the plain vanilla variety.  The clerk said they would cohabit well in spite of their differences and Beck didn't particularly mind that Henry was a generic equivalent.</P>
<P>	Unfortunately, nobody thought to mention the bustle-looking thingy to the clerk and that turned out to be the most significant difference in the hamsters.  "Sure" they cohabited nicely!  They were mixed sexes!  In short order Bebe gave birth to 13 offspring!</P>
<P>If you've never seen a baby hamster, try to avoid the experience.  They are incredibly ugly.  They are so ugly, in fact, in the hairless and pink stage, that hysterical mothers will sometimes cannibalize their young rather than endure the sight of them.</P>
<P>Imagine the irreversible psychological damage to an impressionable, pre-pubescent 11-year old when she peers into the cage and spies a baby hamster wriggling from mama hamster's mouth.  Corresponding shrieks from Rebekah had Mom running into the laundry room to investigate.</P>
<P>There, on top of the warm, clothes-dryer turned birthing room, a quick count revealed that psycho-Bebe had consumed four babies. In stupefied horror, we watched Henry eat two more before, spurred to action, Dad removed him from the cage and Mom dashed to the kitchen to place a call to the vet.  The vet assured Mom we had done right in removing Henry from the cage.  He further mentioned that in spite of the danger Bebe presented to their small selves, the remaining babies could not survive her removal.  He even suggested we cover the cage with a towel and hope for the best.  Perhaps, he encouraged, the rampage was over.</P>
<P>	Of the remaining seven babies, one died.  Maybe it was defective because Bebe shoved it out of the nest, where (of course) it expired. I grew to hate Bebe for being such a rotten mother and vowed to get rid of her at the first opportunity.  I also vowed to keep one of the babies instead, but Mom and Dad, already ticked off by the whole scenario, vetoed this idea.  Furthermore, they insisted Beck and I find homes for the remaining babies as soon as they were weaned.  To add insult to injury, Daddy threatened to take any leftovers to the pet store where we knew they would  probably end up snake food.</P>
<P>Despite erstwhile efforts on our part, Beck and I found homes for only two of the baby hamsters.  Distraught at the thought of Daddy taking the remaining four to the pet store, and knowing Mom was the bigger softie, we prevailed upon her for a solution.  She encouraged us to release the rest in the back yard.</P>
<P>It seemed a humane gesture at the time, but almost immediately the next-door neighbor's tabby, Ginger, jumped the fence, caught the escaping prisoners and sanctioned the death penalty upon each and every one.</P>
<P>	We buried the remains in a shoe box and Becky spoke a few tearful words of comfort over the little gravesite which Charlie, the devious cur, promptly dug up.  He ate the rotting carcasses and Beck and I were so mad at him that from that day forward, we would have nothing whatsoever to do with him.</P>
<P>We also boycotted the next-door neighbor's cat.  Whenever Ginger ventured into our yard, we squirted her with one of Bobby's arsenal of water guns.   Actually, our brother had been squirting her long before this incident and that probably accounts for her retaliatory action, but that is another story.</P>
<BR><DIV ALIGN="right"><STRONG><I>Stand Up Comic Bombs in Gilead</I></STRONG></DIV>
<BR>
<P>	Even though I was born in the early 50's, both my parents worked outside the home.  They also had full social calendars and, as a result, there were frequent conflicts.  Thus it happened that Mom's weekly choir practice fell during Dad's city council meetings, and that's the primary reason my sister and I started singing in the adult choir as early adolescents.  Having us with her in the choir assured Mom we had adequate supervision.  Besides, Beck has a gorgeous voice.  Me?  I can mouth words with relative ease. </P>
<P>	Those were the 'official' reasons we sang in the choir, but Beck and I had our own considerations which were entirely selfish: if we weren't singing, we'd have to entertain Mom's later-life offspring (that ratty little kid we grudgingly acknowledged as our brother) who got dragged to choir practice rather than hire a baby sitter.  Not that my parents weren't willing!  The problem was finding a sitter who would <I>agree</I> to watch Bobby.</P>
<P>Week after week Bobby sat in the third or fourth pew racing toy cars or making faces at Beck and me.  Mostly he made faces.  It was a mortal sin to snicker, sneeze or whisper during Mr. Parker's practices and Bobby delighted in getting us into trouble if he could.  He had an uncanny sense of timing regarding when to shove a pencil up his nose to get our attention without chancing Mom's.  At least most of the time he did.  If Mom happened to catch him and silence him with one of those near-legendary <I>Mom Looks</I> that are part and parcel of every mom's portfolio, all would likely be forgotten by the time choir practice was over, so he risked it.  He'd have risked it even if he'd gotten a thrashing when we got home, however, since the <I>Theory of Sibling Rivalry</I>, states it's okay to risk corporal punishment in order to get a sibling into equal or greater trouble in the process.  Think 'buy one, get one free' rule of commerce and you'll understand the principle.</P>
<P>	During this period of incarceration, Bobby was learning music by osmosis.  He developed a sense of rhythm and tone well beyond precocious.  On occasion, and at the immense displeasure of Mr. Parker, he even sang snippets of songs along with the choir while we practiced.  Gradually, and unbeknownst to any of us, Bobby learned every word to each song in our repertoire  -- as evidenced on the Sunday morning that <U>Balm in Gilead</U> was scheduled as the anthem.  When the choir members rose en masse, books at the ready, every eye focused on Mr. Parker and the sanctuary hushed in eager anticipation, Bobby also rose because Daddy was out sick that morning.  There was nobody to stop him when, in a clear, child-pure soprano voice, he began exactly on cue:  "There-ere is a Bomb (pause) in Gilly-ad."</P>

<P>	Stunned, Mr. Parker turned about face to confront the offender.  Smiling cherubically, Bobby continued through to the end of the first stanza at which point he made a slight bow and sat down.  The congregation, unsure how to respond, stared in horror at first at the director, then Bobby, then back to Mr. Parker who was sputtering like a teapot in full boil.  Bobby continued to grin like a Cheshire cat.  Mom sat down to keep from fainting.  Suddenly, from the back of the sanctuary, one of the ushers let loose a loud guffaw.  Soon the entire congregation erupted into raucous laughing and clapping.  Having achieved his five minutes of fame, I expected this would not be Bobby's last foray into entertaining, and <I>I was not wrong!</I></P>

<P>Shamed, humiliated, and fearing we were no longer welcome in our home congregation, we visited other churches over the next few weeks.  At the first, Bobby pretended to be asleep with his head in Mother's lap.  During the pastor's monologue, he began barking, growling and wrestling fitfully as though experiencing a bad dream.  Dad put his hand over Bobby's mouth and carried him down a side aisle and out the back door whereupon Mother shoved him into the back seat of the car and crossed that one off our list of prospective churches.</P>
<P>At the next, despite of my parents efforts to martial his energies with quiet activities like sticker and coloring books, Bobby took advantage of a congregational recitation of the Lord's Prayer to slip onto the floor and shinny under the pews to the front of the sanctuary.  At the end of the prayer, he stood up in the first pew and launched into making faces and dancing an end zone dance, at which point Mother signaled him to the rear of the church and Daddy crossed another off our list of prospective churches.</P>
<P>In desperation, we visited outside our faith.  It was at this church that Bobby loudly proclaimed to everyone within earshot:  "but Mama, it doesn't HELP to cross your legs when you're a boy."  Mom quietly reached over and pinched the dickens out of her reprobate son.  Whereas I never dared continue misbehaving when The Pinch was applied me, and Beck would desist at least momentarily, Bobby began shrieking like a banshee: "Child abuse; child abuse!" His shrieks disrupted an infant baptism and in the process the heretofore peacefully slumbering baby also began wailing inconsolably.  Again were we banned from attendance.  Defeated, we returned to our home church in various disguise.</P>
<P>In retrospect, I think we quit visiting churches just shy of finding the perfect one.  We never visited the Catholics, for example, with whom we would surely have shared the common goal of getting Bobby into the confessional.  Confession, they say is good for the soul.  <I>They</I> say -- but then I wouldn't know.  I have never confessed my most heinous crime.</P>
<BR><STRONG><DIV ALIGN="right">T.L.B</DIV></STRONG>
<BR>
<P>I'm not sure what the statute of limitations is for a crime of the magnitude I committed.  Perhaps it has run out there is nothing left for me to worry about except dealing with my guilt (which waxes or wanes depending on the phases of the moon).  In my defense, I didn't exactly kill anybody.  Bobby only <I>wished</I> he had died.  Not that I've lost any sleep over his suffering.  I've just had a nagging fear that if I don't come forward, my deed will catch up with me of its own accord and I'll be tried for <I>Attempted Fratricide</I>.</P>
<P>.

	It's not that Bobby wasn't adored.  He came along 10 years after me and was the only boy, so of course TLB (the little brother) was adored -- just not by Becky and me.  When every  conversation with your friends contains the phrase "<I>as long as you don't have to drag TLB along</I>" (as in: "I was wondering if you'd like to go (a) skating, (b) swimming, (c) to the movies with me as long as you don't have to drag TLB along"), TLB is tantamount to a hideous swear word.  Nor did it help TLB's cause that he was blonde haired (to our auburn) blue-eyed (to our brown) or that he bore his crown of downy curls (to our board-straight, boring locks) with exceeding grace and poise.  He was, in fact, such a comely child that the family grew accustomed to being stopped by total strangers who wished to bask in the glory of his smile.  Sometimes, as well, we were stopped by total strangers seeking to ascertain who had reached out from where he was hiding under a rack of clothes in Ladies Wear to poke them in the tush with a piece of broken coat hanger, but more often than not, absolute strangers stopped whatever they were doing to lavish praise upon the little ingrate.  He came to expect it, in fact reveled in it, which did not endear him to Beck or me.
</P>
<P>	TLB didn't care what our opinion of him was, though.  Nor did he anything to ingratiate himself to his elders (ergo:<I> betters</I> ).  In fact, he did everything within his power to exasperate us.  When a beau came to sit on the good sofa and steal an occasional kiss in the living room, TLB was usually hiding within earshot hoping to garner enough scandalous information that at least a $5 payoff was needed to buy his silence.  Resentful of the privileges Beck and I had, through maturity, acquired, he would also position baseballs precariously over the door to our bedroom so that they would come crashing down on our heads and alert the entire household if we were sneaking in past curfew.  He even stored farts in a peanut butter jar, and while I have no idea what the shelf life of a canned fart is, I can state unequivocally that these were definitely ripe.  He would then wait until we dropped off to sleep to asphyxiate us.  Is it any wonder we abhorred him?</P>
<P>I've heard told "pay back is fun" and would definitely agree if Becky and I had ever given as good as we got.  The few incidences where we scored points were far too few to brag about, however, unless you account for TLB's intense dislike of condiments.</P>
<P>As the youngest (and "only boy" <I>ad nauseam</I>) TLB expected everyone in the family to defer to him.  Most people, like Mom/Dad/Grandparents, did so because they lived simply to serve Bobby and his whims.  Beck and I only deferred to him because if we didn't those other misguided souls would see we regretted it.  Needless to say, TLB always got the last ice cream sandwich, the choice piece of steak, 'shotgun' seat in the car, first pick of any multiples, the largest piece of pie (unless it was lemon, which he despised), or the cot nearest the stove on a frigid night at the deer lease.  All this besides, he could pee standing up, so we (Beck/me) loathed him with good measure.</P>
<P>I'm not sure which of us concocted the plan, or even how or why, but in typical older sister fashion one afternoon, Beck and I deferred to TLB and his heir to the throne right of alpha maleness.  One of us yelled across the house:  "If you want the last of the ice cream, you'd better hurry to the kitchen or I'm going to eat it" -- which was incentive enough for TLB to quit pulling the heads off our Barbie dolls (some kind of instinct little brothers are born with).  He came running expectantly into the kitchen, grabbed a salad spoon full of ice cream and shoved it greedily into his mouth.  Not a tablespoon, mind you, a whole half of a pair of plastic salad tongs filled to overflowing with, dare I say it?   <I>MAYONNAISE!</I></P>
<P>TLB sputtered and turned green.  He choked and spit.  He gagged and vomited and stared horrified while Beck and I laughed so hard we could scarcely breathe.  Whatever punishment awaited us at the hands of our parents, is long forgotten.  Whatever punishment we've long since forgotten, it was certainly worth it.</P>
<P>	Baseball bumps heal and noxious farts are not, with one possible exception, lethal.  TLB, on the other hand, eats sandwiches dry to this very day.  Beck and I finally succeeded in giving as good as we got - which is more than can be said for poor Monique. </P>
<BR><STRONG><DIV ALIGN="right">Monique, <I>mon deux</I></DIV></STRONG>
<BR>
<P>	Grandmother had a tiny teacup poodle named Monique which she adored, and rightly so.  Monique was petitely precious, yet quite demanding of time and attention as even the very best pets are wont to be.</P>
<P>After Grandfather's stroke, Monique came to live at our house since Grandmother had her hands full attending to Grandfather.  She also thought Monique would be happier with the robustly healthy instead of the elderly and infirmed, and already apprised of Monique's adorability, we were quite pleased to welcome her into our home.</P>
<P>From the very beginning, Monique was a delight.  She could turns flips and, if she got a running start, could even do two at once.  She was also an affectionate nurse who nuzzled beside whichever of us was sick and neurotically  mimicked symptoms of general malaise.  She would not leave the sick bed, in fact, until she had transferred the entire ailment -- ingrown toenail or menstrual cramps -- onto her small self and the 'patient' was feeling better.</P>
<P>Monique could sit up and beg, whether for a tasty morsel or a luxuriant lap, and she was very vocal -- trying her best to communicate her intent in yips and barks and growls.  She remained good natured in all situations -- even trips to the vet -- but was never happier than when riding in a boat, ears flapping in the breeze as she snapped at the spray that occasionally crossed the bow to strike full in her pixie face.  She was a giant among dogs and a dog among men for Monique, mon ami, was more than <I>just</I> a dog, she was family.  She went everywhere with us but to church since, thanks to Bobby, we were still on probationary status there.</P>
<P>Accustomed as she was to being taken wherever we were going, Monique felt no trepidation whatsoever on the day Bobby decided to climb the Mimosa with her stuffed inside his shirt.  Nor might she have suspected he intended her harm.  Even if she had, she would surely have sacrificed all in Lassie-like dedication.  She was committed to the family, but she was loyal and true <I>to her thimble of a heart</I> -- to Bobby alone.  He was her sun; her moon; her very stars.  It would never have occurred to her to question his intent to haul her 15 feet into a tree.</P>
<P>Unfortunately for Monique, Bobby was a curious child forever engaging in scientific experimentation.  He once cleared the house in the middle of the night when he tried to cook toast in a slide projector.  Daddy, smelling smoke, evacuated everyone to the front yard where we stood conspicuously in our night clothes until everything was sorted out.  Bobby was made to promise the next time he felt like a late-night snack he would go to the refrigerator.  Another time Bobby decided to see how far a properly motivated frog can jump by measuring a 'regular' jump.  He then measured an 'enhanced' jump (he poked the frog in the butt with a stick), and finally measured an 'inspired' jump by holding a purloined cigarette lighter to the frog's behind.  I will leave it to you to imagine under which circumstances a frog jumps farthest!</P>
<P>On the day Bobby hauled Monique into the Mimosa, he was hell bent on determining if a dropped dog  lands -- from whatever height you drop it -- on its feet like a cat.  He had already prepped for the experiment by dropping Monique off the couch and bed successfully and needed only to confirm his theory one final time before publishing the results.  Thus it was that, extending his arms through the branches for a clear shot, Bobby let go of Monique.</P>
<P>Monique's swan dive resulted in a broken leg.  The the broken leg resulted in a rather large bill from the vet.  Bobby was picketed by animal rights activists and getting picketed by animal rights activists resulted in his experimental findings never being published.  This has made it difficult for Bobby to defend his methodology at family gatherings where the story is repeated.  Not that he doesn't have a trump card he can play anytime he needs to save face at these gatherings -- he can always change the subject to the story of LaVona's failed attempt to fry chicken.</P>

<BR>
<P>I hadn't originally intended to mention by name the daughter to which this story refers.  The truth of the situation is embarrassment enough.  I thought I would just go on record as stating that Cindy and Somer are accomplished chefs and then swear, <I>under oath</I> if necessary, that I've asked the kids not to disturb me at work unless it is a real emergency (i.e. profuse bleeding or prolonged unconsciousness).  It's not that I really care if they call and break up the monotony so much as I need to give lip service to the rule to make my boss happy.</P>
<P>On this particular afternoon, I answered the phone in my best business-professional voice.  It didn't take caller I.D. to realize LaVona was on the line.  LaVona is the only one who cracks up every time she hears my business-professional voice.  The giggles were a dead give away.</P>
<P>"This better be important" I said loudly enough for my boss to overhear, then conspiratorially "okay, what's up?!"</P>
<P>	Recently married, you could practically hear LaVona smiling into the phone.  THAT recently married, she was -- where everything is still hearts and roses and you've yet to notice he leaves hair in the sink when he shaves every morning.</P>
<P>"I'm trying to fry chicken as a surprise for Dan this evening," she started.  Stifling my initial response, which was "honey, if it's even EDIBLE, Dan will be surprised," I said instead "... and?"</P>
<P>"And it's not getting brown" she continued.</P>
	<P>The following conversation -- or a reasonable facsimile -- ensued:</P>
<P>	Me:  "Maybe your grease isn't hot enough."</P>
	<P>LaVona:  "Grease?  I'm supposed to have grease in the skillet?"</P>
	<P>Me, incredulously:  "Yes.  At least enough to cover the chicken.  Take it out of the skillet and set it aside while your grease gets hot."
	</P><P>LaVona:  "What kind of grease?"</P>
	<P>Me (sarcastically):  "Do you have any baby oil?"  Then, realizing she might think I was serious:  "I'm kidding.  You'll need vegetable oil or shortening."
</P>	<P>LaVona:  "Shortening?  What's wrong with leaving the chicken the length it is?  Can you hold for a minute while I go to the pantry?"
</P>	<P>Me:  "Why don't you call me back if the grease doesn't solve your problem?"</P>
<P>LaVona:  "Couldn't you just hold for a minute until I see what happens?"</P>

<P>Me, sighing:  "LaVona, it's going to take more than a minute for your grease to get hot and I'm in the middle of transcribing dictation."</P>
<P>LaVona:  "Oh."</P>
<P>	I hung up the phone and got back to my transcription -- which is <I>hands down</I>  the most fascinating aspect of my job.  ("Yeah," I'm pulling your leg, I was actually thrilled to have to stop what I was doing to answer the phone.)</P>

<P>Business-professional voice:  "Dr. Yanagisawa's office.  This is Stephanie.  May I help you?"</P>
<P>Giggles:  "It's still not getting brown."</P>
<P>Regular voice:  "Maybe your grease isn't HOT enough.  Take the chicken pieces out of the pan, turn the fire up and test whether it's hot enough on just one piece of chicken.  If it crackles, your fire is probably hot enough."</P>
<P>	LaVona, suspiciously:  "What chicken pieces?"</P>
<P>	Me, also suspiciously:  "Huh?!"</P>
	<P>LaVona:  "I bought a whole chicken."</P>
	<P>Me, once I regained my composure and could speak without laughing:  "Well that's at least PART of your problem."
</P>	<P>LaVona:  "Maybe I should order take out."</P>
<P>
	Me, noncommittally -- after all, I didn't want her to think I didn't have confidence in her ability to accomplish what every 15 year old southern girl knows by rote:  "Whatever.  I've got dictation."
</P>
<P>	<P>Buried up to my elbows in the files the next afternoon, I was truly exasperated to have to stop what I was doing to go into the next room to answer the phone.  Really!  Even though most times an interruption is a welcome respite from day in/day out monotony, at other times I am up to my elbows in the file cabinets.  In this instance:  (a) there were four people standing in the outer office listening to it ring and (b)  I only lacked a couple of charts and the filing would be caught up for the day.  Nevertheless, I caught the phone on the third ring, just as voice mail was clicking in to record the message.</P>
</P><P>Voice from inside a fishbowl:  "Dr. Yanagisawa's office.  This is Stephanie.  May I help you?"
</P>	<P>Timid Voice:  "I got a cut-up chicken, but it's still not getting brown."</P>
	<P>Me:  "Call me back.  You're on the speaker phone."</P>
	<P>I was perched to pick up on the first ring, so when 10 or more minutes had gone by with no return phone call, I telephoned LaVona.
</P>	<P>Me, irritated:  "I thought you were going to call me back."</P>
	<P>LaVona:  "I am."</P>
	<P>Me:  "Well, now you won't need to.  What's happening?"</P>
				



	
	<P>LaVona:  "I did everything exactly like you said and the chicken still isn't getting brown.
</P>	<P>Me:  "You have grease in the pan?"</P>
	<P>LaVona:  "A whole bottle of baby oil."  Then: "just kidding! -- enough Crisco to cover the pieces" (apparently she had picked up on my earlier sarcasm).
</P>	<P>Me:  "And your fire is hot enough that the chicken is crackling?"</P>
	<P>LaVona:  "It's been crackling for over an hour."</P>
	<P>Me:  "Over an hour?!  It should have been done long before that!"</P>
<P>LaVona:  "Can you hold while I go answer the doorbell?"</P>
	<P>Me:  "Sure."</P>
	<P>New Voice, laughing hysterically:  "You won't believe what LaVona's done this time!"</P>
	<P>Me:  "Cindy?"</P>
	<P>Cindy:  "Yeah, it's me.  I stopped by on my way home to see how our little newlywed is doing."
</P>	<P>Me:  "So what's up?"</P>
	<P>Cindy:  "You REALLY aren't going to believe me."</P>
	<P>Me:  "Try me."</P>
	<P>Cindy:  "She didn't batter the chicken.  No egg.  No dredging in flour."</P>
	<P>Lavona (yelling in the background):  "I thought it made it's own crispy stuff when you fried it."
</P>
	<P>Me (aside to Cindy):  "Better call Dan and tell him to bring home take out."
