	<P>When wanting to lose weight, I뭭e found that most people focus on
the food that they should or shouldn뭪 be eating.  They spend so
much time and energy focusing on the food and very little time
actually focusing on themselves.  When you focus on yourself and
take extra special care of yourself, you will be left feeling
valued and worthy as a person.  This will give you confidence and
increase your self-esteem.  It will also leave you wanting to eat
healthier foods when you take time to care for yourself.  Let뭩
take a look at caring for yourself and concentrate on pampering
you.  Firstly, give yourself permission to pamper yourself and do
what it takes to feel okay with this.  You are worthy of taking
this time for yourself and what I want for you is to believe
this.</P>

<P>What would being pampered look like to you?  If you뭨e not sure
ask yourself "What do I often say I would love to do?" and yet
many reasons come into your mind for not doing it.  Being
pampered will mean different things to each person and choose
what feels good for you.  Perhaps its:<BR>

 A massage<BR>

 some time off work to do exactly what you want
<BR>
 new hairstyle
<BR>
 bath with candles</P>

<P>When you treat yourself well and pamper yourself, you are more
likely to find that you want to treat your body well with
healthier eating and exercising.  This is why I believe that
pampering yourself is a great way to start the process towards
weight loss.  It is a much more positive approach than following
restrictive diets.</P>

<P>What would support you in being pampered?  Do you need someone to
look after the children?  If you don뭪 have the money to pay for
a massage, how about asking a friend to help?  If you feel that
you have too much to do at home, work or in your business, do you
need help in prioritising or delegating some of it.</P>

<P>Identify what you need and ask for it.  Team up with a friend,
colleague or coach to receive the support and encouragement that
you need.  Come on, you뭨e worth it !</P>

<P>Pampering yourself  releases tension and restores the balance in
your life.  When you feel more relaxed and balanced, your
approach to food is likely to be more balanced.  This is what
healthy eating is all about, finding a balance with food.</P>

<P>I can hear many of you saying that you don뭪 have the time at the
moment and when you get time you뭠l do it.  That time will
probably never come and it뭩 up to you to make the time for
yourself.  Don뭪 wait to do this, start it today.  Everything
will still go on around you and you will be more able to deal
with it after pampering yourself.</P>

<P>After pampering yourself, take a few minutes to answer these
questions.  How do you feel?  Do you feel special?  How do you
feel now about eating?  Use your answers as inspiration to commit
to pampering yourself more often.</P>
<P>
Pampering is one of the best forms of self-love and when you love
yourself in this way, eating healthily will become more natural
for you.  You will want to eat the foods that are best for your
body as you believe that you뭨e worth it.  This allows you to
move away from giving yourself a hard time and following
restrictive diets that leave you feeling a failure.</P>

<P>I뭭e found that when I뭢 tempted to eat and yet don뭪 feel hungry
it뭩 work asking myself.  What can I do that feels pampering to
me?  This often shifts my thinking away from food and on to
caring for myself.</P>

<P>You뭭e read this and thought yes this is what I want to do, now
for the tougher question.  What will it take for you to get into
action, pamper yourself  and commit to this regularly?</P>
