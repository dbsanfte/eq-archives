BUG JUNE, THE STRONGEST MAN IN CHEROKEE COUNTY<FONT size="+2"><BR>

                       
    ©  Phillip Shadoin
<FONT size="+2">
<P align=justify>

Every town and neighborhood has one.  Everybody politely listens to what
they say, shake their head to themselves, and try to change the
subject.  Every town has that one little fellow that has had a chip on
his shoulder for being too short for basketball and too light for
football.  Yet he acts as if sports was his entire life.  Rock Creek has
one of those fellows too.  His given name Robert, but his daddy called
him Bobby and his friends all called him Bug.  It was a play on his size
as well as his last name.  Instead of June Bug he was Bug June.  Bug was
on all the Rock Creek High athletic teams of his day.  But he rarely
played.  He was too short, to slow, and really, the Locals will remind
you, he wasn't very good.  His single redeeming quality was his
strength.  If strong men have the strength of ten men, Bug had the
strength of fifteen.  He was short and squat and looked more like a fire
hydrant than a fire hydrant.  And he was taken with demonstrations of
strength to anyone who dared to question his boasts.
<P align=justify>
Bug started life like all the Rock Creek boys, hunting and fishing and
getting into the kinds of trouble boys get into.  But as he grew older,
he got into different kinds of trouble.  Nothing serious mind you, just
more devious than most.  While the other boys went cow-tipping, only Bug
never caught on that you can't tip a cow over.  His not catching on led
him to believe that the reason he had so little success was he was not
trying hard enough.  So Bug snuck out every night until at last he was
successful.  Bug was twelve at the time.  When word spread of his
singular ability, the Locals would gather in an unsuspecting victim and
get them to wager that this boy couldn't knock a cow down, asleep or
awake.  And Bug would.  Over and over again.  By the time bug was
fifteen he could squat down and lift the back of pickup up high enough
to keep the wheels off the ground, which came in handy if you had a flat
tire or wanted to keep somebody from leaving.  By the time he was
sixteen, you couldn't put enough bodies in the back of that same pickup
to stop him from lifting it up.  Bug once lifted the back of Clem's
flatbed grain truck completely off the ground by squatting down until
his chin rested on the bed and shoving upward with his massive shoulders
and legs.  By the time he was seventeen, Bug was so widely known for his
strength, that the Locals couldn't get even out-of-towners to take a
bet.  He looked too imposing.
<P align=justify>
So Bug's lack of a stellar athletic career hardly deterred him from
bragging it up, especially when he had been frost-proofing.  And as he
aged, his strength waned.  Sure he was still built like a fire plug, but
he was a shadow of his former self.  Quite strong sure, but not nearly
as prodigious as he was.  When Clem's clutch on his flatbed blew out and
left him stranded on the Star Creek Road on the way back from a
delivery, it was Bug who knew just how to fix it.  Since it was a
relatively easy repair for the Locals, they decided to fix it where it
was instead of towing it back into town.  Clem picked up the parts and
Geezer Hoak, John the Liar and Big Mike loaded up Clem's pickup and up
the road they went with Bug following close behind with Rockhead and
Spud James, who since he began to speak a while back, took to hanging
around the feed store whenever he was back in town for the weekend.
<P align=justify>
When the entourage of men and equipment rolled to a stop behind the
stricken truck, Big Mike looked into the bed of Clem's truck and came to
the realization that they had everything they needed except a hydraulic
floor jack to hold the transmission up when the bell housing was removed
from the front of the clutch.
<P align=justify>
"Sonovagun.  We gotta go back to town and get it."  Big Mike has a way
with words.
<P align=justify>
"No problem," says Bug.  "I can hold it up."
<P align=justify>
"I don't think so.  It must weigh close to eight hunnerd pounds.  You
ain't near as strong as you was."
<P align=justify>
Now Bug pulls himself to his tallest five foot two and affirms, "Yeah, I
can.  You get under there and loosen 'er up, I'll hold the shifter and
keep it up until you get it blocked up and change the clutch plates."
<P align=justify>
No one, and I mean no one, thought Bug was serious.  Even in his prime,
it would have been a feat of such profound impossibility that even the
Locals would have take the bet against him.  Now they saw an opportunity
to put Bug in his place, and perhaps get some peace and quiet for a
change.
<P align=justify>
"OK," said Clem, always the one to sense the perfect moment, "I'll tell
you when it's ready."
<P align=justify>
Clem climbed under the truck and removed seven of the eight bolts
holding the two parts together.  Bug prepared himself with several cans
of frost-proofing.  When Clem calls the time, Bug straddles the shifter,
placing one foot on each side of the dashboard and grabs the shaft right
above the floor.  All the trials of youth, all the feats of strength,
all of what makes up the essence of this man has boiled down to this.
He is past his prime and does not allow himself to admit it.  He knows
he was never a great athlete, braggin' aside.  He was never popular with
the women, though he married a nice enough woman who bore him three
girls. He only had a brief and shining moment as the strongest man
around.  This is his moment of revival.  His chance at redemption.  He
tightens his grip and sets his feet.  He presses against the seat and
nods his head.<P align=justify>
Clem removes the last bolt.<P align=justify>

What happened next can hardly be told.  Clem was able to duck out from
under the falling transmission only because Bug was able to suspend it
for a second.  It went crashing to the ground with a ringing thud.  Clem
looked up at the hole the transmission left in the underside of the
truck.  Instead of seeing grease and dust, he sees a pair of hands and
plaid shirtsleeves.  Then he and everyone in the county heard the
scream.
<P align=justify>
"Pick it up, pick it up, PICK IT UP!"  Bug held that transmission up by
the gear shaft as long as he could, then gravity, weight, and age
defeated him.  His success was brief.  To the untrained eye, it was too
brief to be noted.  But it lasted long enough to save Clem's life.  Now
someone was needed to save Bug's.
<P align=justify>
Bug was caught in the oldest trap of all:  ego.  That and the hole the
shift linkage used to occupy in the floor of the flatbed.  And it was a
trap no man could escape.  There was Bug with his legs pressed against
the dashboard, his head sucked down between his knees and his arms gone
from the middle of his forearms down.  His still had a grip on the
shifter only because he didn't have enough room to let go.  He was
putting up a scary amount of noise.  But the men gathered around could
hardly hear him over the laughter.  Big Mike nearly swallowed a portion
of his beard.  Even Spud James was laughing outright at the absurd sight
of Bug with feet up and his head down, trying to chase his arms down
that little hole.
<P align=justify>
Finally they assemblage heard the pleas of Bug and took sufficient pity
to help him out.  With three men pushing from below and two more tugging
from above, and a little beer onto his arms and into his gullet, Bug was
finally set free.  Angry welts swelled on both forearms, giving him the
Popeye-after-spinach look.  Clem changed the parts in the clutch while
Bug sat on the bed of the truck and rubbed cold cans on his arms.  The
Locals left him alone.  They would only look over now and again and turn
away quickly so Bug Jones wouldn't see the grins.
<P align=justify>
The truck was repaired and Clem drove it back to town, Bug and his
cooler as his lone cargo.  An important lesson was learned that day.  It
took Bug until the bruises healed before he was bragging about the
Herculean effort it took to save Clem's life.  Of course he never said a
word around the Locals.  It wouldn't have done any good.   Nobody likes
to have to holler over laughter.
