                       <P><BR><FONT size="+1">   I tell you the story below not to play on any sympathy.
 I tell you the story simply because there is a health care emergency in this country and not enough people know.
   There is also a great misunderstanding among the general public, and even among the medical community
 regarding this disease. I report this story firsthand -- I was diagnosed with MS two years ago .It is my hope that these  links and this story will help promote change and understanding.<BR><CENTER><HR></CENTER><BR>

                                                                                       

  <P>  This time 2 years ago, (March 27th, 1997), I was diagnosed with Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis.
 I'd been feeling bad, with really strange, seemingly unrelated symptoms for over 18 months. I'd gone from doctor to doctor and most of
   them felt my symptoms were due to stress. My condition was worsening, my list of symptoms was growing longer and  stranger by the day and no diagnosis was in sight. While I knew what was happening to me was real, I didn't  report every symptom to my doctor --<I> I was afraid I would be taken for crazy</I>. <BR>
<P>I'd always had an excellent memory yet I'd find myself somewhere on campus and not know where I was- let alone why I was there. I was falling down. My hands and arms were trembling so bad I could barely hit the keys on a keyboard- handwriting was/is impossible. I drooled, my speech was slurred, I inserted the totally wrong words
into my sentences and never even realized it until that stunned look in my co-workers eye's started tipping me off.
 At one point I was rushed to the emergency room because it was thought I was having a heart attack- they could find nothing except a stress related rapid heart beat. I know now that what I experienced was an esophageal spasm- a.k.a. "The M.S. Hug".


 <BR><P>So sadly, in June of 1996, I resigned my position at Southwest Texas State University because I was feeling so dreadful and scared.


Needless to say I
  could no longer maintain a sixty hour work week. I wanted to devote all my energies on my literary agency and
  editing service - some of you may remember Bearlife Women's Writing Advocate. The business was growing
 beyond belief. I offered free evaluations which meant that between 40 and 60 manuscripts were submitted each
    week. Meanwhile I bought into the stress diagnosis, I hired more people, I worked harder, and my overall
                                        condition suffered. <BR><P>

 Then in Feburary 1997, the entire right side of my body went totally numb. I was virtually paralyzed. My GP said it
               was a pinched nerve, or some other easily explainable and treatable ailment. 
   I knew better, so I asked for either a spinal tap or an MRI -- I wanted the doctor to check for M.S . My internist
 replied that my arm was numb because I had carpal tunnel syndrome and that my leg was numb because I was
                               imagining it. <I>I had just been labeled crazy</I>. 
<BR><P>
     After I raised enough hell, she got me in to see the top neurologist in my area. Without any tests, just by
  observing my condition, he suspected immediately that I had M.S.  He was correct, but what he wasn't able to
 diagnose until after viewing the results from my MRI was a course of M.S. that is the most severely debilitating --
                                       primary progressive. 
<BR><CENTER><HR></CENTER><BR><P>
   When the hospital called my health insurance company seeking authorization for the MRI they were told my
   policy had been terminated. This was news to me since they had just accepted and paid other claims two days prior.  But,
 despite my best arguments, those of my lawyers, and even the hospital adminstration - I was effectively without
                                            insurance. 

<BR><P> The next few months were extremely difficult. I got worse, despite massive IV's of steriods and a cornucopia of
                                        other medications.
                 I could no longer work effectively and, devastingly, I had to close Bearlife in May.<BR><P>

  In April of 1998 I had finally arrived at the place where I could compensate for my growing disabilities. In discovering how to
 compensate for my illness I have learned to schedule my days to ease the symptoms and pain, and I have also
                               learned to listen to what my body tells me.
 So, needing to work to prevent total atrophy of my brain from lack of use( there's little to be done to prevent the
                       atrophy of my muscles), I opened A Writer's Choice Literary Journal.<BR><CENTER><HR></CENTER> <BR>


             <BR><P>        Basically, I want to tell all readers to LISTEN TO YOUR BODY !
                               It has ways of letting you know what's up.
                  <BR><P>      If a doctor tells you you're nuts - then find another doctor !!
         As I said, my GP refused to listen to me, she even told me entirely incorrect "facts" about MS.
 <BR><P> Don't believe that your insurance will be there forever - make certain, read your policy, call and speak to their
                                 representive if you have questions.
<BR><P> Don't believe that if you grow really ill or disabled that our government will stand by you and supply you with the
                           disabilty benefits which you have already earned.
  Don't believe that if hard times strike you, and you lose your abilty to work, lose your health coverage, and fall
                                            seriously ill
                        that most hospitals and doctors will treat you- they won't. 

                             <BR><P>       But most of all dear reader - 
                                       don't assume anything- about yourself or about another person. When you see someone who "looks perfectly normal" park in a handicapped parking place, with the proper tag or license plate- don't assume they are cheating or faking. If someone speaks to you and their speech is slurred and imperfect don't assume they are drunk or stoned. It just may not be the case at all. On the other hand, if weird things start happening to you, as I described above happened to me- don't assume you're crazy. Get it checked out.!<BR><P>
                       The thing about M.S. is this- there is no way to understand it. 
 Science does not understand it, those of us who have it certainly don't understand it. One person's M.S. is not the
                                     same as the next person's. <BR><P>

        <I> And please, please never judge your fellow beings until you have walked in their moccasins.
</I>

                                          Editor's Note:
                             I truthfully feel that I owe my life to the internet.
  <BR><P> When I was diagnosed I could find no up-to-date or reliable information about Multiple Sclerosis in the print
                                              world.
 The internet provided a wealth of the latest, most current information available, and a beautiful newsgroup which
   provided comfort and understanding. I feel certain that I could not have emotionally survived these past years
                                 without such wonderful resources. 


                               





<BR><P>
  Do you have a medical horror story? An atrocity perpetuated upon you by an HMO, an insurance provider, a
 doctor, the Social Security system, the general public who lacks understanding of disablity? Please submit your
   story to A Writer's Choice. Don't worry about style, format etc. If need be we'll help you edit it. Poetry is also
                                            welcome.

<U>Traitor </U>

you have become traitor
i look at the legs,
bloated, swollen, red beyond all recognition
weakness fighting its way past cramping muscles-
to the surface
which will be the victor this time?
bringing me again to my knees-
the atrophy, the fatigue, or yet the despair.

you have become traitor
silent army of lesions eating the way
through my gray matter, down the spine
to arise victorious in a body estranged
I look in the mirror and all i see-
huge white spots which have become my brain

you have become traitor
holding waste like gold
urine & feces witheld as if some glorious trophy
proclaiming that normal body function
is for the worthy-
not for the likes of me

you have become traitor
words and the love of language
abandoning me as a cruel lover should
sentences void of definition
concentration lost in the effort
meaning - ever illusive to me now 

you have become traitor
silently stalking preying upon my deepest joy
feeding yourself on the necrophilia of my absent orgasm
mutilating the simple beauty
of sharing my soul with my love

you have become traitor
placing sticks in my eyes
clouding my vision
taking my sight
but leaving me the image of what i have become

you have become traitor
trembling, twitching limbs
muscles pulling the marionette strings
controlling the electrical waltz
i am forced to dance alone


 you have become traitor

remember when
struggling to tie your own shoe
you longed to race headfirst into
adulthood
to be a big person
in the big world
who could eat real food
instead of strained carrots
fighting against the dreaded bath
picking out your own clothes in your head
as your mother laid out the days wear

if only and just wait until
filled your young mind
yearning to stretch into the adult realm of the big people
all the promise pulling at your toes
the roads you would travel paving your imagination
the dream of stepping sure footed into the world 
without baby steps wobbling

remember when the future was an eternity and time
an ally

no 
these memories are not yours

and can you recall when it snuck in
overtook you from behind
cloning your image into an adult
can you recall the time when you
sadly realized that childhood had faded dim
that yesterday was so very far away 
the wish had come true and adulthood was yours at long last

does the cloud of dread linger in your memory 
when you realized that you could not do it over
these memories stored away somewhere...
given in a tattered box to goodwill

the memory of these memories are all that remain with you

yet the memories are not yours

what you have left
is the vague recollection of when you could walk without falling
when words flowed easily and were the correct words
when you could feed yourself without
tremors spilling the food into your wheelchaired lap
when going to the bathroom was an inconvenience 
not a luxury
when strength flowed through your limbs and
atrophy was a word you could not define
dreams were still attainable and not the
discarded shards of a maniacal disease

disease which devours the memory cell by cell
yet refuses to digest what life was before
its grand entrance.

You look well           getting around pretty good      don't look so bad
                          must be feeling swell

I'd spit in their faces
But drooling
and spitting 
aren't compatible or harmonious

Today I am ambulatory with only one cane
instead of the usual two

Today I am not imprisoned in bed with every muscle cramping  jumping  
 dancing   twitching 
 squeezing  strangling  binding 
 constricting  jigging 
 jitterbugging (cant you feel the beat?)
Attacking       convulsing          confining

Nope not today
 only my legs are acting this way

                                    today

Today I am able to eat this fine food 
in this fine restaurant
spilling  only half of it onto my lap
as my hand tremors
searching for my mouth

             while other diners try and hide their  stares

Of course I'm feeling better

Better than you probably even

Hell…. I'm not really even sick-

It's just another trick 
                            (I am Coyote!)

Like an attempted suicide

To gain sympathy        approval
 Compassion        tenderness        mercy     
    commiseration

Today I peed in the toilet
not in my underwear        not in my boxers      
 not
 in
 my
 sweatpants

And today 
almost nearly everyone 
understood the words spilling out 
from my slurred soul
or at least they pretended to understand  
 getting  better  at pretending
they even comprehended the nonsense words
 my brain disguises as actual words
or at least they pretended to understand  
 getting  better  at pretending

Yep…today was great

<pre>
Freezing drizzle shatters against the windshield
It's difficult enough 
      for me to drive these days-
Now this
And why am I sitting at this stoplight
while little shards of slivered glass from heaven reign down upon my car
thinking about the damn Chinese and gunpowder?

Why do I even know this fact?
This disease, this malady, 
eats gargantuan bites of my brain and my spine
Hourly-
Hell I don't even know now why I am driving 
or where 
- that's gone -
 like the raindrops my wipers removed

BUT DAMN IT ALL
I know the Chinese invented gunpowder.

I don't belong to the NRA
There is no Asian blood in my heritage

I don't know what it feels like to walk without a cane
I don't know what it's like to sit through a meal without drool running down my face-
These things I knew once
  but not now
Instead
  I know that the Chinese invented gunpowder.

I sit at the light with the pellets of God's rain splashing all around
The light is green
I sit 
Others honk

I strive
 I need to believe in something
A god,
 a Buddha,
  a superior intelligence,
   an interconnectedness between all things

But need is not quite belief

The Lockhart sheriff asks:
Is there a problem here ma'am?
He studies the handicap parking tag hanging from the mirror
All I can tell him:
"The Chinese invented gunpowder"

 week of Feb.1998. Jim was turned away from some of the "best" health care facilites in central Texas
                    the first week of Feb. 1998 - for having no health insurance.
