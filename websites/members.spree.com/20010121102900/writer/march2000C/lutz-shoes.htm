William's Dancing Shoes<BR>
                       
   <FONT size="+2"> ©  Patricia J. Lutz</FONT>
<FONT size="+1"><BR><P align=justify>
Anna pulled open the closet doors with a sweeping motion as if she were making a grand entrance and stared at its contents.  The doctors, her children, the funeral director and the priest took care of everything, except the part of folding and packing William away. She knew it was time she faced the fact; William, her love, her partner of forty-three years was gone.  	<P align=justify>
She gently pulled his garments from the hangers and carefully folded them putting them in a box. Silence; the only sound was the empty hangers clicking against each other as she slid the empty ones across the rod. The last garment she whipped carelessly off the hanger, it bounced and hit the top shelf then fell to the shoe rack. Shoes. They never came into mind. She stood there frozen. What should she do with them? His golf shoes, slippers, and resting proudly above the others were his "dancing shoes" as he called them. They were chestnut, with pointed toes, a band with small holes dotted across near the toes. She lifted them up, sliding her hands into them, she held them up to examine their shine, then flipped them over, the soles were hardly worn.<P align=justify>
	"We didn't go dancing enough dear." 		<P align=justify>
	She laid the shoes in front of her, not even undoing the laces, swept her feet into the two large frames.  With the beat of her own humming, she glided across the room with short strides and then a clump almost tripping. <P align=justify>

	"No wonder you couldn't dance, it was the shoes. When did we go dancing last in these shoes William?"  Anna inched her way carefully towards the couch. "Oh yes I remember," she laughed lightly. " Oh I need to sit down William." <P align=justify>

 "It was our fortieth wedding anniversary, the kids threw us that surprise party at The Grayson House. Oh my, that was so beautiful, we had so much fun. I felt like I was twenty.  And remember we were outside, it was raining, and your feet hurt so you took off your shoes, and started dancing in the puddles… in your bare feet!"  Anna covered her mouth with her hand stifling her laughter, like an embarrassed teen. " Goodness, we were laughing so hard. She looked at him seated next to her, his sky blue eyes smiling, always smiling. "We laughed a lot William, and that's a rare thing now a days."
<P align=justify>
	"Ah listen to me, talking like you're here with me. The kids would put me away if they heard me. "<P align=justify>

	Anna fell down the stairs, wearing William's shoes and broke her hip.  She guessed the real reason they put her in the nursing home wasn't because of the stairs, but because she had to pretend she didn't know how she fell down the stairs. She had gotten very upset when she found out, her daughter had given the shoes away to a shelter. Out of all of William's things, the most precious to her were the shoes, they had his life in them.  
<P align=justify>
 	Tonight would have been their forty-fifth wedding anniversary and Anna's daughter was taking her to the symphony.  She hadn't been downtown since that night at The Grayson House. She gazed at the reflection of herself, a new dress, her hair done and alone. Nothing, she thought, ever made her look more beautiful than having William beside her. 
	<P align=justify>
Anna's daughter parked in the underground parking near the symphony. She asked Anna if she wanted to take the elevator, but Anna wanted to prove her ability to use stairs again so she declined. 
<P align=justify>
	Henry ran to the shelter covering the entrance to the underground parking, he wanted to show off his shoes, and he knew his friends would be there.
<P align=justify>
	"Look at these men," he said to one of them, as he rubbed the soft brown leather into his flannel sleeve."  "Hmm…look at these fine shoes."
<P align=justify>
	"Where'd ya git them?" 
<P align=justify>
	"At the Shelter, it was like they were just sittin there, just waitin for me!" 
<P align=justify>
	Anna let go of the railing to move around the scary looking men in front of her and as she reached the last few steps…"Ah," she yelled, placing her tiny gloved hands in front of her.
<P align=justify>
	"Mother." She could hear the fear in her daughter's voice.
<P align=justify>
	At one silent moment Anna was facing a dirty cement stair and the next she was staring at William's shoes, her shoes, their shoes. Did she pass out? Was she dreaming? 
<P align=justify>
	"Let me give you a hand young lady." A large black callused hand reached down to her, she grabbed it, and it pulled her up.

<P align=justify>	"Thank you.  Mother are you going to be okay?"

<P align=justify>	"Your shoes." She pointed at them like a child, not knowing the words to say. 

<P align=justify>	"They are fine shoes ain't they ma am? These are my dancin shoes!" He laughed doing a little shuffle. 

<P align=justify>	"You need lessons," said his friend as they laughed and slapped each other's hand. 

<P align=justify>	"Those were my husband's shoes." 

<P align=justify>	"Mother your imagining things, maybe we shouldn't go, we can go another time." 

<P align=justify>	"No, no, I am fine."

<P align=justify>	"Well then, come on and let's go to the restaurant, you can sit down, relax a little."

<P align=justify>	As Anna and her daughter began to walk away, Anna turned back to the men. "Those were my husband's shoes and he couldn't dance in them either." She smiled. 

<P align=justify>	"Would you like them back?" Asked Henry, realizing her sincerity. 

<P align=justify>	"No, no, they should be enjoyed, they should be danced in."

<P align=justify> Anna turned knowing the man needed the shoes more than she did. She looked up at the city's night sky, with it's few bright stars and whispered thank you.

<P align=justify>"Did you say something Mother?"
	<P align=justify>
"Oh… yes, what a glorious evening it is, isn't it?"
<P align=justify>
 As they walked down the busy sidewalk Anna felt beautiful again with William beside her.
