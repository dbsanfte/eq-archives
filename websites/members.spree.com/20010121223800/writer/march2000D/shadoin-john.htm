JOHN THE LIAR<FONT size="+2"><BR>

<P align=justify>
There was a time in John the Liar's life that he had a last name.  He
had the same name as his learned and respected father.  They were John
Krug the Elder and John Krug the Younger.  Every life has it's turning
points.  John the Younger was only six when he arrived at what might
very well be the most crucial turning point in his life and would
forever lose the name of John the Younger.
<P align=justify>
As had always been tradition on the Krug farm, each fall they would
gather all the sons and daughters and do the hog slaughtering.  Three
fat gilts would be slit from ear to ear and the dressed carcasses would
be disseminated to yield bacon, ham, sausage, and roasts.  Many of the
chops would be eaten over the next two days as reward for the hard,
smelly work.  The remainder would be smoked with the hams and set aside
for a midwinter treat.  The Krug farm had a cement slaughterhouse that
abutted the small dairy.  This would be scrubbed from top to bottom both
before and after the process.  This allowed the hogs to be bled and the
blood salvaged to make blood sausage.  The jowls and many of the untidy
bits would be combined and ground to make souse.  Some of the organs
would be spiced up in jauternice.  The best remaining fat would be used
to make crackling bread that could be sprinkled with salt or cinnamon
sugar for a treat.
<P align=justify>
Most of the fat would be rendered over a large fire.  The Krugs all took
turns watching the rendering vat as the fat boiled and the impurities
would need to be skimmed off.  The best fat would be made into lard and
allowed to conceal in large crockery.  The worst fat would be thrown on
the fire from time to time for amusement, just to watch it burn.  The
remaining fat would be made into lye soap.  The worst part of the hog
butchering was the lye soap.  Lye soap was used on the Klug farm for the
hands that needed the most cleaning.  They could remove blood, tractor
grease, grass stains, mildew, or mold with lye soap.  It was vicious and
it was caustic.
<P align=justify>
A six year old can find all sorts of ordinary mischief without ever
getting up from the breakfast table.  Elder and younger siblings can
both be targeted for a sneaky pinch.  The center of the cinnamon roll,
which every child knows should be saved until very last so as to savor
the best and most tender portion, might suddenly come up missing from a
neighbor's plate.  Salt might be dumped into the sugar bowl and
everyone's hot cereal except John's would be polluted to the point they
were choked down.  (A little salt won't kill you.  Eat it and don't
complain.)
<P align=justify>
So by noon each and every day, an enterprising six-year old can be a
fugitive from his own family.  It only takes a little luck and a little
planning and a high tolerance for pummeling if he was ever caught.  A
very high tolerance for pummeling.  John might set the world standard
for pummeling tolerance. Or he is a very slow learner.
<P align=justify>
Though his brothers and sisters would complain constantly, his mother
would cluck softly and wiper her hands on her apron and call to her
son.  When John would appear, dragging his feet, he would give his
mother that look that could soften butter and that little half a grin
that belonged on a riverboat gambler, not a six-year old and she would
immediately soften.  She would chastise him soundly and send him out to
weed the garden.  With all the weeding that garden received, it grew the
finest stand of Canadian Thistle in all of Cherokee County.  John was
mighty proud of that thistle patch, showing off to the preacher when he
stopped by once each month for dinner.
<P align=justify>
Back in those days, if you came from a well-to-do and small Catholic
family, you tithed and shook the father's hand at the end of service and
didn't see him again for a week.  If you were poor and came from a small
family, the Father Steinmeyer (yeah, I know) would expect to see a bit
of canned goods or several eggs on his pantry table at some point each
week in lieu of tithe.  If you happened to come from a large family and
were a little strapped for ready cash, you could expect the preacher to
grace your dinner table at least once each week.  There is no such thing
as a well-heeled, large Catholic family.  They have better sense than
that.   So John the Elder and the first Mary Krug were the gracious host
of the Catholic priest every Friday night, much to the obvious
displeasure of the scads of Krug children who resented having to clean
up and make themselves presentable right on the cusp of what should be a
glorious weekend.
<P align=justify>
The week of the hog butchering would certainly mean that there would be
pork chops for dinner on Friday evening when the father joined them.
The district's monsignor, the distinguished Monsignor Martin would often
join Father Steinmeyer at least once each quarter at the Krug household,
which in itself was a testament to the first Mary Krug's abilities in
the kitchen.
<P align=justify>
Take a six-year old on the verge of never making seven, an indulgent
mother, a hungry Father and a visiting Monsignor and something
interesting is bound to happen.  One Friday night it did.
<P align=justify>
The family was well into the main course when the back door slammed.
Immediately Mrs. Krug excused herself to intercept the late arriving
John the younger.  Six year olds of the day could seldom tell time and
very, very few who could wore wrist watches.  John was doubly
inconvenienced by the unnatural desire not to be at home and confined to
the dining room with his suffering siblings while grownups droned on and
on about corn prices, the good weather, the wheat prices, the lousy
weather, the hog prices, the rainy weather, the cattle prices, or dry
weather.  Every four years they might discuss politics or something else
equally enthralling to six year olds.  So John stumbles in as late as he
dares just filthy from head to toe, smiling broadly and holding up a
peace offering of Indian summer wild raspberries.  Nothing can soften a
mother's ire like a peace offering of wild raspberries unless it's a
fistful of wildflowers or pussy willow boughs.  Mothers can be so hard
to be bought.  Mary gives John a quick ear full as well as the fastest
sponge bath in history.  When the pantry door swung open again, John was
slicked down and freshly scrubbed and set down right into the only open
seat.  Right next to the Monsignor.
<P align=justify>
"Well little fellow, I am glad to make your acquaintance," the monsignor
asked while nodding knowingly to a nervous John the elder and the first
Mary Krug.  "Were you on some grand adventure?"
<P align=justify>
"No not really.  I was just out picking raspberries and practicing my
dirt clod throwing when I realized how late it was and hurried home.  I
would have made it too if it wasn't for the stinging nettles.  I had to
go around those."
<P align=justify>
At six years old, John the younger had already been schooled in the
proper technique of letting the bait sit quietly until it drew the
attention of an unwary fish.  Properly fished, all bait will get the
attention of something.  John wasn't disappointed.
<P align=justify>
"That sounds dangerous," the Father Steinmeyer nodded.  "I hope you
didn't find out about the nettles the hard way."
<P align=justify>
"Oh no.  I know about stinging nettles.  I didn't know about the
quicksand though."
<P align=justify>
The Monsignor turned and looked square at the young fellow at his side.
"You fell in quicksand?"
<P align=justify>
"Not me.  Those two hunters I met did."
<P align=justify>
"What two hunters?" John the elder asked.
<P align=justify>
"Those two hunters down by the willows who are stuck to their waists in
quicksand.  They said they were tracking the cougar that has been
getting after the Hoak's calves.  I told them we hadn't seen any sign of
a cougar and they should get outta that sand before they got stuck plumb
good."
<P align=justify>
"Did they get out?" asked the Monsignor.
<P align=justify>
"I don't know.  I was late for supper and I figured I'd better get home
before I got into really big trouble.  Besides, I think they might have
been poachers.  They didn't have a single good hunting dog with them and
neither one looked like he could tell a cougar from a bobcat."
<P align=justify>
"Where are they now son?"
<P align=justify>
"I reckon either up to their necks or somewhere short of the south
property line."
<P align=justify>
John the Elder, his oldest son, and the two dinner guests leapt up and
dashed for the door.  The son ran to the tack room and grab a length of
stout rope and the dinner guests grabbed the orchard ladder next to the
barn and all four took off across the pasture for Rock Creek and the
willows.  The rest of the Krugs were close behind.  When the rescue
party reached the willows, out in the middle of the sandbar were two old
hats laying sad and lonely.
<P align=justify>
"Oh my gosh!"
<P align=justify>
"Heaven's help us!"
<P align=justify>
"Mary Mother of God!"
<P align=justify>
The ladder was stretched out across the sand and the elder John Krug
shinnied out across the soft sand.  When he tried to plunge his arm in
to reach the lost men, he found the ground to hard.
<P align=justify>
"What in the world.......?"  He stood up and walked over to the hats and
picked them up and looked at them carefully.  Each was his own discarded
hats that were too filthy to wear anymore.
<P align=justify>
"Why these are my old hats.  What is going on here John?"
<P align=justify>
"Why I guess it means those two fellows were Goddammed thieves too!"
<P align=justify>
And that's when John the Liar learned how strong lye soap really was.
Especially when it was used to scrub foul language out of the mouth of a
particularly creative six-year old under the stern supervision of a
visiting monsignor.
