<P>	The mountain stood ominously, towering above her. In her head, 
the thoughts of self-doubt ran unchecked. "Who do you think you
are? You're not a mountain climber. You're not even an athlete. 
You can't do this. Go back home and start cooking dinner for John
and the kids." This was to be Anne's maiden climb to the top of
Mount Destiny. Actually, it was her first real mountain climbing 
experience altogether.</P>

<P>Anne was many things, but not a mountain climber. A wife and
mother of two beautiful little girls, she spent most of her days
climbing up and down the stairs of their home, cooking dinners
and scaling the mountains of laundry that only a growing family of
four can produce. Challenging yes, but seeming mole hills as she
gazed up toward the jagged cliffs and snow capped peak that 
appeared to touch the heavens. "I can't do this," she thought to
herself.</P>
<P>
The idea of climbing Mount Destiny sounded very exciting four
months ago. Anne had been looking for something to break the
monotony of the daily chores that came with being a domestic
engineer. She loved her family and the life they had built 
together, but she yearned for something more. She craved a 
challenge that would test her strength, not only as a woman, 
mother and wife, but as a human being. Mount Destiny was just 
the challenge, or so it seemed a few short months ago. Today 
though, even with all her preparation and training, the idea of 
climbing a mountain was more than Anne could grasp.</P>

<P>"Okay, is everybody ready," shouted Denise, the expedition 
leader. Anne slowy walked toward Denise to explain that she just
wasn't ready to climb the mountain today. What would she say,
she wondered. How could she explain that this was a little more
than she was ready for? Then she stopped. Her mind suddenly
flashed back to last year when her youngest daughter Lisa was
just learning to walk. "Come on honey, you can do it, just one 
more step," she remembered saying to Lisa.</P>

<P>The words echoed again and again in her consciousness. "Just
one more step, you can do it, just one more step." Anne looked
down at her feet. Then she looked at a spot on the ground that 
lay two feet in front of her. She stepped toward that spot. Then
she took another step and another and the next. Suddenly her
whole perspective changed. "I don't have to climb a mountain
today," she thought. "I just need to take one more step."</P>

<P>Anne no longer looked up at the huge mountain. She focused 
only two feet in front of her. Step by step, up Mount Destiny 
she ascended. She never once looked up at the peak. She knew it
was there and she knew she was headed in that direction, but 
she only focused on the next step. </P>

<P>Several hours later, Anne stood at the peak of Mount Destiny 
and gazed out over the land below. Tears filled her eyes. An
overwhelming feeling of joy and accomplishment swept her 
entire body. She had done it. She had conquered not only the
mountain but also the fear that just a few hours before had 
nearly sent her home in defeat. Step by step, Destiny was hers.</P>

<P>Are you like Anne? Do you gaze up at Destiny, hoping to 
conquer it. Do you yearn for a greater challenge - one that will 
test your strength as a human being? Perhaps you want to 
make a job change or start your own business. Maybe you'd
like to climb a mountain, further your education, begin an 
exercise program or work on improving a relationship. But - like
Anne - do you tell yourself "I can't climb this mountain, go 
home."</P>

<P>Spend this week thinking only about the next step in your climb.
Shift your focus from the entire mountain to the spot two feet 
in front of you. You don't have to climb the mountain today. Just
take one more step. Maybe that step is polishing your resume' or
visiting the library to research the business you want to begin.
You could visit the community college in your area to see what
classes might interest you. Instead of trying to run 3 miles for 
the first time, take a brisk ten minute walk around the 
neighborhood. Just take one more step.</P>

<P>We all have plenty of mountains to climb and sometimes it all
seems a little more than we're capable of doing. But step by 
step, Destiny can be conquered. Just one more step.</P>
<P>
It's your life. Create it the way you want it!</P>
