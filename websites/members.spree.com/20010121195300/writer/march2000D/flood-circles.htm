crop circles
<BR>
<P align=justify>(they dust in my mind.)
<BR><P align=justify>

My mind is a bog of fog. I can’t think straight. For some reason now I begin to think that I never could. Thoughts that I used to think mundane are now rising into the fore front of my imagination. They have this nasty tendency to plague me with useless information. Like the way the light reflects in a curve off of a black dot. The way that what someone says just doesn’t make any sense to me. The way a man cares about the rock that sits on his father’s grave and painstakingly cleans it. The way the girl that you would die to be with is the last girl that you would ask out. Or the way that some people choose to argue about that which we will never know.
<P align=justify>
Case in fact.

It’s two days before the all too defining day of the coming about of my existence.
<P align=justify>
The man named "karl" sits across the fire. He chooses his name to be presented as "karl" because he believes that he is less than everyone, but still the sum of them all. He thinks that the lack of a capital in his name makes it seem less harsh, somehow less obtusive. "karl" has a tendency to think of things in this way. He likes to go all around the point without ever getting to it.
<P align=justify>
Suzanne sits to the left of him. She is wearing a light, lacy, silken half-dress. It covers her top half to a certain extent, but none of the people around this fire mind that. She is a sight to behold and all those who see her, male or female, turn their heads with the knowledge that this is a truly beautiful woman. She is more than pure. She is almost ethereal in the light of the fire. The light dances over her half-dress and across her deep black micro-fibre, flared to cover her feet, trousers. She is the diva of any given moment. Her long tresses of silk gold hair hang freely over her shoulders. Suzanne is happy. She thinks that everything will be all right, no matter what happens. She likes to know what she can find, and find what there is to know. The fire in her deep, emerald green eyes tells of her pure and true happiness.
<P align=justify>
Keira sits to the right of "karl". She seems somewhat tired, quiet, absorbed into the things that are, and the things that were. She strums a guitar quietly. She plays her favorite tune in a soft, lulling voice that goes unnoticed to those who wouldn’t pay attention. But that is all right with her. Her brilliance is in her quietness, her depth in her song. She knows this, and those who know her soon find this out. She is the enemy of none yet is unknown to many, even to those she sees everyday. She is plain. "It’s just another lonely day, hey hey..."
<P align=justify>
Crill sits across the fire from them all. Crill has much to say, and says it whenever necessary, but a running mouth has brought trouble before and the consequences are known all too well. Crill is probably the smartest person that anyone could hope to meet. Silent when most outraged, outraged when most perplexed, and amazed at the story of a child. The simple things in life are what Crill knows and loves. Nothing is greater than the love of a child gained honestly without any false pretenses of power. This is what life is to Crill. Yet this is life that has been chosen.
<P align=justify>
"karl" finishes rolling the joint he was working on and begins on the next. One of his friends from over at another fire drops off a small baggie to him. The baggie is a bright, fluorescent orange. Inside of it there are about nine little pieces of paper. "karl" can’t tell exactly how many are in there, but that’s what he asked for, so that’s what he’s expecting. He continues rolling while swaying to the melancholy mood music provided by Keira.
<P align=justify>
The music stops and "karl" is still rolling on. He’s got a lot to finish. Suzanne: "Hey..." she indicate her desire for the attention of Keira with a thrust of her exquisite jaw.
<P align=justify>
Keira: "Yeah?"
<P align=justify>
Suzanne: "Were you out at Keith’s yesterday?"
<P align=justify>
Keira: "Yeah... why?"
<P align=justify>
Suzanne: "Did he mention the trip at all? Deice told me that he was maybe gonna bail. Whazzup with that?"
<P align=justify>
Keira shrugs softly: "He might not be able to get the cash. That’s all."
<P align=justify>
Suzanne: "Shitty." Suzanne lolls her head around on her neck for a second, pauses with a look of sheer concentration on her face, then: "What about you? Are you still gonna go without him? It was kinda yours and his idea..."
<P align=justify>
Keira stares vacantly at Suzanne for a moment or two. Her expression of absolute calm doesn’t flinch one bit: "Yeah, I guess. I mean, I do really wanna go, so I might as well." Her expression begins to get more intense. She throws her hair back and to the left. Her eyebrows pick up further onto her forehead to lift some on the shadows that fall on her face to reveal a soft, child-like expression. The brilliance of the three-quarter moon above and the soft red glow of the fire reveal the lovely round face that once was hidden by her dark brown hair: "Yeah, actually I’m pretty psyched. It’s gonna be a blast!"
<P align=justify>
Suzanne: "Definitely!"
<P align=justify>
"karl":
<P align=justify> "It is going to kick some major ass!" "karl" says this in a lisping voice, accentuating every word.
<P align=justify>
Suzanne: "And tonight is gonna be even better."
<P align=justify>
"karl" finally finishes his rolling. He presents three long and fat joints. They appear to have been crafted by a machine. The ends are flat, they are perfectly round, and the paper-box filters at the end curl infinitely inwards catching every last roach that might try to venture it’s way into their inhaler’s lungs. He sets them down on a rock beside him and picks up the baggie. He reaches behind himself and rustles around for a moment in the ice filled cooler. He pulls out a long-necked fat-bottomed bottle of wine. This another one of "karl’s" little eccentricities. Wine is much more classy, therefore better in every way. The flavor of the alcohol is understated and the texture much more refined. Especially with a "silly-strong" kind like this. He cracks the top open of the Baby Duck. He sets it down between his legs and opens the baggie’s zip-locked mouth. He offers it to everyone around the fire, and everyone takes out their share.
<P align=justify>
Suzanne places her two little pieces of paper under her tongue and begins to shake her head. Her divine tresses wave around her head freely with her movements. Keira places her two bits into her mouth, one to each cheek. She likes it more that way. She doesn’t know why. She just does. Then she picks up her guitar and begins to play softly. "Does anybody really know what time it is? Does anybody really care?" "karl" places his three pieces under his tongue and lies back staring up at the stars. Crill does the same.
<P align=justify>
Time passes slowly and ever onwards until Keira finishes her song. She pauses briefly, opens her mouth as if to ask a question, then stops and begins fingering out "Street Spirit" and swaying slowly. Half way through the song, "karl" grabs one of the joints, reaches into his pocket and pulls out a worn Zippo lighter with the emblem of a pentagram inscribed into the front. He then whets the joint in his mouth.
<P align=justify>
"karl": 
<P align=justify>"I hereby baptize this joint in the name of all those who just don’t give a shit." He flicks the lid of the Zippo open and strikes the flint. Twice it doesn’t light. Then it blazes into life and he places the flat end of the splif into the blue-black part of the flame. He sucks hard on it and hauls the smoke into his lungs. He exhales and takes his turn, then passes it off to Suzanne.
<P align=justify>
"karl": <P align=justify>"Hey! Hoot hoot pass! hoot hoot pass! Don’t fuck with the rules, man!"

<P align=justify>Suzanne: "fuck off..." She jerkingly lets the air out of her lungs and passes the blunt off to Crill. The joint passes around the circle until it’s spent. "karl" then baptizes the next joint and passes it around. This one is dedicated to "all those who give a shit, but just don’t care to do anything about it". The third is eventually given life and is declared to be "for all those who give a shit and kick some ass for it!" This is "karl’s" holy triumvirate of life.
<P align=justify>
All drink heavily of the super fruity wine.
<P align=justify>
Suzanne: "Hey... guys... What the hell is up with crop circles? Man... Shit..." She giggles softly to her self and falls back and looks straight up to the star-lit sky. She sighs: "All I wanna know is everything..."
<P align=justify>
Crill: "This shit is starting to kick in. I’m getting some fierce tracers man..."
<P align=justify>
"karl":<P align=justify> "Aww...." His eyes flick about quickly in their sockets. Pupils dilate rapidly inwards into small specks and then return to normal for a moment, and then they go completely haywire. A slow smile begins to cross his face. The muscles over his cheek bones begin to clench.
<P align=justify>
Suzanne looks over at Keira who is sitting completely still: "How are you?" She laughs loudly and then covers her mouth, surprised at the sudden noise coming from herself.
<P align=justify>
Keira: "I just want to go away so badly..." A single tear creeps into her right eye. The last sight she ever sees is the perfect white curve of light reflecting off of Suzanne’s perfect emerald-green eyes.
