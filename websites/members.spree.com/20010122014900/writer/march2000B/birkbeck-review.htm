 BEFORE IT’S LIGHT<BR>
                  New Poems<BR>
               by Lyn Lifshin<BR>

     Black Sparrow Press, 1999, 250 pp.<BR>
     ISBN 1-57423-1114-6  (paperback)  $16.00<BR>
     ISBN 1-57423-1115-4   (cloth trade)  $ 25.00<BR>
<P align=justify>The literary voices of Lyn Lifshin are varied and myriad, and any 
attempt to write a brief review covering the tenor of all the poems in her 
most recent book, would be a too gigantic task to try in this space. <U><I>Before 
It’s Light </I></U>, is more like ten books wrapped in one cover.
<P align=justify>
    No, it’s more like a universe; it runs the gamut of experience and 
imagination, from injured childhood innocence through dangerous knowledge of 
the world. Growing up Jewish in a small New England town, thinking she is 
too ugly and too fat to be loved, a young girl daydreams of escape to life 
in a far-off, glamourous place and time:
<BR><pre>
" . . .This girl, 9,
with too curly hair vows she will never
have children, will travel, live in Paris
or New York . . ."   (p. 80)
</pre>
   <P align=justify> The poems on love and erotica, as forwarned by the title, Beware My Love 
, are explicit, intense experiences, both physically and mentally 
exhausting, and  that seem, at times, more like sexual combat, in an arena 
of joyless lust-- matings in  brief moments, in concert with a sense of 
loss, or perhaps, a sense of not yet having won. The strains of invisible 
melancholy woven throughout are reminiscent of the forlorn songs of Edith 
Piaf,  of fleeting  or lost love.

<P align=justify>   The group of poems about the ambiguous relationship between mother and 
daughter  reveal the symbiotic love and rage that binds them. Yet in the 
end, is the stoic reliving of the agonising vigil over her mother, dying a 
lingering and painful death in the cancer ward. And after the mother’s 
death, the awareness comes that love has triumphed.

<P align=justify>     Lifshin is not all angst and gloom, however.  At times she is 
outrageously funny. The collection that she has titled Red Velvet G-Strings 
And Apricot Sighs , is peopled with characters whom are given character 
parts as Jackie-O, Marilyn, Lorena, The Mad Girl, Jesus. The titles are 
really funny,  yet there are dark undercurrents beneath the cartoonish 
titles, a kind of shuddering empathy.

<P align=justify>     This is seen in the poem, Lorena Remebers The Night She Had A Penis Of 
Her Own -- taken from the horrific tale of a wife, in an act beyond 
everyman’s mutilation nightmare-- slicing off her husband’s penis with a 
kitchen knife, and worse yet, driving into the night and tossing it into a 
roadside ditch.  In the poem, patterned after that incident, the reader gets 
a peek into the mind of the sickened Lorena, contemplating the magnitude of 
what she had done, able to see herself, also, as a severed member:
<BR><pre>
" I could have been
what I held in
my hand that night,
cowering, quivering,
coming apart tho
somehow, even
wounded, abandoned,
I made it too . . ."  (p. 161)
</pre>
    <P align=justify> Lifshin’s poetic imagination traverses time and space. She can project 
herself into the consciousness of someone who lived in distant times and 
places not her own. She weaves a variety of realities; is able to retrieve 
memories of existences as disparate as life in a colonial New England town, 
or enduring the nightmare of captivity in the Nazi death camps.

<P align=justify>   She can recall memories from a vanished Indian nation in the American 
Southwest;  can place herself into the mind of a mummified, five hundred 
year old Tibetan woman in the chilling poem, Tibet Woman (2)  ;
<pre>
" You hear that we’re barbarians, superstitious. Is that all
bad? If you were here, I would take an apple that
goes back, true, as far as before the animals
were named . . ."    (p. 210)
</pre>
<P align=justify>
In the final poem in the book, the poet seems to re-dissolve into the 
daylight of her own time and place:
<pre>
IT GOES ON

like dreaming of
some place after
you leave it.  You
wake up in a daze

rain all day
in the pines.
It goes on
like that green,

like stained glass
between a bedroom
and the hall with
the light always

burning behind it,
cantaloupe and
peach light on
the bed all night"    (p. 239)
</pre>
    <P align=justify> The poet returns from a long and fitful journey into strange and 
distant realms, recovering refreshed, ready to persue other far universes of 
poetic reality.
