	<P>How many decisions do you make daily?</P>

<P>Think about that for a moment.  Isn't everything a decision?  Do I 
get up as soon as the alarm goes off in the morning, or do I hit
the
snooze button?  Do I wear my pants today, or my skirt?  Do we
smile or scowl at the people  around us first thing in the morning?
</P>
<P>Every action and inaction we take every moment of everyday
involves making choices.</P>  

<P>Glen Ridge High School Class of 1980 was noted for being the
largest class in the history of this  suburban community.  The 
majority of us started school together as kindergartners and 
would graduate together thirteen years later.  Very important to 
the average Glen Ridge student was being smart, good looking, and 
be active in a sport.  One of my classmates fit the bill quite
well, 
until his wrestling injury in our Junior Year sidelined him.  The 
wrestling coach took Tom Mapother aside and suggested he 
audition for "Guys and Dolls": the Junior Class Play.  At Glen 
Ridge, there was one play annually and the Junior Class Play was 
it!</P>

<P>Tom could have said, "No, macho athletic guys do not audition for
musicals.  What would the wrestling team think of me dancing 
around a stage?  Nah, not me!" but instead, Tom made the choice
to audition. He took action, got the lead and fell in love with 
performing.</P>

<P>Being in close proximity to Manhattan, opportunities abounded.
He quickly landed a role in a Brooke Shields movie, "Endless Love."
It was a small role, playing one of Brooke's brothers.  I can not 
even remember who played Brooke's love.  Can you?</P>
<P>
The next movie we saw Tom in was "Taps" about kids in a Military 
Academy.  This was mostly a vehicle for Timothy Hutton, recently
successful  in "Ordinary People".  Tom took a small role, but
made the choice to play it with every ounce of his being.  He fully
became a very intense, crazed cadet.  He made the decision to
take a part which could have been insignificant and used it to flex
his acting muscle.  To fully become the role assigned.  He was so 
in the moment, so completely engaging in the part, that it
catapulted him to the attention of many high powered Hollywood 
decision makers.   Tom made a choice and took action by  taking 
a small role and grew it to mammoth, life changing proportions.</P>

<P>After his breakthrough role in "Risky Business", my classmate 
Tom Mapother fully became movie star, Tom Cruise.  His star-making
movie could have become another coming of age teen flick, but
instead it is now a classic.</P>  
<P>
Last weekend I was one of many who sat in the highest grossing
film of the week, "Mission Impossible II".  There was my classmate
getting an adrenaline rush while driving expensive cars and
motorcycles and rock climbing and hobnobbing with the rich and
influential in Sydney,  Australia.  While enjoying the
entertainment
value of this movie, I recognized the power of the star's choices 
from a wrestling injury in his Junior Year in high school up until 
today, more than twenty years later.</P>

<P>As a producer, he was able to decide to film his movie in Sydney,
Australia, his wife's homeland.  He made the choice to do most of 
his own  stuntwork.  He was able to make this heartjumping movie 
on the heels of another movie,  "Magnolia" where he chose to play
a supporting role quite different this one, thus netting an Academy
Award nomination in the process. </P>  

<P>What decisions are you making today?  What will the combined
impact of your choices for today be upon you tomorrow, next 
month and next year?  Regardless of how seemingly insignificant 
the decision may be, think about it.  When you are faced with a
choice today, consider it for an extra second and then take action
on your decision.  Action to bring you closer to realizing your
ideal life.</P>

<P>Theodore Roosevelt said, "In any moment of decision, the best thing
you can do is the right thing. The worst thing you can do is
nothing."
Deciding not to take action is like deciding to keep the door
locked
to your self-induced prison.  If your heart is racing, if you feel
restless, if the depth of feeling startles you deep in your belly
reading these words, the message to you is make powerful choices. 
Take action.</P>
<P>
Live your life as you were meant to live.</P>
