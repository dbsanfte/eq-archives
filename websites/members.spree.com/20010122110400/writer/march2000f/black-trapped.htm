<P align=justify>
I was an invited speaker and panelist on the horror phenomenon at a writer's conference in Bangor, Maine.  While there, I received the prestigious 'Gravestone' for being the state's best selling horror author of the year.  It wasn't until I was returning home that I began to feel apprehensive.
<P align=justify>
I don't know why, but I had the feeling I was being followed.  When I checked my mirror, nothing but my imagination was behind me.   Perhaps it was the deep, shadowy, darkness of the dense woods that I was driving through that provided the reason for my apprehensive feelings.
<P align=justify>
The car was acting up.  It didn't sound right and was losing power.  "Hell, I'm never going to get home," I mumbled to myself.  I better call Ann and tell her I'll be late.  Just then, the car's lights went out, and I pulled over on the dark shoulder to use the cell phone.
<P align=justify>
I looked in the center console, but the phone wasn't there.  Damn!  I knew I'd used it on the way down to the conference to call a conferee.  I looked in the glove compartment, but all I found was the power cord.  That's strange I thought.  What did I do with it?  I was certain I'd put it back in the glove compartment when I finished my call.  "Damn, the car's dead, the phone's missing, and its a cold, miserable night," I grumbled.
<P align=justify>
Great!  It started to sleet.  I got out of the car contemplating the walk back to Andover, the nearest town.  I either had to hoof it back or wait here.  Reluctantly, I locked the car and started walking back in the quiet darkness.
<P align=justify>
The flesh-stinging sleet changed to snow.  I was uneasy.  It wasn't the night, nor the snow.  It was something else in this dark shadowland.  The persistent feeling something was behind me.
<P align=justify>
Since I didn't expect car trouble, I'd ignored my wife's advice to take a hat and gloves.  I remembered telling her, "I won't need them.  I'm not going to be outside.  Besides the hotel has a parking garage, and I'm not going to leave the hotel."  I reflected on that dumb decision and swore to myself from now on I'd prepare for winter even if I expected to be back inside within minutes.
<P align=justify>
It was really cold.  My nose and tips of my ears were burning, my hands were numb to the bone, and my feet were wet because, of course, I didn't take any boots.  I was miserable.  I needed a woolen scarf or something to shield my face.  I knew when I finally reached a filling station, I could have a serious case of frostbite.
<P align=justify>
As I trudged along, I could hear the lonely whining of the wind through the trees.  My feet crunched through the thin crust of ice on the ground, and the road appeared glass smooth.  I wanted to stop and take shelter under one of the big nearby furs until the storm stopped, but that might not be for hours.  I didn't want to be outside that long.
<P align=justify>
I slipped and fell on the uneven shoulder.  I shivered as I looked at my watch.  I'd been walking for an hour, and it was almost nine o'clock.  Ann would start to get worried.  I'd told her I would be home by nine-thirty, and it was clear I'd really be late.  I wished I could call her.
<P align=justify>
Suddenly, I saw headlights of an approaching car, and I began to wave my arms to attract the driver's attention.  He was driving carefully as he approached, and he slowed down just a bit as his headlights came upon me.  Then he sped up.

My injuries had been life threatening.  However, after three weeks with my pinned leg in a brace and only the ache of a broken pelvis bothering me, the doctors were satisfied enough with my progress and discharged me.  I had medication for the discomfort and was told that it would gradually get better.  So depending on my motivation, recovery was pretty much in my hands.
<P align=justify>
"Dear, who's Herbert Sheed?" I said as I looked at the pile of messages Ann took for me during the past four weeks.
<P align=justify>
"I don't know, Dear.  He called and wanted to know how he could get in touch with you.  I gave him your hotel and told him when you would be presenting at the conference.  He thanked me, and said he would get in touch with you there.  I guess he missed you."
<P align=justify>
"I guess so.  Nobody by that name contacted me.  Did he say what he wanted?"
<P align=justify>
"Something about your plots.  He liked the way you put your everyday heroes in seemingly impossible situations but gave them a way out if they were clever enough.  I don't know, something like that.  I really don't remember."
<P align=justify>
"I guess it either wasn't important or he got his questions answered at the conference.  There's one other caller here I don't recognize.  Who is Doctor Carmichael?"
<P align=justify>
Ann came back into the room and looked at the message for a moment and said, "He works at some institute.  I can't remember the name.  He found something that involved you or one of your novels or something like that.  He didn't reach you either?"
<P align=justify>
"No.  I thought he might be someone associated with my accident."
<P align=justify>
"No, he called sometime after your accident.  I don't know.  I've got to get going or I'll never get back."
<P align=justify>
"By the way, are you going to the grocery store?  I've written down some requests."
<P align=justify>
"Sure, give me the list."
<P align=justify>
"Hey, don't forget to bring back a small Christmas tree for the house.  Something about three or four feet tall we can decorate this week.  Just because I'm laid up doesn't mean we have to forgo a tree."
<P align=justify>
"That's a good idea!  There's that little lot not far from the grocery on my way back.  I'll stop there and get one.  What about ornaments and lights?"
<P align=justify>
"I know where they are in the closet.  I'll get them down."
<P align=justify>
"Are you up to getting them down from the shelf?"
<P align=justify>
"Sure! I'll manage.  Go on.  This morning's weather report says we're going to get more snow this afternoon.  Hurry up so you're back before it starts."
<P align=justify>
"Bye Dear.  Back in a couple of hours.  Don't forget to feed Rusty.  I let him out this morning to do his thing and chase some rabbits.  He should be whining to come in soon.  See ya," and with that she was out the door.
<P align=justify>
There was something about the name Herbert Sheed that disturbed me.  The name was familiar, but I hadn't heard it at the conference - somewhere else.  It seemed to me I read it somewhere, maybe a newspaper.  I tottered over to the closet and got out my coat and hat and then went out on the back porch where we gathered the old newspapers for the recycler.  Maybe it was in one of the papers I read before the accident.
<P align=justify>
A half hour later I found the article.  It was a book review of a novel written by Herbert Sheed dated a week before my accident.  The review started by saying, "Robert Small eat your heart out."  The reviewer thought that Sheed was my heir apparent and couldn't wait for his next novel.  I remembered I wanted to see for myself how good Sheed was by ordering his book from Amazon dot com.  The phone interrupted my thoughts.  "Hello?"
<P align=justify>
"Mr. Small?"
<P align=justify>
"Yes, who is this?"
<P align=justify>
"Mr. Small, I'm Doctor Carmichael from the Bangor Institute.  I'm glad I caught you at home.  Do you have a few minutes to talk?"
<P align=justify>
"Yes, of course.  What is it?"
<P align=justify>
"Mr. Small, I don't know if you are familiar with the Bangor Institute, but we treat individuals who have problems coping with life in one way or another."
<P align=justify>
"I'm sorry Doctor, but what has this to do with me?"
<P align=justify>
"Yes, yes I'm getting to that.  You see we found a story we think you should read.  It was written by one of our self committed patients and..."
<P align=justify>
"Doctor, excuse me for interrupting you, but I don't read stories submitted to me.  I suggest you call an agent to represent you."
<P align=justify>
"Mr. Small, I don't need an agent, and I can certainly understand why you don't read stories submitted to you.  But this is different.  This story is about you, and you need to see it."
<P align=justify>
"Doctor, I'm flattered that someone at your institute wrote about me, but I still don't read unsolicited stories.  I'm sorry, but I have to go," and I hung up.
<P align=justify>
I'd turned away from the phone when it rang again.  "Hello."
<P align=justify>
"Mr. Small, the story is about your death."
<P align=justify>
"Come again.  What about my death?"
<P align=justify>
"I read you were recently involved in some kind of accident coming home from a conference.  This story, written four weeks before that conference, describes in detail, how you were walking alongside a dark road and were hit by a car.  Is that how you were injured?"
<P align=justify>
"Yes, it was.  But anyone could have gotten the details from reading the newspaper."
<P align=justify>
"Mr. Small, this story predicted your accident five weeks prior to it.  The story also makes it clear that it wasn't an accident.  I think you should read the rest of the story.  You may be in danger."
<P align=justify>
"In danger, why?"
<P align=justify>
"Mr. Small, what I'm about to tell you must be kept in strictest confidence.  This story is so horrible with its graphic details, and the fact that it predicted your accident with such accuracy, I felt I had no choice but to break a confidence and send it to you for your own protection."
<P align=justify>
"For the past year, we've had a self admitted patient.  The patient fancied himself as a horror story writer somewhat like yourself.  However, this individual wrote his stories and then acted out the plots.  He said he couldn't help himself after he wrote a story.  He had to act it out to see if he had the details right.  He initially scared himself when, in a sane moment, he discovered what he was doing.  That's when he committed himself."
<P align=justify>
"We worked with him, but instead of getting better, he got worse.  At first, the stories were about animal mutilations and death.  Three months ago his stories turned more violent and began to mention fictional people.  We became concerned and tried to get him committed, but we were unsuccessful."
<P align=justify>
"He left us.  In cleaning his room, we found a story of his on the floor behind a dresser.  It was about you.  We put it in his file with the intention of returning it.  However, we found he no longer resided at the address he gave us upon admission, and he left no forwarding address."
<P align=justify>
"When I read of your accident, the details in the article seemed familiar.  So familiar that I felt I'd read them before.  That's when I went to his file and retrieved the story.  Everything was there.  How you, and you are mentioned by name Mr. Small, are on a lonely stretch of road returning to your home at night.  The visibility is bad.  You are standing on the side of the road because of a car problem.  You are hit by a passing car."
<P align=justify>
"Mr. Small, the driver of that car was our patient.  He says it in his story.  It's clear he ran into you on purpose."
<P align=justify>
"Doctor, what was your patient's name?"
<P align=justify>
After a long pause Doctor Carmichael whispered, "Herbert Sheed."
<P align=justify>
A dreadful premonition passed through me like a cold knife.  "Doctor, will you fax the story to me?"
<P align=justify>
"Yes, I thought you might want to see it.  But you cannot say where you got it or mention my name or the Institute's.  Is that agreed?"
<P align=justify>
"It is."
<P align=justify>
"Fine, I'll take you at your word.  Give me your fax number, and I'll transmit it after we hang up.  Oh, Mr. Small, one more thing.  It seems that he thought he might not be successful with the accident attempt, so he describes two other very gruesome alternatives for your demise.  Since you are still alive, I think you should read the alternatives so you can be prepared.  As I said, with his other stories, he worked out the final details by committing the acts and discarding plots that didn't work.  That's why I believe you are in grave danger."
<P align=justify>
"Thank you, Doctor for your warning.  Please send me his story immediately."
<P align=justify>
Ten minutes later I was reading the first pages of the faxed story when the fax stopped.  I picked up the phone to call the doctor and tell him of the interrupted transmission, but the line was dead.
<P align=justify>
The story started with a stalker sabotaging my car.  Obviously Sheed was the stalker and had done something to the car at the conference so it would fail on my way home.  According to his story, he knew where I lived so he didn't have to follow closely.  He knew the route, and he could wait until my car stopped before making his move.  All the details were there except there was no mention of the weather.
<P align=justify>
The last three pages had a different scenario.  The stalker isolated me in my house with my wife.  Scary enough, but what happened next was worse.  It started with his terrorizing us, but the fax was interrupted after that.  Great, I needed to know what he was thinking.
<P align=justify>
Now the writer in me began to take over and hypothesized other ways Sheed might end his story.  What was it Ann said Sheed told her on the phone?  He admired me because I took ordinary people and put them in a bad situation.  If they were clever enough they could survive.  Was Sheed perfecting his plot so I wouldn't?
<P align=justify>
I went out to the back porch, whistled and called for Rusty.  No response.  Damn!  That's just like him to go off chasing rabbits or squirrels and then come home at night all wet and dirty.  While I thought that's probably what happened, I still worried because maybe there was another explanation.  Sheed had him.
<P align=justify>
As I reentered our house, my skin began to crawl as I thought of all the nasty things Sheed might be inclined to do.  I began to fear for our fuzzy faced friend.  Where was he?  Why hadn't he come home?  I told myself my problem was an overactive imagination.  Rusty was chasing squirrels.
<P align=justify>
The front door banged causing me to jump.  As I turned around, Ann burst in with bags of groceries.  "Hi!  How are you doing?  Did you have any trouble getting the Christmas lights?" she said as she came into the kitchen.  Before I could answer, she went out again to the car.
<P align=justify>
She brought in two more large bags of groceries, dropped them on the kitchen counter and said, "I'll get the tree next."  Again she bustled out the door before I had the chance to say anything.
<P align=justify>
I didn't want to tell her about my suspicions.  After all, that's all they were -- just suspicions.  I folded up the fax and stuffed it into my back pocket.  She came back in and put down the Christmas tree and another bag of groceries by the kitchen table.  She took off her coat and mittens, draped the coat over a kitchen chair, and gave me a big wet kiss on the mouth.  "Well?" she said.
<P align=justify>
"Uh, an idea for a story came to me right after you left, and I forgot to get the lights.  I'll get them now while you put the groceries away."
<P align=justify>
"I'll get them."
<P align=justify>
"No, let me do it.  The doctor said I'll recuperate faster if I'm active.  He doesn't want me to sit or lay around, and that's all I've been doing since you left."
<P align=justify>
"Who visited you while I was gone?"
<P align=justify>
"Nobody.  Why?"
<P align=justify>
"There's an extra set of car tracks part way up the drive.  I thought someone came out to visit.  Who was it?"
<P align=justify>
A shiver went through me.  I had a feeling of foreboding, and my blood chilled.  I lied.  "Oh, I forgot about the mailman.  He brought the mail to the door.  Wasn't that nice?"
<P align=justify>
"He did?  That was nice.  What did we get?"
<P align=justify>
"Uh, ads.  I threw them away already.  I'll go get the lights," I said trying to change the conversation.
<P align=justify>
"Okay, but if you can't reach them let me know."
<P align=justify>
"I will, Dear."  I hobbled out of the kitchen, locked the front door, and went up the stairs.  After getting the lights, I looked out the bedroom window at the falling snow that covered the ground and trees below.  Winter in the White Mountains of Maine was picturesque.
