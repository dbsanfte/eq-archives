	<b>
	<P>In every relationship there are times when each partner has very
different
needs, wants, desires or possibly there has been an issue of
infidelity,
etc.  It is at these times when the relationship and the commitment
of the
partners are truly put to a test. </P> 


<P>Someone recently wrote to me telling of how their wife wanted to
quit her
rather high paying job to be a stay at home mom.  Like many
American
families today, they were basically spending what they made each
month.
Therefore, in order for the wife to quit her job, they had to make
significant sacrifices - selling their home and cars to buy much
less
expensive ones, reorganizing dept, doing without the extras such as
going
out to dinner so often, and other such financial considerations.</P>


<P>The husband in this case was somewhat torn.  He understood the
value of
having his wife home with the children, but was frustrated by
having to
make such drastic changes to their finances and way of life.
Ultimately,
he conceded to his wife's wishes, but was having a difficult time
letting
go of the resentment he felt towards her for forcing these changes
upon him
and the family. </P>


<P>It's important in these times to remember that marriage is a
partnership.
When an issue arises, it should be thoroughly discussed and the
options
carefully weighed.  Working together to find a solution is crucial.
However, once a decision or plan of action is arrived at, the work
is not
done.  Often times, this is the deciding point as to whether or not
the
ultimate outcome will be a success. </P>


<P>Whenever there has been a compromise on any issue in a
relationship, there
are always going to be feelings of resentment, jealousy, hostility,
etc. -
at least to some degree.  To deny this is to deny our being human.
The key
is for both partners to recognize this fact and to deal with it.
It's
extremely important for the partner who conceded to understand that
by
doing so, he or she gives up the right to what I like to refer to
as the
ever-popular and cynical "Yeah, but." </P>

<P>
"... yeah, but if you hadn't quit your job we could afford a
vacation this
year."   "... yeah, I'm glad you are happier staying at home with
the kids,
but I sure miss the boat we used to own."</P>  

<P>
We're all guilty of doing this, and I'm sure as you're reading
this, you're
recalling your own tirade of infamous "Yeah, buts." </P> 


<P>When we work together in resolving issues in the best interest of
the
relationship, there is no room for the "yeah, but."  Understanding
and
accepting the consequences of our decisions is mandatory, and
means we
don't get the option of complaining about it later or bringing it
up each
time a new problem or issue presents itself.  In basic terms, this
means NO
WHINING ALLOWED.</P>


<P>Presumably each compromise in a relationship is made out of the
desire to
ultimately make the relationship better and stronger.  This simply
can't
happen if we are unable to take responsibility for our decisions
and accept
the consequences thereof.   Therefore, hard as it may be, we all
need to
say goodbye to our old friend the "yeah, but."</P>
