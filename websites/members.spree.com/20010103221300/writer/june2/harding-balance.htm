	<P>	"When I catch up with her, she'll wish she'd stayed home last night!"  She spit these words out at the hedge, slamming the front door with a heavy thump on the last word.  The hedge remained motionless, indifferent to her tirade, and watched as she tromped down the steps then uphill toward the subway, some four blocks away.  Its trimmed leaves would not bask in sunlight for another hour, but having nowhere to go (and no desire to get there), it waited with practiced patience, noting how similar the young one had departed just after the last sundown.  That front door has earned its keep these past few days! the hedge thought . . . Hmph!  Just what it deserves for being in the way . . .</P>
	<P>Stasia Howland took to the two-block hill with a defiant lean, almost power walking and looking comical doing so in her long trench coat and backpack.  The sidewalk was already half full with others headed for the subway, but she moved through the irregular crowd as if she were zipping them up behind her, paying no attention to those she passed as her mind raced beyond the quickest pace, remembering the fight that had caused Danielle to storm out against a hail of shouted words.</P>
	<P><I>They faced each other, fists on hips and eyes glaring, mirroring each other and hurling words spoken by most daughters and mothers at one time or another.</I></P>
	<I><P>"You never let me go anywhere!"</P></I>
	<P><I>	"That's not true!  Just last week . . ."</I></P>
	<I><P>"That's cause you felt bad when dad didn't show up for his so-called visitation, and it was only to see a movie with Erica!"  Danielle loathed the thirteen year old girl who lived above them.  "She's so stupid!  She doesn't even care that I hate her guts!"</P></I>
	<P><I>"Watch your mouth, young lady!" Stasia hissed, "You know they can hear us upstairs when . . ."</I></P>
	<I><P>"When we what, mama?" Louder now.  "When we fight?  When we argue?  When we do the same damned thing day after day?!"</P></I>
	<P><I>"You will NOT use that language in this house, Danielle Howland!  Take your coat off and get to your room like I told you to!"</I></P>
	<I><P>"No!"</P></I>
	<P><I>Stasia took a half-step toward Danielle, raising her hand in the process.  "Never tell your own mother -"</I></P>
	<I><P>"NO!  NO!  NO!  NO!"  Danielle shrieked a full octave higher, leaning toward the inevitable slap which came with unusual force, rocking her head back and spinning her toward the door, now a mass of hair and tears through which feeble echoes of her one word rebellion still dribbled out.</P></I>
	<P><I>"GO TO YOUR ROOM!" Stasia roared, at this point not giving a damn if the bakery down the street heard her.  Her own hair had become disheveled, giving her the appearance of a panting lunatic.  She turned sideways like a gate and pointed down the hall toward the back.</I></P>
	<I><P>An eternal minute elapsed as each of them caught their breath and the air crackled with tension.  Then Danielle started toward the door.</P></I>
	<P><I>"Don't you dare - " Stasia started</I></P>
	<I><P>"Fuck you, mama."  Danielle interjected calmly as she opened the door and slipped into the infant night with a whisper of fabric and the door's slam like a nail in Stasia's coffin.</P></I>
	<P><I>	" - COME BACK IF YOU LEAVE!"  Then silence followed, infinitely more painful than her stinging palm, shattering her heart into a thousand weeping sobs.  After frantically calling all of Danielle's friends with no success, she finally dropped into a fitful sleep clutching a pillow against her like a lost child, and dreamed of crying babies all through the night.</I></P>
	<P>Stasia's head was bowed as she crested the hill, lost in the memory of waking without Danielle's sleep-sounds in the next room, and did not notice the drug deal going bad across the street.  An epithet followed by brief scuffling, then a flurry of shots, sounding like fireworks to later witnesses.  "I wish she knew how I felt," Stasia mumbled under her last breath, just as a stray bullet ripped through her neck before lodging itself square in the center of the eight of 1811 Kismet Drive's numbered mailbox.</P>
	<P>At that moment, some eleven blocks across town, Danielle lay on her side in Eddie's bed, staring out the window at a red brick wall just a few feet away and replaying in her mind the moment of liberation, as if wanting to sear it into her memory forever.</P>
	<P><I>" - COME BACK IF YOU LEAVE!"  Her mom's final bellow followed Danielle like a muffled foghorn in the rising mist as the girl snuffled her way toward Eddie's house, knowing he would let her stay there for the night.  "If mama knew I'll be staying at Eddie's tonight, the witch would have a fricken' heart attack!"  This caused Danielle to smile despite the swelling bruise across her face.</I></P>
	<I><P>The walk to Eddie's was filled with shadows and echoes of arguments and screams, quickening her pace until she arrived breathless at his basement entrance.  Soon she lay curled up next to Eddie in front of the furnace, spilling her torments out like a broken dam while he sympathetically stroked her hair, then neck, then covered her face with kisses, tasting her briny sorrow until she gave herself up to him for the first time.  His hands, his mouth, his hardness helped push the shadows away until sleep captured them both through sheer exhaustion.</P></I>
	<P>He slept next to her, breathing in a raspy way that somehow reminded her of a revolving door.  She jabbed an annoyed elbow in his ribs, and when he mumbled from his sleep, "wha - " and lumbered closer to his side, she hissed, "That's what you get for being in the way."  Then a lump of sadness filled her throat like rising blood as she choked tearfully to herself, "I wish she knew how I felt," not knowing that at that very moment, within her womb, both their wishes were coming true.</P>
