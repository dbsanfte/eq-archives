		<P>When I was a young man growing up, retirement meant one thing
and one thing only - you had reached the age of 65.  Today it is
more confusing.  It is much more a matter of personal
attitude as to whether one is retired or not.  Of course we are
still concerned with the artificial break that rings in our 65th
birthday but many more are 'retiring' earlier, sometimes as early
as 45 years of age.</P>


<P>As far as the law is concerned, retirement age has stayed
much the same for the last 85 years when government first fixed
it at 65 for everybody. There was no change in this law until the
mid 1940's when government conceded an earlier retirement age
for women at 60. In the early years of the 21st Century we are
about to reverse this decision and equalise once again men and
women's 'official' retirement age to 65 years once again.</P>


<P>What does that really mean?  Coming full circle it could mean
that we have learned nothing over the years.  It has long since
been accepted practice that 'retirement'  does not have the same
meaning as it once did.  We now have 'partial' retirement,
'early' retirement and 'career' retirement. I even have a friend
who's ambition is to retire until he is 65 and then he will start
work; nice idea!  Retirement, though still perceived as a
'target' at 60/65, does not now automatically mean that we must 
cease to work from that day on.</P>


<P>We are living longer and we are staying fitter longer and many of
Us, at 65, have another ten or more years work left in us yet. 
The establishment however, has still not changed its view, 
employers, by and large, still require us to 'cease our employment' 
when we reach that 'magic' age of 65. It is as if two days before 
we 'retire' we are able beings and two days after we are unable.  
What a nonsense this all is.</P>


<P>Hopefully in this new millennium a new 'more favourable' trend
will emerge. A suggestion put to government by Professor Alan 
Walker of Sheffield University in England nearly ten years ago 
is at last being seriously considered. The suggestion, which 
makes practical sense, is that we should effectively take a 
decade in which to retire.  The proposition has been made that 
a 'decade' of retirement be considered from the age of 60 to 70, 
as a period of 'gradual' retirement.</P>


<P>The rough idea is that at the age of 60 or so, dependent upon the
employee and employer's mutual agreement, a person would start 
a winding down programme that will come to fruition at a mutually 
agreed time up to their 70th birthday. This benefits the individual, 
in reducing the 'shock' effect of  an instant cut-off date from a 
lifetime of employment. The employer also benefits by his 
gradually being able to replace the retiree seamlessly, with 
another, fully trained and up to speed employee.</P>


<P>Under this arrangement an employee could gradually reduce his or
her working hours to suit personal circumstances over a longer
more controlled period of time.  It will also give the option, if
agreeable, of 'instant' retirement, at any time during this
period. More essentially it gives everybody freedom of choice.</P>

<P>
It must be immediately pointed out that this arrangement in
itself could not affect any 'pension' arrangements between the
employee and employer.  This is an entirely different 'Insurance'
based matter and poses entirely different questions.</P>

<P>
Probably one of the most disturbing trends in the past thirty
years has been the growth of  the 'early retirement schemes'.  We
are used to enforced retirement at 65, but 45, never! 'Early
retirement schemes' are supposed to be 'voluntary' but in many
cases age discriminatory pressure is put on employees to 'make
way'.  This social trend has become accepted in the West though
it does great socio-economic harm.</P>


<P>As a direct result of this phenomena, in the UK alone there are
two million fewer men, over 45, in the workforce than there were
thirty years ago.  It is currently accepted that there are 3 million
long-term unemployed or economically inactive people, over the age 
of 45 in the UK today, a huge problem for government who estimate 
the direct social security bill at £26 billion ($40 billion) every year.
</P>

<P>Most of these people were excluded from the workforce because 
of Employer prejudice and all of them are subject to age
discrimination in trying to get back into work. Many of them 
simply give up and consider themselves to be retired.  Many more 
claim sickness benefits or struggle along in part time work or even 
in the 'black economy' considering themselves as 'unemployable'.
The Government, by institutional habit has condoned this by
considering them officially to be retired early, at the age of 55
at which age they disappear from the official unemployment
statistics.</P>


<P>The key factor to the practice of early retirement is certainly
anything but voluntary.  Age discrimination has become 
entrenched in our society.  So much so that even individual 
politicians are determined to root it out.  There have been a 
number of attempts over the years, attempting to stop age 
discrimination. Inevitably they have been stifled by vested 
interest in government. At the end of the day employers
and older workers are being urged to learn, unsatisfactorily, to
change their own attitudes.</P>

<P>
It is never good practice to accept retirement as a foregone
conclusion.  If we are to profit by it and enjoy it then we must
be able to plan for it.  As we live longer and stay fitter, many
of us can expect to live usefully into our 'eighties'. 10 to 15
years of partial and full retirement might be satisfactory.
However the concept of early retirement, from the age of 45
onwards, is exceptionally unrealistic,  The question 'who pays?'
comes to mind. There is a danger that unless we stop the 
discrimination rot now, many of our valued senior citizens 
would be forced to spend more time in retirement than they 
would have ever worked.</P>


<P>Whether you are the retiring type or not you still have
responsibilities.  A half of the 'electorate' in the West is now
over 45 and as a body of people we have huge responsibilities 
and 'power'. We can waste that power by the uncontrolled use 
of apathy and unreasonable disinterest or we might consider 
joining together to help make our society as great and as proud 
as it used to be, once more.  In the end it is up to us all 
individually.  I know for sure that I'm not the retiring type.  Not 
for now anyway!</P>
