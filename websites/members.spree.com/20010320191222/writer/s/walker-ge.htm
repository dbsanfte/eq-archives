	<P>
	Across the Western World, over the next eighteen months we will
experience very important series of national elections to
government.</P>

<P>
A number of significant factors will make these elections
different to others.  The first factor is the demographics of the
electorate themselves. The second is the global village factor in
that what happens in America has an effect on Europe; what
happens in the UK has a distinct effect on Africa.  Third factor
must be the Internet.  People are so well informed today and can
always become more so. That it is possible for Joe Bloggs to
discover world news almost before his head of government can,
empowers him to be highly accurate in his choices.</P>

<P>
It is not really possible for governments to pull the wool over
one's eyes anymore.  Everyone now knows the issues; if you like
the only issue now is interpretation.</P>


<P>What is already happening is that polarisation is bringing the
various opposition parties of the western world closer together
and 'issue' politics is becoming the only difference.  The
'issue' this year might be health, next year food, the year after
the dollar, the pound, the yen and God help it, the Euro.</P>

<P>
It is difficult to find constants anymore and it is likely that
the next batch of elections will root them out.  One of the few
constants that is growing and is likely to continue to grow over
the next twenty years is our demographics of living.</P>


<P>By 2002 a half of the electorate in the west will be over the age
of 45.  Seniors, Thirdagers, Golden Oldies or silly old sods,
whatever we are labelled as, we will have much more power, grey
power if you like, as to how our governments will behave.</P>


<P>It is almost like an era in waiting and what is more, the current
standing governments are waking up to it.  It's 'let's look after
the oldies time'. For the first time ever 'they' are taking older
people issues much more seriously than ever before.  The
opposition parties are fighting with one another to capitalise on
the 'Grey Vote'.  However the older generation are not as easily
bought as they used to be.</P>


<P>We are staying 'young' longer; we are fitter, wealthier and much
more opportunistic than our forebears.  Dare it be said that at
65 many of us are more ambitious than we have ever been in our
lives.</P>

<P>
Far more over 45's than under have taken up the opportunities
thrown up by the Internet.  We are empowered.  Older people, in
their wisdom, understand the values that the World Wide Web gives
them.  They realise too that it is becoming a smaller world every
day.  We holiday in every single part of the world. Our families
no longer live in the same village; this is a global village and
half the family lives half a world away. Add to this the modern
miracles of communication.  From the UK I can send an email to
Japan and get a reply in an hour.  The older generation is the
only generation, because of a lifetime's experience, to
understand the full value of these benefits and we will demand
that our future governments recognise this.  They are beginning
to get the message. We must make sure that the clarion call is
deafening in their ears.</P>


<P>

The next election starts here !</P>
