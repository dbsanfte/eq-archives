	Psychology as Storytelling

	<P>Storytelling has been with us since the days of campfire and besieging wild
animals. It served a number of important functions: amelioration of fears,
communication of vital information (regarding survival tactics and the
characteristics of animals, for instance), the satisfaction of a sense of
order (justice), the development of the ability to hypothesize, predict and
introduce theories and so on.
</P>
<P>We are all endowed with a sense of wonder. The world around us in
inexplicable, baffling in its diversity and myriad forms. We experience an
urge to organize it, to "explain the wonder away", to order it in order to
know what to expect next (predict). These are the essentials of survival.
But while we have been successful at imposing our mind's structures on the
outside world - we have been much less successful when we tried to cope with
our internal universe.</P>

<P>The relationship between the structure and functioning of our (ephemeral)
mind, the structure and modes of operation of our (physical) brain and the
structure and conduct of the outside world have been the matter of heated
debate for millennia. Broadly speaking, there were (and still are) two ways
of treating it:</P>

<P>There were those who, for all practical purposes, identified the origin
(brain) with its product (mind). Some of them postulated the existence of a
lattice of preconceived, born categorical knowledge about the universe - the
vessels into which we pour our experience and which mold it. Others have
regarded the mind as a black box. While it was possible in principle to know
its input and output, it was impossible, again in principle, to understand
its internal functioning and management of information. Pavlov coined the
word "conditioning", Watson adopted it and invented "behaviorism", Skinner
came up with "reinforcement". But all ignored the psychophysical question:
what IS the mind and HOW is it linked to the brain?</P>

<P>The other camp was more "scientific" and "positivist". It speculated that
the mind (whether a physical entity, an epiphenomenon, a non-physical
principle of organization, or the result of introspection) - had a structure
and a limited set of functions. They argued that a "user's manual" could be
composed, replete with engineering and maintenance instructions. The most
prominent of these "psychodynamists" was, of course, Freud. Though his
disciples (Adler, Horney, the object-relations lot) diverged wildly from his
initial theories - they all shared his belief in the need to "scientify" and
objectify psychology. Freud - a medical doctor by profession (Neurologist)
and Bleuler before him - came with a theory regarding the structure of the
mind and its mechanics: (suppressed) energies and (reactive) forces. Flow
charts were provided together with a method of analysis, a mathematical
physics of the mind.</P>

<P>But this was a mirage. An essential part was missing: the ability to test
the hypotheses, which derived from these "theories". They were all very
convincing, though, and, surprisingly, had great explanatory power. But -
non-verifiable and non-falsifiable as they were - they could not be deemed
to possess the redeeming features of a scientific theory.</P>

<P>Psychological theories of the mind are metaphors of the mind. They are
fables and myths, narratives, stories, hypotheses, conjunctures. They play
(exceedingly) important roles in the psychotherapeutic setting - but not in
the laboratory. Their form is artistic, not rigorous, not testable, less
structured than theories in the natural sciences. The language used is
polyvalent, rich, effusive, and fuzzy - in short, metaphorical. They are
suffused with value judgements, preferences, fears, post facto and ad hoc
constructions. None of this has methodological, systematic, analytic and
predictive merits.</P>

<P>Still, the theories in psychology are powerful instruments, admirable
constructs of the mind. As such, they are bound to satisfy some needs. Their
very existence proves it.</P>

<P>The attainment of peace of mind is a need, which was neglected by Maslow in
his famous rendition. People will sacrifice material wealth and welfare,
will forgo temptations, will ignore opportunities, and will put their lives
in danger - just to reach this bliss of wholeness and completeness. There
is, in other words, a preference of inner equilibrium over homeostasis. It
is the fulfillment of this overriding need that psychological theories set
out to cater to. In this, they are no different than other collective
narratives (myths, for instance).</P>

In some respects, though, there are striking differences:<BR>

<P>Psychology is desperately trying to link up to reality and to scientific
discipline by employing observation and measurement and by organizing the
results and presenting them using the language of mathematics. This does not
atone for its primordial sin: that its subject matter is ethereal and
inaccessible. Still, it lends an air of credibility and rigorousness to it.
</P>
<P>The second difference is that while historical narratives are "blanket"
narratives - psychology is "tailored", "customized". A unique narrative is
invented for every listener (patient, client) and he is incorporated in it
as the main hero (or anti-hero). This flexible "production line" seems to be
the result of an age of increasing individualism. True, the "language units"
(large chunks of denotates and connotates) are one and the same for every
"user". In psychoanalysis, the therapist is likely to always employ the
tripartite structure (Id, Ego, Superego). But these are language elements
and need not be confused with the plots. Each client, each person, and his
own, unique, irreplicable, plot.</P>

To qualify as a "psychological" plot, it must be:<BR>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">a. All-inclusive (anamnetic)</FONT> - It must encompass, integrate and incorporate
all the facts known about the protagonist.</P>
<P>
b. <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">Coherent -</FONT> It must be chronological, structured and causal.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">c. Consistent - Self-consistent</FONT> (its subplots cannot contradict one another
or go against the grain of the main plot) and consistent with the observed
phenomena (both those related to the protagonist and those pertaining to the
rest of the universe).</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">d. Logically compatible</FONT> - It must not violate the laws of logic both
internally (the plot must abide by some internally imposed logic) and
externally (the Aristotelian logic which is applicable to the observable
world).</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">e. Insightful (diagnostic)</FONT> - It must inspire in the client a sense of awe
and astonishment which is the result of seeing something familiar in a new
light or the result of seeing a pattern emerging out of a big body of data.
The insights must be the logical conclusion of the logic, the language and
of the development of the plot.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">f. Aesthetic</FONT> - The plot must be both plausible and "right", beautiful, not
cumbersome, not awkward, not discontinuous, smooth and so on.</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">g. Parsimonious -</FONT> The plot must employ the minimum numbers of assumptions
and entities in order to satisfy all the above conditions.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">h. Explanatory - </FONT>The plot must explain the behaviour of other characters in
the plot, the hero's decisions and behaviour, why events developed the way
that they did.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">i. Predictive (prognostic) -</FONT> The plot must possess the ability to predict
future events, the future behaviour of the hero and of other meaningful
figures and the inner emotional and cognitive dynamics.
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">j. Therapeutic -</FONT> With the power to induce change (whether it is for the
better, is a matter of contemporary value judgements and fashions).
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">k. Imposing - </FONT>The plot must be regarded by the client as the preferable
organizing principle of his life's events and the torch to guide him in the
darkness to come.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">l. Elastic -</FONT> The plot must possess the intrinsic abilities to self organize,
reorganize, give room to emerging order, accommodate new data comfortably,
avoid rigidity in its modes of reaction to attacks from within and from
without.</P>

<P>In all these respects, a psychological plot is a theory in disguise.
Scientific theories should satisfy most of the same conditions. But the
equation is flawed. The important elements of testability, verifiability,
refutability, falsifiability, and repeatability - are all missing. No
experiment could be designed to test the statements within the plot, to
establish their truth-value and, thus, to convert them to theorems.
</P>
<P>There are three reasons to account for this shortcoming:<BR>

<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">a. Ethical -</FONT> Experiments would have to be conducted, involving the hero and
other humans. To achieve the necessary result, the subjects will have to be
ignorant of the reasons for the experiments and their aims. Sometimes even
the very performance of an experiment will have to remain a secret (double
blind experiments). Some experiments may involve unpleasant experiences.
This is ethically unacceptable.</P>

<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1"><P>b. The Psychological Uncertainty Principle - </FONT>The current position of a human
subject can be fully known. But both treatment and experimentation influence
the subject and void this knowledge. The very processes of measurement and
observation influence the subject and change him.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">c. Uniqueness -</FONT> Psychological experiments are, therefore, bound to be
unique, unrepeatable, cannot be replicated elsewhere and at other times even
if they deal with the SAME subjects. The subjects are never the same due to
the psychological uncertainty principle. Repeating the experiments with
other subjects adversely affects the scientific value of the results.
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">d. The undergeneration of testable hypotheses -</FONT> Psychology does not generate
a sufficient number of hypotheses, which can be subjected to scientific
testing. This has to do with the fabulous (=storytelling) nature of
psychology. In a way, psychology has affinity with some private languages.
It is a form of art and, as such, is self-sufficient. If structural,
internal constraints and requirements are met - a statement is deemed true
even if it does not satisfy external scientific requirements.</P>
<P>
So, what are plots good for? They are the instruments used in the
procedures, which induce peace of mind (even happiness) in the client. This
is done with the help of a few embedded mechanisms:</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">a. The Organizing Principle -</FONT> Psychological plots offer the client an
organizing principle, a sense of order and ensuing justice, of an inexorable
drive toward well defined (though, perhaps, hidden) goals, the ubiquity of
meaning, being part of a whole. It strives to answer the "why's" and "how'
s". It is dialogic. The client asks: "why am I (here follows a syndrome)".
Then, the plot is spun: "you are like this not because the world is
whimsically cruel but because your parents mistreated you when you were very
young, or because a person important to you died, or was taken away from you
when you were still impressionable, or because you were sexually abused and
so on". The client is calmed by the very fact that there is an explanation
to that which until now monstrously taunted and haunted him, that he is not
the plaything of vicious Gods, that there is who to blame (focussing
diffused anger is a very important result) and, that, therefore, his belief
in order, justice and their administration by some supreme, transcendental
principle is restored. This sense of "law and order" is further enhanced
when the plot yields predictions which come true (either because they are
self-fulfilling or because some real "law" has been discovered).</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">b. The Integrative Principle -</FONT> The client is offered, through the plot,
access to the innermost, hitherto inaccessible, recesses of his mind. He
feels that he is being reintegrated, that "things fall into place". In
psychodynamic terms, the energy is released to do productive and positive
work, rather than to induce distorted and destructive forces.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">c. The Purgatory Principle - </FONT>In most cases, the client feels sinful,
debased, inhuman, decrepit, corrupting, guilty, punishable, hateful,
alienated, strange, mocked and so on. The plot offers him absolution. Like
the highly symbolic figure of the Saviour before him - the client's
sufferings expurgate, cleanse, absolve, and atone for his sins and
handicaps. A feeling of hard won achievement accompanies a successful plot.
The client sheds layers of functional, adaptive clothing. This is
inordinately painful. The client feels dangerously naked, precariously
exposed. He then assimilates the plot offered to him, thus enjoying the
benefits emanating from the previous two principles and only then does he
develop new mechanisms of coping. Therapy is a mental crucifixion and
resurrection and atonement for the sins. It is highly religious with the
plot in the role of the scriptures from which solace and consolation can be
always gleaned.</P>
