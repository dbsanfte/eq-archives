    <H1><B> Common Pitfalls In Writing  Fiction</B></H1>

<br><br>
<font size=4>
<img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif">We must remember that fiction is fiction. It is not autobiography, nor non-fiction. Too
many times beginners will write fiction which is a poorly disguised autobiography. The
fiction they are attempting to write is bogged down by the restrictions of real life. The
author never really starts the story because she takes too much time and space in
trying to accurately describe and detail every point, whether relevant to the story line
or not.<br><br>

<img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif"> A great story demands more than the truth. Our real lives take place over a long
period of time, there is no sense of urgency in the day to day living we are trying to
elaborate upon in our fiction. Real life has far too many paths, twists and turns that will
detour the beginning writer far afield from her story.<br><br>

<img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif"> Sometimes we must reinvent truth, altering it intensely in order to create fiction. If
your narrator sounds and looks like you, if she has all the same tastes and makes all
the same choices as the author - then the work if heading for a big pitfall - a never
ending black hole of oblivion. The author should never be the narrator. The narrator
should be a character.<br><br>

<img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif"> One way to avoid this trap is to make your narrator as much unlike yourself as you
can. If you have short blonde hair, give them long brown hair. If you drive a jeep have
them drive a BMW. This will allow you to separate yourself from the narrator - freeing
you to be more open-minded and liberal in your story telling, allowing you to sway
from the boring and time consuming minute details of real life. In fiction it is said that
we must not be faithful - but we must cheat on the truth. That is how great stories are
written.

<font size=5>COMMON PITFALL # 2<br><br>
<font size=4>


<img src="/writer/gif/eaglebld.gif"> Most of my students, and some of my clients have the wild idea that the ending of
their stories must hold a huge surprise, or interesting twist, an unexpected and
implausible ending. These work in some genres of course, such as mystery or
thrillers. But in today’s fiction, contemporary fiction, the “trick” ending is a signpost
which alerts the reader that the author is a beginner. I.E. The protagonist jumps from a
16 story 
building , the pool man turns out to be the employer's father from another lifetime, the
narrator is an alien. These types of last minute surprise endings, which fail miserably,
cross my desk more often than not.<br><br>

<img src="/writer/gif/eaglebld.gif"> So what then must be done to provide a sound ending, an ending with integrity? The
determination must come from within the character or from an outside element within
the body of the story. If a character changes her mind, she must do so as a result of her
own experiences and actions. She should not be rescued at the last second by a new
character, or be made to realize a monumental fact as a result of a last minute
occurrence. These surprise endings are lazy work for the author, and most times they
are also fruitless. The endings must be believable and interesting. It is far more
interesting and intriguing to have a story draw to conclusion based upon the
character’s own motivation, their own behaviors and thoughts. These stories may be
much more difficult to write, but they are also much more satisfying to the editor,
reader, and author alike.
