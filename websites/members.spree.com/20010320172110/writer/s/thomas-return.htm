<P>Relationship fights are supposed to clear the air and bring us closer
together. That's what relationship experts have told us. Too often, though,
the opposite occurs. A fight creates distance . . . and makes both partners
feel as though love has been destroyed. Is there a way to return a
relationship to love after a fight? There is . . . and I found it when
fights created distance in my marriage, a marriage that had before only
experienced love.</P>

<P>It happened during the most stressful years of my marriage, right after our
son Jeffrey died in an auto accident. Bob and I were both very angry,
consumed with grief. When we fought during those years, we almost always
said things we regretted. For example, Bob has a habit of drinking too much
coffee and getting grouchy as a result. In the days following our son's
death, I had no tolerance for unhappiness. The weight of grief and guilt I
carried was just too much for me to handle, and Bob's frequent barking
touched my unhappiness nerve.</P>

<P>"Coffee turns you into a grouch and makes me sorry I married you." I wasn't
trying to put him down. I merely wanted him to realize how much his
grouchiness was hurting me, but Bob felt put down and he retaliated. "You're
a health nut! No one can live up to your standards!" Once, he became so
angry he stormed out and told me he would divorce me if I ever put him down
again.</P>

<P>"How can I return my relationship to love?" It's a question I desperately
needed an answer to when I thought I might lose the man I loved. Yes, Bob
lets coffee sharpen his tongue - and he has other annoying habits as well -
but he's a great guy. I can't imagine living without him. You feel the same
way about your partner. When left alone in an empty room, we all want our
partners back.</P>

<P>"How can I return my relationship to love?" To find the answer, I first
flipped through my large collection of self-help relationship books. I
didn't find anything that would help me, however. Even the most popular ones
outlined communication techniques that seemed outdated. I wanted something
spiritual, something that would return Bob and I to the good relationship we
already had - not change it into something awkward or mechanical.</P>

<P>I decided to try something unusual. I looked into the spiritual
team-building techniques Bob and I had developed to create success in our
business. Our techniques had increased morale, sales and collections, and
Bob and I had solved other business problems with them as well. Would one of
our team-building exercises return our marriage to love? I had nothing to
lose and so I gave it a try.</P>

<P>While Bob was driving around the block trying to cool off, I used one of my
most successful business exercises, called "What you appreciate . . .
grows," and I adapted it to relationships.</P>
<P>
I took out a blank piece of paper. At the top of the page, I wrote: "Things
I like about Bob." I listed some of the qualities that had attracted me to
him: He's loyal, he talks to me about his feelings, he's supportive of my
goals in life, he's good-looking.</P>

<P>Next, I wrote down this question: "Why do I like these things about Bob?"
</P>
<P>Under "He's loyal," I wrote:</P>

<P>I know that he'll never cheat on me<BR>
He takes my side when someone picks on me<BR>
No one ever puts me down when he's around<BR>
He's the type of person who will work out problems</P>
<P>
Under "He talks to me about his feelings," I wrote:</P>

<P>I feel good when Bob shares his feelings with me<BR>
I feel more confident about myself, less awkward about my own feelings<BR>
I feel relieved - as though I'm being given permission to share too
</P>
<P>Under "He's supportive of my goals," I wrote:</P>

<P>He's always there when I need him!<BR>
He's my champion<BR>
Whenever I pick on myself, he tells me that I'm being too hard on myself<BR>
I know that - no matter what - Bob will love me<BR>
How many women can say this?<BR>
I never thought I'd have someone who loves me this much</P>

<P>Under "He's good-looking," I wrote:</P>

<P>I'm a little embarrassed to admit how much I like watching Bob undress, but
<BR>I do<BR>
He's all man<BR>
He didn't get flabby when he reached his 50's<BR>
I would have loved him anyway, but it's a treat to see him keep his good
looks<BR>
Some days, he reminds me of the boy he once was<BR>
He's strong and handsome - and I dream about going to the prom with him<BR>
I didn't have many joyful days as a teenage<BR>
With Bob it would have been so different<BR>
He's graceful - probably because he plays golf<BR>
I wonder if playing golf has made him a good dancer?</P>

<P>I wrote the exercise from my heart. I didn't write the things that self-help
books and religious leaders tell us we're supposed to appreciate. I wrote
down the things about Bob that make me happy. Then, with the second
question, "Why do I like these things?" . . . I amplified my thoughts.
</P>
<P>It worked! When Bob returned home - instead of giving me the silent
treatment - he apologized. He had never apologized to me after a fight. He
had always delegated the job of fixing our fights to me. He's not the type
of man who likes to give in.</P>
<P>
But that night, he did give in. He gave in to love. I had not only found the
key to returning our relationship to love . . . I had found a magical new
way to communicate with Bob, using a spiritual technique to accurately
express the feelings in my heart and bypass the words that are often
misunderstood.</P>

<P>You can do the same thing! Use this new spiritual tool after a fight, or
when you feel unappreciated or rejected, or when you just want more love.
Use it with all of your relationships, even your business relationships. For
whenever love is missing . . . you'll now be able to return your
relationships to love.</P>

<P> Mary Anne Thomas's "Creative Relationships" discoveries
have been taught in popular and professional seminars all around the world,
and her "Creative Relationships" course was the first information on
relationships taught to family practice physicians through the University of
North Carolina Medical School. Mary Anne is the author of "An Adventure of
the Mind," a new spiritual workbook that teaches you how to manifest your
dreams using mental and spiritual tools rather than physical effort. It's
the true story of her own adventure with her husband following the death of
their son, as they decided to find more powerful, more spiritual ways to
live. Find "An Adventure of the Mind" as well as free articles that teach
the wonders of creating with the mind at http://www.mindadventures.com</P>
