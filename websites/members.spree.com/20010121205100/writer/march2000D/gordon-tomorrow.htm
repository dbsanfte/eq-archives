<B><U><CENTER>Chapter 1  My Very Own Ready To Wear Off The Peg Adventure</CENTER></B></U>
<BR><P align=justify>
The Sinai Peninsula has been the gateway between Africa and Asia since time immemorial. It is coldly described on the map as 24,000 square feet of desert wilderness, an arid moonscape of jagged ranges.  But it's much more than that. The Sinai has been touched in one way or other by most of Western and Near Eastern history, both actual and mythic. It is, as I discovered, a dramatic, beautiful and mystical place; and this is my account of a five day sponsored hike across the southern Sinai desert to raise money for Scope, a charity that helps people with Cerebral Palsy. 
<P align=justify>It all started on a wet, dreary, Sunday in October, with an advertisement  that my wife, Wendy, spotted hidden in the back of the travel section of a Sunday paper. There was a number you could ring for more details, and at Wendy's suggestion, I rang the 0800 number,  got a recorded message and spluttered out the information I though they wanted, and that was the end of it; or so I thought - but, the seed had been planted.
<P align=justify>A few days latter a large, anonymous, brown envelope arrived. I opened it, and there it was, my very own ready-to-wear-off-the-peg-adventure. Here was my chance to go back to the Sinai. You see twenty years ago I had spent seven months working on a Kibbutz in Israel, and during that time I made three unforgettable trips to the Sinai. Those seven months were a defining point in my life. The first steps on the journey that had brought me here, and I desperately needed to restart that journey. The last eighteen months had not been good. For the first time, I had felt that I was loosing my battle with Parkinson's disease. What had started six years ago as a minor irritation, had become a major problem. It was starting to get the upper hand, to dominate every aspect of my life.  I desperately needed a challenge, something to aim for. I needed to go full circle and restart the journey that I had begun just over 20 years ago - yes, this seed had landed on fertile ground.
<P align=justify>There was just one catch, to qualify for the walk, I had to raise £2000 by the end of January. But, what had at first seemed such a daunting prospect, was in the end a lot of fun. Wendy got the fund raising off to a flying start with a charity lunch that raised over £200. I wrote a newsletter to send out with the Christmas cards. Our friends and family came up trumps, and by Christmas we had reached the thousand pound mark.  The difficult bit was going to be raising the next thousand. 
<P align=justify>The turning point, in more ways than one, was getting our local paper, the Stroud News and Journal, to publish an article about the walk. Scope had sent a fund raising pack, which included a sample press release. Over the next few weeks it seemed as if most of Stroud was doing a charity hike of some sort or other. Each Wednesday, I would open the Stroud News, and another story about someone doing a sponsored hike in some exotic location or other would nod a familiar greeting: "a man/woman from ... is undertaking a walk on behalf of ... and has pledged to raise..... he says 'This is certainly going to be a challenge'...." 
<P align=justify>Rather than send in yet another standard press release, Wendy wrote an article about why so many Charities were organizing these events, cleverly incorporating the main points of the press release into the article. She titled it 'Another Stroud man strides out'. We discussed whether we should say anything about me having Parkinson's disease. I didn't want to make a big deal out of it; Wendy on the other hand felt we should say something. In the end we put in a sentence that said: 'Donald has some personal experience of disability for he developed Parkinson's Disease at the age of 36'. That one sentence had a profound effect. It enabled us to come out in the open about my Parkinson's disease. We had discussed my condition with our close friends and family, but it was  not something that you could just drop into the conversation with neighbours and acquaintances. They could see that there was obviously some thing wrong with me, but, like a bereavement, no one liked to mention it. Now there it was in the paper. It was no longer a taboo subject. 
<P align=justify>The nicest thing about the fund raising was how helpful and kind every one was. People I hardly knew gave me cheques. Jan, in the village, opened up her garden for the day to raise funds in aid of my walk. Our neighbour, Vera Harvey, had an article put in the parish magazine, helped with our jumble sale, and in many other ways. In fact so many people helped in so many ways, thanks to them I was able to raise over £4000.<BR>
<B> Wendy's press release, December 1997:</B><BR><BR>
<CENTER><B>Another Stroud Man Strides Out<P align=justify></B></CENTER>
In recent weeks, the Stroud News and Journal has covered the stories of several local people trekking for charity in many exotic parts of the World. Donald Gordon from Box is another person aiming to raise at least £2000 for SCOPE (formerly the Spastic Society) when he travels to the Sinai Desert in Egypt next year to join in an organised trek across the desert from the Red Sea to mount Sinai.
<P align=justify>This new phenomenon of  foreign travel, adventure, fitness and fund raising, is an initiative many charities have had to come up with since the advent of the National Lottery three years ago, when it sadly became an accepted fact that people were no longer giving to charities in the traditional way. 
<P align=justify>Unfortunately, planning travel to exotic locations is not always without difficulties. Since the tragic massacre in Luxor last month, SCOPE have had to reschedule a planned sponsored cycle along the Banks of the Nile and are carefully monitoring the situation in Egypt.
<P align=justify>Donald Gordon is hopeful that his trek across the Sinai will not be affected by the political events. As a student he spent a year on a kibbutz in Israel and traveled extensively in the Sinai, much of which was then part of Israel. He said that the area was very sparsely populated apart from a few nomadic Bedouins. As it is not a renowned tourist area it should be safe from the recent trouble. 
<P align=justify>Donald his wife Wendy and three children Callum, Jack and Rory, are busy raising money for the charity. So far a series of progressive charity lunches have taken place and a Christmas Bring & Buy Sale and a Race Night in January are planned. Many local companies have been very generous in donating gifts for raffle prizes (Debonhair, Dursley Swimming Pool, Estee Lauder, Gloucester Rugby Football Club, M.J. Fews, Rackhams, Sainsbury's, and Tubby's). The Gordon's are also grateful to all their friends and family who are also supporting their fund raising. 
 <P align=justify>Scope is the largest charity working with people who have cerebral palsy, their families and their carers. In the four weeks before Christmas it is estimated 100 babies will be born with cerebral palsy in Britain. SCOPE only has enough money to help 25 of them. Donald has some personal experience of disability for he developed Parkinson's Disease at the age of 36. He is keen to raise as much money as possible before the end of January.

<CENTER><U><B>Chapter 2 - 	That day, at last</B></U></CENTER><P align=justify>
Saturday 28th March arrived like an express train, and as I made my way to Heathrow airport that afternoon, my head was spinning from a cocktail of emotions: excitement, anticipation and I don't mind admitting a fair amount of trepidation. 
<P align=justify>I met my thirty-three fellow walkers, and the two Scope organisers, Sara and Kate, for the first time by the El Al desk at Terminal one. They seemed like a nice group of people, and we began the process of forming friendships that would blossom over the next six days. We were each given five Scope T-shirts with the words 'Egypt Hike Away 100Km, 28th March to 5th April 1998' emblazoned across them. This was our uniform for the week.  
<P align=justify>To my surprise, out of the 34 participants there were 26 women. Though, I must say that against all my expectations it made a very pleasant change being the token man for once! 
<P align=justify>We all waited in line to get the third degree from the El Al's security: 'did you pack your bag?' 'Has any one given you anything to take with you?' 'Where will you be staying in Israel?' 'What colour underpants are you wearing?' etc. etc. etc. Then congregated in a seedy departure gate bar, paying inflated prices for Spanish lager while we waited for our flight to board: <I>"Hello my name is Donald Gordon, did you have far to come...."</i> Drink another beer. I feel my eyes burn with fatigue. The pills are starting to bite, and I dance a tormented gig. It's time for the puppet master to pull a few strings, to let you all know who I am. 
<P align=justify>At last we boarded an El-Al Boeing 747, for the night flight to Tel Aviv. 
<P align=justify>I was sitting between Christine, a retired school teacher, a grand mother and one of the oldest members of our party, and Rebecca, who I had met two months previously at a pre walk briefing in London. Rebecca, as she explained to me on the flight, was in the process of trying to rebuild her life, and this was the start of a trial separation from her husband. I made suitably sympathetic noises, and then at the first opportunity slipped on my courtesy headphones, tuned into the music channel and turned up the volume. Nothing happened, I turned the volume up some more, but there was still no sound. Christine, on the other hand, was woken up abruptly by Dire Straights blasting out of her headphones, and politely requested that I stop playing with the controls on her seat arm. I apologized profusely, ordered a drink, and then made a start on my journal.
 <BR><pre>
<B>Flight to Tel Aviv</B>

Looking out the window at Millions of lights, 
electronic grains of sand
surrounded by land.

I sit regally on my aviation throne,
while international handmaidens
deliver cocktail delights.
Have a nice flight.

The engine's roar sets the mood. 
As we skim from cloud to cloud,
eating kosher jigsaw puzzle food.

I've been stalking sleep for nights on end,
but can never hold that elusive friend.
So I sit here awake in my seat,
in the warm glow of anticipation
of the outward bound flight.
Cruising at thirty thousand feet.
</pre>
<P align=justify>
We landed at Ben Gurion airport at four in the morning, and hung around in the transit lounge for what seemed like hours. I sat there in no-mans land caught between sleep and the excitement of a new adventure. To keep myself awake, I got out my Psion organiser and started a new document, called departure. Tapping with one finger, I fired off words, in a point and shoot sort of a way. (My handwriting was never very good, and now with Parkinson's disease, it's completely shot. However, every dark cloud has a silver lining, and my silver lining is a little Psion 3a that I bought five years ago. I use this as an electronic notebook. It goes everywhere with me, and has never missed a beat. So Mr. Psion if you're listening, thank you.)<BR><BR>

<I><B>Departure:</B><P align=justify>
Dead beat, sit in the transit lounge listening to the announcers bird song. Floating in an international haze, brain too strapped to talk, legs too stiff to walk. <P align=justify>
Board a little Dash5 with some trepidation, and watch the four turbo prop engines come to life. Taxi for what seems like hours - are we driving to Eilat? Then we finally line up for take off. I'm expecting a long take off, we shake like hell and then we're up. The plane climbs like a diesel lorry straining up a steep hill in first gear. Finally hit the clouds, a bit of turbulence, then we are through. Floating above cotton wool icebergs, sun rays shoot over the horizon. At 1200 feet we vibrate to the engines beat and tingle my walking boot shod feet. Enjoy the flight. You old metal bird.<P align=justify>
Start to make our decent: drop below the cloud, and the Negev bursts out in front of me: sandstone mountains, sand dunes and one long ribbon of a road, farms form green patches on the orange karki landscape. Old bird bounces and shakes.
</i><P align=justify>
On our arrival in Eilat, we were met by Giddion, the representative from the tour organizer, Classic Tours, our mentor and resident comedian for the week. It was also here that we encountered the first, and what some, including me, would say was the ultimate challenge of the trip. This was the border crossing from Israel to Egypt at Taba. This involved copious filling in of forms, waving of passports, standing in queues and  searching of bags - and that was just to go to the toilet!<P align=justify>
<P align=justify>Two hours later, we staggered out the other end. A large dusty billboard poster shouted welcome to Egypt at me as I boarded our coach. Next stop was Nuweiba, a beach resort on the southwestern Sinai coast, where we were to spend our last night in civilization before starting the walk.
<BR><CENTER><HR></CENTER><BR><U><CENTER>
<B>Chapter 3 - 	Nuweiba	</B>	<P align=justify>	</CENTER></U>				
We drew up at the Nuweiba Holiday Village, with a hiss of brakes, disembarked and retrieved our rucksacks from the bowels of the coach. Like a teacher handing back homework, Gideon stood in the Hotel lobby giving out room keys,.  'Could do better 6 out of 10, you are in room 37'. I had been paired with Phil, and we waddled off together to find our room. 
<P align=justify>The hotel consisted of a large modern reception area, fronting a courtyard of bungalows set back about fifty yards from the beach. After a few false starts, we eventually located our bungalow and gratefully dumped our bags on the ground. The room smelt a little musty, but looked clean and reasonably comfortable. There were two single beds, a refrigerator, that worked, and an en-suite-bathroom with little sachets of shower gel and shampoo, together with those mini bars of soaps, wrapped up like Swiss chocolate, that are such a common part of the flora and fauna of hotel bathrooms every where. The only things it lacked were tea and coffee making facilities, and a trouser press. Which was a shame as I was gasping for a cup of tea, and my walking shorts were terribly creased. 
<P align=justify>Phil was in his late forties.  He told me that he had spent a number of years in the RAF, servicing aircraft, before starting up his own business. Being ex services he was well prepared, and had a Swiss army knife with enough tools to service a Jumbo jet. We discussed the merits of different types of walking socks, had a quick wash, changed out of our travel weary clothes and then went in search of the restaurant and lunch.
