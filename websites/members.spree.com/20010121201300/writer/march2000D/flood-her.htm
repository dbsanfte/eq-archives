for her<P align=justify>
(who is everything that is ever dreamed, ever wanted, and more... almost.)
<P align=justify>
a man walks down a street. it’s cold. the air is crisp, fresh, smooth. the pavement on the street beside him is dark like always. the street lamps make the dark of the pavement light enough to see. they light up the dark around him. funny thing about lights that, he thinks quietly. or maybe he thought that loudly. it’s hard to tell with thoughts. funny how that thought just popped in the picture, he thinks again. considering where his thought were before, it seems odd to him that this might jump into his mind. just one of those stupid misnomers of life and the thinking brain i guess.
<P align=justify>
he is walking fast but wanting to walk slow. he is wanting to stop, to wait, to listen, to feel. he is wanting the thoughts in his mind to become real. the dream and fantasy. he wants to turn around and be surprised and feel weak at the knees. he wants to turn around and around and around until he’s dizzy and delirious. he wants it all. he wants everything. he wants it to be just like that. like everafter and like joe and suzanne. to turn around and be blasted in every sense, through every sensation, and to have your entire life thrown into an absolute sandstorm, a blizzard, a tsunami, a Bermudan triangle, lost in love.
<P align=justify>
he feels like he’s known her forever. in reality he only knows her from a half life time of half-experiences. more than enough time to make a complete jackass of himself. or maybe enough to be relevant.
<P align=justify>
he’s come so close to just breaking down before her. he wants it to be magical. it has to be magical. it has to be like a dream that you can’t remember. the kind that you have only in the moments before you wake. a dream so vivid and elusive that to remember it alone is a victory. and if this dream was ever to be discovered, it would most surely be the ethereal hand of an unknown god, guiding the poor children of the minds that contain it together at last.
<P align=justify>
he stops at a cross walk. a van drives by around the corner. he stops and turns and is reminded of joe. he is a lot like joe. he knows who he sees and that he likes and wants that vision. he even more like joe because he didn’t take the chance where the chance existed. chances don’t exist unless you take the chance. he knows that now. he even knew it yesterday before the chance was there. he really would like to know what he’s so afraid of.
<P align=justify>
he envisions her running up behind him. she grabs him and turns him around. he’s caught off guard. I just had to catch up to you, she says. I have to tell you I love you. I have to tell you or else I can’t live with myself. she says all this and he’s stunned. so stunned she thinks he despises her. she turns to leave. she is ready to explode into tears. ready to collapse right there and end it all. then he speaks. he can’t say what he wants to say correctly. he wants to just blurt out how she is everything to everyone. how she is everything to him. how it drives him crazy thinking about her because he wants her so bad. wants her to want him so bad. so bad that at night when he lays there in his bed she pops into is head without him even thinking about her. how she intrudes on his thoughts and distracts him to the point of insanity.
<P align=justify>
he wants it all. he wants the fairy tale. he wants the passion he’s suppressed for so long that he’s almost forgotten what it feels like.
<P align=justify>
almost forgotten. but not quite. not nearly enough to lose the hunger for that place inside where all the things that mattered before completely cease to exist. he’s felt that before. different girl. different time. a long time... but not a different place. and that adventure into oblivion was one he lost completely and it killed the dream. well, not killed. just viciously maimed and tore to shreds.
<P align=justify>
he’s ready for it now. he knows what he wants. it’s for her. she. the one for whom he stop bullets with his bare hands. but even still, somehow, she isn’t his and he isn’t hers. not yet.
<P align=justify>
probably not ever.
