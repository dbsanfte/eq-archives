SUNDAY BELLS
 					
<BR>
                       
   <FONT size="+2"> © Elisha Porat</FONT>

<BR><FONT size="-1">translated from the Hebrew by Alan Sacks</FONT>
<FONT size="+1">
<BR>
<P align=justify>
Church bells ring on Sunday morning. Their peculiar tones float across the Iyoun 
Valley and through the hills. The heavy bells hang from vaulted spires. A devoted 
Maronite bellman works the rough wooden pedals at his feet.
<P align=justify>
   Metula isn't far. Kiryat-Shmona also is within sight. And If the sun this warm, dry 
winter 
isn't too blinding, one can make out the pale blue outlines of the Mountains of Naftali 
far 
on the southern horizon. Narrow roads glint in valleys flashing spring greenery. Down 
there, the convoys pass. Cavernous "safari" buses, shifting jeeps and here and there 
in 
the column the bright car of some contractor hurrying home heedless of the danger 
signs around.
<P align=justify>
   The air is full of the sound of bells, a weighty, metallic clang that leaves long echoes 
in 
its wake. The jewish Israeli ear is unaccustomed to this sound. Yet it has its virtues. 
For 
example, it cuts through the short, explosive bursts of rifle fire. It dulls the piercing, 
starling blast of a deadly charge of dynamite. It drapes a comforting, lovely wreath 
over 
the snow-capped hills scored by deep streams. And at least for these Sunday 
morning 
hours, it makes us forget that this is no nature film for seekers of solitude. That it is 
neither a poetic preface to a reservist's letter to his forlorn family nor colorful 
background material for a roving TV cameraman. Nor even a divine sand table dazzling 
in its beauty.
<P align=justify>
   The pocket military quids call this region: "the gateway to the valleys". Several 
valleys 
here merge like fingers on a fist. South of here, they dissolve into the warm, pleasant 
Hula Valley. To the north, the confluence splits into the Hatzbani, Iyoun and Litani 
Valleys. Farther on, below Jabal Barukh's snowy ridges, it all goes by the malevolent 
general name of the Lebanon Valley.
<P align=justify>
   But the lyrical title, "the gateway to the valley", arouses associations for me. The 
gateway of grief, for example, and the gateway to suffering and the gateway to tears. 
The threshold for a powerful sensation that takes hold on entering through the "nipple" 
gate. "It's deep inside," the young soldiers say. Deep in what? This "inside" is 
shorthand 
term discouraging details that add nothing. "Inside. Go on in and you'll soon feel it." 
You'll soon sense it for yourself. No further explanation will be necessary. Whether you 
tap the back of the man behind you, shrunken the little car racing through the 
roadsblocks. Whether you climb to the observation post atop the building, choking 
under your belts and gear, or you just sit here on the cliff side facing the fluttering 
jagged shadow of Beaufort Castle.
<P align=justify>
    There are no mistakes here. This is southern Lebanon. A Sunday morning like this 
one, bathed in golden sunshine and flooded as far as the horizons with the sound of 
tolling bells. Above the cross emblazoned steeples and the red tiled roofs of the village 
churches. This is Lebanon now. A dangerous pairing of sweet illusion and cruel 
explosion.
<P align=justify>
    These have been an idle hour's thoughts. That's enough now. It's getting late and I 
must rush off for our patrol.
