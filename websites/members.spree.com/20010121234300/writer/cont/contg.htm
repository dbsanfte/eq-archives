 I have been writing for 3 years on the Internet. though I do have BA in
 economics, I have taken to writing poetry. I took it upon myself to teach
 myself the craft and work hard at it. of late I have had some success in
being published. I did copyright my first volume of poetry "<I>THE MOON AT NOON,
 REFLECTIONS ON AN ICY POND</I>".  I have done a small self published chapbook
with graphics called "<I>SECRETS OF THE ORIENT OR COPING THROUGH LIFE VIA POETRY</I>".
I do performance poetry and have been on Internet radio two times on
<I>Galinski's GO POETRY!</I> channel, I have read and been featured in Borders Book Stores
on Long Island NY under the auspices of the Long Island Performance Poets
 Association. I did contribute to a CD-ROM on how to write poetry published
by Kurweil's Technology. I have been published in chapbook anthologies like
 <I>Memorandum, PIF, Stand Alone, Silver Blue Dementia, Writers Brew, and
Chainsaw Orgasms.</I> I am on many web sites including the Guggenheim Museum's
Reverie, Brooklyn Poets, and many more. I often post to assorted newsgroups like
 rec.arts.poems, alt.poetry.comments, and assorted Zen/Tao groups. I enjoy
 showcasing my works on America Online chat forums, and have been featured
on Poetic Spotlight. as far as my interests, I like to read books on
philosophy, especially those with an Eastern slant and enjoy The Best American Poetry
 anthologies, (published by Simon & Schuster). I have done live poetry
contests (slams) on line (where I usually participate as a judge) and once did the
 NEWRICAN CAFE on the lower east side of Manhattan
