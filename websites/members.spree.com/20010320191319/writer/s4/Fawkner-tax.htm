<P>Yay! It's tax time again (or near enough). I can't wait. Just love 
this stuff. Not! OK, I know it's boring, I know your eyes glaze 
over at the mere thought of all those forms and paperwork but it 
has to be done so let's just bite the bullet and get on with it.</P>
<P>
Now let's start with the fact that there's no substitute for a 
qualified professional when it comes to this sort of stuff so I'm 
not going to attempt a comprehensive survey of everything you 
need to think about when it comes to tax and your home business. 
What we're going to look at in this article is *one aspect* of home 
business taxation in the U.S.: the home office deduction. By 
having a working knowledge of this deduction BEFORE you hand 
everything over to your accountant will not only save both of you a 
lot of time (and therefore expense), you will be able to make sure 
you're keeping good records for everything you need to. Although 
this article considers U.S. tax law, many other countries have 
enacted similar laws so if you're outside the U.S., check with your 
local tax office to see what comparable deductions may be available 
in your country. I know, for example, that the Australian home 
office deduction is very similar.</P>

<P>I figured a good place to start researching this article was the IRS 
itself. Clever, no? There's a pretty handy flowchart at the IRS site 
that sets out quite clearly the elements you need to satisfy in 
order to deduct the business use of home expenses, so we'll 
just follow that. If you're interested in checking it out for 
yourself, it's at<BR> http://www.irs.gov/forms_pubs/graphics/15154t01.gif.
</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial Alternative" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">WHAT IS A HOME?</FONT>

<P>For the purposes of the home business deduction, a "home" 
means a house, apartment, condo, mobile home or boat as 
well as other structures on the property such as a garage, 
shed or barn. It does not include property used exclusively 
as a hotel or an inn.</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial Alternative" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">
IS PART OF YOUR HOME USED IN CONNECTION WITH 
A TRADE OR BUSINESS?</FONT>

<P>If not, you can't deduct business use of home expenses. Duh. 
Stop reading now.</P>
<P>
In order to satisfy the trade or business use test, you must use 
part of your home in connection with a trade or business. So 
far so good. But if you use your home for a profit-seeking activity 
that is not trade or business, you cannot claim a deduction for 
the business use of home expenses. A good example given by 
the IRS is research you undertake for your own private 
stockmarket investments. Although this is a profit-seeking 
activity, you are not involved in the trade or business of 
stockbroking or dealing and so you cannot claim the home 
business deduction.
</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial Alternative" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">IS THE USE REGULAR AND EXCLUSIVE?</FONT>

<P>OK, this is where things get a little trickier.</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial Alternative" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">The Exclusive Use Test</FONT>
<P>
To qualify under the exclusive use test, a specific area of your 
home must be used solely for your trade or business. It can be 
a separate room or part of a room but it need not be marked off 
by any form of permanent partition.</P>
<P>
So, if you have an "L" shape living room/dining room area 
and the dining room area is hived off as your "office" and is used 
for no other purpose, then this satisfies the exclusive use test.</P> 

<P>If, however, you clear the dining table of your papers every night 
so the family can use it for dinner, you don't meet the exclusive 
use test. So confine family meals to the kitchen! Easy.</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial Alternative" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1"> Exceptions to the Exclusive Use Test</FONT>

<P>The only exceptions to the exclusive use test are if you use 
part of your home for the storage of inventory or product 
samples or as a day-care facility.</P>
<P>
If you use part of your home for storage of inventory or product 
samples, although you don't have to satisfy the exclusive use 
test, you must meet all of the following tests instead:<BR>
* you keep the inventory or product samples for use in trade or 
business; <BR>
* your trade or business is the wholesale or retail selling of 
products; <BR>
* your home is the only fixed location of your trade or business; <BR>
* you use the storage space on a regular basis; and <BR>
* the space you use is an "identifiably separate space" suitable 
for storage.</P>

<P>Therefore, if you store your inventory of knitting wool for your 
internet business of selling wool, knitting patterns and knitting 
needles in your basement, then you will still be able to deduct 
your basement expenses (or part of your basement expenses) 
even though your basement is also used as a recreation or 
workshop area.</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial Alternative" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1"> The Regular Use Test</FONT>

<P>In addition to satisfying the exclusive use test, you must also 
satisfy the regular use test.</P>

<P>This means that you must use the specific area of your home 
you use exclusively for business purposes on a continuing basis. 
This means more than occasional or incidental use.</P>


<FONT FACE="Arial Alternative" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">IS IT YOUR PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS?</FONT>

<P>Your home will be your principal place of business if you use 
it exclusively and regularly for the administrative or management 
activities of your trade or business and you have no other fixed 
location where those activities are conducted.</P>

<P>"Administrative or management activities" include activities 
such as billing customers, keeping books and records, ordering 
supplies, setting up appointments, forwarding orders or writing 
reports.</P>
<P>
Furthermore, and this is a recent change in the law from 1999 
onwards, even if certain administrative or management activities 
are performed outside your home, you will not necessarily be 
disqualified from satisfying the principal place of business test. 
You may, for example, engage third parties to conduct your 
administrative or management activities at other locations. An 
outside bookkeeping service is one example. You may also 
conduct some of your management or administrative activities 
from your car on your cellphone without disqualifying your home 
as your principal place of business.</P>

<P>Alternatively, if you conduct your business at more than one 
location, whether your home can be considered your principal 
place of business depends on a consideration of the relative 
importance of the activities performed at each location. If this 
is not determinative, you can then take into account the time 
spent at each respective location.</P>

<P>If, after conducting this analysis, you home can be identified 
as your principal place of business then, provided you also 
satisfy the trade or business and exclusive and regular use 
tests, you can deduct home office expenses.</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial Alternative" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">
IF NOT PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS, DO YOU MEET 
PATIENTS, CLIENTS OR CUSTOMERS IN YOUR HOME?</FONT>

<P>Even if you can't meet the principal place of business test, 
if you use your home to meet with patients, clients or 
customers in the normal course of your business, you may 
still be able to claim the deduction. 
</P>
<P>You can deduct expenses for the part of your home used 
exclusively and regularly for business if you physically meet 
with patients, clients or customers in your home and their 
use of your home is "substantial and integral" to the conduct 
of your business.</P>
<P>
This means that the use of your home for occasional 
meetings and telephone calls is not sufficient as the use of 
your home is not substantial and integral to your business.</P>


<FONT FACE="Arial Alternative" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">IS IT A SEPARATE STRUCTURE?</FONT>

<P>You may deduct expenses for a separate free-standing structure 
such as a garage if you use it exclusively and regularly for your 
business. It does not have to be your principal place of business 
or a place where you meet patients, clients or customers.</P>

<P>For example, if you're an internet consultant whose principal place 
of business is at an office downtown, but you also use your garage 
exclusively and regularly as your home office for reviewing client 
websites and writing reports in relation thereto, you can claim the 
home office deduction for expenses associated with your garage.
</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial Alternative" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER</FONT>
<p>
To summarize, then, to qualify to deduct expenses for the business 
use of your home, you must satisfy the following tests:

<BR>1. Your use of the business part of your home must be:
<BR>
(a) exclusive (unless the storage of inventory or day-care 
facility exceptions apply); AND <BR>
(b) regular; AND <BR>
(c) for trade or business</P>

<P>AND</P>

<P>2. The business part of your home must be one of the 
following:
<BR>
(a) your principal place of business; OR 
<BR>(b) a place where you meet with patients, clients or customers 
as a substantial and integral part of your business; OR 
<BR>(c) a separate structure such as a detached garage you use in 
connection with your business.</P>


<FONT FACE="Arial Alternative" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">CALCULATING YOUR BUSINESS USE</FONT>

<P>Calculating your business use of the area of your home that 
you are using exclusively and regularly for business purposes 
is not complicated. First, calculate the percentage of the business 
area of your home as a proportion of your total home area.</P>

<P>Next, add up your rent or mortgage interest, utilities, repairs and 
maintenance, insurance and property taxes. Finally, multiply the 
total by the percentage you calculated above. If you own your 
home, you can also include depreciation on the business 
portion of your home.</P>

<P>Note though that you cannot deduct your home office if you have 
a loss from your business or if you would create a loss by 
claiming the deduction. If you find yourself in this situation, never 
fear. Any expenses you can't claim this year can be carried forward 
to future years.</P>


<FONT FACE="Arial Alternative" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">WHETHER TO CLAIM THE HOME OFFICE DEDUCTION</FONT>

<P>So, that's the home office deduction in a nutshell. Not too 
difficult, is it? Should you claim it? Why or why not?</P>

<P>To help you answer these questions, let's wrap up with a quick 
look at the pros and cons of claiming the home office deduction.</P>

<P>First, the big con. Claiming the home office deduction increases 
your chances of being audited. So, be sure that your claim 
is legitimate before you claim it because the odds are relatively 
higher that the IRS will come knocking on your door. Don't let 
that stop you if you have a legitimate claim that's worth claiming 
though as there are some significant advantages in claiming your 
home office even after you consider the fact that your mortgage 
interest and real estate taxes are already tax deductible.</P>

<P>To begin with, deducting as business expenses what would 
otherwise be personal expenses reduces not only your income 
tax but also your self-employment tax. Next, if you claim for a 
home office, you can deduct rent, utilities, insurance and 
depreciation which you couldn't otherwise take as expenses. 
Finally, a home office allows you to deduct more car expenses 
because it allows you to claim the miles you drive from home 
to your first business stop of the day and from your last stop 
of the day back home. This would otherwise be undeductible 
commuting mileage.</P>

<P>
Tax law is not a favorite subject of many people, I hazard to 
guess. But, dry and brain numbing as it is, strive to have at 
least a working knowledge of the fundamentals. This can help 
you structure your business from the outset in a way that allows 
you to take maximum advantage of the tax laws that work in 
your favor and to minimize those that may work against you if 
you don't plan your tax affairs effectively. A good accountant is 
your best ally when it comes to tax. This article has hopefully 
given you a working knowledge of the fundamentals of the home 
office deduction but consult your accountant as to your own 
particular circumstances.</P>
