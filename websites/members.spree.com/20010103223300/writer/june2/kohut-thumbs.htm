	  <P> Gail bustled around the kitchen finding little treats to place in her son's Superman lunch box.  She glanced at Jace eating his breakfast at the kitchen table.  Her heart knocked hard against her ribs.  A lump the size of New York filled her throat and threatened to choke her.
  </P> Her first-born's first day of school.  She watched for signs of nervousness in her son, but she detected none.
  <P> Tory, Jace's younger brother by a year and a half, was testing the hockey puck capabilities of his Cheerios by shooting them across the table at his brother.  Jace, cloaked in his new, grown-up persona, ignored him.
  </P> <P>Gail stood behind Jace and tried to smooth his cowlick for the fourth time that morning.  Finally, she gave up and let the stubborn tuft of hair stand, defiant and alone.
 </P>  Her baby was going to school today and she didn't think she could stand it.  She wasn't ready to hand him over to another woman's care, even that nice Miss Taylor, whom they had met last week.
   <P>Memories flashed through her mind.  Jace as a newborn, scrawny and pink screaming in outrage at being immersed in a tub of warm bath water; his first steps, wobbly and unsure, but triumphant, nonetheless; the first time he said 'Momma'; the look of terror at his first glimpse of Santa Claus; and how he had gently held his baby brother when Tory was born.
</P>   <P>Jace's spoon clinked in the empty cereal bowl.</P>
   <P>"Okay, Mom, I'm done.  I'm ready to go to school."  He looked up at his mother with expectant blue eyes and a milk moustache.
</P>   <P>Gail smiled.  "Let's get you cleaned up.  Then, you'll be ready to go."</P>
   <P>Jace reached for the face cloth--Mr. Independent--but Gail gently wiped his face herself.</P>
  <P> Holding hands, Gail and her two boys trooped out to the bus stop at the end of the long driveway.
</P>   <P>The huge, yellow bus pulled up and her fears returned.  She wanted to take Jace to school herself, but the Principal insisted that she let him ride the bus on his first day.  She understood why.  She had two sisters who were teachers.  They had explained the horrors of a mother standing in the classroom doorway with a screaming child clinging to her leg.  Hysteria spreads like wild fire among four-year-olds.  Gail knew Jace would never do that, but she understood he needed to learn how to go to school without her.  It didn't make it any easier to let him go.
</P>   <P>When the bus door folded open, Gail hesitated.  How could she send her child off on a bus with an unknown driver, to a foreign place filled with strangers?
</P>   <P>She looked up at the grandmotherly face of the bus driver and relaxed slightly.</P>
   <P>"Hi, Jace.  Climb aboard."  The bus driver beamed at the small boy.</P>
<P>   Gail held him close for a moment until he wriggled out of her arms.  She helped him with the first, big step, but he climbed the rest of the way without assistance.  She looked for his face to appear in a window.
</P>   As she debated whether she should pull him off the bus and keep him by her side, she located him at a window near the front of the bus.  His face split into a huge grin, and he gave her the thumbs up signal.
   <P>Gail's heart leapt and her smile mirrored her son's.</P>
<P>   Jace wasn't nervous about going to school and having new experiences.  He was thrilled.  She knew then that he'd be just fine in his new environment.
</P> <P>  Gail and Tory waved energetically at the departing vehicle.  As the yellow bus pulled out of sight, she felt a tug on her jeans.
</P>  <P> "Jace is a big boy now, right, Mommy?"</P>
  <P> Gail bent down to her cuddly, younger son and drew him close.  "That's right, Tory."</P>
<P>   "I'm a big boy, too, right, Mom?"  His big blue eyes looked hopefully into hers.</P>
<P>   Gail hugged him tightly and she swallowed the lump in her throat.  "Couldn't we keep you little for just a bit longer?  Mommy needs a little boy to hug."
 </P> <P> His chubby arms curled around her neck and he pressed his nose to hers.</P>
  <P> "Do little boys make cookies?"</P>
   <P>Gail laughed.  "They sure do, Tor-Bear.  Let's go."</P>
   <P>She reached for his hand and mother and son retraced their steps to the house where at least one little boy remained.
