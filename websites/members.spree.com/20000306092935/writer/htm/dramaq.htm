<FONT SIZE=4><P>Women in War and Resistance: Selected Biographies</P><IMG src="/writer/gif3/women-wr.gif" width="169" height="252" align=right>
<font size=2>
<P>Author: Kazimiera J. Cottam</P>
<P>An excellent read for the general public as well as for
Military hounds. Read the biographies of over 100
women who fought for Russia during WWII.<BR>
<P>100 female heroes that many, in fact most of us have never heard of.
These stories will shed quite a different light on pre cold-war Russia,
the World  Wars, and the "typical" Russian woman.
A must read for all women's studies.<BR>
Ms. Cottam spent 20 years researching and writing this fine work.<BR>
<P>Purchase directly from the author and the publishing company she formed-</P>

<P>Women in Air War:  The Eastern Front of   World War II  </P>

<P>Editor & Translator: Kazimiera J. Cottam</P><IMG src="/writer/gif3/women-aw.gif" width="167" height="252" align=right>
<font size=2>
<P>Brilliantly researched  and written Canadian scholar Kazimiera J. Cottam
Women in Air War:  relays to us the tales  of brave women who made up the Eastern Front of WWII.  While written and researched by an expert in Women's Studies
whose specialty  is the Russian women of WWII- this book is an easy read for all. It gives us valuable insight into the nature and courage of women we have never heard of- but should have heard of. You will read biographical sketches of women dive-bombers, night bombers, and fighter pilots.
And come to know and care about each of these women and find yourself wondering why none of this information  was available to you before.<BR>

<P>Editor & Translator: Kazimiera J. Cottam</P><IMG src="/writer/gif3/defend-l.gif" width="171" height="252" align=right>
<font size=2>
<P>While I deeply enjoyed all 4 of these books, this was my favorite. We get an in depth look at a young Russian teenager through her own diaries and letters.<BR>
<P>This inside look helps to break down social barriers we may have implanted in our minds. It weaves the fabric of this heroic young girl's involvement tin the war, her great pride and honor in being involved in the protection and defense of her country.<BR>
<P>The book as a whole tells the story of 2 partisans and 1 spy. But the  story of
Ina Konstantinova told in her own words through her notes and letters is my favorite part of the book. The other 2 women detailed are inspirations as well: Masha Poryvayeva and Zoya Kruglova-Baiger.<BR>
<P>As with all of MS. Cottams books this is a must read for women's studies
and just a plain good read for the rest of us.</P>

<P>Memoirs of a Woman Machine Gunner</P>
<P> </P><IMG src="/writer/gif3/on-road.gif" width="170" height="252" align=right>
<font size=2>
<P>Another brilliant look inside the life of a true Russian hero who happens to be female. Nearly one million women served the Soviet  Armed Forces during WII, and many if not most of these women were active combatants.</P>
<P>The author fought with the famous 25<SUP>th</SUP> Chapayev Division, and provides us with an honest eyewitness account of the desperate fighting for the Odessa And Sevastopol. She was half-blinded yet she still drove herself to rise in the ranks and become a machine-gun company commander. In this book, she details the heroics of her comrades without focusing primarily on herself- though we certainly come to understand her integrity and grit.<BR>
<P>Another wonderful offering from K.J. Cottam and New Military Publishing.<BR>
