	<P>Briony had decided to enter the competition. The conditions of entry were for a story of less than 750 words beginning with the following sentence:
</P>
<P>"At first glance, it might be easily thought that the room was empty."</P>

<P>She sat back in the swivel chair and looked on the computer screen at what she had typed. There was something wrong with it somehow. Of course, the word 'easily'. It was awkward and destroyed the rhythm of the sentence. How many times had she told students on her writer's courses that 'ly' words were to be avoided? Get rid of that annoying comma too.
</P>
<P>"At first glance it might have been thought that the room was empty."</P>

<P>All very good, but where to go from here? There had to be someone in the room who could not be seen. Not at first glance anyway.
</P>
<P>-You might try hiding me behind the desk, said Judd. I wouldn't easily be seen there.</P>

<P>Judd was a character she had thought up some time ago but hadn't been able to fit into a story so far. She could see his honest face and jutting jaw and thought he might suit a rural situation.
</P>
<P>-I could be lurking behind the potted palm, said Lucy. Not easily seen in the gathering dark.
</P>
<P>Lucy was a flapper who had been invented for a twenties style whodunit which had long been abandoned.
</P>
<P>But she didn't know. It was that word 'easily' again. One person behind the desk and one behind the potted palm. Well it was a start.
</P>
<P>-I could crow in the library, said the Russet Hippalector.</P>

<P>The Russet Hippalector was a mythical beast; half horse, half Pekinese and half rooster. She had invented it for an absurdist play. It sat next door in the library eating the Encyclopaedia Britannica and crowing whenever there was a hint of sexual impropriety in the play. At least it would be next door which might lead to the assumption that the room here was empty.
</P>
<P>-We could be hiding underneath the stand, said the Cheer Party Leader. Nobody would see us there.
</P>
<P>The Cheer Party Leader and his forty-four followers had been invented for a skit she had intended to write about Rugby football fans. Unfortunately, while she was still formulating her ideas, another writer had published a skit on the same subject, but with seventy-seven fans. At least if they were hiding beneath the stand it might lead to the impression that the room was empty.
</P>
<P>-I could be standing in the middle of the room with the cloak of invisibility about me, said The Magician. Even though I am actually here, I could not be seen and it would appear that the room is empty.
</P>
<P>This presented a real possibility. The Magician was currently being invented for a morality play she was about to write. She thought he might have a floppy hat and a wand but hadn't decided on the other details as yet. He represented the formative powers involved in the creation of the universe.
</P>
<P>-I could be standing on my pedestal as a statue, said the Greek Goddess. People might think that the room was empty if all they saw was a piece of carved marble.
</P>
<P>The Greek Goddess had come to her in a dream as a child. She never wrote about religion hence there was not the faintest possibility that the Goddess could ever be used in a writing project.
</P>
<P>She checked the word count and found that there were five hundred and six words. Just about enough space for one more set of characters and the punch line. 
</P>
<P>The Two Lovers walked hand in hand over their bed of roses. These two were an eternal symbol that would never die. They were included in most of her stories.
</P>
<P>-We could be sitting in the gazebo and hardly be seen, said the female partner.
</P>
<P>-Or perhaps just exist as ripples in your mind, said the male partner.
</P>
<P>She finally realised what she had to do. She selected the shift key, shaded the entire piece and pressed 'delete'. Time to start again.
</P>
<P>"At second glance, there was no doubt about it, the room was full of people..."</P>
