<P>Stress is a natural and unavoidable feature of modern life. When the
pressures of life become too much and we can't cope, stress operates like a
screw gradually turning tighter and tighter. Often we don't realise that we
are under stress until the pressure becomes too much and the lid starts
lifting... until we crack. Humans are vulnerable and live under an optimum
level of stress every day, but they don't know how to cope when the pressure
builds up too much...but what can we do about it?</P>

               <DIV ALIGN="center"> HOW TO COPE WITH STRESS?</DIV>
<P>
Listen to your own alarm system. There are abundant challenges, demands and
opportunities in modern living, but these often cause frustration and
exasperation.
Your first step is to be aware that you are under stress. Make  a list of
all of all the major stress areas in your everyday life. Then armed with
this knowledge, make an honest commitment to changes in your life. By
identifying the causes and being open to change, you can at least hope for
improvement.</P>

                      <DIV ALIGN="center">FIND THE CAUSE.<BR>
CALL IT BY NAME, THEN YOU CAN ELIMINATE IT.</DIV>

<P>People suffering from severe stress should seek help from a doctor or
therapist. Therapists help the patient to feel differently about things. In
other words, they get them to have a different perspective. Persons
suffering from stress might do small tasks to give them a feeling of
accomplishment before returning to the work-force. All these techniques can
make people grow; just like plants don't grow unless they are watered and
cared for.</P>

<DIV ALIGN="center">WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT STRESS?</DIV>

<P>Look at your life and try to find the main  cause(es)  of your stress.  What
external event or situation is causing the problem? Or is it just your
perception?  Is it physical, emotional or professional? Self knowledge means
self help, so that once you can identify the cause of your distress, you can
eliminate it. Remember that for you to be happy, all three areas of your
life (ie.. emotional, spiritual and intellectual) need to be satisfied. You
need balance in your life. The first step is ACCEPTANCE: admit that you are
under stress and not coping with life as well as you should. Once you accept
this, the next step is committing yourself to take ACTION to relieve the
problem. Making that decision to take action is probably the hardest for
you. It is best to use a combination of strategies to combat moderate stress
(the result of daily wear and tear on the body).</P>

<P>Possible action plans are as follows:</P>

<P>1. EXERCISE regularly. A healthy, flexible body makes for a healthy alert
mind. Being physically active stimulates energy levels in the brain and
allows an outlet for your frustrations.
</P>
<P>2. Keep BUSY; this takes your mind off the problem. It is the best antidote
to deal with the problem instead of worrying about it.</P>

<P>3. Take time for yourself to RELAX, MEDITATE and  VISUALISE. Don't let
trivial problems build up and get the better of you. A quiet body is more
prone to recovery and health than an angry one.</P>

<P>4. Keep a positive mental attitude (P.M.A) that you will overcome your
stress. Your attitude will determine your thoughts and how well you cope
with life: "As I think I am." Your attitude beats facts every time. Haven't
I said that phrase before?</P>

<P>5. Watch your DIET carefully. Eat plenty of healthy foods: fruit, fresh
'veggies' and vitamins (especially B and C). Cut down on stimulants like
caffeine and nicotine; both these are drugs that build up your resistance.
Also cut down on sugar, fats and your salt intake.</P>

<P>6. COMMUNICATE with a person close to you. Open your heart to those nearest
and dearest to you. Don't suffer in silence. John Donne said, "No man is an
island unto himself." Set aside specific times to communicate and talk
honestly. Share your thoughts, worries, feelings, dreams, disappointments
and problems.</P>

<P>7. Let go of your EMOTIONS. Cry if you want to. It's natural and will help
the healing process. This applies to men also, who are socialised to keep
their emotions inside.</P>

<P>8. Keep your sense of HUMOUR and be HAPPY.</P>





           <DIV ALIGN="center">WHAT TO DO ABOUT STRESS</DIV>
            <DIV ALIGN="center"> THE 30 POINT PLAN</DIV>
<P>
1. Be positive- see problems as opportunities. Have goals and visions. Have
a positive mental attitude.</P>

<P>2. Play sports and step up your exercise.</P>

<P>3. Talk things over with someone.</P>

<P>4. Determine what causes you stress and try to eliminate it.</P>

<P>5. Become physically fit.</P>

<P>6. Balance work, home/family and recreation.</P>

<P>7. Enjoy your play and relaxation- it is precious time! Learn to delegate-
don't try to do everything yourself.</P>

<P>8. Get adequate sleep and rest</P>

<P>9. Allow yourself some relaxation and meditation time every day.</P>

<P>10. Learn relaxation techniques: systematic ways to relax.</P>

<P>11. Give yourself time to think.</P>

<P>12. Know your limits and your symptoms of stress...and how to relieve them.
Learn to say 'no' to others' excessive demands on you. Don't say "yes" when
you mean "no".</P>

<P>13. "Coast" if necessary.</P>

<P>14. Worry only about that which can be changed by you. I like the quotation
which goes something like this: "Accept that which cannot be changed by you
and let God give me the wisdom to know the difference." I often do not
follow this rule.</P>
<P>
15. Use your imagination to reduce your stress levels. Be creative.</P>
<P>
16. Learn to switch off thinking about work when you get home.</P>
<P>
17. Think about your diet and eat nutritious food.</P>
<P>
18. Learn to plan your time better.</P>

<P>19. Learn to recognise and to accept your limitations as well as the
limitations (and faults) of others.</P>
<P>
20. Learn to have FUN: you must be able to enjoy your work.</P>

<P>21. Learn to praise others and be positive.</P>

<P>22. Learn to tolerate and to forgive.</P>

<P>23. Learn to avoid unnecessary competition: you don't have to be the best at
everything.</P>

<P>24. Learn to confide in others.</P>

<P>25. Learn to accept what can't be changed in others, eg.. personality or
decisions.</P>

26. Learn to accept that some things aren't as important to others as they
are to you.

<P>27. Learn to delegate.</P>

<P>28. Learn to recognise stress. Do not become so accustomed to feeling stress
that it becomes a normal part of your life.</P>

<P>29. Have trust in other people.</P>

<P>and
finally, no matter how stressful or hopeless your situation may appear to
be...</P>


<P>30. Have FAITH IN YOURSELF AND ESPECIALLY IN GOD that things will eventually
work out for you. Just know that HE has a plan for your life and it is to do
good deeds.</P>

<DIV ALIGN="center">IF UNDER MENTAL STRESS DO PHYSICAL EXERCISES</DIV>

IF UNDER <DIV ALIGN="center">PHYSICAL STRESS DO MENTAL EXERCISES</DIV>

<P>SUMMARY:</P>

<P>We live in a culture which says that our happiness is dependent on acquiring
material things, like stereos, cars, houses, etc. We are conditioned to
think that if we are to be successful, there must be "another way" of doing
things. There is stress caused by the competition to get into the "other
world of wealth" - the one that the Jones's or neighbours seem to live in.
</P>
<P>Not all stress is bad. Stress can be harnessed as a positive force, eg..
through the adrenalin produced by athletes, dancers and actors before a
performance. If you have a positive mental attitude and high self esteem,
you can make stress work for you.</P>


<P>
It is best to use a combination of strategies when stress is a result of
daily wear and tear on the body and mind.</P>

<P>1. EXERCISE: Take time out to RELAX and visualise. Don't take things too
seriously. Some people thrive on stress. They have a natural hardiness but
they still can't control their environment - you only have control over
yourself, your behaviour and your emotional responses.</P>

<P>2. Feel CREATIVE in solving your stress problem. A quiet body is more prone
to recovery and health than an angry one.</P>

<P>3. Keep BUSY: Doing something is the best antidote to dealing with the
problem instead of worrying about it.</P>

<P>Committing yourself to making these kind of changes in your life requires
effort and courage. So reward yourself for each small step attained in
reducing your stress level. Remember, "Rome wasn't built in a day"
and<BR>

 a "journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step."</p>

<P>Stress won't go away and everyone is under some sort of stress. You just
have to live with it and cope. Have a sense of humour. Find out what makes
you happy, then BE HAPPY.</P>
