  <FONT size="+2">  ©   Len Rely<BR>

<BR><FONT size="+1">
<P align=justify>
	You've all heard about me and my employer, so instead of telling the same old story
why don't I put a new spin on things?  It's 1936 for Christ's sake, you can't just tell a story
anymore.  You have to spice it up, give it that extra something people want to see.  It's a
world of busybodies now and if you can't hold their attention they'll go busy themselves
somewhere else.  This is how the story goes.  Trust me, I was there when he flipped the
switch.
	<P align=justify>My employer and I were on the road just out of New York looking for his "big break". 
I knew he was crazy from the start thinking that laboratories and test tubes were the way
to get his name in lights, but I must admit this opportunity was right up his alley.  The
heading on the flyer read "Come see the world's leading scientists compete and test their
theories on THE FINAL PROBLEM".  Yes, immortality was a scoop, a media event
sparked by public interest.  There was no real sense in the convention or its publicity.
	<P align=justify>Vic and I traveled in a neglected trailer that I referred to as the circus wagon.  I drove
the thing while his equipment filled up the back in sort of a mobile laboratory.  It was
absolutely pouring down on this night as I fumbled with the wheel and Vic sat next to me
trying to figure out the correct route to the convention between lightning flashes.
<P align=justify>	"Who the hell decided to hold this thing out in the boondocks?"  he remarked angrily. 
"If we miss this chance I'll have to sell our friend back there for spare parts."
<P align=justify>	We cleared a turn and the road became more visible, with a high hill rising in the
distance above the trees.  On the top was a comical-looking observatory like something
out of that new HG Wells film.  The white bolts coursing down behind the building lit up
the sides like the metal sphere Vic had in the back that makes your hair stand up.
	<P align=justify>"Look at the strength of those charges..." he said in awe.  "This is a perfect night for
doing this."
<P align=justify>	With difficulty the vehicle climbed the winding road up to the building, and to our
delight there was a civilized parking lot in the back.  The rain had stopped for the time
being but the lighting continued.
<P align=justify>	"Perfect!" Vic whispered with that familiar look in his eye.
<P align=justify>	We got out, removed our raincoats and checked our suits, then cordially examined the
premises.  The lot was absolutely packed, and by the voices coming from the lit doorway
there must have been quite a party going on inside.  On our way to the back door we
passed almost enough vehicles to declare a media circus.  Then Vic was distracted by
something and meandered to the side of the lot for a minute.  I straightened my tie and
followed him.
<P align=justify>	In the first dozen parking spaces near the side of the building was an assortment of
vehicles that undoubtedly belonged to his competitors.  At least six of these each hauled
a tall rectangular object about the size of a telephone booth.  Vic approached the nearest
one and pulled the rainfly off the top to see what it was.
<P align=justify>	"What kind of convention is this?" he asked in amazement.
<P align=justify>	The object was a human-sized wooden box like the kind magicians use to make a lady
disappear.  It was bright pink and covered with glitter, and on the front was scrawled in
stunning calligraphy "THE AMAZING DEATH-DEFYING ELECTRICA".
	<P align=justify>"She'll send currents down your spine?" Vic read the rest of it in disbelief.
<P align=justify>	From the top of the box sprouted a large and rather blatant lightning rod with many
branches.  By the shape of the other covered boxes they all had a similar antenna.
<P align=justify>	"These are my competitors' devices!" he whispered with amusement.  "They can't be
serious.  This is too good..."
<P align=justify>	He wanted to give his own apparatus a quick check so he returned to the trailer and
told me to go on without him.  Seeing the flashes of cameras I ran a comb through my
hair and stepped through the lit doorway.  As I entered the first thing I saw was a group
of scantily-clad women in the center of the crowd.  I decided right then that the boss was
right, this was one hell of a good idea.
	<P align=justify>Of the eleven test subjects that the other scientists had brought with them, eight were
glamorous women with Kewpie-doll faces and plump thighs every one.  The most
outrageous model by far was Miss Electrica, who wore a bathing suit of glittering blue
with a silver lightning bolt down the front.  She had a fountain-like hairpiece resembling
blue peacock feathers, and the cameramen could not get enough of her.  The scientists
themselves looked like showmen, and I felt ashamed for ever doubting that Vic would
make it big dressed in a lab coat.  Next to these characters he looked almost credible.
<P align=justify>	Vic came in and did a double-take as I watched for his expression.
<P align=justify>	"What is this a beauty pageant?" he asked curiously.
<P align=justify>	We made our way through the crowd.  There were many simple spectators and a full
refreshment table among other fineries.  A familiar face recognized Vic and gave a laugh,
prompting him to approach with a clenched fist in his pocket that only I could see.
<P align=justify>	"Hello Victor..." the man said with a leer of disrespect.  "I must admit I'm surprised to
see you here.  I thought it was required that each of the participants be a legitimate
scientist, not an amateur who spent his youth following medical students home from
class because he was banned from the campus."
<P align=justify>	"Hello Gary..." Vic responded, his teeth clenched.  "Now that I've seen what kind of
convention this really is, I'm not surprised to see you at all."
<P align=justify>	"Oh please." Gary replied.  "There's at least one legitimate doctor here amongst the
crowd-pleasers."
<P align=justify>	"So which of these delightful vixens is yours?" Vic inquired.
	<P align=justify>"None." Gary said.  "My test subject is over here..."
	<P align=justify>I followed the two rivals to a back corner away from the party lights where a limp
figure was slumped in a chair, its face concealed by a black cowl.  Otherwise it was
dressed like a hospital patient.  This person was alive in the technical sense, but
something was definitely missing because the left arm exhibited an uncontrolled shaking
movement as I watched with curiosity.  Vic removed the black cloth from the comatose
patient's face.
	<P align=justify>"A cyclops?" he asked in puzzlement.  "Whatever for?  Why did you remove the other
eye?"
<P align=justify>	"You of all people should appreciate the irony." Gary replied.  "You're the one who
said a reanimated human being would be a monster.  I simply put my superior surgical
skills to work."
<P align=justify>	"Is the other optic nerve still in there or did you remove it from the brain?"
<P align=justify>	"It's in there and it's active." he said.  "I had other uses for it to make the brain
reanimable, and that is all I will tell you."
<P align=justify>	Gary placed the cowl back over the subject's face.
<P align=justify>	"Now, I'm curious to see your test subject." he said positively.  "Have you invited him
in here or is he unable to move about on his own?"
<P align=justify>	"He's already dead." Vic stated.
	<P align=justify>Gary's eyes widened and a smile traversed his face for only a second.
	<P align=justify>"Ha!" he exclaimed.  "Now that's a challenge!  That would be the ideal way to prove
the effectiveness of a perfect method!  I hate to break this to you Victor, but reanimation
is impossible without some amount of life already there.  If any of these pretty girls are
successful it will only take a split second for the body to be electrified and then
recharged.  Technically speaking, none of these test subjects will actually be 'brought
back from the dead'.  Why, is that what you thought this is?"
<P align=justify>	Vic turned away from him and returned to the crowd.  For the remainder of the party
he introduced himself to sneering competitors and uninterested reporters while I made
acquaintance with Miss Electrica and the other girls and wished them luck.

<P align=justify>	"Could I have your attention, gentlemen." a mellow MC announced calmly from the
back.  "It's almost time for the big event.  I'll need all of the contestants, so ladies tear
yourselves from these gentlemen's arms and I promise to return them soon."
	<P align=justify>Each of the scientists and their assistants excused themselves and made their way
through the crowd one by one into the briefing room in the back.  I followed Vic to our
seats, and when everyone was accounted for the door was closed.
<P align=justify>	The briefing room was rather small and congested.  On either side of the podium in
front of the projector screen sat a group of distinguished-looking judges accompanied by
the MC and a pair of orderlies.  Vic and I sat amongst the scientists in close quarters
around the movie projector like a knit of college students at a poetry reading.  One of the
bearded judges advanced to the podium and spoke.
<P align=justify>	"Gentlemen, you all know why you're here." he said in that pleasant voice that
announcers use at the cinema before the curtains part.  "We have gathered on this stormy
night to solve that constant puzzle which mankind has dubbed 'The Final Problem', the
question of our own mortality and the possibility of a solution.  You have all studied the
rare cases, where a human being presumed dead has turned out to be alive or even a
doctor's diagnosis proves every symptom of death and yet the patient recovers.  The
question of where life precisely ends and death begins will not be solved tonight in its
entirety, but it is our hope that one of you will touch upon the key before tomorrow
dawns, some indication that travel from the grave back to life is possible.  You have all
seen the published research that electricity seems to be the key.  That will be proven
tonight, and the man who proves it will be awarded tomorrow before the waiting world
by receiving the title of 'The Modern Prometheus' by this panel."
	<P align=justify>Vic's eyes lit up at the sound of these three words.
