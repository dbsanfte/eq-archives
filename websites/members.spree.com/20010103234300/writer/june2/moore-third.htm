	<b><P>Toddy McDow, lost son of parents Fred and Denise, got his start
traveling
with the Barnes and Short Circus in the seventies.  He graduated
from the
cotton-candy butcher's job to the persona of "Odie Dodie,"
accomplished
con-man and short-change artist. He was good enough that you could
count
your change twice and still walk away happy, but be well short by
even the
simplest of finger-math.</P>
	<P>Old man Short loved him, because he would collect half of what Odie
would
confess to being his take.  On slow nights, Odie supplemented his
piece of
the action by rifling unlocked cars during the evening performance.
People
sitting in the big top were in trances, distracted by the cracking
of peanut
hulls and dazzled by spangled spandex wardrobes. They would later
find that
the Nikon and the kid's birthday transistor radio were
missing---along with
Babs' jumbo pack of cinnamon gum.

</P>
<P>Odie would say that the stage for his con-man work had to be just
right.  He
perched his little tent in the main aisle of the midway so that the
streaming audience would have to part like the Red Sea when they
came to his
barricade.  The left fork was channeled uncomfortably close to the
tiger
cages with the big sign that said "Danger---Cats Have A Four-Foot
Reach."
The alternate path led through fresh mud, created from mushy mounds
of
melting snow-cone ice and strategically placed animal urine.

</P>	
<P>Thus it was by default that they must hover for a while at the
spider's web.
Clinging to the chicken wire loops were futile knockoff Rolex
watches,
jewelry that turned green during Captain Kangaroo the next morning,
and
Japanese cameras that if examined carefully were
leatherette-fiberboard,
with a plastic lens.</P>	
	
	<P>Odie began his pitch, salted it with some early giveaways, and
charmed
Farmer Brown's missus with necklaces made of wax and pearlized
foil. The
pitch would be progressive, from the free gifts to the
bargain-buys, with
lots of funny circus stories woven in between. Bursts of laughter
would fill
the air and mask the drone of the diesel power- plant supplying
Odie's
island with rows of amber, bug-proof lights.</P>
<P>His test of crowd hypnosis was simple. "When I can get grown adults
to sing
two stanzas of Jingle Bells in the middle of a sweltering July
night, they
are mine."</P>	
	<P>And so it was, that in every little place he stopped, Odie made his
mark on
the education of the townies.</P>
	<P>In time, Odie traded his funny circus stories for more and more
Biblical
references, and began to add scripture to his crowd-wailing. Sales
picked up
when he would clutch the Bible in one hand and the eggshell-thin
Rolex with
the other. His message was loud--- saying how the Lord wanted his
people to
"be on time for Judgement Day," and how his cameras "could capture
the
worldly evils for a picture book, to teach young Ned there."</P>
<P>People would weep on the way back to their cars at the shame of how
such a
righteous man of God had no church of his own from which to
transplant his
message to the souls.</P>	
<P>Odie had so much success now that he took on a partner, Miss Tanya
Riggs,
the tambourine-chanking cur from Spanky Don Miller's sideshow band.
He had
his eye on her for some time, and noted that when she hit that
tambourine on
her thrusting sequined hip, farmers and accountants alike would
naturally
feel for their wallets. This was a good sign---how well he knew.
The girl
obviously had a connection with the audience's need to excuse their
wantonness in a financial way, because the tip jar stayed full.

</P>	
<P>It was in Cleburne, Arkansas that Odie first shucked his tux coat
and top
hat for the white collar with no apparent button. He had Tanya
fashion her
hair into a beehive, and to dress in a white choir robe. It had a
very low,
errantly-unbuttoned neckline---her ample cleavage looking like the
filled
sails of a brigantine. Gone now was the trinket tent--- replaced by
purple
and gold billowing canvas---with room for twenty-two rows of
folding pews.</P>	
<P>Debut night brought in eleven hundred Dollars, split
seventy-thirty---or
75/25 if Miss Tanya didn't count it four times. And as if in bonus
territory, she sold forty red-naugahyde  Bibles---obtained from a
hotel-motel supplier and marked up eight-fold.  Each had been
carefully
pitched to contain Odie's autograph and a well-wishing salvation
message,
albeit rubber-stamped.</P>
<P>While most of Arkansas actually got raped in the course of the next
six
months, its victims resumed life, feeling all the more virginal
with their
touch of exposure to Cleansing by Brother Odie. Through it all,
Odie said
that the melodic sounds of wallets snapping closed---a few bills
lighter---was evidence of the Lord's beacon---guiding him on to the
hordes
of the unfaithful. "Hunnerts of them out there Lord, and your man
Dodie can
save 'em all."</p>
<p>
"Shit, I believe he's starting to believe in his own red Kool-Aid
wine,"
Miss Tanya would say of his communions, just out of Odie's earshot.
</p>
<BR><HR><BR>
<P>It was only a six page regional newspaper---The Clifton County
Brigadier-Courier, but it had two lines of comics, and the
quarter-page want
ad that was written just for Odie and Miss Tanya's consumption.</P>

        <P> "Milby-Mound, Texas, Wants Rainmaker---$5,000 Offered for
Results."
</P>
<P>At first thought, Odie wasn't so much attracted by the rainmaking
proposition, as he was the people who wrote it.  "Hell, these
people are
already singing Jingle Bells without me," he said gleefully to a
hung-over
Tanya, as they turned the big truck South on Texas FM Road 2662.</P>

<P>The Courthouse was weathered limestone, and formed the centerpiece
where ten
other buildings radiated out into tumbleweed-decorated streets.
Seven of
them were "Closed for Remodeling" or "Coming Soon's."  The
remaining three
were the staffs of life---Police and Fire Station, Tinker-Bell
Café, and
lastly, the Brigadier-Courier and Justice of the Peace Court.</P>

<P>Odie's first impression was actually not his first. What was it
about
newspaper offices that always seemed to exude a lack of
prosperity---like
the next issue would be the last---yet somehow one more can always
be put to
bed?  Why is it that every available resting place is stacked to
the peak of
one's reach, with browning back editions and nameless books and
files?</P>

<P>And why is it always a staff of one---an editor with a paunch, his
shirt
half-tucked, and black-spotted at the belt line from protruding
first-contacts with stray ink?</P>

<P>Odie Dodie and Miss Tanya, meet Silas Cannon---editor, publisher,
procrastinating nose-hair-clipper.</P>

<P>The negotiation went smoothly---Odie being the only candidate for
rainmaking. Also, it was a case of the perfect match---two of the
you-have-what-I-want engines that drive the American Economy. Odie
would
only get paid with a one-inch rain-gauged result, and in trade, he
prevailed
on his requisite for the standard three nights of soul saving on
the grounds
of the Courthouse.</P>

<P>It was a thirsty throng, and not just for rain. Miss Tanya bulged
in the
right places for the mostly cotton-crop coin purses, and in the
first two
nights, nineteen people came to the foot of the pulpit when he and
Tanya
belted out the invitational, Cast Your Net, O Lord. The last of the
nine
cases of red Bibles got sold the first night, and twenty,
cash-first
backorders were taken from the always-trusting.</P>

<P>The first two nights' successes must have leached out into the
dust-bowl
country way past the dry banks of Moccasin Creek that divided the
land into
Robinson County. Night three was shoulder to shoulder.  The
overflow had
assembled into lawn chairs and milking stools, and stretched out in
masses
as if waiting for the five fishes to be subdivided. Miss Tanya
walked the
crowds with her gold-painted lard bucket and ignored the stage,
which was a
pre-arranged tactic when crowds got past controllable collection
distance.</P>

<P>Before the Rain Prayer segment even began, Miss Tanya had to empty
the lard
bucket not once but twice, dumping Odie's suitcase and pouring in
coins and
bills.  Odie's only evidence of mortal connection, his baby blue
Fruit-0f-the-Loom's, would gladly give way to the color of green.</P>

<P>"We done good."  Tanya's favorite cliché---whispered ever so low,
would sum
it up.</P>

<P>With head bowed low and arms outstretched, he made the rain plea:</P>
<P>
"God, you have forsaken these people---you have asked them to prove
their
worth and they have done so, in the manner in which you deemed, to
toil in
dust and parched land, and to see their crops wither and die for
their
faith."</P>

<P>"We know too well O Lord by your teachings, that it is not by our
works that
our prayers will be heard, but by our endless faith that you are a
just God,
a righteous God, and you can end this suffering at thy will."</P>

<P>"Make this land whole!  Father we just thank you for these lessons
you have
conveyed to your people, and if it is thy will, bring forth your
mighty
sword and cleave the sky---make it leaden and heavy, and spill out
your
bounty of rain to this arid place of thy children."</P>

<P>"Amen, Dear God of Jehovah, Amen, and Amen," he ended.</P>

<P>The crowd seemed suddenly lifeless, as if all wind had expired from
their
lungs. The still evening air was broken only by sounds of locusts
in the elm
trees that lined the Courthouse Park. Slowly the faithful began to
disperse,
and Odie noted for the first time that the departing were not
skipping in
glee as was so long the accustomed outcome in his Jingle Bell days.
They
walked with humped shoulders, lawn chairs in tow, without so much
as a
sound, save for the clinking of car-keys in ready. A very different
kind of
exodus, he thought, but either way, the coffers were stuffed.</P>

<P>At two a.m., Miss Tanya poked her sharp fingers into Odie's ribs,
shaking
him out of his exhaustion.  He grabbed for his trousers, as her
poking was
usually the signal that it was time to pack the canvas and get out
of town
before daybreak cast the light of truth on them. Instead, she was
shouting
blue-streak expletives about the heavens---her words being
punctuated by the
wind---as it began to rip the corner-gussets from the tent.</P>

<P>In a surge, the sky was engorged with lightening like so many
illuminated
blood veins, and the wind had begun to shake the tent like a beach
towel,
pinned only on one end to a bowed and strained clothesline. They
furiously
attempted to bring it down, grabbing at the guy-wires and jerking
the
car-axle tent stakes from their dirt anchorage. Pews had begun to
collapse,
and were being peppered by wads of hail that broke through the
remaining
canvas like bullets. The center pole began to twist, and Odie and
Tanya
braced against it with all their weight to shove it across the
grass berm so
that it would fall under its own weight.</P>

<P>A light flash shot over the Courthouse so bright that for an
instant the
night sky shone as day, with a green wall-cloud meeting the black
as if a
rising curtain. Paper cups were silhouetted against the sky like
egrets
painted on black velvet---ignoring the sheeting force of rain that
attempted
to drive them fiercely back to earth.</P>

<P>Explosion and fireball followed, directed at the steel center pole
as if
guided to a lightening rod. It all disintegrated in an instant---in
one tick
of Tanya's bedside Baby Ben---the work of unchecked force and
power, pitted
against plastic and Duck tape. In that brief exchange with nature,
only the
big truck remained---resting on its top as if a turtle helplessly
flipped on
its back---the object of a child's folly.</P>
<BR><hr><BR>


<P>Silas Cannon opened the door his office, pushing hard against the
wooden
panels, which were swollen tight from the soaking rain. Inside, the
water
had intruded in puddles that luckily were conveniently congregated
in
forgiven spaces.</P>

<P>His type was set in the hour, and the proof-press reeled off the
rendition
of the front-page text:</P>




<FONT FACE="courier new" COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1"><P>Milby Mound-- Tragedy greeted residents in this westernmost part of
Clifton
County as they awakened to news of two missing persons after
torrential
rains and violent weather passed through this thinly-populated
farming
community around 2:00 a.m. today. Department of Public Safety
officials
estimated that although not confirmed as tornadic, winds possibly
reached
eighty to a hundred miles per hour before the storm moved into
Robinson
County. There will be further examination of the only reported
damage, which
was confined to the Courthouse perimeter in downtown Milby Mound.</P>

<P>"We are certain we will locate them, hopefully alive," said Trooper
Russ
Hawkins, "but freaky winds like these have been known to carry
people,
livestock, and even small cars up to fifty or more miles, once
airborne."</P>

<P>The missing are listed as Todd Lucas McDow,42,  and Tanya Faye
Riggs,27,
both of Fayetteville, Arkansas. The pair were members of a
tent-revival that
had conducted services here for the preceding three evenings.
McDow, a
self-styled rainmaker and evangelist, was under contract to the
City to
produce rain, as has been previously reported in the
Brigadier-Courier. In
his negotiations with the City and County, McDow listed previous
similar
success with rainmaking in seven other locations, which were not
verified,
since the contract stipulated payment only upon measured rainfall.</P>

<P>While the area will surely benefit from the estimated five-inch
deluge,
citizens are saddened by the possible loss of life. Interviewed by
this
paper only hours before the last evenings' revival meeting, McDow
is quoted
as saying, "If I can't bring rain, then by the Lord's own hand,
we'll have
red Kool-Aid to pour on the fields, and we will multiply our cask a
hundred-fold and a hundred-fold more."</P>


</FONT>

<P>Silas was still thinking---the newspaperman's stubborn
curiosity---and
pondering the outcome. All in all, it worked out even better than
everybody
hoped. Souls and fields were saved, and come to think of it.the
Kool-Aid.</P>

<P>He thought.If they're able, they'll be back to justly claim their
money, and
for sure they will come back for this---as he twirled a man's gold
watch
with diamond bezel between his inky fingers. The inscription on the
back
read, "To Odie: Real Rolex, Fake Man. ---Miss T."</P>
