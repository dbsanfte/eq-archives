<P align=justify>	Things weren't going at all the way David had planned them; this was apparent as he barreled down the hospital hallway, pushing the gurney, with two orderlies in hot pursuit.
<P align=justify>	"What's going on?"  Came a whispery voice from beneath the gurney's blanket.
<P align=justify>	"Nothin' I can't handle,"  David panted, "Just hang on tight."

<P align=justify>	On paper, it had seemed simple enough, and David had cased the hospital a few days, calculating the shift changes and other importances.  Just steal a gurney, a white coat, your girlfriend and we're gone.  Yeah, simple.  Alarms had gone off when he'd begun undoing her I.V.'s and other medical doodads, but he'd expected that.  His mother was a nurse and he'd learned a thing here and there from her shop talk.  But he'd never planned on playing Roadrunner to a couple of pissed-off Wile E. Coyotes.

<P align=justify>	The orderlies were gaining now and Lacy, bored with playing dead, peeked from beneath the blanket, "Holy shit!"  She said before whipping the blanket back over her head.
<P align=justify>	"What the hell have I gotten us into now?"  David said between pants. <P align=justify> Lacy reached up with her left hand and wrapped it tight around his wrist,  "I love you, David."
	<P align=justify>" I love you Sweetie..."  They were nearing a crossroads in the hall now, and David noticed the elevator sign pointing to the left.  The gurney was hauling way too much ass to make that turn, he contended, but when he saw three more medical types bee-lining straight toward them, he figured he'd chance it.
<P align=justify>	"Lacy,"  He said, bracing for the turn, "Hold on as tight as you can!"  He felt her let go of his wrist as he hefted the two back wheels of the gurney from the floor.  It went okay at first; he whipped the back of the gurney hard to the right, aligning the front wheels to the left hall.  The problems, however, arose when David realized the gurney had no intention of stopping its rightward swing, and instead had opted to crunch him between its self and the wall.
<P align=justify>	"Fuuuck..."  David winced, bracing for impact, he'd meant to warn Lacy but before he could the back of his head smacked the wall hard, sending his world spinning. Fortunately, the gurney jerked him out of this state of confusion by punching him ridiculously hard in the stomach, diswinding him.
<P align=justify>	"Lacy! You Okay?!"  He asked when he could remember how, seeing about sixteen spinning, stardanced elevators in the distance.
	<P align=justify>"Okay, ow..."  Lacy said matter of factly.
	<P align=justify>"Sorry sweetie just hold on!"  As they neared the elevator, a much needed miracle happened;  David heard the familiar ding first, before the elevator directly before them opened. Yes!  David slowed the gurney and brought it to a gentle halt inside the elevator.  He reached for the lobby button and tapped it repeatedly with two fingers.  While he was doing this, a skinny blonde man in blue medical scrubs strolled in from out of nowhere,  "Going down?" He asked David.  <P align=justify>"No."  David snapped. <P align=justify> The scrub guy glanced upward, "Arrow says you're going down."<P align=justify>  David shoved him out of the elevator just as the doors closed, "Take the fucking next one!!"  For a few seconds the only sound to be heard in the elevator was David's heavy breathing, when he'd caught his breath, he removed the blanket from Lacy's face and smiled down at her, "No problem."  He said, leaning down and kissing her forehead; just then a booming voice on the intercom began talking about a Lindburgh on the third floor.
<P align=justify>	"Any idea what they're talking about?"  He asked Lacy.
<P align=justify>	"Mm."  She began, "They're talking about us, Lindburgh means child abduction."
<P align=justify>	"Wonderful."  It was okay though, David knew where this elevator came out, right by the front doors.

<P align=justify>	As they approached the ground floor, David rocked the gurney back and forth in anticipation of his sprint.  The doors slid open and there, twenty feet away and unblocked, were the front doors.  David grunted slightly as he kickstarted the gurney into motion.  Seconds later, the front doors swished automatically outward.  David stopped the gurney just shy of the doors, grabbed a wheelchair from the wall and kicked it out of its compact position.  He lifted Lacy as gently as possible from the gurney and placed her in the chair, just then he heard the voices from behind.  He spun the chair round to face the doors, and drew his face close to Lacy's ear,  "This could get bumpy."  He said.
<P align=justify>	"I'm good." she answered, reaching up and ruffling his blonde hair.  They were outside then, he took the stairs as gently as possible, Lacy began to cough and he hated that.  Another problem, however, stole his attention from that,  "Oh shit!" He said as realization hit him.
<P align=justify>	"What?!"  Lacy asked, looking up at him from beneath ther shiny black tresses.
<P align=justify>	"I don't think I parked in this lot!"
<P align=justify>	"Yes you did."
<P align=justify>	"How do you know?"
<P align=justify>	"Because the Camaro's right over there."  She emphasized this by pointing across the lot, where the old blue Z28 sat.
	<P align=justify>"What would I do withoutcha kiddo?"
<P align=justify>	"I'm guessing here but...not kidnap people?"
	<P align=justify>"Yeah well, it's good work if you can get it."  The trip across the parking lot went smoothly and without incident, David helped Lacy into the car, rounded it, and fired it up.  As David began to speed through the parking lot, Lacy whipped the black wig off and threw it out the window.  She reached for David's hand and placed it on her bald head, "Won't be needing that anymore."  She said.  Just then David stomped the brake hard, he threw his right arm across Lacy to brace her from the sudden stop.  Standing directly before the car was a heavyset older man in a security guard uniform.  Rent-a-cop.
<P align=justify>	"Stay right there!"  The guard said.
<P align=justify>	"Get the fuck outta my way!"  David yelled out the Camaro's window.
<P align=justify>	"I can't let you do this son."
	<P align=justify>"It's what she wants!"
	<P align=justify>"It's not your decision to make."  The guard took a few steps toward the car and David revved the engine hard, "I will fucking hit you."  He said.
<P align=justify>	"Just stay there."  The guard took a few more steps and David glanced to Lacy, "You buckled up?"
<P align=justify>	"Mm."
<P align=justify>	"Good."  David released the brake and the Camaro roared into motion, leaving blue smoke and hot rubber tracks in its wake.  They were barrelling down on the guard and Lacy covered her eyes.  At the last minute though, the guard leapt out of the way into the bushes and David slowed down slightly, "Good boy."  He said.  Seconds later they were out of  the hospital's parking lot.

<P align=justify>	David took it easy through town, he obeyed all the speed limits and tried not to call attention to himself, Lacy laid across the front seat with her head on David's lap.  They were near their destination as they left town's limits, only a few more miles to the bridge over Madison's Creek.  Their place.
<P align=justify>	"We're home free now."  He told her with a smile.  It was then that the Camaro decided to disagree with him.  It lost all power, began chimmeying violently and making hellish noises.
	<P align=justify>"Oh God, no.  No please. Please!!"  David limped the Camaro to the curb, "Fuck!" He said as Lacy sat up.  They sat looking at each other for awhile, by now no doubt Lacy's dad had figured out their destination, and relayed it to the police.  They didn't have time for this but they were too close to give up now.  David kissed her softly,  "Let me have a look."  He said, popping the hood.  David stepped from the Camaro and opened its hood.
	<P align=justify>"Can you fix it?"  Lacy asked from the window.
<P align=justify>	"Not here I can't."
<P align=justify>	"We'll walk then."  She said with a smile.
<P align=justify>	"Absolutely not."  David said shaking his head, then he saw it in the distance, a car coming towards them from behind.  At first he thought it was a cop, but when it had drawn a little closer and David saw the state of it, he knew it wasn't.

<P align=justify>	Jack Hickock was enjoying the drive, idly singing along to his Shawn Mullins cassette and tapping his fingers rhythmically on the steering wheel.  As the Camaro came into view though, he turned the radio down.  He saw the kid standing over the hood as he neared; He slowed the Chevy and rolled down the passenger window.
	<P align=justify>"Everything under control?"  Jack asked.
<P align=justify>	"I think it threw a rod."  David answered glumly.
<P align=justify>	"I don't know much about mechanical stuff, but I can give ya a ride if you'd like."
David glanced to Lacy who nodded, "That would be great."  He said.  A little later  Lacy and David sat in the back seat of Jack's primered grey Chevy, "I'm Jack."  He told them.
	<P align=justify>"I'm David, this is Lacy."
<P align=justify>	"So where we goin'?"
<P align=justify>	"You know the bridge over Madison's Creek?"  David asked him.
	<P align=justify>"Sure."
	<P align=justify>"That's where we're goin'."
	<P align=justify>"Fair enough."  Jack began, before looking to David in the rear view mirror,  "What's there?"  He asked.  David reached down and took Lacy's hand in his,  "It's our place."
<P align=justify>Curiosity was beginning to get the better of Jack, but before he could ask anything Lacy was overcome by a mild coughing fit.
	<P align=justify>"Are you okay?" Jack asked, before glancing to David,  "Is she okay?"
	<P align=justify>"No."  David answered sadly, "She's sick."  A few moments later, after Lacy had recovered, David leaned forward, "Look uh...maybe you should just let us off here, it's wrong of us to involve you in this."
<P align=justify>	"In what?"  Jack asked.
<P align=justify>	"We're kind of...fugitives."  Lacy wheezed.  Jack listened as David relayed their situation, Jack had heard something about that on the radio, but hadn't been paying much attention, and certainly hadn't made the connection to these two.  After David had finished, the car was very silent, Jack looked at them in the rear view, he noticed the way David looked at her, and she at him.  He'd felt that way once...about Maggie.  She was Maggie Pruitt now but to Jack she would always be Maggie Hickock. Mrs. Jack Hickock.
<P align=justify>	"Jack?"  David finally asked.
<P align=justify>	"So Madison's Creek,"  Jack said with a smile, "Not too much farther now."
<P align=justify>	"Thank you Jack."  Lacy said.

<P align=justify>	Soon, the Chevy rolled on to the bridge over Madison's Creek.  Jack pulled to the side and stepped out.  David helped Lacy from the car and they approached Jack.
<P align=justify>	"Thank you."  David said, extending his arm to Jack.
	<P align=justify>"Wasn't nothin'"  Jack said with a smile, shaking David's hand.  To Jack's surprise, Lacy wrapped her arms around him and gave him a healthy squeeze, "Thanks again, Jack."  She said.
<P align=justify>	"Anytime kiddo."  He said, looking down into her pretty, young face.  "I'll leave you two alone now."  With that, Jack slowly stepped back to the Chevy.  The lovers stood and watched him until he was out of sight and then took their seats on the bridge.  Lacy sat on the edge, David behind her, his arms wrapped around her.  Perfect timing, David thought, The sun's just about to set.

<P align=justify>	Down the road aways, Jack smiled as he thought about the lovers.  However, a few seconds later, when he saw the police cruiser, he wasn't smiling at all.  The cruiser was headed in the opposite direction as Jack, straight for the bridge, and was going too fast to not have a purpose.  Jack swerved the wheel a bit, crossing the yellow line and getting the cop's attention.  The cruiser slowed as they passed each other and Jack yelled from the window, "Hey!!  Hey you!!"  The cop slowed down and looked at Jack cautiously.  Jack rammed his middle finger out the window,  "Hey Fuck you!!!"  Jack watched in the rear view as the cop U turned, and sped up behind him, the rooflights flashing and siren wailing.  And as Jack Hickock led the cruiser away from the lovers, he unabashedly laughed his ass off.

<P align=justify>	Jack would be okay, he would pull over after a few minutes, he would tell the officer that his friend was a cop and he'd mistaken this officer for him.  The cop would be pissed, to be sure, but no legal incident would come of it. And it would give David and Lacy the time they so desperately needed.

<P align=justify>	Back on the bridge, David and Lacy cuddled, watching the sunset.
<P align=justify>	"How are you?"  David asked her.
<P align=justify>	"Perfect."  She said, smiling and leaning against him.  The sunset was nearly over now, and Lacy closed her eyes, "I love you David."
	<P align=justify>"And I love you Lacy,"  He said as the tears welled in his eyes, "Now and forever."
<P align=justify>	"Forever..."  She said, and as he felt her breathing slow, and the sundown gave way to earnest dusk, a peaceful calm of rightness set in.
