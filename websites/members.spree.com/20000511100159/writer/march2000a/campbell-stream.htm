I gazed deeply into the crystal clear water that swirled at my feet.  I slowly reached 
for your hand and felt it's warmth in mine.  The stream was so beautiful and the
 setting of nature matched its beauty.  All alone we just sat there silent. 

I watched as the clear water reminded me of my thirst for you...never seemingly 
getting enough of something so pure and inviting.  I soon found myself lost in my 
dream as you seemed to be doing the same.  I saw the water over taking my body.
I was consumed by its life and pureness..you were overtaking me with your love.
I gave willingly to you as I let you consume me.

I soon realized that we were as one.  We were the stream of life that flowed down
from the hills and valleys.  Our joining hands were now as a ripple in the water. 
I saw you in my face as you smiled so sweetly.

I could feel each movement you made as it were within myself, then I realized
that you were me...the other part of me...giving to me and yet I giving to you.
We ran along the rocky shores.  It looked as though 
we would crash..but together we glided over them with ease.   
We sifted through the grasses along a beautiful pasture
and then close to some flowers that fed off our nourishment.
I felt like the two of us could  have no end.

Then I looked up and saw us there...holding hands by the stream.  A couple with 
a beautiful spirit.  I only saw one spirit for they had joined as one.  I saw a man and
a woman so much in love.  Their love committed and dedicated, but a much 
deeper love than I have ever seen before.  They held not each other with tight
hands..but loosely..either could have let go but did not. You see, a love so 
deep will not bind in chains....but in Love!
