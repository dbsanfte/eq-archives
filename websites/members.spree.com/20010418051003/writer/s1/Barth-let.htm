<P>Everybody and their sister wants to write a novel. Are they
capable? Sure. Will they? No. Why? They make it harder than
it really is.</P>

<P>Think back to when you were a child and daydreamed. Your
imagination soared taking you to places you'd never been or
allowed you to do things you couldn't do in real life.
Writing a novel is the same.</P>

<P>It's daydreaming one page at a time.</P>

<P>First, you come up with a premise for your novel. I came up
with the idea of someone being struck by a bolt of
lightning. A simple start but one I let my mind take hold of
and run with to produce Conspiracy To Love.</P>

<P>Next, I daydreamed about what could happen to this person.
Being intrigued with the idea of ESP throughout my life, the
next thought came. What if this person gained super natural
powers with her near death experience? Not the usual powers
but something totally different.</P>

<P>The more I daydreamed and wrote my "what ifs", the more real
my character became. I was no longer directing my character,
she was directing me. It was as if a movie was running in my
head and all I was doing was taking dictation.
</P>
<P>In sports, this would be called "being in the zone." In
writing, this is what I call being in the alpha state. The
place between consciousness and sleep. You are daydreaming
with a purpose. Your mind isn't wandering aimlessly but is
totally focused inside your head in this dream or movie.</P>

<P>Time literally seems to stand still while you are in this
alpha state. The words flow until your body starts to ache
from the waist down because of non-movement. This is when
you flip out of the zone and realize hours have gone by and
you're surprised at the number of pages you've written.</P>

<P>So you yawn, stand up, stretch and put yourself and your
writing to bed knowing this is going to happen day after
day, page after page until your novel is finished. Yeah,
right -- like your muse is that compliant.</P>

<P>Well yes, it can be if you let it. The trick to flipping in
and out of this alpha or daydream state at will is going
back over your writing each day and rewriting until your
character starts to intrude again. At first, this could take
2 hours or 2 days but it will come because your character
likes making his/her movie. And, your daydreaming is their
route to the real world.</P>
<P>
By the time you're half way through your novel, the time it
takes to flip into your alpha state will be as little as 2
to 10 minutes. Why? Because you know your character so well,
s/he is immediately there ready to let you view more of the
movie so you can take the dictation. In fact if you skip one
day to have a "real" life, count on your character berating
you for your sloven behavior.</P>

<P>Finally, the day arrives when the movie is finished. Or so
you think. Your character has other plans. S/he wants a
sequel and begins to show you another movie. So what do you
do? You let the movie run in your head.</P>
