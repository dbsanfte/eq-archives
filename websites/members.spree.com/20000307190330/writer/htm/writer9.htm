<font size=3><font color="#8b4500">
How many times have you read an article or a story and said to yourself “The same
thing happened to me !!” ? Then continued on to criticize yourself with thoughts such
as, “I was stupid not to realize that I could have written about that”<br> or “I never could of
told it as well” ?<br><br>

How often have you read a story by another person and felt immediate recognition with
their thoughts and feelings? Thinking all along, “That’s what I have always believed” or
“ I feel exactly the same way”.<br><br>

How many times has a personal experience of another person helped you to solve a
problem, or learn how to accomplish something you had felt was beyond you? Have
you ever learned coping skills, or how to overcome crisis by reading someone else’s
story?<br><br>

You should ask yourself some questions about your idea before you start the<br> writing
process :
<br>
<img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif">A. Is there a market for this type of story?
<br><br>
<img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif">B. Can I show my feelings and emotions without it becoming a rant, or a poor pitiful me
story?
<br><br>
<img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif">C. Is there anyone else who could relate to this story?
<br><br>
<img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif">D. Could this possibly benefit someone else? Could it provide a warning, or insight,
could it teach, or instruct ? Could it possibly help someone else?
<br><br>
If you answer yes to any of the above questions, here are some tips to help you get
started.
<br><br><img src="/writer/gif/chevronfire.gif"><br><br>
<font size=4><font color="#00008b">There are three basic types of personal stories that
 make good articles. <br><br> <font size=3>







<img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif">A. How to<br> 
Which is basically sharing information and experience to help someone else achieve
the same goal. These can range from How To Stop Drinking, to How To Build Your Own
Personal Web Page, or How To Get Along With Your Mother.
<br><br>
<img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif">B. Personal accounts<br> 
An experience you’ve had, or someone close to you has had, that would benefit others
through sharing. These can range from : How I Felt and Handled Breast Cancer, to What
Sexual Harassment Actually Feels Like.
<br><br>
<img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif">C. Real Life Dramas <br>
An event that has traumatized or added adventure to you life, or someone else’s life.
These can range from: Trapped On Highway 45 In An Overturned Miata, to The
Parachute Jump That Went Awry.
<br><br><img src="/writer/jpg/chevronfire.gif"><br><br>
<font color="#8b0000">Other rules for writing about personal experiences are the same as the rules for writing
a good article of any kind.
<br>
<img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif">A. Get the hook !<br> 
You have to open with a grabbing line that will interest, as well as inform your readers.
You need to let them know in a powerful and interesting way what this article is going
to be about. I.E. I was 30 years old, imagine my shock when the doctor told me, “ You
have a spot on your chest x-ray”.
<br><br>
<img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif">B. Follow the leader !<br>
Once you have the hook, you must immediately follow it up with some information
about what lies ahead. This is the crucial point to determine whether you’ve landed
your reader, or whether they are going to wiggle off of that carefully placed hook.
<br><br>
<img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif">C. Organization is essential. <br>
Try and relive whatever experience you are writing about. Draw out a timeline and be
certain that you have the events down in the order in which they occurred. You lose
credibility if you falter in this area.
<br><br>
<img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif">D. Interest <br>
The story has to hold the reader's interest. They want both fact and emotion. They are
seeking knowledge, but also seeking communion. The fastest way to loose reader
interest is to be like Joe Friday - “Just the facts ma’am” - will not work here, you have
to tie the facts together in a bundle of emotion. Tell your feelings of joy or sorrow,
apprehension or anticipation, tension or stress, or your carefree, ever-loving attitude.
The reader wants to see a part of herself here, not just the details.
<br><br>
<img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif">E. The beginning <br>
You should always end your work by referring back to the starting point, the idea that
drew the reader into the story in the first place. I. E. My battle with my foreman slowed
me down for a bit in the workplace. Now I look back and realize that I would have never
had the opportunities I now have if I was still working with that jerk.
