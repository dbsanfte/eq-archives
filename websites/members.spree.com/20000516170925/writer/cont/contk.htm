     I was born in "South Philly" Pennsylvania and now reside in Southern New
Jersey.  After high school graduation I became a mother and a wife.  At the
time, my dream career was to be a lawyer.  I figured the best place to start
would be as a paralegal so off to school I went for certification.  A friend of
mine gave me a job right after school and I worked in the legal field for a few
years.  It was very upsetting when I realized that I didn't have the stomach to
handle the career which was my dream for so long.  There would have to be some
other way to achieve the justice that I so desperately searched for in my life.

   <P>  After my divorce I drifted around for a few years trying to find myself
while taking care of my young daughter.  I was stuck and just barely getting
by.  Then I met a wonderful man while waiting tables at a diner and a beautiful
relationship was started.  We married after 6 months knowing that we were meant
to betogether.  He has given me that chance to look inside myself and
concentrate on all the healing that needed to be done.  Our 6th wedding
anniversary is June 26, 1999.
    <P> I have had several years of therapy to deal with all the horror I "put
away" during my childhood.  The process has been very enlightening.  Out of all
the pain and sorrow came a spiritual, caring, forgiving and centered woman.
The gift of creativity has always been part of my life but I learned how to use
it to heal.  Writing and drawing about my pain taught me that I could be less
and less afraid of it.  I always worried that some day the ability to create
would leave me.  Now I know that it is a permanent part of me.  In all the
growth that has occured, I found a passion for living and I now see beauty in
this world, a world which was once filled only with pain, confusion and a huge
sense of injustice.
  <P>   I hope that my writing may instill a sense of hope in those that feel
hopeless and a glimmer of trust.  Trust in that the world can be a truly
wonderful place for all of us

Currently striving hard to foster my soul in the
middle of the rat race. I find solace in the
arts--reading to meditate, writing for therapy,
paintings for inspiration, and music for all of the
above. I spend my free hours exploring the ambiguities
of life. I aim to champion lost causes and further
unpopular notions.
