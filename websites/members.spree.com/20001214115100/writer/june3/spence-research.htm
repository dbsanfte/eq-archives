	<b><P>When writing a book or article on a particular subject it is
important to have as much up-to-date information on it as
possible.</P>

<P>Before the Internet came along research involved multiple
visits to the local library, ploughing through newspapers,
periodicals and journals, and took many months to complete.</P>

<P>Fortunately the Internet can short circuit a lot of the time
and effort involved when researching. Unfortunately though
it can also slow us down.</P>

<P>With millions of websites, mailing lists, forums and
newsgroups covering just about every topic under the sun, it
can be a daunting task for a technologically challenged
author to get to the information needed for that next
masterpiece.</P>
<P>
Hopefully this article will help you find your way through
the data jungle, and help you to be more time and cost
effective by finding those sites dedicated to your topic.</P>

<P>Once you have found them you can then bookmark them in your
browser so you do not lose them again!
</P>
<P><U>Finding sites that cover your subject</U></P>


<P>The first thing to do is to locate any websites that are
dedicated to your chosen subject.</P>

<P>The AskJeeves search engine is very useful here as you can
ask a question in plain English such as "Where
can I find information on Bill Clinton?".</P>

<P>AskJeeves will return all resources that answer this
question including any websites dedicated to this topic and
associated topics (such as Monica Lewinsky!).</P>
<P>
Neat eh?</P>

<P>Try it for yourself by going to http://www.askjeeves.com</P>

<P>AskJeeves will get you started and will help you to home in
on your topic quite quickly. However this is not the only
place to look for help.</P>

<P>Libraries are still extremely important and useful resources
and many of the larger libraries around the world are now
online. Just imagine being able to browse through libraries
across the world from the comfort of your own home or
office!</P>

<P>How do you find them I hear you ask?</P>

<P>My starting point is always "LibWeb", a site dedicated to
listing links to major libraries across the globe. You can
find them at http://sunsite.Berkeley.EDU/Libweb/. They
currently link to 2,700 pages from libraries in over 70
countries.</P>

<P>To get more help then try these two sites:</P>

<P>The BBC Webguide<BR>
http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/webguide/</P>
<P>
Research a wide range of subjects at Beaucoup<BR>
http://www.beaucoup.com </P>
<P>
These links should give you more than enough material to
work with.</P>

<U><P>Keeping on top of your subject</P></U>


<P>Finding sites dedicated to your topic is only half the
battle. If you are to do your job properly as an informed
author you will need to keep abreast of the changes in your
chosen field. This you can do by perusing newspapers,
magazines and trade periodicals but this can be time
consuming.</P>

<P>Here again the Internet can help us.</P>

<P>Most newspapers and magazines can now be read online and
even better can alert you to changes and significant events
happening in your field. They do this by sending you an
email on a regular basis containing news items of relevance
to you.</P>

<P>The question we need to answer then is how can I find such
sites and start this flood of targeted information to my
email box?</P>
<P>
Well you basically need to visit the following websites.
Some of these will keep you updated for FREE, others will
charge you a fee. Take my word for it, you do not need to
pay a fee to get good quality information to your email box!</P>

<P>Try these sites for size:</P>

<P>PR Newswire - http://www.prnewswire.com<BR>
NewsBytes - http://www.newsbytes.com<BR>
PR Web - http://www.prweb.com<BR>
WebWire - http://www.webwire.com<BR>
Internet News Bureau - http://www.newsbureau.com<BR></P>
<P>
Each of these sites has a facility to register for news
updates on topics of your choice and have them sent to your
email box.</P>
<P>
Once you have registered you will start to receive press
releases, company information and news items from the major
publications around the world. You can then use this
information as the basis for your books and articles giving
the credit for your sources where necessary.</P>

<U><P>Summary</P></U>


<P>When using the Internet for your research it is important to
remember the old saying "Work smarter not harder".</P>
<P>
Hopefully this article has shown you how to do that by
getting targeted information quickly and easily without
having to sift through millions of websites.</P>
