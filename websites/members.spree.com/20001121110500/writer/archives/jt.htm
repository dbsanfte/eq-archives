<P align=justify><B>
For a few years now, her bed seemed to literally generate coldness to her. 
Her 
strategy had been to add blankets. Electric ones. Quilted ones. Even one from 
her mother in Iowa. Eventually, Ann came to realize that there could never be 
enough blankets piled up on her bed to keep her warm. So her only solution , 
a 
habit really, had been to minimize the number of hours she spent in her bed. 
<P align=justify>
The 
trouble was- Ann knew the problem. Buried underneath the blankets and the 
tennis, and the business she ran, she still knew  that this coldness was the 
empty bed sort of coldness, and it had nothing to do with temperature. 
<P align=justify>So she awakes early and leaps from her bed, not so much to get an early start 
on the day, but to escape that troubling cold. She’s a lean woman. Wiry. 
Smart. Street wise.<P align=justify> 
"In charge" would be the words most of those who work with her would use to 
paint her picture. "In charge" even to herself - that is, on the days she 
doesn’t think too much about it. Ten percent body fat, and muscles that still 
ripple, the product of too much tennis and serious exercise. She wears her 
late forties well.<P align=justify>
Thirty sit-ups on the rug, stretching exercises, and soon the big chill that 
always wraps her in her bed is forgotten for another moment.
She is not quite alone. She shares her house with Isis, an amiable cat who is 
a 
patient listener, and, as it turns out, a savvy observer. 
<P align=justify>Isis has always liked to follow Ann into her bath, the steam from the shower, 
the lure of Ann’s wet ankles and the bonus of a dropped towel being to her 
liking. <P align=justify>
Ann sings to Isis, following along piano-bar style to the radio’s country 
sounds - Ann’s weakness. Isis never whines about the flat notes. Ann’s 
long-in-the-past man often did. He has been gone fifteen years now, and so 
much of him is forgotten. But Ann still remembers the bad from this man. 
<P align=justify>Nowadays, she lives without his hundred little hurts. Without the 
humiliation. 
When the spirits of this man come a calling, as they still do, she pens them 
in by reminding them that she is, of course, her own woman, and needs not  
rely on this almost forgotten man for what , and who, she is. He left - 
actually he was taken away - those many years ago, and when he was gone, the 
hurts stopped, and that was good. But she lost, too. She lost all of the 
security that she had sought in him as a young woman. Tall men had always  
provided her with a sense of safety, and he was tall. But he was not tall 
enough, on the inside, and now he was gone. And with his departure, all her 
softness left as well.<P align=justify>
There had been another man. But he drank so darn much, that in the end, he 
was useless. So Ann went about learning her ways, and slowly, the business 
built from a crazy idea into real money. And it was her money, built on her 
work.<P align=justify>
Ann worked like a miner. The store opened at nine, closed at six, and she was 
there to open and close, and to send the sales people out into the franchise 
she had earned. She thought of herself as being a dynamo she once saw on a 
television show about Hoover Dam: wheels spinning; never stopping; power 
flowing from coppery coils. In fact, Ann had come to think of her long curls 
as actually being those copper coils, spitting out megawatts of power, 
driving her business acumen. Worse, Ann had, for quite some time now, 
convinced herself that her entire body was an engine: Pistons. Spark plugs. 
It produced power and energy for her survival, and not much else. Perfume? 
Not for Ann. Why? Machines don’t need to smell good. Dresses? Only for 
important presentations. Black dresses. Black presentations, for that matter. 
<P align=justify>There is a Catalpa tree in Ann’s front yard, and this morning, its leaves are 
reflecting the morning sun in such a way that a mottled shadow pattern finds 
its way past Ann’s window mullions and onto her bathroom floor. Lowering her 
tooth brush and closing the faucet, Ann is taken by the soft shadows of the 
tree at her feet.Transcendent shadows, it seems, because Ann is taken up by 
the patterns ather feet, and lifted into a world where animals speak.
<P align=justify>"My love, I know you." Isis purred to Ann. "And I’ve never known a woman to 
run 
away so often and with such purpose from a simple bed."<P align=justify> 
"What do you know, Isis? It’s just a bed." Ann answered.<P align=justify>
"Cats know when their loves stop being human, and become machines," Iris 
said, 
entwining herself in the leaf shadows. "Look at you. You are so unlike me," 
Isis mewed. "Do something you never do any more, my Ann, look in that mirror. 
Why be 
a machine?"
<P align=justify>The shadow pattern, the shower steam, and the undeniable realization that 
Isis 
knows her too well has taken Ann to another place, deeper inside, behind the 
wall she has built. So, she looks into the mirror, and, for the first time in 
years, she sees the woman, not the machine. They really aren’t copper 
dynamos, she finds, but curls. And so pretty. Ann looks closer. The thinnest 
of bodies, and eyes so green that even Isis, in her Siamese ways, envies 
them<P align=justify>. 
Once, years ago, a man (who was he?) had touched her breasts and told her it 
was like touching velvet pillows. Then, she pushed him away. Now, suddenly, 
before the mirror, she touches them with her own hand, as if for the first 
time, and agrees with the man whose name she can’t quite recall. 
<P align=justify>"It’s the bed, Ann," Isis said to her, curling into a towel. Machines make it 
cold. "Cats make them warm. Be a cat!"
<P align=justify> Looking into the mirror again, her nose practically touching the glass, Ann 
sees behind her image, as Isis’ words begin to push their way past the first 
old bricks of her fifteen year old wall.
<P align=justify>In the mirror now, Ann sees her reflection has disappeared, and has been 
replaced with the first pictures of the Berlin wall toppling. This time, 
however, the sledge hammers are being swung by many cats of all manner and 
colors. The cats open a breech, and then step aside, on their soft cat feet.
Through the gap, as a silvery liquid at first, then forming into a solid, is 
a 
young farm girl, an Iowan. Ann knows this girl: she ought to know this girl, 
it’s herself. Worse, Ann knows she herself had built the wall, and she knows 
why the young Ann had been sealed up behind it these many years.
This girl awakes, a soft awaking at first, then more focused, all by the soft 
ministrations of the cats who have reappeared to succor this maid to 
awareness. 
<P align=justify>This woman rises on the thinnest of feet. Naked, with arms at her side, she 
opens her palms to Ann, an invitation to explore her body. Quivering, Ann 
reaches to touch the surface of the mirror, and in doing so, she touches the 
young girl’s body beneath the mirror’s surface. She finds it a soft body - 
muscled, sweet smelling, and sinewy. It is both machine, and woman. Moreover, 
it seems so familiar, as if it is not a human body at all, but an item of 
personal possession, perhaps a ruby or a emerald, a jewel that has been long 
lost, and 
now, suddenly and unexpectedly, has been recovered.
 <P align=justify>Through the mirror, and past Ann, the girl in the mirror speaks to the cat: 
"Speak to Ann, Isis. Tell her to find me." And then, to Ann: "I’m not living 
behind this wall any more." "Shall we be us, again?"<P align=justify>
With a sudden inhalation of Ann’s breath, the young girl passes through the 
mirror and joins Ann, again.<P align=justify> 
As one person, Ann and the young girl struggle to turn the faucet back on and 
lift the toothbrush, but they manage. <P align=justify>
Since then, the world has changed some for Ann. She works as hard as ever and 
tennis is still fun. But her bed. It’s never been warmer.
