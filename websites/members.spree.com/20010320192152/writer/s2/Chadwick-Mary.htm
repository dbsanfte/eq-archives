	<P>Mary Chilton Winslow has the distinction of being the first woman to

step foot on Plymouth Rock as the Pilgrims descended from the

Mayflower after crossing the Atlantic in 1620.</P>

<P>Mary was born sometime around 1608, probably in England. She was 

the daughter of James Chilton and Susanna Furner, who were married

before the year 1587 in England. Not much is known about Mary's

heritage, but it appears that her father was the son of Lionel Chilton

and her mother was likely the daughter of Francis and Isabelle Furner. 

Both parents were "Separatists" or "Pilgrims" which was a religious

group that were dissenters from the Church of England.</P>
<P>
In the early 1600's many of the English began to question the teachings

of the Church of England or Anglican Church. The Church of England

had been founded by Henry VIII when he separated from the Catholic

Church in order to get a divorce from Catherine of Aragon to marry

Anne Bolyen. Some of these individuals chose to remain members of

the Church of England and "purify" it from within and were called

"Puritans". A more radical group believed that the Church of England

was too corrupt to salvaged and these individuals separated from the

church and were nicknamed "Separatists". These Separatists were

persecuted by the English monarchy and even by the Puritans within the

Church of England. Many fled to Holland where their religious views

were tolerated. This same group also soon became known as

"Pilgrims", because they were forced to wander from their native land

looking for religious freedom.</P>

<P>Though it has been widely disputed, it is now believed by most that the

Chilton family was a part of the group of Separatists that fled to

Leyden, Holland. While years ago many believed the Chilton's were

not part of this group, it is recorded that in 1619, Mary and her father,

James Chilton were attacked by a group of rock throwing boys in

Leyden, Holland. Therefore it appears that her parents were indeed

Separatists.</P>

<P>While life in Holland was easier for the Pilgrims than a life of

persecution in England, it was still difficult for the Separatists to make

a living. Most of the group had been farmers in England and upon

moving to Holland they had to learn new skills to survive in an urban

land that afforded them only a meager income. Besides being hard to

eke out a living, the adults of this group felt that their children were

becoming too immersed in the Dutch culture and were slipping away

from their faith.</P>
<P>
Because of this, the Pilgrims decided to leave Holland. The leaders of

the group entered an agreement with a group of "Adventurers" or

business men in England who wanted to profit off those interested in

beginning a new life in the New World. The agreement was made that

in exchange for their passage, the Pilgrims would give the Adventurers

a percentage of their first harvest. Along with the Pilgrims, the

Adventurers also paid the passage of a number of people who were

going to America for financial gain. These people were called

"Strangers" by the Pilgrims. The first group Pilgrims set sail on the

Mayflower in 1620. Mary Chilton and her family were on this ship.

The total number of Pilgrims aboard the Mayflower were 102.

The ship was headed to the Jamestown Colony, Virginia, but missed

it's mark, whether by mistake or planning. The Mayflower arrived at

Cape Cod in November of 1620. James Chilton, who was one of the

oldest of the Mayflower passengers, died on December 18, 1620 while

the Mayflower was docked in Provincetown Harbor. There is no

record as to whether he was buried at land or sea. </P>
<P>
The leaders aboard the Mayflower decided not to stay at Cape Cod and

continued down the coast to Plymouth where the passengers founded a

new colony. According to tradition Mary Chilton raced John Alden to

the front of the launch that was bringing the Mayflower passengers

ashore. She stepped off the boat and was the first woman to set foot

on Plymouth Rock. The painting ,"The Landing of the Pilgrims", by

Henry Bacon, reflects this tradition. It pictures Mary being the first

woman to step out of the launch onto Plymouth Rock.</P>

<P>The first winter that the Pilgrims spent in Plymouth was an extremely

hard one with grave consequences. Nearly half of the passengers that

made it across the Atlantic died in and epidemic referred to as "The

First Sickness", including Mary's mother. This left the

thirteen-year-old Mary an orphan. After the death of her mother, it is

believed that Mary lived for the next few years with the family of Miles

Standish or John Alden.</P>

<P>In 1621, John Winslow, brother of Mayflower passenger Edward

Winslow, came to America on the "Fortune". Mary and John met and

were married sometime before 1627, probably in July of 1623. They

had ten children together:

John, Susanna, Mary Edward, Sarah, Samuel, Joseph, Isaac, an

unnamed child who died young, and Benjamin. The youngest child,

<P>Benjamin, is the only child listed in the Plymouth records.</p>

Sometime after the birth of their last child, the Winslow family moved

to Boston where John became a successful merchant and shipowner. 

It was here that they both died, John in 1674 and Mary in 1679. Mary

was the only female passenger from the Mayflower who left a will.</P>
