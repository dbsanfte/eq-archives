<P>	When was the last time you went for a walk without pain? What prescription 
did you doctor give you to rid you of join pain? Did that prescription 
correct the problem?</P>

<P>Bone and joint problems are the number one problem that causes disability. 
Our chemical laden medical world treats symptoms not problems.</P>
<P>
According to medical experts one in seven people are experiencing joint 
problems. For those over 65 years of age it soars to 80% of people plagued 
with join problems.  There are several reasons for these problems. 
Traumatic overuse or under use of the joints as well as diet, infection, 
immune factors and heredity all play a role here.</P>

<P>Post World War II the pharmaceutical companies began to adulterate and try 
to reproduce the properties that had in the past rebuilt the bones and 
joints but with dismal failure.</P>

<P>Basic science teaches that our body regenerates itself when given the 
proper tools to do so but that has long been forgotten and no longer taught 
in our medical schools. It also teaches that the proper nutrition can 
repair our bodies as well.  If regeneration was still taught by our medical 
schools the pharmaceutical companies could not sell so many chemical laden 
body-destroying drugs, which line their pockets with wealth.</P>
<P>
Our sedentary lifestyles also contribute to the joint problems. The 
stiffness and soreness due to inactivity frequently start as minor 
symptoms, often initiated by bad weather. Before too long the stiffness 
leads to agonizing symptoms which stop any kinds of movements and propels 
you to the doctors office. When right the opposite would be the rule to 
regeneration. Exercise has proven to regenerate the bones and joints but 
our society has been brain washed to think that pain should stop you from 
moving! So get up and move when joint pain hits!</P>

<P>Diet is another factor, especially as we age, more commonly poor eating 
habits are found among people with joint and bone problems. A diet lacking 
in vegetables and omega-3 fats can lead to the production of sticky, watery 
joint fluid that is unable to properly nourish cartilage and other joint 
structures or flush out the toxins that build up. It is important for 
people with joint and bone problems to eat whole foods, including fruits, 
vegetables, grains and nuts and drink plenty of clean, clear chemical-free 
water.</P>

<P>Have you ever known a person taking medications such as the common NSAID's 
to regenerate their bones and completely cure the problem? None, in the 
twenty years I worked in medical offices I only saw a spiral of downhill 
health problems that can only be attributed to the drugs prescribed for 
those problems. On the other hand I have since seen people go off all 
NSAID's and corticosteroids and regain total regeneration of their joints 
and bones. Myself included in that group.</P>

<P>Unfortunately traditional drugs play a major role in the continuing decline 
of the joints and muscles. If you are taking one of these:
Aspirin  Orudis  Ibuprofen  Tandearil  Aleve  Rufen  Bufferin  Datril 
Indocin  Nuprin  Asolid  Liquipen  Nafon  Butazolidin - 
Tylenol  Oxalid  Advil  Tolectin  Excedrin IB  Clinoril  Midol 2000
</P>
<P>Although you may relieve the pain and cover the symptoms you are probably 
accelerating cartilage damage and worsening your condition.  You may also 
be experiencing Headaches, Diarrhea, Constipation, Drowsiness, Sore throat, 
Sensitivity to sunlight, dizziness, ulcers, ringing in the ears, 
nervousness, kidney/urinary problems, swelling of hands/feet, cramps 
nausea, rashes hypertension, stiffness, weight gain and colds. All are 
commonly known side effects from these drugs. Then one of the major side 
effects is death. More than 10,000 people die yearly from the side effects 
of these drugs with hundreds of thousands hospitalized. The JAMA (Journal 
of American Medicine Association) documents this.</P>
<P>
Your body was made to take in food  -- not chemicals. Drugs are unnatural 
to the body and create poisons to deplete the system of nutrients, which 
destroy the body. They may also subdue pain temporarily but these drugs are 
damaging to you.  Clinical tests have shown that arthritis and rheumatism 
are the result of various nutritional deficiencies but when was the last 
time your doctor told you that your diet could make you healthier? In order 
for the body to repair itself it must be fed the building blocks that can 
restore it to the natural state.  Along with proper diet and exercise there 
are much-needed nutrients and herbs that can regenerate and restore joints 
and bones when taken over a period of time. True chemicals tend to give you 
that "right now good feeling" that this generation goes for but in the long 
run is ruining any chance of regeneration.</P>

<P>I wish you all good health and a long life to enjoy it!</P>
