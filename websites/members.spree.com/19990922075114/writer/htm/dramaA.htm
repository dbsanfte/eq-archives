<BR><BR><B>THE JAMES DEAN STORY</B><BR><BR>

Ronald  Martinetti<BR>


44 years after his death, James Dean appears as ever- larger than life.
A cultural icon for 3 decades of American youth, Dean's biggest
Fans, still know little about the REAL James Dean.
Ronald has authored a hard hitting, fact-finding, truthful portrait
of Dean in THE JAMES DEAN STORY.<BR>


Ronald has had access to people who were prominent in Dean's
Life, people who had never agreed to speak openly about the
Star. One of his sources was Dean's biggest support as well as his lover,
Who agreed to talk with Martinetti with the provision that none of the facts
He revealed would be published until after his death.<BR>


Sometimes ugly, sometimes endearing, but always truthful- this portrait of
James Dean is a must read for all Dean fans, and should be required reading material for
the study of cultural trends during the last 40 years.<BR>


You can order this treasure from <a href="http://www.americanlegends.com/index.html">American Legends.</a href>
If you tell them that you read the book review at
A Writer's Choice Literary Journal
They will give you a $5.00 discount off the list price of the book.  Even better still,
Ron has generously agreed to donate $2.00 of that discounts to the National Multiple Sclerosis Foundation.</pre>

Adventures of the Teen Furies <br>
MaryJanice Davidson ©1999       <br>
ISBN 1-58200-072-7<BR>
A very accurate and on target portrayal of the emotional conflict that
 today's teens  face.<BR>
 The characters are well developed, and very believable, so much so, that
 I could mistake several of them for my own nieces!<BR>
 
 Once I started reading it- I couldn't put it down until I was sure the
 young heroines in the work had made the "right" choices and were going
 to be ok. I cared about these characters. Even though they could at
 times be smart-mouthed and rebellious- what teen isn't?<BR>
 
 Ms Davidson writes a cohesive, telling and endearing story of the lives
 of the 6 central characters.<BR>
 And she does so with a special flare and expert craft. Highly
 recommended for young adults and their parents, aunts, grandparents.<BR>
 Well done!<BR>

<BR><BR><font size=2><b><I> FATAL FORTUNE</i>.... Elizabeth Delisi</B><BR>
A romantic suspense novel. Elizabeth has woven a fine mystery with well-developed characters.
A book you'll read cover to cover- without putting it down. Lottie Baldwin has a special "gift"
of knowing, aided by the tarot, tea leaves, and her urgent need to help a friend. You'll find yourself immediately drawn to Lottie
Baldwin, and like Lottie you'll find many ideas flash through your mind as to who the culprit might be. But 
Elizabeth has hidden the villain so well within the fabric of the story- you'll be surprised by  the final outcome.

<B>Detroit Poems - A Collection of Poetry - Doug Tanoury</B><BR>
I am often amazed at the wonderful poetry and literature to be found on the web(outside of A Writer's Choice Literary Journal
,of course!) When Doug told me of his newest collection I visited the site and found it very well done.
I feasted on the delicious offerings that Doug has served up in <I> Detroit Poems</i>. It's a wonderous collection and 
definitely worth the trip to still your hunger for good poetry. You may read the collection on line-

<i><B>Eternal Life…Bobby Right</i></b>
makes an auspicious debut in his first novel. It is neither an archetypically " male" or 
"female" story. It embraces aspects to entertain and draw both sexes. Set in the exotic country of Dubai
it blends both the physical and spiritual aspects of life and death.
                        
An adventure novel that will heighten your awareness of the new wave of spirituality alive in
today's hectic world. The story winds  through loss, rebirth, and most importantly
 leads the reader to a true understanding of love. A wonderful read for fans of
inspirational fiction.
