<BR><BR><FONT FACE="arial narrow" COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1">
                      
<B><P>Procrastination is one of the biggest enemies we have to our
Personal Productivity. Thinking about doing something and
planning to do it are fine, but what if we fail to move
ahead?</P>

<P>Procrastinating the unimportant items in our day is a useful
talent. The problem for many, however, is that we are
procrastinating the important and crucial items in our day,
reducing our personal productivity and increasing our stress
levels.</P>

<P>Here are five pointers to help you to better overcome
procrastination. (You can implement them now or perhaps
tomorrow.or better yet, next week.)</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">1. Daily planning the night before.</FONT> "People don't plan to
fail but they sometimes fail to plan". Without a plan of
action in place before you arrive for work it is real easy
to get caught up in "stuff". The phone rings, someone drops
by and you direct your time responding to the loudest voices
demanding your attention rather than to the most important
priorities on your plate. A plan of action, prepared the
night before is like a roadmap for the next day. You know
what your next step ought to be to get you into productive
action and away from procrastination.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">2. Work with a clean desk.</FONT> "Out of sight, out of mind." The
reverse of that is just as true. When it's in sight, it's in
mind and most of us cannot help but be distracted and our
time is then directed to the less important and easier tasks
causing us to put off the more important tasks. Working with
a clean desk or clean work environment permits us to have
only the most important task before us so that we can focus
all of our attention on that task without other visual
distractions.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">3. Reduce large projects to bite-sized pieces.</FONT> How do you
eat an elephant? One bite at a time. Tomorrow you plan to
work on a three-hour project. The problem is, many of us do
not get three hours to work on any one item. We have to
contend with interruptions, meetings, etc. (I don't know
that I even have an attention span that lasts for three
hours!) And we often wind up procrastinating working on this
task because "there's not enough time to get this done". So,
instead of scheduling the entire three-hour project for
tomorrow, schedule a small bite, a step or two that might
take 20 or 30 minutes. Then put the next step on the next
day's To Do list and the next step after that on that next
day's list, etc. It may take several days, but you will get
that elephant eaten up, one bite at a time.
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">4. Plan around interruptions.</FONT> Interruptions tend to occur in
identifiable patterns. I get most of my interruptions early
in the day versus later in the day. I get most of my
interruptions early in the week versus later in the week.
So, if I plan a big project first thing Monday morning, I'm
creating stress because as soon as I begin, interruptions
arrive and re-focus my attention causing me to procrastinate
what I really wanted to do. It is so much easier swimming
downstream with the current rather than bucking the tide.
Therefore, I plan those larger projects for later in the day
and later in the week when I tend to get fewer
interruptions.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">5. Assign deadlines.</FONT> Have you ever failed to achieve a New
Year's resolution? If so, that probably happened because you
did not set a deadline. Deadlines move us to action. Without
a deadline, things wind up in our "as soon as possible"
pile, a "Never Never Land" where items will get attended to
"someday", "when I get the time". Create a deadline and you
will be moved to action.</P>
