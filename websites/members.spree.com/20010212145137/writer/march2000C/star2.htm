Donny Hero/portrait of the birth of an artist
</CENTER>
<BR><P align=justify>
	Donny arrives at the diner just in time to witness a shocker of a sight right outside the restaurant 

doors.   It appears as if some angry lamb wearing a black cape has decided to protest the establishment.  

Of course that lamb is only the Captain, wearing one of his many zany costumes.  Donny approaches 

laughing hysterically, Insano pops off the mask, exhales a deep gasp of air, and greets his amigo with
	
"Yes…Yes…they said they wouldn't uh…serve a lamb unless he was clean-shaven…Fascits!! Oh 

well this cape's staying on my back."
<P align=justify>
	And with the conclusion of the statement the two decacats head inside to find a nice warm seat, 

have some coffee, and discuss the X's and O's of their mission.  They sit in a dimly lit corner sipping their 

coffee, and jotting down notes for the adventure.  As they swap ideas their excitement grows and grows 

with each new suggestion.
<P align=justify>
	"Yeah uh we definitely should paint the car to express something about our crusade!  Hell we 

should paint ourselves!"
<P align=justify>
"Yeah and we can make 'missing/reward' signs of all our bosses and post them on telephone-poles 

wherever we go, and they can say things like - 'please call this number if you see me and claim the reward 

of- The Essence of Milton Bradley's Spine!'
<P align=justify>
	"Insano, the beast is definitely pissed that we're doing this, you know he's gonna give us a hard 

time out there."
<P align=justify>
	"He already is, I mean just look at those grouchy dudes over there!"
	<P align=justify>

And such is the talk as their mission begins to take form.  It shall be a raucous spontaneous road 

trek, as well as a spiritual/artistic pilgrimage to the Hometown of Donny's greatest American Hero. The 

one who's magic has cast such a spell on young Don; that mad-saint whose wild spirit invincible pulsates 

today as ubiquitously as ever - that heart-beat of America - (the hero - Sal Paradise of course, the 

destination his resting place of Lowell Massachusetts).  The mission, they decide, shall somehow involve 

the forces of Good and Evil, and will ultimately consist of the search for that mysterious something that's 

been calling, that elusive mystery that only they can find.   Donny will take his writings, the captain his 

easel, and they'll be off to be the Wizard, wherever the rainbow might go.  Where they will go before or 

after Sal's Paradise is unknown, but one thing they do know for sure is that this trip is going to be one of 

the best damn experiences of their lives, the world shall be their template, their playground, it's time to 

live, breath, go, go, go, and hopefully, just hopefully the world will smile with them.
<P align=justify>
When Donny gets home he's so full of energy and anticipation that he almost misses a note on the 

table.  When he picks it up and begins to read it a dizziness overcomes him.
<pre>
Dear Donny,

 We had to go out to pick up your brother from Brakers,

 he got into trouble. He's going to be coming back home - 

 he was fired. Hope you're there when we get back because I'm 

worried about him.  We'll tell you what happened later.   
	
There is some supper in the top oven if you're hungry.

Love Mom
</pre><P align=justify>
	Oh no, he did it again, T-bone, crazy-ass T-bone when will you learn.  T-bone and Donny are a 

year apart in age, a galaxy apart in space.  This, the latest of T's stunts or rebellions serving merely as yet 

another episode in his sad saga of rebel without a cause.  It all began back in high school with the class 

disturbances, a few mooning incidents, an occasional skipping of school, but it festered into a hell-bent 

mission unrelenting.   Soon it was the notorious high dive in swimming class clad only in tighty-whities, 

 then it was a pants dropping incident in the cafeteria when he threw himself atop a table full of girls, 

and lets not forget the many harassing incidents of the school's faculty members.  All of this and so much 

more ultimately leading to an eventual expulsion, a minor drug-habit (marijuana), and his current 

depression.  Since high school it seems as if T-bone has not been able to hold a job for any longer than a 

month.  Donny sighs as he looks at a picture of him and T when they were little and says a quick prayer for 

his brother, he throws on one of his favorite Debussy records reclines in the couch, and drifts off for 

awhile.  It isn't long before T-bone arrives, when he does Donny finds out what has happened: 

turns out T-bone unknowingly violated a dress-code, he had stopped into the video-arcade after work to 

play a few rounds of Tekken when a supervisor intercepted him telling him to get his butt on out of there so 

he could change.  T-bone being the rebel he is simply responded with an "after my Fuck'n game!"  This 

of course lead to "Security!" and a brawl that ended up sending the supervisor to the hospital thanks to a 

broken pair of glasses.  
<P align=justify>
	The two star-gazed brothers end up talking half the night away on the porch.  And the evening is 

resolved with the conclusion that T-bone must accompany Don and the Captain on their mission, as if 

everything was just meant to be.

<B><CENTER>Chapter 2 New Days</CENTER></B>


<P align=justify>
	August morning wind and sparrows awake the Dreamer, time to go Donny, a new day is here.  He 

awakes from one of the finest nights of sleep in his life, stretches with cat and begins to gather his goods 

for the trip.  As he and T-bone await the arrival of the Captain, he opens his bag of spells and writes the 

following, feeling quite inspired from all this moments excitement a long time ago:
<BR><pre>
And with the late August crescendo of locust wind I awake

To the beginning of our adventures

Spontaneous road going - time to go get lost 

In this America that I love and loath so much

Off to visit the one who's inspired us so

To dig this inferno of life falling apart

All the sad separate pieces of light-bright constellation
	
once special, now fading out slowly, sometimes unrecognized 
	
But onward we'll ride!  To a road not often traveled
	
Though a road laden with phantom shadows of yesterday.
	
Today we awake in error's den, but today there is a different hue
	
Finally we see the sunrise in the distance
	
As it perches upon shoulders broad
	
That Mount of Joy

</pre>
<P align=justify>
 When stepping outside it's the amber sun of autumn paint rays shimmying off the mount of the 

Dove as it pulls into Donny's driveway.  "The White Dove" that's what it is thinks Donny, as if dispatched 

by some desperate tribesman in one final attempt to find…?  And boy is the Captain ready for the 

occasion - all decked out in one of his finest Magnum P.I. shirts - eye piercing orange so bright and 

flowery!  He seems to be fly'n in hyperspace already, almost as if he's gone on ahead without the 

brothers, mind frantically dream spinn'n webs of creation.  As he bounces out Duke's of Hazard style 

through the windows comes the infamous beast yodel!
<P align=justify>
	"oroughhhhhhhhhhh<BR>hhhhhhghhhhhhhhhhhhhh<BR>hh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(much more hideous then can 

be trancribed!)
<P align=justify>

	

	"So uhh What's goin' on?"
<P align=justify>
	Then chuckling while talking
<P align=justify>
	"Hey Captain, guess who's joining us on our mission?!"
<P align=justify>
	Insano's eyes beem with frantic excitement on over towards the door where T-bone emerges  

duffle bag and all.
<P align=justify>
	Joyously - "OH SHIT!  T-BONES GOING!"
<P align=justify>
	"THAT"S RIGHT MY FRIEND!"  snarls T-bone with a half-smile.
<P align=justify>
	The three vagabonds haste not and begin to saddle up.  After fumbling around with the tapes and 

situating all the supplies it's time to get comfortable with the positions they'll all be occupying for the next 

week or so.  So it's the Captain behind the wheel were he belongs (crazed-creator), Donny sitt'n shady 

shotgun with tape-recorder handy (robust-recorder) and T-bone in the back seat amidst the demented road 

supplies  (passenger-rebel).  The road supplies consist mostly of costumes (like the Lamb mask and 

cape), some cameras and recording equipment, and food supplies which are stashed away in a nice little 

cooler, (food supplies - mostly peanut-butter and bread for All-American PB sandwiches).   With the three 

drifters now snug in their positions it's a look at each other - wild-eyes gleaming with anticipation.  And 

then it's the Captain firing up the engine - VRROOM and on kicks the radio with Bono singing  - 'I want to 

run, I want to hide, I want to tear down the walls that hold me inside', and all for a slight moment feels a bit 

too right.
<P align=justify>
	"AHOY MATIES…LET'S CRUISE!!"
<P align=justify>
	And boom-sha-la they're off!  In the distance a few neighbors trim their cubicle blocks of grass, 

and a dog barks wildly almost as if crying for them to come along and free her from the yoke of her leash.  

The journey must begin with a stop at the Captain's folk's place to drop in and see if his sister Michele can 

join them on the wandererings.  Michele turns out to be at work at the library so it calls for a quick detour.  

On the way to the library the heroes encounter Donny and T's aunt Lorna walking down the street.  They 

stop and pick her up to find out she too is on route to library.  Little old-auntie Lorna seems to catch the 

vibeaciously delicious fever of the grand occasion, joining in on the goof-ball conversations with the wit of 

a New-York hipster

	" Oh I'm so glad you guys are doing this and all, but remember that it's only hard-drugs, no 

alcohol on this trip!"
<P align=justify>
	"Oh yeah of course, of course aunt Lorna, don't worry we're picking up Raule Duke along the 

way."
<P align=justify>
	Laughter, laughter, sweet laughter.
<P align=justify>
	They pull into the library parking lot and dart on in to look for Insano's sis Michele.  It shouldn't 

be a problem finding her, her image strikingly unique - Jet-Black hair, tall, lean, and eyes that burn with 

that mad Insano gleam of possibilities.  The unlikely quartet wander in through the back-door entrance of 

the library, and on through the children's/learning center where a few little Wizards sit exciting over Scary 

Stories to Tell in the Dark, Shel Siverstein  or something of the likes.  As they enter into the main-adult 

section the boys and Aunt Lorna split to their separate paths with a hug and 'good-Luck'.  After she leaves 

a library security guard takes notice of the terrible three, staring ominously at Donny and gang, and 

especially at Donny, who is after all built like the All-American Quarter-back - a primitive male 

threatening six foot-five, young, fit and good-looking too!  And so this guard decides to follow the three 

heroes for awhile, upstairs, back down, into computer lab, and on.   Sherlock Holmes finally decides to give 

up his case when the heroes find Michelle who pushes a shelf full of books to be put back.   Insano 

immediately goofing with sis, forgoing even a greeting for
<P align=justify>
	"Whoa…uh, I think we're gonna need this for the trip!" (picking up a pop-up book entitled 'The 

Magicians road-map for Outer Space').
<P align=justify>
	"Really… go ahead."
<P align=justify>
	"So um what's the verdict?"
<P align=justify>
	"unghh, I don't think its happening, I've still got a few days left here…and I didn't tell ya Darcy's 

coming home tomorrow, so I'd kind of like to hang out with her a little bit.  God…I really wish I could go, 

get a picture of the grave o.k. you're going to Jack's grave right?"
<P align=justify>
	"Yeah, we sure are!"  sighs a hopelessly frantic Donny Queen.  "god, I can't control myself, I'm 

too damn pumped right now.  Wish you could go with us Michelle, you'll be there with us in spirit though, 

that's for sure!"




	

<P align=justify>
That's it, that's it our mission's clear now.  Or so he thinks, does Donny as he files the 

sloppy poetry/prose manuscripts into his giant duffle-bag, he props the bag atop shoulders and strolls over 

to his car. That damn car. Made him a freek'n slave for the past four years..and for what?  Don checks the 

time and to his surprise finds that a whole bunch of it has slipped on by while writing.  He is supposed to 

meet Captain Insano at a great little diner on the end of town.  
<P align=justify>

	So it is time to meet the Captain -'Ladies and Gentlemen this is your Captain Speaking, Oh 

Captain My Captain out to derange the senselessness of the motherbrain! Surf and Rip the Curl and when 

you catch that wave you better Ride that son ova bitch!'  Captain Insano the artist, or one can say art 

student, artist/art student, mad decacat howeling beast yodels at the moon, whatever the description Donny 

knows him as art; a walking talking work in motion. A frazzled frantic creator dreaming out-loud wherever 

he goes.  Donny met the Captain when they worked together at the Wooly Mammoth Grocery store.  They 

both worked in the produce department, and boy oh boy did they ever produce.  When their starving 

heads clashed it was certain chaos for the outside world, work together became "goof-time" - or time to lol 

at all this madness, this crazy old-world.  A few of their routines consisted of the following activities: there 

were the intentionally lame, incoherent announcements of advertisements from within the store such as 

-"That's right the secrets out! Now you know what crazy old uncle Ned puts in that Thanksgiving dish, 

yep, It's Produce Partner's Yam Glaze!" and so on and so forth.  There were also countless times of the 

Capt. waiting for Donny to begin working on the floor, when he did, from within the back-room 

would come the most hideous animalistic noises imaginable.  Sometimes Insano went so far as to parade 

around the store wearing a Watermelon mask antagonizing customers. Another time he even gave birth to 

a life-sized cyclops from a collection of cardboard which he propped up against the produce dept. 

doors, where above he hung a sign reading:  "BEWARE OF THE CYCLOPS".  When consumers came by 

and observed the demented craftsmanship they would of course be left to hear the sounds of some old 

broken-hearted cyclops bemoaning from within!  Any time Don and the Captain got together it 

just felt as if there was hope, the hope of a new day, to see the world for the first-time again, through eyes a 

dreamin, those insano eyes.  And that is what happened when they met, for the first time in his young 

adult life Donny knew exactly what he wanted…to be an artist like Insano, a magician, vates, a mason of 

bricks to paradise.
