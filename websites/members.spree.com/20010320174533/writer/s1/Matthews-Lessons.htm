	<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1">
	<P>For the past fifteen years, I've interviewed several success gurus and
celebrities.  I've met hundreds of people who have expanded their mindset
from why to why not and I've discovered a major truth in why people who can
and should succeed don't - they don't believe they deserve to be there!  Did
you know a lot of people believe they can but they don't believe they
should?  There are people who feel they could succeed but feel they don't
deserve to succeed.</P>

<P>You can't succeed until you feel you should succeed.  Why do people work so
hard to reach a goal only to stop when the achievement of the goal is
clearly in sight?  Why do people back out on solid business deals that could
make them independently wealthy?  Why would we sabotage a positive
relationship with someone who clearly loves us?  Why do we say I should but
I can't?  Powerful questions with a devastating answer which is why we must
develop an understanding of the law of "Have."  You must begin believing
that you already have success and that it is your divine birthright to have
it.  You must be thoroughly convinced that success and achievement is the
natural order of your life and that there should not be any contradiction to
this conviction.</P>

<P><U>THE LESSON OF EXPECTATION</U></P>

<P>Eliminate all doubt that you can't have something, be something or do
something.  You must completely surrender to the law of positive
expectation. Peak Performance Trainer, Brian Tracy in an interview said
this: "The law of expectation says that you get what you expect. Not what
you want, but what you expect. If you expect good things to happen to you,
then good things tend to happen to you. Positive, successful people have an
attitude of positive expectation. They're constantly expecting to do well."
Develop on all mental and spiritual levels that success is your destiny!
</P>
<P>Expectation narrows the gap between what you believe you deserve and desire
and the fulfillment of that belief and desire causing you to attract your
desires like a magnet attracting metal.  Your entire life is solely based on
your expectations.  If your expectations are low, life is a struggle.  If
they are in the medium range, you will enjoy mediocrity, because that zone
can appear comfortable.  But if your expectations are high, inspiration
burns high, enabling you to move above the subtle influence of mediocrity.
</P>
<P>Simply stated, what you expect becomes your reality as well as what you
don't expect becomes your reality too!  In other words, you want to have a
clear and concise assessment of what you want in life, or you may end up
with the opposite of what you want.  The law of expectancy does not accept
an inert mind.  You are always expecting something, whether you are
conscious of it at the moment or not.  What you fear the most is an
expectation.  What you don't feel you deserve becomes an expectation.  So by
all means, consciously expect good things.</P>

<P>An intriguing example that demonstrates the power of expectation and how it
deeply influences the direction of our life comes from a true story of a
coal mining disaster in Germany when a small group of miners were trapped
underground after a massive cave-in.  They realized that the air in the
mineshaft would last for only a limited number of hours.  As it turned out,
just one member of the group was wearing a wristwatch, and he began to
announce the time while the men anxiously awaited rescue.  To sustain hope
in the others, he didn't announce the right time, however; he called out one
hour whenever two hours had passed.  Six days later, a rescue team found the
trapped miners; amazingly, they were all still alive with one exception --
the man who wore the wristwatch died.</P>

<P>The man literally conditioned and expected himself to die after a certain
amount of hours had passed, causing the expectation of his death to become a
self-fulfilling prophecy.   This story represents a prime example of how so
many of us accept a concept or idea, expect it to occur and by default, run
right into it in our future.</P>

<P>To give you another example of how what happens when you expect failure, let
me tell you about a blind date I didn't feel I deserved to be with women who
were attractive.  I was eighteen years old, and looking for lust in all the
wrong places.  For one, I didn't feel I deserved to be around beautiful
women so deep within I expected a lower standard of happiness in my
relationships.</P>

<P>A friend of mine I worked with at the time told me of this young lady she
wanted me to meet.  She told me about the proverbial "beautiful personality"
she had which should have triggered in me that I was being had by my own low
self-expectations.  When I talked to this young lady with the beautiful
personality on the phone, she told me she was drop-dead gorgeous, but she
had been in an accident a week or so earlier.  Ding, ding, ding, ding!  No,
I didn't see this one coming.</P>

<P>I agreed to meet with this drop-dead gorgeous woman with the beautiful
personality for lunch.  I told her she would recognize me from my
clean-shaven head and six feet two inch height.  She told me, I'd recognize
her from her low-crop hairstyle and flowery dress she was wearing.  When I
arrived, there stood a woman who had patches of her hair missing and told me
that she had been in a car accident a week earlier and wore a cast from a
broken ankle and arm.  Surprisingly, she had several teeth missing.  I asked
her if this was a result of the car accident.  She said, "no, I got into a
fight with my sister and fell, knocking out my two front teeth." This also
accounted for her low-cropped hairstyle; her sister had pulled most of it
out during the fight.</P>

<P>So, here I was with this toothless, woman on crutches with less hair in
places than I had.  What I found hilarious is that her nickname was "Lucky
Lucy!" The law of low expectation had its nasty, cynical grips around me and
I could not break free for that entire day.  All I could do was say to
myself, "I told ya so" because it's what I expected even though I could have
done better.  Since I believed I could not get anything better, I programmed
my self-image to go out and attract exactly what I truly expected to have.
</P>
<P>Lesson Learned: Believe in yourself.  Expect the best and realize that you
deserve the best.  You were not put here to live up to low expectations!
