	<P>I thought it would be a good idea to describe the steps I
took to get my first book accepted by one of the worlds
largest publishers of computer books.</P>
<P>
I am not guaranteeing that you will also achieve published
status for your own book by following these steps, but you
will certainly improve your chances!</P>
<P>
MY FIRST FALTERING STEPS</P>

<P>Let me first give you some background. I am a specialist
in computer engineering and I have worked in the computer
industry for over 15 years, the last 6 years I have spent
online with the Internet. I have worked in many different
positions which have exposed me to all sorts of key
business computer technologies and software. Most of my
jobs have also involved writing technical papers and
presentations to give to my peers at computer conferences
around the world.</P>
<P>
Until last year I had not had any of my papers published
other than in the proceedings of the conferences I
presented at. I was also not known as a published author
and I had not written or published any books!</P>

<P>What I am trying to say is that I am very experienced
in computer technology, with a few technical papers under
my belt. This is my starting position in becoming a
published author.</P>

<P>Last year I discovered a gap in the market for a book that
covered a very specific software product called SAP R/3.
For most, if not all of you, this will mean absolutely
nothing to you (unless you also work in the computer
industry). SAP R/3 happens to be a very expensive piece of
business software that thousands of companies around the
world are using in their businesses everyday.</P>

<P>What I discovered was that there are a large number of
books about this software but they all talk about how to
install it and set it up, but none of them talked in any
detail about how to backup the data it handles in case of
a failure! I also felt that with my many years of
experience I should be able to research and write about
this very topic.</P>

<P>So I found an opportunity I felt I could exploit.</P>

<P>The next question was how to go about marketing this
opportunity to a publisher that could sell and distribute
it to a sufficiently large market. I had not considered
self-publishing as I felt that I could not dedicate the
time to it as well as writing.</P>

<P>So what did I do?</P>
<P>
Well....I did the following:-</P>

<P>1. I planned the contents of the book using my knowledge
of the SAP software and by reading other publications
covering similar subjects. At the end of this stage I had a
contents list of what the book would cover.</P>

<P>2. I wrote two example chapters using Microsoft Word v6.0
on my home PC. This took me about two months, working on
the book part-time. I also had a real job to do don't
forget!</P>

<P>3. I then looked for a potential publisher. I did this by
looking at my bookshelf full of computer publications and
made a note of the publishers of these books.</P>

<P>4. I then went to amazon.com and did a search on "SAP" to
find books already in print on this subject and noted the
publishers of those.</P>

<P>5. During this process I discovered that one publisher,
Addison Wesley (who recently bought Simon and Schuster in
the US), kept appearing as a publisher of computer books.
They also appeared on Amazon to be a publisher who were
producing a series of books specifically on SAP. I decided
to target this publisher. Remember at this stage I am an
unpublished, unknown author, with two chapters of a book.</P>

<P>HOW I APPROACHED ADDISON WESLEY</P>
<P>
The first thing I did was to buy a copy of a book on SAP
as published by Addison Wesley. I did this for two reasons.</P>

<P>First I wanted to look at the writing style of the book
and secondly I wanted to look at the style of the page
layout. This was my $40 investment on my project (that's
how much the book cost).</P>

<P>I then went to the two chapters I had written and
formatted them to look like the same style. I also re-wrote
sections to get closer to the writing style without
compromising my own style.</P>

<P>Then I visited Addison Wesley's website and discovered
that they accepted book proposals from their site. So I
submitted a brief outline of what the book would cover
(using the contents list I had previously created), why I
thought the book was necessary (I found a gap in the
market), and an overview of my experience in computing, and
as an author to date (of technical papers).</P>

<P>Amazing....I got a positive response!</P>

<P>The SAME DAY I received an email from Addison Wesley in the
US stating that they had forwarded my idea to the UK
office. After about two weeks I then received an email from
the UK to ask me to fill in a full proposal so that they
could consider it.</P>

<P>My full proposal contained the following sections:-</P>

<P>1. The authors vision of the market</P>

<P>This section contained a description of the target
readership of the proposed book and the anticipated
size of the market</P>

<P>2. The authors vision of the book</P>

<P>Why would someone be interested in this book, which
other books in the market would closely compete, why
is this book different?</P>
<P>
3. The Nuts and Bolts</P>

<P>How long will the manuscript be (in pages and
words), roughly how many illustrations, pictures, diagrams,
when will the manuscript be completed?</P>

<P>4. Supplementing the book</P>

<P>What special offers would be appropriate for the
book, is there any special tie-ins that could be made with
other authors/companies?</P>

<P>5. About the author</P>
<P>
This is the sell section selling YOU!</P>

<P>I detailed here my qualifications and experience
relevant to the book. How I acquired my expertise.
This section is not a full CV, rather it focuses on
aspects of your career that are directly relevant to the
book you are proposing.</P>

<P>6. Additions to the proposal</P>

<P>I included the proposed Table of Contents (a story
outline would be relevant here for a fiction book).
I also included two sample chapters and a summary of
the rest of the book. This gives the publisher a chance
to review your writing.</P>
<P>
To cut a long story short, one month later I had a contract
in my hands together with $4,000 in advance royalties!</P>

<P>I now had to write the rest of the book (or pay back the
royalties!). Of course, I wrote the book.</P>
<P>
SO WHAT DID I DO THAT WORKED?</P>

<P>Basically I did several things that virtually guaranteed my
acceptance.</P>

<P>1. I researched the market in my area of expertise and
identified a gap in the market.</P>

<P>2. I found a publisher already producing books for that
market.</P>

<P>3. I came up with a contents list (after some research of
the subject both on- and offline) and wrote two sample
chapters.</P>

<P>4. I purchased a book published by my target publisher to
look at the writing style and book layout they use.</P>

<P>5. I modified the chapters to suit the writing style and
layout they prefer for the type of book I was writing.</P>

<P>6. I contacted the publisher via their website with my
initial proposal and followed that up with a more detailed
proposal.</P>

<P>7. The rest, as they say, is history!</P>

<P>Maybe I was just lucky, or maybe I hit the publisher at
just the right time! Either way this logical approach
helped my case enormously. If you are considering
approaching a publisher, I suggest following a similar
path. You never know, my experience may just work for
you!</P>
