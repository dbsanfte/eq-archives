 Nightshade<BR>

© Brian Lawrence<BR>



The first chapter of this book is available free on line- and that is all<BR>
you need to read- to know you must read the work in entirety.<BR>
http://www.e-pulp.com/mystery/synopses/night1.html<BR>
It reaches out and grabs you from the beginning because Brian has done<BR>
such a marvelous job breathing life into his characters.<BR>
You will experience the whole gamut of human emotions, recalling them vividly<BR>
from your own life experiences and seeing them again manifest<BR>
on the pages before your eyes.<BR>

The work is so thrilling, written with such zest you'll rush to order <BR>
this e-book after reading the sweet promise of expectation that greets you in<BR>
the beginning chapter. Best of all, you won't be disappointed after reading the<BR>
whole of it. This is a masterfully written work,  which will hopefully put to rest <BR>
some of the myths, and wrongly held ideas about electronic publishing. This book rates<BR>
as well as and better than most, of the new books out in the printed media.<BR>

As a long time fan and supporter of Janet Buck's work, and Janet as person and friend- I was thrilled when she told me she had a chapbook published.
From the opening appetizer- Artichoking Leaves you'll be drawn by Janet's 
commanding presence as she serves up course after course of powerful
poetry, delicious metaphor, righteous anger until sated you finally finish this
Choice offering, and savor the blood rust flavor left on your tongue.
Janet's work is not for the reader seeking flowery sonnets and grandiose
gestures of love. It is instead for the deeply human, feeling, and deserted parts of ourselves that suffer through personal atrocities, be they emotional, medical, or both.

A strong, powerful work- highly recommended. And best of all- it is free
for the feeding, nourishing your soul, and cleansing your palette
on the marvelous sorbet of Janet's angst prepared with her usual
blend of  eloquence, articulation, and vivid aroma of life's underbelly.

For a first novel, this is an extraordinary work. Although perhaps a little more editing would have pared down the few "first novel" mistakes which lie mainly in technique and point of view- this is still an extremely strong work.

It manages to bring poetry and art into the writing, which is not seen often enough, in today's literary offerings. It does this extremely well, highlighting the tensions in a strange family sovereignty bordering on clannish. These tensions run the width of experience from sexual unease, religious questioning, issues of faith and betrayal plus much more.

I'm a fan of hyperbole, metaphor, and poetic license in fiction. Probably because I myself am a poet more than anything else. And in this work it serves well.  It leaves you pondering the deep questions of the aforementioned tensions. An excellent offering for reading groups, rhetoric classes, and the like.

It is set mainly in a desolate cliquish area of Wyoming which lends to the
surreal nature of the novel. The haunting images that remain with you throughout
the read are well woven into the fabric of the book in its beginning chapter. The work is a bit esoteric which adds to it's charm and is probably why the larger publishing houses would term this book "not commercial enough" for their titles.
However, it is a priceless beginning effort from an author that shows worlds of
talent and potential.
