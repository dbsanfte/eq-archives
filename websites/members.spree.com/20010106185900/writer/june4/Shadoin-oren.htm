<FONT FACE="Courier New" COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1"><b>
<P>The folks in Rock Creek proper and the surrounding communities have
little use for politicians. This makes them a lot like most folks
in
this respect. Oren Oglesby isn't from Rock Creek, or anywhere near
Rock
Creek, but he got himself elected to the US Senate and that pretty
much
qualified him, in his own august opinion, to know the business of
Rock
Creek better than the citizens themselves.</P>

<P>Rock Creek is a sleepy little town.  Although it's the county seat
and a
good place to raise kids and get tractor parts, it doesn't really
rate
as a metropolis. It hardly registers even as a small town, though
it is
a small town through-and-through.  After all, the mayor and the
fire
chief sleep together, being husband and wife and all. Everyone
pulls
together, except during the Ecumenical Picnic the Sunday before
Easter
when the Catholics and Methodists pull against each other in the
All-Church's Tug-of-war. Folks in Rock Creek mind their elders and
their
manners, help without being asked, attend church and children's
pageants
and try to live as good neighbors.</P>

<P>The town is run by a Mayor and City Council, which is always the
same
five folks who take turns running for mayor.  They handle the
paperwork
that goes along with being a twentieth century small town, but the
community is run by a group known collectively as the Locals.  The
Locals are a loosely organized cross-section of the entire town.
They
are farmers and teachers, truckers and welders, doctors and
businessmen.  The Locals meet every morning at Daisy's Highway 66
Cafe
over biscuits and gravy and every afternoon across the highway in
Clem's
Feed Store to share sips from the bottle under Clem's counter.  The
usual topics of discussion are fly-fishing, high school sports,
trout
fishing, understanding women (discussed in short bursts only),
fishing
Rock Creek, and Daisy's biscuits and gravy.</P>

<P>John the Liar might be the de facto leader of the Locals.  He's a
retired farmer who loves to fish more than farm and loves his
family
nearly as much.  Until the Perfesser walked in one summer day, John
the
Liar was most apt to be cause behind the mischief.  Clem Warden,
who own
the Feed Store (and lumber yard) is the man who tends to say the
least
and wield the most influence.  The Perfesser, who teaches history
at the
small private college up the road, is the biggest trouble maker of
the
group.  The Perfesser often is the mastermind when shenanigans are
played, but is never caught if the plan goes awry.  Rockhead, Big
Mike,
Okie Bob, JoeHoehn, Spud James, Bug June, Geezer Hoak and the rest
of
the Locals are good guys to have on your side when trouble starts.
Nobody wants to be on the opposite side of Big Mike when trouble
starts.</P>
<P>
When Senator Oren Oglesby decided, without consulting the locals or
the
Locals, that a dam on the Flat River would help control the
flooding
down near the state capitol, it wasn't until Clem and John the Liar
read
it in the Capitol City News that any hackles at all were raised in
Rock
Creek.  The proposed dam site would be a little less than a mile
down
stream from the confluence of the Rock Creek and Flat River, which
meant
there would only be about fifteen feet of variance between the dam
site
and the creek's mouth. A thirty-five foot dam and dike system would
mean
that the lower two and a half miles of the Rock Creek would be
back-flooded during heavy rains, effectively silting-in the rapids
and
ruining the trout fishing from the Lundquist place south, some of
the
finest fishing in the state.</P>

<P>Of course this brought a high level of anxiety to Clem's Feed
Store. The
Locals gathered to talk strategy and discuss dynamiting the dam and
other violent acts requiring the involvement of a certain Senator,
though probably not as a willing participant. Whiskey and
indignation
will do that to a man. The Perfesser arrived in due course and
being far
less intoxicated than the Locals, suggested an alternative course
of
action.  Instead of shooting him,  he suggested they invite the
Distinguished Gentleman to breakfast.</P>

<P>It didn't seem like such a great plan to the Locals, who voiced
their
opinions to the contrary.  But they deferred to the intelligence
and
cunning of the Perfesser, who has always managed to be successful
in
matters of intelligence and cunning.  What the Perfesser knows and
that
the Locals do not, is that Senators love free food and any chance
to
meet the people and be the center of attention.  They behave as the
benevolent lord who loves to wade amongst his serfs, basking in his
own
splendor.</P>

<P>The Distinguished Gentleman regarded the Perfesser's earnest
invitation
as an opportunity to accept the accolades of his people for his
great
leadership and keen intelligence. So it was with great flourish
that
Senator Oglesby agreed to attend a breakfast held in his honor at
Daisy's Hwy. 66 Cafe, the following Tuesday.</P>

<P>On that very next Tuesday, all of the Locals were crowded around
their
usual tables, soaking up Daisy's finest gravy with her freshly
baked
buttermilk biscuits and downing huge quantities of strong black
fisherman's coffee. Senator Oglesby rolls in, fashionably late,
with a
pretty young aide-de-camp and a serious looking State
Trooper/bodyguard/driver. He works the fringes of the room with a
practiced smile and an easy grace, moving from table to table,
shaking
hands and touching shoulders.  He is in his element and his is
alive
with the energy of his constituency.</P>

<P>Some of Daisy's regulars have no idea who this fellow is, but
recognize
his face somewhat. They are in Daisy's only because she makes the
finest
biscuits and gravy for five hundred miles in any direction.  The
aide
follows the senator with buttons and bumper stickers. His campaign
for
reelection, though not officially announced, seems to already be in
full
swing.</P>

<P>The Perfesser rises to greet the Senator and introduce him around
to the
Locals. Daisy, being briefed on the Senator's dietary requirements,
brings out fresh-baked bran muffins, orange juice laced with
Metamucil,
and a bowl of freshly cut fruit. Incidentally, these items will
make a
permanent appearance on her menu after the elder Locals decide that
though the biscuits and gravy are superb, those fresh-baked bran
muffins
might be just the ticket for their own dietary fiber needs.</P>

<P>Oren Oglesby makes himself right at home, calling everyone by first
name, as if he has known them forever. As any good politician is
good at
recalling names, this Distinguished Gentleman excels. Pretty soon
what
had been a reluctant mob has become a family affair. The Locals are
calling the Senator "Oren" and each is regaling the other with
stories
and family histories. The Distinguished Gentleman listens
attentively
and asks insightful questions or offers sincere comments in
commiseration. As breakfast settles, the Perfesser asks the Senator
if
he has ever fly-fished.</P>

<P>"Why no, I have never had the opportunity present itself."</P>

<P>"Would you like to give it a go sometime?"</P>

<P>"Of course, that sounds splendid."</P>

<P>"How about now?"</P>

<P>The Senator consults his aide, who consults her leather organizer
and
nods in the affirmative. The Senator has all of the morning open
before
he must leave for a party fund raiser at the state capitol. The
Distinguished Gentleman has enjoyed the hospitality of Rock Creek
immensely and is in no hurry to cut short his stay.  Thus
encouraged,
the Perfesser ushers the Senator out to his waiting convertible and
within minutes the Senator and the Perfesser are fully dressed in
similar outfits and making false casts in the gravel parking lot
across
the highway at the feed store. The Perfesser is a good teacher and
the
Senator is an apt pupil. They fold themselves into the Perfesser's
little foreign sports car and roar off down the county road, to a
special place on the Rock Creek. The State Trooper and Aide-de-camp
are
following in the Senator's Lincoln Towncar, and the Locals form a
caravan of pickup trucks behind.</P>

<P>The Perfesser pulls into a field of wild flowers, bursting in reds,
yellows, lilacs, and blues. Butterflies rise in waves as they make
their
way down to the Rock Creek. The Senator is taken aback by the
beauty.
They reach a section of the Rock Creek simply called the Long
Stretch by
the Locals. It is simply a long stretch of rapids punctuated by
small
pools and surrounded by great natural beauty. The Locals tend to
eschew
the area because the pools, though full of trout, fail to yield any
trout of remarkable quality.</P>

<P>Within minutes of the first cast, it is apparent to the Locals that
the Senator is well out of his element. He struggles to get the
presentation right, often snagging his back-cast, misses his targets, and ties
legendary wind knots. But he doesn't quit. Oren Oglesby, who in his
own mind must get this right in order to win the hearts of his
constituents,
gets better. By noon, his casts are
not yet expert, but they are accurate. He ties on his new leaders
with aplomb. He catches a nice limit of fair-sized trout, not knowing
that they are the finest this stretch has to offer. Oglesby even gets
his pretty young aide to try her hand, managing to pass on enough of
his own newly-gained knowledge to get a trout to rise to her presentation.
She is all grin.</P>
<P>The entourage retires to Daisy's for a hot beef sandwich luncheon.
The
Distinguished Gentleman abandons his regular diet to down three
heaping
servings of finely shredded roast beef and thick brown gravy. His
eyelids lower to half-staff. The early morning travel, the hard
fishing,
and the big lunch have put him in a mellow and sleepy mood. The
Perfesser senses that the time is right.</P>

<P>"You have certainly caught on to fly fishing Senator."</P>

<P>"Thank you. I had a wonderfully patient teacher."</P>

<P>"Tonight the bite will be better up by the Trestle Pool...."</P>

<P>"I am afraid I am going to miss it. I have a fund-raiser at the
state
capitol I must attend."</P>

<P>"We hope you will come back soon, and fish with us again."</P>

<P>"I would like to do that very thing, but I am afraid it won't be
soon."</P>
<P>
"That's too bad, Senator. If you wait too long you won't get
another
chance. It seems that there is a dam proposed to block the Flat
River
just a couple of miles from that very stretch we were on today. It
will
ruin all the trout fishing along that section of Rock Creek."</P>

<P>"My dear Professor, what ever gave you an idea like that? It would
border on the criminal to destroy such a beautiful stretch of
nature. It
will NEVER happen while I am in office."</P>

<P>"I had no idea you were such a naturalist, Oren."</P>

<P>"Dear friend, I never even knew I was a fly-fisherman."</P>
<P>
The pair's shared laughter sent a ripple of approval through the
Locals.
Clem chuckled and shook his head and smiled. He rose and paid his
bill,
and the Senator's and the Perfesser's. It was a small price to pay
to
keep his beloved Rock Creek untouched. Later he would reward the
Perfesser properly, as would all of the Locals, when they gathered
over
at Clem's Feed Store for whiskey and attaboys.</P>

<P>When the hubbub died down from the Perfesser's triumphant entrance
to
his feed store, Clem asked the Perfesser how he had come upon his
plan.</P>
<P>
"It was quite simple really. Oren Oglesby is a city boy,
born-and-raised. A little taste of the outdoors is usually all it
takes
to get them hooked. I could tell by his eyes when I was helping him
into
his waders that this was far more fun for him than anything else he
has
done lately. The wild flowers and the fishing were just the
clincher. He
will consider the Long Stretch to be his home stretch for the rest
of
his days. You can be he'll be back through here to fish again."</P>

<P>"What if you were wrong and your plan didn't work?"</P>

<P>"My friend, then the Senator might have slipped on a rock and
probably
drowned when his waders filled with water and he couldn't get out
of
them."</P>

<P>Clem thought on the implications of that statement. He was sure
that the
Perfesser was pulling his leg. Maybe.
