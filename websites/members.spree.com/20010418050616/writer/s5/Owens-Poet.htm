	Ryan K. Travis, or RAT as some affectionately call him, is a master of the ridiculous, a tyrant over the kingdom of inanity, and a slave to poetic passion.  Finding his penchant for poetry in his early teens, Travis has suddenly become a recognizable author, especially on the Internet's e-zines.  In 1997, Travis started his stint as a poetry performance guru with Stone Soup Poetry, located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  He has since moved from behind the mike to behind the scenes as a co-editor of <U>The Umbrella</U>, an online magazine dedicated to "the arts" (namely poetry).  Still, Travis pays homage to his early days as a performer by appearing often at open microphone calls around the Cambridge area.  Travis is also a member of the group Short Attention Expanding Poets (SAEP, founded by D.A. Boucher and an individual called CAT, and inspired by a TV show on cable's Comedy Central) which, in Travis' words, "[continues] to expand the limits of poetry and the word…utilizing Haiku, sonnets and free form poetry as well as combining styles to create new forms and [break] down the barriers of language itself" (Travis) .  Perhaps his most notable achievement, though, is his membership in the improv comedy troupe FUBIS.  It is no surprise, then, that humor is important to Travis' poetry; says Travis, "I have a lot of funny pieces…I've always been kinda funny so the comedy stint was a natural progression [to poetry]." 
</P>
	<P>	Among his major poetic influences, Travis cites Charles Bukowski and Henry Rollins, who inspire him to "write better or push limits."  However, Travis' mind-blowing themes are entirely his own, for, as he states, "I'm influenced by life around me.  Right from the beginning I was always a socially conscientious writer… ."  Poetry is not Travis' only means of expression, however; in addition, he writes songs and fiction.  In fact, a popular Sunday night "Poetry Jam" was a place of realization for Travis' singing abilities.   Singer or not, Travis still holds his written work dear: of his poems, "Thinner" is his particular favorite.  Pertaining to his collected poems Travis says unabashedly, "I love to shock people."  Shocking or not, this author's compulsion to write began very early in life, when he "got into writing songs for a punk band and then a busted death metal band" and eventually converted these pieces into poems.  Travis even writes in a ground-breaking poetic form called "sonnetanku," created by D.A. Boucher, Travis' friend and mentor.  Thanks to Boucher's new style, the literary world may never be the same, especially in the hands of a poet like Travis.  Says Travis, "I asked [Boucher] the form for haiku and…tanka and then the natural progression to sonnetanku…it was like one of those bad teen anti-drug films, I was hooked."     </P>
	<P>
	Like many poets, Travis writes both for himself and the rest of humanity: "Sometimes I write for the world, I see an injustice and I speak out about it.  Other times I write for friends or family.  I write from the heart." Clearly, such sincere passion has led Travis to moderate literary success; he has been published in various media and is a popular local reader.  However, this contemporary author's sometimes risqué work has been known to grant the public a distorted view of his varying styles.  On this note, Travis reveals that he has "this notorious reputation in the New England area," but "when people finally meet [him] and hear [his] serious work…they are surprised to find out [he] can be tender and play a children's show as well."  Thus, Travis is a flexible artist who appropriately adapts to his intended audience.  Such elasticity will go far in helping Travis achieve his literary goals, which, other than to "make lots and lots of money," he says are "to push the word and break the stigma that some words have.  To revitalize the language itself and destroy the boundaries of poetry and the word."  There is a price for such cutting-edge attitudes, though.  As Travis laments, "Our group has been stigmatized in [the local scene] as an outrageous, rowdy group with no morals… ." 
</P>
<P>	Surprisingly, such negative criticism is only a minor irritation compared to some of the other obstacles littering Travis' path to publication and (at least) local stardom.  According to him, "Cambridge, MA is a very snooty scene.  You're either an academic writer or a slam poet and very few allow the writer to expand… ."  However, as a member of the previously mentioned group SAEP, Travis says that both he and they are "all about expanding the word and expanding your mind."  Consistent with these goals, then, Travis advises other aspiring poets to "write and keep it short, the shorter the better and write from the heart.  Don't be afraid to use a word because it's one of 'those words'," (i.e. a curse word).  Finally, Travis adds that "if you write you should share your work, be it on the stage or with your friends or even published word.  A poem should never sit in a notebook."                          </P>	
	<P>
	Ryan Travis' poetry is unlike much today's contemporary works.  To begin, his style is totally unique in its unpredictability.  From the mundane to the extraordinarily profound, Travis' words strike readers at the core of their sensibilities, often incorporating the two with exquisite precision and tremendous results.  For instance, in "Blood Money," Travis first distracts readers with his detailed description of preparing fish at his job:  
<pre>
I take a piece of fish, schrod 
place it in the batter and into the bread-crumbs 
cover it, pat it, flip it, cover it, pat it 
and place it in the basket 
and drop the basket into the hot oil (Travis 11-15) 
</pre>
However, while almost annoying with this seemingly mindless ramble, Travis suddenly blasts readers with an unexpected, disjunctive observation: "My boss comes in and says / 'I never do anything immoral' " (16-17).  What?  A mere moment ago, the poem read like fast food instructions for preparing a fish filet; suddenly, an intense confession from the boss takes its place, providing a deep contrast between apathetic, monotonous living and frantic and chaotic civilization.  Thus, Travis' work is anything but boring.  Poems such as "Blood Money" prove his creative power to jolt readers into realizing that a moment of profundity (often cynical) can occur at any time, even while frying fish.
</P>
	<P>
	Charmingly, Travis pushes the envelope of the English language, challenging many conventions of  "good" poetry and creating his own instead.  Thus, rather than conform, Travis creates his own figurative literary society. "Melissa's Eyes" is an appropriate example, for the poem seems more like a road trip game than an actual piece of literature. Each line begins with the letter of the alphabet that is consecutive to the letter on the preceding line, thus creating a poem whose word choices are governed largely by alphabetical order.  While the basic form for the poem was introduced one night several years ago by a man called simply Magi (Mah-Ghee) at T.T. the Bear's Place (in Massachusetts), Travis took the form a step further by adding a second word to each line, thus creating an addictive alliteration.  The following portion of "Melissa's Eyes"  serves as an adequate example of the form: 
<pre>
Alluring Azure
Baby Blue
Captivatingly Calculating
Dreamily Dangerous
Enticingly Evil (1-5)
</pre>
</P>
<P>  As stated, the alliteration (for instance, dreamily and dangerous both begin with the letter d), championed by Travis, adds to the poem's memorability.  This pattern continues until the very end, when the narrator makes a rather comic remark in the line for z:  "Zircons Zonk me out."  Thus, much like "Blood Money," an element of surprise occurs in the midst of predictable, almost mundane circumstances.  This monkey wrench works to create an incredibly engaging poem; when the reader finishes, he or she absolutely must go back to the beginning and read the piece again. Clearly, Ryan Travis takes a poetic template and gives birth to a compelling piece on a woman's eyes, one that is at once delightful to read and haunting.   </P>
<P>As with the two great poets E.E. Cummings and Ezra Pound, a subtle yet undeniable sense of humor permeates Travis' poems.  His Haiku reflecting his vegetarian values and contempt for animal abuse is strangely funny.  Entitled "Not Chicken again?", this tiny piece communicates its message without burdening readers with wordiness or unnecessarily violent images:
<pre>
on McCollem's farm 
pets of every size and shape
cooked to perfection
</pre>
 is the poem in its entirety.  Thus, while the death of livestock is clearly portrayed as a negative element, the juxtaposition of the second and third lines (the idea that the animals are "pets" combined with the positive image of  "cooked to perfection") provides a highly effective commentary on animal rights: human loyalty to its perceived possessions, animals, only lasts until someone's stomach growls.  
</P>	
	<P>
	Another example of Travis' use of humor to explore intimate and often horrifying subjects is manifest in "slowest suicide," a poem about two friends who compete to successfully commit suicide before the other.  While the topic of self-inflicted demise is, of course, intense reading, Travis brings to it his priceless brand of humor by making the means of suicide ridiculous.  For instance, one's mode of death is to "heat up Diet Pepsi" and "[drink] it right down" (5 and 9, respectively).  However, the ultimate "joke" occurs at the poem's end, when "Walking down the street / arguing back n'forth they, / [are] hit by a bus" (11-13).  There is more at work in these words than just slapstick, though. By being presented in a comic light, suicide is somehow demeaned; rather than seeming like an honorable way out and a courageous thing to do, Travis' humor makes it look ridiculous.  In other words, Travis seems to say, "Why bother killing yourself when you're going to die anyway, and probably by embarrassing means?"  Thus, the reader's journey through the poem is accompanied by hope about an otherwise hopeless subject; if suicide can be made a joke of, why should anyone who is sad enough to die want to invoke laughter instead?  The poem invokes the image of two teenagers acting silly to impress one another, perhaps even to prove something, and then who both end up looking like fools. 
	</P>
<P>

Perhaps Travis' most admirable piece is "Snails," a poetic description of the death of the title creatures.  While this topic does not seem particularly interesting or important at first glance, the blatant sadness of its ending, produced by the effect of a carefully placed ellipsis, makes the piece well worth reading.  Like the animal-title poems of Marianne Moore and Elizabeth Bishop, "Snails" also has a definite visual power.  In addition, the poem contains an interesting rhyme scheme, recording the narrator's experience of passing dead snails on the sidewalk.  However silly the topic may seem, this technique, combined with a carefully-placed ellipsis, elicits sympathy from an otherwise apathetic reader in the last three lines:
<pre>
in the morning as I walked by
and I said… 
that's how snails die.
</pre>
  So, after a brutal description of snail carcasses, which contains phrases such as "the corpse is being picked away" (5) and "see them squished up, green-black smear" (3), the poem's end forces readers to realize that even the death of an insignificant snail is worth lamenting.  Travis extends this attitude even further by personifying snails with the word corpse, usually reserved for cadavers.  This child-like sensitivity is yet another endearing quality of Travis' poetry, and, as stated, the rhyme scheme of "Snails" only reinforces this image of childish innocence. A final matter of importance is that the poem is written in couplets, although some lines are not marked by punctuation and, at first glance, seem to be endjambed.   Nevertheless, the rhyme scheme, whose easy comprehension is aided by short lines with syllabically simple words, lends a sing-song quality to the poem.  Clearly, while Travis' work is one of odd topics and even odder tone, it is exactly these characteristics that make his poetry so memorable.  
</P>
<P>
	Travis' creations are comparable to the work of American poets such as Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman in their intensive yet nature-loving style, but he is also quite original.  On one hand, an almost Dickinsonian tone is present in much of Travis' work, for he comments often on intensive experiences, usually zeroing in on a particular image or sensation.  In "Shattered peace/piece," Travis writes, "helicopter sound / chopping through the air, disturbs / peaceful zen moment" (4-6).  However, ever-consistent in his inconsistent style, in the very same poem, Travis includes Whitmanian elements of a nature-loving ecstasy: "sun against my back / birds twitter and chirp away" (7-8).  Further, Travis' poetry sometimes has a cynical tone, much like the work of Sharon Olds.  For example, as stated earlier, "Blood Money" is a rather cynical look at everyday life.  The last line rhetorically laments, "Why do I work here again?"  In comparison, Olds' piece "Things That Are Worse Than Death" also takes a harsh look at life in these times:  "You tell how the guards tortured the woman, the man, the child, / in front of each other…I can see myself…slitting my own throat" (Olds 1080, lines 4-5, 8 and 10).  Clearly, even though Travis' cynicism is nothing new, his version of expressing his disgust for modern living is more subtle, as he communicates his views through rhetorical questions rather than through graphic examples, as used by Olds.  Thus, while Travis' poems sometimes share characteristics of the work of others (usually forbearing poets), he is an author of varying style and theme, approaching topics in a new fashion or devising a new element to include as a poetic form.    
</P>	
	<P>Typically, a careful reader of poetry will try to categorize it.  However, the poetry of Ryan Travis defies such an approach.  While surely all poets are influenced by other writers and are thus categorically compatible with those authors, Travis is an anomaly of a poet.  In other words, his poetry shares some similarities with hundreds of other pieces, but Travis also explores cutting-edge poetic forms and examines old themes in a refreshing new light.  Perhaps, then, Ryan Travis writes as a self-aware poet, one who strives to obtain a new and comfortable style without boxing himself in to a particular genre designed by previous writers or limiting himself to a particular poetic form, such as ballads or sonnets.  If this is indeed the case, Travis should be rewarded for his courage to turn up the volume a notch and force readers to deal with a uniquely challenging poetry, both puzzling and provocative in its innovative techniques.  After all, if poetry is art, and art should be challenging, what is art if not the poetry of Ryan Travis?       </P>
