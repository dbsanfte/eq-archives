	<P>It was a brilliant, smogless, October day, the kind when the sun
                       makes shadows razor-sharp. Green balls hung from sycamore
                       stems. After Christmas they would turn brown and fall. If you
                       stepped on them with bare feet they could really hurt your arch. I
                       made my way to Daryl's. In his open garage his dad stood in a
                       denim apron with pens and screwdrivers in his pockets, wearing
                       safety goggles. I couldn't see what he held in his hand. Daryl
                       wasn't around so I rang the bell. Mrs. Flynn answered the door
                       with a baby on her hip. She wore a short-sleeved floral dress
                       buttoned to the collar. "Is Daryl home?" I said. </P>
	<P>"Sure, come right in," she said. "Let's see-your name is.....?</P>
	<P>"Eric." </P>
	"<P>That's right-Eric." She laughed. "You know where Daryl's room is,
                       don't you?" 
</P>
                       <P>"Mmm-hmm." I went down the narrow hallway and knocked on his
                       door.</P> 

                       <P>"Who is it?" Daryl said. </P>

                   <P>    "Eric." </P>

                 <P>      "Come in.". Daryl was scrunched up in the corner where his twin
                       bed met the walls, reading a thick book. He looked up from the
                       book as if it required more effort than his neck wanted to make.
                       "So what's up?" he said.</P>

                       <P>"Nothing," I said. "What's that you're reading?" 
</P>
                      <P> "Swiss Family Robinson," he said.</P> 

                      <P> "What's that about?"</P> 

                     <P>  "These people get shipwrecked on an island and they have to make
                       stuff out of whatever they find there and then some pirates come
                       and it's pretty scary." </P>

                       <P>"Neat," I said.</P> 

                       <P>"Yeah, they make useful things like water pipes out of bamboo and
                       rope out of plants and cups from coconuts." 
</P>
                     <P>  "So what's your dad making now?"</P> 

                  <P>     "Heck if I know," Daryl said. "He never lets me see anything until
                       he's done with it." </P>

                      <P> "Then you get to play with it?" </P>

                      <P> "Mmm-hmm." </P>

                   <P>    "Do you ever need any help?" </P>

                  <P>     "Sure," he said. "Usually I just round up the neighbor kids but you
                       could come over if you want." </P>

                     <P>  "When do you think that will be?" </P>

                    <P>   "You never know," he said.</P>



                     <P>  "Martha, Martha! You gotta see this!" His dad's voice boomed
                       down the hall.</P> 

                    <P>   "Honey I'm trying to get the baby asleep!" she said. Do be quieter,
                       won't you?"</P> 

                       <P>We ran to the kitchen. (I mean I ran-- Daryl kind of moseyed.) 
</P>
                     <P>  "But look!" his dad continued, oblivious to the warning. He held out
                       two tapered sticks, one red and one blue, and two yellow rings the
                       circumference of a dinner plate. "See?" </P>

                     <P>  "Yes, dear," Mrs. Flynn said. "So---?" </P>

                    <P>   "Don't you see? Each kid has a stick. The ring hangs on it like this.
                       Then they sling the rings back and forth and catch them with the
                       sticks. Watch." He slung a yellow ring across the living room. It
                       barely missed a lampshade then wobbled on the carpet like a
                       dropped quarter. </P>

                      <P> "Honey!" Mrs. Flynn hissed.</P> 

                       <P>"Sorry, sorry. Heh boys, you want to try this out?" 
</P>
                      <P> "Sure!" we said. We followed him out to the front lawn. I noticed
                       the lawn needed mowing. 
</P>
                      <P> "Now you-what's your name?" </P>

                       <P>"Eric." </P>

                   <P>    "Eric, I want you to put the ring on the stick and then sling it to
                       Daryl."</P> 

                       <P>"OK." I hung the ring on the stick and it slid down to the edge of
                       my fist, then cranked my arm back and let fly. The ring sailed
                       straight up in the air and dropped at my feet.
</P>
                       <P>"Catch it!" Mr. Flynn yelled as it dropped but I didn't react in time.
                       "Here, let me show you," he said. With a fluid sidearm motion he
                       tossed the ring directly at his son, who jumped out of the way. "No,
                       Daryl, you're supposed to catch it!" he said. 
</P>
                      <P> "Sorry. Dad, I wasn't ready." Daryl picked up the ring and put it on
                       his own stick. He raised his arm behind his head and flung it. It
                       flew down on a straight line and landed between us. I ran over to
                       get it and put it on my stick. This time I imitated the sidearm motion
                       of Mr. Flynn. To no avail. The ring flipped out into the street and
                       skidded across to the curb. I grinned at Mr. Flynn, embarrassed.
                       "Keep trying, boys. You'll get it," he said. 
</P>
                       <P>After half an hour I caught a ring. It hurt the top of my fist as it slid
                       down the stick. Daryl still hadn't caught one. 
</P>
                      <P> "That's it, that's it, good job boys," said Mr. Flynn. "I'm sure you'll
                       get better with practice. I need my prototype back, though. It
                       should come off the line in a couple of weeks." 
</P>
                    <P>   Daryl delivered a square, flat box to my house two weeks later. It
                       was the size of a big pizza box. On the top it read "Loop-D-Loop."
                       Below was a picture of two kids in striped T-shirts throwing the
                       ring back and forth, having the time of their lives. The caption said,
                       "It's just like playing horseshoes on the run." Chad and I took it out
                       to play. After an hour Chad caught a ring. "Ow!" he said when it
                       slid down to his fist. We quit. 
</P>
                    <P>   I wanted very much to like Mr. Flynn’s invention. I tried to like it
                       the same way I tried to like a comic book when I spent my own
                       money on it. But in the end I sometimes had to admit to myself I'd
                       bought a dud, though it wasn't easy.</P> 

                     <P>  A couple weeks later I saw a commercial on a Saturday morning
                       cartoon advertising the "Loop-D-Loop." The kids in the ad made it
                       look easy. In my experience it was hard. Even if I was good at it,
                       what's the point of playing catch with a ring? A baseball was much
                       more fun to throw because it was shaped to fit your hand. Mr.
                       Flynn had substituted sticks for arms and rings for balls. All he did
                       was make it harder to play catch. </P>

                 <P>      The TV ads didn't last long. The next time I went to Daryl's I
                       noticed a stack of Loop-D-Loop boxes in the garage. I wondered
                       how many toy stores carried them. I never saw anyone play with
                       them except the kids who got them free from Daryl and they (like
                       me) weren't too excited. This didn't discourage Mr. Flynn for a
                       moment. As soon as he saw me and Daryl coming out of the house
                       that day he said, "Look, Daryl, and--- Rick is it? A new toy." He
                       proudly displayed a plastic propeller with a clamp. He screwed it
                       onto Daryl's handlebars. "Now take a ride," he said, beaming. Daryl
                       hopped on and began to pedal. As he did the propeller turned faster
                       and faster until it made a noise like the one a playing card makes
                       when you clip it to your back wheel. But the sound wasn't as
                       satisfying, more of a click than a flap. Daryl returned from the
                       tryout. </P>

                       <P>"This is neat, Dad. I think kids will like this," he said. 
</P>
                    <P>   "Me, too, Mr. Flynn," I said. </P>

                       <P>This time the commercials lasted longer and all the kids in our
                       neighborhood had a propeller on their bikes until the plastic broke.
                       Some of them even bought it. </P>
