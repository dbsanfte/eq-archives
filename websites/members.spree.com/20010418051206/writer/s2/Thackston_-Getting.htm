	<P>There is a nasty rumor that press releases don't work.  Not
true!  Press releases can be a fabulous tool for business
promotion... IF they are properly written and presented.  A
problem occurs because most people are not aware of the
special requirements of press releases.</P>

<P>A press release is not a page-long advertisement.  A press
release is not a novel.  A press release is not a tell-all
promotional piece that is full of detail.  So what IS a press
release and how do you write one that will actually get placed?
Let's go over a few basics that will help you in your press
campaign.</P>

<P><U>A Change In Target Audience</U><BR>
The first mistake commonly made is writing a press release
with your business target audience in mind.  Unlike advertis-
ing copy, which is written to appeal to your customer, a press
release is written to appeal to a journalist.<BR>

The journalist is not someone who is seeking to buy your
product or service.  A journalist is looking to fill a news need.
When writing a press release, you must meet that need by fill-
ing the reporter's requirements.<BR>

Rather than answering the question, "What's in it for me",
answer the question, "Why would ABC magazine's readers
care"?<BR>

The headline also takes on a new focus.  Rather than using a
headline proclaiming the benefits of your product, use a head-
line that proclaims its newsworthiness.</P>

<P><U>Do Your Homework</U><BR>
One common error is submitting a press release without first
reading the publication.  It is virtually impossible to provide
timely, news-oriented information to a site or magazine if you
have no idea what interests their readers have.<BR>

Do a little homework before submitting.  Visit the Web and look
at the stories the site offers.  Buy a copy of the magazine or
newspaper and review the common interests of its readers.  By
understanding what the publication is looking for, you will be
able to fulfill the need and thus get a much better response from
your press release.</P>

<P><U>Don't Call Us, We'll Call You</U><BR>
The biggest irritant reporters have is receiving calls from writers
asking if the press release was received.  Worse yet, asking if it
was read.  Journalists are very busy people.  They get hundreds
of press releases a day.  I have actually heard reporters say that
they through away the releases of those people who call them.
<BR>
Resist the urge to phone.  Once you submit your press release,
rest assured you will be contacted if there is an interest.</P>

<p><U>Put It In the Right Hands</U><BR>
Just like advertisements, press releases must be placed in
strategic areas.  Search the Web for outlets to run your
release.  A few I have gotten good response from are:<BR>

http://www.businesswire.com<BR>
http://www.internet.com<BR>
http://www.prnewswire.com<BR>

Also, email your release to the appropriate person at individual
magazines, newspapers and Web sites.  Target those that would
be read by your customers.  Be sure to find the correct name
and email address for the reporter who handles stories related
to your business.  Releases that are sent to incorrect contacts
are most likely thrown away... not forwarded on to someone else.</P>

<p><U>KISS</U><BR>
Keep it short silly!  Press releases are not meant to tell the
whole story.  They are meant to give the reporter an idea of
what's happening in your business that their readers need to
know about.  If the journalist would like additional information
or would like to arrange for an interview, he/she will call.</P>

<P>Press releases should be approximately 400 words - 500
maximum.</P>
<P>
I know, all this sounds like a list of nit-picky rules.  Not really.
 Just like with advertising copy, you must give your reader what
he needs.  Write a newsworthy release that meets the criteria
of the reporter and his/her subscribers.  The time you take to
do so will pay off.  As you know - when you fill a need, you get
results!</P>
