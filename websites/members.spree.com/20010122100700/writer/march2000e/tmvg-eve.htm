The Rape of Eve

<P align=justify><FONT size="+1">
	Temptation is said to be sweet, if this is so (and I definitely do not deny it), then Eve was the sweetest, most tempting thing I had ever tasted... So enflamed was I, in the throes of passion for her, my desire became legendary and the events which followed, mythical...
<P align=justify>
	There she lay a mere child amidst the flora of The Garden. For many, many days, and many, many nights, I watched her hidden from her view. Her perfection and innocence immediately reminded me of Heaven for she glowed with the same radiance as that of a Cherub... She caused in my wicked and hateful heart, a stirring of love that I had not felt for some time... Had not felt since before the fall...
<P align=justify>	Each day and night that I looked upon her, this love grew... At first, I simply adored her; I found pleasure in merely gazing at her and her angelic movements of grace and beauty...
<P align=justify>	Her hair flowed in curling locks about her fair, seraphic skin... Evoking in me a feeling of dark mystery; as if she held inside of her some secret truth that was intended for me to uncover...
<P align=justify>	The more I saw of her, the more this feeling inside of me intensified... The more I imagined that her features, her beauty, her grace, her perfect form, her mystery, were meant for me and me alone, the more determined I became to make her mine.
<P align=justify>	This love inside then changed... It went from being a simple feeling of watching from a distance, to an incessant need to get closer... In order to unlock her secrets, I must get inside...
<BR><P align=justify>	
	While she slept, I (in the form of the serpent [a symbol of divine knowledge, tongue-in-cheek of course]) would creep in close... My serpent's tongue flicking in tastes of her female fragrance and odeurs... Temptation is indeed sweet, yet the desire it breeds, bitter; and the hunger it arouses, more bitter still, for it is a hunger that one never wants sated... Only to hunger more...
<P align=justify>	I would wait patiently in the grass till she reached those deepest stages of sleep... Then my serpent form would be used to inspire dreams within her... I would entwine about her thighs, teasing succulent skin with the flagellating rhythms of my tongue... The pulse of my constricting form would be interpreted by her as the tender touch from a dream-lover... Her dreams were filled with desire, a desire to know more about herself, to know more about the snake, and the knowledge of the mysterious things he promises to provide... The joys and pleasures of knowing about oneself and the mysteries of being alive...
<P align=justify>	Although she had yet to see me, I had already filled her soul with a desperate yearning to know... I had planted the seed of Sin in the Garden of Paradise, and now had only to wait a short time before the Nature of it was to be borne...
<P align=justify>
	Do I frighten you m'love?
<P align=justify>	I have never seen a creature such as you?
<P align=justify>	Never?
<P align=justify>	Well, not like this... I mean, not whilst awake...
<P align=justify>	Tell me more...
<P align=justify>	At night, strange visions come to me... Perhaps creatures of the night...
<P align=justify>	Do they frighten you?
<P align=justify>	Yes... And no...
<P align=justify>	You are blushing
<P align=justify>	What does it mean to blush...<P align=justify>
	It means your face speaks where you feel you must hide your feelings... These visions which arise to your sight at night may alarm you a bit, but moreso, they excite you... They excite you with a feeling of wanting to know more about them. They draw out of you things you have hidden inside you, things which you cannot speak, but must rely on the color of your cheek to say the words for you...
<P align=justify>	Yes... I believe I am blushing again...
<P align=justify>	Yes m'pretty, you are... As rosy as this apple here... These things you seek I can show you, but in me you must trust completely; you must keep these things secret, let not even the color of your cheek speak a word of them... I will see you again m'love...
<P align=justify>	Must you go now!
<P align=justify>	Yes... But only think of me and I will always be near to you...
<BR><P align=justify>
	My apathy towards Him intensified. Why must He keep her like a child? Why will He not allow her to become what she will; why in this paradise will He not let the most beautiful flower bloom?
<P align=justify>	Why does He create things of such beauty, then imprison them within the confines of their own form... Why does He keep these beautiful things at such a distance, and for such a short time?
<P align=justify>	I grew impatient. Each day she eyed the fruit. The yield of the tree she must not touch... And why must she not touch it? Because He didn't want her to know the truth...
<P align=justify>	Each day as the fruit ripened on the branches, I noticed that she ripened as well. 
<P align=justify>	Knowledge I possessed. Knowledge of life and death, knowing that she, like the fruit of the tree, was only a temporary thing... The truth of the apple is that it is to whither and die; it is to fall from its branch, and let its seeds spill forth from its decaying corpse... Only in this way will His Garden continue to exist, to exist at her expense... I hated Him more for this than anything else... Placing the value of His Garden above that of my most precious Eve...
<P align=justify>	I concluded then: The truth of Life may take her from me and she may be forced to accept the fate He has bestowed upon her, but before she goes, I shall take her away from Him...
<BR><P align=justify>
	Her dreams made her restless... By day she felt trapped by Life's tedium of tending to the Garden... She longed to possess that which she was told not to have... She began to resent Him for keeping her from the things she wished to know...
<P align=justify>	Was this a part of Divine Nature; did Eve and I have this in common, was this desire the seed within all existing things? Were we all meant to fall from His branches so that our seeds may be sown to perpetuate life? In defiance do we really defy, or is our defiance merely the necessary act of falling from the Tree, and in so doing, our seeds are sown accordingly...
<P align=justify>	Each day, she longed for the freedom of the night and awaited sleep in hopes that I would return... Yet the following day, she desired more and more to know the things I had promised to show her... She could wait no more...   
<BR><P align=justify>	  
	I came to you last night whilst you slept... I whispered softly into your ear and made you smile...
<P align=justify>	And what did you say?
<P align=justify>	I said: Now I have you right where I want you...
<BR><P align=justify>
	One must understand, that giving in to one's temptations brings about a finality to the whole circumstance of desire. Before the desired thing is acquired, one is essentially in a state of limbo, wavering between not-having and then having... Tiny victories sum up as progress towards objectives, urging one on with positive reinforcement, providing a satisfying impetus to push on... Yet once the objective is reached, once the final battle is won and the war over, once you hold the thing you desire in the palm of your hand, the reason for having been tempted vanishes...
<P align=justify>	Perhaps this is the truth of the fruit... Perhaps this is the truth of existence itself; the desire to possess is the desire to feed on that which is desired... Yet once we have wholly consumed that which we desire, once we have eaten our fill, our desire is gone...
<BR><P align=justify>
	I realized then, in the moment that Eve held the apple: what made her so appealing to me was not so much her beauty (although she shone like a star bright in the day, no other flower even compared...), I was attracted rather to her puerile innocence, her uncorrupted spirit, an empty space just waiting to be filled... She was to me after all, a portion of Heaven, and a chance to gain something of it back... 
<BR><P align=justify>	Yet in the moment that she took the first bite, something about her changed... Wisdom has a strange way of bringing on age; with her innocence gone, and that empty space of her soul filled with the knowledge of Life, in an instant, Eve permutated from childhood to adult... 
<BR><P align=justify>	As the open air began to brown the apple where she had bitten, she became aware of her own nakedness and felt a certain danger in being exposed... The truth of Life, the fact of change was suddenly realized, she felt then, as she dropped the apple, something she had never felt before, something I first felt long, long ago: The fear of falling...  
<BR><P align=justify>
	His anger arrived as a tempest ravaging The Garden. For her transgressions, He placed upon her mortal form the curse of ambivalence... She would forever desire to place herself at the mercy of the serpent, yet, she would also forever fear him...
<BR><P align=justify>
	I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee...
<BR><P align=justify>
	The storm drove Eve from The Garden, and the truth of a whole new world was introduced to her... Thus was borne the human struggle of life; which in truth, is a matter of seeing through the deception that was Paradise... 
	The seed <P align=justify>which I had planted within her whilst in Eden, that which has come to be known as 'Sin', was the revelation of the truth that although things will be desired, things, like desire, like Life itself, is fleeting, and no thing lasts forever; and all things, especially desire, eventually fall; and the only way to survive it, is to learn how to pick your broken self back up afterwards, and move on...
