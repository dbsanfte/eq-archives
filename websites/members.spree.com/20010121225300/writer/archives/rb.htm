<P align=justify>
        In the largest tent of the Tupenot village, six men sat in a semi-circle facing their chief, Wolverine Jaw.  Cassava Color spoke first.
<P align=justify>       "Not six moons have passed since Porcupine did the same thing to my tent.  Luckily, his stitches were not strong and we were able to get out with no trouble.  But to this day, my flap is torn and I lie awake many nights listening for him."
<P align=justify>       Meandering Water rose quickly.  "When he put nettles in my body camouflage, Chief, it was no big deal, they were easy to wash off, I even laughed with the others.  But when he sprinkled marseeds in the goat feed, it made them dance and bite for three straight days. The ram still has a mischievous eye and the children fear him."
<P align=justify>       Tossing Wolverine interrupted.  
<P align=justify>       "I know your heart, father.  In the fourteen winters since Soft Like Evening and Flitting Porcupine went up, Spinning Porcupine has been your son and my little brother.  We have watched him grow, moon by moon, and delighted in his companionship.  He is honest, and despite what many in this room may think, he is kind and worthy." 
<BR><BR><HR><BR><BR>
<P align=justify>                                               

        
        The night before, while the village slept, Spinning Porcupine had worked quickly and silently.  Stitching a neighbor's wigwam shut was, of course, an old and tired gag - but the thought of Nose Like A Bear and his wives thrashing around in the morning made Spinning Porcupine's body shake with swallowed giggles. He had made the stiches very tight.
<P align=justify>       When dawn came, the village awoke to much yelling and pounding from Nose Like A Bear's tepee.  Spinning Porcupine joined in the confusion of the rapidly growing crowd.  When enough people had gathered, he turned toward the wildly rocking tent.
<P align=justify>       "Hey, Bear Nose!"  he shouted.  "What seems to be the problem in there?"
<P align=justify>       "Porcupine, is that you?"  came the muffled reply.  The pounding became fierce.  "I swear by the Sun, Porcupine, if you had anything to do with this...."  A woman's voice broke shrilly through the thick hide wall.  "Whataya mean 'if', you great water pig?  Who else would do this?  I told you it was Porcupine from the first -- You never listen to a word I say..."    
<P align=justify>       "Be silent, hag-woman," Nose Like A Bear bellowed.  The crowd tittered.
<P align=justify>        "You're dead, Porcupine.  You hear me? Dead......"
<P align=justify>       "Dead? oh really!  Who's gonna kill me, Nose?  You?  You can't even find your way out of your house!"  The crowd laughed.
<P align=justify>       When the overweight Nose Like A Bear, followed by his two bickering and even chunkier wives, managed to squeeze through a small slit near the tent's bottom, wearing nothing but tiny sleep cloths, the crowd erupted.  Spinning Porcupine fell to the ground paralyzed with glee.<P align=justify>
        Nose Like A Bear crawled a bee-line to the prostrate prankster and straddled his scrawny chest.  Many in the crowd were still roaring with laughter, but those in front could see the knife and the rage in Nose Like A Bear's eyes.  The blade was an inch from the helpless little man's throat.  The crowd went silent.
<P align=justify>       "Prepare yourself, gnat-dropping,"  screamed Nose Like A Bear.  "I will now send you to the Predecessors!"
<P align=justify>       Spinning Porcupine felt the pressure of the cold steel against his neck.  His eyes clamped shut in anticipation of the slicing blade.  His entire body trembled. Perhaps he had gone too far.  <P align=justify>        
        A sudden powerful kick caught Nose Like A Bear's right shoulder.  The knife flew from his hand as he toppled from his victim's chest into the dust. Spinning Porcupine gasped, then vomited.
<P align=justify>       Chief Wolverine Jaw's foot throbbed with pain from the kick but he was not about to show it.  In his thirty-three years as the group's leader he had never seen such a display.  Tupenot against Tupenot!  Veins pulsed in his wizened neck as he stood above his warring subjects.  He turned to fix Nose Like A Bear with his fiercest gaze.
<P align=justify>       "Shame on you, Nose! I am stunned and deeply saddened.  This is not cause for killing, not even for hurting.  You are a Tupenot, a lover of life and all the Predecessors bring, not a killer of childish men who run pranks in the night.  We will speak of this later."  
<P align=justify>       The Chief dropped suddenly, kneeling full weight on Spinning Porcupine's sternum.  He took the young man's ears, pulling him so close their noses almost touched.  "You know there will be council on this, don't you my son?"  he whispered. 
<P align=justify>       Chief Wolverine Jaw stood, raising his arms to the crowd.  "Council tonight!"
<BR><BR><HR><BR><BR>
<P align=justify>                                               .
        
        Tossing Wolverine moved to the center of the wigwam and knelt before his father.  "Father, consider this before you make your decision.  Spinning Porcupine is funny, he thinks  funny.  Some men have a natural way with canoes and fishing, some are good with the crops, many are proficient builders -- but Porcupine makes the Tupenot laugh.  That's important, too, isn't it, father?  I know you will decide wisely, Dad, but please remember he is my little brother."
<P align=justify>       Chief Wolverine Jaw waved and the counselors filed out.  "Tell him to come here now,"  he said softly.  "Now."

<P align=justify>       Spinning Porcupine walked arm in arm with Tossing Wolverine to the chief's tent.  He opened the flap and hesitated, looking back at Tossing Wolverine for assurance before entering alone.
<P align=justify>       The old man sat cross legged on a thatched mat in the center of the floor, silently watching the quivering young man.  Despite himself, a grin began to curve the corners of his wrinkled mouth.
<P align=justify>       Spinning Porcupine had always made him smile.  He truly loved the boy -- his intelligence, his energy, and, yes, even his mischief.  And the chief loved that the boy so resembled his long-passed mother, Soft Like Evening.  The eager smart eyes, the small but strong bone structure, the straight posture -- the person.  So much like her.  Fourteen winters since I've seen my daughter's beautiful face?  Impossible!   The chief swallowed hard.
<P align=justify>       "Sit here, next to me, Porcupine."  Wolverine Jaw patted the mat beside him.  His tone was deep and subdued.  The young man sat with his head bowed.  The chief turned.  "Look at me, boy,"  he said softly.
<P align=justify>       "You have truly done it this time,"  the chief began.  "Nose Like A Bear wants your hide and the rest of the village has just about had it with you and your silliness.  And I really don't blame them, Porcupine.  You have promised time after time to control your prankish ways, but you never do.  I know there is no malice in the crazy things you do, but that doesn't make Meandering Ways' goats give good milk or Nose Like A Bear feel less humiliated, my son."  
<P align=justify>       The chief took the boy's hand.  "Porcupine, as of tomorrow's dawn, you are banished from this camp for a period of ten days.  You will take with you a knife, a flint, a spool of filat for fishing and a skin for water.  Nothing else, Porcupine, nothing.  Sleeping Sea Lion will care for your dog.  It is my deepest wish that during this time you will come to understand, once and for all, the hurt you have caused this village and that the Tupenot are not your playthings."   The old man let go of the boy's moist hand and stared blankly ahead.  "Go now, Spinning Porcupine, you must rest.  Tomorrow will come too soon."  
<P align=justify>       Wolverine Jaw watched the boy close the flap behind him.  He shut his eyes tightly, trying to feel any sign of forgiveness from the small beaded bracelet in his hand.  Temporary exile was the ultimate Tupenot punishment.  Wolverine Jaw had issued the sentence only three times in his twenty-eight years as chief. Though the jungle could be quite dangerous to a solitary traveller, it was the rejection by the group -- both symbolic and real -- that was the true punishment.  To a Tupenot, being separated from his brothers and sisters was a kind of death.          I'm so sorry, my lovely daughter.           
<P align=justify>         
        The bamboo shifted lazily in the river breeze as Spinning Porcupine made his way slowly through the jungle growth.  He'd always found the high whistling sound of the cane pleasant, comforting.  But it was now hurrying him along.  It would soon be dark and he had to get to the clearing at the bend of the river before nightfall.  He could not camp among the mangroves and bamboo. Too many mosquitoes.  Too wet to light a fire to keep the snakes and jaguars away.  He pushed harder.  Blasted mangrove.  He tripped, falling hard on his back.  As he lay there trying to catch his breath, he was seized with remorse. 
<P align=justify>       Was it worth it?  No.  Was sewing Nose Like A Bear's tent shut a smart thing to do?  No.  Spinning Porcupine gazed dully up at the swaying canopy. Are you a thoughtless manquo who should fall into the river and be sliced among the rocks, freeing the village from your stupid and horrible ways?  Yes.  <P align=justify>  
        He picked himself up and continued through the growth.  And tell the truth, was the sight of the almost-naked Nose family pounding, bickering and slicing their way out of the wigwam, all that funny?   He could now hear the water lapping the beach of the river's bend. As the sun slid behind the bamboo,  Spinning Porcupine stepped into the clearing - aching, exhausted and filled with self loathing.  He sat cross legged at the edge of the water.  The cool spray splashing his face made him grin.  As the picture in his head became clearer, the grin grew into a wide smile, then a giggle.  Then, with the total image of the thrashing Nose family re-playing in his head, came the loud, high-pitched staccato known to every man, woman and child in the village.  The Porcupine laugh.  Predecessors protect me, yes!  Yes, it was funny.  
<P align=justify>       The small fire of dead mangrove and cedar bark hissed and popped in the warm still air.  Spinning Porcupine lay on his back watching the black smoke suck into the heavens.  In an instant, he fell into deep slumber and dreamed of his village.

<BR><BR><HR><BR><BR>
<P align=justify>
        
        Ensign Eduardo Quentin' de Salazar's sleeves snapped crisply as he rode the launch's bow.  His tall, angular body and sharp nose seemed to cut the wind's resistance.  He craned his neck casually to glare at the men behind him.   
<P align=justify>       "Faster, Faster, gutter hounds!"  he shouted at his men.  He didn't see the small brown figure run from the beach at the bend in the river.  He didn't see the bend in the river, either.    
<P align=justify>       "Stop, Stop!"  he screamed at the oarsmen.  The paddles lifted from the swirling brown water too late.  With a shudder and the piercing scrape of sand against wooden hull, the boat beached hard.  Ensign Salazar tumbled off the bowsprit onto the beach in a blur of cursing and sand and escaping air.  
<P align=justify>       Twenty-two year old Father Bertrando was the first to reach the sprawled, motionless body of the officer.  He knelt next to Salazar's head.  "Back!"  he shouted at the men, brandishing his silver crucifix to keep them at bay.  "The man is dead.  Dead, do you hear me?  This is now Church business!"  He unfolded a white satin surplus, draped it around his neck and began administering the last rites for his fallen commander.  "Deos morti, lo vidus sperum, lux peria,"  the priest intoned, "Somus de finus a..."  A buried hand shot up, spraying the priest's face with sand, grasping him firmly by the throat.   "Before you send me to God, father -- how's the launch?"  
<P align=justify>       
        From deep within the mangrove, Spinning Porcupine watched in utter disbelief as the twenty white giants with shiny hats strained against the huge canoe.  They had hair on their faces and they were covered from the neck down in strange, colorful vestments.  They made loud, unpleasant sounds at each other.  The giant who had fallen from the front of the canoe made the loudest and most unpleasant sounds.  
<P align=justify>       He found the creatures terrifying in their manner and size, but there was something about their general clumsiness and their hats that Spinning Porcupine found vaguely amusing.  
<P align=justify>       
        As the launch slid slowly into the water, the men clambered back aboard, quickly readying their oars.  "Hard starboard!" shouted Ensign Salazar.  The boat pointed down river.  "Forward!"  It  splashed swiftly around the bend and out of Spinning Porcupine's view.
<P align=justify>
        Spinning Porcupine's head hurt with wonder.  Was it a dream?  What were those creatures?  Are they evil?  Will they go to the village?  On the river, the giants would make the village by nightfall!  But why should they be evil?  Maybe they mean no harm at all - just lost visitors from a far away island who will ask for directions from Wolverine Jaw then go away.  Anyway, the village has forty-three grown men and women.  The strangers number only twenty.  But still, they seemed so angry with one another.  They might be angry at my people, too.  Terror gripped Spinning Porcupine.  I am sure they will be angry at my people!   
<P align=justify>       He pushed fiercely through the unyielding jungle,  oblivious to the scraping and slashing from the mangrove and razorvine.  The trail will take too long.  He thought  only of the villagers -- the Tupenot.  His people, who had shown him only kindness and love -- and much patience -- now needed him.  They could be hurt, or killed.  Could be taken from him by the white giants.  The chief's words came back to him in a stinging clarity.  ".... hurt you have caused, Porcupine." The hurt.   Desperately, he pushed on.
<P align=justify>
        Spinning Porcupine didn't notice the air beginning to cool his cheeks or the sweet aroma of jasmine filling the jungle stillness.  Though bleeding and exhausted, his progress remained steady.  His body moved instinctively.  Faster.  Faster!  He wished he had been more interested in the running games played by the village's young men.  No, not me.  Not Porcupine the clown.  I was always too busy figuring ways to trip the contestants.  What a jerk!  He quickened the pace.  He was startled by a small mango bat veering about his face, chasing mosquitoes. Suddenly, Spinning Porcupine became all too aware of the dusk surrounding him.  I am too late!  The white beings could be there already.  I have failed my brothers and sisters!  
<P align=justify>        He fell to his knees, thrusting bleeding arms and hands upward, staring blindly at the black green jungle canopy.
<P align=justify>       A loud high wail of agonizing despair shook the heavy balm of the forest.  A group of howler monkeys echoed the complaint.  

<P align=justify>
        Judging by the capacity of the nets and the number and size of the beached canoes , Salazar figured the village's population at around fifty adults and maybe seventy-five children.  Fifty savages armed with knives, spears and rocks against the guns, swords and armor of his battle-hardened men.  Salazar liked the odds.  He was so confident in his advantage he ordered three men to remain on the beach to guard the launch.            
<P align=justify>       As the narrow trail began to climb, Salazar and his men could  hear faint voices and laughter ahead.  As the voices grew louder, the soldiers reduced their pace.  Salazar's order to load pistols quietly passed down to each of his men.
<P align=justify>       Salazar was the first to reach the top of the rise. He raised his left hand and the silent entourage came to a halt.  Below, surrounded by rolling jungle-covered hills and lightly shrouded by a thin fog, lay the  valley of the Tupenot village.  In the center of the clearing stood twenty-four conical tents in three rows of eight.  The tents were the light beige of sun-washed animal hide, but the sun's reflection off the surrounding hills gave them a greenish tinge.  Beyond, and to the side of the tents were well-tended fields and livestock corrals.  Twenty paces in front of the first row of tents was a circular fire pit, which seemed to be the center of activity.  A number of small dark women buzzed and laughed around a large blackened cauldron hanging heavily above a recently lit fire.  Fifteen paces to the right, naked men and children cheered as an older man threw a flowered hoop toward a stick planted in the dirt.  The villagers were so involved in their cooking and playing, they didn't notice that seventeen huge, white, shiny-headed beings had descended upon them.
<P align=justify>       At the trail's end, next to the entry totem, the men knelt fifteen abreast, aiming their pistols randomly at the villagers.  Salazar and the priest stood a few paces in front.  
<P align=justify>       "In the name of Her Majesty the Queen Isabella of Spain, I, Ensign Eduardo Quentin' de Salazar, claim this village and all who live here as the right and legal property of Spain."     
<P align=justify>       The villagers spun toward the voice.  And froze.  Nothing could have prepared the Tupenot for such a sight.  These were not people from another village.  Perhaps they weren't people at all -- maybe they were big white animals with shiny heads.  Even the children went slack-jawed and breathless.  Curiosity and terror gripped the villagers.  The Tupenot could not understand the one giant's gibberish, but it did not sound at all like a greeting.  And all of the kneeling visitors appeared to be so angry.  Slowly, one-by-one, the villagers turned their gazes toward Wolverine Jaw, hoping to see direction or at least a comforting look of understanding in the wise old man's eyes.                 
<P align=justify>       Wolverine Jaw tried hard to mask his confusion -- and fear.  He had never let his people down before and he would not fail them today.  It was definitely time to act. But what the hell are these things?   The chief sensed the anger emanating from the visitors, and noticed the long knives hanging from their sashes.  Perhaps, the shiny tubes they held were weapons, too.  Whatever he would do, he would do cautiously.       
<P align=justify>       Slowly, Chief Wolverine Jaw extended his left hand and raised his middle finger in the Tupenot sign of welcome.  He walked carefully toward the big white visitors.  Ensign Salazar leveled his pistol.  A horrible explosion ripped the air.  Wolverine Jaw fell, clutching his side.  He lay still in the dirt.  The flowered game ring came to rest beside him.
<BR><BR><HR><BR><BR>          
<P align=justify>                                                                               It was deepest night, under the rising moon, when Spinning Porcupine smelled the cane.  The sweet, earthen aroma of ripe sugar cane that fell over the village every summer.  The smell he had come to know a little too well as a kid when the grown-ups made him and the other little ones bag and tie the enormous shoots.    
<P align=justify>       Home! 
<P align=justify>       He ran blindly through the cane, welcoming each plant's impediment as a treasured friend. If only I still have time.  He collided with a structure of wood and gourds, and fell.  The scare crow!  He rolled slowly to his left until he felt the soft earth beneath him.  The trail.  
<P align=justify>       He lay on the trail for a moment, catching his breath, feeling the day's heat still lingering in the worn, familiar path.  He moved stealthily up the path, toward the ridge, under the twine and into the pig confine. He had seen no one.  He stood up, looking in the direction of the camp, listening carefully for whatever noises might be on the night breeze.
<P align=justify>       A blinding thud and he was down again.  Meandering Way's ram stood victoriously in the moonlight, stamping the dirt, waving his curved horns menacingly.  Those eyes.  Goats in the pig corral?   Not only Meandering Way's goat, but all the goats were there. In the pig pen!  The goat snicked his shin as he bolted over the fence.  Demon goat! 
<P align=justify>       Faintly, the slow rhythmic chant of familiar voices began to pour over the hill, filling Spinning Porcupine with dread.  Though he had learned the words long ago, nothing could have prepared him for that mournful sound.       
<P align=justify>       "Sure it hurts like crazy.  <P align=justify>
        Did you think that it would not?                <P align=justify>
        You've lived, already, three more years <P align=justify>
        than what we would have thought.                               <P align=justify>                                                                                Your time with Tupenot was great,                             <P align=justify> But now the Predecessors wait.  <P align=justify>
        Just let death come to you.<P align=justify>                                                    
        Toodle-loo, toodle-loo.<P align=justify>
        Let it come to you. <P align=justify>
        Toodle-loo."
        
<P align=justify>       The Tupenot Death Chant.        

<P align=justify>       The chanting grew louder as Porcupine neared the top of the ridge.  

<P align=justify>       "Poruseno.  Poruseno!"  Salazar kicked the nodding private.  
<P align=justify>       "Go shut them up."  Salazar pointed a long handled fork toward the corral as he turned to his men.  
<P align=justify>       "Listen up, everybody. This is what we have for tomorrow."  He motioned toward a caged jaguar pacing nervously in a bamboo cage.        "Tomorrow, two of you bastards are going to lift this thing all the way back to the launch.  Good luck.  Everybody else -- I mean everybody!  Everybody else will hold the chain.  Make no mistake!  One slave escapes -  one stupid Spaniard gets shot in the forehead and is left to rot, stinking in this green hell, till mighty Isabella herself drops her teacup from your aroma.  So, eat well, gentlemen."  He pointed to the steaming cauldron.  
<P align=justify>       "What ever it is, it smells good, and the savages look much healthier than you lot ever did.  Gotta be better than salt pork and rotten potatoes, eh?," he chuckled.  
<P align=justify>       The chanting cut through his laughter.  "Eat well, scalawags, then go to sleep.  Tomorrow requires well-rested soldiers."  
<P align=justify>       The chanting burned into his head.  
<P align=justify>       "Poruseno, shut them up!"

<P align=justify>       Spinning Porcupine stared in horror from his vantage at the crest of the ridge.  The white giants sat in the middle of the square, circling a tremendous fire.  Forty paces to the right, in the goat corral, the villagers rocked back and forth in somber unison, kneeling in a circle around a prostrate figure on the ground.  ".... your time with Tupenot was great, but now the Predecessors wait, just let ..."  Two white giants stood at the gate.  Each held a long shiny blade at the ready. 
<P align=justify>       What have these beings from beyond done to my people?   Porcupine slid silently on his belly down the hill, careful to keep the large stone entry totem between himself and the intruders.  From behind the rock he was able to get a closer look at the stricken person lying in the center of the corral.  
<P align=justify>       Chief Wolverine Jaw.  Father!

<P align=justify>       He looked toward the white men sitting around the fire.  As my father lies wounded and dying in the goat corral, these  heaps of manquo dung sit talking and laughing, preparing to eat our evening meal.  
<P align=justify>       A feeling Spinning Porcupine had never experienced grew in his stomach.  It flowed outward through his veins, clenching his fists, tightening the muscles in his face, until his entire body was consumed in white-hot hatred.  Predecessors ..., show me how to rid the village of this plague!
<P align=justify>
        Immediately, a soft low voice -- a young man's voice -- cut clearly through Porcupine's anger.  It was a voice Porcupine had not heard since he was a young boy, but he recognized it at once.  It was his father.  Not Wolverine Jaw but his real father, Flitting Porcupine.
<P align=justify>        Listen, said the voice, sounding to Porcupine as if it were coming from the nearby bushes, until he realized the voice was in his thoughts.  First - settle down.  You'll be of no help if you can't think clearly.  
<P align=justify>       "Dad?" Spinning Porcupine said softly, afraid he would scare the voice away.  
<P align=justify>       I know you have many questions to ask me, son, but there's no time for that.  So, just know that your mom and I are doing fine and we'll have plenty of time to talk with you later on. Your mom couldn't come with me because she's busy working on Wolverine Jaw.  Right now the Tupenot are in big trouble and you're the only one who can save them.  So, let me ask you something, Porcupine,  the voice continued.  How do you like herding the pigs and goats? 
<P align=justify>       Spinning Porcupine thought this a most casual and inappropriate question, considering the gravity of his current situation. But it was, after all, his long-dead father wanting to make small talk.  
<P align=justify>       "I like it fine."
<P align=justify>        Don't lie to me, Porcupine, you hate it, the voice said sharply.  
<P align=justify>       "Yes, you are right, Father,I do hate it." 
<P align=justify>        How about the fields, lad?  Are you better at that?  
<P align=justify>       "No, my father, I'm sorry to say I am not.  Listen, dad, could we have this talk anoth ......"
        <P align=justify> Silence! the spirit interrupted.  Is there anything you like to do?  Anything you're good at?         
<P align=justify>       Porcupine hung his head, shamed.  "I play stupid pranks on the people who love me and they hate me for it.  That's what I do." 
<P align=justify>       All the people hate you?
<P align=justify>        "Yes, at one time or another, it depends on who was most recently hurt by my ...."
<P align=justify>        Shut up, Porcupine, and listen.  I don't have much time.  They probably don't tell you this when they speak of me and Soft As Evening, but I and my father before me, and his father, were all like you.  Every single Porcupine from the beginning of time was a prank-boy.  I myself was banished for twenty-seven days by Wolverine Jaw for tieing all the canoes with filat thread during the night, then yelling 'steelhead' in the morning.  It was wonderful, my son, you would have loved it.  They all fell thrashing about in the river, shouting my name.  When they eventually waddled onto the beach, completely wet and muddy, they ....."  The voice cleared its throat.  Two canoes were damaged, though, and I still feel kinda bad about that.  And there were many, many worse that they never got me for.  But, you know what I remember the most, Porcupine?
<P align=justify>        "No, father." 
<P align=justify>        The laughter on the  beach.  That's right, Porcupine, the happy sound of Tupenot laughter.  And that's the point, Spinning Porcupine.  You've seen what goes on in this village;  The endless planting, reaping, fishing, cooking, eating, playing stupid games - planting, reaping, fishing, over and over, on and on.  It is a tiresome, boring existence.  They need you, Porcupine.  Just like they've needed every Porcupine through the ages -- to break up the brain-numbing tedium of this place.  They won't admit it, but you are every bit as important to them as their blessed fish or seeds.  Every bit as important.  You make people laugh, son.  Wolverine Jaw is a fuddy-duddy and Nose Like a Bear is a lunatic.   
<P align=justify>       Now listen very closely, boy-who-worries-too-much;  Go back up the trail into the forest.  Go directly to the droop tree and cut three medium-sized branches.  On your way back to camp, gather as many marseeds as your hands can carry.  You will know what to do when you return... 
<P align=justify>       The voice began to fade.  Remember, my beautiful boy, your mom and I are standing beside you, and we know you'll do fine. 
<P align=justify>       As suddenly as it had come, the voice was gone.
        
<P align=justify>       Spinning Porcupine's thoughts raced as he crawled quietly up the hill toward the jungle.  "Dad, don't go yet," he whispered.  "Couldn't you just tell me what I'm supposed to do?  Dad? .....Father?"  I guess he knows what he's doing.  As Porcupine neared the grove of gnarly, black droops at the jungle's edge, his crawl became a run.  ...but I sure don't.  Droop branches and marseeds...Predecessors, please tell dad to come back!    He stopped at the first tree and quickly broke off the thickest branches he could manage.  He tied them together with a length of filat then tucked them under his arm.  As he ran back toward the camp, Porcupine filled his fists with seeds from the many maro bushes that grew along the trail.  When he reached the top of the rise, Porcupine returned to his belly crawl, clutching the branches to his side.  
<P align=justify>       The sound of the invaders' voices sent a cold shiver down his back.  He could feel the marseeds compressing in his fists as the unusual sensation from before again took Porcupine's mind and body.  This time, however, the burning hatred carried with it a stinging clarity of purpose.  I know, father.  I know what to do.     
<P align=justify>       Spinning Porcupine slithered down behind the totem rock.   He could see each of the beings was holding a Tupenot eating bowl, each staring at the priest stirring the steaming cauldron.     
<P align=justify>       Abruptly, the priest threw a large wooden ladle at the drooling men, sprinkling a few with the goat stew.  
<P align=justify>       "You want to eat?"  shouted the priest.  He lunged toward the men holding a goat's leg bone like a sword.  "Then pick your butts up and go find some wood for this fire.  I can't do everything."    The men scattered to the woods behind the last row of wigwams.  The priest yelled after them, shaking the bone over his head.  "I didn't sign on to be a cook.  On the Madonna, I didn't.  I am a priest, goddamn it, not a cook!"

<P align=justify>
        With the black-cloaked being and the other white giants away, Spinning Porcupine ran as fast as he could to the cauldron.  He dumped his fist loads into the simmering pot.  A hundred, maybe two hundred seeds.  He rubbed his hands together over the steaming liquid so that every last seed became part of the stew.  He returned to the totem and waited for the invaders to return.  I put only three seeds into Meandering Way's trough, and his ram is still crazy. 

<P align=justify>       Having filled each of their bowls, the white beings now sat closer to the fire, wordlessly devouring the Tupenot's meal.  Ensign Salazar had just ladled a second helping when seaman Rodriguez caught his eye.  The slightly built Rodriguez had been a favorite target of Salazar's jibes since they had departed Spain.  Salazar had begun making sport of Rodriguez a few years back when the two had served together on a copper run to the Canaries.   Rodriguez had noticed that Salazar could not take his eyes off of his wife, Paula, when she had come to the dock to say goodbye.  He was convinced that Salazar had it in for him out of sheer jealousy.  Rodriguez was truly afraid of Salazar, and Salazar loved it.            
<P align=justify>       "Hey, Rodriguez, has anything ever tasted so good?  Does your ugly wife cook you anything this good?"  A fire lit Salazar's eyes.  "Or is she too busy making it with the Moors in Marakesh?"   Seaman Rogdriguez didn't answer. 
<P align=justify>       Salazar walked slowly to the reclining sailor.  "Or is she too busy making it with the Moors in Marakesh?"  Salazar demanded, kicking Rodriguez' boot.  The seaman laconically raised the spoon to his mouth, unperturbed, staring at the heavens.  He was lost in the diamonds on black velvet of the tropical sky.  Without breaking his gaze, Rodriguez suddenly tugged hard at the back of Salazar's right knee, dropping him to the ground with a dull thud.  Rodriquez grabbed the larger man's neck with both hands. The stunned commander found himself nose to nose with Rodriguez staring into the young seaman's wide eyes. 
<P align=justify>       "Think."  Rodriguez pulled Salazar's neck so hard their heads hit,  ".... of what the odds are, me being commanded by you -- again.  ...Of all the ensigns, captains, commodores and admirals in Spain, I wind up having to take orders from the crudest and stupidest prick in maritime history for a second time.  This truly hurts my brain."  Rodriguez' face was a contorted mixture of bewilderment and anger.   "A day from the launch, one more day from the Santa Maria, and seventy-three days from my Paula in Barcelona -- and I'm here with you,  a man, who -- if true to his instincts -- will get us all killed."   Rodriguez' inched his hands upward against Salazar's chin, forcing the ensign to look at the stars.  "Those are the odds, asshole!"   
<P align=justify>       With that, Seaman Rodriguez let go of Salazar, crowed like a rooster and launched himself over the ensign's shoulders, landing by the fire in a perfect splits.  None of the others noticed Rodriguez' odd behavior because, like Rodriguez, every one of his shipmates now found himself in the powerful grip of the hallucigenic marseeds.  
<P align=justify>       The priest lay writhing on the ground crossing himself over and over.  Ensign Salazar, howling an ear-splitting battle cry, swung his powder bag over his head then flung it high into the fire. The explosion blew Seamen Ortiz and Pedraza clear over Nose Like a Bear's wigwam.  The rest of the white giants continued to dance and howl.  No one saw the thick black branches hurled into the fire.
<P align=justify>       Porcupine had forgotten how much he liked the smell of burning droop, though the sweet, dry aroma also wakened frightening memories of his childhood.  He thought of that frightening day when as a youngster, he got lost in the fields, and thought it would be a great idea to make a fire to signal his location.  As he sat and waited for the grown-ups to come, the first monkey dropped silently behind him.  With blinding speed, it grabbed Porcupine by the hair, snapped his head back and slapped his face hard.  Stunned, he watched the little manquo disappear into the trees.  The next monkey came, then the next, and the next, each manquo mimicking the performance of the first.   Finally, three large manquos snuffed the fire with great handsfull of dirt.  The three turned toward the terrified boy, arms akimbo, locking him in their yellow eyes for a moment, then plodding off to the jungle.
<P align=justify>       When Wolverine Jaw and the others found him, the young Porcupine was weeping hysterically, his face reddened by the monkey assault and his spirits very low.  Between sobs, the lad managed to ask the chief why the monkeys had been so mean to him.  Wolverine jaw waved the others away then sat beside Porcupine, holding him close.   
<P align=justify>       "Son, your pink face and the smoldering embers tell me what has happened here.  No, the manquos were not being mean.  They were being manquos."  The chief gently turned Porcupine's head to face him, wiping at the tears with his thumbs.  "Listen, and you must remember this, my son.   The Predecessors give us many things - food, water, shelter and happy times.  But the Predecessors demand certain things in return.  It's called 'The Way'".   
<P align=justify>       "You see, Porcupine, the Tupenot people don't own this land or its animals.  The Predecessors do.  We are only the custodians, the caretakers.  In return for all the wonderful things we are given, it is the Tupenot's job to preserve the land and to take care of all its creatures.  This is why we don't fish the same spot day after day, or make too many dams.  It is why a Tupenot will never kill a pregnant water pig or cut down young trees, or plant cane in the same field season upon season, or ...burn droop trees.  It is "The Way."  
<P align=justify>       "Now you are frightened and angry with the manquos, but think of all the fun times you and your friends have had running and climbing with the young manquos, or just watching them play in the trees.  Remember how their calls have warned us of approaching jaguar.  And, I think you know, manquo spoor makes the best fertilizer for our crops.    So you see, Porcupine, if it weren't for our little orange brothers and their turds, the Tupenot would have a much less happy existence.  And as much as you are angered and frightened by the manquos, they are even more upset with you.  You have destroyed part of a droop tree.  And you have betrayed their trust in us.  Just as the river and our crops make it possible for the Tupenot to live, the droop is necessary for the manquos' survival.  Its long branches provide their shelter, its leaves and insects their food.  Since time began, we have understood this and we leave droop trees alone.  This, my boy, is a very important part of "The Way."  By burning droop you have said to the manquos that you don't care about them or their needs and they responded in the only way a manquo can respond to a droop fire - snuffing the fire out and slapping the perpetrator silly."
<P align=justify>       
        
        Spinning Porcupine spotted the first manquo -- a huge orange male -- striding purposefully down the trail and into the chaos near the campfire.  
<P align=justify>       The monkey leaped, landing heavily onto the dancing Salazar's shoulders, grasping his hair with one hand while the flat white palm of the other hand slapped the ensign's face with a loud crack.  Salazar stopped his dance, weaving with the weight of the huge monkey on his shoulders.  The hand came down again and again. Salazar fell to his knees with the monkey holding him firmly in a headlock, slapping frantically.   As if signaled, a hundred monkeys leapt from the trees.  Rodriguez went for his sword as three young manquos brought him thudding to the ground.  The sounds of screeching and slapping echoed off the surrounding hills as the white giants fell on the ground in a blur of orange fur and flapping hands.    
<P align=justify>       Two large manquos upended the cauldron, emptying the remainder of the stew over the fire, extinguishing it.  The camp fell into an eerie darkness lit only by the stars and a crescent moon.  Three large manquos stood silently over the cowering priest with their hands on their hips. Then, as if on cue, the monkeys bounded, screeching into the trees.  
<P align=justify>       One by one, the shaken, pink-faced Spaniards rose to their feet, still reeling from the monkey slaps and the brain-bending marseeds.  They stared burning holes into Salazar as they formed a half circle before him.  A seaman in the front was the first to speak.  
<P align=justify>       "Salazar, get us the hell out of here. This land is bewitched and the people are all sorcerers who have used their incantations to pixilate our minds and call forth an army of fire-colored devil-monkeys.  We are not meant to be here.  If we stay here one more second it is an affront to God and we will all surely be killed."  The seaman began to weep.  Seaman Rodriguez was the next to speak. 
<P align=justify>       "One way or another -- with you or without you -- we are going to get in that damned launch right now and row as hard as we can back to the Santa Maria.  We will tell Columbus what has happened here.  He will surely understand why we brought nothing back with us.  He will thank us for not bringing anything from this cursed place."     
<P align=justify>       "Santa Maria, Santa Maria...."  The men moved forward, increasing the volume and cadence of the chant.  "Santa Maria, Santa Maria, Santa Maria...."   Salazar ran to the entry totem and leapt upon it.  He drew both pistols, leveling them at the approaching men.  He was standing directly above Spinning Porcupine.  Salazar screamed at the approaching men in a high, shrill quiver.       
<P align=justify>       "Not another step, you motherless bilge suckers."  Salazar didn't feel the fine filat thread gently looping his ankles.  "I am your commander, you will leave this island when I say to leave!"  The men stopped about twenty-five paces from Salazar, but the chanting grew louder - "Santa Maria, Santa Maria...."  
<P align=justify>       Careful to keep the totem between him and the white men, Porcupine slithered on his stomach as far from it as the filat would allow, holding the loose end in his teeth.  With only the light of the moon, Porcupine was barely able to make out the ranting silhouette on the totem rock.   Slowly, Spinning Porcupine took up the slack.  Salazar continued.                      
<P align=justify>       "We were sent here to bring back slaves and anything else of value we found in the New World, and by God, that's exactly..."  Suddenly, Rodriguez let out an agonized cry and ran straight for Ensign Salazar.  Immediately, Salazar cocked both pistols and aimed them at Rodriguez.  "Rot in hell, you bastard," bellowed Salazar as he pulled the triggers.  Porcupine grunted as he pulled the filat line with all his strength.      The weapons fired harmlessly in the air as Salazar's feet shot out from under him.  Salazar's chin cracked loudly on the totem.   As his consciousness faded, the ensign saw the blurry image of his men closing in on him. Porcupine scampered up the hill. He couldn't understand what the giants had been saying, but their mood was unmistakable. He didn't have to wait very long.    
<P align=justify>       
        Torch light shimmered off the white giant's hats as they marched two abreast out of the village.  The bamboo cage that had held the jaguar rode heavily on four of the men's shoulders.  Inside the cage lay Ensign Salazar in peaceful slumber.
<P align=justify>
        Spinning Porcupine listened carefully as the invaders' voices and the splash of their oars faded up the river.  He ran down the hill as fast as he could.  
<P align=justify>       "They're gone.  The white monsters have left us," Porcupine shouted as he neared the goat corral.  He vaulted easily over the bamboo fence, making his way through the ring of villagers, gathered around the still figure of Wolverine Jaw lying in the dirt of the corral.  
<P align=justify>       "Father!"  The young man kneeled at the old man's side, noticing the mixture of caked blood and smeared tuava root under the chief's left breast.  Spinning Porcupine tugged gently at the chief's lifeless hand.  Wolverine Jaw did not move.  He wasn't breathing.  "Father, oh my wonderful father,"  Porcupine wailed.  Tears rolled down the young man's face, splashing Wolverine Jaw's chest.  "I tried so hard to warn you about the white demons but the mangrove and the razorvine ...."  
<P align=justify>       Suddenly, the old man's hand seized Spinning Porcupine's wrist, pulling the young man closer.  Wolverine Jaw's eyes flashed open, sparkling as he let out a long exhale.  Porcupine stared wide-eyed as the chief's mouth curved into a sly grin.  "What kept you?" croaked the chief.  
<P align=justify>       The villagers burst into laughter as the old man slowly rose to his feet, clutching his wound, wincing with each laugh.  Nose Like A Bear's belly shook like a huge water skin as he stood laughing over the bewildered Porcupine.  He bent down to punch playfully at Porcupine's shoulder.  "Gotcha, little fella,"  grinned Nose Like a Bear.
<P align=justify>       Spinning Porcupine was a mixture of delight and curiosity.  Still on his knees, he looked up at Wolverine Jaw.  "But I thought the white monsters had killed you with the explosion.  I could hear everybody chanting the death chant, and I saw you fall, and there was blood  ...     Wolverine Jaw, leaning on Cassava Color for support, interrupted.       "Porcupine, everybody thought I was a goner.  Especially me.  I had lost so much blood and I was so weak, I thought for sure the Predecessors were about to take me.  When I began to lose consciousness, everybody started the death chant.  And that's when I had the visitation.  Guess who came to see me in my dream, Porcupine."  The chief didn't wait for a reply.  "Your mother, Soft Like Evening -- my lovely daughter."  Spinning Porcupine smiled broadly as the old man continued.  "First off, she told me I was going to be OK.  Then she told me the strangest thing I had ever heard.  She said said that you, Spinning Porcupine, would be the one to save the Tupenot from the marauders -- by doing what you do best.  No offense, lad, but I couldn't think of anything you did reasonably well -- let alone "best."  Then, like she was reading my thoughts, she said, 'Do not undervalue your grandson ever again.'  Then she told me she loved me, and that she forgave me for banishing you, and that I was a fuddy-duddy.  That was it, she was gone.  When I regained consciousness, I told the others about my visitation.  Right about then is when the white demons began acting crazy -- and I knew.  I remebered Meandering Way's goat, and I knew it was your doing.  I whispered to everybody to get a good seat, because Spinning Porcupine was about to "do what he does best."                                    
<P align=justify>       Nose Like A Bear got on his knees and motioned Porcupine to climb on his shoulders.  As Nose rose, the villagers cheered.       
<P align=justify>       "Porcupine! Porcupine! Porcupine!," rang the happy unison as the crowd filed through the corral gate.

        An unusually strong wester allowed the Santa Maria to sail before the wind, pushing her quickly and steadily across the choppy Atlantic toward Spain.  The mood on deck, a combination of a failed expedition's melancholy, tempered by the sweet anticipation of reunion and rest.
<P align=justify>       In the captain's stateroom, Columbus signed and dated his report to the Court of Ferdinand then sailed the quill neatly into the fire.  
 <P align=justify>      
        Two months later, the Madrid headlines read, "Columbus Discovers, Earth Flat."  Never again did a ship set sail for the New World.  Never again did the Tupenots, nor any of the small brown people of the Western Hemisphere, lay eyes on another white person.  The white giants knew to avoid that part of the universe.  Pizzaro never raped the Incas. Pat Garret never shot Billy the Kid.  There was no Cuban Missle crisis. And the Cuyahoga River never burned.
