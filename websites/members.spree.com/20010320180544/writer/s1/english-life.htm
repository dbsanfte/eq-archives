	<P>This past week there was a discussion on one of the lists I'm moderating 
concerning forgiveness. At what point do we forgive and move on 
when people have done harm, emotional or physical, to us? Now let 
me ask you another question, have you always been kind and loving 
to everyone? Think long and hard before answering that question. 
I know there are those who would exclaim, "no but I've never done 
anything as cruel or mean to anyone else like was done to me!" 
How do you know?</P>

<P>
The fact is, we come into contact with people everyday, directly 
or indirectly, and we never know what will upset another person. 
So rest assured there are those who think you've done them wrong. 
This article will address two points. The first point is, we must 
forgive others if we want the same to be done for us. There are 
so many people who think the world is at fault for the misguided 
behaviors of others. They justify their deep-seated mistrust by 
pushing everybody away,lumping us all into a category of backstabbing 
monsters waiting to get over on them. Then they wonder why trouble 
and troublesome people seems to find them. 
</P>
<P>
If you want a joyful existence and you want to leave behind an legacy 
of love then you must move on from the self-defeating attitude the 
world is against me. Hanging on to the mistrust of people is a indictment 
about you being like those you mistrust or worst yet, you feeling 
you deserve nothing but negativity from people. If for some reason 
you find you must officially release your embitterment, anger, or 
frustration then have a pity party. Spend one day griping about 
whatever it is that has been weighing heavily on your mind, but 
after that day harbor those feelings no more.</P>



<P>"When I read you walked away from your marriage I had a flashback. 
Like you I walked away from my marriage, unlike you I had invested 
twenty years with my husband. Even after leaving the marriage I 
fumed over what took place within it. On the advice of some friends 
I gave myself a pity party. The entire day was spent with me airing 
my anger towards my ex, my friends listened, nodded, hmmmed, and 
tsk, tsked. Maybe my friends alterior motive was for me to finally 
stop complaining about my ex, at the very least to stop complaining 
to them about him. Well it worked and I recommend others do the 
same to get over some painful hurts." Janice</P>
<P>
Now on to my second point. No one is responsible for your feelings. 
When we say someone hurt our feelings we're really saying we allowed 
that person power to influence our emotions. Why do these people 
hurt us? As humans we have an intense need to believe in something 
or someone, unfortunately when we put all our trust in people and 
things we're left with hurt feelings and disappointment. Why? Humans 
are imperfect. We deceive ourselves into thinking certain people 
will or will not do certain things and low and behold they do just 
what we thought they wouldn't. </P>


<P>I'm not telling you disappointment and physical harm will never 
visit you, I'm saying you don't have to spend a lifetime eternalizing 
those feelings associated with such experiences. The healthier 
approach would be to have your moment of pity then move on, don't 
exist permanently as a victim. To remain as a victim is to sacrifice 
those very things you want for yourself like joy, abundance, lasting 
friendships, and closer family relationships. Also remember, we don't 
have to give in to those feelings of hurt if we don't want to, our feelings 
are our responsibility. So I ask you, which is more important to 
you, freedom from energy and prosperity robbing hurts or lifelong 
embitterment?</P>
