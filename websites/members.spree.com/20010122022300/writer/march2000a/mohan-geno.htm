<P align=justify>
The twentieth century has witnessed the intermingling of races in an unprecedented manner.  Significant advances in the fields of transportation and communication have enabled us to transcend the former formidable topographical barriers of yesteryears and coexist as a global village.  The commingling of ideas, languages and people, in particular, has never been so pronounced as it has been in this century.  We have experienced radical advances in medicine, science and technology that has ensured a longer life span for humans, an explosive growth in the human population, and a proliferation of material comforts.  Concurrently, we have witnessed a corresponding decline in the spiritual and social fabric culminating in an unfortunate emphasis on intolerance, personal space, self-indulgence and self-aggrandizement.  The much-reviled concept of German imperialism called Lebensraum (the living space) is a reality in diverse corners of the globe, as we bring this century to a close.  The notion of insufficient personal space and intolerance for others has resulted in numerous ghastly acts of ethnic cleansing in recent years.  Additionally, it has set the stage for violent confrontations in the new millennium. 
<P align=justify>
History is a timeless archive, a bittersweet memory of our checkered co-existence, and, most importantly, a reminder of the forgotten follies of mankind.  The lessons, if truly comprehended, provide incisive indicators, to harmonize our cohabitation, to recognize and possibly pre-empt similar tragedies in mankind's current and future lives.  This article postulates a recipe for the occurrence of genocide.  The methodology is based on the evaluation of numerous instances of genocide that have marred our existence in the twentieth century. It presents the essential ingredients that could help us predict and identify these hot spots in order to foil such massive human catastrophes in the next millennium.
<BR><BR>
<B>Genocide in the Twentieth Century</B>
<P align=justify>
Despite all of the scientific, technological, and the dubious, oft-touted cultural advances by mankind, the blood-spattered arena of genocide remains barbaric as ever.  There were numerous instances of mass decimation of select human domains perpetrated by other humans during this century.  All of these were equally grisly in substance, and abhorrent in their intent; for, in my opinion, killing a human being on the basis of his race, color or creed is the most despicable of all crimes.  However, for the sake of brevity, I will limit my discussion to the ones that were the most gruesome; in terms of the methods and the number of victims. This makes the selection at par with the guidelines currently prevalent in our media; where the sensational scale of a crime is directly proportional to the number of victims it consumes.  This will also bring to light the fact that these acts were perpetrated in diverse geographical locations, reaffirming that no community is immune to this potential carnage of a marauding genocide.  

<P align=justify>The major genocide of the twentieth century that were utilized in this study are listed below:

<li> The slaughter of Armenians in Turkey
<li> Stalin's genocide of the Ukrainians 
<li> The decimation of Jews and other minorities by Hitler in Nazi Germany
<li> The massacre of Tibetans by China under the leadership of Mao
<li> Pol Pot's reign of terror in Cambodia
<li> The extermination of ethnic Tamils by the so-called "Aryan Sinhala" majority in Sri Lanka
<li> The ethnic cleansing in the Balkans
<li> The widespread massacre of the Tutsies in Rwanda

<P align=justify>In all of the above cases, the execution of genocide required perpetrator(s), the receivers, and almost always a multitude of onlookers.  Although all these incidents appear seemingly irrational on the surface, there did exist a common theme, a constant undercurrent prior to, and during the course of these episodes.  First, none of these were accidents.  These were all meticulously planned and carefully orchestrated campaigns of mass execution.  Secondly, in most of the above cases, some brilliant despot, later deemed as a madman by posterity, engineered the slaughter.  In each case this dictator succeeded in galvanizing the entire nation, terrorizing it and/or gaining its passive acceptance to the widespread atrocities inflicted on the minorities.  Lastly, and most importantly, all these diabolical acts in large measure, had the tacit acquiescence or feigned ignorance of the majority of the population.

<P align=justify>There is a plethora of manuscripts that describe in great length this human carnage, the concentration camps, the atrocities and the campaign of terror unleashed by these dictatorial regimes in various parts of the world.  What is, however, of greater relevance and remains largely overlooked, is a good psycho-social profile of the oppressor(s), the oppressed and the silent majority that were witness to these morbid sagas unfolding right before their very eyes.
<BR><BR>
<B>Recipe for Genocide</B>
<P align=justify>
If the saying "history repeats itself" is true, are we as mankind doomed to suffer repeated onslaughts of genocide's debilitating fury?  In the fifty years since the closure of the Nazi annals, we have experienced carnage on a genocidal scale in numerous countries of Asia, Africa, Europe, and South America.  Can we, as nature's premiere perceptive and intellectual species pre-empt similar incidents from happening in the next millennia?  Can we foretell from the signs and subsequently impose enough checks and balances to prevent such a tragedy in the future?  That, time alone will tell.  For now, we can only analyze to help elicit the telltale tangibles, the signs that could forebode the coming of evil.

<P align=justify>Regardless of the above axiomatic truth, I for one, think that a number of these tragedies can and should be avoided, given all the means at our disposal. Based on a study of the social, political, economic, religious, and ethnic factors prevalent in the target countries, the tangibles can be evaluated, assessed and subsequently monitored to preclude such tragedies in the future. The following postulates the factors for a potential working model that could help us predict and identify the hot spots and then assist us in estimating the potential timing of these events.  The factors and their interplay as discussed here are based on preliminary research performed while investigating some of the major genocide inflicted on humanity in the twentieth century.

<P align=justify>The predictive model to determine the onset of genocide should be based on the following key variables:
<BR><BR>
1. The Rate of Economic Decline
<BR>2. The Ethnic Index
<BR>3. Psyche of the Masses
<BR>4. The Leadership Index


<BR><BR>
<B>The Rate of Economic Decline</B>
<P align=justify>
The first factor is based on the "material".  This materialism has varying connotations in varying locations of our world.  While materialism would signify "affluence" in the developed world, it plainly indicates "food, clothing, and shelter" in the language of the Third World.  The key here is the "rate" of economic decline.  This is an objective, quantifiable indicator that provides the first major sign of a population that is largely discontent.  The drop in the per capita income of the target population should be determined both on a yearly and on a total cumulative basis.  Ground zero, or the baseline, can be set at the preceding five years.   The yearly rate analysis is instrumental in eliciting the declining trend in the standard of living of the target population.  However, it is the cumulative trend over a relatively extended period that essentially fortifies the analysis and establishes that the deterioration is near permanent.   In this time span, the economic drop has ensconced fairly substantially into the psyche of the erstwhile thriving masses.   The reasons for the economic nosedive could be numerous; like a combination of a floundering economy, burgeoning population growth rate, social denigration and/or complacency of the population in the face of affluence or downright despair when confronted by abject poverty.  We now have a situation where the population is undergoing a continual decline in their standard of living and in order to achieve the halcyon days of not so distant a past, is looking for easy "scapegoats". Given the current global climate of shirking responsibilities and quick fix, it is highly unlikely that the discontent population would assume responsibility for their own plight and endeavor to ameliorate it.  Hence, the majority embarks on the search for the "responsible" population fraction.  
<BR><BR>
<B>The Ethnic Index</B>
<P align=justify>
The Ethnic Index comes into prominence in light of the various ethnic "melting pots" that are now visible globally in diverse geographic locations.  In all these locations there is a singular concordant theme of "unity in diversity" that has, through the centuries, kept the social fabric together.  This "unity" is the first cohesive trait that disappears from within the community with the onslaught of economic hardships.  It is supplanted by a continuing pattern of divisive and partisan interests.  The net result is a diverse ethnic community that is now transmogrified into the quagmire of communal discord and ethnic hatred.  As pointed out earlier, this century is replete with numerous instances of coexisting races turning militant and inflicting atrocities on each other.  The current ethnic climate in a particular country can be best evaluated based on the number of distinct minorities and the economic and/or social state of these minorities.  This Ethnic Index becomes important and pronounced with each of the following divisions that sets the minority apart from the majority:
<BR>
 <li>Race
<li> Color 
<li> Religion 

<P align=justify>Once this division has been established into the realm of the conscious or the sub-conscious it is only a matter of time before the conflagration manifests.   The timing is dictated by the rate of economic decline but the presence of any of the above three factors signifies seeds of ethnic discord.  The final element of the Ethnic Index is an assessment of the economic status of the minorities' vis-à-vis the majority.  In this regard, both affluence and poverty influences the Ethnic Index.  While affluence of a minority is viewed as parochial indulgence, poverty of the minorities is construed as a drain on the majority.  With the onset of an economic decline, each of the above parameters contributes singularly to this problem of ethnic polarization. When these occur collectively in a society, the crisis is compounded.  The Ethnic Index is central to this analysis for the prediction of ethnic strife. 
<BR>
<BR><B>Psyche of the Masses</B>
<P align=justify>
Implementation of human carnage in a particular society is contingent on the "psyche of the masses".  The predisposition and the prevalent temperament of the majority towards the issue of ethnicity in general and the minorities in particular decide the occurrence and onset of genocide.  Regardless of how it may appear to the rest of the world, it is rarely ever the exclusive work of a bloodthirsty tyrant.  Ethnic cleansing of the minority does inevitably require either passive acquiescence or active concurrence from the majority faction of the population.  Some critical parameters that need analysis are:

<li> Religion of the majority 
<LI> Superiority/inferiority by race or color
<LI> History of strife
<LI> Density of population
<LI> Overall temperament

<P align=justify>Religion is the dominant factor when we discuss the likelihood of genocide unleashed by the majority.  It has the power to bond the majority together in a superfluously spiritual and outwardly holy campaign to cleanse their realm of the irreverent heretics.  This religious fervor is fanned by devious despots and is always site-specific.  The most benign of religions can assume the most bellicose of forms in a particular location.  It can galvanize the population to commit ghastly atrocities on their former neighbors or erstwhile friends.  A religious rift between the majority and the minority eventually gravitates towards a climactic genocidal eruption.  

<P align=justify>The superiority or inferiority complex is something that is ingrained owing to centuries of racial chauvinism directed either at the minority or in some instance at the majority.  This ultimately finds a violent outlet for retribution when the majority feels deprived and the numbers are on their side.  

<P align=justify>A population that has by and large gone through a long tainted history of racial strife is prone to indulge in acts of belligerence than one that has peacefully co-existed through the centuries.  In such communities, ethnic cleansing may be a recurrent theme varying in scale and intensity with each generation.  Once the majority population is hardened by these repeated acts of vendetta and aggression, it is more apt to launch such carnage on a larger scale with relatively less remorse.  

<P align=justify>The density of population is an important indicator of the attitude of the majority.  An ever-burgeoning rise in the population not only decreases the living space per person in the country but also imposes limits on the use of its resources for an individual.  Basic items that are essential for existence like food, clothing, and shelter become luxuries in these situations setting the stage for violent confrontations for their accrual.  Widespread starvation and depleting essential resources can obfuscate the judgement and test the tolerance of even the most magnanimous population.  At a certain point, called the "elastic limit", there is irreparable fracture of the society.  Ethnic feuds initiate and subsequently escalate.  

<P align=justify>The overall disposition of the majority can be assessed on numerous fronts; religion, culture, lifestyle, eating habits, behavior and attitudes.  A religion that is passive and a culture that is assimilating would be more forgiving of the minorities despite the obvious differences.  A society that is largely intolerant and fixated on its Lebensraum or living space would be averse to intrusions.  Attitudes that are primarily pugnacious and lifestyles that extol blood, gore, and cruelty on animals are more likely to tread a path of violence when faced a confrontation with supposedly dissimilar humans.  Conversely, a population that is largely peaceful and innately spiritual is more likely to come to terms amicably with a similar situation.   
<BR>
<BR><B>The Leadership Index</B>

<P align=justify>The first three variables, if aptly characterized and duly quantified, will provide the location of the potential areas around the world.  The point to note here is that the Leadership Index, although immensely crucial, and perhaps, of primary importance for the genocide to actually happen, has been placed last in this hierarchy of variables. This is because it is hard to truly quantify and when it is obvious, it is usually too late to avert a humanitarian disaster.  This variable is essentially an intangible.  It is based on an individual's personality that is hard to dissect prior to its actual manifestation. This elusive variable usually surfaces at the very end, after the first three factors are well entrenched; the result at that point is fairly obvious and does not really need any prediction.  However, notwithstanding the intangibles, the correlation of the tangibles, should provide a fairly accurate estimate of the probability of the carnage happening in the identified trouble spots. 
<BR><BR>
<B>Conclusion</B>
<P align=justify>
A predictive, positive correlation between these fairly quantitative factors can aid the peacekeepers, the leaders, and our global community, to know about these potential hot spots in the world, where this calamity could be a future genocidal reality. The global referees of our age, like the United Nations, can then take the appropriate action; economic sanction, military action, or a combination thereof, to pre-empt occurrence of another genocide. 

<P align=justify>I firmly believe that the ultimate solution in this war against genocide is predicated on prediction and successful pre-emptive prevarication.  The warning signs are always there; millions of innocent human lives can be saved, if humanity is more aware of these indicators.

<P align=justify>The diabolical acts of ethnic cleansing and genocide inflicted on millions during the course of this century, provides a number of important lessons for our generation.  The foremost amongst them is to avoid similar future tragedies during the impending millennium.  The massacre of millions of innocent humans in order to quench the blood thirst of a megalomaniac, or the hatred of a community, shall no longer be a mere reflection on the ineptitude of the localized masses.  In this global village of the next millennium, this will and should rightfully be construed as passive acceptance by the rest of mankind. 

<P align=justify>In the final analysis, it is our responsibility, as global citizens of the next millennium, to avert such disasters in the future.  A strong public opinion based on empathy for diversity, and an atmosphere of censorship against ethnic persecution, is the most effective method to counteract such menace and pre-empt future human tragedies.
