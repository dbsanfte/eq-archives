<P>	It started out just like any other day. David boarded his
treasured sailboat and headed out of the harbor for a day of
sailing. As he passed the faithful lighthouse on his way out
to the open ocean, his heart began to dance over the feeling
of freedom that came with a day on the ocean. He knew it would
be a great day.
</P>
<P>After several hours of sailing a few miles offshore, David 
began to sense a change in the air. He'd always been good at
sensing an oncoming storm. He decided to start heading back to
the safety of his harbor. He searched for his compass to get an
idea of which direction lie the shore. The compass was nowhere
to be found. A little concerned, David then referred to the 
navigational instruments of the sailboat. That was no help as
he neglected to get them repaired after they stopped working a
few months back.
</P>
<P>As the sky darkened and a dense fog set in, David's concern 
grew to nearly a panic level. He was lost at sea. He had 
ventured out of site of the shoreline, had lost his compass and
his navigational instruments were broken. The sea began to roll,
tossing David and his tiny sailboat about like a cork. What 
would he do now, he wondered. How would he ever make it back to
his safe harbor.</P>
<P>
Suddenly, David remembed the lighthouse that marked the entrance
to the harbor. Although he had no idea what direction it lie,
David turned his boat toward a direction that just felt right
and true. As he continued in blind faith, he peered out at the
dense fog, searching for the trusty lighthouse.</P>

<P>Off in the distance, he heard a bell that sat atop a bouy 
marking the entrance to his harbor. He then saw a light, at first 
very small and dim, but which grew brighter as he moved toward 
it. In a few more minutes the light grew very bright as David's
lighthouse emerged from the fog, bringing with it direction, 
clarity, safety and comfort. David was home. He was safe.</P>

<P>Sometimes our lives seem very similar to David's day on the 
ocean. Everything starts out pretty normal and fun. Then the 
weather changes and the fog sets in. Perhaps it comes in the 
form of a relationship problem, a crisis at work, financial
concerns or a health problem. You look for direction and 
guidance but can't seem to find your own internal compass. You
are lost and being tossed about on the sea of life.</P>
<P>
Suddenly, you remember you have your own trusty guiding light.
Maybe it's your personal mission statement, your relationship
with a Higher Power or - in my case - my Life Purpose. In blind 
faith, you turn in the direction that feels right and true. You 
proceed through the fog, searching for an answer. The light, at
first very dim, begins to brighten. Eventually, it emerges from
the darkness bringing with it clarity, direction, safety and
comfort. You are home.</P>

<P>Spend this week inspecting your own navigational instruments. 
Check to make sure you have your own compass ready for when the
fog of life sets in. Ask yourself what it is that gives you 
guidance and clarity. Do you have your own personal mission
statement, Life Purpose or relationship with a Higher Power? If
so, can you see it from where you are? If not, do you know in 
which direction it lie?  Write your thoughts down on paper or 
in a journal. If your guiding light is not visible to you, make
a plan to clarify it. Talk to a close friend, a Coach or your 
Pastor. We all need our own lighthouse for navigating the sea 
of life.</P>

<P>Have a great week. Send me an email and tell me what your 
guiding light looks like.</P>

<P>It's your life.  Create it the way you desire!</P>
