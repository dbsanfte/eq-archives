<P>	Publishing an ezine isn't hard but be prepared to work at
it.  To have a quality ezine you need to spend time on each
issue.  Don't throw the issue together at the last moment.</P>

<P>You may want to consider sending your issue out on a
Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday.  A lot of ezines go out on
Mondays and Fridays.</p>

<P>Try not to have your ezine too long.  If your ezine is
really long then you may want to send it out in two parts.
Depending on the email client after the message gets so long
it gets turned into an attachment.  Some people won't open
attachments and some people don't know how to open
attachments.</P>
<P>
Once you have a format for your ezine stick to it.  Don't
keep changing it.  Change for the better every now and then
is o.k.  If you've received feedback from subscribers saying
they want more in the ezine, consider it depending how many
subscribers have mentioned it.  After all, you want to make
your subscribers happy.</P>

<P>Make sure your ezine is formatted between 55 and 65
characters.  Stick to one number don't keep changing it.</P>

<P>You may want to offer some freebies or some kind of
incentive for subscribing to your ezine.  Here is an example
for you.  My subscribers can have access to a private
archives that I set up along with some freebies.  The
private archives is targeted to my ezine.  My marketing
ezine has the private archive a marketing resources and info
and my ezine that talks about ezine publishing has a private
archives of ezine templates and resources for ezine
publishers.</P>

<P>Try to offer something to your subscribers that no one else
offers and they can't get somewhere else or at least get
easily.</P>

<P>Make a template of your ezine and save it to your hard drive
or a floppy.  Be sure to include all the information that
stays the same such as the header, contact information and
subscribe/unsubscribe directions.  That way all you have to
do is open the template and insert your information.  This
is a time saver.</P>

<P>If you put ads in your ezine or print articles from other
people then copy and paste.  Don't retype them.</P>

<P>Ask for feedback.  If you don't want to do it in every issue
then do it every two to three issues.  If you don't receive
any feedback don't be alarmed.  If no one says anything then
you can assume all is well.  People are quick to criticize.</P>

<P>When receiving bad feedback, some may be used to your
advantage.  If a high number of your subscribers give you
bad feedback on the same feedback then you should consider
making some changes.  After all you want to please your
subscribers.</P>

<P>Remember you can't please everybody all of the time.  It's
impossible.  Try your best though that's all anybody can ask
of you.</P>

<P>Use these hints.  You will find them helpful.  However, do
not expect miracles and remember everything takes time so
you may not see changes right away.</P>
