	<P>No matter how controversial your book cover is, no matter how strange the topic of your book is, no matter how similar your book is to the thousands out there, yours could be another book.  Yes, I say this with all conviction.  I am not saying this for you to feel better.
</P>


<P>Let me share this experience with you.  <U><I>Magic of Numbers</I></U> is my first published book in this country.  <I><U>Magic of Numbers</U></I> was listed in Books in Print as  <U><I>The Magic of Numbers</I></U>.  In a subsequent edition, as a part of an effort to improve on the first edition, the title was changed to just <U><I>Magic of Numbers</I></U>.
</P>
<P>A similar title was also listed as <U><I>The Magic of Numbers</I></U> by a different author and a different publisher.  Immediately, a thought that someone had copyrighted my book ran through my mind, though a very remarkable difference exist between the two books.  Mine has a little over 170 pages while the title in question has over 400 pages.
</P>


<P>On November 5, 1994, I wrote to a professional organization requesting that they review my book.  Their reply reads as follows:
</P>


<P>In response to your letter of 5 November.  If your book is <I><U>The Magic of Numbers</U></I>, by Bell, we published a review in 1992.  If it is different and the publication date is 1993 or later, then we would be interested in reviewing it.
</P>


<P>The book was submitted and it was reviewed in the October 1995 issue of Mathematics Teacher, a publication of National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.</a>  Obviously, the two books are not the same.  You have to remember that titles are not copyrightable.  What did we learn from this experience?  No matter how similar in title, two books are, they are not necessarily the same in content.
</P>


<P>What kind of book do want to write?  Summarize this in a sentence in the form of an affirmation e.g. "I am someone with ideas.  I want to write a book on......"  Then repeat this to yourself before you retire for the night and as soon as you wake up in the morning.
</P>


<P>No matter what the New York Giants are saying to you, yours could be another book.
</P>
<P>No matter what your friends are saying to you, yours could be another book.
</P>
<P>No matter what the bookstore managers are saying to you, yours could be another book.
</P>
<P>No matter what your editor is saying to you, yours could be another book.
</P>


<P>"Why did you bring out another book on self-publishing when there are already so many out there"?  a bookstore manager in California asked me.
</P>
<P>I told him that the primary objective of my book is to inspire and to motivate people to write and publish their own literary works.  IF I can do it, someone out there can do the same.  My book is inspirational.  It is also motivational.  It is approaching self-publishing from a fresh perspective.  It is addressing self-publishing from an angle quite different from what people have been used to.
</P>


<P>The American people are losing faith in the US Criminal Justice System.  According to a recent poll commissioned by the American Bar Association in April 1995, 44% of Americans are losing faith in the criminal justice system of this great country.  Just like the American people, some writers and aspiring writers are losing faith in the verdict of the New York Giants.  No polls known to me have been conducted on the verdict of these Giants.  The result of such polls as you already know will not be surprising.  Do we really need polls to draw our conclusion?  Let your rejection slips be your witness.
</P>


<P>Whether your interest is fiction, non-fiction, poetry, screenplay, etc. yours could be another book.
</P>


<P>Losing faith in the Giants has resulted to proliferation of self-publishers.  Proliferation of self-publishers has resulted to more books in library and bookstore bookshelves.
</P>
<P>Losing faith in the Giants has resulted to people creating opportunities for themselves thereby making lemon out of lemonade.
</P>
<P>Losing faith in the Giants has resulted to people being creative, and believing in their own ideas and making things happen in the process of doing so.
</P>
<P>Losing faith in the Giants has resulted to increase in employment - employment in companies taking care of the needs and interests of the small and independent publisher.
</P>
<P>Losing faith in the Giants has resulted to people taking control of their own destiny.
</P>
<P>Losing faith in the Giants has resulted to people taking risks.  We are talking of people risking their own lives, their money, their time and other resources.
</P>

<P>
Your book could be written out of personal experience.  Are you doing business in South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Eastern Europe?  People are anxious to know how these people do business.  People are anxious to learn about business opportunities in these areas.  Write that book for yours could be another book. 
</P>


<P>Do you know that:</P>



<P><U><I>I Want To Tell You</I></U> by O.J. Simpson
</P>
<P><I><U>Now, You Know</U></I> by Mrs. Beatrice Dukakis
</P>
<P><U><I>Maggi's American Dream:</I></U>  The Life of a black Family by Dr. James P. Comer
</P>
<P><I><U>Succeeding Against The Odds</U></I> by Johnson & Johnson were all written out of personal experience?
</P>


<P>Writing from experience is not confined only to the old.</P>

<P>The young can also write from experience.</P>  

<P>Don't wait till you are nineteen years of age.  
</P>
<P>Don't wait till you are 40 or 65.  When you reach 40 or 65, there might not be any ideas to communicate.
</P>


<P>Look at more cases of people writing out of personal experience.  Professor Anita Hill, the University of Oklahoma Law professor has written two books following her testimony against the Supreme Court nominee, Clarence Thomas.
</P>


<P>The information industry is creating opportunities for those who are able to recognize as well as seize these opportunities.  Look at the internet, the information superhighway.  Many people out there are still operating within the confines of their comfort zones-working with typewriters, dedicated word processors and so on.  Many have embraced this new technology, and many are anxious to embrace it and still many are not aware of the possibilities of this new technology.  There is a need for these people to go beyond their comfort zones.  There is also a need for awareness.  To achieve both objectives, books are being written and books will continue to be written.  More books are still needed.  Write that book, yours could be another book.
</P>
<P>Write it now for yours could be another book.</P>

<P>I am talking about a book that cannot be prevented by any excuses.
</P>


<P>Lack of ideas cannot prevent it.  You have ideas if you can stop for me minute and look within.
</P>


<P>Being unpopular cannot stop it.</P>

<P>Alice Walker was once unpopular.</P> 
<P>
Once upon a time, Terry McMillan was unpopular.</P>  
<P>
Once upon a time, Zig Ziglar was unpopular.</P>
<P>
Once upon a time, Louis Armour was unpopular.</P>
<P>
Once upon a time, Daniel Steele was unpopular.
</P>


<P>Whose approval are you waiting for before you commit to your ideas on paper? Your parents', your friends', you boss', your sister's, your brother's etc.  Please don't.  Write that book, for yours could be another book.
</P>


<P>The American society is infested with drugs and alcohol problems, teen pregnancy, domestic and youth violence etc.  The schools, the churches, mosques, non-profit organizations, and individuals are searching fro answers.  They are busy looking for solutions in books, and programs, etc.  Yours could be a book they have all been waiting for.  Write that book for yours could be another book.
</P>


<P>Quite like any other project, writing a book is also a project.  "But I am too old to commit my time and resources to writing a book."
</P>
<P>No, let nothing stand against your dream of writing a book.  Napoleon Hill and H. Clement Stone co-authored a book titled, "Success Through A Positive Mental Attitude" when Hill was 77 years old.  The same year, (Hill) delivered lectures in both Australia and New Zealand.  In 1967, at the age of 84, Hill wrote Grow Rich With Peace of Mind.  In addition, as if these were not enough, at the age of 88, Hill's other books, "Succeed and Grow Rich Through Persuasion" and You Can Work Your Own Miracles were published.  Isaac Newton remained hardworking till he was almost 85 years of age.  John Wesley was engrossed with preaching, guiding and directing Methodism at the age of 88.  What's my point here?  We are talking about a book that cannot be prevented by age.  Age becomes a barrier only if you allow it as long as you are healthy.
</P>


<P>Writing a book is a goal and for some of us it is a life-time ambition.  If writing a book is goal, then, Dr. Robert Schuller, the pastor of Crystal Cathedral, Garden Groove, California has this to tell us here.  "No matter how near death you are, no matter how near death you spouse is, you still have to set goals.
</P>


<P>What happens when you set goals?  When you set goals you face challenges.  When you face challenges, you discover your hidden potentials.  By using them you can transform your dreams into physical reality. 
</P>
