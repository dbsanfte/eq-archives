	<P>My name is Talbot.  I manage a Hospital in London.
</P>
<P>You know, doctors and nurses, heroism and romance, the bleeding patient rescued from certain death by the care and dedication of the well organised hospital team.
</P>
<P>It's not always like that, I promise.
</P>
<P>Let me tell you about Mrs Prentice.
</P>
<P>I had only just arrived at the hospital after battling the usual commuter traffic, when I took the call from Mrs Prentice.   "Good morning, Mrs Prentice.  How can I help?  I'm the Hospital Manager, and my name is Talbot."
</P>
<P>She had a slow, deliberate way of speaking, to compensate for a rolling, rough Eastern European accent.  An elderly lady, but very sharp.  "I don't know if you can help me Mr. Talbot, but I have a problem.  You see I was a patient in your Hospital last year and had a cataract operation done by Mr. Adel."
</P>
<P>I knew Bill Adel well; he was one of the best Ophthalmologists in the Hospital.
</P>
<P>Mrs Prentice went on.  "Well I have now been to two other surgeons, and to Moorfields Eye Hospital and they say there is nothing that can be done for me.  But I wonder what you think.  Can you help me?"
</P>
<P>"Did something happen to you during the operation Mrs Prentice?"
</P>
<P>"No, no.  Mr Adel was very kind and I know he did his best.  I am not suggesting that he did anything wrong.  But you see my vision is not as good as it was before and I am told that there is nothing that can be done about it."
</P>
<P>"If you've seen a number of doctors and they all give you the same advice Mrs Prentice, then I don't think I can add any more."  I was trying to be helpful.
</P>
<P>"But surely there is something that can be done?"  She was pleasant but persistent.  "There must be something the Hospital can do for me.  It's not right that I should have this problem."
</P>
<P>I needed time.  "All I can suggest Mrs Prentice, is that you put your problem to me in a letter and I promise I will investigate the matter and get back to you promptly."
</P>


<P>The letter arrived within the week:
</P>


<P>Dear Mr Talbot,</P>

<P>Thank you for taking the time to talk to me on the phone earlier this week.  I want to stress that I am very happy with the treatment I received from Mr Adel and the Hospital last year.  Mr Adel is a very kind man and I know he has helped many of my friends to get better sight.

As I told you, Mr Adel referred me to a colleague of his who confirmed that there is no further operation that can be done to improve my present situation.  I've also visited Moorfields Eye Hospital and I saw another ophthalmologist there who said the same thing.  But you see my eye is definitely a lot worse than it was before the operation and there must be something that you can do to help me.

Please let me have your answer as soon as possible.
</P>
	<P>Yours sincerely,</P>


	<P>Mrs. B Prentice</P>





<P>In her polite way I knew that she was suggesting that she was entitled to some kind of compensation.
</P>
<P>I asked Mary Pepper, the Matron to look into the clinical facts for me, and she arranged to see me at the end of Friday.  She had looked at the medical notes, talked to Bill Adel and his Anaesthetist, and most of the nurses involved in Mrs Prentice's care.
</P>
<P>
We sat together in her office and I listened, admiring her professional approach.  "Mrs Prentice is a 55 year old widow who was referred to Mr Adel for assessment in January, last year.  Mr Adel had done her left eye the year before and she was pleased with the result."
</P>
<P>"Mr Adel decided he could make an improvement to her right eye and booked her in for a Cataract a few weeks later.  As far as her notes are concerned everything went well.  Certainly there was nothing unusual before or during the op.  She wanted a general anaesthetic because she had the other eye done under local and felt a bit uncomfortable about that.  She was intubated without fuss, and the op lasted just over an hour.  She recovered well in Theatre and was transferred back to the ward quickly."
</P>
<P>"She was an inpatient for three days, which is a bit longer than I would expect, but she had a couple of minor fainting spells and Mr Adel decided to bring in Burlap, the Consultant Physician just to check that she was all right.  He found nothing amiss and after those extra 48 hours, she was discharged home."
</P>
<P> "At the follow up consultation, poor Mrs Prentice complained that the sight in her right eye was worse than before the op.   Adel referred her to Arbuthnott, the Ophthalmologist, for a second opinion.  Arbuthnott confirmed that she had suffered a small tear to the rear lining of the orbit of the eye and that it could not be repaired.  Her sight would not improve.  He could not see how that injury could possibly be connected to the surgery."
</P>
<P>I interrupted her.  "What is the extent of the deterioration in her sight?"
</P>
<P>"She suffers from tunnel vision in her right eye and it seems to be getting worse.  She can get by because her left eye is now good enough to compensate."  Mary went on, "she went to another specialist at Moorfields herself and although we do not have a copy of his report, it would appear that his view is the same as Adel and Arbuthnott."
</P>
<P>"What does Bill Adel think caused the tear?"
</P>
<P>Mary was quick to answer.  "I asked him that.  He doesn't know.  Just one of those things.   He thinks the injury was about to happen and something triggered it."
</P>
<P>"No fault of ours?"
</P>
<P>"Not that I can see."
</P>
<P>I wanted more reassurance. "Did you talk to our staff on the Ward and in Theatre?"
</P>
<P>She looked at the file in front of her for just a moment and then replied.  "Jan talked to her staff who were assisting in the Theatre at the time.  Everything was normal.  No hint of a problem.  Mr Adel can sometimes be a bit slow, but nothing wrong in that."
</P>
<P>"The Ward staff were reasonably happy, apart from Mrs Prentice's fainting spells, but they put that down to the anaesthetic and she seemed none the worse."
</P>
<P>"So Mary, what do you think?  Do you see anything here to worry about?  Are you sure that the faints have nothing to do with it?"
</P>
<P>Mary gave her opinion without hesitation.  "I can't see how the fainting spells could be relevant and Bill Adel thinks the same.  Obviously something happened to her eye while she was in our care but it was just unfortunate and would probably have happened in any case."
</P>


<P>It wasn't easy to put together a letter that would satisfy Mrs Prentice.  It took me some time.
</P>
<P>Dear Mrs Prentice,
</P>
<P>Thank you for your letter concerning your operation for removal of a Cataract at this Hospital last January.  I'm sorry the result of the operation was not satisfactory.
</P>
<P>We have conducted a thorough investigation of the events surrounding your treatment at the Hospital and cannot identify any untoward incidents that might have contributed to the poor vision in your right eye.  The operation went smoothly, and although you suffered a number of minor fainting spells in the ward afterwards, Dr Burlap, the Consultant Physician, saw you and confirmed that there was no ongoing problem.
</P>
<P>I have concluded that your treatment was carried out to our normal high standards.  The outcome was not as we would have wished but I'm afraid the outcome can never be guaranteed.  In your case it would appear that you were unlucky in suffering a poor outcome involving a small tear to the back of your eye which could have happened at any time before or after your hospital stay.
</P>
<P>Please accept my good wishes and do not hesitate to phone me if you wish to discuss this matter further.
</P>
<P>Yours sincerely,
</P>


<P>She phoned.  "Mr Talbot, thank you for your letter, but I am still not happy.  Can I come and see you?"  She sounded very businesslike.  Quite calm.
</P>
<P>"Yes of course, Mrs Prentice."
</P>
<P>When I met her some days later I was impressed by her.  She was accompanied by her daughter Louise.  Mrs Prentice was well groomed; hair brushed back and held just off the shoulder, creamy blonde.  She wore no glasses and there was no visible sign of injury to her right eye which, like its partner was clear and blue.  Her face was lined, but not sagging and her full mouth was emphasised in a pale, modest red to enhance a warm smile.
</P>
<P>Her clothes were practical and not ostentatious, and her manner was pleasant and to a purpose, she showed no sign of nervousness.  Her daughter on the other hand was less composed and I could tell from the first handshake that her anger or nervousness might lead to aggression.
</P>
<P>Mrs Prentice started the conversation as soon as she was seated.  "Thank you for seeing us Mr Talbot.  You see I'm not at all happy with your letter."
</P>
<P>"I'm sorry you feel that way Mrs Prentice.  I'll do my best to help again now that you're here."
</P>
<P>She started to say something but stumbled on one word and Louise jumped in quickly.  "My mother has been to a number of Specialists and they all say the same.  The sight in her right eye will not get any better."
</P>
<P>But Mrs Prentice would not let her daughter take control of her story and interrupted.  "They tell me Mr Talbot, that my right eye will get worse and worse.  Thank God my other eye is okay."
</P>
<P>She went on with confidence and poise.  "You see my eye was fine before I came into this Hospital.  I was not seeing blues and browns very well, the colours were faded, just like my other eye used to be, but I could see all around me.  When I had that cataract done in my left eye, it was a great improvement and I thought the same would happen with my other eye.  But it's much much worse.  I can't get around by myself very easily.  I have to rely on one eye only."
</P>
<P>"I came into this Hospital with reasonable sight and left worse.  That can't be right.  There must be something you can do?"
</P>
<P>I started to say,  "I am not a doctor, but it would seem that the Ophthalmologists you have seen are all agreed that there is nothing that can be done.  I don't think I................."
</P>
<P>Louise boiled over.  "But my mother suffered an injury while she was in this Hospital!  That can't be right.  Somebody must be responsible!"  She was not shouting, but her words were sharp and pointed, sent like arrows towards me, daring me to disagree.
</P>
<P>"Yes, it would seem that your mother did suffer an injury at about the time of the operation here, but we have looked into this very thoroughly and we see no explanation during her time in hospital for the injury and nothing that went wrong during the operation."
</P>
<P>Louise again.  "How can you say that?  How can you say that nothing went wrong, when she came in with good eyesight and left with no sight in one eye?"
</P>
<P>I had to admit that it was a difficult question.  "I'm not saying that your mother did not suffer an injury, but only that neither the Hospital nor the surgeon concerned were the cause of that injury."
</P>
<P>Mrs Prentice then said,  "Well who was responsible then?"
</P>
<P>"In this case I believe that no one was responsible."
</P>
<P>She was back in flash.  "How could no one be responsible for a serious injury?"
</P>
<P>I felt genuine sympathy.  "I'm very sorry Mrs Prentice that you have ended up with a poor result from the operation when you were hoping for something much better."
</P>
<P>She interrupted again.  "Sorry isn't much use to me.  Do you think it's enough?"
</P>
<P>"No, but I'm afraid hospitals cannot guarantee success in every case.  Sometimes things go wrong and it's nobody's fault.  And sometimes patients end up in a worse position.  Your surgeon should have explained the risks at the beginning."
</P>
<P>"He didn't.  If I had known about this risk I would never have gone ahead with the operation."
</P>
<P>I tried to be constructive.  "I'm sure he would have told you about the anaesthetic risk....."
</P>
<P>"Yes, yes I know that general anaesthetics are dangerous, but if I had been told about this."
</P>
<P>Perhaps Bill Adel didn't tell her, or perhaps she did not listen.  It didn't much matter.  
</P>
<P>The meeting ended unsatisfactorily for both sides.  I advised that she might consider taking legal advice, which she complained, was costly.   Sometimes things have to end this way I thought.
</P>
<P>I thought about Mrs Prentice on the way home.  Nobody's fault, just one of those things, as I told her.
</P>

<P>That night I was contacted by Bill Adel.  "I'm sorry you were bothered with having to meet Mrs Prentice.  How did it go?"  It was most unusual for any of the Consultants to make contact out of normal hours. 
</P>
<P>"I wasn't able to satisfy her, I think she wanted compensation.  But I feel on this occasion that there are no grounds for payment.  She suffered an injury probably while she was under our care, but I can't see that it was our fault."
</P>
<P>"Yes, I agree.  I'm sure now that those fainting spells had something to do with it.  It might have caused a loss of circulation to part of the eye that was weak already and that precipitated the tear."
</P>
<P>I frowned inwardly.  This was a slightly different story than the one he had told Mary earlier.  It didn't seem to alter the fact that we had not been responsible for the injury, but it did seem to put the injury firmly into the time frame of her hospital stay.  
</P>


<P>I never heard more from Mrs Prentice and I assumed that she had decided not to go to a solicitor.  
</P>
<P>However some years later I had the opportunity to ask Bill Adel again about the incident.  Like most surgeons he was able to recall the interesting cases from his memory bank and the patient's name came up as well on this occasion.  He remembered that the case was not straightforward.
</P>
<P>"It was tricky eye that one.  Thank God we got away with it."
</P>
<P>"Yes, but I don't think there was much of a case Bill, if it was the fainting spells that caused the damage, we could not be held responsible for that."
</P>
<P>"But it wasn't."
</P>
<P>He pondered whether or not to say more. 
</P>
<P>He went on.  "I was using that new equipment, the transverse coagulator for the first time at the Hospital.  I think I went too deep and caused an electric current to hit the back of the eye.  I learned a lot from that."
</P>




It bothered me quite a bit and I never really trusted Bill Adel again after that.  I thought long and hard about contacting Mrs Prentice but decided it could serve no useful purpose.
