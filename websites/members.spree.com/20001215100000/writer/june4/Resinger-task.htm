<FONT FACE="Courier New" COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1"><b><P>We have a couple weeks of rain and the yard looks like a
jungle.   There is barely a path through the bedroom.  I have
somehow fallen behind in my organization and yard work
efforts.  I begin to feel panic set in until I remember how I get
through these times.  When I feel overwhelmed with large
tasks, I have found it's best to concentrate on one small area at
a time and begin visualizing the outcome.</P>  

<P>By taking it one baby step at a time I will eventually get
somewhere.  When I see progress, I either don't want to stop
or get spurred on to another project.  It helps me see that it
doesn't take as much time as I think.  One way to work in baby
steps is to set a timer for just five minutes and do what you can
on an overwhelming task.  Most of the time I'll finish the job
or at least go longer than five minutes.  You'll also find that
it
doesn't take as long as you think.  One day I set the timer for
five minutes to organize part of my dresser.  In those five
minutes I had completed three of the five drawers.  I went
ahead and finished the dresser and also switched my seasonal
clothes.</P>  

<P>In early Spring this year, my yard was way out of hand.  Weeds
were thick, plants were overgrown and my whole yard felt and
looked hopeless.  I really wanted a well kept cottage style
garden this season and thought to myself "I'll just work that
small section (about 3' X 5') over there and make it look as
good as I can -- that would be better than nothing".  That day I
did work that small section, but what amazed me was that I did
a whole lot more than that small section.  I worked my way
clipping and weeding through a flower bed that is about 3' X
25'.  Surprise Surprise!  It felt so good and looked so good
that I started on the next bed the following day and so on and
so forth.  The entire front yard was completed in a matter of
five days working 1-2 hours a day.  This showed me that I
could handle the herb garden.  So, I started the same procedure
with the herb garden and had that complete in about a week. </P> 

<P>Visualizing the outcome gives me a goal to work towards. 
Whenever I can, I try to visualize how nice the project will
look and feel when completed.  Whatever details that can be
added to the visualization makes it more powerful.  For
example, if I'm visualizing my goal of getting my bedroom
cleaned and organized, I can add to my visualization of a clean
and organized bedroom some soft music playing, a lit candle,
and a dish of fragrant potpourri.  This makes me want to
accomplish my goal so I can enjoy these things. </P> 

<P>As I worked my way through the front yard and herb garden, I
had my visualization going through my mind.  Before falling
asleep at night, I thought about walking through my cottage
style yard with all the details like butterflies and hummingbirds
flying around, fragrant flowers everywhere and enjoying my
family in this beautiful yard. </P> 

<P>If you feel overwhelmed with tasks frequently or occasionally, 
I hope you'll try these tips, they have been a sanity saver for
me.  </P>
