    The light, the figure and that ever-nearing syringe were all that 
eight-year-old
Katherine could see from the hospital gurney.  The light overhead was so 
glaring and yet it
did not improve upon the darkness surrounding her.  Each shallow breath made 
the light
and therefore the sight more of a blur, and then the figure stepped up with 
the needle in
hand.  The black silhouette stood over her obscuring the overhead lamp but 
for a glow
encircling its horrible head.  This corona was not round like that of a saint 
but fiery and
twisted in an aura of blond-red tendrils surrounding the black space that 
should have been
a face.

<P align=justify>    She gasped and was startled back to life by the full intake of air.  She 
took a
couple of quick breaths to make sure, and everything seemed to be in working 
order.  The
hospital room was bright and orderly.  Her dear mother stood at her right 
hand as her
trusting face swept back into focus.
    <P align=justify>"Kathy, how are you feeling sweetheart?" she asked.
   <P align=justify> Katherine put a small hand to her heart and gave the room a quick look to 
orient
herself.  She nodded as if it had a been a yes or no question, but the 
meaning was clear.
    <P align=justify>"The Doctor is ready to see you." her mother said.  "Are you up for a 
visit or shall
we rest here a while longer?"
    <P align=justify>She cringed slightly at the word doctor but gave a quick nod that it was 
all right. 
<P align=justify>Her mother let go of her hand and walked to the open door.
   <P align=justify> "She has never had a fear of doctors before." she whispered with concern 
to
someone just out of sight.  "This may really have affected her."
    <P align=justify>"I can take it from here." the Doctor said with condolence as Katherine's 
mother
swiped a quick tear.  "Perhaps you should wait outside."
    <P align=justify>She nodded, and seeing that Kathy was deliberately looking the other way,
departed without a wave.
   <P align=justify> Kathy was terrified to look at the open door and the man who was now
approaching with a clipboard.  She held her breath, but as he came to her 
bedside the
blurry image of what she was about to imagine suddenly dissolved and a short, 
pleasant-
looking man smiled at her.
  <P align=justify>  "Katherine, my name is Dr. Sobol." he said.  "I'm going to be your 
pediatrician.  Is
that okay with you?"
   <P align=justify> The man had short, dark hair and tan skin like a man who spends his time 
at the
beach.  When he smiled a pair of dimples appeared that he would probably be 
unable to
hide all his life.  He was probably thirty, but his face and his height were 
youthening and
put Katherine at peace like when a girl sees her first crush.
   <P align=justify> "You're breathing easy, that's good." he said.  "Do you know what 
happened to
you last night?"
   <P align=justify> "I had an asthma attack." she said.
  <P align=justify>  "Can you tell me about it?" Dr. Sobol inquired, putting down his 
clipboard.  "It's
okay if you don't want to."
   <P align=justify> "I don't mind." she said, swallowing.
   <P align=justify> She described the nightmare to him in every detail she could muster.  The 
light, the
darkness and the syringe.  He sat attentively on a tall stool at her feet, 
his white jacket
buttoned perfectly to his neck.  When she was done he sat in silence and then 
finally
spoke.
 <P align=justify>   "An interesting story." he said, his eyebrows raised.  "You're certain 
that someone
came at you with a needle?"
   <P align=justify> She nodded, afraid that by his puzzled look he did not believe her.
  <P align=justify>  "You say it was blurry..." he said.  "Blurrier with each breath.  Do you 
know what
it means to hallucinate?"
   <P align=justify> She nodded.
   <P align=justify> "It's normal to see things when you pass out," he said, "or to see a 
dream-like
version of what is actually happening."  "It's called being in a 
semi-conscious state.  It
doesn't mean there is anything wrong with you, Katherine."
  <P align=justify>  "Then it didn't happen?" she asked positively, sitting upright.
   <P align=justify> "It's true that you were lying down with an overhead lamp above you." he 
replied. 
<P align=justify>"That much is certain.  But these hospital lamps are not so bright that you 
can't see past
the glare, nor is it too dark to see either, and you did say both were the 
case if I heard you
right."
  <P align=justify>  He reached for a harmless lamp nearby, turned the long neck so she could 
see the
bulb and flipped the fairly dim light on and off a couple of times.
    <P align=justify>"And finally, you can rest assured that there was no needle." he said as 
calmly as
he could.  "Asthma patients are not injected with anything.  When you 
arrived, you were
moved directly to this room and this little tube was put in your mouth to 
help the
breathing, that's all."
   <P align=justify> She smiled at him, relieved that her nightmare was over.  She breathed 
easy and
they watched each other in reassurance for as long as Dr. Sobol deemed 
necessary.
   <P align=justify> "I'm okay now." she said, sighing.
  <P align=justify>  "Then you're not afraid of doctors?" he asked.
   <P align=justify> She shook her head vigorously.  Dr. Sobol smiled and returned to the open
doorway to get a prescription.  He passed Katherine's mother as she returned 
to the
bedside.
  <P align=justify>  "He's not so bad." Katherine stated.

<P align=justify>    She could have walked or even skipped briskly down the hall to the 
parking lot,
but she wanted to ride the wheelchair anyway.  Her mother pushed her down the 
busy
thoroughfare, and as they passed the front desk she had to stop because the 
amount of
bodies in white coats heading left and right was too crowded at the moment to 
pass
through.  In the midst of those white coats Kathy drew a faint breath and for 
a moment
thought that the world was growing pale around a writhing mass in the corner 
of her eye,
but in another moment it was gone.
  <P align=justify>  "Are you all right?" her mother asked, noticing her expression.  "You 
look like you
saw a ghost."
    <P align=justify>"I'm fine." she said.  "It's stuffy in this place, that's all."
 <P align=justify>   They returned home with an appointment for later in the week to see Dr. 
Sobol
again.  He was confident that he knew exactly what happened, but had run a 
couple of
tests on Katherine just to make sure.  By the time she returned for the 
results, there had
been no further episodes.
    <P align=justify>"I'm glad to see you again, Katherine." he said.  "No more nightmares I 
hope?"
   <P align=justify> "I don't even remember it all that well." she replied.  "Didn't happen, 
don't need to
worry about it."
   <P align=justify> Dr. Sobol and her mother exchanged a glance at her confident, if not 
comical
answer.  He pulled the results from her test, and announced that everything 
was as he
expected.
 <P align=justify>   "When your brain is not receiving enough oxygen," he explained, "it goes 
into a
shut-down mode."  "You lose consciousness, and it's natural for everything to 
go white or
blurred until the oxygen returns.  With the right medication, we can prevent 
this from
happening again."
  <P align=justify>  Kathy wanted to ride the wheelchair again, which made Dr. Sobol laugh and 
he
even volunteered to give her a push while her mother went to start the car.  
Katherine was
starting to enjoy Dr. Sobol's company, and he appeared to enjoy hers as he 
wheeled her
down the hallway faster than her mother would have.  The other white-smocked
professionals looked at the two of them as if in envy that some fun was 
actually taking
place on the premises.
    <P align=justify>The junction near the front desk was as crowded as usual so they wheeled 
to one
side of the hallway to let the traffic pass.  Katherine watched the medical 
personnel hustle
about, and began to wonder if Dr. Sobol was really one of them amongst the 
crowd of
faceless smocks.
    <P align=justify>Suddenly, she gasped and some unknown thought made her breath halt for a
frightening instant.  The world was growing pale again as if from some light 
source above,
and some of the colors she was seeing started to blend inward like running 
paint.
   <P align=justify> "Katherine?  What's wrong?" Dr. Sobol asked as he kneeled beside her.  
<P align=justify>"Are you
having an attack?  Just tell me."
   <P align=justify> She was pale as a sheet.  Something in this busy corridor had frightened 
the breath
out of her and she had no idea what it was.  A white smock passed right in 
front of her
with a large syringe held in its hand.  There was definitely something moving 
in the corner
of her eye, and by the shape of it she knew what is was.
   <P align=justify> "Kathy I can't help you unless you tell me what's wrong." Dr. Sobol said 
with
concern.
  <P align=justify>  She was definitely staring at something in the crowd.  She lifted her arm 
slowly
and pointed across the way.
 <P align=justify>   "Who is that man..." she whispered faintly.
   <P align=justify> Dr. Sobol turned around and saw only the white smocks passing in front of 
the
main desk and behind it, and more passing in and out of rooms on the far 
side.  Katherine
was visibly scared to death.
    <P align=justify>"Which one?" he whispered in reply.
    <P align=justify>"The one with the long hair..." she said breathlessly.
   <P align=justify> He rose to his feet and looked carefully, straining to see so many faces, 
and finally
spotted a smock with a long mane of reddish-blond hair sweeping past the 
collar.  The
figure was on the far side of the busy intersection about twenty yards away, 
facing the
other direction and was obscured by desk counters except for the hair, and in 
another
second was gone.
  <P align=justify>  "That would be Dr. Lang, the asthma specialist." he said, relieved to see 
that her
color was returning.  "Why, do you know him?"<P align=justify>
    "No." she stated, taking a deep and welcome breath.  "I've never seen him 
before."
   <P align=justify> "Then why were you frightened?" Dr. Sobol asked, scratching his head.
    Katherine paused and was faced with an impasse no child would be prepared 
for. 
<P align=justify>She had been so reassured, and yet the thought could not be denied.
<P align=justify>    "Because he is the man with the needle." she stated clearly.


<P align=justify>    For the next couple of days Dr. Sobol considered the possibility that he 
had
misdiagnosed Katherine's quick recovery through wishful thinking when it had 
actually
been denial.  It was evidently somewhere between the two and she may even have
recovered completely had she not seen Dr. Lang, who had nothing to do with 
this as far as
Sobol knew except that he might have been present when she was brought in 
during the
original attack.  Sobol did not know the man personally and had no reason to 
speak to him
about the matter.
  <P align=justify>  He scheduled another appointment for Katherine which he hoped would be 
the last
so they could find the problem quickly and get on with things.  It occurred 
to him just how
much guesswork is involved in medicine on a daily basis and how many times he 
had seen
the wrinkled brow of his colleagues simply weighing the odds of one vague 
symptom or
another.
    <P align=justify>Kathy and her mother came in with a better demeanor than when last he saw 
them,
a sign of the healing a couple of days can bring about.  She jumped unafraid 
onto the
white sheet as Dr. Sobol checked her vital statistics.  He was doubtful, but 
after a time it
seemed certain that recovery was in effect, not denial.  He tried to unmask 
any possible
remnant but there was none.
    <P align=justify>"Tell me about the dream again, Kathy." he said curiously.
   <P align=justify> She shrugged her shoulders.
    <P align=justify>"I don't remember it anymore." she stated, scratching her head.  "I know 
we talked
about it, but everything else is just fading away."
  <P align=justify>  "You don't see the needle?" he asked.  "You can't picture it in your 
mind?"
   <P align=justify> She shook her head vigorously, looking at the clock as if she had other 
places to
go.
   <P align=justify> "I'm not scared anymore." she said with confidence before he could even 
ask the
question.
   <P align=justify> Dr. Sobol listened to her chest a second time through his stethoscope 
while she
waited patiently staring at the ceiling.  His brow tensed as if to strengthen 
his hearing.  She
breathed slowly in and out about twenty times before the guesswork had been 
erased
enough to satisfy him.
   <P align=justify> "I am not reading any trace of asthma." he said with some amount of 
puzzlement. 
<P align=justify>"I can't make out the slightest flutter in the bronchials.  I hesitate to 
draw a conclusion, but
there's no reason to keep her here breathing for me for another hour just to 
establish the
same.  There is technically no need to even prescribe something, but I want 
to hear from
you in a week just to make sure."
   <P align=justify> Her mother nodded with a similar look of doubt.  Katherine jumped down and
made a beeline for the door, giving a quick wave of farewell to Dr. Sobol as 
if he were an
old flame she was no longer interested in.  Her mother followed her out as 
Sobol stood
there scratching his chin in contemplation.
<P align=justify>
    When he was calmly relieved at the end of the long workday and was tired 
of
thinking about Katherine and his uncertainty, Dr. Sobol unbuttoned his white 
frock and
gratefully seized a bag lunch from atop his paperwork as he stepped out.  He 
turned the
key to the door and walked casually down the hallway like a man who had just 
cast aside
his shackles.  He had an informal luncheon to attend with an intern that he 
was looking
forward to talk with about nothing in particular.
    <P align=justify>He followed the maze-like series of corridors through the building 
pleased to
exchange a look with people just beginning their shift as he was ending his.  
He had just
passed the main desk on that floor when he abruptly stopped.  Someone's 
presence had
caught his attention.  He turned slowly around, and there was an extremely 
tall man with
hair like a lion's mane standing at the far end of the counter staring at him.
   <P align=justify> Sobol continued on his way not wanting to look confused in front of any 
passers-
by and thought no more about the matter.
  <P align=justify>  "I'm going to be late if I don't hurry." he muttered, looking at his 
watch.
   <P align=justify> He turned briskly around a corner toward the elevators and there Dr. Lang 
was
again!  The long-haired man stood motionless in the middle of the hustle as 
if waiting for
him.  Sobol darted into the stairwell instead and jogged down the steps.  His 
heart was
beating too fast for everything to be normal.  When he reached the ground 
floor he broke
into a run for the doors drawing some attention to himself.
   <P align=justify> "I'm so late!" he exclaimed, staring at his watch as if his eyes were 
glued to the
dial.
   <P align=justify> He rushed for the glass doors to the outside world and reached for the 
handle
when a hand suddenly came out of nowhere and clamped down on his own..  Sobol 
was
breathing heavily, trying to look professional.  Dr. Lang stood over him, the 
white frock
under that sweeping hair immaculate like a dressed corpse.
   <P align=justify> "Just what do you think you are doing." he stated in a gravelly tone that 
left no
escape from fear.  "This is highly irregular."
   <P align=justify> "I'm late for an appointment." Sobol replied, sweat dripping from his 
forehead.
   <P align=justify> "I was referring to the girl." Lang responded coldly.
   <P align=justify> "The girl?"
    <P align=justify>"Eight years old, fair skin, blonde pigtails.  You know the one."
   <P align=justify> "My patient?" Sobol inquired.  "I'm just trying to cure her.  That is our 
duty is it
not?"
   <P align=justify> "She was my patient first!" Lang said furiously.  "Do not presume to tell 
me what
duty is you frightened irregularity.  Your lack of professionalism is not 
acceptable.  You
will come with me, little boy, now and learn the difference between what I 
want and what
will not be allowed to continue."

<P align=justify>    That evening, Kathy was playing innocently on the floor when the phone 
rang and
her mother answered from the kitchen.
    <P align=justify>"This is Dr. Sobol." the voice came hesitantly through the line.  "I'm 
sorry to
disturb you at this hour, Ma'am, but a serious mistake has been made on my 
part.  I have
reexamined your daughter's test results and the problem is far more serious 
than I thought. 
You must bring her in as soon as possible so she can see an asthma 
specialist.  I am sorry
to bring such news after today, Ma'am.  I am so very sorry."
