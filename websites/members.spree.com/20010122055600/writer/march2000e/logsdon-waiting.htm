	Sucking a Camel cigarette, Ricky Kurtz gazed out the restaurant's window into the Nevada desert. The darkness was palpable, and the building convulsed as it was battered by the wind ripping across the dark dry desert landscape, obscuring the full moon. Seeming to possess a life of its own, the night howled. 
<P align=justify>	Watching the night, Ricky could sense evil.   Jesus, what a place, thought Ricky, who at thirty-four would  rather have spent a  Saturday night in February  in his nude bar in Vegas, allowing one of the new dancers to ride his bone.  
<P align=justify>	A tall, gangly man with messy jet black hair, a nose that had been flattened from numerous fights in high school,  and dull gray eyes signaling vacant thought, Ricky sat and smoked and drank coffee, waiting for Laura.   He wore a dark green sweater, faded blue levis and black cowboy boots. Sweat dotted his brow.
<P align=justify>	Now,  at nearly midnight, he sat alone  in the twenty-four hour diner that had been at these crossroads   for as long as he could remember. He stared at the cup of black, luke-warm coffee in front of him and glanced at the two Hispanic waitresses, both  overweight, sitting at a table on the other side of the room and consuming  rhubarb pie.   The one with red hair wore a huge crucifix and had only one eye.   
<P align=justify>	The restaurant, now named Red Dingo,  sat right in the middle of Nevada,  the great empty, surrounded by  barren mountains and lying  between Caliente and Ely.   Ricky hunched over  table, listening to the  wind shriek, smoking a cigarette,  shaking from the  cold, drinking bitter coffee. A furniture-mover with two semesters of community college under his belt, Ricky Kurtz needed Laura, who should have been there hours ago.   Ricky wondered: How long does it take Laura to collect  money in the late afternoon and drive up to this shit-hole?  Two hours tops, Ricky thought to himself.  Maybe two and a half.    
<P align=justify>	He looked in the direction of the waitresses, felt his intestines rumble, saw the red-headed one look up and grin his way, and motioned that he wanted more coffee.
<P align=justify>
	His coffee warmed, Ricky lit up another cigarette, began sucking the life out of it,  and glanced at the clock on the  wall.  12:15 am. Jesus, what is keeping her? Ricky asked himself.  To relieve anxiety, he let his thoughts drift back to his first meeting with Laura.  Laura Jean Reynolds was the blond bombshell  he had fallen in love with three years ago as he had sat on a stool, watching the black girl on the stage  above him gyrate to the music. Wearing his black Spider Man T-shirt, Ricky  had barely noticed  the dancer, who even rubbed her nipples in his face,  when he had seen a tall  blonde walking towards him, her eyes directly on him. Something right out of Penthouse,   Ricky inwardly commented,  and then he remembered he had actually seen this girl, recalled  her spread in the magazine the year before, even recalled praying to God one night that he be allowed once in his life to touch such a beautiful woman.   	
<P align=justify>	The blonde had glided up to him, put her arm around his shoulders, her lips an inch from his face. Ricky noticed that this woman wore no lipstick; she didn't need to; Ricky liked that.
<P align=justify>	"Mind if I sit with you, Spider Man?" she had purred, running her tongue over her lips and brushing her breasts again him.  Ricky had gazed into her blue eyes, glanced at her breasts and nipples,  visible through a flimsy black net top, and said sure.   "Be my guest," Ricky had said, aroused.  As Laura sat next to him and moved her stool close to his, she  moved her a hand between his legs, grabbed his manhood through his pants, and  began the  massage.    
<P align=justify>	Thus had begun the only romance of Ricky's life.  Hours later, Laura had asked him to drive her home. Ricky had  obliged,  and he had stayed a week with this woman,  who had  an M. A.  in English literature. This girl is something else, Ricky thought to himself:  during the day, she taught part-time at the local university; at night,  she prowled the back street bars looking for kicks; at all times, she fucked like a mink.  Not your typical bimbo, Ricky had thought.  
<P align=justify>	He had lived with Laura since that meeting in the nude bar and once, a year ago, had  taken her to Boise to see his parents, now die-hard Pentecostals.   Jeff and Ruth Kurtz had coldly greeted their son and his girl on the porch of their century old southern Idaho farmhouse, located forty miles west of Twin Falls, and had demanded that evening over a quiet dinner that Ricky and Laura sleep in different beds.  After three days the wizened Idaho Pentecostals had asked their son to take his girl out of their house. "Sin ain't allowed here," his mother had told him point black over dinner at Misty's local diner. At that point, Ricky knew his mother and father had heard Laura's squeals of delight the night before as the two had held each other in bed. Thinking his parents were asleep, Ricky had sneaked into the next room, climbed into bed with Laura, who had been waiting for him.   "Amen," his father  had snorted as he sat next to his wife at Misty's, chewing his steak slowly, and glaring hatefully at Ricky and his girl. Ricky and Laura had left that evening.
<BR><P align=justify>
 	The experience with Ricky's parents only drew Ricky and Laura closer together. Since then, after returning to Vegas,  they  began investing what  cash they could find in deal after  deal, their most profitable venture being a nude bar named Muffy's located in the center  of Las Vegas.  While one of the most popular places in town, Muffy's didn't pay the bills, and so recently,  they had worked out a plan that allow them to live comfortably for the rest of their lives.  Ricky thought  of the plan as he sat alone in the desert in the middle of Nevada, wondering too if the waitress with the crucifix ever went to church, wondered if anyone bothered with church any more.
<P align=justify>	Sipping coffee, he recalled that the plan  had come upon Laura like  a revelation.  They had just finished screwing one month ago to the very day and, wrapped in each other's arms, were watching the Jay Leno show on  TV when Laura, her head on his chest and her hand clasped around his manhood, had calmly told Ricky that she had a plan to make them rich. 
<P align=justify>	"Wanna make  money, Spider Man?" Laura had said.
<P align=justify>	"Sure," had been Ricky's reply. "What you got in mind?"
<P align=justify>	"You're gonna like this, sugar plum," Laura had laughed.
<P align=justify>	"Out with it, then, sweetie pie," Ricky had said.    
<P align=justify>	"Well, Sugar Plum, we can knock off Rupert Grange," Laura had stated.   "Kidnap his daughter, take his money, and then put the old fucker out of his misery and head for Peru. We'll be gone before anyone knew what hit."
<P align=justify>	Ricky had paused for several minutes before risking a response.  He thought he was hearing things.  "You mean the Rupert Grange?" Ricky had finally  asked, wondering if Laura was thinking about  one of the richest men in southern Nevada. They had seen a story about Rupert Grange on the evening news less than an hour ago.  
<P align=justify>	"Yup," Laura had yawned, squeezing him gently.  
<P align=justify>	"Why kill the old bastard? Let's just take his money and run."
<P align=justify>	"We kill the old bastard, Spider Man, because he's got it coming."
	<P align=justify>"Oh," said Ricky, trying very hard to think of an intelligent response. Laura, he knew, had he own code.
<P align=justify>	Laura add, "And I know just the guys can help us. Two guys who used to work for Grange."
<P align=justify>	"Two guys...?"
<P align=justify>	"Former boy friends, dick head.  Real studs. Like you. You'll like 'em."
<P align=justify>	Ricky's head was spinning. Laura was talking about two former boyfriends.
<P align=justify>	"Think about it," she said, stifling a yawn.   
<P align=justify>	Before Ricky could say anything, Laura was asleep.
<P align=justify>	 Ricky couldn't sleep for the rest of the night.  Kidnapping his daughter and murdering  Rupert Grange would be risky,  thought Ricky, whose worst crime had been to steal a loaf of bread from the corner grocery store when he was eleven.     Ricky couldn't figure out how he had gotten messed up with a woman whose ambition was to get rich at the expense of murdering another person. For an instant, he wondered if he were going to Hell.  
<P align=justify>	He remembered what Laura had told him about Grange. Worth approximately fifty million dollars,  Grange had taken Laura on as a mistress  years before, and since then  Laura had stayed in contact,  making the point to spend at least one night a month with the old man, hoping  Grange would cut her a  share of the money when he died.   
<P align=justify>	But Grange, a tall man cut like a knife and now sixty-eight, seemed intent on living forever, jogged daily, kept a mistress, went on long hikes in the mountains just west of the city and took long trips out of the city.  In fact, at the point of Ricky's conversation with Laura, the old man had just returned from New Zealand, where he had apparently bought a snake farm and cut another land deal that would replace forests with concrete and net him several million dollars.  
<P align=justify>	Two weeks after her revelation, over coffee and toast,  Laura had assured him that the time was ripe, so several days later,  two of Laura's former boy friends--Luke and Jeff, dark swarthy sociopathic  men with cold steel blue eyes and thin gray lips--had waited in their primer gray Ford pickup in the parking lot of Lucky's supermarket one night and had kidnapped the old man's  twenty-seven year old daughter Meslissa, the apple of the old man's eye as she was walking from the store to her car.    
<BR><P align=justify>	
	  Sucking on his cigarette in the diner, Ricky recalled the headlines of  ten days ago:  Grange Daughter Missing.  Melissa Grange's disappearance, in fact, became the topic on one of the documentary-style cops shows.  And today, at 6 PM in a hidden valley just north of the city the old man was to meet Laura and her  two   sociopathic  friends alone in a canyon just north of town and, in exchange for his daughter, hand over one million dollars.  Then, one of the sociopaths was going to tell the old man and his daughter  to kneel with his back turned and put a bullet right into both of them. As he smoked and drank his coffee, Ricky tried to imagine the old man's execution but could only see in his mind's eye Laura kneeling down in some desert canyon to receive a bullet behind the ear.  
<P align=justify>	Listening to the wind and staring into the black Nevada night at Red Dingo's,  Ricky could feel the cold iron claws of an anxiety attack tearing at his head and stomach. He'd felt much the same earlier in the day. "I don't like the way this feels," Ricky had muttered to Laura that morning as he sat hunched over a breakfast of  oatmeal and toast.  "It'll be a fucking mercy killing, sweetie," Laura had assured him. "A piece of cake," had said Laura, opening her mouth wide and shoving in piece of toast covered with blueberry jam. That had been just this morning.  
<P align=justify>	It had been one hour later that they got word that Grange had agreed to the deal, and Laura had calmly reminded Ricky--still trying to concentrate on eating his oatmeal-- that the job would be like driving the car to the bank. "Killing the old fart and his daughter will be as easy as slicing meat for a ham sandwich," Laura had commented  as she walked out the door that morning, briefcase in hand, prepared to lecture her students that morning on Milton's Paradise Lost.   Upon receiving the money from the wealthy old man, Laura's friends would keep half, and Laura and Ricky were to take the rest.
