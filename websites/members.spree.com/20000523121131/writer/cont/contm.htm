i'm a typical insane poet who has written since 
she was four....i have lived many life times in the short time i've captured 
the name of kim and know that poetry comes from something that isn't 
explained in our language....i have been attending school forever it 
seems....and have been published quite a bit but refuse to believe it is 
because of any thing other than just pure luck.......so I would say to anyone 
who has the inkling to write should write and write a lot.....if about 
nothing if anything at all....because the secret to life lies between that 
whisper and the infinite giggle of time.....teeehee........oh and i have 4 
kids...should that explain my insanity?

"career" as a group counselor was shortlived, though I truly enjoyed
it.....Spirituality comes first and my dreams told me that the stress was

one could listen to me as I did to them.....feelings and thoughts must be
expressed somewhere for health's sake...I kept dairies from age 11....and

I'm originally from Cwmaman, South Wales, U.K., but now living 
in Cardigan, West Wales.  I didn't start writing poetry until 
well after my fiftieth birthday.  I have not had any tuition in 
creative writing, so am entirely self taught in this respect.  
I've traveled fairly extensively, whilst in the Royal Navy and 
since leaving in 1968.  My hobbies are fairly diverse, from Falconry 
to marathon running.  When training for a specific marathon I run 
between 120 - 130 miles per 6 day week when fit.  Sundays I rest, 
unless there's a race (of anything up to half marathon distance), 
in which case I run that too.</FONT>
