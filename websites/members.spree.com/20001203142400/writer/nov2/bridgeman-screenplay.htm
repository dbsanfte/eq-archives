Breaking into writing screenplays is about as easy as breaking into print.  In other words, it is not easy, but neither is it impossible.  The best advice I can give you is to research the subject.  There are dozens of books available that help beginning writers out.  One of the best is called THE COMPLETE BOOK OF SCRIPTWRITING by J. Michael Straczynski.  You might recognize him as one of the writers and producers of "Murder She Wrote," and "Babylon 5."
<BR><P align=justify>Another way, probably the best way, to research screenplay writing is by reading some scripts.  Several television scripts and film scripts are available at your local bookseller.  By reading a few scripts, studying the conventions used in them, you will better understand proper screenplay format.
<BR><P align=justify>The purpose of this article is to introduce you to the most popular screenplay terms and the basics of proper screenplay format.  There are several software packages available that can help ease you into screenplay format, such as SCRIPTWIZ, HOLLYWOOD SCREENWRITER, SCRIPT THING, and SCRIPTWARE.  While most of them are nice, enhancing productivity and speeding up the screen writing process, they are also unnecessary, at least for someone first starting out.
<BR><P align=justify>For screenplays, Courier font is preferred.  Here is a review of the basic proper screenplay format.  Space from the edge of the page is given in picas:  (NOTE: A pica is roughly equivalent to one typed space.)

Slugs/Headers or Footers - generally no slug lines, headers, or footers are used because scripts are bound manuscripts.  However, every page should have a page number in the upper right hand corner.

<BR><P align=justify>There are over two-hundred acronyms, abbreviations, and common terms used in screen writing.  Rather than define all of them, the following is a review of the most commonly used terms and how they should be treated in your screenplay.

<FONT color="#008000">Terms, acronyms, and abbreviations:<BR><P align=justify>
<BR><P align=justify>Transitions:
<BR><P align=justify>CUT TO	- Most common transition, used to cut from one scene to another immediately without break or blackout and without any camera work in between.
<BR><P align=justify>BLACKOUT	- An immediate darkening of the screen that does not signal the end of the script.
<BR><P align=justify>DISSOLVE	- This device moves the story from one location to another by superimposing the first few seconds of the next scene over the last few seconds of the preceding scene.
<BR><P align=justify>FADE IN	- An indication that the script is now beginning.  The term Fade-in is used only once at the beginning of the manuscript.
<BR><P align=justify>FADE OUT	- Signals the conclusion of the script.  The term Fade-out is used only once at the end of the manuscript.
<BR><P align=justify>INTERCUTTING	- Signals important things happening in two different locations simultaneously.  This means the camera will cut back and forth from one location to the other during the scene.   
<BR><P align=justify>MATCH CUT		- A way of dissolving one element in a scene into a similar element in a different scene.  For example, in the movie THE HIGHLANDER, the camera moves into a slow, tight close up of an aquarium in Conner MacLoed's Manhattan apartment and pulls back on to the surface of a lake several hundred years earlier in Scotland.  Say you have a character watching a live report on television of a meteor shower in Los Angeles from the safe confines of his kitchen in Nebraska and the scene shifts to that Los Angeles location and the report in progress.  This treatment was used in the film DEEP IMPACT, for example.
<BR><P align=justify>SOLERIZATION	- This is the opposite of a blackout.  The scene fills with light so that, eventually, nothing but light is visible. </font>
<BR><CENTER><HR></CENTER><BR><FONT color="#FF8000">
<BR><P align=justify>Camera Directions:
<BR><P align=justify>B.G. 	- Background, the area furthest from the lens of the camera that is still within clear visible range.  "While Kirk and Picard discuss firing the contractor who provided the inertial dampeners, an alien devours the half naked green woman in the B.G."
<BR><P align=justify>F.G.	- Foreground, quite simply the opposite of Background.
<BR><P align=justify>CLOSE SHOT - Indication that the camera should close in on specific action, usually to emphasize the way the action relates to the plot.  "As they shake hands, the prisoner slips the nun a tiny note in a CLOSE SHOT."
<BR><P align=justify>CU	- Close Up, an indication that the camera should close in on the actor's expression.  Close ups usually include the entire face or even the entire head.  "Marion enters the bedroom to find husband Howard in bed with the Joani's cheerleader friend.  CU on Marion."
<BR><P align=justify>ECU	- Extreme Close Up, Similar to Close up but more intense, usually only showing the eyes and possibly the nose in the shot.
<BR><P align=justify>EXT.	- Exterior, notation establishing that the action is taking place outdoors.  The notation is used to begin the scene along with the time of day and the scene number if needed as in EXT: MALL <BR><P align=justify>PARKING DECK - NIGHT.
<BR><P align=justify>INT.	- Interior, meaning inside, usually accompanied by a description of the scene inside.  INT. ALIEN SHIP- INDETERMINATE TIME.
<BR><P align=justify>FRAME	- The portion of the scene that is visible to the camera and framed by the lens at any given moment of a shot.
<BR><P align=justify>SHOT		- Everything that the camera does between any two transitions is considered a shot.
<BR><P align=justify>CLOSE SHOT - The camera is close to the subjects of the shot.  For example, if the characters are in the front seat of a car that is in motion and the camera is mounted on the hood, as close as possible to the subjects while still taking them both in.
