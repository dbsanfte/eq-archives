<P>	I had everyone fooled. To the world-at-large, I was a
                               successful fashion model, my confident smile bursting
                               from local advertisements, my self-assured self
                               sauntering down runways.</P>

                      <P>But, as cool and confident as I appeared, there was a simple part of
                      the day that I avoided. I never wanted to look at myself in the
                      mirror. When I got ready in the morning, I turned off the lights. If a
                      makeup artist was handling the task, I shut my eyes. Mirrors only
                      reminded me of the imperfections, and the face that stared back
                      was far from perfect.</P>

                      <P>Only my mom and my best friend knew about my inability to face
                      my own face. My friend thought it was weird. So did I, but –
                      looking back on that era of my life – it makes perfect sense. 
</P>
                     <P> I remember the day, for example, that a New York agent boomed,
                      “I’d be interested in seeing you after a boob job and a nose job.”
                      His exact words to a nervous 15-year-old. I choked back tears
                      when I told my mother, who was waiting in the lobby. She quickly
                      swallowed the “how dare he...” in favor of something with more
                      wisdom, an assurance that this business would surely help me
                      understand and accept rejection.
</P>
                      <P>Only now that I am a mother can I understand the rage my mother
                      must have felt that day. Just the thought of someone saying that to
                      my daughter makes my chest tighten. Cassidy is not yet 2, but I
                      can’t bear the thought of her ever turning off the lights so she
                      doesn’t have to see the imperfect reflection.
</P>
                    <P>  I want it to be different for my daughter. I want her to be proud of
                      the body God gave her. I want her to appreciate its strength, its
                      poise, and, most of all, its potential.</P>

                     <P> The best way to make it different for our children is to make it
                      different for us. Psychologists and self-help authors tell us how to
                      embrace our bodies once and for all. Stand before a full-length
                      mirror without any clothes on, they say. Dance around the room
                      naked. I don’t know about you, but I can’t imagine myself ever
                      doing that. These days, I can manage to look at myself in the mirror,
                      but let’s not push it.</P>

                      <P>It’s much easier, really, to buy into the latest trend that promises to
                      improve our outsides. I used to call it Haircut Anticipation: that
                      eager feeling you get when you make an appointment for a new ‘do,
                      knowing that this new haircut (or this fresh tube of lipstick or this
                      new weight-loss program) will somehow turn your life around.
</P>
                     <P> I know I’m not alone. It’s what keeps the cosmetics, weight-loss,
                      and cosmetic surgery industries raking in the billions each year. And
                      it’s what advertisers bank on when they feature women that look
                      better, younger, and more rested than we ever could. I watched a
                      documentary the other day in which a photograph, destined for the
                      pages of a popular women’s magazine, had to be airbrushed
                      because the 17-year-old model looked too old!
</P>
                      <P>The self-helpers who dance around naked also tell us we should
                      simply accept ourselves the way we are. But that doesn’t
                      undermine the fact that we all want to look our best. And we can
                      lament all we want the fact that physical appearance matters in this
                      world, but that won’t change the simple fact that it does.
</P>
                    <P>  That doesn’t mean we need to focus on looking better. It means we
                      need to focus on feeling better about the way we look. One of the
                      biggest lessons I took away from my modeling career was that a
                      woman who projected confidence always got the job over someone
                      who didn’t. No matter what she looked like. When I know I look
                      good, I feel - and therefore am - smarter, sexier, more productive,
                      and more confident.</P>

                      <P>A more positive body image can help us in all of our roles. When
                      we feel good about our bodies, we treat them with more respect,
                      and our physical fitness improves. We become more effective in our
                      social and professional pursuits. When we move our health and
                      happiness to the forefront of our focus, our spirits soar, and we
                      create footsteps we want our children to follow.
