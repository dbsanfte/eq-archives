</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>© L. January<BR>
<BR><p> There, in the orange glow of the city with its rivers of houses and pools of high-rise towerblocks,
                 amongst the railways stretching forever outwards and occasional green splurge of flora, was the
                 ubiquitous smell of life, the ever-present drumming of pulsing hearts and hypnotic sound of breathing.
                 Though these lives fascinated him in their diversity and futility as each drew out an inevitable track
                 across time, he loathed each and every individual blessed with the gift of life more than anything else he
                 knew of. It was the combination of his hatred and the wonder he felt as he watched them, 20th century
                 people, as he had watched all mankind, which captured his attention more than the beauty of perfect
                 gardens, the magic of the oceans and the enormity of the skies.<BR><P> Mostly he watched as he did now,
                 sitting on the cusp of the millennium and gazing over them, taking an Asmodeus flight and peering into
                 their privacy with the wanton disregard of a superior being. Occasionally, this seemed unsatisfactorily
                 distant and he yearned to feel the detestable power of life from within; thus, stepping down from the
                 heavens, he slipped into a parody of mortal form, conceitedly granting himself every perfection though
                 this seemed to create unease amongst those he contacted. Never had his attempts to walk among
                 mankind as one of their own brought him anything more than unhappiness and he had often
                 contemplated the possibility that his method had failed him.
<BR><P> It was the winter of 1998, and he watched
                 the Valentine's night celebrations of a lustful couple with distaste and disinterest from on top of their
                 roof. A large black cat sat beside him, conjured by him, watching him as he watched them; eyes
                 unblinking, no breathe escaping its lungs, no heart inside it to beat. "I am doing this wrong," the demon
                 told the cat. "How am I to learn why I must love them and loathe them? How am I to discover why I
                 must watch them so intently, unable to tear myself away?" The cat smiled at him knowingly. "Perhaps
                 such a discovery will grant my freedom," the demon pondered. <BR><P>The cat stood up and stretched. "Or
                 your imprisonment," it said, causing the demon to hurriedly uncreate it, wishing his tendency to create
                 gloomy companions would abandon him. <BR><P>The demon looked away from the couple and up to the
                 skies, searching for an answer in the stars. Demons had often walked among men yet so few ever
                 came away content with their experiences that it seemed all must be going about it the wrong way. As
                 he looked across the skyline of London, he saw the neon cross of a North London church and
                 remembered that even god had been part of mankind, which was when it struck him that he should not
                 be a demon in the company of mortals, but a demon in a mortal amongst mortals.<BR><P> Smiling to himself, he
                 rode the wind to a dark place where he could summon the power to fund his project and formulate a
                 plan that would end his watching days. The thunder shook the window panes and the lightning
                 illuminated the entire room through thin landlord-brown curtains.<BR><P> Vyvyan parted the curtains, along
                 with the nets behind them, and climbed up the landlord-brown sofa to press himself against the tall sash
                 windows and look out to the sky. The thrill of the storm sent a familiar chill through him, reminding him
                 that the world was a little older than him and much more powerful. No matter what the scientists
                 discovered, and they did persist in discovering things, they could never harness the force of
                 earthquakes, or volcanoes, merely predict them and watch the destruction they brought. <BR><P>Satiated, he
                 pulled away, tidily tucking the curtains back into place and falling into the sofa. The TV flickered
                 statically across the room but he did nothing to change the channels; the static was the best thing
                 scheduled at this time of night. The bedsit was a lonely place at the best of times, so impersonal in its
                 magnolia and beige with varying ages of cupboard incongruous with the Victorian height and shape of
                 the room, but in the small hours with dark noisy skies overhead, he wasn't just lonely, he felt like the
                 last person left alive. He got up from the sofa and crossed to the stacks of books, which begged for
                 shelving but would have to wait until he had a job and could afford such luxuries. Having read them all,
                 it was a case of finding the one with the perfect balance of being good and vaguely unfamiliar. He
                 sacrificed not knowing the ending as he picked up an old favourite. It was only because he was by his
                 door, holding the book thoughtfully remembering its contents, that he heard the quiet knock on the
                 front door downstairs.<BR><P> He crossed quickly to the sofa, dropping the book, and heaved open the
                 window. The rain came down on him as he leaned out to see who stood at the front door. The
                 inconsiderate visitor was sheltered under the porch and he drew back into his room, pulled down the
                 window, and dug out a shirt from between the cushions. Despite being in a typically antisocial mood,
                 Vyvyan was pleased by the prospect of a guest to relieve his momentary boredom. He scampered
                 down the stairs, missing out the last few as usual to thump heavily onto the hall's linoleum. The
                 stranger's distorted silhouette in the frosted glass was dark and tall and, for a moment, Vyvyan
                 considered that whoever it was might be malevolent or supernatural or vaguely interesting, before he
                 recalled that everybody was wearing dark coats this winter. He opened the door, smiled up at the man
                 standing in the porch and felt small. Tall and broad, his visitor was, with a distastefully perfect
                 Hollywood face and deep dark eyes that didn't seemed to fit with the rest of him. He was the bad guy
                 who had gone good and still wore the long black coat from his wayward days. Yet he was completely
                 soaked through, his hair plastered to his head and beads of rain clinging to every surface that they
                 could, failing and dripping steadily on the doorstop.<BR><P> "Can I use your phone?" the stranger asked
                 smoothly, each word falling from his mouth like a polished gemstone.<BR><P> "Yeah, sure," Vyvyan said, hating
                 him. He stepped back and allowed the man to walk inside, yearning to know why the man had
                 allowed himself to be so thoroughly drenched by the storm but resisting the urge to just ask. "It's
                 upstairs, on the landing," he added.<BR><P> "Thank you," the stranger said, pausing in the hallway.
