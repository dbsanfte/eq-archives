	<P>When I woke this Saturday, there was no sign anything was different. Another fall morning carrying the crisp voices of parents cheering on their sons and daughters playing soccer at Kent Commons Field. A light breeze whisking tree limbs, sending dead leaves into tailspins towards the ground. The soft undulations of train whistles in the distance. The certain things you notice, that become a part of you, after living in Kent Valley for twenty-six years. 
</P>

<P>But the familiar didn't prepare me for what awaited me when I opened the newspaper. When I scanned the Nation & World and stopped at the AP snippet announcing that Richard Farnsworth, the actor, died Friday night, at the age of 80, from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. </P>
	<P>I was shocked</P>
	<P>It was only this summer when I had watched his performance in the movie, "The Straight Story." A true story about a man named Alvin Straight, who, due to ailing health and eyesight, rides his John Deere lawnmower 320 miles, from Iowa to Wisconsin, to make amends with his dying brother. It's a slow, poignant road movie filled with parables that shed wisdom and insight on life. A role that won him an Oscar nomination, praise from movie reviewers, and a magical six-minute standing ovation from the extremely-hard-to-impress Cannes Film Festival audience. It also won my heart and inspired me. Inspired me to the point where I did something I've never done before for another actor or actress. I searched down his address and wrote him a letter. A letter that soon materialized into long, drifting vistas, much like the roadside scenery in "The Straight Story." </P>
	<P>The letter began by praising his quiet dignity on the screen. I told him in detail how his various roles touched my life. Like his role as Matthew Cuthbert, in the PBS Wonderworks production of Anne of Green Gables, had inspired me to search for L.M. Montgomery's books. And soon, without hesitation, I was telling him about my grandpa growing up in Iowa, about my dreams of being a writer, about the subtle nuances of my hometown. I wrote about things that could only pour out when writing to a stranger. Except, by the end of the letter, he no longer felt like a stranger. I could envision him listening intently as someone read him excerpts, and, by the end, him giving a humble nod of recognition. </P>
	<P>Days after sending the letter, to my surprise, I received a manila envelope sporting a faded figure of Billy the Kid alongside the postmark from Lincoln, New Mexico. Inside was an 8" x 11" black and white photograph, signed: "For Ron - my Best, Richard Farnsworth." It was an unexpected kindness. I never asked for an autograph. He even paid the dollar postage out of his own pocket. </P>
	<P>But months after that bit of generosity, I was suddenly staring at that same picture, into his kind eyes peering out from his plains drifter exterior, searching for answers as to why he shot himself. </P>
	<P>It didn't make sense. </P>
	<P>Richard Farnsworth was tough. During the Depression, he quit school at fifteen and started working as a stable boy. Two years later, in 1937, he was riding horses on film for seven dollars a day. For more than thirty years he was a Hollywood stuntman, appearing in numerous westerns, doubling for Henry Fonda (who Farnsworth once said in an interview was his favorite actor, affectionately calling him "Hank."), Gary Cooper, and even stunt-doubled for Kirk Douglas for eleven months of filming in "Spartacus." </P>
	<P>He was the kind that quietly endured, like his career. He never had a speaking role until he was 57, when he appeared in "Comes a Horseman." Which earned him his first of two career Oscar nominations. And with that debut recognition came many movies to follow:  "The Grey Fox," "The Natural," "Tom Horn," "Anne of Green Gables," "Misery," etc. Though, even with that success, his humble opinion of his own acting came out in an interview, when he said: "I'm not that good an actor, but I am a good cowboy." </P>
	<P>That's one reason why it was so hard for me to understand. Good cowboys don't shoot themselves. They come back in the third act to save the day. Not bow out, leaving a fiancee and two children behind scratching their heads, wondering, "Why?" Like me.</P>
	<P>It wasn't until I found the AP story, in its entirety, when I found the answers I was searching for. </P>
	<P>Several years ago, Farnsworth had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and had been battling it ever since. Even during the filming of "The Straight Story," in which Farnsworth's fiancee, Jewel Van Valin said, "He was very ill in that movie, but phenomenally he made it through. He didn't want the world to know he was sick." </P>
	<P>She also included, "He couldn't fight it, and cancer got him." </P>
	<P>And with that, it was clear to me. His act wasn't of cowardice, but of dignity. </P>
	<P>I could see it now. It was like his role as Dodger in "Comes a Horseman." Dodger is involved in an accident and falls off his horse. His friends bring him back to camp and he's holding on, but not truly living. Later, when nobody is around, all eyes off of him, he drags his broken body up onto his horse and rides up into the mountains to die alone, with dignity. </P>
	<P>And even though Richard Farnsworth is now gone from this earth, having symbolically ridden into those mountains, his legacy lives on in indelible movie images, in memories, and in hearts. To me, he's like this valley; he becomes part of you. </P>
