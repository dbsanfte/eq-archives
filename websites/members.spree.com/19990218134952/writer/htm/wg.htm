<Font size=5> GENERAL GUIDELINES <BR><BR> <font size=4>
Please use "Submission" as the subject of all submissions.<br>
Send attachments as either plain text or word docs. <br>
If in doubt - send the work to me - we'll discuss it. <BR>
I wish that it were different - but we can not pay you for your work.<br> However
the main goal of this publication is to help writers - while shaking up the
reader and providing a new avenue of thought for them. Your goal as a writer
should approximate the same - so here is your forum.<br>
If you make a submission and have heard nothing from me within a month please
resubmit or write an inquiry.
