<P align=justify>
The recent cloning of the sheep called "Dolly" has heralded an epoch in the history of humanity that is uniquely singular in terms of its achievement.  With this single stroke of scientific genius, the prodigal human has finally instilled life into the canvas of his creation.  The manufacture of all life forms can now be accomplished by its highest echelon; the supreme species.  While the sheep "Dolly" will undoubtedly go down in the annals of history, as a testimony of human scientific triumph, what is more uncertain is the nature of this success from a historical, ethical, and retrospective perspective.  Is this the final pinnacle of man's ingenuity or does this define the pedestal of future success?   Will this breakthrough push mankind over the precipice to its doom, or will it extricate humanity from the morass of hapless stagnation into the exultation of creative paradise?  The answers to all these questions will be provided with the passage of time.  For now we can simply conjecture. 
<P align=justify>
The facts and enormity of this discussion are often obfuscated by the arguments that it emanates.  The cloning of the sheep "Dolly" was the first time that an adult mammal could be cloned from its cells into its genetic replica.  It did not require the classic fusion of male and female that has defined reproduction in our species since the beginning of time.  This technique is scientifically called "nuclear transfer".  The magnitude of this breakthrough lies in the sheer simplicity of its approach wherein a complex human being comprising of billions of cells can be genetically duplicated by using a single cell from its being.  The nucleus of the donor cell is implanted into a female egg cell, and given the right conditions, matures into a human embryo.  While the technology is currently far from perfected for human cloning, the eventual success of this methodology for humans is a matter of time. 
<P align=justify>
Ever since the production of "Dolly", there has been a spate of reports claiming successful cloning of various mammals in diverse developed countries of the world.  The proliferation of cloning experiments is reminiscent of the nuclear race that has shrouded our civilization for more than half a century. The race is on now for the manufacture of the first human clone by nuclear transfer.
<P align=justify>
In the interim, however, there is an intense debate brewing both in the intelligentsia and the common public regarding the repercussions of scientific research in this arena.  While the cloning bandwagon gathers momentum within the scientific community, the public is largely apprehensive, and the political leaders all over the world have expressed their personal reservations regarding the endeavor.  An overwhelming rationale for these political decisions panders to the widespread public furore and indignation over the sanctity of human life.  Some of this also stems from the fact that there is an inherent cynicism in certain segments of the discerning populace regarding the benevolence of twentieth century science.  The malevolence and global fear unleashed as a result of nuclear and biochemical weapons attest to the fact that the implementation of each innovation is as important as the invention itself.  While nuclear energy and the breakthroughs in biochemical engineering, when utilized with prudence, have revolutionized our world for the better, the destructive by products of the same science in the hands of a few irresponsible individuals or nations is a constant threat to humanity.  The extensive extermination caused by the atom bomb in Japan, the mass massacre attributed to Eugenics in Nazi Germany, and the agonizing annihilation effected by the biochemical weapons in Vietnam, all attest to the truancy of science when deployed in the wrong hands.  Scientific achievements are no longer viewed as disparate sweet human aberrations to enhance society but instead as integral social elements that have the potential to alter the course of human civilization.  Human cloning, therefore, needs to be evaluated on this holistic social crucible.
<P align=justify>
The opponents and proponents of Genetic Cloning cite numerous arguments to support their stance on this issue.  The proponents rest on the hope, that when perfected, this formidable science would help alleviate and potentially eradicate a myriad of ailments afflicting humans.  Conversely, the opponents rest their case on the fear that this alarming art of human ingenuity could be misused to wreck havoc with the natural order.
<P align=justify>
Arguments for cloning are numerous.  The positives cater to the external; overall improvement, enhancement of the human species.
<P align=justify>
Human organs could be harvested specifically for the purpose of transplants.  Embryos could be developed and stored in cryogenic environment as insurance for critical human organs.  Additionally, some of these embryos could be incubated, when needed, to beget offspring.  Hundreds of thousands of people succumb each year to dearth of compatible organs.  With the advent of cloning technology, compatible organs could be cultivated to meet this ever-growing demand.  Cloning could provide the much needed succor to infertile couples that have been languishing for a progeny and are either skeptical of some other techniques or have not had the desired success. This technology can also provide for procreation amongst the lesbian couples who would have to ordinarily seek male sperm cells for impregnation.  Cloning could be utilized to synthesize certain curative chemicals in other animals.   The animals could therefore, theoretically, be a virtual cornucopia for these chemicals to cure a host of ailments plaguing mankind.  Given the current climate of physical enhancement using artificial aids, cloning is bound to be a resounding success in the field of cosmetic surgery.  Everything from breast implants, to facial lifts would be revolutionized when humanity ushers in this "age of the clone".  Human genetic replicas could finally be created, satiating, in part, our eternal quest for immortality.  Even better, these genetic duplicates could be programmed to be younger by altering the biological time clock of the cloned genes.  Humanity could finally repay its debt to the ecosystem by having the ability to clone endangered species and ensure their survival.
<P align=justify>
Arguments against cloning are relatively less established in tangibles.  These advocate primarily restraint, introspection and reflection; an overall consonance with our personal and social conscience.
<P align=justify>
Cloning of humans and/or animals could possibly result in some medical backlash that the highly developed, hubris science of our generation does not foresee.  Mankind could be subject to a multitude of new, exotic diseases akin to AIDS owing to the proliferation of cloning organs and organisms.  Cloning of embryos for organ transplants raises the ethical issue of the sanctity of life, however unicellular the form may be.  The market for cloning human antidotes in domesticated animals could possibly lead to widespread cultivation of desired animals cloned expressly for the purpose of providing the elixir for humanity.  Animals would be synthesized as commodities with abject disregard for their well being as a species.  On a socio-ethical front, the advent of cloning will strip the vestige of sanctity out of human reproduction.  On a larger scale, this technology could be utilized to determine artificial selection for natural species.  Somatic cell nuclear transfer could well crystallize the evolution of mankind from a gradual, incremental, and natural process to a radical, rapid, and artificial progression.  Critics have raised some concerns regarding the safety and certainty of this procedure.  In the cloning experiments performed on animals to date, numerous embryos have been created and later destroyed owing to defective characteristics.  Replication of this technique, as it exists currently, would likewise result in annihilation of defective human embryos.  Therefore, until and unless this technology is honed to perfection, it would, in all likelihood, present an ethical dilemma for our superfluously scrupulous mankind.  Then, there are issues raised by some that are relatively intangible, and of a more esoteric nature.  These pertain to the absence of the soul in a cloned organism, and that this procedure contravenes tenets established in different religions. Lastly, there are public fears stemming due to an overdose of the fantastic imagination of science fiction writers and Hollywood moguls.  These are predominantly related to cloning of dinosaurs, creating an army of subservient sub-human slaves, cloning of physical replicas by millionaires, and numerous others in the same genre.  While these could be brushed aside as plain figment of imagination, they do represent a frightening reality in light of the cloning experiments conducted in Nazi Germany.

<B>Conclusion </B>
<P align=justify>
While both the supporters and the critics of human cloning have certain legitimate points in their assertions, from a rational and objective perspective, it is fairly obvious to the discerning that cloning would be intrinsically and invariably beneficial for mankind. The arguments against it are mostly opinions, sheer speculation, having meager validity in terms of both ratiocination and substance.  But in the final analysis, it is fear that is foremost driving force behind all the current opposition to cloning.  Fear of defiling the sanctity of human life, fear of playing god, fear of the aftermath, and above all the familiar fear of the unknown and the fear of change that results from confronting it.  Science, however, calls this "fear of change" as the bastion of human stagnation.  It has constantly challenged its smug scaffolds of constancy by its forays of inspiring aspirations. In this eternal battle between static and dynamics, science and change has always emerged victorious.  The science of human cloning is no exception.  The result is a foregone conclusion.  In this age of science and technology, change is the norm.  Human cloning is here to stay.
<P align=justify>
Ever since the dawn of human history, the interplay of creativity and change has defined its evolution.  Radical endeavors in arts and science have come to define the advancement of mankind.  Scientific accomplishments to explain and explore the truth, have survived and flourished, despite the denunciations and malicious machinations of powerful establishments.  The triumphs of the theories of Copernicus, Newton, and Galileo amongst numerous other luminaries attest to the inexorable power of this quest for the unknown.  In more recent times, the advances in the field of nuclear fission and fusion for harnessing viable energy could not be thwarted despite the mass destruction caused by the use of the atomic bomb.  Similarly, the juggernaut unleashed in the field of medical science with the introduction of the test tube baby and culminating in cloning, can, will, and should not be slowed down by the stoic establishments of this generation.  No matter how hard we try, the die is already cast; cloning is undoubtedly the technology of the future.  Rather, the prudent approach is to devise ways on how best to tame it, channel it for the benefit of mankind.
<P align=justify>
So, the key here is how best to control, manage, and supervise cloning.  Establishing guidelines for its implementation would be the logical place to start.  We need to ensure that there are enough checks and balances to pre-empt any degenerate escalation of this practice to serve vested interests.  Unlike the nuclear non-proliferation treaty that happened after the event, an ethics committee, a council of intellectuals needs to be set up at the outset, prior to human cloning becoming commonplace, to help guide in its development and control its mechanics.  A plausible methodology could be to create Best Management Practices for Cloning that would apply globally, transcending all national boundaries, politics and polity.  A medical board could be launched in each country that coordinates and controls all activities and research related to human cloning.  A scientist or a doctor intending to practice research or actual human cloning would need to get the requisite assent from this national board via a license or a permit prior to performing the procedure.  All these national medical boards would operate under the umbrella of an International Board of Cloning Ethics that would act as a watchdog to protect the interests of the global human community.  This tight system of overseeing and management at the local and international level will ensure prevention of abuse of the technology in the hands of irresponsible personnel.  While no system is perfect, this could be as close to utopia that is realistically possible.

<P align=justify>However, to err is human.  Can we trust a human to create a human? 

<P align=justify>There still remains the unanswered query about human cloning and the fate of our race in matters that transcend the physical.  The answer to the metaphysical, although troublesome, is currently beyond my perspicacity.  After a successful campaign of designing inanimate objects for personal gains in this millennium, humans are on the verge of mastering the science of creation.  Immortality surely cannot be far behind!  However, in our zeal to create the physical, are we overlooking some intrinsic intangibles, like the soul that completes an individual?  Granted, the spiritual and metaphysical is not in the purview of our contemporary science, but unknown to the human intellect, this could be of great importance.  Maybe these ethereal, exotic thought domains are expendable and/or do not really exist.  Or maybe mankind was too good to be TRUE.  Man would ultimately make it FALSE. 

<P align=justify>I for one am not too excited about life in the Cloning Era.
