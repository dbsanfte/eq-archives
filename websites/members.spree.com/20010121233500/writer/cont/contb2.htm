	I was born in Koln, Germany. My family left when I was a very young
                 child. 

                 We ventured on, across the Atlantic on a huge ship - then traveled
                 on to British Colombia, Canada by the railways. My passion for
                 nature & the animal kingdom stem from my daily walks into the deep
                 forest behind our house ( log cabin ). I frequently interacted with
                 the Black Bear & all the Winged Ones. I found an abundance of
                 serenity in the deep woods. I also frequently visited the Indian
                 Reservation near by. My beliefs are closest to the Lakota, for this
                 tribe has the upmost reverance for our Mother, the Earth, the Animal
                 kingdom, the Elderly, the Children, and the Elements. I believe in
                 simplicity and what truly dwells inside the heart and soul....the
                 eyes have it! 

                 My first love is Music....I find music to be very inspirational for
                 my writing And illustration. The Arts are very important to me. The
                 freedom of expession is a priority of mine. The material rewards are
                 not that important. I believe in creating, doing, being, living ART!
                 The creation of art itself is the reward and being able to share it
                 with others. My writing usually takes on a BEAT vibe... the Beat
                 Poets have grabbed me, also the unique poetry of E. Poe and Blake.
                 There are many artists that have inspired me and continue to do so.
                 I have felt ART flowing through my veins for many years and it is a
                 gift to me that I may share it with you.........so let us do some
                 jazz and beat...enjoy the Blues beat.......read like jazz and drift
                 on out peoples! </FONT>

				  I was born in 1969. At least this year is written on my birth certificate. I do
                 not remember when I started to write SciFi, but I do remember that
                 one of my first published stories was (when I was a student) written
                 as a homework. 
                 Except this story, all others are written because I enjoy the act of
                 writing. The only payment I have received till now are the good
                 words from you, the readers, and believe me, this is payment enough.

The picture, in case you are curious, is the

told us that we were supposed to freeze the top of our wedding cake and then eat
it on our first anniversary.  We attempted this and decided that a food fight
would be much healthier for our stomachs.

	<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="-1">born the son of an Army officer and
                 traveled all over North America and
                 Europe growing up. He attended
                 Berea College and North Carolina
                 State University before deploying
                 as an activated Army Reservist to
                 participate in Operation Desert
                 Shield/Storm. For the next two
                 years, Gregg served as a Sergeant
                 in a Special Operations capacity in
                 Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, and
                 Turkey. Since returning home in
                 1992, he has worked for IBM, GTE,
                 Knowledge Source, and ADS
                 Consulting. 
                 Gregg writes mostly science fiction but occasionally dabbles
                 in other genres. His poetry has been published in such places
                 as A Writer's Choice Literary Journal Online, Inkwell, Peer
                 Amid, and the X-er's, In Our Own Voice poetry anthology. He
                 wrote a series of articles entitled, The Elements of Formal
                 Style, which he hopes to compile and publish as a short
                 instructional book someday. "There are a lot of books and
                 manuals available to help new authors, but few of them really
                 motivate and none really address the Formal Style of writing,
                 which appears to be going the way of the dinosaur in today's
                 literature." 
                 Today, Gregg travels all over North America as a certified
                 computer consultant and instructor. Currently, he dedicates
                 all of his spare time to completing his science fiction
                 novel, The Dama Project, and editing the work of another
                 mainstream author. </FONT>

               <img src="http://members.spree.com/writer/cont/sb.jpg" align=left>  in the past year re-discovered writing poetry. I belong to the Louisville Poets' Guild, which is a free
                 poetry group which contains many talented and decidedly different styles of poets. I also frequent a
                 local open mic called the Java House, which showcases local poets in a very intimate setting, however
                 it usually draws a huge crowd. I write mainly for myself, as a release of whatever thoughts i may be
                                                  having at the time. However, the forum of poetry

                                                  using what i call 'visual poetry', which to me means,
                                                  trying to paint the most vivid poem that i can, for the
                                                  particular subject that i happen to be writing about. I

	Lida Broadhurst <FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#804000" SIZE="-1">Ever since I was in high school writing poetry & prose have been
                 important in my life, but at the same time I did not always want to share my thoughts. After
                 my husband and I retired, I felt more confident and able to send my thoughts on cats, kids,
                 love, and city life out to magazines. A few years ago, I began writing darker work about
                 odd twists on myths or the monsters who inhabit our world. Now I just accept whatever
                 thoughts arise at midnight, be they humorous, warm, loving, or horrific. I am grateful that
                 almost 150 pieces of my work have been printed in publications like "Zuzu's Petals",

	I have been reading and writing modern American poetry since the
1960’s when I attended college.  I have an MFA in creative writing from Wichita
State University.  I have been a teacher of English at the secondary and
college levels.  I am new to the Internet and poetry sites.  However, my
poetry has been published in numerous literary magazines.  Here are a few of
the most recent:

I make my living as a computer specialist, but still I write
serious modern
poetry as a hobby.  I believe that form, language usage, and voice
are the
essential ingredients for any successful poem.  I write every day.
I
re-write continuously because most poems are never perfect, never
finished,
require constant tweaking to get the maximum communication to the
reader.

I like to discuss prosody and the creative process.  My favorite
dead poets
are Walt Whitman and Wallace Stevens.  My favorite living poets are
David
Lehman and Bob Hicok.  Philosophically, I am a scientific secular
humanist,
religiously neutral and believe that tolerance is the key to
happiness.

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#B7005B" SIZE="-1">
was born in Arlington, Texas in 1973. At the age of eight, he
began writing short stories in a backyard tool shed and, by twelve, had completed two
collections of short stories as well as several novels and screenplays. Jeff graduated from
Baylor University in Waco shortly after the Branch Davidian crisis for which that area is
notorious. In 1996, Jeff's first book of poetry, <U>Slow Christmas</U>, was published by
<U>Brownflower Press</U>. Later that same year, Jeff moved with his wife to Cambridge,
Massachusetts where he founded a poetry workshop, published his second collection of
poems (<U>An Exciting Wonderful</U>), and began to consider himself a "new surrealist".
In June 1998 Jeff moved back to Texas to take up residence in Austin where he recently
completed work on his third book of poems, <U>Lucifer Starfish</U>, a book dealing with the
nature of good and evil. Jeff has spent the last six months working as an elementary school
art teacher in the Austin Independent School District and preparing his fourth collection of
poems, <U>Crutch-Makers And Insects</U> for publication some time this fall. Jeff's poems have
appeared in various publications as well as several online forums such as <U>Taverner's
Koans,</U> <U>Spoken War,</U> <U>A Writer's Choice Literary Journal,</U> and <U>PIF Online</U>. 
In June of 1997, Jeff was featured in real audio at the Ann Arbor Poetry Forum, and he is currently
being featured (also in real audio) at Audionet Books.

	I was born and raised in the lower mainland and after a childhood traveling the North American wilderness I gained an affinity for the wonders of nature. This childhood freedom fertilized my imagination turning me towards the arts as a means of helping wildlife. I studied fine arts for several years ending my schooling with a full time classical animation course.

  I am currently working on becoming a full time illustrator/animator with the hope of helping our natural wonders stay beautiful any way possible.

                 others to swat convoluted cobwebs in attics of their own lives. Writing is a private scream
                 with a universal echo that emerges from humble accordions of inner-need.Publication's mop
                 does messy floors, but art does act. It is here we learn what matters most. It is here we
                 unseat demons, take cushions off emotion's couch, and sit before a roaring fire."

 BeechBluff, Tenn. I'm 44 and me and my beloved dog, Bugsy
                 Malone, live on an old rundown farm here in Tennessee. I'm ex-military. I love the outdoors
                 and used to be a big-time hunter, then one day while looking down my rifle sights at a
                 trophy buck, something came over me and I realized that that beautiful animal was just
                 trying to live and make it's way in this world---the same as me! Now I hunt tin cans and
                 paper targets. And I write. I write science fiction---mostly military sci-fi, and tall adventure
                 tales. I spent many years in the Orient so most of my yarns incorporate real-life adventures,
                 places and people that I met during those travels. Believe it or not, many of those
                 adventures were wilder than any yarn I could ever spin.
