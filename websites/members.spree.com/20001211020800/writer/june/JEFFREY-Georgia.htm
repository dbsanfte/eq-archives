	<P>The stars and stripes image of our state flag is not an image which promotes self-pride. It should set forth a message of hate and bigotry to all who view it.  Styled in the traditional stars and bars image of the Confederate army flag, the banner is a disturbing sight to behold.  It represents the fact that Georgia itself has been slow to truly change with the times, holding onto such bigoted views which has fueled America as a whole since the country's earliest beginnings.
</P>
	<P>Throughout my seven years spent in the state of Georgia, I've come to see this state as a true melting pot of various cultures.  We were the state to play host to the world at the 1996 Olympic Games.  Our state capital, Atlanta, prides itself as being "the city too busy to hate."  In more ways than one, Georgia has come a long way in terms of race relations.  But there's still the issue of the flag.
</P>
	<P>After undergoing an assortment of changes since the Revolutionary War years, our present state flag was adopted in 1956.  It was adopted during a time when racism ran rampant throughout the U.S.A.; the flag was created, in my opinion, to put blacks of this time in their "supposed" places.  The banner was used as a deterrent to any African American who wanted to partake in the national rights and liberties granted to all American citizens.  Blacks, at the time, simply weren't allowed to be human beings.  Through the use of the Confederate army emblem, Georgians of the time sent forth the message that grand Ole Dixie was here to stay.
</P>
	<P>Upon viewing the flag for the first time I was deeply confused.  To think that after all those years of spent blood and sacrifice, Georgia's African American community was once more being slapped in its face.  I for one am tired of being slapped with such an affront.
</P>
	<P>When I look at the flag, unlike some misguided and deluded souls, I don't see an issue which can be tossed on the back burner.  No, when I view the state flag flapping freely in the wind, I see a messge of death and oppression, which has taken the form of a piece of multi-colored cloth.
</P>
	<P>Others may argue that there are more important issues to be dealt with at the current time.  They may believe that the flag isn't hurting anyone.  But let's say that the German hierarchy decided to add a little decoration to their country's flag.  Let's say that this little decoration was a swastika.  Of course the world as a whole would be up in arms.  How dare those Germans put forth an image like the swastika, which sets forth the image of death and radical intolerance in all its many forms! we would ask.  I don't see how the Georgia flag should be treated any differently because, in essence, the flag embodies the same message.
</P>
	<P>To put it simply, Georgia's blemish must be cleansed.
