	<P>Today we're going to talk about dating. Whaaaat a spinster talking about 
dating? Yes dating! When was the last time you dated yourself? If you're like 
many women you don't step one foot out on Saturday night without a date. 
That's really sad when you think about it. I can remember when I was sixteen 
years old my friends and I would stay home on the weekend when we were 
dateless. It was very important to not be seen out and about alone. 
</P>
<P>The only times it were safe to be seen without a boyfriend during the weekend 
was when all the "dateless" girls gathered. Yep, we were a "pack" of giggly 
girls searching for potential boyfriends everywhere we went. Mind you, I had 
some of the best times as a teenager with my "pack" of  "dateless" friends. 
That was then and this is now. Well it's time to let go of the mentality we 
need someone at our side in order to enjoy our hard earned weekends. After 
working forty or more hours per week our weekends should be carefree and 
restful. </P>

<P>We're now mature, vibrant, and fun loving women who don't need someone to 
hold our hands before we will allow ourselves to experience the pleasure of 
our own company.  So you don't know how to date yourself? Let me tell you 
about my dates, yeeessss with myself. My ideal date would start with a long 
pampering bath in some of the best smelling gardenia bubble bath on the 
market. On date days I usually feel ultra feminine so I dress accordingly.  I 
don't take any shortcuts when dressing for a date with myself. If it took me 
an hour and a half to dress for a man it would most certainly take me two 
hours for myself.</P>  

<P>Yes I do primp and spin in front of the mirror. Why? I want to look DELICIOUS 
to myself. Ok I'm a bit weird but lets not stray from the theme of this 
article. Next, the evening starts with me attending a play, usually a comedy. 
I prefer comedies because I spend my days being serious and could use some 
hearty laughs by the weekend. Afterwards, I would stop at a nice sit down 
restaurant. My restaurant choices depends on what I feel like eating at that 
moment. Chili's, Bennigan's, Ruth's Seafood, or Bonnie's Steak House one of 
Houston's best steak restaurants. No McDonald's or drive thrus for me on this 
night. Why? </P>

<P>It wouldn't be something I would tolerate on a "real" date with a man so why 
should I settle when dating myself? The key to dating yourself is the same as 
if you were dating another person, to have a good time. Don't stress yourself 
with concerns as to who's looking at you or what they must be thinking about 
you dining alone. Relax! Who said you can't have fun by yourself, it sure 
wasn't me. Now I know there has to be another  purpose for this article 
besides dating yourself? </P>

<P>Yes. Our preoccupation with the opinions of others. Dating yourself forces 
you to face those criticisms you think others are making about you. It's when 
you face them you realize it was all in your mind and not what people were 
actually saying. When you can handle your own pessimism about not having a 
mate you'll be able to triumph in dealing with the harsh judgments from 
others. Ask any woman what her ten worst fears would be and being alone in 
public would surely be among them. </P>

<P>So many women are fearful of being without a date they would rank it as a tie 
with having their dresses stuck in their pantyhoses in public. Ladies, take 
chances and experience new things. So what if you have to experience them 
alone. What truly matters is getting the most enriching experiences from life 
that's possible. Don't be the dying person saying what-ifs and should-haves, 
life waits for no one so LIVE NOW!</P>
