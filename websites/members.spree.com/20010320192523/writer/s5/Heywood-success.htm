<P>	How do you measure it? Do you just count $$$$ or pounds or
whatever your currency is? Obviously that's one goal and, to make
enough money to be at least self-sufficient is something we all
desire. But there are many other measures: all part of the long-
term view, which will create a business that will sustain you and
your family not only today, but also for many tomorrows.</P>

<P>I'll admit that I'm still not earning quite enough of whatever
currency, but I certainly do think it an achievement to have paid
my own hefty phone bills and have enough left over for the rent
for the last three months now. Yep, this is the first time in two
years of online work. I'd hate to work out the hourly rate!</P>

<P>I don't want to put anyone off who is new to online business: I
do want to impress upon you that results will be neither magic
nor instant, but results are possible.</P>

<P>So many people want it to happen overnight. It's partly society
and it's partly that they just want to believe -- and when it
does not happen, a vast majority will have given up long before I
began to see results. You have to have tenacity: be like a dog
with a bone. Hang on and keep trying, no matter the odds.</P>

<P>I live in the remotest valley on the north of the island of
Tenerife, just off the African coast. Besides me and my
"technological toy room" that must appear as something from
outer space to the locals -- we had 900 goats and 49 cows on the
last count. It's like stepping back into the 19th Century! Which
all goes to prove that "working the net" really can be done
from absolutely anywhere, by anyone.</P>

<P>The cost of living here is cheap and the scenery inspirational:
that's "richness" to me in itself. For that, I'll put up with the
intermittent nature of Internet connections and electrical
supplies that make it harder for me that most of you in
"civilised locations". But that's what we do this for isn't it?
To escape the 9-5 and all the other drudgery and slavery that
goes with it. It's a great feeling, but it doesn't come on a
plate, unfortunately.</P>

<P>You are impatient, you may even be hungry, but you cannot
shortcut the need to spend time learning the culture, building
your business and your business relationships. The more so if
your line wasn't business before the net. Mine was, with 20+
years as an accountant that has been of enormous help. The
environment and tools may be different, but business is still the
same thing it ever was. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You
still have to be business-like and strive at it to succeed.</P>

<P>I still have a long way to go, but I am happy to be getting
there. On the other hand, you can now take it from me (self-
appointed expert!) that it certainly is possible -- my dad said
it wasn't! You too might have close family and friends who
discourage you. It would be easy to listen to them, to give up.
Don't! Do they know the net? Tell them (respectfully) to go ...</P>

<P>Having got this far, you can be sure that I will not be sitting
back and resting on my laurels. I have some great friends and
associates on the net, some glowing testimonials, have plans for
new products and better things for my business, more joint
ventures ... I've only done that through learning, networking,
making contacts, giving something of value and thinking, not just
of money today, but of the long-term rewards and benefits.</P>

<P>"It is by spending oneself that one becomes rich."
Sarah Bernhardt, 19th century actress</P>
