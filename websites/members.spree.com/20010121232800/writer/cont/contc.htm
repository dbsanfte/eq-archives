	An Artist has a unique vantage point in viewing the world around
                them. As they utilize their palette, they make us see the hidden
                beauty around us. With poetic insight, I see a vision of what the
                world really is, and could be. Each poem reaches into the heart of
                humanity, with inspiration, and echoes a call to all of mankind to
                grow beyond what we ever dreamed was possible. To learn to love, and
                to see the hidden beauty in life. My name is Donald D. Campbell. I
                take the hand of each reader and help them to become part of the
                vision that they uncover.

	Mark G. Carter
	</FONT> <FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00009D" SIZE="-1">
	<img src="http://members.spree.com/writer/cont/markc.jpg" align=right>
	Mr. Carter grew up the San Joaquin Valley in central California. He
began taking trips into the Sierras with his scout troop when he
was twelve years old. 

He served with the U.S. Army from 1963 to 1971, where he discovered
that military camping was interesting, but not necessarily fun.
After the army, he attended two respectable universities, where he
discovered that going to school was fun, but not necessarily
interesting. 

After that he went nuts for a while--driving big trucks
cross-country, moving around without regard for settledowns or
mainstreams. He took jobs as a rookie (unpaid) government
mule-packer, then as a rookie commercial mule-packer, before going
to farrier's school. He worked as a farrier until a mishap with a
draft horse left him unable to bend over for any length of time. 

Happily, the mishap didn't affect his ability to ride, train
horses, or take lengthy back-country trips--for example, along the
Pacific Crest Trail from Howard Prairie, Oregon, to Cedar Grove,
California. Unhappily, after only a few years of this sort of
existential frivolity, getting old made him lazy, so now he writes
more than he rides. He’s currently engaged in a file search for the
several hundred short stories and two novels, which he wrote,
then put into boxes somewhere. He plans to work them up for
publication, if he can find them. 

Mr. Carter now lives in the country in southern Oregon with his
life-partner and trailmate, Christine Negles, his son, Nick, a
mustang mare, two mules, a hinny, and a cat.

I am an elderly professor of electrical engineering in 
Israel. See www.ee.bgu.ac.il/~censor/  choose file cv.zip and
jpg-directory for more detail and images. Hebrew is my primary
language, and English is secondary. Writing poetry is rare and sporadic, in
the sense of "I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up,
nor awake my love, until it pleases": Song of Solomon 8:4. (BTW, the King
James  Version Bible translation putting it as "... until he please" is
wrong-- the Hebrew definitely refers to *love* as the abstract noun. How
they could make this mistake is in the realm of their male chauvinism
combined with religious dogma)<BR><BR>

I work in a primary school in a rural part of England called Lancashire, the town I live
in being called Oswaldtwistle which is green and lush and filled with open spaces. I
attended the University of Hull where I studied English Language and English Literature,
ending with a first class honours degree. I have been writing poetry almost the whole of 
my life, such is the passion for such a venture. I have been published in many webzines
and have had one or two poems published in hard copy, although I hope to make furious at
some point in the not too distant future. I am divorced, the three children of the family
residing with me since my ex-wife has remarried and relocated to Estonia for five years
 because of employment prospects. And then, finally, my favourite poet is Sylvia Plath, the
passion of the language, the raw emotion that seethes through poem after poem, especially the later
ones collected in Ariel and Winter Trees.
