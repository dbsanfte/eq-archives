 <BR>
 <FONT size="+2">  © Kye Eric Covell<BR><FONT size="+1">
<P align=justify>	
	It had taken some digging, some hardcore searching but 
Adrian had finally found it, the perfect gift.  Pride swelled in him as he thought on this; A bitch of an effort to be sure, but what else could he do?  It was for her.  She deserved nothing less.

	<P align=justify>The black VW Beetle rounded the corner onto Belmoore, Adrian would grab a quick shower and change before heading off on the long drive to deliver his present, and if his patience and ability to control his excitement held out, maybe a nice shave too.

<P align=justify>	He rolled into his driveway, threw the bug in park and killed the engine.  Before he entered his home though, a slight paranoia slipped over him and he checked the trunk latch one more time.  He'd not had the Beetle long and he wanted to assure beyond a shadow of a doubt that his gift was safe in it's trunk.
<P align=justify>	"Paranoid much?"  Adrian said with a chuckle as he neared his front door, jangling his keys playfully in his hand.

<P align=justify>	Pierceval was happy to see him, the gray tabby had heard the Bug pull up and was waiting just inside the front door.
<P align=justify>	"Hey Handsome."  Adrian said with a smile as Pierceval crisscrossed between his ankles, brushing his soft fur against them and singing happily.

<P align=justify>	After giving Pierce an appropriate dose of affection, and an equally appropriate dose of food and water, Adrian headed for the shower.  Inside the grey marble-tiled bathroom, Adrian whipped off his black t-shirt and brushed the long brown bangs from his eyes.  After reaching down and starting the water, Adrian stood before the mirror.  He turned his face to the left then the right, inspectingly, then looked to his thin yet defined chest.  He flexed his biceps once before laughing at the silliness of it and heading to his bedroom for a change of clothes.

<P align=justify>	As he passed his bedside table, something caught his eye.  Approaching the answering machine Adrian smiled, in his excitement he had forgotten to check his messages.  There were six.  He pressed the play button and continued to root around in his closet.  After the machine had clicked and whirred, the prerecorded voices of his friends and family came.

<P align=justify>	"Hey, it's Charlie,"  The answering machine began in a pleasant female voice, "Aced the final baby!  Thanks for the notes, you're the man."
<P align=justify>	"I know."  Adrian said with a chuckle.
	<P align=justify>"Gimme a call when ya get in,"  Charlie's voice continued, "Let's hang out tonight."  The familiar beep, click and whirr of the answering machine followed and after that, more familiar voices came.  Les wanted Adrian to know that he'd scored the Creed tickets.  Kaylan, in his usual quiet tones, thanked Adrian for listening to his problems the night before.
<P align=justify>Purple also thanked Adrian, he'd gotten her a job interview and she'd landed the position.  Tim just let out a thunderous belch and laughed while Jackie seemed to wonder how Adrian was feeling.  There was a nice message from his mom in there as well.  But from all of these, the final one caught his attention the most.  He'd finished preparing his clothing by then, and had stopped in mid-tooth brushing to hear the message, then had rewound it and listened to it again, watching the two reels of the minicassette spin as the answering machine delivered her voice.  Lily's voice.
<P align=justify>	"Hey kiddo, I just...I really want to talk to you Adrian."
<P align=justify>	"Soon."  Adrian said with a gentle smile.  He stood there a few seconds, the smile still on his face, before finally returning to the bathroom and his shower.

<P align=justify>	It was dusk now and Adrian hit the Bug's headlamps as he pulled out of the driveway, the sweet smell of his freshly applied cologne thick in the air.  He'd opted to wear her favorite outfit of his, not the most comfortable driving attire, but it was her favorite.  The tight black jeans and the miserably uncomfortable skintight black spandex shirt.  It would be a bearable drive, and he felt like he looked good, in point of fact he knew he did.

<P align=justify>	For the most part the drive was uneventful, except for the hitchhiker.
Actually, the man wasn't hitchhiking but walking, a slight limp hindering the process.  Of course Adrian's first instinct was to stop and offer him a ride, he'd braked and pulled the Bug to the curb before noticing the clock and how incredibly late he was.  What he did next he felt incredibly bad about, after noticing the time he'd panicked a little and sped back onto the highway.  Shit! Adrian thought, How goddammed rude was that Adrian!  He shook his head, "Damn."  Get the guy's hopes up for a ride then split.  Nice. Very nice.

<P align=justify>	Jack Hickock had heard the car approaching, the first he'd heard in nearly ten minutes, he'd seen the brake lights light up and the Bug roll to the side.  He'd quickenned his pace a little out of politeness to his would-be ride.  But when the car sped off seconds later, Jack didn't consider this as rude an action as Adrian had.  Jack had seen his share of jokers pulling over then zooming off at the last minute and knew that the black Beetle wasn't one of them.  The guy'd probably changed his mind out of fear, Jack contended, he'd seen plenty of that as well.  A smart decision in fact, picking up strangers was always a dangerous proposition. Jack pointed to the shrinking taillights in the distance,  "It's the thought that counts, buddy."  He said before turning his attention back to the three more miles 	before him, and the motel bed that awaited.

<P align=justify>	Adrian was still thinking about the limping guy as he approached her building.  He'd made good time since then, he'd taken his chances with the speed limits and come through without incident.  He stood at the bottom of the stairs leading to her building now, the gift tucked safely under his arm.  He climbed the stairs to the second floor and approached her door.  From the window he could see that the apartment was dark inside, he tried the knob.  locked.  Cool.  Adrian thought, he'd beaten her home just as he'd hoped, now the surprise would be perfect.  He knew where the spare key was and let himself in.  Inside, he made his way to her bedroom and lay the gift on the bed, before going into the bathroom to freshen up.  That having been done he returned to her bedroom, sat on the bed and waited.

<P align=justify>	After nearly an hour, Adrian heard the tell tale sounds of her keys outside the front door.  He reached for the gift and placed it in his lap.  She found her way inside, turned on the lights and made her way to the bedroom, Adrian could see her approaching and excitement welled in him.  She was alone, dressed in a nice purple miniskirt that Adrian had never seen but liked.  She carried a bouquet of twelve red longstems in her left hand.  He thought she would head to the kitchen to place the roses in water before heading to the bedroom but she didn't, as she entered and fingered for the light switch Adrian straightened his posture.



<P align=justify>	As the lights came on she noticed him instantly, she double taked at first, then looked through blinking eyes at him,  "Adrian?"  She asked.
<P align=justify>	"Surprise!"  He said, leveling the double barrel at her. Both heavy blue-steel barrels of the gift exploded angrily outward, the recoil kicked him in the shoulder harder than he expexted and Adrian's world became slow motion.  Lily ragdolled backward into the wall, a look of utter shock on her face, and slid downward, framed by the rorshach blottings of blood. Her head struck the drywall plaster with such force that a small dent was left .  The roses fell gently from her hand to the floor as the echo of the blast caused tingly noises in all four corners of the room.

<P align=justify>	Adrian stood very still a moment, then coughed slightly due to the heavy sulfur smoke in the air.  His perfect gift had been received, and she had deserved no less. The gift she had given him was a silent, perfect madness.  One so secret in it's intensity that his many friends and family members had not even suspected it.  He had given her the better part of three years of his life, and they had been happy.  So when he received the late night phone call two weeks before his sanity had begun to tumble.  She'd wanted her freedom, she'd said, and now Adrian had given her the ultimate freedom.  He dropped the shotgun to the floor.  Soon he would hear the sirens, and he would wait for them.  He would have a seat and wait.  He'd done right by her, and if need be, he could wait all night.
