	<STRONG>I.</STRONG><BR>
	<P>In his forty-seventh year, in a small coastal town
south of Portland, Professor Robert Gaines had dreams of Heaven.  A
balding and overweight professor of English literature who insisted
on wearing blue jeans and Tweed jackets to his lectures,  Gaines
was beside himself, for he could not understand how these dreams
could occur. The timing, he thought, was bad.</P>
       <P> Intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually, Bob
Gains  had nearly strangled his capacity to feel remorse over the
commission of any wrong-doing. It's something he'd worked on for
years.</P>
        <P> The movement towards a "constructive sociopathology,"
as he humorously put it to his most intimate friends,  had been a
life-long task.  Since turning away from his grandparents'
Presbyterian church, Gaines had immersed himself in reading works
by the  best minds of the twentieth century.  Angered that he had
been duped into studying  a God that was alternately vengeful and
merciful, he had zealously studied the naturalists under the  now
deceased Professor Walter Wright, and during his
intellectual/spiritual pilgrimage  had been led to accept David
Hume's argument, made two centuries earlier, that miracles could
not occur in a universe governed by natural laws of cause and
effect.  </P>
       <P> As a young pot-smoking Ph. D. from one of the best
California universities, Gaines had embraced the  existential
universe and Sartre's atheism, at one point nearly committing to
heart the original French version of Albert Camus' L'estranger.
A few years later, he had  found Pychon's application of the second
law of thermodynamics-the theory that entropy begins once a body of
energy  reaches critical mass-a suitable replacement for the
Christianity of his  grandparents.  After all, the tendency towards
disintegration meant that chaos was absolute.  Consequently, the
claims that in a universe of shifting signs no belief could have a
basis  rang true as a church bell, and so he had burned into his
heart the premise that any religious construction was an
imaginative tool used to deny the existence of the Void. </P>
        <P>Devoid (therefore) of any conviction in the
forty-seventh year of his life, he had determined to murder his
younger brother Ruben-always the family favorite--and seize the
family wealth.  Any act, Gaines reasoned, was morally equivalent to
all other acts in a universe lacking absolutes; killing a zebra,
for instance, was no worse and no better than frying an egg. "Hats
off to Charley Manson," Gaines had been overhead to say at faculty
parties.  </P>
        <P>He and Ruben had  not liked each other from a very
early age,  but a seemingly small disagreement over  whether to
provide care for their aging grandparents had divided them years
ago, and so Robert Gaines had neither seen nor heard from his
brother for over twenty years.  His mother was dead, his father
teetering on the brink, both his grandparents were gone (Acting out
of no conviction, he had not attended family funerals.), and his
brother believed all good things came from God.  Certainly, Robert
reasoned, Ruben did not deserve to inherit the small fortune that
would be left by the father, at one time a wealthy investment
banker in San Francisco.  Additionally, the very randomness of the
act of murdering his brother appealed tremendously to Gaines; while
Ruben had done nothing to deserve annihilation, the very
senselessness of such a  brutal act  proved to Gaines that it must
be done.</P><BR>
<STRONG>II.</STRONG><BR>
        <P>The dreams of Heaven, therefore,  were
infuriating, particularly since they came  when Robert was
finalizing plans for Ruben's demise. Once the dreams started
Professor Gaines  could not stop thinking about them.
<brk>Perhaps, he reasoned, the dreams were caused by the stress of
murdering his brother; but he felt only pleasure in planning to
extinguish Ruben.    He considered the possibility that he had a
brain disease, but a check-up with his doctor quickly removed that
suspicion.  As far as the possibility that the dreams were of
divine origin-well, to Bob Gaines,  God was out of the question.  </P>
     <P>   Yet, one day, as he was ploughing through the first
book of Paradise Lost in his British Literature class, he found
himself   entertaining the notion that  Milton's writings were
predicated not upon a denial of traditional Christian belief but
upon a  reserved acceptance of  a God who would  throw one of His
own creations out of Heaven.   Upon another occasion, as he read
Donne's Holy Sonnets alone to himself in his small house
overlooking the coast, he found himself moved to tears as images of
the City of God flooded his mind; he thought about his brother
living alone in a cabin in northern California; for an instant, he
even missed his grandparents.  </P> <BR>
<STRONG>III.</STRONG>   <BR>   <P> I must be losing my mind, Bob Gaines told himself
as he sat one late night at the window of the diner overlooking a
small Oregon bay.  He rubbed his sore neck and wondered if he were
catching a cold.</P>
         <P>It was late November.  Waiting for his dessert, he puffed
on his pipe, wondering if he should make an appointment with a
therapist.    The steady rains of the last forty days had abated,
and the small town had been wrapped in thick fog since late
afternoon.  Maybe, he thought, I need to take a good long walk down
the coast, find some attractive promontory, and throw myself
headfirst into the ocean. </P> 
        <P>Later, as he drank his coffee and worked on his cherry
pie,  he thought of how easy it was going to be to have his brother
murdered: because Ruben lived in a cabin in the woods without a
telephone or a computer, Robert planned to hire a killer through a
third party, to whom he would never reveal his identity.  He had
set up the chain of events, as logical as Aquinas' argument for a
Prime Mover, and it would be impossible to trace. Professor Gaines
liked to imagine his brother's final agonizing moments, the rope
pulled tight around the throat by someone three time Ruben's
strength; the pain and suffocation his brother would experience
would be extreme.</P>
       <P> Why, then, the dreams? he kept asking himself as he
rose from the table, walked to the front desk to pay, and exited
the diner. Why these fucking dreams?</P><BR>
<STRONG>IV.</STRONG>      <BR>  <P>The  dreams had begun several weeks before, on the
night marking the fifth year of his divorce from  Helen, who had
moved out with their obese and pimply-faced son Reinhart as soon as
Robert began experiencing severe depression. </P>
      <P>  Gaines remembered that, in the first dream, he had
stood on a promontory  overlooking the   ocean when he had glanced
up into the sky.   As he had stared upward,  he had seen the
darkening blue sky crack like an egg; as the two halves of the sky
pulled away from each other,   another sky, similar to the first,
again cracked like an egg, its two halves pulling apart and
revealing yet a third sky.  In his dream, he had found this
spectacle terrifying yet awe-inspiring.  As he had watched, waiting
for another splitting, he saw the image of a golden city.  It
struck him, even in his dream, as a reflection, like something
glorious seen only through its shadow on water.</P>  
<P>The beauty of the reflected city had overwhelmed him, and he
had heard a distant singing; as he had strained to listen, he knew
that it was the most harmonic, the most moving music he had ever
heard.  The song, in fact, reminded him of a waterfall, an analogy
that during his waking hours would strain his own logical
capacities to the breaking point.  Finally, in this first
dream(which continued over three nights), standing on the turret of
a building near the wall of the city stood a man who resembled his
brother. </P>
<P>When he had awoken from this dream in the middle of the night,
he had felt shaken.  He had forced himself out of bed and gone
downstairs to pour himself a drink and, hopefully, clear his mind
of  delusion.  As he drank into the early morning, he couldn't stop
thinking about Ruben, imagining Ruben kneeling and praying for him.</P>
<P>        "Jesus Fucking  Christ," he muttered to himself again
and again as he put the bottle of Scotch to his lips, hoping the
alcohol would burn away the dream.  As he drank deeply, Robert
tried to force into his mind the picture of his brother gasping for
breath. The thought made his own throat and neck hurt.</P>
 <P>       The next day, following his last class at 3:30 PM,
Gaines hopped in his Toyota and drove to a nude bar in Portland to
escape the images of the City of God that had filled his mind that
day  as he had lectured.  He stayed at the bar until midnight, when
he  met  a dancer.  She had been one of his students several years
before.</P>
     <P>   "I'm very depressed and lonely," he had told the young
woman as she sat next to him at the bar. He rubbed his neck.  Her
stage name was Rose.  He couldn't remember her real name. "Jesus,
I'm lonely. Kind of fucked up, too."</P>
  <P>      "Most people are,"  Rose answered, slow,  pensive.
Gaines wondered if she were working him for a series of lap dances.
"Lonely and fucked up," she added for clarification.</P>
        <P>"I have these dreams at night...," he began, taking a
sip of warm beer, not sure what he was saying.</P> 
<P>        "I have dreams, too," she said, putting her hand
between his legs. Gaines was immediately aroused.</P>
  <P>      "Not like these."  Just for the hell of it, he
explained the dream and found that she was interested.  As she
listened, she massaged him.</P>   
        <P>"Don't bet on it, Professor," she said,  sure of
herself. He squirmed, and she removed her hand.</P>
       <P> "Do you believe in God?" he asked and several minutes
in which the dancer did not go away.   He wasn't sure why he asked.</P>
       <P> "It's not a question you get asked in a place like
this, y'know?" she commented, smiling, and he was sure at that
moment that this woman could have earned no more than a C in his
class. "I mean, the fact I'm now a stripper...?"</P>
        <P>"Just the same...," he began and paused, rubbing his
neck, his throat sore and parched. </P> 
       <P> "Yeah, I do," she said, finally.  " Mama always said,
'Put the damned cards on the table, Elizabeth.'  Anyway, I grew up
Pentecostal.  Hard to forget God, even when I dance. Gave myself to
Jesus when I was fourteen.  Hallelujah and praise the Lord and all
that crap.  Big  mistake."</P>
       <P> What the hell am I doing, Gaines wondered. I mutter some
inane words and this girl, who dances naked and screws for a
living,  launches into fundamentalist theology. </P> 
       <P> "Why a mistake?" Gaines asked.  He  had done something
similar when he was sixteen, just before he got fed up with his
grandparent's church.</P>
        <P>"Because you can't ever get away," Rose said.</P>
<P>        "From what?" Gaines asked. Rose's remark made him
feel, for some reason, as if things were suddenly closing in around
him.</P>
<P>        "Jesus.  God.  What d'you think?  It's like one of
those seals they use in space crafts. Can't break the fuckin'
seal."</P>
       <P> "Jesus," Gaines said, more as a swear word than
anything else.</P>
<P>        "'Fraid so," said Rose. "I need a drink. Several
maybe."</P>
     <P>   Gaines considered pinning this girl down like an
insect onto cardboard and demonstrating his intellectual prowess as
well as her incredible stupidity.   Instead, he bought Rose several
drinks and, half an hour later, he asked her to come home with him.
<brk>V. On the Monday of the third week after the dreams began,
just before he left for work one morning, Rose asked, "What about
those dreams, Bobby Boy?"</P>
   <P>     She had started calling his "Bobby Boy" the very first
night they'd slept together.  He wasn't used to such informality,
but  he liked it. He preferred to call her Rose.</P>
   <P>     "Dreams?" said Gaines, sitting at the breakfast table,
chewing  French toast and drinking coffee.  He was having trouble
swallowing.  "What dreams?"</P>
       <P> "Dreams of heaven, dumb shit.   Of God.  You told me
about them when we met," Rose said him, slurping her orange juice.
She sat across from him. </P>  
<P>        "Oh, those."    Gaines had not dreamed of Heaven for
two weeks.    But now that the question was asked, he did remember
the awful dreams of the last several nights.    In these dreams,
he told her over a breakfast of cold oatmeal, he had found himself
wandering alone, endlessly, through a maze of darkened hallways,
searching for his brother and Rose. The hallways smelled smoky,
made him think of smoldering flesh,  and he sensed the presence of
snakes and bats.</P>
        <P>"These dreams scare the hell out of me, Rose," he
said, feeling suddenly helpless. "I wonder if in these dreams I am
in Hell."</P>
      <P>  She reached across the table and took her hands in
his. Looking into his eyes, she said, "They're only dreams, Bobby
Boy. But y'might be in Hell. Y'never know."</P>
        <P>"That's what I keep thinking," he mumbled.</P>
      <P> That very night Professor Gaines dreamed again that he
was standing on the promontory overlooking the ocean, gazing into
an infinite sky, at the center of which stood a city.  The  golden
city occupied the entire sky, and as he studied the buildings, he
noticed that each structure contained colorful etchings that wove
themselves into intricate arabesques and, from there, that each
arabesque was connected to others in  one splendid, eternal design.
If you looked at part of the design, you might get the impression
of chaos; if you  considered the whole, you were struck with the
orderliness of all things.</P> 
      <P>  Overcome by beauty, he wanted to touch the buildings,
their designs, to study the larger patterns that they formed
together.  In his dream, he felt as well in the presence of someone
greater than  himself.  And, as in the other dream, he heard the
singing, constant, eternal, incredibly beautiful and pictured
within his mind, within the dream, a host of angels. Within the
dream, he envisioned a choir of angels, his thin and bespectacled
brother Ruben standing in their midst, singing joyfully.</P>
   <P>     He awoke from this dream at 4:30 and decided to dress
for class and stay up for the rest of the night.  As he walked
downstairs to the kitchen to pour himself a drink, he couldn't
erase the images from the dream. The dream within the dream-the
vision of Ruben-was unnerving.  Massaging his neck,  he decided to
turn his thoughts to his brother's murder.  After all, this would
be the day that he would make the contact that should end,  two or
three weeks later, in his brother's death. </P>
<P>       It was just as he was tipping the new bottle of Scotch
that Rose came into the kitchen.  It was 7:30, and Gaines seemed
distant, almost crazed to her as she cooked his  bacon and eggs.  </P>
      <P> Then she slowly turned to look at him.  "I had a
dream, Bobby Boy, you wouldn't believe."</P>
       <P> Gaines looked up from his coffee, broke into a cold
sweat.  "What? Tell me."  He had to know.</P>
      <P>  "You got a brother, right?  Well, in this dream, you
take him out into some old vacant lot and, as he kneels, you bash
his head in with an aluminum bat. Pretty fuckin' bloody."  </P>
     <P>   Robert nearly choked on his coffee but said nothing.
He  felt that he had been caught and envisioned, for a second,
himself standing condemned before  the throne of God.</P>
       <P>"That it?" he asked, hoping to take the conversation
anywhere else.</P>
      <P>  "Nope.".</P>
       <P> "What?" he said.  "What?  What?"</P>
<P>        "At the end of the dream? Well, Professor," she
paused, looked around the room, sipped coffee, "a rope is put
around your neck and you are hanged until dead.  Very fucking
dead."</P>
  <P>      Gaines rose from the table, picked up his brief case,
and headed for the door. "I'll be home at three," he said, closing
the door behind him. </P><BR>
<STRONG>VII.</STRONG><BR>       <P>In his dreams during the next two weeks, the
professor once again found himself wandering an endless maze of
darkened halls.    He could hear cries and moans coming from behind
the locked doors, and  he  became aware that someone following him.</P>

<P>Whoever it was gave him chills, and as he struggled to wake
up, he found that he could not break his slumber and so he spent
the night in his dreams wandering  dark passages, sensing the
presence of something truly evil on his back, wondering what had
happened to Rose and Ruben. He thought he could hear his brother's
voice calling to him, but the doors to the hallways would not open.
He looked for Rose to ask her for advice, but couldn't remember
where she had gone. Just before he woke, he saw a hangman's gallows
at the end of the corridor.</P>
<P>        Then,  two weeks and a day after the last series of
celestial dreams, having been informed that afternoon that his
brother's decapitated body had been found stuffed into a mine
shaft, he dreamed of a huge, towering mountain covered with forest.
Out of the top of the mountain flowed a stream, whose waters ran
downwards, covering the mountain side with  creeks, rivers, pools,
and lakes.     The water would always run over, around, or maybe
even through the impediment, whether in the form of a fallen tree
or a boulder, and make its way down the mountain. For three
successive nights, he had this dream.   </P>
<P>He knew, too, that the water flowing out of the top of the
mountain was the grace of God and that the streams of water, by the
time they reached the bottom, had criss-crossed and formed a single
intricate design that recalled to him, as he dreamt, the buildings
and their designs he had seen weeks before.  By the third night,
the presence of the being standing near him filled him with joy,
and looking at the mountain he saw his brother standing near the
mouth of a cave, waving to him. Desperate, sensing that he and not
Ruben was in terrible  danger, Robert reached for his brother, knew
that not in a billion years would he ever traverse the space
separating them.</P>  
       <P> In the dream, his throat hurt terribly; it  felt
parched and swollen, and he wished his brother would give him drink
of water.  Suddenly, he realized he hung from a noose suspended
from a gallows.</P>
<P>        When he awoke with a jerk at five in the morning, he
got out of bed and frantically stumbled into the kitchen.   He felt
dead inside, and depression hung upon him like a heavy cloak.   He
hated these dreams of Heaven. He noticed that his hands shook and
he felt sick to his stomach. As he tried to force the dream out of
his mind, he made himself some strong coffee mixed with alcohol.
He thought about mixing in some strong anti-depressants.  Slurping
coffee, he fought to extinguish the growing flame of remorse over
having Ruben killed. </P>
     <P>   Where the hell did this guilt come from? he asked
himself. With the return of the depression that he thought had fled
with his wife and son, Gaines felt bound forever to the pain of
having killed his brother.   The more he fought it, the stronger
the remorse grew.  Finally, Robert Gaines set the cup down on the
table, buried his head in his hands, and  silently wept.    He wept
because he couldn't stop the dreams and because he figured that if
God did exist He was communicating through the dreams.  He wept for
his brother, whom he suddenly missed.</P>
        <P>Rose found him sobbing as she entered the kitchen. </P>
    <P>    "What's the matter, honey?"  Rose was dressed only in
a Seattle Mariners sweater. Sensing crisis, she walked  over to
him, put her arms around him, and held him like a baby.</P>
       <P> "What it is, punkin?"  She  had never called him
"Punkin" before.  It was a name his mother had used on him and
Ruben. He felt himself melting inside.</P>
       <P> He didn't answer, fighting to control himself. He
wished he were dead.</P>
<P>       "Hey," she said, turning his head towards her, "ya
gotta tell me, Punkin.  I'm the only one you got."</P>
       <P> He hesitated.  His brother gone, his grandparents
having passed long ago,  his father barely hanging on, his
colleagues always distant with him, he sensed an overwhelming need
to confess.  This isn't the goddamned middle ages, and I don't have
anything to confess, he thought.</P>
      <P>  "I had my brother killed."  The words poured out of
him in a rattle that Rose had only heard from a dying aunt years
ago.  "I murdered my brother, Rose."</P>
       <P> Rose held him then ever more tightly, kissed him on
the forehead, and stroked his hair. Still sobbing and trembling, he
was glad she was there. Then, as he gradually got a hold of
himself, he told her the story:  how he had gone through an
acquaintance of a local attorney to contact a guy in northern
California that made a living hiring killers; how when he learned
that his brother's body had been found in an old mine shaft he had
lost his lunch; how he had seen his brother waving to him in
dreams;   how in last night's dream he had been a hanged man
watching his brother wave from the Kingdom of Heaven.</P>
     <P>   Rose sat and listened, drinking coffee,  showing
occasional surprise but never seeming shocked that she had been
living with a murderer. </P> 
    <P>    "So what you gonna do?" Rose asked gently, patiently
as Gaines came to the end of his story.  "What you gonna do, Bobby?
What're we gonna do?"</P>
       <P> It had never occurred to him that Rose considered
their relationship as anything but temporary. And he knew then that
he needed her.</P> 
        <P>"I don't know," he answered.  "I think I'm not a
suspect.  Cops never called."</P>
       <P> "A positive sign.  But what  you gonna do is what I
asked you. What we gonna do?"</P>
        <P>What you gonna do?  The words stuck in his head,
flashing on and off like an advertisement, and he knew his life
depended upon the answer.  He felt incapable of giving an answer.</P>
        <P>"Like I said, Rose, I haven't the foggiest. Turn
myself in and wind up going to prison? No thanks.  Maybe even get
the death penalty.  Nothing I can do. Except wait and maybe pray."
As soon as he spoke, he knew he had used the wrong words.</P>
        <P>"What?" she said, squinting as if looking into a
bright light. "What'd you say?"</P>
       <P> "Maybe pray?  I think I said that."</P>
      <P> "Pray?" she'd never heard him used that word before.
"You pray?"</P>
       <P> "Yeah," he said, sighing and rubbing the sides of his
forehead with both hands. "That's about all I can do.  And I don't
even know how to do that any more."</P>
       <P> "Y'don't know how to pray?" Rose said. "Grew up in the
church and don't know how to pray?"</P>
        <P>"Been a long time, Rose.  Too long," he said, wishing
that he could pray.</P>
        <P>He looked at Rose, who smiled. And then this woman who
had likely been a mediocre student surprised him.</P>
        <P>"Let me show you," Rose said in a voice so soft and
sweet that he was reminded of the picture of an angel that had hung
on the wall of his grandparents' bedroom.  "Lemme show you how to
pray. "</P>
        <P>"What?" Gaines began, unsure how to take this offer.
No one had prayed for him or with him for a long time.   </P>
        <P>"I'll pray," she said, looking him in the eyes and
then reaching across the table and taking one of his hands into
hers.  She closed her eyes and bowed her head. "Close your eyes and
bow your head, Professor," she said in a soothing tone. He did as
she told him.</P>
       <P> As Rose began, Professor Robert Gaines found himself
hoping that God was real.  As he listened to Rose's passionate
prayer, his mind began to form images: first, of birds flying over
the ocean;  next, of a man preaching to thousands along the lake
that Bob Gaines  figured was  Galilee; finally, of an enormous
field of rich green grass and flowers of all colors buffeted by a
wind that blew gently.</P>
       <P> "Jesus Christ," he breathed, and as he uttered the
words he saw the Man of Sorrows hanging bloody on the cross, the
clouds behind Him black as night.  It was as if, with his eyes
closed, Rose muttering a prayer he was no longer listening to, he
was standing at the foot the cross. He could feel the hard parched
soil under his feet, hear the weeping of women near him, feel the
presence of something magnificent sweeping with the wind over the
landscape.  
Gazing up at the cross, he saw the man's eyes closed, realized the
man hanging from the cross was dead, noted that a crown of thorns
woven around this man's head.  </P>
<P>Sick at heart, Professor Robert Gaines knew the man hanging on
the cross had died for him; he reasoned in his vision that if he,
Robert Gaines, could be transported to the foot of the cross, that
if the dead man hanging on the cross was who scriptures claimed He
was, then it was a certainty that the bloodied, hanging man  could
rise from the dead.  Yet, try as he might, he could not plead in
his heart for forgiveness  and thereby receive the assurance that
he had been cleansed of all unrighteousness. It occurred to the
Professor, even in his dream, that he had murdered his own soul.</P>
       <P> When he opened his eyes, he looked  at Rose.  As he
stared, the sense of the vision slowly faded, and felt himself
struggling with depression.</P>
      <P> "What?" she asked, and he wondered how she couldn't
know. "What happened?  I heard you say 'Jesus Christ.' What
happened?"</P>
       <P> Gaines looked at Rose, realized she still held his
hand.  Saying nothing, he forced a smile,   and then rose from the
table.   </P>
       <P>"I dunno.  Jesus, I just don't know," he finally said,
barely audible, images from the vision rapidly disintegrating as he
moved away from Rose.  He stood in the doorway between the kitchen
and the family room.  "Everything seems gray."  </P>     
<P>As he remembered seeing his brother waving to him in his
dreams, Robert Gaines walked into the family room and over to the
phone.  Sitting down in his black leather chair, he reached under
the table, grabbed the phone book, put the book on the coffee table
in front of him, and found the number he wanted. He started to dial
his lawyer and then slammed down the phone. </P>
<P>What the hell am I doing? he asked himself, wrapping the phone
chord around his hand and wrist several times.  What in the hell am
I doing? He glanced at Rose, who studied him.  His lawyer had been
the one who had made the contacts that had resulted in his
brother's murder.  Besides, he knew confession would ruin his
professional life. </P>
<P>That night in bed, as he struggled to  sleep, he thought about
the imperatives seemingly attached to the "vision"; accepting
responsibility for the murder entailed confession, and confession
was unthinkable.  </P>
<P>The image of the cross seemed more distant by the second,
almost as if it were pulling away from him.   He had said nothing
about the "vision" to Rose, who slept next to him;  while the scene
had seemed real,   he found himself now convinced that he had
become delusional in the months leading up to and following his
brother's murder.  Quite clearly, he was marginally psychotic.</P>
   <P> Then, with the suddenness of fire, he knew what he must
do.  The dreams, in fact, had made his only alternative quite
clear. </P>
<P>Gently sliding out of bed so as not to wake Rose, Professor
Gaines crept downstairs and walked to the kitchen. There, he stood
several minutes wondering if he should drink. Fearing that in a
state of mild inebriation he would not be able to bring this period
of his life to an effective close, he turned off the house alarm,
opened the door to the garage just off the kitchen.</P> 
<P>Standing on the concrete floor in his bare feet, enveloped in
darkness, he wondered for a second what he was doing.  Then,
flipping on the light, he strode to the cabinet that he had built
against the far wall years ago,   reached up over the cabinet, and
grabbed the thick rope  coiled around a nail.   He paused long
enough to make a  simple but very solid noose.  </P>
<P>Next, he walked to the aluminum step-ladder kept at the back
of the garage behind the garbage can, and seized it with his free
hand. Carrying rope in one hand and the ladder in the other, he
walked to the middle of the garage, to a point between his work
bench and his car, positioned and opened the ladder, climbed, and
threw the rope over the beam.  Next, climbing down, he walked the
three short feet to the work bench, where he secured the rope
around the middle leg, making sure that the noose dangled a perfect
distance from the beam.  This rope will hold, he told himself. The
rope would hold since the bench had been built into the wall. </P>
     <P> Everything set for take-off, he considered going inside and
drinking a fifth of whiskey to toast his journey.  Thirst can wait,
he told himself, slowly mounting the ladder, grabbing and yanking
on the noose to make sure it would hold.</P>
     <P>Then, half expecting to see Rose open the door leading to the
garage, trying to remember the vision he had seen earlier that
evening, he put the noose around his neck, tightened it,  took a
deep breath and in one motion stepped off and kicked away the small
ladder.  </P>
      <P>Now let's see what happens, Gaines said to himself as he felt
his neck crack and the light of life slowly extinguish.  Wondering
if dead men dream, he hoped his brother could forgive him.
