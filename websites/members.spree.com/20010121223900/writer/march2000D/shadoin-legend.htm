CLEM AND THE MAKING OF A LEGEND<FONT size="+2"><BR>

                       
    ©  Phillip Shadoin
<FONT size="+1">
<P align=justify>
Long before the Perfesser made his historic debut in Rock Creek, there
was the Legend of the King.  And before there was event that created the
Legend of the King, there was Clem.  And immediately prior to Clem,
there was Clem's father, Tom Warden.  Tom was a great bear of a man, who
after World War two, built a fine business in Feed and Seed on the
strength of his hard work and the dependability of his word.
<P align=justify>
Tom spent his war years in the Philippines driving heavy equipment
through jungle islands to carve out airstrips for the United States
Navy.  He had been shot twice while operating his bulldozer.  The first
time the bullet grazed the back of his right hand and put a hole in the
toe of his left boot.  He didn't even know he had been shot, and had the
darndest time trying to figure out what scratched the back of his hand.
It wasn't until later that he discovered the part of his boot missing
that he finally put it together.  When he reported it to his CO, the
Marines were called upon to ride shotgun for all the operators to keep
this near tragedy from recurring.
<P align=justify>
The second time he was shot, the Marine riding shotgun was the trigger
man.  The jungle is rough terrain and the Marine was a little antsy.  So
much so that he kept his finger too close to the trigger.  The bullet
from the M-1 entered Tom's shoulder behind the bone and left in nearly
the same place on the other side.  For Tom the War to End All Wars was
over.  He recuperated in Subic Bay and Honolulu and then San Francisco.
From San Francisco he was sent up into Oregon to train new recruits on
the proper handling of heavy equipment.  The most important thing he
reminded them, is to make sure your shotgun man is riding with his
weapon pointed outward.
<P align=justify>
Tom Warden and Judy Guerber were married on June 3, 1947.  A year later,
Clem was born and with him, perhaps the most important fishing legacy of
Rock Creek.  By 1951, Clem and Tom were regular fixtures mornings and
evenings along much of the Rock Creek. Clem was all of three years old
and already he was casting a four foot split ash fly rod fashioned by
Tom's loving hands.  Whatever Tom did, Clem emulated.  Though Tom was
not thrilled by killing, he taught his growing son all manner of
woodcraft, hunting and trapping.  Clem was versed in conservation and
respect long before it was cause celebre.  The two Wardens would often
disappear for the night, carrying only a canteen and canned goods.  They
had fashioned themselves a lean-to of sorts and there they slept in Army
Surplus sleeping bags and ate trout and beans and chased it with fried
potatoes and Rock Creek water.  Tom might bring along a radio and the
two would listen to a ball game carried to them from as far away as
Chicago or Cleveland by the vagaries of the upper atmosphere.  Life was
simple, punctuated by the changing of the seasons and unfettered by the
routine of school.  By the time Clem was in kindergarten, there were few
fishermen that could catch more fish than Clem Warden, but Tom Warden
was one.
<P align=justify>
Clem's school years were a blur of sports, fishing, studies, friends and
work.  The Warden's were like all families in Rock Creek:  hard working,
God fearing, dependable and solid.  As Clem grew, his status as the
Creek's finest angler was largely decided by word of mouth and deed.  No
one in town brags upon themselves or their kin, but they will grin and
look down while you do it for them.  So it was upon Clem's friends and
the friends of his father to put out the word that if you were serious
about angling, you'd better go fishing with young Clem Warden.  Since
Clem fished everyday, most days mornings and evenings, he often found
himself fishing alone.  Everybody wanted to see for themselves if Clem
was for real, yet few wanted to fish more than once or twice with him.
Clem was pretty convincing in his first demonstration.  So he wandered
up and down the creek working each riffle and rapid, testing each drop
and cut.  There was only one pool that eluded his skill.  It was below
the old mill that had thrived only briefly in the thirties before being
washed out and shuttered for good.  The only way to reach this pool was
to walk in the stream itself, generally mucking things up for all the
down streamers.    So Clem decided to fish it only on days when he knew
other anglers wouldn't be out.  That meant only on days when it was
terrible weather for fishing.
<P align=justify>
It was one day such as this that Clem discovered the King.  Clem was
working a late season nymph and having some success with a half sidearm
cast beneath the overgrowth.  This pool was deep and clear and dark.  So
dark that even in good light, you couldn't make out the details
clearly.  But on this day, there was a heavy mist and a deep fog and the
visibility was quite poor.
<P align=justify>
Clem felt the strike before he saw it.  The initial indication was that
this was a Trout of Notable Quality.  This kind of fish comes along only
once in an angler's life, and only then if he's lucky and persistent.
Clem fought this great beast for more than an hour, with the trout
neither gaining ground nor surrendering it.  Finally, with a furious
twist of his large head, the fish was gone.  After a brief rest, Clem
tied another fly on and went back to work, never to get this big bugger
to rise again.
<P align=justify>
A change came over Clem.  He fished this one pool only, and not only on
bad days.  Finally Tom Warden was made aware of Clem's single-mindedness
by some upset anglers who couldn't fish any lower pools because Clem's
boots were cascading mud down the stream.  Tom and Clem had words, not
harsh ones, but words that made it clear to Clem that his pursuit of
this fish was beginning to have an effect on others and it was his
responsibility to treat the waters with respect in regards to other
fishermen.
<P align=justify>
Clem altered his routine.  Finally out of frustration, Clem grabbed the
porcelain fixture his dad had just removed from the feed store lavatory
and hurled it deep into the pool, as deep as he could heave it.
<P align=justify>
"You act like you are the King of All Trout!  Here's a &@##@^ throne!"
<P align=justify>
And with that epithet, the Legend of the King was born. Clem put his rod
away and for several months never ventured back to the Rock Creek.  Sure
he fished, just not there.
<P align=justify>
Clem was busy at the time being a teenager, playing sports and
discovering the fairer sex.  Clem married his sweetheart Karen Gustafson
and built her a house with his own sweat and toil.  When Tom Warden
retired, it was Clem's feed store to run.  Clem and Karen Warden had
three children of their own.  His oldest son, Tom, became a Peace Corp
volunteer out of college and died of malaria in Micronesia.  His second
child, a daughter, married a man named Gates and moved to Washington
State, where he is doing pretty well.  His youngest son is in medical
school, having done his undergraduate work at the state university down
in the state capitol.<P align=justify>
Clem might have had only had three children of his own, but he like his
father before him, was dedicated to all the children of Rock Creek. His
was a good life and a successful one, though it was one marked by
tragedy and triumph.
<P align=justify>
Until the Perfesser came to town some years later, Clem never again
ventured down to the water that had become known as the Throne Pool.
Other anglers did and they all came back with tales of woe and defeat.
And it was little consolation to Clem when the King was finally caught
by the Perfesser and his true royalty was revealed.  But that's another
story.
