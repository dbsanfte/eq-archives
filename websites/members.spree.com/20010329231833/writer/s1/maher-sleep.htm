	Decline in Deep Sleep Causes Men to Age Faster</U><BR>

<P>Men as young as 35 are already showing their age, according to a new study finding that changing sleep patterns in midlife could be costing men as much as 75 percent of a hormone known to prevent aging, namely growth hormone.
</P>
<P>Previous studies have focused on growth hormone deficiencies in older men and women. Low growth hormone, low testosterone (in males) and high insulin are all associated with increased central obesity (pot belly), loss of muscle mass and reduced exercise capacity. The ratio of the waist to the hip is a basic health and longevity biomarker, excellent being 8 to 10 ratio. But finding that human growth hormone (Hgh) decrease starts when men are in their 30s was unexpected, says Eve Van Cauter, professor of medicine at the University of Chicago and lead author of the study. 
</P>
<P>"When drug intervention targets older adults, that usually means over 65 years. The age range 35-50 is therefore younger that what is considered the entry into old age," says Van Cauter. 
</P>
<P>The results of the study appear in the Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>The study involved 149 healthy men, ages 16 to 83, none of whom had a history of sleep disorders or took medications. Researchers mapped the chronology of age-related changes in sleep duration and found that the first stage of declining sleep quality hits men between the ages of 25 and 45! 
</P>
<P>Although total sleep time remained constant as men moved into midlife, the proportion of time spent in deep sleep declined from 20 percent for men under 25 to less than 5 percent for those over 35! 
</P>
<P>At the same time their amount of growth hormone, which is secreted primarily during deep sleep, declined by about 75 percent! 
</P>
<U>Hormone Therapy for Younger Men? </U><BR>

<P>This study suggests that growth-hormone replacement therapy should be considered for younger men. 
</P>
<P>Dr. Hyman Ryback, a White Plains, N.Y., otolaryngologist who treats patients with sleep disorders, agrees with Van Cauter's findings about the deterioration of sleep quality as men age. 
</P>
<P>"I can't confirm those numbers, but I see a lot of patients and can confirm a lack of sleep as men get older." 
</P>
<P>But he would be skeptical about jumping into growth hormone replacement (injection) therapy. 
</P>
<P>"There's a lot of controversy about it. It's supposed to be a fountain of youth for men, make muscles bigger, help with 'male menopause' -- but no one really knows." 
</P>
<P>Van Cauter has not conducted sleep/hormone studies with women because their sleep quality is affected by a variety of other factors including menstrual cycles, hot flashes and hormone replacement therapy. (However,the phenomena is likely similar.)
</P>
<P>Also studied by researchers was the second stage of deterioration of sleep due to aging, which occurs after age 50, Van Cauter says. Total sleep time begins to decrease by about 27 minutes for each decade into the 80s, and men experience more frequent night-time awakenings and a significant reduction in rapid eye movement (REM), or dream sleep. 
</P>
<P>(Deep sleep and REM sleep are considered different categories of sleep, according to experts, identified by different brain waves and, of course, rapid eye movement.) 
</P>
<P>A decrease in REM sleep appears to be associated with elevated levels of cortisol, a stress-related hormone that heightens attention and alertness. Cortisol levels normally peak in the mornings and decline to low levels at night, matching a person's sleep patterns, but those with decreased REM sleep appear to have higher cortisol levels at night. 
</P>
<P>"Our data support the concept that decreased sleep quality contributes to the wear and tear resulting from over-activity of the stress-responsive systems," Van Cauter says. 
</P>
<P>The news of the role of cortisol in sleep is not new, says Ryback. 
</P>
<P>"People have different cortisol levels that peak at different times -- you know the stories of early risers, late risers, night owls," he says. 
</P>
<P>It's not enough to get enough sleep. Now you have to get enough of the right kind of sleep. That means deep sleep, which supports growth hormone release and the repair and regeneration which naturally follows.
</P>
<U>Sleep and Health, Intimately Related</U><BR>

<P>An article in the June 3 issue of New Scientist says if you ignore your body's natural clock by working and playing at any time of the day or night, you could set a time bomb for illness, injury and even death, according to sleep experts. The price of ignoring your natural sleep patterns can range from aches and pains obesity, depression, heart disease to chronic fatigue syndrome . A regular bedtime can be as important to your health as stopping smoking or cutting back on saturated fat. Your biological clock, nestled in the hypothalamus region of your brain, controls what time you eat and rest, the rhythmic surge of hormones, changes in body temperature, immune system activity and a host of other body functions. 
</P>
<P>Different people have different sleep patterns. Some are morning people while others are nocturnal creatures. Problems arise when you ignore your natural body rhythms to meet the demands of work or family, says the article. 
</P>
<P>People who restrict their sleep or are engaged in shift work where sleep becomes fragmented and disturbed are at risk for cardiovascular disease. This has been shown in nurses who have been engaged in shift work over a long period of time. They show an increased risk for heart attacks . 
</P>
<P>Sleep debt can also contribute to depression, and lost sleep creates dangers at work and on the roads. Sleep deprivation results in impairment in people's capabilities to operate in their usual, expected way, and they would not necessarily know that they are impaired. 
</P>
<P>Most people require roughly seven to eight hours of sleep a night to stay alert through the day. Warning signs of lack of adequate quality sleep include forgetfulness, irritability, confusion, fatigue, low libido and depression.
</P>
<U>What To Do</U><BR>

<P>Exercise, avoiding caffeine after 12 PM, dark rooms or sleeping masks, white noise, cool bedrooms and hot baths are all helpful. Three different classes of natural products promote sleep. 
</P>
<P>Herbs like valerian, passion flower, hops, kava kava,  and the minerals calcium and magnesium can work for adults of any age. It may take two weeks for the effects to be noticed by some. 
</P>
<P>Melatonin is more indicated the more above 40 you are. Also, night workers, those travelling across time zones, those with high levels of the stress hormone cortisol, and women with hot flashes often do well with melatonin You can actually measure your melatonin levels via online mail order salivary hormone test "Sleep Profile". This helps determine your need.
</P>
<P>5-HTP is the other great natural sleep inducer. It is also an antidepressant, anti-anxiolytic and tends to curb carbohydrate and chocolate craves. Therefore, if your depression is strongly related to poor and difficult sleep, 5-HTP is to be strongly considered.
</P>
<P>If your poor sleep is related to large amounts of anxiety causing stress, worry and tension, and especially if marked by failing memory, consider adding the combination of PS-100 (phosphatidylserine) and DHEA. These  are "nootropics" (smart nutrients) which improve learning and memory, reduce fatty deposits in aging nerve cells (lipofuscin), and even support nerve and memory regeneration while relieving stress caused depression. They also counter the effect of excess cortisol, the "great brain ager". An Adrenal Stress Index (ASI) is a salivary hormone test, again available by on-line mail-order, that will pin-point the supplementation protocol that is best for the stage of stress you are suffering.
</P>
<P>Of course, all men over 40 and every women who has reached the change of life are encouraged to consider Hgh enhancement using safe and affordable hgh secretagogues * as the key hormone enhancement in their anti-aging strategy. 
</P>
<P>So remember, one of the secrets of staying young is to sleep like a baby! And by using the right combination of lifestyle and products above, you can come closer at least.
</P>
<P>* A secretagogue is not hormone replacement therapy. Rather a secretagogue causes your own body to secrete a hormone.
