Since returning to writing a year ago after a fifty-nine year
hiatus I have written seventy-two short stories for E-zines and print
magazines as well as numerous columns and humorous pieces.
Until the demise of the E-zine because of litigation, I wrote "A
Writer’s Life" column for The Quill.
I am currently working on a collection of short stories for publication
early next year.

I was ready to graduate from school, and I had to wait for a few<img src="alex_levy.jpg" align=right>
mandatory classes to be available for me to enroll. 
The concept was simple. I take dance, piano, singing, and poetry.
These are such things I should learn so I can be a well-rounded
person. I could also have my choice in women; they dig a good dancer
and a sensitive poet, right? 
As with many things in life, things never go as planned. I learned the
stupidity of that logic and the value of these classes for myself. 
And ever since, I have found that reading and writing poetry has made
me a better person, a modern day Renaissance man. I can always get the
girls later, right?

D. in Renaissance literature, lives alone and isolated in an old, two-story, decaying inherited house, in the sunny Tampa slums The egregious ugliness of the neighborhood has recently been mitigated by the esthetic activities of the police department. The police have pasted bright yellow and orange posters on each post.  The posters advertise that the location is a shopping mall for drugs and proclaim "no loitering," Thus everybody in the neighborhood jogs while carrying cell phones. 
Duane lives as a stranger and alien, not comprehending the customs, the costumes, or the language, some form of postmodern English.  He has had over 2,000 poems published in over 500 print magazines such as APR, Nation, Literary Review, Black Moon, Bitter Oleander, but is not certain if he has any readers since people rarely read poems in print magazines.  His 14th and latest book of poems is WATCHING  WISTERIA, and can be ordered, see www.vidapublishing.com or call Small Press Distributors, 1-800-869-7553.]

I write poetry with the viewpoint of the ancient world in both my heart and mind. My chosen mindset is that  of the Goddess-based cultures of the Bronze Age to the Iron Age world of the Indo-European Celts. My  poetry is intended for all those who look to Mother Earth and Sister Sky for inspiration regardless of their spiritual bent. As far as my fiction writing goes, it is everywhere. From humorous science fiction and horror  to serious action/adventure and fantasy. I have just started to dabble in mystery fiction. There are too many
     muses to ignore. Finding the time to appease them all can be an arduous task. I am mostly Celt by blood   and by creed. My family is of both Scottish/Pictish and Breton stock. I am supposed to have this crazy uncle who was born on the Isle of Man and had his ear torn off in a pub fight in London, but I have yet to verify  this. My family also has a smidgen of Welsh and a touch of German in us as well. To all my Welsh soulmates  out there, "Ysdryd Tracwyddol y Keltiad Yddraic Coch Ddyrg Cychwyn!" I am a member of the Academy of
     American Poets, the Science Fiction Poetry Association, the British Science Fiction Association, the National
     Writers Association, the Horror Writers Association and the Science Fiction Club Deutschland. I have had 84
     short stories and poems published in 17 countries and translated into 12 languages. Publication credits  include: V<I>ermont Living Magazine, The Zone (United Kingdom), Antipodean Science Fiction (Australia),  Planet Magazine, Solar X Science Fiction Magazine (Germany), Fahrenheit Magazine (Poland),
     AlthernaTerra SF (Romania), Via Galactica (Croatia), Nocturnal Ecstasy Vampire Coven Journal, The Harrow, Monochrom SF Magazine (Austria), Amberzine/Amber Stories (Czech Republic/Slovakia), FrightNet,  Mobius; The Journal of Social Change, The Mentor (Australia), Ygdrasil, A Journal of Poetic Arts (Canada),  imelod (Canada), Ghastly Magazine, Illya's Honey Quarterly Journal, The Nocturnal Lyric; Journal of the
     Bizarre, and The Phoenix; International Journal of Heart and Spirit (Canary Islands/Spain)</I>. I hold B.A. and  M.S. degrees and I am a graduate of the London School of Journalism. I am currently attempting to earn my  Ph.D.
