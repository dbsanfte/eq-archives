<P align=justify>
	A flat. A window with the landscape of a modern city on the backstage. A clock hangs at the edge of the stage so that the audience may see the back of the clock. Enters Woman Of 50. Her hair is grey, her gown is old-fashioned. She approaches to the edge of the stage and looks as if into the mirror. She touches the wrinkles of her face.
<P align=justify>

	<FONT color="#FF0000">WOMAN OF 50</FONT> Have I seen it yesterday or is it new one? If it is, I've got one day older. If it isn't, yesterday I wasn't younger than now. Nothing can be better for me. (With despair.) Nothing. (Pause. With abrupt coquetry and relief.) Because even a wrinkle would be a big harm for such a young and pretty woman as I am. (With more coquetry.) I even want to be old and ugly because if I were, wrinkles wouldn't trouble me. If I were... (With despair.) My son... (Moves aside "the mirror" as if leaving. Fast blackout. The  heels of Woman's shoes sound as if she is going upstairs. A door unseen in the dark is opened and closed. The light is gradually back to the maximum. On the backstage - stairs to the gallery of the second floor, a big mirror is downstairs. The clock is on the wall. It doesn't work. Young Man stands downstairs. He has a red belt. Young Man's Girl stands upstairs at the door. Young Man turns around himself and at last looks up.)<P align=justify>
	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN</FONT> Here you are. Come down. (She comes rather loudly. Young Man angrily whispers.) Quiet, he may hear us. (Young Man's Girl starts  going on the tiptoes.) Do you really understand it is necessary to do?
	<P align=justify><FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN'S GIRL</FONT> I don't know why me.
	<P align=justify><FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN</FONT> (with hysteria and humour). Because of similarity.

<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN'S GIRL</FONT> I always knew you see no difference between me and her.
	<P align=justify><FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN</FONT> Not me, but nature does. (Takes a gun from his pocket.) Take it. (Young Man's Girl startles and looks at the gun as if she is hypnotized.)
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN'S GIRL</FONT> No, I can't.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN</FONT> You said nothing like that before, but now you do. How can you say you can't?
	<P align=justify><FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN'S GIRL</FONT> It is sin.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN</FONT> It's sin to do what my mother does.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN'S GIRL</FONT> It's crime.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN</FONT> It won't be crime if nobody sees what we do.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN'S GIRL</FONT> (almost losing her mind). Oh, no...
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN</FONT> Oh, yes, and if you are so weak...
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN'S GIRL</FONT> (being more quiet, but with some fear). ...you'll do it yourself?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN</FONT> What?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN'S GIRL</FONT> You'll kill your mother yourself?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN</FONT>  Your question is not correct. Of course, you may kill yours if you want, but we are not brother and sister.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN'S GIRL</FONT> This nuances are not for me. I have no philosophic education.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN </FONT> You don't need it. (Approaches to her.) Anyhow I love you...
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN'S GIRL</FONT>  And why do you?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN</FONT>   It doesn't matter.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN'S GIRL</FONT>   And when?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN </FONT>  Later.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN'S GIRL</FONT>   And what now?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN</FONT>   Now take it. (Puts the gun into her hand; the pause.)
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN'S GIRL</FONT>   And what if I'm weak?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN</FONT>   So prove you are stronger.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN'S GIRL</FONT> (with irony). Than you are?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN </FONT>  Than she is.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN'S GIRL</FONT>   So what?
	<P align=justify><FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN</FONT>   Then I'll know my love is not a mistake.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN'S GIRL</FONT> (going upstairs as a robot). You haven't said me what her sin is.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN</FONT>   Go.
	(Young Man's Girl goes upstairs. She enters the room and closes the door. A woman's wail and a shot sound. Young Man covers his ears with his hands. Simultaneously with the shot the light is flashing one time and off again. Gradual increase of light. A city park. Bushes and trees. Far noise of cars. Intellectual Man hangs on an oak with his belt, which is fixed as a tail so that he faces the audience.)
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   I think it is not correct to consider similarity as a factor of interaction because two things are different as they are not the same one.
<P align=justify>	(The light is off and on during a moment. Intellectual Man hangs sideways to the audience, and One More hangs on the oak in the same way so they face each other.)   
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT>   Don't you accept the principle of relativity? 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   On the contrary, this principle disables similarity as two things can't be similar just because of relativity of their possible similarity.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT>   How do you refuse similarity if you accept it?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   I accept only relative similarity so I don't accept it at all.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT>  How do you accept similarity if you refuse it?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   Relative similarity is not similar.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT>  Then why do you name it so?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   I must confess I thought about it for a long time, but I haven't come to any exact conclusion.
	<P align=justify>(Non-Intellectual Man enters from behind a bush)
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">NON-INTELLECTUAL MAN </FONT>  Hush! You may scare all girls. (Looks at somebody and hides back.)
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   You see, this maniac has come again.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT>   He is not, and you know it well.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   I just know only that he is not a maniac because he doesn't rape women. But I also know that 
he hides here daily at the same time and reasons it by his attention to another half of mankind, and you should agree that it looks like a mania.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">NON-INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>  (from behind the bush). You better look at yourself, you philosophers!
	<P align=justify>(Intellectual Man and One More look at themselves.)
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   I see nothing new.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT>   Me too.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   We don't have a mirror, but we can look at each other.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT> (to Non-Intellectual Man). You have truly defined our profession.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   But we live here nothing to disturb us.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT>   And nobody.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   And any strange commentaries are completely unnecessary.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">NON-INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT> (from behind the bush). You'll feel them later. 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   He says the same things every day. We shouldn't attend to him. 
 <P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT>   Yes, all the more that you daily say that we shouldn't attend to him. 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>  Yes, all the more that you daily attend to the daily nature of this my offer. 
	<P align=justify><FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE </FONT>  Yes, all the more that...	
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   We better stop here.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT>   As we do it every day.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   As we do it every day. 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">NON-INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>  (from behind the bush). Listen, if you want to hang, you are... (Slow black-out. Light is slowly on with increasing chaos of car hooting. A street bench. A bus faces the audience. Driver's place is empty. The First and Second Women sit inside. They have gloves and hats. The First Woman is thick and small, The Second Woman is thin and tall. Girl With Watch sits so that the audience can see her back only. Sometimes she impatiently looks at her watch. Sleeping Girl sleeps in the bus. She has a small balloon. Long pause.)
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">FIRST WOMAN</FONT>   What a traffic jam!
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">SECOND WOMAN</FONT>   Oh, yes...
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">FIRST WOMAN</FONT>   Sorry, may I ask you?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">SECOND WOMAN</FONT>   You are welcome.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">FIRST WOMAN </FONT>  Where have you bought your nice shoes?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">SECOND WOMAN</FONT>    Oh, I don't know.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">FIRST WOMAN</FONT>   Do you mean you have forgotten?
	<P align=justify><FONT color="#FF0000">SECOND WOMAN</FONT>   I didn't buy them.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">FIRST WOMAN</FONT>   Oh, yes, I see...
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">SECOND WOMAN </FONT>  Do you like them?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">FIRST WOMAN</FONT>   I like the heels first of all.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">SECOND WOMAN </FONT>  I like yours more.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">FIRST WOMAN</FONT>   Let's exchange?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">SECOND WOMAN</FONT>  What a good idea!
	(They exchange their shoes.)
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">FIRST WOMAN</FONT>   How is it?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">SECOND WOMAN</FONT>   It is great, and I like your gloves too! 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">FIRST WOMAN</FONT>   Really? Let's do the same with our gloves.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">SECOND WOMAN</FONT>   You are genius! (They exchange their gloves.)
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">FIRST WOMAN</FONT>   How is it?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">SECOND WOMAN</FONT>   It is great. (Pause.) Your hat... it is... so...
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">FIRST WOMAN</FONT>   Do you like it? Let us do what I want to offer.
	(They take off their hats.)
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">SECOND WOMAN</FONT>  (looking at First Woman's head). Stop!
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">FIRST WOMAN</FONT>   Do you like it too?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">SECOND WOMAN</FONT>   Yeah, yeah, yeah!
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">FIRST WOMAN </FONT>  Just do it!
	(They exchange their hats and wigs. Pause. They gently look at each other.)
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">SECOND WOMAN</FONT>   Your head looks so well in my hat and wig.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">FIRST WOMAN</FONT>   Your feet look so subtle in my shoes.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">SECOND WOMAN</FONT> You are so tall.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">FIRST WOMAN</FONT>   You are so small.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">SECOND WOMAN</FONT>   Thank you.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">FIRST WOMAN </FONT>  Thank you too.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">FIRST WOMAN AND SECOND WOMAN</FONT>  (happily). What a traffic jam!
<P align=justify>	(A running man's steps sound. Black-out. Light. Intellectual Man and One More on the trees.)
	<P align=justify><FONT color="#FF0000">NON-INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>
 (continuing his interrupted speech). ....welcome, but shut up, eh?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>  (neglecting Non-Intellectual Man, to One More). I should note you were wrong to a certain extent.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT>   By the way, you too.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   Really? What do you mean?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT>   No-no, you first.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   You are very nice. But later I'll surely listen to you.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT>   Of course! Nobody and nothing will disturb me not to deprive you of an opportunity to know my opinion.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   If you prove similarity, you shouldn't distinguish between "nobody" and "nothing".
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT>   Why to exaggerate so much?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   Who will need us if we don't?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT>   Who needs us now?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   But what about tasty remains of sandwiches and cakes brought by our old women fans?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT>   They come to sit on these benches and to read detective stories that's why they want us to shut up.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   I shall think on it.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT>   It is nothing to think unlike your recent intention to look at me instead of yourself that completely refuses your refusal of any similarity.  
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">NON-INTELLECTUAL MAN </FONT> (standing from behind the bush). You both are the same for me! (Runs away.)
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT>   You see, he has left again.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   What if he is back?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT>   He will be tomorrow.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN </FONT>  What if he is back today?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE </FONT>  And what?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   And he will try to cease our hanging.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT>   What do you mean?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   To violate the relative balance.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT>   What do you mean?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   To make us to fall down.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT>  Do you mean he will shoot?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   Why not? But you shouldn't be afraid of it as balance is based on similarity which is absolute for you.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT>   But you can't hang as you don't believe.	
<P align=justify><FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN </FONT>  But I said balance is relative. That's why people now hang now fall down.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE  </FONT> We shall throw bananas of syllogisms and coconuts of paradoxes before he can sight. 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   Be closer to the ground, acorns are the only fruit we have.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT>   We shouldn't spent acorns because old women don't come daily. As to balance it is generally eternal. If we fall down, someone will surely... (looking at Non-Intellectual Man coming with a sling) surely...
<P align=justify>	(Non-Intellectual Man slings. Quick blackout. Load gun report. Light is quickly on. The flat of Woman Of 50. The stairs on the backstage. Young Man is ahead squeezing his ears with his hands and waits. He lowers his hands carefully looking at the door. Woman Of 50 opens the door and comes. She throws the gun on the floor. Young Man is horrified.)
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">WOMAN OF 50</FONT>   So what? 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN </FONT>  You've...
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">WOMAN OF 50 </FONT>  I've done it for you.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN</FONT>  (automatically). You've done it for me.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">WOMAN OF 50</FONT>   I only want you to be happy.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN</FONT>   Happy?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">WOMAN OF 50</FONT>   I've done it because you may be happy only with me.
<P align=justify>	(Long pause.)
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN</FONT>   Are you really right?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">WOMAN OF 50</FONT>   Was I ever wrong?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN </FONT>  How could you get it?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">WOMAN OF 50</FONT>   What? The gun?... I am stronger and younger than you think.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN</FONT>   Poor baby...
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">WOMAN OF 50 </FONT>  You had to think on it before.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN</FONT>   It's terrible... Mom, help me...
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">WOMAN OF 50</FONT>   My poor son, come to me. (She wants to embrace him.)
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN</FONT>   Thank you... I didn't know what you are...
<P align=justify>	(Woman Of 50 embracing Young Man with one hand wipes off her make-up - she is Young Man's Girl. She takes a step back, and Young Man is terrified with this transformation. She pushes him, and he falls down.)
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN'S GIRL </FONT>  You didn't know who I am...
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN</FONT>   How... how could you make fun of me so much!
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN'S GIRL</FONT>   Yes, I've made fun of you.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN</FONT>   I was about heart attack.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN'S GIRL</FONT>   Your heart is strong.	
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN</FONT>  (stands up). All's well which ends well. (Trying to embrace Young Man's Girl, but she pushes him again, and he falls down one more time. He stands up.) O.K., you are right, but we musn't lose time, we must hide her...
	<P align=justify><FONT color="#FF0000">YOUNG MAN'S GIRL</FONT>   A good son must bury his mother himself. 
<P align=justify>	(Exits. Pause. Young Man looks up. Long pause. He imitates some previous situations with calm hysteria.) Go. (Goes upstairs instead of Young Man's Girl with an imagined gun in his hand. He can't force himself to open the door, goes down, and expresses his own waiting. Repeats the same several times with the "go" word every time more and more nervously. Being tired he sits down on the floor.) If only someone shot me... (He looks at the gun and startles. He carefully takes it. Impulsively shoots to different sides as if he runs from his own hand so that the audience can see his side or back. One of bullets breaks the mirror. He faces the audience and shoots. A broken glass sounds. Quick blackout. Light is quickly on. The initial decoration of the performance. The window with  the city landscape is broken. He tries to shoot again, but the gun doesn't shoot. He throws gun on the floor and exits. Blackout. Light. The park. Intellectual Man and One More sit on the ground and count their bruises.)
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT>   Hitting the belt. What can I do now?	
<P align=justify><FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT> (looking at his torn belt). What can we do?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT>   What will be tomorrow as this day is not like all the past ours?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN </FONT>  You've just forgotten your past. May be it is a hint  for us to return to civilization.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT>   To civilization?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   I would like to bathe and to change my clothes.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT>   Oh, yes...
	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   You said that balance is eternal, so, by your logic, someone will surely take our place. (A rustle sounds behind them. They turn back. Intellectual Man with hesitation.) It is too fast.	(A red belt is seen behind the foliage, someone hidden by trees hangs it on a bough.)
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT>   What is he doing?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   I have the same question.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">ONE MORE</FONT>   We should ask him.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">INTELLECTUAL MAN</FONT>   I think I know. (Shouts.) Stop it!
<P align=justify>	(Both throw themselves to the supposed suicide. Blackout. Light. The same flat. Stairs on the backstage. Enters Young Man's Girl in Woman Of 50's gown. She indifferently looks at the imagined window with broken glass and at other traces of shots (the mirror and so on). She wipes off her make-up and takes off her wig - it is Woman Of 50. She slowly goes upstairs, enters the room, and closes the door. Quick blackout and light again. The window with broken glass on the backstage. The bus inflated as a balloon appears behind the window. Only its lower part (below windows) is seen.  The bus starts and flies to the horizon so that it is not seen whether something or somebody is inside. Blackout. The bus is on the ground in its initial position. Running man's steps sound. Enters Non-Intellectual Man. He approaches to the bus, opens the driver cabin, takes the sling from under the seat, and runs away.)
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">SECOND WOMAN</FONT>   Your hands are so pretty.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">FIRST WOMAN</FONT>   Let's exchange.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">SECOND WOMAN</FONT>   What do you mean?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">FIRST WOMAN</FONT>   I just mean what I say.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">SECOND WOMAN</FONT>   I didn't even suppose, it would be great, thank you very much!	
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">FIRST WOMAN</FONT>   But...
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">SECOND WOMAN</FONT>   What? Please say, don't shy.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">FIRST WOMAN </FONT>  I would like to be as thin and tall as you are.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">SECOND WOMAN</FONT>   As to me, I am also bored to be as I am.	
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">FIRST WOMAN</FONT>   So let's do it!
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">SECOND WOMAN</FONT>   Great! And don't forget about clothes; my gown will be too narrow for my new body.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">FIRST WOMAN</FONT>   You know, let's exchange everything but heads.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">SECOND WOMAN</FONT>   Did I say you are genius?	
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#FF0000">FIRST WOMAN</FONT>   It seems you did. This traffic jam seems to be long, let's go to that entrance.
<P align=justify>	(Exit both. Girl With Watch stands up, leaves the bus, and faces the audience. It is Young Man's Girl in a gown relevant to her age. She looks at her watch, hesitates forcing herself to make a step in one direction and stopping at once. Several far reports come from the same direction. Sleeping Girl's balloon bursts. Sleeping Girl remains sleeping. Girl With Watch startles and quickly goes in the contrary direction. The bus as if being inflated slowly goes up and flies away. Enter First and Second Women. They have exchanged everything but heads. They look at the flying bus, but are not surprised too much. They look at each other, exit again, and re-enter in 10 seconds as they were at their first appearance of the performance. They look at each other and sit down on a street bench. They start a dialogue identical with their first one. Non-Intellectual Man hiding behind a tree looks at them. Parallel blackout and increase of urban noise to the extent of rattle drowning the speech. At once the rattle is off.)
