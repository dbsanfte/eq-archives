Copyright Information For Print
 Publications<BR><BR><FONT size=3> There seems to be a 
lot of misconception regarding copyright. Some writers mistakenly 
believe that their work is not legally copyrighted until they 
receive notification from the Copyright Office. This simply isn't 
true. Anything that you write is automatically copyrighted the minute
 you place it on paper, or on a floppy disc.<BR><BR> Registration
 will, however, provide you with some added protection. It will allow
 you to collect punitive damages if you are plagiarized. It also
 serves as legal proof of the date of your copyright.<BR><BR>
To register, all you need to do is request the proper form from the 
 Register of Copyrights, Library of Congress, Washington,D.C. 20559.
 Fill it out, enclose a copy of the work you're registering, and send
 them a check for $20.<BR><BR> You can always cut the cost of 
registration by including several different pieces of work under one 
form and one title.<BR><BR>It's always my advice to ask that your 
notice of copyright be added to ANY published version of your work.
<BR><BR><BR>





<FONT size=4><FONT color="#8b0000">Other Rights<BR>
<FONT size=3>Your work could be used in many different ways. As the creator of the
 written work you have full control over how it is used. By agreeing
 to have your work published, you are giving the publisher the right
 to use your work in one or more ways.<BR><BR> One general rule is - 
 the more rights you sign away, the less control you have over your
 work,and the more money you should be paid for the license. Writers
 and editors sometimes define rights in different ways. For
 clarification - see below.<BR><BR> There are cases where editors
 don't take the time to define the rights they are buying. 
<BR><BR> The Copyright Law of  1978 says that usually writers are 
selling one time rights to their work, unless they and the publisher
agree differently in writing.<BR><BR><BR>
<FONT size=4><FONT color="#b22222"><I> FIRST SERIAL RIGHTS</I><BR>
 <FONT size=3> Basically, this means that you, the writer, offer a magazine or a
 newspaper the rights to publish your article, poem, or story, for
 the first time in any periodical. All the other rights remain with
 you. If you want to add a geographical limitation to the license you
 can add a qualifier such as " North American."<BR><BR>
 <FONT size=4><FONT color="#8b4500"><I>ONE TIME RIGHTS</I><BR> <FONT size=3> These are also known as <I> Simultaneous
 Rights. </I> This means that the publisher buys the
 <U>nonexclusive</U> rights to publish the work once, allowing you to
 sell the piece to other publications at the same time. These rights
 are usually used in conjunction with periodicals that do not have 
overlapping audiences.<BR><BR><FONT size=4><FONT color="#0000cd"><I>SECOND SERIAL  (REPRINT) RIGHTS </I>
<BR><FONT size=3> Gives a periodical an opportunity to publish a piece after it
 has appeared elsewhere. These are non-exclusive rights and can be
 licensed to more than one market at a time.<BR><BR><FONT size=4><FONT color="2f454f"><I> ALL RIGHTS 
</I><BR><FONT size=3> If you sell all rights to your work, you give up the right 
to EVER use it again. If you feel that you might try and resell the 
work at a later date, then avoid submitting to such markets, or you 
can refuse payment and withdraw your work. Sometimes editors will
 reassign rights to a writer after a certain time period. It never
 hurts to ask before totally losing the sale.<BR><BR><FONT size=4><FONT color="#008b8b"><I>ELECTRONIC
 RIGHTS </I><BR><FONT size=3>




Your copyright on your original work includes electronic rights.
Sometimes an editor will have both print and on-line ventures, and 
they tend to feel that electronic rights should be extended to them
 as a matter of course when they buy any rights. Most writers don't 
agree. Electronic rights are another part of your bargaining power
 and should not be taken lightly.<BR><BR><BR>
