<BR><P align=justify>
Is that not inspiring?  Essentially, political correctness is a fad that will not stand the test of time.  If you are interested in writing faddish pieces that do not have to stand the test of time, by all means ignore this advice.
<BR><P align=justify>If however, you are hoping to write an enduring classic that will go into its fiftieth printing twenty years after your death, then you might want to listen up.  The rules of twenty years ago or two-hundred years ago regarding gender in written language still apply to the English language.  When referring to a person in the singular, never refer to him as a "their," and, unless you are specifically referring to a specific female, never as a "she," or "her."  It is understood that when referring to a general masculine form, that form is generally all inclusive of every gender.
<BR><P align=justify><FONT color="#004080">The improper use:  "A writer revises carefully because they care about their work."  In this example, in an attempt not to offend any gender, the singular form "writer," is addressed in the plural with "they," and "their."  This is audaciously incorrect.</FONT>
<BR><P align=justify><FONT color="#004080">Another improper use:  "A writer revises carefully because she cares about her work."  Unless this sentence refers to a specific writer who happens to be female, this is a glaring error and a dreadful misuse of the English language.</FONT><BR><P align=justify>
<FONT color="#004080">The politically (in)correct use:  "A writer revises carefully because he or she or it cares about his or her or its work."</FONT><BR><P align=justify>
<FONT color="#008000">A proper alternative (which will heavily bog down your writing):  "A writer revises carefully because he or she cares about his or her work."<BR><P align=justify>
The proper use:  "A writer revises carefully because he cares about his work."</FONT>
<BR><P align=justify>The tried and true proper use reads clean and makes sense.  It is understood (by those who hold our language in esteem and do not look for thousands of ways to find offense) that the masculine pronoun, when used in general, is an inclusive pronoun.  The sentence reads clean, tight, and proper.
<BR><P align=justify><FONT color="#008000">An Alternate Proper Use:  "Writers revise carefully because they care about their work."</FONT><BR><P align=justify>
In this alternative, we essentially take out the mystification of a singular use and refer to everyone in the plural form.  While this treatment works in this example, it may not be what you are attempting to communicate in your work, and it would require you to refer to a very broad and generally plural world.

<BR><P align=justify>Once you have your manuscript in this shape, you can start looking for the more simple problems.  Beginning sentences with conjunctions in the narrative, while technically grammatically correct, is considered a very awkward use of the language.  Here is an example:  "She wanted to get married.  And she felt like the time was right to get married.  But she was not completely sure that he was the right man.  Or, it could be that she had yet to get over her last relationship."
<BR><P align=justify>This paragraph would read much better without the conjunctions at the beginning of each sentence.  This can be accomplished by combining sentences or by simply eliminating the conjunction altogether.  "She wanted to get married, and she felt like the time was right.  She was not completely sure that he was the right man, though.  It could be that she had yet to get over her last relationship."

<BR><P align=justify>Contractions have seeped into the narrative over the last hundred years or so.  Contractions should never appear in the narrative of a formal work.  While suitable for a letter to a friend or as quoted dialogue or text, as a professional writer, contractions tend to make a piece read very informally.  Thus, the reader does not take the work as seriously.  "She didn't have a clue where to go next.  She wasn't sure if she had time.  She knew that they'd wait for her as long as it took, but she'd have liked to have had a few more hours."
Compare that to:  "She did not have a clue where to go next.  She was not sure if she had time.  She knew that they would wait for her as long as it took, but she would have liked to have had a few more hours."

<BR><P align=justify>One of the most challenging things in any writing endeavor is the forms of<FONT color="#FF0000"> "to be," verbs which are: be, being, been, am, are, is, was, and were.</FONT>
The hard-and-fast rule here is very simple.  Forms of the verb to be should<FONT color="#800080"> ONLY </FONT>be used when describing a state of <FONT color="#800080">BEING</FONT> and never used when describing a state of <FONT color="#800080">ACTION</FONT>.  This will make <FONT color="#800080">THE BIGGEST</FONT> difference in your writing style and could be the lynchpin between a sale and a rejection.<BR><P align=justify>
"He was exhausted but he was fighting the feeling.  He was out the door and dashing outside even though it was raining.  Water from the puddles was soaking into his shoes and pants' legs as he was racing for the corner.  He was frantically hailing a cab.  He was really hoping that someone would take pity on him and stop despite the fact that it was raining.  His heart was beating heavily and fast in his chest.  A yellow taxicab was flashing its lights.  He was sighing as it was pulling up to the curb."<BR><P align=justify>
In each of the sentences above, at least one form of the verb "to be," is used to describe action.  Look at this revision and I think that you will see the difference.  <BR><P align=justify>
"He fought back his exhaustion and dashed through the door, outside and into the rain.  Water from the puddles soaked into his shoes and pants' legs as he raced for the corner.  He frantically hailed a cab, hoping someone would take pity on him and stop despite the inclement weather.  He felt his heart beating heavily and fast in his chest as he spotted a yellow taxicab flashing its lights and pulling up to the curb.  He let out a huge, relieved sigh as he climbed in and shut the door behind him."

<BR><P align=justify>Weak descriptors slow the pace.  Words like <FONT color="#FF0000">seem, seemed, seems, and seemingly</FONT> should all be used very sparingly.  Typically, these are redundant descriptors which take the emphasis away from the scene by softening it into a form of vagueness that the reader may not be able to readily identify with.<BR><P align=justify>
"It seemed like it might rain.  It seemed like every time Joanne wanted to jog in the park, it rained.  The days she had no desire to go outdoors seemed full of sunshine."<BR><P align=justify>
The above "seems" incredibly weak, not because of the redundant use of the weak descriptor but rather because it is present at all.  Consider the following revision:<BR><P align=justify>
"It looked like it might rain.  Practically every time Joanne wanted to jog in the park, it rained.  The days she had no desire to go outdoors were nearly always full of sunshine."<BR><P align=justify>
In the revision, we have a much stronger image that communicates very nearly the same thing.

<BR><P align=justify>Once you make these revisions, you can safely label your manuscript as a first draft and begin working on style, description of scene, characterization, and pace.  Good writing.
