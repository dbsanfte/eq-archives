<P>	
	In New England, you don't need a calendar to know it's the first
week of October.  The trees tell the story quite well as their
leaves change from shades of green to the bright vibrant 
shades of orange, red and yellow. At the peak of the fall foliage
season, it's truly a magnificent sight that draws people from all 
around to behold the beauty. The season progresses and the 
leaves fall to the ground one by one where they become 
nourishment for the grass, flowers and gardens in the spring.</P>

<P>As I spent Sunday collecting some of the fallen leaves with my 7 
year old daughter, I wondered what would happen if a tree 
stubbornly held onto to its leaves - refusing to let them fall to 
ground and nourish the new season that awaits only a few 
months from now. How would that tree be affected? How 
would the rest of life be affected?</P>

<P>The tree would become burdened by the accumulation of dead 
leaves it collected each year. Its branches would begin to sag 
under the weight of those useless dead leaves. Future growth of 
the tree would be impossible as it ran out of room for new leaves 
to bloom in the spring. It would soon lose its beauty as the lifeless
brown leaves cluttered its many branches. Eventually the tree 
wouldn't look like a tree at all but only a pitiful brown clump waiting
to die and fall to the ground from which it once sprang with such
vitality and zest for life.</P>

<P>And what about the grass, flowers and gardens that use the fallen
leaves as nourishment and further growth in the spring? Certainly
there are other sources of sustenance but none as natural and
readily available as is provided by the fallen leaves. Instead, they
would have to rely heavily on human intervention for their growth 
and survival - the tree no longer offering its own natural gift of 
nourishment. The entire circle of life would be burdened by the 
refusal of the tree give up that which no longer serves it.</P>

<P>Sometimes we are like that tree. We refuse to give up beliefs 
and memories that no longer serve us. We hang onto them, 
preventing our further growth and the growth of others. We
become burdened by the accumulation of useless dead 
thoughts that should have fallen away long ago to be used as 
intellectual and spiritual nourishment. If we're not careful, we 
can become - like the tree - a miserable creature who's lost 
our vitality and zest for life, eventually living in quiet 
desperation, refusing to be a natural source of nourishment
for the rest of the circle of life.</P>

<P>Spend a few minutes each day this week to think about what
beliefs you're holding onto that may be burdening you -
thoughts that should have fallen away long ago to nourish 
yourself and others. Some of them may be very old, dating 
back to childhood. For me, one of those useless beliefs came
from the memory of an assault by the town bully when I was 5 
years old. Once I finally let go of that belief, it became a 
source of further growth for myself and others.</P>

<P>Try this exercise. Watch a movie of your life. The movie starts
with your earliest memory and progresses chronologically 
through your life up until now. What memories stand out as
painful and what beliefs did you create from those memories? 
Maybe you remember your own bully or perhaps  a time when 
a parent or guardian was particularly angry toward you. 
Maybe you tried to accomplish something and failed in your 
attempt. Perhaps you still carry the guilt of a wrong you 
committed against another. Whatever you come up with, 
write your thoughts in a journal. Write everything that happened
in the experience and the useless belief you developed from it. 
Then ask yourself how you can use the  experience to nourish 
yourself and others. What can you learn that empowers you and 
others to experience further growth and learning?</P>

<P>Shed those old limiting beliefs just like the trees shed their 
leaves in the fall and make ready for the new season of growth
that awaits. Send me an email and tell me what belief you're 
going to let fall away this week. I'd love to hear from you. Have a
great week!</P>

<P>Its your life. Create it the way you desire!</P>
