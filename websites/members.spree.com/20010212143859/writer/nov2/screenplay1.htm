 <BR>Page 2  <BR><FONT size="+1">
<BR><P align=justify>
<FONT color="#FF8000">LONG SHOT	</FONT>- Indicates that the camera should be placed a significant distance away from the subjects of the scene.  Perhaps the subjects are strolling around a lake and the camera is mounted on the opposite shore.
<BR><P align=justify><FONT color="#FF8000">MEDIUM SHOT</FONT>	- The happy medium between a CLOSE and LONG SHOT.  In most cases, this is an unnecessary treatment as most scenes are shot as MEDIUM SHOTS anyway.  It is generally annotated to bring a camera out of either a CLOSE SHOT or a LONG SHOT as needed.  "We return to a MEDIUM SHOT of the lovers when the telephone rings OS."
<BR><P align=justify><FONT color="#FF8000">ZOOM</FONT>		- Indicates that the camera should move from a very LONG SHOT to a MEDIUM or CLOSE SHOT in the same take, thus "zooming," in on the subject.  This treatment was used very well at the end of the movie FAR AND AWAY when Tom Cruise's soul returns to his body from heaven.
<BR><P align=justify><FONT color="#FF8000">PAN</FONT>	- Indicates the camera should move in a steadily horizontal line across the scene.  "PAN down the line of new graduating pilots."
<BR><P align=justify><FONT color="#FF8000">SWISH-PAN</FONT>	- Similar to PAN but faster, with more dizzying effects on the viewer.  Frequently used to denote very rapid movement.  NOTE:  Avoid SWISH-PAN when writing for Television venue. <BR><P align=justify>
<FONT color="#FF8000">STOCK FOOTAGE</FONT>	-Tells the director that the scene can be realized using material already on film and in the camera from previous episodes.  Many exterior shots and car driving sequences, (such as the lead pulling the car into the family driveway)  are stored on STOCK FOOTAGE.  This saves time and expense in reshooting the location over again.
<BR><CENTER><HR></CENTER><BR><BR><P align=justify>
<FONT color="#B75B00">Other Terms:
<BR><P align=justify>Ellipsis  (...)	</FONT>- A mark or marks used in printing to indicate an omission or suppression of letters or words.  In scripts, most often used in dialogue to indicate thoughts or feelings unspoken but otherwise expressed by the character.

<BR><P align=justify><FONT color="#B75B00">END OF ACT	</FONT>- End of Act/Scene statements appear, not unexpectedly, at the end of an act and/or scene on a line by itself.  The notation conventionally reads "END OF ACT ..."  followed by the appropriate act number (spelled out or in roman numerals).

<BR><P align=justify><FONT color="#B75B00">ND	</FONT>-  The ND stands for nondescript (or sometimes No Dialogue) and the phrase is used to refer to a background character with no distinguishing characteristics (or no spoken lines).

<BR><P align=justify><FONT color="#B75B00">SUPER, SUPER OVER</FONT> - Short for superimpose.  Reference in scripts to text or graphics which are displayed over the screen image.
<BR><P align=justify><FONT color="#B75B00">
V.O. and O.S.</FONT>  -  Standing respectively for VOICE OVER and OFF STAGE (or OFF SCREEN), these two abbreviations are traditionally appended to the end of the Character's Name (over dialogue) to indicate that only the character's voice is being heard -- the character does not appear in the scene (V.O.) or shot (O.S.).

<BR><P align=justify><FONT color="#B75B00">P.O.V.	</FONT>	-  Point of View, used to denote from whose perspective a particular scene is shot.  For a study in this, watch the film PULP FICTION which shifts P.O.V. Rapidly between each scene.

<BR><P align=justify>There are literally dozens more terms.  Certain venues require slightly different script writing style than other venues.  For example, a 30 minute television screen play (called in the present industry jargon, a teleplay) is very different than an hour teleplay.  Episodic teleplays are different than original series' (Such as THE OUTER LIMITS) where the cast changes from week to week.  All of them have slightly different rules than say a two hour feature film script or a stage production stageplay.
Hopefully, this article will assist you in your endeavors and take some of the mystery out of screenplays.
