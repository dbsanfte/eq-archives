	<P>Aside from free programs, ebooks are gaining popularity

among online marketers, web masters and ezine publishers

as effective marketing or promotional tools.

They are used as come-ons or "baits" by publishers to

increase their ezine subscribership. Web masters offer

free ebooks to drive traffic to their sites. And online

marketers make use of ebooks to provide free and useful

information. At the same time, they include their products

and/or business information as part of the free ebook

download.</P>
<P>
The Irish group, Cranberries, came out with an album

a couple of years ago: "Everybody's Doing It So Why Can't

We?" This is exactly what every online marketer, web

master and ezine publisher should ask when they're

thinking of utilizing the marketing power of ebooks.

Yes, everyone does seem to be in the middle of the ebook

craze, offering free ebooks left and right. But, the question

should be followed by, "How can I be better at doing it?"

Yes, you CAN create ebooks and offer them for free as

promotional tools, but how do you put together an ebook

that's better than the rest? Ultimately, it won't be a question

of who did the ebook thing first, but who made the better

ebook. It won't be a re-invention of the wheel; it's how an

existing marketing and promotional tool was enhanced

two-fold or three-fold to get the maximum response

from potential customers.</P>

<P>So what makes a better ebook? What can you do to

offer a better ebook and make that ebook work for

you?</P>
<P>
THE KNOWLEDGE FACTOR. You wouldn't be publishing

an ezine or writing about something if you weren't an

expert on something, right? You wouldn't have put up

your own web site if you didn't have something important

to share. Or you wouldn't have started your own business

if you weren't equipped or experienced in the field.

This is where you'll get your ebook idea: your knowledge

or area of expertise. What do you know that you can

share with potential customers? If you can write four

or five short but meaty articles based on your area of

expertise and compile them into an ebook, you're well

on your way to creating a good reputation for you, your

business, your web site, your ezine or your products.
</P>
<P>THE GOLD FROM THE DIRT. Your prospective customers

will be able to tell if you're offering them a valuable

and information-laden ebook or if you're giving them

nothing but advertisements of your business or products.

This is the mistake most people offering free ebooks do

when they promote their business, ezine or web site.

Yes, you're offering a free ebook, and while people are

most responsive to the word "FREE," this shouldn't give

you license to bombard the free ebook with blatant sales

talk and promotion. More than anything, using ebooks this

way will only turn off prospective customers. I doubt if

they'll download another one of your free ebooks in the

future after finding out that the first free ebook you

offered them is 75% blatant advertising and self-promotion

and only 25% information.
</P>
<P>So before you go gung-ho and load every page of your

ebook with banners, referral links and red-lettered

sales talk, think twice. Offer them valuable and usable

content first, and be cautious with your use of banners,

logos and any other blatant self-promotion. I guarantee

you, they'll remember you better this way.</P>

<P>GETTING THE GOOD WORDS IN. Nothing beats the

power of other people's recommendation, approval and

reviews to promote your ebook and business. Even if your

ebook is free, you can solicit reviews on it by people: those

who already have a name for themselves or are experts in

the field you are in or a satisfied customer.</P>

<P>Use their recommendations when promoting your free

ebook. You can also include testimonials in lieu of

advertisements in the pages of your ebook. This is by

far better than peppering your ebook with your own sales

talk or banners. If you want to establish your expertise

and a good reputation for your business or service, then

let satisfied customers who've used your business before

do the talking for you.</P>

<P>Now that you know exactly how you can create the better

ebook, get into gear and start writing that ebook!</P>
