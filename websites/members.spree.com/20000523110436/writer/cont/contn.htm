Cicely Nevitt is an associate at a political marketing and research company, an undergraduate student at
the University of Louisville, and a poet. She enjoys the vast possibilities of poetry and its manifold outlets
of communication. The Louisville Poets' Guild, of which she is a wayward member, is an eclectic group of
wordsmiths who converge to immerse themselves in the essence of poetry. She savored her first
experience with being published in the Louisville Poets' Guild Anthology '99. She believes that when we
are writing about those things which move us, we are writing our own truths. There is joy in that
recognition.

<FONT color="#DF4800"><P><FONT size="+1"><U>RHONDA L. NOLAN </U></FONT> <FONT size="-1"> <P> 
is a part-time freelance writer living in southern Louisiana. 
 Her personal website is <A href="http://www.angelfire.com/la/rhondavous">RHONDAVOUS:  Romance by Rhonda</A> 

<P>She works full-time as a Community Outreach Specialist doing public relations 
and education, writing, editing, publications, graphic design, web site 
development, public speaking and fundraising. 
<P>
In addition to a B.A. in Journalism and an M.A. in Speech Communication from 
Louisiana State University, Rhonda is a former college instructor and 
semi-professional actor.  She attended the Professional Actor's M.F.A. 
Training Program at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. 
<P>
"Although I consider myself primarily a romance writer, my stories are often 
non-traditional in nature. I think there is more to the genre than a 
"formula." I have also written romantic comedy, romantic fantasy, futuristic 
romance, poetry and general fiction. I do not particularly care for the 
stereotypical supermarket paperback romance. My biggest ambition is to get 
published and eventually write my first novel." 
<P>
She loves red wine, pink roses, shades of burgundy, magnolias, hardwood 
floors, Pre-Raphaelite artwork, Europe, and her orange tabby named "Kee." 
<P>
"If you aren't passionate about something in your life, then you aren't 
really alive. I am passionate about being passionate!" 
<P>
Rhonda designed her fiance's web site,<A href=" http://www.angelfire.com/hi/GefilteShop"> Gefilte's Shop of Poetry and Prose</A>, 
 a collection of original, 
contemporary poetry by D. Alexander Levy.  She is also the designer, owner 
and editor of a new romance e-zine, <A href=" http://www.angelfire.com/la/Potpourri">Potpourri Romance Online</A> Rhonda is seeking unpublished short 
fiction and poetry for this zine!  Submission guidelines can be found at the 
site.
<P>
Her short stories have been published many times on the Internet.  Rhonda won 
a Golden Quill at The Short Story Workshop  (where she a co-founder and staff 
member there) for "The Truth About Caleb" and "Shades of Burgundy."  "Shades 
of Burgundy" also won Short Story of the Month in December, 1998 at St. Rose 
Press.  Other publications include: <I> The Fiction Network,  The Inditer, 
The Short Story Collective, The Reading Garden,  SOON Online Magazine,  Short 
Story Writer's Showcase,  The Writer's Quill, The Short Story Page, The 
Miserere Review, and the ever-popular, Writer's Choice Literary Journal.
</I><P>
In addition,  her poetry and short stories have been published in print 
magazines such as Emotions and The Threshold.  Rhonda's tribute to her late 
grandmother, "Butterfly Eyes" is part of <A href="http://dlsijpress.com/shards">Shards </A>
 an anthology of womens literature by DLSIJ 
Press.  All proceeds from this e-book go to the Breast Cancer Fund.
