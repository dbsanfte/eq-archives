Leslie Blanchard
<br>
<font size=3>I tell you the story below not to play on any sympathy.<br>
I tell you the story simply because there is a health care emergency in
 this country
and not enough people  know.<br>   There is also a great misunderstanding among 
the general public, and
even among the medical community regarding this disease. 
 I report this story
firsthand -- I was diagnosed with MS last year.It is my hope that these 
links and this story will
help
promote change and understanding.<BR><BR>

<br><BR>


 This time 2 years ago, (March 27th, 1997), I was diagnosed with
Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis.<br>
I'd been feeling bad, with really strange symptoms for over 18 months 
  I'd gone from doctor to doctor and most of them felt my
symptoms were due to stress.  My condition was worsening, my list of symptoms
was growing stranger by the day and no diagnosis was in sight.  While I knew
what was happening to me was real, I didn't report every symptom to my doctor
-- I was afraid I would be taken for crazy.



<br><br>

In June of 1996, I resigned my position at 
Southwest Texas State University because I was feeling so awful, I could
no longer maintain a sixty hour work week.

 I wanted to  devote all my 
energies
 on my literary agency and editing service -
  some of you may remember Bearlife Women's Writing Advocate.
 The business was growing beyond belief.  I offered free
evaluations which meant that between 40 and 60 manuscripts were submitted each
week.  Meanwhile I bought into the stress diagnosis, I hired more people, I
worked harder, and my overall condition suffered.

 <br><br>
Then in Feburary 1997, the entire right side of my body went totally numb.
 I was
virtually paralyzed. My GP said it was a pinched nerve, or some other easily
explainable and treatable ailment. <br>
I knew better, so   I asked for either a spinal tap or an MRI -- I wanted 
the doctor
to check for MS.  My internist replied that my arm was numb because I had
carpal tunnel syndrome and that my leg was numb because I was imagining it.
  I
had just been labled crazy.
<br><br>
After I raised enough hell, she got me in to see the top neurologist 
 in my area.  Without any tests, just by observing my 
condition, he
suspected immediately that I had MS.  He was correct, but what he wasn't
 able
to diagnose until after viewing the results from my MRI was a course of MS
that is the most severely debilitating -- primary progressive.  
 <br><br>
When the hospital called my health insurance company seeking authorization
 for
the MRI they were told my policy had been terminated. This was news to
 me since
they had just accepted and paid other claims. But, despite my best arguments,
 those of my lawyers, and even the hospital adminstration -
I was effectively without insurance. <br><br>
 The next few months were extremely difficult.
 I got
worse, despite massive IV's of steriods and a cornucopia of other 
medications.<br>
I could no longer work effectively and, sadly, I had to close
 Bearlife in May.<br><br>

I have come to a place now where I am able  to compensate for
 my growing disabilities. 
  In discovering how to compensate for my illness I have learned to 
schedule my
 days to ease the
symptoms and pain, and I have also learned to listen to what my body tells
 me.<br>
So, needing to work to prevent total atrophy of my brain from lack of use( there's little
to be done to prevent the atrophy of my muscles),  I opened A Writer's Choice eZine. 

<br>

<br><br>
Basically, I want to tell all readers to LISTEN TO YOUR  BODY !<br>
It has ways of letting you know what's up.<br>
 If a doctor tells you 
 you're nuts - then find another doctor !!<br> As I said, my GP refused to listen to me,
she even told me entirely incorrect "facts" about MS.<br>
Don't believe that your insurance will be there forever - make certain, read your policy, call and speak to
their representive if you have questions.<br>
Don't believe that if you grow really ill or disabled that our government
will stand by you and supply you with the disabilty benefits which you
 have already earned.<br>
Don't believe that if hard times strike you, and you lose your abilty to work,
lose your health coverage, and fall seriously ill<br> that most hospitals and doctors will
treat you- they won't. <br><br>
But most of all dear reader - <br> don't assume anything.<br>
The thing about MS is this- there is no way to understand it. <br>
Science does not understand it, those of us who have it certainly
don't understand it.
One person's MS is not the same as the next person's. 
<br><br> And please, please
never judge your fellow beings until you have walked in their moccasins.<br><br> <BR>
Below are some links which I hope will provide information, 
and education about Multiple Sclerosis. <br>
Special thanks to my great good friend Susan for her valuable input with this
report.<br><BR>

Editor's Note:<br>
I truthfully feel that I owe my life to the internet.<br>
When I was diagnosed I could find no up-to-date or reliable
information about Multiple Sclerosis in the print world.<br>
The internet provided a wealth of the latest, most current
information available, and a beautiful newsgroup which provided comfort
 and understanding. I feel certain that I could not have
emotionally survived this past year without these wonderful resources.

 Do you have a medical horror story? An atrocity perpetuated upon you by an HMO, an insurance provider, a doctor, the Social Security system,
the general public who lacks understanding of disablity?
