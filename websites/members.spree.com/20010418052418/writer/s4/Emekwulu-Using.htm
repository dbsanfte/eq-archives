	<P><I>Intuition, through dreams or other psychic experiences is at the core of many breakthroughs in history.  Shouldn’t we learn to trust it more?  Here is an advice from an author who was inspired to write a book by a dream experience.</I></P>
	<P>
  In wartime England, as the Prime Minister heads for an important meeting something tells him not to get into the waiting car.  Moments later, the vehicle exploded.</P>
	<P>In the late nineteenth century, a teenage Physics student in Zurich, West Germany imagines himself to be riding along a light beam.  This marked the birth of the Theory of Relativity.</P>
	<P>When Archimedes ran out of his bathtub naked shouting, "Eureka, Eureka", he was not crazy, he was not possessed by the evil spirit.  It was as a result of intuition.  It was as a result of inspiration.  Archimedes
today is remembered for his famous Archimedes principle in Physics.</P>
	<P>In 1960, a Chicago businessman ignored the advice of financial experts.  Instead he trusted his hunches and purchased a small chain of hamburger stands.</P>
	<P>Mozart  claimed that he received his inspiration from within.  Socrates said he was guided by his inner voice and so did Einstein, Edison, Marconi, Henry Ford, Luther, Madame Cure, and other Nobel Laureates.</P>
	<br><hr><br>
	<P><I><STRONG><U>The Neglected Power</U></STRONG></I></P>
	<P>Einstein's Theory of Relativity, Churchill's hesitation  to enter the waiting car, Archimedes' experience in his bath tub and Ray Kroc's McDonald's are all examples of the power of intuition.
Intuitive experience has been described with many terms:  inspiration, sixth sense, hunches, insight to name a few.  Many of the greatest world philosophers, artists, writers, musicians, and scientists such as Einstein, Mozart, and Beethoven have owed their accomplishments to intuition.</P>
	<P>Articles on this subject have been carried in such publications as Entrepreneur Magazine, Fortune, Forbes and the Wall Street Journal..  Yet, since  intuition is beyond scientific explanation, it is both the most powerful and the most neglected of human mental faculties.  All along, intuition has been part of the instruction of most mystical schools or organizations.  </P>
	<P>Their  emphasis is on the development of the higher self.  Unfortunately, people are busy looking for empirical evidence of intuition.  The end result of this search is disappointment.  </P>
	<P>Yes, disappointment, unless the search is a genuine one and not out of skepticism  According to Perspective on the ABC New TV Program, such genuine researches are now currently in progress at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and at the University of Nevada in the United States. </P>
	<P>Intuitive ability is a potential, but some of us make a conscious effort to either block, repress or deny its existence and consequent manifestation.</P>
	<P><I><U><STRONG>Intuitive Dreaming
</STRONG></U></I></P>
<P>Dr. Fredrerick Banting, the Canadian physician, discovered while in a dream the basis of insulin. </P>	
	<P>Elias Howe, the inventor of the sewing machine, worked for years for its design, yet one thing always remained  for him to achieve his goal.  </P>
	<P>One thing!  one night he dreamt he had been captured by savages who were pointing spears at him, and he noticed that at the tip of each spear was a hole.  Howe woke from his dream with the solution:  put the hole at the tip of the needle.  That key unlocked the invention of the sewing machine.</P>
	<P>Noble prize-winner, Dr. James Watson had been working trying to decipher the molecular structure of DNA, for donkey years, but all to no avail.  One night while in a dream, he saw two snakes coiling around each other.  Instantly, the woke up exclaiming, "I wonder if that’s it?  I wonder if DNA is a double helix twining around itself"?  This led him to understand the genetic coding for which he was awarded a Noble Prize.</P>
	<hr><P><I><U><STRONG>A special dream experience</STRONG></U></I></P>
	<P>Intuition is real, not a fantasy.  I believe in intuition. Why?  Because it exists, and proofs of its existence abound. I even wrote one of my books, <I>FIbonacci Numbers For Research Mathematicians & AI Applications</I>, inspired by a dream experience.</P>
	<P>Before I continue, let me offer some explanations.  A set of numbers like 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 (geometric series), increases uniformly in twos.  Therefore, it exhibits a pattern.  A set of numbers like the one above is also called a sequence or series.  A sequence can take other forms other than the example given above.  Having offered this explanation, let’s go back to my dream experience.</P>
	<P>On the night of March 30, 1993, I had a dream where I say a partial floral representation of the Fibonacci sequence.  For those of us not familiar with Fibonacci sequence, it runs like this:  1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, x, y, x+y...</P>
	<P>This sequence was discovered by an Italian mathematician named Leonardo Pisano, and each of the numbers in it is called a Fibonacci number.  One outstanding property of this sequence is that the next term in it is a sum of the two preceding terms, e.g. 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3 =5, 3+5 = .8</P>
	<P>The following morning I took up a piece of paper and a pen.  Initially, I thought it would have been an article of about 20 pages.  I was wrong.  As days passed by, the more I played with those numbers, the more I discovered properties of the sequence.  The properties are as exciting as they are interesting.  So I ended up with about 15 0 pages of material out of sheer inspiration.</P>
	<P>Numbers of the Fibonacci sequence have many properties.  Fibonacci numbers appear in nature.  They have applications in arts, architecture, artificial intelligence, and other fields.</P>
	<P>Anyway, discussing these and other properties is not the objective of this article.  What was exciting to me in this dream experience was the transformation of consciousness.  During and after the dream experience, I was extremely calm, peaceful, and serene.</P>
	<P>I am short of words to describe my actual experience, but have not in my forty-something years of existence on this planet, attained that level of consciousness.  It was amazing!</P>
	<hr>
	<P><I><U><STRONG>Learning to Listen 
</STRONG></U></I></P>
<P>One of our weaknesses as human beings is our continued tendency to believe that reality can only be perceived through the five mundane senses of sight, smell, touch, taste and hearing.  To some people, it is a matter of seeing it before they believe it. </P>	
	<P>
	They want to smell it.<BR>
They want to touch it.<BR>
They want to taste it.<BR>
They want to hear it.<BR>
	
	</P>
	<P>This kind of thinking makes me uncomfortable.  These people believe that any knowledge not gained through a conventional classroom should not only be questioned but rejected outrightly.  This kind of thinking is not only dangerous, it is inimical to human progress and development.</P>
	<P>We can experience intuition anywhere - at home, in our workplace, on the street, while driving or shopping.
</P>
	<P>Powerful thoughts and ideas that have contributed to human progress and civilization (both past and present), have always come to their owners not necessarily while in conscious state but in altered state of consciousness.  These include dreams, out of body experiences.</P>
	<P>Such thoughts and ideas in more or less logical forms, need be captured and written down, otherwise, they could disappear..  Even if they are not entirely lost, they might lose their original flavor.</P>
	<P>Therefore, in order to maintain the present level of civilization, and still further human progress, we have to maintain open minds to these experiences.  We have to keep our minds open to these kind of experiences. 
We all have an inner voice.  We just have to improve our listening skills.</P>
