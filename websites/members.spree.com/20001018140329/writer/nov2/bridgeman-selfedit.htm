Self-Editing<BR>

<BR><P align=justify>
Every writer faces challenges with regards to editing his work.  Some things, such as style, description of scene, characterization, and pace are a bit vague, difficult to nail down with a set of hard-and-fast rules.  Other things are more easily resolved.
<BR><P align=justify>As professional writers, we have an obligation to ourselves and our craft.  We cannot, in good conscience, produce a series of sentences with sloppy spelling, usage, grammar, and punctuation, while loading our manuscripts with redundant usage, weak descriptors, and fragments with the expectation that "the editor," will fix it.  The fact is that some of us are guilty of exactly that when we are writing to beat a deadline.  The other fact is that if this becomes our habit, we will quickly find ourselves wanting work.
<BR><P align=justify>A professional writer works hard.  We all know that writing is hard work or everyone would do it.  A professional writer works to widen the gap between his work and that of every other writer.  His writing is clean, tight, observes the rules of grammar and punctuation, and almost never needs heavy editing.
Some hard-and-fast rules for self-editing are explained in this article.  Assume you have just completed the first draft of your manuscript.  In your own mind you should label this your, "rough draft," because there is almost no possibility the piece will go to press exactly as you have written it.  If you have the luxury of time, set the rough draft aside for a day or more and work on something else.  This will greatly enhance the possibility that you can be more objective when you look it over for the purpose of revision.
<BR><P align=justify>Things to check once it is in front of you:
<BR><P align=justify>The first rule is always spell check the work.  With today's inexpensive and readily available word processors that come with very powerful spelling checkers built in, there is really no excuse for a blatant misspelling.  Remember that your manuscript is competing with several other writers' work that has been spell checked for accuracy.
<BR><P align=justify>Another problem with spelling is that several writers make words up.  Some examples are: toneness, colorness, Petofile, things like that.  None of these are actually words in the English language.  If a word does not show up in your dictionary, use one that does.
<BR><P align=justify>Writers often put words like "rest room," and "good bye," together to form one word.  They are not.  They are two separate words, although another accepted spelling for "good bye" is to hyphenate it so that it reads, "good-bye."
<BR><P align=justify>The use of numbers spelled out and numerals of the Arabic variety are often confusing.  Essentially, there are a few very simple rules that apply to this area.  Always use numerals when referring to any measurement such as distance.  Time is more flexible and I will show you the difference.  "The vehicle traveled at 60 mph for 10 minutes traveling a distance of 10 miles, 6 feet, and 1 inch; or roughly 1.609 kilometers, 2 meters, and 8 centimeters.  He finished the lap at 4:07 p.m. exactly."  
<BR><P align=justify>Meanwhile, when referring to just about everything else, spell the numbers out.  "The driver was twenty-five years old and won fifty-thousand dollars for breaking the one-hundred-fifty year-old record."  Notice that the numbers are hyphenated.  This is correct according to both the AP Style Book and Libel Manual as well as the Chicago Press Manual of Style.

<BR><P align=justify>As mentioned before, time is more flexible.  If you are writing for precision, you can use numerals and the abbreviations for ante meridiem (a.m, meaning the hours between midnight and noon) or post meridiem (p.m., meaning the hours between noon and midnight), as in the above example.  If you are not writing for exact precision, you can spell everything out.  "Cheryl arrived at the bakery shortly after three that afternoon."
<BR><P align=justify>Now that you have completed your initial spell check, start at the top and check the spelling of each and every word again.  This time, be especially conscious of typographical errors.  These insidious little beasts hide throughout a piece and are difficult to spot.  Because we have grown so dependent on spell checking programs built into our word-processors, we assume that every word is spelled correctly.  In fact, they may be, but due to a typographical error, the word in the sentence is not the correct word for the manuscript.
<BR><P align=justify>Lightning is often replaced with lightening, when the former is a bolt of electricity witnessed in a thunderstorm, and the latter is what a candle does in a dark room, for example.  Won and own are both accurate spellings of completely different words.  "I can't wait to have children of my won.  He own the race in record time."
<BR><P align=justify>Lank instead of blank and rang instead of range; "They turned as a single unit and fired at point lank rang."
<BR><P align=justify>Seed instead of seen; "I've seed a lot of strange things in my time."
<BR><P align=justify>The following nearly appeared in the Technical Manual for the US Army's Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge:  "Ensure that the bride is mounted properly and secured with chains before attempting to utilize."  Obviously, the word should be "bridge."
<BR><P align=justify>The trouble with typographical errors of this type is that we often insert the proper spelling mentally when we reread the work, making the typo invisible.  This is why it is an especially good idea to set the rough draft aside for a few days if possible before reading for revision.
