~ A DAYLIGHT DREAMING ~


Take me away to the sweet land of Fae
Where dreams will all come true
Goodness, and beauty reign night and day
Magick, no evil stew!

Enchanted forest, sing your song for me
Melody of romance
May true love come, a heart who will be
My own eternal dance

Oh shelter me my kin, my Faery friend
Give your love your kisses
To my lone heart, for tenderness to mend-
I will be your Mrs.
</pre>
<BR><CENTER><HR></CENTER>
<BR><U>Part 1 - Late Summer</U>
<Pre>
The seasons of life ebb and flow
Some lift you up,
While others bend you low
Treasure each one,
We need them all to grow.
</pre>
<P align=justify>
It was a rare summer indeed, for the Fae families of the enchanted forest. 
The harvest was abundant, cellars full and over flowing. Wheat was stored for 
grinding in the months ahead. Timber - a plenty for warmth, and building - 
was split, smoothed and stacked away. Vegetables, and fruits, both canned and 
fresh stored in the cellars. 
<P align=justify>Valenia's grandma Zola, and mother Delina, had the gift of healing. Herbal 
medicine was also stored if needed for illness and birthing. They attended 
all Fae births in their village, blessing mothers and all wee younglings. 
Legends tell of Fae birth rites, a magical joy, an innate goodness passed 
from generation to generation.
<P align=justify>Hardy laughter echoed through the trees. Good cheer abounded with much hustle 
and bustle as they prepared for the coming winter festival. This was to be 
the largest, most celebrated in the realm.
<P align=justify>Valenia, their own fair maid was now promised to Prince Nyklus. They would 
celebrate their wedding rites during the height of the gathering. The Fae 
people held a winter solstice festival each year. King Augus, and Queen Nera 
joined them every fifth year. This year was an exception with their son's 
wedding, they would come two years in a row. A festival castle was built over 
the summer for their visits. The people were proud of the workmanship built 
with both stone and wood. They also built a huge portico near the entrance 
for all the celebrations.
<P align=justify>This was where the wedding rites would be held, at the edge of the meadow 
with the castle up on a knoll. Incense cedar, spruce, and many other 
varieties of pine surround this meadow and glen. Year round, severe weather 
skirts the Fae forest making ideal conditions. They enjoy the changing four 
seasons in all their beauty with ideal temperatures. Winter was especially 
exquisite in beauty, with crystal frost forming a light coating on everything 
until the glen sparkled like diamonds. Snow fell, yet never more than an inch 
or two. The entire village resembled a wonderland. Certain varieties of 
flowers thrived, Pansies, Chrysanthemums, and the sacred miniature white 
orchids. With a light sprinkling of magic, and shelter from trees, to break 
the wind blooms were huge!
<P align=justify>Earlier in the summer, when Valenia and Nyklus were out walking they heard 
the sound of hoof beats. A herd of unicorns came running toward them. Even at 
a distance Val could tell that Leap, [short for Leopold] her beloved 
childhood friend was in the lead. They stopped short of them near a grove of 
conifers to graze on grass. Val's heart was pounding as she told Nyklus she 
had not seen him since he left last spring. Just then he left the others 
coming toward her. Following behind him were his mate, a small female and 
their little foal. The baby reminded her of Leap when he was young. Leopold 
put his nose in her hand, she gave him a few pine nuts, [her favorite snack] 
he knew she kept them in her pocket. He nudged her in fondness and 
recognition. Valenia was so happy to see him and his family. The herd stayed 
near the meadow for a few days where she visited often with Nyklus watching 
in fascination. Valenia was content to know he was happy with the herd and 
his own family.
<P align=justify>This time of growing love between Val and Nyklus was precious. Two lives 
growing into one toward their joining. They had spent time in both the glen, 
and at the main castle to learn more of their new lives together, so much to 
learn. There was time to listen to each other, and for their friends. Then, 
there were times of silence, when quietness was the beauty of their language. 
No words were needed, love filled the spaces. Feeling went beyond what words 
could express.
<P align=justify>Dak, Valenia's brother, and wife Cynan had adopted a puppy from friends. 
Animals ran free and enjoyed life with the Fae. Trina, another friend had 
given Valenia and Nyklus a kitten. This growing kitten traveled back and 
forth with them as they were both fond of her. She was calico, and they named 
her Bits, most often calling her 'little Bits.' They had another pet, Nyklus 
gave Val a horse as an engagement gift. She'd never ridden and enjoyed having 
Nyk teach her to ride. No less did he enjoy teaching her, she was a natural. 
He chose a young sturdy mare from the castle stable. She was both gentle and 
beautiful with a gold coat, and white mane and tail. Her name was 'Neea'ba' 
which means swift beauty in the ancient Fae tongue.

<BR><U>Part 2 - Love's Full Joy</U>
<BR><pre>
It takes two for soaring heaven
with wings touching, rejoicing.
Sublime eternal love,
their souls reaching, joining.
</pre>
<P align=justify>
Weather cooled once again in the glen as fall came, and went, bringing color 
to the trees and foliage. As winter neared the level of excitement grew into 
joyous celebrating. A party for the engaged couple was planned. Everyone 
brought hand made gifts made with love. This was a traditional joining party 
complete with favored dancing, food, and drinks.
<P align=justify>While all the busy preparation went on, other dramas were unfolding. Trina 
who watched Jen from afar for as long as she could remember tried her best to 
keep her secret. Jen was popular, and nine years older. She imagined he never 
noticed her in the back ground. Trina was painfully shy and almost never let 
her feelings show. She pictured herself, as drab, heavy, and not very 
attractive. She did admit that her eyes were large and round! Her father once 
told her she had eyes like a young deer. Trina's mother said they were her 
best feature.
<P align=justify>In fact Jen noticed her, oh yes. He went out of his way to find reason to 
catch a glimpse of her. This was not easy as she was an only child of an 
older couple. They lived at the edge of the village.
<P align=justify>Once he saw their cottage roof was in need of repair. He offered to help 
Trina's father fix it. But that was earlier in the year, several months back. 
Jen purposely worked slow to have an excuse to be near. Her father invited 
him to stay for an evening meal, for he was genuinely fond of him. Trina 
hardly spoke, and kept to the kitchen, it was natural for her to help her 
mother. She liked cooking, and keeping the home. When ever she thought no one 
noticed, she'd look at Jen through heavy lashes. Clearly she adored him, and 
had for a long time.
<P align=justify>He found her shy ways appealing, and thought her form lovely in every way. 
The fact that Trina saw herself as heavy, caused Jen's eyes to follow her 
every move. Full womanly curves kept him busy finding excuses to help out. He 
dug the garden up for their small winter crop which was near the cottage. 
Trina helped by weeding, she reached across to grab a weed and accidentally 
touched his hand. Good gravy he thought, she blushed bright as beets! Feeling 
bold Jen took her hand and squeezed it gently. He smiled into those big eyes 
of hers, she forgot to breath. He bent down and just brushed his lips across 
hers. Without thinking, speaking in a whisper Jen said, "I love you Trina." 
In silence, she raised on her toes, she kissed him with a passion which 
surprised them both!
<P align=justify>Love seemed to bloom in mid air, as though it were catching. Even Bouck, 
Valenia's youngest brother was eyeing 'every' young girl in the glen!
Cynan, Val's sister by rites, and best friend was with child now. She was so 
happy, and wore her clothes loose for comfort. Dak strutted about like a 
Peacock on parade. He was clearly about to bust his shirt buttons with pride. 
Their wee one would arrive soon. Cynan was sorely disappointed, due to her 
advanced condition. she couldn't be Val's 'Matron of the Joining.' One 
evening Dak consoled her with an idea. "Why not suggest to Val that she ask 
Trina?" She thought that was a great idea! "Oh Dak of course, it's the 
perfect answer." With that she hugged him to her. Well, as close as they 
could!
<P align=justify>There was no way she would be able to travel alone to the falls for the 
sacred white orchids. She could however help Trina weave them and feel part 
of the rites. This morning Valenia was coming over to visit. Cynan could hear 
her humming to herself before she saw her. On meeting, they affectionately 
kissed each other on the cheek in greeting. "Hello how are you feeling?" Val 
asked. "I feel like a big fat cow," she answered. They both laughed, and went 
inside to relax for a while. Val spoke first, "We both wanted you to be 
'Matron of the Joining' but you aren't able. I've been thinking with your 
approval, I'd ask Trina to be 'Maiden of the Joining' what do you think?" "I 
think she said giggling, I was about to suggest the same thing!" "Well, this 
isn't the first time we've had the same idea" Val said. Then they were both 
laughing!<P align=justify>
So it was settled, and when Val asked Trina if she would, she had tears in 
her eyes, saying "I'd be most honored." Valenia was sure to explain exactly 
how, and where to find the falls and over which bridge to go. They both knew 
that Jen would be following and watching over her. Most certainly after the 
accident that happened to Valenia when she went to cut the sacred orchids for 
Cynan and Dak's joining. <P align=justify>
Jen had a tendency to move slow when it came to decisions. However, after he 
heard of Trina's intended walk to the falls as 'Maiden' he made a swift 
decision. The white orchids were brought back with out delay or problem.
<BR><pre>
~ LOVER ~
Come to me in winter's cold
Bending close to me
Press your body next to mine-
Warming, searing the soul
Sway with me,
Till our heat explodes
Love me with passion,
Soar on my wings-
Fly till we're dizzy
And wonderfully numb-
Let us dive from the heights
Till spring's bright birth
Satisfy passion a moment in time-
May we soar on and on
Never to land
Fly on into summer,
It's sun and it's sand-
Let us not touch
The bonds of earth
Instead may we float
Away on this day‚Ä¶free,
Free as birds my mate-
Again and again goodbye space,
Till eternity bites
With autumn and frost
Till heaven closes it's gates,
And hell loses all fury
Let us love on and on without end-
For Valenia & Nyklus
</pre>

Part 3 - The Royal Joining
<BR>
<pre>
In winter's glory love was set,
amid the crystal frost-
Sacred flowers, eternal love,
Entwined their hearts embossed.
</pre>
<P align=justify>
All things in their time come to pass. They don't however always go according 
to perfect plans. Not even in the enchanted Faery villages. 
Never before were the heavens more lovely than on this day of the 'Royal 
Wedding Rites.' There had been rain, followed by a sprinkling of snow. The 
sun triumphant burst through as final preparations were finished. Color 
streaked the sky with lavender, pink, and yellow clouds. Across this crystal 
palace of wonder two rainbows in full spectrum of color arched over the 
meadow.
<P align=justify>For well over a week there had been celebrations of all types in this winter 
festival. It was now time for the Kings trumpets to sound. There was an honor 
guard of soldiers representing his Royal Highness. Other regiments remained 
behind to guard the main palace. The Royal couple would arrive there tomorrow 
morning to spend there special days alone together in wedded bliss. The 
palace maids had been cleaning, and fussing over their rooms for days. They 
would have satin sheets embroidered with their initials. Fresh rose petals 
would be sprinkled over their bed linens shortly before they entered their 
rooms. Huge bowls of fresh fruit were being readied, and all variety of 
beverages and food.
<P align=justify>Everything was in readiness, King Augus and Queen Nera were seated in 
splendor on the portico. Valenia's family were invited to join them, those 
member's not taking part in the rites. Delina, Zola, Dak, and Bouck sat next 
to them. Beautiful floral ropes were draped all around the meadow and along a 
satin walkway.
<P align=justify>Fanfare of trumpets blared through the air. The King shouts, "Let the wedding 
begin!" All the village girls under six years in matching pink velvet go 
first tossing rose petals. They are followed by Jen 'taking Valenia's 
father's place, dressed in blue velvet as were the men in both families. 
Valenia wore an exquisite white velvet gown. Following them are Cynan and 
Trina with the circle of love between them also dressed in pink velvet. 
As Valenia nears Nyklus, their eyes meet in their own thoughts. He reaches 
for her hand, and the crowd roars and cheers loudly in approval. Together 
they walk alone toward an altar of trimmed juniper loaded with cut flowers. 
On their right and left are lit candles, rows and rows of them all glowing in 
the crystal light of noon. They turn to look into each other's eyes, still 
holding hands in Fae custom. Then Trina comes forward to wrap them in the 
traditional circle of sacred orchids tying them together. Jen smiled to see 
her so lovely fulfilling her role as 'Maiden of the Joining.' Valenia speaks 
first in her soft lilting voice. "To you Nyklus I give my heart to hold 
forever more. I promise to adore, and love you with my whole being. You honor 
me, and I honor you for as long as the stars shine will my love be. I pray 
that I may bring to you many children all blessed with the light of creation. 
I hope they will be beautiful as you are my Nyklus." 
<P align=justify>Then it is Nyklus turn to speak to Valenia. "My dearest love Valenia, thank 
you for being my mate and for the most precious gift of all, your love. I 
accept the sacred trust of your heart and will treasure it gently and 
tenderly till the sun and moon cease to be. Indeed it is you who honor me 
with your life. You have agreed to share this gift with me. I hope never to 
cause you a moments care. May our children, and their children some day out 
number the grains of sand near the great sea. Light grant us growing old 
together in love, as on this day." This ended their vows!
Within the traditional moment of silence as the couple kissed, a scream comes 
from Cynan's throat. Dak ran from the portico in swift steps. He took her in 
his arms as she said, "I am sorry my child comes!" The King rose and said, 
"hold your cheers please." Silence remained until Cynan was safe in their 
home along with grandmother Zola to help with the birthing. 
<P align=justify>Joining hands Queen Nera and King Augus raise them high saying, "Our children 
are of one flesh now. Here after they will be known through out the land as 
Their Royal Highness' Prince Nyklus, and Princess Valenia!" Cheers rose once 
again. After the noise diminished, He said, "May the feasting begin." What a 
day it is, with fun had by all. Nyklus and Valenia were allowed to come and 
go, to be alone to share this over whelming love and excitement. 
In their small home, Cynan looked up at Dak, and Zola with tears and pain of 
birth saying, "I'm so sorry, I ruined the joining." "Little mother to be Zola 
said, you did nothing of the sort." Listen, the celebrations continue. Dak 
brought all the prepared clean bedding and supplies they'd set aside for this 
moment. Zola said, "here Cynan take this hold it under your tongue to ease 
your pain my daughter." When the next pain comes push with it to help your 
wee one. In three more pushes there was a new little boy!
"Good girl" soothed Zola as she wiped Cynan clean with soap, and warm water, 
drying her. Dak held his baby boy and cleaned him off as Delina came through 
the door. "Oh how beautiful he is she cooed at the proud new parents. A knock 
on the door sounded. Dak said, "Yes" and Valenia begged to come in. It was 
Cynan who weakly said, "Come." Val took one look before her tear filled eyes 
over flowed down her cheeks in happiness. I'm an aunt! What will you name him 
she asked? Well, Dak said, "we decided on Taylif after our father if given a 
boy." Perfect they all said in unison! 
<P align=justify>And so it was on the day of the Royal Wedding they had a new member join the 
family of Fae. Many traditional ceremonies would be ahead soon as Cynan felt 
stronger. Nyklus and Val left the festivities to be alone for the night. 
After their morning meal, with their families they left for the palace. Jen 
made an announcement with Trina blushing at his side. He cleared his throat 
loudly, and said "come summer there will be another joining." Trina says 
she'll be my mate! Congratulations were shared with all.

<U>Part 4 - Sinister Evil and Hope</U>
<BR>
<pre>
A demon's hunting foray,
Till evil eyes see prey -
Misfortune lead astray,
May mercy light their way.
</pre>
<P align=justify>
With the winter festival pronounced closed for another year, life began to 
return to normal. Of course that didn't include Valenia, and Nyklus still at 
the castle, nor Cynan and Dak. They were still walking on clouds. Wee Taylif 
was the most perfect youngling ever born‚Ä¶they both agreed on that.
It was about this time that some very strange things began to occur. For one 
thing there were claw scratching sounds, rustling, stirring in the underbrush 
and leaves at night. The dogs whimpered, and other pets cowered in their beds 
instead of barking or defending their domain. Sounds which even grandmother 
Zola and Delina could not discern from any they'd ever heard before. The Fae 
kept their doors, and windows closed tight not just from the cold, [for 
winter still seasoned the air] but fear was the feeling most often felt! This 
unknown drove the men crazy. Zola cast a spell of safety, but this evil was 
stronger than her spell. Sounds continued, blood curdling screams heard only 
in the night.
<P align=justify>Jen worried about Trina, and her parents living out so far. He asked them to 
move into their home till they could end what ever manner of evil this was. 
They agreed, mainly for Trina's sake not fearing much for themselves. That 
night they heard an animal cry out, then silence. Dak would not leave Cynan, 
and Taylif unprotected so he didn't accompany the others. Jen, Bouck, and 
several other men armed with sheathed swords of magic went out to scout the 
glen that night. Holding lanterns they found nothing but bloody remains. 
Whatever this was, or they were, the victims were torn to shreds.
A meeting was held, patrols set up and word sent to the palace for help by 
carrier pigeon. The return message said a group of men were on their way 
accompanied by the ancient Fae wizard Braegon to help solve this danger. No 
one knew how old he was, but all knew his magic was strong.
<P align=justify>The village council ruled no one was allowed to go anywhere alone. The women 
ad children were always guarded by men. Wood cutting ceased for now, all 
stayed near the village.
<P align=justify>That very night the patrol came back with tales of huge lizard like creatures 
with dark gray skin, and long saber like teeth. They were seen flying in over 
the meadow, their wings bat like webbed in between. This fanned everyone's 
fear all the more. Apparently they were nocturnal, but the Fae were careful 
at all times. Jen knew if all was well the men should arrive from the palace 
in the morning.
<P align=justify>And glory to be for sure, about an hour after day break horses were heard, 
they were almost there. Jen and the others hoped they could capture one of 
these monsters so they'd know what sort of evil this was. The lantern light 
they held up seemed to reflect off shiny scales. 
<P align=justify>The men and Braegon were set up to stay at the castle on the knoll. When the 
men were called in by him, he asked them to sit down and listen. "I have 
brought strong magic, we will stop this evil." After they explained all they 
knew Braegon spoke again. "This evil is caused by the others, the people who 
fly in metal machines, and send their younglings off to war. They have 
sprayed poison on the forest and it has drifted over onto us. This poison 
cause's a mutation of genes changing normal creatures into vicious killing 
machines. I know too from what species they come, they were ordinary harmless 
lizards. However with genetic mutation of their genes they grow into these 
flying dragons who crave blood and flesh to eat. Tonight I will take you Jen, 
and Zola with me, do not be afraid. This evil will end soon. Jen asked Zola 
to carry the lantern, he wore his sword, with Braegon leading the way. He 
said, "Do as I ask." At midnight they moved to the center of the meadow. He 
asked Zola to hold the lantern high as possible, from the pouch around his 
neck he removed the potion he'd mixed. Braegon said, "Listen, they come, be 
ready." Draw your sword Jen, when I say now raise it up high in a circle. 
Silence, moments stretched into long minutes.
<P align=justify>"NOW" he said. As Jen's sword circled light zinged from it like stars bright 
as day. Braegon threw the potion up and it spread wide in the light. He 
yelled in the old Fae tongue "GLY-GETHID" meaning 'death to evil'! The light 
and potion spread till it was seen all over the glen above the tree tops. The 
next day the children asked where the monsters were, they wanted to see one. 
Braegon laughed and said, "I'm sorry younglings but they are gone now and 
will never be seen again. We hope the 'others' will not spray poison again 
over some other creature and change it into something evil.<P align=justify>
Later in their home, they could scarcely believe it was over. Zola said, 
"This will be a story for you to tell your children, and grandchildren about 
Jen." In fact I'd guess it will be a story all will tell in future legends.
The weeks passed and winter came to a close with the opening of buds on the 
Fae fruit trees. The orchards looked like huge floral gardens in pink and 
white all delicate and pretty. Soon the ceremony for little Taylif would 
begin. Now that danger was past, the royal couple would come. Nyklus would 
not take a chance with her though he wanted to come with Braegon and the 
others.<P align=justify>
Old Chadman the record keeper was talking to Zola only this morning about the 
delay of birth rites. He was none to happy about it either, though he knew 
they must wait till danger passed. He kept records of all births in the 'Book 
of Faery Life.'<P align=justify>
The day was warm on this ceremonial day of spring. Valenia and Nyklus arrived 
yesterday, and were settled into the castle. Delina and the other ladies had 
worked preparing all types of food for afterward. The village all followed 
little Taylif's family and quite a procession it was. Cynan carried him in 
her arms, as they walked to the Mist river. He was four months old now, they 
formed the circle around Taylif, Cynan, Dak, and Zola. Cynan removed his 
clothes as Zola held out the special aromatic herbs. She rubbed them over his 
cute little body, he laughed up onto her face. Zola thought to herself, how 
blessed I am this is my first great grandchild. My little Taylif who looks so 
like his father. Holding him high she said these words: <BR><pre>
"Those whose eyes see love
Are blessed beyond compare-
Fulfillment for your life,
Your heart we prepare."</pre><P align=justify>
With that Taylif was dipped in the water three times and then before he 
shivered Zola gave him to Cynan who wrapped him in his drying cloth. Old 
Chadman smiled as he wrote Taylif into the 'Faery Book of Life.' A cheer rose 
into the air from the village voices. They sang songs of old as they all 
walked back up the hill to enjoy the feast. Aunt Valenia held Taylif close 
walking next to Uncle Nyklus who was smiling with thoughts of his own 
children to come.<P align=justify>
Joy Peace and Prosperity reigned for years and years and years. Oh, did I 
tell you? The Faery spirit never ever ever dies!

<BR>
<pre>
~ TAYLIF'S  SONG ~
My sweet precious youngling
Conceived in love
Born in winters' solstice
Our own little son
You're the heart of our home
Small body already strong
Blessed of Faery land
Destine for greatness
A triumph your life
Already so handsome,
With your father's chin-
I see my own eyes
When looking at you
Best of all, you are gentle
A great manly trait-
Fair lover of goodness,
Your birth rite as Fae.
</pre>

	                      What good did it do?
                          to give vitamins, to cook good food for him,
                          for this precious child I love.
                          Long ago he left home,
                          with his pot and his beer in tow.
                          God only knows what else he ingested
                          but this I know for sure:
                          He is forty now, still using, and drinking.
                          He has teens of his own, now doing drugs-

                          One steals a gun, and other things-
                          they're in and out of Y.D.C. jail.
                          Run, running away, to the streets they go
                          taking their beepers of rage, why this anger?
                          I can taste their bitterness, the acid of their hate‚Ä¶

                          Do you know what a young girl will do?
                          when addicted to crack cocaine-
                          Anything, anything at all
                          just to get the next fix.
                          She thinks her John will take care of her,
                          because she's na√ive and sick.

                          Her beauty of body is firm, a face soft and sweet
                          as an angels - she turns another trick!
                          No prom for her, nor diploma,
                          she's after crack cocaine, wants to experience life!
                          Jail and probation is nothing with the danger
                          of aids or a knife in the back.

                          Her brother goes to court soon for theft,
                          God only knows where he'll go
                          or what his anger will compel him to do.
                          His actions speak drugs and more pain-
                          conning is easy, his parents and counselor want to believe!
                          These are the babies I held, ever so tender with love
                          thinking of college and happiness, now there is only pain,
                          it cuts like a razor sharp stone-blood tears shed.
