	<P>Moms of infants lose 400 to 750 hours of  sleep
                                              each year, according to a report
                                              published in Parents magazine. 
</P>
                                              <P>No matter how old our children,
                        we moms often see the wee hours as the most flexible time of
                        day. During the day, we know we’ll be busy nursing the baby
                        or driving the kids to soccer practice. That leaves late night
                        and early morning to catch up on all those things we didn’t
                        have time for the day before.</P>
                         
                        <P>But sleep is important to our entire well-being. A good’s night
                        sleep restores and rejuvenates us—mind, body, and soul.
</P>
                      <P>  Everyone has different sleep requirements. Most of us need 7
                        to 8 hours of sleep to function at an optimum level. A simple
                        test: if you feel drowsy during the day, you probably aren’t
                        getting enough sleep. </P>

                    <P>    Sleep deprivation can lead to a loss of strength, a compromised
                        immune system, and high blood pressure, as well as a decrease
                        in concentration, memory, and learning ability. Perhaps most
                        noticeably, sleep loss can result in a downright rotten mood,
                        and the inability to cope with those small pressures and
                        stresses you confront each day. </P> 

                      <P>  Tips for more restful sleep...</P>

               <P>         During the day<BR>

                             A regular exercise routine will help you fall asleep
                             faster and wake up more refreshed, but experts do not
                             recommend vigorous exercise fewer than three hours
                             before bedtime. </P>
                        <P>     Instead, schedule your workout five to six hours before
                             lights out. Why? Exercise causes your core body
                             temperature to rise. Experts say natural sleepiness will
                             set in when your body temperature drops again.   
                             Find another place for stressful activities. Pay your bills
                             at the kitchen table, not in your bedroom.  
                             Avoid nicotine and alcohol before bed. Nicotine is a
                             potent stimulant, and the metabolism of alcohol has an
                             alerting effect. </P>
                         <P>    Skip the afternoon latte, as well, since the stimulating
                             effect of caffeine can remain for as long as 12 hours.
                             Keep in mind that many teas and sodas, such as
                             Mountain Dew and orange soda, contain high caffeine
                             levels, as well.</P>  
                           <P>  Restrict your water intake just before bed and during
                             the night. Midnight trips to the bathroom can cut into
                             your sleep, particularly if you have a hard time dozing
                             off again.</P> 
                           <P>  Six hours of continuous sleep often result in a more
                             rested feeling than eight hours of on-again, off-again
                             snoozing, since non-consecutive sleep interrupts its
                             deep, restorative phases. </P> 
                         <P>    Check to see if any of your prescription or
                             over-the-counter medications might be interfering with
                             your sleep. Some birth control pills, diet pills, blood
                             pressure pills, and anti-depressants can have a rousing
                             effect.</P> 
                    <P>         Sleeping pills, while they may be tempting, are not the
                             answer. They lose their effectiveness quickly and can
                             be addictive. </P> 

                    <P>    At night<BR>

                             Create a nest. Eliminate clutter, maintain a comfortable
                             sleeping temperature, and keep the room dark.
                             Nightlights and bright moonlight can interfere with
                             quality sleep. Install window treatments that block light,
                             such as wooden Venetian blinds or shades with blackout
                             lining. </P> 
                        <P>     Practice aromatherapy. (for more information, see
                             Momscape's “Making Scents of Aromatherapy." 
                             Lavender oil or a lavender sachet on your bedside table
                             can help you feel relaxed and sleepy. 
                             Keep your bedtime routine consistent. Many people
                             treat themselves to a high-carbohydrate snack 30 to 45
                             minutes before bed. Then engage only in relaxing
                             activities. </P>
                      <P>       No bedside table should be without Sarah Ban
                             Breathnach’s Simple Abundance,  which features a
                             new affirming and empowering essay for every day of
                             the year. Simple Abundance is an enriching element of
                             any bedtime routine.</P>  
                         <P>    If you can’t leave your worries at the bedroom door,
                             make a ritual of asking yourself a question just before
                             bed. Give your subconscious a problem to solve during
                             the hours you spend sleeping. You’ll be surprised how
                             often you’ll wake up with the solution after a good
                             night’s sleep. </P> 

                      <P>  Still can't fall asleep?<BR>

                             Just do it. Orgasms increase endorphins, which can help
                             you feel into a deep sleep.<BR> 
                             If your mate is causing you to lose sleep, get help.
                             Consult a doctor about a chronic snoring problem.
                             Invest in a good mattress so you won’t move each time
                             he does. <BR>
                             If you haven’t fallen asleep within 30 minutes, there is a
                             problem. Lying in bed and staring at the ceiling will only
                             increase your anxiety. Get out of bed. Do something
                             relaxing, such as deep breathing or meditative exercises.
                             Then try again later.  </P>
