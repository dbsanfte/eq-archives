 <P>If it ain’t coming, it didn’t go, one of the seven laws of the
universe.  Well, it’s one of the seven laws of the universe,
*paraphrased.* </P>

<P>Un-paraphrased, it’s the Law of Cause and Effect.  Loosely
put, it means what goes around, comes around, or . . . If it
ain’t coming *back to you,* you didn’t send it. </P> 

<P>You need to send something out before it can come back.  So I
guess the question is . . . What have you sent out lately? </P>

<P>Hard work?  Good thoughts?  Or not hard work?  Not so good
thoughts? </P>

<P>If you send BAD out, guess what?  You get BAD back, and you
sometimes get it back so fast you aren’t able to move aside to
avoid it.  Wham-o, that’s just how fast.  </P>

<P>In other words, if you kick someone who’s down, YOU’D BETTER
HIDE! </P> 

<P>***   Unfortunately, hiding never works.  Why?  
Because this Law of Cause and Effect is a YOU-seeking missile!
*** </P>

<P>If you send GOOD out, guess what?  You get GOOD back.  But
there’s a twist.  I have found, for some reason, that GOOD
takes a little longer to come back.  Which is OK.  I like to
savor.  Of course, I’m not above reminding the universe every
once in a while that *I’ve been good.*</P> 

<P>What are you sending out? </P>

<P>To get a little technical, the Law of Cause and Effect is one
of the most important parts of a person’s life.  Socially,
spiritually, emotionally, physically, AND financially.  And
here’s why.  Everything that happens to you, happens for a
reason.  Knowing this, here’s what you must do.  You must
concentrate on the CAUSE, and the EFFECT will automatically
take care of itself.</P>  

<P>Let’s take this one *cause* at a time. </P>

<P>Socially, do you sit home alone, or do you gladly accept
company and all that comes with it?  What are you sending out?</P> 
<P>
Spiritually, are you praying, then taking everything back,
because you just know God isn’t going to grant you what you
want?  Or are you hesitant to accept anything and everything
the universe has in store for you?  What are you sending out? </P>

<P>Emotionally, are you not feeling loved, therefore, you’re not
sending out love?  Where do you expect love to come from?  I
mean, really, if we can’t love ourselves, how can we possibly
expect others to?  </P>

<P>Here’s what you must do.  Every morning, just after you wake
up, spend fifteen minutes saying things that make you feel
good.  I personally like “I am loved, I love, I am loving.  I
love myself and all creation.”  But you know what.  It took a
while to get there.  </P>

<P>It was real hard to say any of the above, when I was feeling
totally unloved.  But you know what?  I worked at it until it
felt so good, I couldn’t imagine not being able to say it.  Of
course, I had to rephrase it just a tad until it felt right to
me.  I started out with, “I’m beginning to feel loved.”  And
then I imagined what *beginning to feel love* felt like.  Man,
did that feel GOOD!  What are you sending out? </P>

<P>Physically, what are you sending out?  “I feel terrible.”  “I
feel so down.”  “I feel like a freak.”  OK, OK, OK.  We won’t
even go into that last one right now.  But here’s what you can
do to change that.  Change the tense from present to past.  “I
felt so terrible.”  “I felt so down.”  “I felt like a freak.” 
See, that’s how you FELT.  Now, you can move on.  </P>

<P>You might have felt so terrible, but it’s time to move on. 
You might have felt so down, but, again, it’s time to move on.
 You might have felt like a freak, but that’s not who you are.
 IT’S TIME TO MOVE ON.  What are you sending out?  STOP IT. 
Just plain stop it, so it can’t come back.  *That’s your
mission, should you choose to accept it.* </P>
<P>
Financially, what is the metaphor you are *sending out* for
your life?  “I’m broke.”  “I’ll never have a new car.”  “I
can’t get a decent job.”  What are you sending out?  Your
thoughts are affecting you physically, so now you’ve got to go
through everything above AGAIN.  What are you sending out?</P> 

<P>OK, now, let’s take control of our lives.  Rather than be
affected negatively by this very powerful Law of Cause and
Effect, we should use it positively by always remembering what
goes around, comes around.  There is no vindictiveness, it’s a
fact, what goes around, comes around.  YOU can stop it NOW. 
YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE. </P>
