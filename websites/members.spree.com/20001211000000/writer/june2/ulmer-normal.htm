	<b>

	<P>It's 3:00AM and instead of sleeping, I'm trying to 
figure out how to get listed near the top of the search 
engines.  Am I normal?</P>

<P>Am I normal?  I pondered that question this morning 
while I quickly checked email one last time before 
shuffling the kids in the car and off to school.</P>

<P>Am I normal?  It crossed my mind again while racing back 
toward my home office as I watched a group of moms 
head to the bagel shop for coffee and a chat.</P>

<P>Am I normal?  This afternoon, as my neighbors talked 
intensely about the latest episode of ER, my mind kept 
wandering back to my web site, and I wondered if that 
was normal.</P>

<P>My mother tells me I should quit thinking about business
so much and just enjoy my children, which I do, but I 
still wonder, am I normal?</P>

<P>Am I normal?  My friends look at me as if they've seen 
an alien when I tell them that I'm never going back to 
my corporate marketing career.  I'm building an Internet
empire from my home, would they like one too?</P>
<P>
Now, don't get me wrong.  I love life and live it to the
fullest, with lots of playtime.  But, ambition and the 
challenge of  "building the perfect beast" push me 
relentlessly sometimes.  I figure you can relate if you 
are reading this article.  You are looking to create 
something bigger than yourself, too!</P>

<P>But, it's a crazy world we live in.  A world where 
people have learned to stifle their dreams, their 
desires, their creativity.  We are taught to "settle" 
for what we are dealt in life.  All too often, when we 
try to move beyond that, those closest to us try to 
hold us back, save us from ourselves.</P>
<P>
"Consider yourself lucky for what you have."</P>

<P>"It's a good job and the benefits are great."</P>

<P>"The average American family has thousands of dollars 
in credit card debt."</P>

<P>"It's too risky."</P>

<P>I don't know how you feel, but I want to LIVE my dreams,
have my heart's desires and allow my creativity to 
blossom.  I want to be my own boss, work in my pj's if 
I choose, take a four hour lunch to go shopping and 
fire myself when I'm not measuring up.  (Of course, I'm 
eligible for rehire tomorrow!)</P>

<P>Normal SHOULD be waking up when your body is rested, 
not when the alarm clock rings.  Normal SHOULD be 
taking a vacation when it fits your family's schedule, 
not when your seniority allows.  It SHOULD be having a 
parent at home when a child comes home from school.</P>   

<P>To me, normal ISN'T sitting in rush hour traffic twice 
a day.  It ISN'T working fifty weeks in exchange for 
two weeks off a year, or five days on for two days off 
a week.  It ISN'T wearing my name and picture attached 
to my clothing. </P>

<P>Everyone must determine their own definition of what 
"normal" is and isn't.  For those of us who have 
decided to step outside the box, take control of our 
lives and build our own business, normal is anything 
BUT normal!</P>

<P>Life is full of risks, it's true.  But, everything 
great that has EVER happened has done so with some 
degree of risk.  I don't want to get to the end and 
WISH I had taken just a few risks.</P>

<P>I'm urging you to take some risks with me!  Step up to 
the plate!  Decide what it is you want out of your life 
and your business and GO FOR IT!  FORGET ABOUT NORMAL!  
Create your own "normal!"</P>

<P>We are at the very beginning of the new millennium!  
The Internet is overflowing with possibilities, as it 
breaks all growth records ever set by anything, and it 
is just not NORMAL!</P>

<P>As I lay in bed, building my empire (business) on my 
laptop, I realize just how much I love my 
other-than-normal life.  I wouldn't trade it for 
anything!  The clock says 10:07 PM.  Ahhh, lunch break!</P>
