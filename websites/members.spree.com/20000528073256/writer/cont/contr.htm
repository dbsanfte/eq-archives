successful quickly, so much so that my work now appears internationally
in fifteen hard copy magazines and over seventy zines.  I like to write 
about anything which captures my attention using it as a means to explore
my response to whatever the stimulus might be.  My writing tends to be 
visual.  Snobbish as it may sound, I can't bear overtly cerebal poetry
which makes no attempt to engage the senses, but philosophises on
the condition of mankind - blah!  I would like to revitalize interest 
in poetry among ordianry Australians - wish me luck.</FONT>

  I am 32 years old and have been writing for
almost two years.  My wife, Katie, and I are the proud guardians of our
15 year-old niece, Jessica. I began writing to help organize my thoughts
in a more linear fashion, and just haven't been able to stop.  It looks
as though I may be in it for the long haul...

I have been  experimenting with
different genres and narrative styles.  I have recently been
elected to the Board of Review at the <A href="http://www.angelfire.com/on/shortstoryworkshop

I have also started a new series of articles aimed toward the novice writer.
It is called "A Guide for the Fledgling Writer".  Articles will soon be
posted on my homepage and any other place that wants them.<P>

  Writing is a hobby only.  My
intuition tells me that I should keep my day job...

<img src="jr.jpeg" align="left">There's a primitive tribe that carves huge birds from milky white wood and leaves
      them hanging in the jungle to surprise and delight whoever stumbles along. They do
      this to keep their souls from getting bored and drifting away. They call their artistic
      endeavors "toys for the soul". My writings are my "toys" and the InterNet is my
      jungle. Should I fail to surprise and delight any unwary surfers, I'll settle for
      becoming rich and famous.
