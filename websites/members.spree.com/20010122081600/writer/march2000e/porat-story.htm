<U><B>I</B></U><P align=justify>
That summer, a few days after I was demobbed, I had a very strange 
experience.  One afternoon I had a sudden urge to take an old school exercise book 
and a large yellow pencil out of one of the boxes in which I kept my few belongings.  
I didnt yet have a permanent room in the kibbutz, and I was constantly moved 
from one old hut to another.  Once I was condemned to a room that was narrow 
and dirty, and once I found myself in a room where the floor tiles were sparkling but 
the walls were cracked and there were no windows.  Another time I awoke in a 
strange room filled with a stinking pile of mattresses among the decaying huts of the 
Nachal unit.
<P align=justify>
        I used to get up for work in the sheepfold while it was still night.  The sand 
paths 
were still damp, and the snail tracks clearly marked.  I would spend the day working 
hard in the humid heat, burrowing away in the manure and absorbing deep into my 
skin the sharp smell of sheep which never wore off.  In the afternoon I would wake 
up from a steaming sleep, soaked in sweat, lying between the sheets and thinking of 
my young life.  Between one duty and the next and between one awakening and 
the next, there is always a time when the soul flutters here and there, searching for 
its future.  But I was so eager to know what my life held in store and at the same 
time so caught up in the pressing details of the present that I never even managed 
to plan one step ahead.  Everything that happened took me by surprise and 
nothing was done out of choice, and yet everything was so expected and so 
natural that I couldnt even imagine that beyond the steaming horizon there might 
be a different life, close enough to touch. 
<P align=justify>
        After stretching out this sweet interlude as long as I could, slowly waking up 
out of 
a fantasy dream full of memories of my recent army service and full of strange 
visions of the future, I got up and left the hut.  Beyond the hut encampment, just 
behind the walls, there was an abandoned plantation of subtropical fruit trees, 
guavas that had ceased to bear fruit, worm-ridden pomegranates and a few loquat 
trees whose leaves had withered.  I spent many hours in that forsaken garden when 
I felt weak and drained, examining the veins of the leaves and the peeling trunks, 
looking at the clusters of white snails packed together in the upper branches.  In the 
silence that reigned after the overpowering bleating of the sheep, I imagined hearing 
voices calling me and directing me to my new path.  My whole body was taut.  I 
strained my ears to their utmost.  I climbed up to the tops of the trees to shorten 
the distance to those uppermost regions.  But I heard nothing, and I had to come 
down and beat a path through the dry thorns out of the plantation  and search for 
what I so much needed somewhere else.
<P align=justify>
        There was nobody waiting for me in the whole, wide world.  I had done my duty. 
 I 
had completed my stint and felt free to wander half the night.  On the other side of 
the hill the kibbutz hummed with life.  Mothers called their children with 
long-drawn-out cries whose echoes could be heard all over the green fields.  Those 
days I had already begun to ask myself those same questions which trouble me 
today.  Does my young life have any meaning?  Why do I drift aimlessly from hut 
to hut?  Who is it that directs my life in such a way that I wake up to the stinking 
breath of sheep?  Is this a test that I have to go through?  And what comes after, 
after I have passed through each of its difficult stages?
<P align=justify>
        This habit of asking myself questions about my life while I wander along the 
paths 
and by the hedges hasnt left me until today.  And eventually, as usual, I find myself 
in the small, leaf-covered plot of the cemetery.  I have already written elsewhere 
that our cemetery is outside reality.  It is outside space, for its surroundings are 
neither dwellings nor garage, but a beaten down piece of ground that preserves the 
place as it used to be years ago.  I have also written elsewhere that our cemetery is 
outside time, for what meaning can there be here to the passage of the hours?  
What does it matter if it is now late afternoon?  And what if the wind that rustles 
through the branches soon dies down and gives way to the waves of croaking that 
rise from the swamp, from the thousands of frogs that will soon come out to hunt 
mosquitoes? 
<P align=justify>
        I sat down on a mound of sand.  The cool sand penetrated my clothes and 
touched my skin.  If there is one memory that I cherish, it is the touch of sand on 
my bare skin.  When I move my leg about in the tunnels of the ant-eating insects, 
the grains of sand slide out of the holes and along my muscles, get caught up for a 
moment between the hairs and continue to slide as far as the delicate folds.  I was 
beginning to consider letting myself fall a prey to that kind of self-pity I enjoyed so 
much.  I would fix my eyes on the sun sinking into the not-so-distant sea and 
abandon myself wholly to daydreams, an almost unchanging series of yearnings, 
each one leading to another.  A parade of longings would arrange itself in my head 
and step out on its tireless march.   
<P align=justify>
        But all at once something slipped.  A figure stole into the shadows of the 
cemetery 
trees.  I heard footsteps and then the farm sounds of water rushing through pipes 
and the short tap-tap of the prongs of a rake on gravel.  And suddenly time stood 
still and it was as if my whole being burst out of the sand and out of the earth itself 
like some shining balloon.  I began to hover between the slowly darkening sky and 
the lengthening shadows on earth.  Everything came to a halt.  The yearnings 
disappeared and I had the strange feeling that I might be vouchsafed a rare glimpse 
into my future life.  Deep inside me I felt a thrill of excitement.  It was as if someone 
had promised me that a small window would now be thrown open, and through it 
my life would run as if on a screen.  In my ears there were voices which I imagined 
were telling me the longed-for story of my life.  It was as if someone 


were measuring out the years of my labour, distinguishing between one job and 
another, permitting and forbidding and offering advice.  All I had to do was give 
myself over to the sweet sounds and not even allow myself to think that I agreed to 
it all.  Nor in fact was I terribly surprised since I had long hoped for some such 
illumination.  When I was still 
walking along the thorny path between the withered guava trees, I guessed that I 
was approaching a joyous revelation such as this.  I was already on my feet, 
shaking the sand from my trousers, and hurrying barefoot towards my suffocating 
hut, to the old exercise book and the thick pencil.  I remember:
<P align=justify>
        On the unmade bed, in the cloud of sour stench, dripping sweat on to the 
exercise 
book and dampening its pages, I began to write with the stupid feeling that I had to 
record for posterity the wonderful vision I had just seen.  I was in such a hurry not 
to forget anything and not to mix up the details that the pencil tore the pages, but I 
took no notice.  I turned the pages without stopping, panting with passion as I 
wrote down everything about the strange incident that had happened to me, the 
figure that had stolen into the cemetery, the hands that had carried out the holy 
task, watering the plants and raking the leaves and cleaning up around the 
tombstone.  And there was a kind of insubstantiality about the whole incident, as if 
the figure had no name and as if I did not know her, and as if I didnt exactly know 
who she was or what she was doing here now at this disconnected moment.
<P align=justify>
        I threw myself into the writing until darkness filled the room and I had to stop.  
When I got up to put on the light, it seemed as if I had written all there was to write. 
 I felt how I was slowly being drained of the extreme tension that had held me.  
Afterwards I took the exercise book in my hands and wondered at how I could have 
written so fast and what actually was lying there between the pages.  I was sweating 
terribly and went outside to get some fresh air.  One of my friends was already 
getting ready to go to the dining-room for supper.  While I was writing I had been 
so detached from time that I did not realize how late 


it was getting.  Whistles and shouts began to echo between the rotting huts, while a 
wonderful feeling of liberation came over me, a great lightness of my whole body.  I 
threw the exercise book on to the bed and flung the pencil at the wall.  I joined my 
friends and hopping on one leg I went with them to the dining-room.

<P align=justify>
        In the same way I sent the story to the editor of the literary quarterly.  I found 
the 
quarterly, which was then a new publication, in the magazine reading room on the 
top storey of the Cultural Centre of the kibbutz.  After the exhausting night milkings, 
I used to go into the empty room, turn on the lights, sit by the window and lose 
myself completely in reading the magazine.  Fellows of my age, who had just been 
released from military service, used to publish poems and marvellous maiden stories. 
 Their way was already laid out before them.  Somebody pushed them and 
somebody else pulled them, and they wouldnt have to wait like me until they 
couldnt deny their writing.  They wouldnt spend ten years in silence, eating 
themselves up, maddeningly distancing themselves from what they really had to do. 
 I dont remember any more whether I copied out the story once or twice.  Be that 
as it may, it was that same old exercise book and clumsy engraving pencil that I 
used.  I gave the pages to our post office clerk and together we arranged the 
rebellious leaves in a brown envelope.
<P align=justify>
        Are you sure this is the correct address? she asked me.  Are you sure there is 
an 
address like this in Tel Aviv?                                                                                           
  <P align=justify>
        

        Yes, yes, I answered hastily.  I turned pale and began to sweat and my pulse 
raced.  The whole business was not very pleasant.  It didnt suit people whose 
destiny was to work until they dropped.  What a strange occupation, out of the 
ordinary!  And just you wait, I said to myself, wait until it gets around in the kibbutz.  
I quickly forgot the whole thing and 


put my writing out of my mind.  I immersed myself in hard work and in the details of 
the daily routine.  
<P align=justify>
        With whom could I share my distress?  My co-workers with the flock were 
occupied with the sheep, and on their free evenings they would roast lambs meat, 
drink beer and make pigs of themselves.  The other youngsters in the kibbutz were 
immersed in their jobs, their girl-friends and the modern machinery.  I, on the other 
hand, felt wonderful music 
around me and wonders that were about to take place, while the world looked new 
from moment to moment.  I sensed from afar that there was a different world which 
was destined for me as I was destined for it, but in the meantime I was a prisoner in 
the rat race.  As a matter of fact, I wasnt unhappy with the situation.  Somebody 
would have to appear from nowhere and drag me by my coattails until I realized 
that my time was getting short.  If it didnt happen soon, I would never be able to 
join the chorus whose fresh voices I heard as I excitedly leafed through the pages 
of the literary quarterly.  
<P align=justify>
        Only our experienced librarian seemed to suspect me of something.  Although 
he 
was always grumbling and complaining, he had a particular soft spot for me.  After I 
had overcome the hurdles he used to place in the way of the readers, I could feel a 
kind of unspoken invitation.  "Not everyone can be a reader, a genuine reader," as if 
he was trying to 
hint, "You have to exert yourself in order to ascend the ladder of reading."  He used 
to hum old tunes to himself while bent over his files and shoot annoying questions 
at the tormented readers.  "Why do you need to read, anyway?  Isnt the 
newspaper enough?  Anyway, who said that there was such an author whose 
books you insist on reading?  In any case, its much more interesting outside.  
Theyre building the kibbutz, fighting wars.  Why do you have to squeeze yourself 
into this miserable library where you cant even find a decent catalogue?"
<P align=justify>


        But I couldnt suddenly open up, blushing with sudden shyness, and tell him of 
my 
attempts at writing.  He would have asked me, "Why do you have to write 
yourself?  Have you read everything that others have written?  Who told you that 
what you have written hasnt already been written by better writers than you?  And 
anyway, theres more than just a little bit of audacity in what youre doing.  Who are 
you altogether?  Here are all the works of Y. H. Brenner, have you read them?  
Have you seen the stories of A. N. Gnossin?  Have you spared a glance at the 
volume of new poems by Avraham Shlonsky yet?"
<P align=justify>
        But I knew that there was no way I could reveal my deepest thoughts to him.  
For 
even if he knew more than others, and even though he loved books to distraction, 
he would not be able to understand my little melody.
<P align=justify>
        In this way three weeks went by.  Actually, I didnt even expect an answer.  The 
sudden fit of writing passed and I returned almost to routine.  What I had 
experienced at the time of writing had already quietened down, and if annoying 
afterthoughts arose, I silenced them.  I didnt go by the cemetery again, and I tried 
not to remember that unique picture of the small figure stealing in to look after the 
tombstone.  I also made an effort not to resurrect the moment of illumination that 
had impelled me a with a power that was completely new to me.  I had learned my 
lesson and taken the hint.  But I had no power to change the rest.  I didnt even 
dare to imagine that there might be groups of budding poets in the big city, and 
that I, if I only wanted, might be able to join them, and that everywhere, young 
men, beginning writers, were pressed against bookshelves.  The post office clerk 
met me in the burning hot dining-room at midday, between one milking and the 
next. 
<P align=justify>
        "Youve got an answer from Tel Aviv," she said, and since it was a big 
envelope, I 
was invited to the post office to collect it myself.  Puzzled, I followed her.  What was 
the meaning of the large envelope?  Anyway, who had expected an answer from 
the editor of the quarterly?  In fact, what did I have to do with all that remote and 
forgotten business?
<P align=justify>
        We went into the post office and she handed me the envelope.  After she 
closed 
the door behind her, she asked, "Have you told your father yet?"
<P align=justify>
        "What about?"  I asked her.  "What do I have to tell him about?"
<P align=justify>
        "About this envelope," the post office  clerk said.  "And about your first stories." 
 <P align=justify>
Without waiting for an answer, she turned and went off.  I looked for a hidden 
corner where I could be alone with the editors answer.  I ran down the hill to my 
little, isolated hut, closed the door firmly behind me and opened the envelope.
<P align=justify>
        Pages of my old exercise book fluttered out of it.  I recognized my hasty 
handwriting immediately and my wild pressure on the pencil.  Then, when I shook 
the envelope, a piece of office paper with the name of the quarterly printed on it fell 
out as well.  My young heart began to beat and I sat down on my pallet and began 
to read.
<P align=justify>
        It wasnt the editor himself who had answered but his assistant, the secretary 
of the 
editorial board.  "Since the editor is busy and cannot read all the material that arrives 
" and then, "It is obvious that this is your first story.  There is a great deal of your 
souls outpouring and many important sentences.  I am sorry to say, however, that 
this is not enough.  You have much to say but you do not yet have your own 
poetic language, etc. etc."  After that she continued, "Why dont we wait a bit, we, 
the editors, and you at your table, say another year or two, until you produce a 
more satisfactory piece of literature?  What do you think?"  And finally, "You should 
know that we have done you a personal favour by taking the trouble to read your 
jumbled handwriting  and in pencil, too!  Something we havent come across in our 
literary tower for years!  In future, if you want anybody to take the trouble to look 
at your manuscript, please be so good as to type it out on a typewriter as they all 
do!  Now we are sending you your manuscript back even though you didnt enclose 
a stamped, addressed 

envelope as required.  Yours faithfully, Signature, Secretary to the Editorial Board."  
Stunned, I began to search around me, in the boxes and the crates, for a box of 
matches.  I threw things aside and dropped all kinds of articles on the floor but I 
couldnt find any matches.  I grabbed the packet of papers and ran to the guava 
thicket.  There, above the main sewage pump of the kibbutz, I bent down over the 
wire grating and tore the pages into little pieces and furiously threw them, together 
with the letter from the assistant editor, into the powerful, swirling current of the 
sewage water.  I stayed there, bent over the grating, till the very last piece of paper 
disappeared, and then I sat down panting on the concrete wall, so upset that I didnt 
even notice the horrible stench.

        When I went to my parents room in the evening, my father was sitting at his 
large 
desk, as was his practice these last few years.  The desk was piled high with 
dictionaries and lexicons, and other books, which he was translating, lying open.  He 
was leafing through a Russian booklet and said,  "Sit down and make yourself a cup 
of tea.  Mom isnt back yet but Ill gladly join you."  
<P align=justify>
        While I was busy at the sink making the tea, Dad said from his desk, "So 
youve 
started to write, eh?  Why all the secrecy?  Why the mystery?  The post office clerk 
told me something.  What did you write, a poem or a story?"
<P align=justify>
        "Something not fully worked out," I said casually, not wanting to continue the 
conversation which had suddenly become too revealing.  Sometimes, when my 
father opened up because he was excited, he used to tell me about new words he 
had found in the course of his translation work.  He would marvel at an excellent 
story he had come across by chance in a foreign language journal.  He would praise 
a young author nobody had yet heard about.
<P align=justify>

        "Writing is a serious business," Dad said, "and it cant be done just like that, at 
the 
drop of a hat, between the night milking and taking the sheep out to pasture."
<P align=justify>
        The post office clerk really annoyed me.  Who asked her to report on every 
letter 
that went out?  Whats it got to do with her if this was my first attempt?  And 
anyway, who gave her permission to report to my father and scrutinize everything I 
did?  I poured out the tea, set the cups on saucers and didnt answer. 
<P align=justify>
        "Where shall I put your tea?" I asked, coming to the desk.  There was a think 
volume of Mishpat HaUrim lying there and I spilt a few drops of boiling tea on Isaiah 
Steinberg.  
<P align=justify>
        "Never mind," Dad said, "You have to know how to pour out tea, as well.  And 
for 
some reason or other I thought you, too, wanted to be a volleyball player."
<P align=justify>
        My brother played volleyball on the kibbutz team.  He was an outstanding 
player, 
and when Dad could get away from his desk, he took a lot of pride in his son.
<P align=justify>
        "If not a player then in charge of the sheep, or work rota organizer, or even 
farm 
manager.  Why not?  These are also important things for a lad of your age."
<P align=justify>
        We sat and drank tea.  Dad put down the Russian booklet, took off his glasses 
and 
gave me a strange look, as if we had were meeting again after a long absence.
<P align=justify>
        "Have you brought the manuscript with you?  Give it to me and well have a 
look."
<P align=justify>
        "No," I said.  "It was a ridiculous effort and its not worth talking about.  Anyway, 
I 
got rid of it myself."
<P align=justify>

        "You threw it away?" Dad cried out in amazement.  "Didnt you leave yourself a 
single copy?"
<P align=justify>
        "No," I said.  "I dont need a copy."
<P align=justify>
        "But maybe I need a copy," Dad burst out.  "Dont get into bad habits.  Its about 
time you began to cultivate correct working habits."
<P align=justify>
        I looked at the Midrashim that were always to be found on Dads desk and the 
books of commentaries with papers stuck in between the pages and his dog-eared 
black Bible.  Even though I had made one small, abortive effort, that doesnt make 
me a writer, and even though I had caught a glimpse of distant places, the night 
milking still waited.  And even though the time would come for me to choose 
between different worlds, that time was still a long way off, hidden away in the folds 
of the long years that were still to come.  Why should I bother with it now?  The 
time that waited for me in the pastures, or chained to the little milking stool or in the 
dust of the feed that rose from the milking stalls seemed long, infinite, immeasurable.
<P align=justify>
        Dad tried to approach me in a different, gentle way.  He might succeed by 
placating me instead of rubbing me up the wrong way by being too straightforward.
<P align=justify>
        "Why dont you try to write out the story again?  You must surely remember 
most 
of it.  Words are not so easily forgotten.  Do it for me.  I only want to glance at it.  
In any case, its better to make a number of versions.  Theres always room for 
further polishing."
<P align=justify>
        I thought I might have left the first draft in the hut.  I had impetuously torn the 
pages out of the exercise book so maybe they were still there  if they hadnt been 
blown 


away by the afternoon breeze that swept up between the rotten floorboards.  
Suddenly we were closer, almost against my will.  The cup of tea, his gentle manner, 
my surprising story.  All right, not all the sons of immigrants will be volleyball players.  
They may be stronger and 
taller than their parents but, who knows, some of them may be drawn to the world 
of books.
<P align=justify>
        "Have you read Chekhovs The Woman with the Puppy?" Dad asked.
<P align=justify>
        When I was a boy I used to devour well-known authors according to the rows 
of 
their books in the library.  How many volumes did Dostoievsky write?  I took them 
all in one lot and read them one after the other.  How many of Thomas Manns 
books had been translated?  I swallowed them all.  And so on, according to time and 
place and the recommendations of my girl friends who were great readers.
<P align=justify>
        "Yes," I said.  "Ive read a bit of Chekhov."
<P align=justify>
        "Excellent," said Dad.  "In that case you will understand what I want to say.  Do 
you remember the frivolous officer and the bored lady?  Do you remember the 
amusing game they played as if it were just to pass the time and enjoy a chance 
meeting?  Then suddenly, in a flash, almost without them realizing it, everything 
turned upside down.  She fell deeply in love with him and he knew he couldnt live 
without her.  You see, thats the genuine 
Chekhov.  He leads you, as it were, up the garden path.  He tells you a slight tale 
about a small platform at a station in a summer resort, a most enjoyable cruise on a 
river boat during a southern summer, and suddenly you know, almost at the same 
time as the characters themselves, that the lives of both of them have become 
dependent on that small adventure.  I call that, Chekhovs point of reversal, and you 
can follow it in every single tale that that wonderful story-teller wrote." 
<P align=justify>


        I listened to my Dad.  It was a long time since we had had such an intimate 
conversation.  But inside I thought, "What have I got to do with Chekhov?  What 
are his be-hatted ladies to me?  What have I got to do with his painful point of 
reversal?  All I 
wanted to recall was one moment of illumination in the cemetery wood after a 
fantasy dream, and to respond to a secret invitation that was sent to me.  I didnt 
want to waste time but to write everything I had felt inside and everything I had 
seen outside.  What kind of 
literature would sprout from that?  I had certainly exaggerated in my description of 
the trees, the leaves, the ground.  I had gone overboard in picturing the rake, the 
hosepipe, the hand that was stretched out to tidy up.  But they had been no less 
important to me at that moment than the nameless but familiar figure that in total 
concentration and disregard had been so absorbed in some kind of ritual that 
riveted my attention.
<P align=justify>
        Meanwhile, Dad continued on his own track, "And here, in this excellent 
Russian 
booklet, some scholar has published a wonderful article on Chekhov.  Never mind 
the point of reversal, thats an old discovery.  Just listen to this original idea," and he 
began to translate straight from the text.
<P align=justify>
        "Chekhov the story-teller has a wonderful quality, the quality of surprise.  You 
never know where his sentence is gong to lead.  You never know how his 
characters will behave.  Will they sink into despair, will they quickly board the 
showboat, will they disappear in the accelerating railway carriage?"
<P align=justify>
        Dad put the booklet down.  He could have gone on reading to me for a long 
time, 
but he noticed that inside I was moving further and further away.  "This world," he 
said, "the world of writing is full and mighty, and if you want to enter, at least know 
what you are letting yourself in for."
<P align=justify>


        My visiting hour was nearly over.  I stood up and began to get ready to go.  I 
gathered the cups and saucers and put the spoons in the sink.
<P align=justify>
        "I would very much like to read the story," Dad said before I left.
<P align=justify>
        "O.K.  Ill check in the hut and see if maybe some of the pages are left."
<P align=justify>
        When I left my parents room, the old questions tortured me.  Is this really what 
my life is going to be like?  Piles of books and bits of paper stuck in the pages to 
mark the place?  Booklets thrown about in every cranny with tea stains printed on 
them?  Translated paper chases after Chekhovs surprised characters?  What kind of 
a paralysed life is this?  Its a barren life.  Where are all the promises of the colourful 
lives of writers?  Where is all the pleasure, the power, the wisdom?  Is this really what 
my life will be like if I join the vibrant chorus of the journals?
<P align=justify>
        On the way to my bed in the rotting hut, at the edge of the abandoned guava 
plantation, I heard a host of voices out of the night.  A whole world of living 
creatures was noisily active under cover of the darkness, and from afar, out of the 
jumble of sounds, I could also make out the bleating of the sheep waiting for milking 
time. 
<BR><BR><HR><BR><BR>
<U><B>IV</B></U><P align=justify>

        Today, sitting at my desk, which is covered with open books with bits of paper 
between the pages marking the place, I am trying to remember without getting 
things wrong.  Many years have passed since those distant days, and when I fall 
into the act of remembering, it is difficult to guess where it will lead me.  

<P align=justify>

        Did I respond to Dads request and bring him the rough copy of my confused 
story?  Did I, in fact, find the pages of my first draft?
<P align=justify>
        "With an ordinary pencil, just like that, straight on to the paper?" Dad 
exclaimed.  
"Its a long time since I saw such a primitive job."  Its hard to remember.  A hurried 
visit to my parents room.  As I come in, Dad puts his glasses up on his high 
forehead.  "Well, did you find it?  Give it to me.  Well read it."
<P align=justify>
        I hastily drop the handful of papers on his desk, cutting the affair as short as 
possible, hardening my heart, trying to make the whole thing seem completely 
trivial.  
<P align=justify>
        "Oh, really.  Its not important.  Im in a terrible hurry.  You can put the pages in 
order yourself, and if one or two are missing, it doesnt really matter.  You can make 
it up.  The most important thing is that Im in an awful hurry.  Tomorrow were taking 
the sheep to the beach for their annual wash.  Im sure I wont sleep at night and well 
come back all burnt.  See you!"
<P align=justify>
        Did my Dad hear these last few sentences that I threw him, or was he already 
immersed in reading, bent over the pages, holding them to the light and gripping 
them as if they were some tool?  Did he answer me, or was it his usual humming, 
telling me that he was already far away?  For even if he had heard my question, and 
even if he had had more than one answer, he was already well on his way to 
another place.  Did he say "Bye, bye!" and add a mild threat, "Wait a minute till I 
finish reading and then well talk"  Or perhaps he asked whether it was true that they 
had returned my manuscript, and wasnt that just like them.  Was it so immature 
that it set the teeth on edge, or had the editors just been too idle to read the untidy 
pages, scratched with a hard pencil and permeated with the smell of sour milk and 
yard manure?
<P align=justify>

        That Saturday, at the table for the afternoon snack, when all the family was 
gathered on the veranda of my parents room, Dad took the pages out of an 
envelope, put them in front of him and said:
<P align=justify>
        "Your awful Hebrew, and where did you dredge up such incorrect sentences, 
and 
why were you so hasty in your descriptions?  Where are you running, man?"
<P align=justify>
        With that he turned the family meal into a whole lesson on the study of writing. 
 As 
he turned over the pages, I was shocked.  The whole lot was completely covered 
with his corrections in red ink, literally poured into the indentations of my pencil.
<P align=justify>
        "I read everything," Dad said, "and not like the editors of the quarterly read it in 
Tel 
Aviv.  Then, when I finished reading it, I read it again, and a third time.  Wow, what 
a lot you still have to learn!"
<P align=justify>
        And I sat in front of the pages and didnt recognize what I had written.  Where 
had 
all the crossings out sprouted from?  Where had all the commas and question 
marks appeared from to stain the pages?
<P align=justify>
        All I had tried to do was bring back to life an elusive sight, a shadow that stole 
away, a breath of wind.  I had no intentions of creating literature.  The only reason I 
had rushed and pushed to send it away to the journal was because I also wanted to 
be among the intrepid of my generation, who had only just taken off their uniforms 
and were already the neophyte poets, those whose poems were recited at night by 
young girls, their blouses dripping with slim volumes of poetry.
<P align=justify>
        "Once," Dad said, "Faustovsky went to visit the famous writer, Maxim Gorky.  
He 
placed his first few stories in front of Gorky who read them and gave his opinion.  Go 
away, 

young man, and live among people for ten years, and after that, write.  Then and 
only then, come back to me and bring what you have written."
<P align=justify>
        Was it because of Dads words on the veranda that evening towards the end 
of 
summer, when my story, slaughtered and bleeding, lay on the family table, that I 
was silent for ten years?  Was he too severe in his criticism of me?  Today, from the 
distance of years, I ask myself whether a childish desire for revenge wasnt born on 
that occasion.  Was that 
the reason that I turned away from my notebooks for so many years?  Was it 
because of the memory of that conversation and those pages that I buried myself 
in the dusty fleeces, the hooves of the sweating sheep and the smelly piles of animal 
feed?
<P align=justify>
        After Dad died, Mom asked me to go through the carton of papers he had left.  
I 
pulled a bundle of papers from among the cardboard files and when I began to read 
I was amazed    .  It was a short note of his in memory of his mother.  Corrections in 
red ink, obviously added in a fit of fury, criss-crossed the typewritten lines.  Not a 
word was spared, not a line had escaped unmarked.  The margins were full of 
endless alternatives and suggestions.  I put down the papers and distant scenes 
suddenly flooded over me.  On the table, between the cups of coffee and slices of 
toast, lay my first story, scarred with the red lines of Dads pen.   
<P align=justify>
        "You know how hard he was on himself," Mom said, as if she had read my 
thoughts.
<P align=justify>
        "Yes," I said.  "He was hard on me, as well."
<P align=justify>
        "Not really," Mom said.  "I remember how pleased he was when your first 
stories 
began to appear in the newspaper."
<P align=justify>


        "True.  But what did he really think?  He was never completely satisfied."
<P align=justify>
        "Silly boy," Mom said.  "You have no idea with what love he followed your 
career.  
He felt that you were writing during all those years when you hid everything from 
us.  He guessed that you were going through a new stage even when you denied 
everything.  You were so closed up it was impossible to get a word out of you."
<P align=justify>
        "Thats not quite true," I said.  "You dont remember any more.  Have you 
forgotten how much he wanted me to be a volleyball player?"
<P align=justify>
        "Ha!  Dont I just remember!" Mom said.  "And I will never forget how afraid he 
was 
that you might fail.  How he worried that someone would turn you off and he 
wouldnt be there by your side to encourage you."
<P align=justify>
        Dad died about a year before the war, and after the war broke out I couldnt 
contain the writing inside myself.  In the end I let the stories burst out.  A few years 
later some editor or other suggested that I prepare a collection of stories.
<P align=justify>
        "You already have some good bricks with which to start the building," he 
wrote.
<P align=justify>
        At first I didnt want to listen.  A book?  Who needs a book?  Arent the stories 
good 
enough on their own?  Still, I listened to a voice inside me, sat down and chose the 
stories for the book.  Dad never saw my first book, but his photograph, which 
always stands on my desk, went with me while I worked.  Was he with me during all 
those difficult hours of organizing?  Did he raise his finger to warn me of the haste 
that mars, of faulty language, of feeble characters?  Did he tell me about Chekhovs 
points of reversal and his surprises, which are the soul of short stories?
<P align=justify>

        Did he ask me how I had spent my ten years of silence?
<P align=justify>
        "Silly boy!"  I can still hear Moms words echoing in my ears.  "You have no idea 
what a stubborn mule you were, or how much he tried to get close to you in his last 
few years.  What a shame that he never lived to see your book."
<P align=justify>
        Now, when I remember that crazy moment on the sandhill at the edge of the 
cemetery, and how the editors secretary made a fool of me, and how I crouched 
down over the grating of the sewage pump, and how my story lay in front of me, 
pierced and reddened by Dads strict pen, I begin to realize how close I was to 
stumbling that summer when I wrote my first story.
