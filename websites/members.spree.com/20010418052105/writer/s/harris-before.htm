<P>Have you ever thought that before you create something you have
to destroy something?</P>
<P>
We hear those words it is all right for them but I'm not creative,
I can't write, draw, paint etc etc. Is this just an excuse you
use to stop yourself from doing something different. To ensure
that you do the same things that you have always done, whether
successful or not.</P>

<P>Before you can move forward you have to destroy your thought
process. But what stops you?</P>

<P>Fear? What are you frightened of? Stop and think for a minute
what is it that you are frightened of.
Failure. The fear that if I try and don't succeed then I will be
damaged in some way. Or is it a fear of trying or a fear of being
out of control? Not knowing what the output is? This implies I
only want to do things that I know I am good at.</P>

<P>Success. If I try something and find I can do it this time will I
be expected to do it again? I might find out how good I really am.
It will alienate me from my friends and colleagues point me out
that I am different. Do I really want to be a web millionaire or
is it all talk. I know I cannot do it really. Is that so? Or is
the fear of success another way of saying leave me alone. I like
it in this comfortable world where everything is routine. I am in
control. I know how it works.</P>
<P>
In these two instances we begin to find that these fears although
they appear to be different come from the same root. i.e. the
fear of losing control. The fear of not knowing.
This is the fear that has to be destroyed before we can enter
into a creative process. Lets look at it for a moment. Are we in
control are we ever in control? Or is it an illusion?</P>

<P>What is control? Is it routine for you? Safety in having a regular
job paying the bills buying a house. Is that control?  Or is that
the life that the banks and society would like you to live because
you are a sure bet and will never cause anyone any problems.  Is
that control or is it living in a box?</P>
<P>
On a recent trip to India a friend of mine was watching a flea
circus and asked the ringmaster how do you train them? It is easy
he said: first catch your fleas then place them in a box at the
height and size you wish them to jump. There is a great deal of
noise as they hit their heads on the top and sides of the box
then silence. Now you have trained your fleas when they are
released from the confines of the box. They only jump to the
height of the box they were in.</P>

<P>Now lets talk about human beings.  Got the message?  When you
became redundant or left your job how high did you jump? Are
you in control or is your environment still controlling you?</P>

<P>If you want to be creative start by retraining yourself. Destroy
the thinking; let go of being a flea and become what you really
are a unique individual who can do anything you please, if you
are willing to make the effort.</P>
