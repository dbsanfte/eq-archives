<P align=justify>
Retard!  Mongoloid!  Hey, Honey, wanna date! are a few epithets hurled at my sister in her lifetime.  The medical term for her is Down's syndrome, also called trisomy 21.  Mentally handicapped, or more likely "client", is given her by the staff members managing the house where upwards to seven atypical people live and strive together under one roof and full time supervision.  
        <P align=justify>The world is an abundantly confusing place to sort into sense by any of us, but for Monique, it vacillates between downright overwhelming or a huge nuisance.
<P align=justify>       Monique was born when our mother was in her 45th year and a second marriage.  This middle age for a woman is a time when the extra 21st chromosome may appear which produces Down's syndrome, and it is a risky age, at best, to produce young.  Yet, God has His reasons for all things, so one May 3rd, Monique came into the world with black downy hair, and a face as cute as any Pug puppy.
<P align=justify>       Down's syndrome people punctuating the human landscape provoke an interesting and spectacular array of reactions from our fellows.  Most altogether forget their social graces and stare in wide eyed silence.  Many turn quickly away as though to cancel what they consider unpleasant...yet this could also be an effort to suggest they judge nothing unusual about Monique...that she's any regular face in the crowd, which of course she isn't.  Perhaps they are simply trying to show acceptance and politeness.  Some are noticeably embarrassed and others are afraid.
        <P align=justify>Once, I was one of these.  Once, I avoided the retarded like a fatal virus.  Once, I stared.  Once, I did not understand.
        <P align=justify>My stepfather was crestfallen over Monique's looks because he is a status-oriented man.  During the early years he insisted devices of hairstyle and clothing be utilized to make Monique look "normal", as he put it.  But nothing worked.  Monique was destined to protrude from the crowd.
        <P align=justify>Over time, I grew accustomed to the startled noticing...the hurried whispers...even the pointing fingers.  There is something mysterious about being an average person and accompanying a Down's syndrome person, however, because there is always an immediate snap of attention from the mentally handicapped person onto the supervising one.  Maybe there is a primal curiosity about someone who is gathered close to these unknown and perhaps to be feared beings.  I remember in the beginning feeling angry about the public's reaction to Monique, and in her defense wrote this ditty:

<BR>



Valiant Sister
<BR>
Do you think she knows she is retarded and uncomely?
          <BR>                  
                            Do you think she notices that her toes and fingers are<BR>
                            extra fat and different looking?<BR>
    
    <BR>                        Do you think she hears the other children whisper as she 
                            passes?
<BR>
                            Do you think they know how gentle is her heart?
<BR>
                            Do you think they know she writes poetry about love between
                            people?
<BR>
                            Do you think they know she tries so hard to share her feelings, 
                            she stutters and can hardly speak at all?
<BR>
                            Do you think they care?  I think they care, but I don't think they 
                    know.
<BR>

<P align=justify>       Then, drop by drop, as the Colorado River once began its great work of carving the world's largest canyon, I came to maturity, and it has been a long time now since I have noticed anyone noticing.
        <P align=justify>Primarily, Down's syndrome people are misunderstood, which is why I take these moments to write, and therefore to you, Reader, goes a glance at one week-end with this special sister of mine.  Monique began that visit by pulling a volume of Shakespeare from the bookshelves.  She lay that great man's book open on the coffee table and plopped into the softness of the adjacent couch, bouncing somewhat as she adjusted herself toward the edge of the bottom cushion in front of the book.  Then leaning in a total studious manner over the words too difficult for the average person to understand, Monique took her large right index finger and began to guide it over the sentences, reading aloud as she went.  Five hours passed exactly this way.  She was absent except for the imaginary world which had captured both her and myself since she was vocalizing the story with expertise and flare to the extent that I was privy to a performance.  She was high theater...soaring and plunging with all the emotion from Shakespeare's pen.  Eating, sleeping, or turning on more light were the only interruptions from her reading, and this was the beginning, middle, end, and sum of Monique's time with me for those two days.
        <P align=justify>Often I've wondered if God, by shutting certain doors, doesn't compensate by opening other possibilities.  Idiot Savants, I've read, have been cited as proof when pondering certain capacities of the human brain.  These Savants, labeled helplessly retarded, are often geniuses at math, particularly at deriving answers from difficult equations and doing so at something like the speed of light.
        <P align=justify>Monique is a Yew tree, rare and important.  Important how, you might ask?  Her very presence demands a response.  She invites compassion and understanding, in place of the Judgmental Disease killing us all.
        <P align=justify>Even though struggles are part of her life simply because she has life, Monique is a walking, thinking, loving human being, and indeed her love poured onto her family over the years like an elixir.  
        <P align=justify>Monique is also a poet.  She graduated from high school through the Special Education department and read one of her poems for the graduation ceremony.  I sent some of her work into a Handicapped Citizen's magazine and those poems were published.  An editor from a different magazine read them and located Monique asking for more work, which was subsequently published in that magazine.  As testimony, I will grace this writing with one of her tender expressions.  She wrote to me just after the death of my dog, Godiva, a canine friend of nearly 18 years.  Monique wrote as follows:

<BR>
A pink flower.......
           <BR>                                                       and she was a petal.
                     <BR>                                          It turned a little black.......
                               <BR>                                   and the wind blew it away forever,
                                         <BR>                      Through the door.......
                                                   <BR>               and the door was closed.


<P align=justify>Monique was the only one to write me a condolence.
<P align=justify>       In many ways Monique is still a kid.  Maybe she always will be.  Maybe we all are to some extent only it shows more openly on her.  She also has an eating disorder.  She lives to eat.  Yes, she has her problems and her struggles and her wins and her losses like we all do.
        <P align=justify>Then along came James, a dark-haired, dark-skinned, foreboding looking young man,  two years older than Monique.  Though theatrically perfect in appearance for the role of Dracula, James is a gentle lamb.  He has been in "homes" nearly all his life.  When they met, Monique was living at a group home in San Francisco.  Clearly, it was James's impersonation of Elvis Presley's "Don't Step on My Blue Suede Shoes" that caught Monique's attention.<P align=justify>
        Though mentally handicapped, in most ways, James looks like a regular guy, which is an arrangement that baffles our world and causes outings with Monique and James to be unpredictable, and frequently colorful.  For example, if we are all out shopping it is not unusual for James to strike out on his own for a while.  Later, we might find him in the throes of bargaining for furniture or a gold watch or any number of exotic items, the salesperson taking James altogether seriously.<P align=justify>   
        Both he and Monique work, they know the local bus line schedules and ride these public systems, they get themselves to and from movies, they drink one milkshake with two straws, they are in love.<P align=justify>
        Five years ago they married in the conventional way with bridal shower, white gown, and wedding reception.   Unfortunately, the law in devilish naivete, does not require Monique or James to be made sterile before their union.  Thankfully, however, maternal pressure did accomplish the feat and Monique's tubes were tied.  This is much to the good since Monique is capable of a stubborn streak and could leave a squalling baby on the outdoor winter porch if it wouldn't mind her admonition to be quiet.  Some laws are absurdly legal.
        <P align=justify>So Monique and James are together...finally and fully.  My heart once ached to see her part of an obscure forgotten collection of unusual people at homes for the mentally disabled...because Monique had unique gifts...and she had dreams...yet her life was stuck in a bleak holding pattern with fuel for evermore to circle and circle and circle in an endless nothing.  Niagara Falls dammed...the thundering exuberance reduced to a dry cliff.
        <P align=justify>Likewise, James was a castoff, a stranded tattered sailor alone on an uncharted island without a parrot or palm tree for companionship.   He wore deep circles into the edge where sand and water meet. Like worry beads his face was a scowl as he darkly pondered his course of no beginning and no end.
        <P align=justify>How utterly kind of God to bring these two unique souls together.
        <P align=justify>James is generous to a fault and cannot hold long onto even a nickel.  He and Monique have closed their joint banking and each has opened an individual account so James can be monitored more closely and helped to better manage his money.
        <P align=justify>While "puppy love" somewhat describes the tenor of their relationship they also have marital hardships and occasionally visit a marriage counselor.  But mainly they seem to know they are together as handicapped persons both, and that rare experience is a bond deeper and stronger than we can ever know. 
        <P align=justify>On a recent picnic, Monique and James both carried on their belts what they called a "marriage saver."  These were battery-operated devices with several buttons to push for a prerecorded voice message.  "I love you," was one option.  "Take the credit card shopping," or "Sure, Honey," were additional choices.  Monique said they hadn't had an argument since they started carrying their "marriage savers," several batteries ago.  There is appeal and wisdom in simplicity.
<P align=justify>       These two giggle a lot and kiss and get mad and make up.  James is usually the first one to say he's sorry.  Monique doesn't let him get away with much. He tows the line a good husband should or he and the rest of the family hear about it.
        <P align=justify>Together, for them the world is a place to understand, not a home to fear.  Together, Niagara Falls runs its course and rainbows glitter in its' casting sprays.
<P align=justify>       Monique and James don't have to worry about oil changes for the car because neither will ever drive a vehicle.  They don't pay land taxes or change the goldfish water.  Many ordinary living responsibilities will never be a concern for them.  But they shop, and cook, and clean, and go to work, and try...especially James...to balance their bank books.  They play and worry and pray and go to church...and they care deeply about one another.
<P align=justify>       Before finishing this personal glimpse, I must share one outlandish act of caring by Monique.  She received word that her father had suffered a minor stroke and since she couldn't find a way to get to the family home several towns away, she hired a cab.  After stopping first at the bank to make a sizable withdrawal from her checking account, she had the driver take her to her parent's door and her father's bedside.
        <P align=justify>Monique and James dream of becoming independent...of some liberating day in the future when they can live in an apartment of their own.  Yet, it may or may not ever come to be.  They may never be thoroughly trustworthy about turning off the stove, or knowing when to call 911.  They may choose pizza and ice cream for dinner every night instead of fruit and vegetables.  They may never be on their own, but at least that is their dream together.  It is good to have dreams and to have hope and to deepen the bond of marriage with a common goal.
        <P align=justify>Meanwhile, my husband, Tom, and I are pleased to have such interesting family, and we are very happy James is now so much a part of it after his many lonely years.
<P align=justify>       We never know when James in one of his vivid theatrical moods will suddenly appear wearing an outlandish wig and make us laugh.
        <P align=justify>Of all, my most genuine hope is that this little rendering shows how true love beats in the hearts of many handicapped peoples, and how worthwhile it would be if these words could cause a mutual response.
