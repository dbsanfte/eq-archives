	<b>
<P>	After three decades of continuous low-fat moralizing, people naturally assume that
     eating fat is always bad for fat people.</P>

  <P>   Is eating fat really always bad for fat people? No. This is one of those gross oversimplifications
     that cause far more problems than they solve.</P>

<P>     Certain kinds of dietary fat are absolutely vital for absolutely everyone - even fat people. Others
     kinds just provide useless Calories you'd do better without. However, as with all the food nutrients
     we discuss in this series, you need to know which kinds of dietary fat and in what amounts.
</P>
  <P>   Certain fats are vital because they contain compounds known as "essential fatty acids" (EFAs).
     These compounds are just like vitamins. Your body must continually get them from food because it
     cannot make them from anything else - and they are essential to life and health.</P>

 <P>    In fact, a lack of enough of these compounds is one of the main causes of fatness. How can this
     be?</P>

     <P>In general, whenever your body runs low on anything it needs to keep you healthy, it triggers
     hunger as its signal to you that it wants you to go eat some food that has some of whatever you
     need.</P>

   <P>  When this happens, if you go eat things that have very little of what you need, but lots of Calories,
     your body will naturally use whatever it gets of whatever it needs - and store the Calories as fat.
</P>
     <P>Then it will quickly run low again on whatever nutrient you didn't get much of and make you hungry
     again as soon as it does.</P>

     <P>Obviously, you won't lose much weight if you allow this pattern to develop.</P>

     <P>Fortunately, it's easy to disrupt the pattern.</P>

    <P> To do it, you simply ensure that you eat food with enough of all the things your body needs to stay
     healthy - except Calories.</P>

     <P>With Calories you make sure it doesn't get enough. Then your body pulls its energy requirements
     out of its ample fat stores, but still has no reason to trigger hunger, because it's not running low on
     anything.</P>
<P>
     In modern societies this kind of dieting is not hard to do. You simply use easily available nutrition
     information, concentrated natural foods, and ordinary generic vitamin and mineral supplements to
     make sure you get everything you need - except those darn Calories.</P>

     <P>How does this apply to the essential fatty acids (EFAs)?</P>
<P>
     There are two known EFAs your body must get from food because it cannot make them from
     anything else - linolenic acid (LNA) and linoleic acid (LA). Your body makes lots of other
     necessary compounds out of each of them.</P>
<P>
     But if it runs low on either of them, it triggers hunger and eating as I've described.</P>
<P>
     Fortunately, simply taking small daily amounts of safflower oil and flaxseed oil will give you enough
     of each of these EFAs - without giving you many other Calories in the process.</P>

<P>     Safflower oil is about 75% LA by weight and flaxseed oil is about 50% LNA by weight. Therefore
     these oils are concentrated sources of these EFAs with relatively few other fat Calories mixed in.
</P>
<P>     These oils are usually easily available in supermarkets and health food stores. They are the most
     concentrated sources of the EFAs, although there are other oils that provide useful (though
     smaller) amounts.</P>

    <P> How much of each of them do you need? Not much. About one tablespoon of safflower oil per day
     provides about the right amount (10 grams) of LA. About one teaspoon of flaxseed oil per day
     provides about the right amount (2 grams) of LNA. For reference, a tablespoon of any vegetable
     oil contains about 120 Calories and a teaspoon contains 40 Calories.</P>

   <P>  Make sure you somehow get enough of these essential fatty acids. This is the only way to prevent
     your body from triggering the diet-destroying hunger that is caused by a lack of them.</P>
<P>
     In my next article, we'll discuss another class of substances that make you fat when you don't get
     enough - but which are also easy to manage when you know how.</P>
