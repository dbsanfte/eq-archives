		<P>It is really hard to be angry when you're naked.</P>

<P>Have you ever noticed that? It is also true that our desire
for self-protection, can create tremendous conflict - both
internal & external. I would like to share with you how two
people, "Bill" and my son John, helped me discover that it's
more fun to be naked, than angry.</P>

<P>I was between speaking engagements taking place in an office
complex with a common conference room. Since the conference
room was without a phone, I asked a stranger in the corridor
where a phone might be, she pointed in the direction of the
nearest office. I entered, noticed the phone on the counter
and, using my calling card, began to make my calls.</P>

<P>As my secretary was obtaining a number for me, "Bill" walked
up and said "Excuse me, can I help you?" As I was writing
down the number, I replied, "Just a moment." "Bill" reached
over and pushed down the receiver button, terminating the
call. I turned and looked at him in complete awe, the anger
welling up within me in microseconds. I will spare you the
exchange that followed; it was brief, rude and most
unpleasant.</P>

<P>Born on July 25, 1997, John is normally most pleasant. Even
as an infant, he taught me. However, when John got angry,
you could see it in his blood red face and flailing limbs.
My wife and I had been frustrated by these tantrums, until
one day, while changing his diaper, I got him naked while he
was angry. He immediately beamed and brightened up. John had
achieved self-discovery; 'being naked was more fun than
being angry.' Slowly I began to realize that within that
simple statement was contained a profound human interaction
axiom; it was more fun to be 'naked' than angry.</P>

<P>Getting 'physically naked' has a dramatic effect on John,
but would get you & I arrested! What I am suggesting is that
when we become stressed, either through confrontation or
'lack of control' internal issues, instead of reacting to
the situation and getting angry, we should become
'emotionally naked'.</P>

<P>Each of us wears an emotional mask for self-protection. This
mask provides a figurative separation from emotional harm
when others attack. We laugh at the 'all-in-fun' put-downs,
participate in 'razzing' people different from us and are
secretly grateful that their misfortune is not our own. This
behavior is not really us, it's our mask.</P>

<P>What would happen in confrontational situations if we got
'naked' instead of opposing the aggressor? What if we
stopped to help that individual discover why they were angry
instead of instantly reacting and escalating our own
intensity level? When we calmly identify the cause of a
conflict, before we get angry, we can then deal effectively
with whatever issue is causing the conflict.</P>

<P>Getting 'emotionally naked' is that solution. This bold step
requires that we must be willing to remove our own mask
first. It is easy to get angry, it takes emotional maturity
to get naked.</P>

<P>So how do we get naked?</P>

<P>First, we must be willing to try. Many of us have spent
years designing our social, workplace masks; removing them
requires courage. Vulnerability is not a commodity our
culture values, therefore we must ask ourselves if we dare
risk openness with others.</P>

<P>Second, when confronted, calmly ask yourself "Why is this
person upset? What have I done, or failed to do, that has
contributed to their anger?" This pause allows you to
separate their anger from yours and identify the source of
their conflict. This pause also demonstrates maturity.</P>

<P>Lastly, never assume anything. Clarify your interpretation
of their barrage with an honest, understanding and sincere
conversational tone. Whatever they do, remain calm and
composed. Seek a resolution that is agreeable to both of
you.</P>

<P>Getting 'naked' takes courage. I lost with Bill not because
he argued better, but because I got angry. Feeling that
anger, I lost my reasoning ability and demonstrated my lack
of emotional maturity. The next time you face a 'potentially
angry' situation, remind yourself, "it is more fun to be
naked than angry.</P>
