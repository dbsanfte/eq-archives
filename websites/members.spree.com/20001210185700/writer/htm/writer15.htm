    <font size=5><B>Reasons For Rejections</B><BR><BR>
<font size=4><font color="#8b4500><font Face="Arial">
        Rejections are numerous for every writer. Be they 
 playwright, poet, novelist, or
cook-book author. We all know the emotional risk, the gamble of the 
publishing world.
We all wish to avoid rejection - here are some ways<br> to do so.<BR><BR>
<img src="/writer/jpg/nativebar4.jpg"><br><BR>

<img src="/writer/gif/silohette.gif"><font color="#b22222"><font size=4><B>
1. KNOW YOUR MARKET-<BR><font size=3> Or hire someone who does, or find an agent
 who does.
Don’t send  haiku to a market who only wants experimental poetry.
 Don’t send a<BR> non-fiction how-to article to a literary fiction
 journal.  Get sample copies of the publications
you are considering submitting to. Many of our clients have attempted
 publication on
their own. Their approach to this amazes me everyday. They act as if
 they are planting
wildflowers - scattering their submissions to the wind and hoping that by luck of Mother
Nature - one seed will take root and grow into a by-line. <BR><BR>

<font size=4><B><font color="#8b795e"><img src="/writer/gif/silohette.gif">2. NO FOLLOW-THROUGH -<BR> <font size=3>Just like the ball player that suddenly 
gets into a slump, 
many writers fail to have any follow through in their swing. In your
 last rejection you had
an editor tell you to send more of your work, or they  told you that
 this particular
piece was “close but no cigar”,  have you followed through? I doubt
 it. If an editor
takes time out of her extremely busy schedule to write you a note
 that says "Please Try
Again" -  then by all means, that is what you need to do - and ASAP.
 Find some  of your
work that is a little better suited for her publication and SEND IT !
  They may still reject
your work, but they may remember you and ask you to submit again, 
or they may accept
the work, or even make suggestions as to  how they feel it could 
be improved. Don’t let a
wounded ego, hurt feelings, or false pride stand between you and 
being published.<BR><BR>

<font size=4><font color="#ff4500"><img src="/writer/gif/silohette.gif">
3. ALL YOU’RE REALLY SEEKING IS TO SAY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN
PUBLISHED -<BR><font size=3>Let’s face it - you don’t really like all the hard 
work that writers must do.
The revisions, the outlines, the synopsis, the query letters - all
 you want is to see your
name in print. You’re a dreamer, a pie in the sky kinda guy. You 
never realized that
writing requires effort. If you actually do see a project through its
 first draft - you submit
it, and then blame the editor for being so stupid in not seeing
your talent.<BR><BR>
<br>
 

<BR><BR>
<font size=4"><font color="#0000ff"> <img src="/writer/gif/silohette.gif">4. YOU KNOW NOTHING OF CRAFT AND DON’T WANT TO TAKE THE TIME TO
LEARN IT - <BR><font size=3> You can turn a good phrase. Your friends tell you you
 have a way with
words. Writing is easy - everyone loves your letters. You’re widely 
read and can
recognize poor writing when you find it. But yet, you have no idea 
of the technique
needed to avoid the mistakes that you find in other's writing.
 Developing characters,
building suspense,  constructing a plot are all things you think
 will come naturally. Well,
they won’t. You need to read magazines, and books on how to write.
 You need to attend
workshops and lectures detailing the fine points of the craft of
 writing.<BR><BR>

<font size=4><font color="#008b8b"><img src="/writer/gif/silohette.gif">5. YOU DON’T READ -<BR> <font size=3>If you want to write poetry you must read 
poetry. Romance is
what you want to write - then reading comic books isn’t going to 
help you much. You
need to be a voracious reader to become an accomplished author.
 Hemingway read 3
hours a day, everyday. Read  whatever you
 can get your hands on and then read more .
Study your chosen genre.<BR><BR>

<font size=4><font color="#8b2323"><img src="/writer/gif/silohette.gif">6. YOU GIVE UP TO EASILY -<BR> <font size=3> One or two rejection slips has you 
 brooding around the
house for weeks.  Many<A HREF="/writer/htm/writer11.htm"> manuscripts </A> take
 up to 50 or 60 rejections before they are
published. In fact, the works of Thoreau or Emerson may never have 
been read if they
had given up as easily as you. After receiving countless numbers of
 rejections these great
authors self-published their works. Zelda Fitzgerald told F.Scott 
she would not marry him
until he became a published author.  F.Scott literally wall-papered
 his room with
rejection slips before he and Zelda actually wed. Most magazines in 
today’s market
only publish about 2 % of the material sent to them, and many of our
 current  best sellers
would have never been published if the writer had given up after a
 dozen rejections. <BR><BR>

<font size=4><font color=#000000"><img src="/writer/gif/silohette.gif">7.  YOU WRITE POOR QUERY LETTERS -<BR><font size=3> A good strong
<A HREF="writer11.htm">  query letter </A> is a great way to
better your chances of selling your work. Many well-written,
 potentially publishable
manuscripts are rejected because of a bad query letter. Many authors
 hate to write query
letters, some don’t even bother to find out if the publisher they
 are submitting to prefers a
query. Writing, and more specifically  - publishing  is a business
 - you must learn, to  sell
yourself and your product.<BR><BR>

<font size=4><font color="#0000cd"><img src="/writer/gif/silohette.gif">8. YOU DON’T BELIEVE IN REWRITTING OR REVISON -<BR><font size=3>If you submit the
 first
draft of your work to a publisher, then you deserve the rejection 
that will inevitably
follow. Many top selling authors go through as many as 20 drafts and
 revisions. <BR><BR>
<img src="/writer/jpg/nativebar4.jpg"><BR><BR>

<font color="#8b4513">There are many more reasons why our work gets rejected, to list them
 all would require a
book in itself. The reasons listed above are the most common ones 
that I see personally
with my clients. The best way to succeed as an author is to know your

market, learn how to handle rejection and criticism, be persistent,
 study your craft, and be
willing to revise. If you falter or stumble in any of these areas
 - you drastically reduce
your chances of ever being published.<BR><BR><BR>
