The Bungee Chord Broke

<P align=justify>
Tonight, the Bungee chord broke.  As often happens in such day to day
phenomena, it's a little insignificant annoyance that kicks off a whole
series of similar minute bothers that ends in not only an avalanche of
physical and emotional excesses, but also in an equal or greater deluge of
curse words, either spoken or withheld.  It started with a minor thing.
Bruce the Engineer decided to help me lash a package that he needed me to
deliver to a neighbor of mine onto the back of my bicycle.  Now ordinarily,
I'm not a big bungee user, in fact, I've always felt as though the stretchy
lash-all is an unfortunate byproduct of our quick fix society.  This, I
feel, is a lofty thought for an 'Ugly American' such as myself living in an
ex-pat community within an Asian society.  Yes, I've always preferred good
old rope or twine, bound with never reproducible knots that take anywhere
from hours to days to untie.  In cities with 15 million citizens, however,
quick fixes are all that can be obtained.  Yet, nonetheless, Bruce the
Engineer didn't even have the decency to at least use duct tape, he bungeed
the aforementioned package to the back of my bike.  This seemed adequate,
until I hit a bump and the bungee chord got loose.
<P align=justify>Now, the bungee didn't just break loose and send everything flying, no, the
bungee chord first dislodged, and somehow defied the laws of physics and
managed to intertwine itself in the spokes and hub of my back tire.  While
this thankfully didn't have the effect of bringing me to a sudden and
unexpected halt, it did provide increased peddling resistance, until the
chord had gone around the hub twenty or thirty times, and was mangled beyond
repair.  Then, the bungee chord broke.  So just when it had done as much
damage as possible to my bike, it let the package on the back loose so that
the papers inside the bag could become disheveled and muddy, since, in fact,
everything broke loose in the midst of one of the larger mud puddles in the
city.<P align=justify>
Now this wasn't like a large puddle in the fashion of Western developed
countries, where the drain pipes occasionally become clogged by some lovely
autumn leaves gone astray.  No, in cities with 15 million inhabitants,
puddles can envelope entire neighborhoods of mud hovels and shanties,
leaving the recently thrown up glass and steel skyscrapers on the horizon as
the only structures high and dry.  These are true islands of man's
achievement, most accurately seen within the reflections of the oceans
around them.<P align=justify>
 The bungee chord broke, and left me with wet teaching materials, as well as
wet feet.  I walked and waded to the nearest dry spot with any kind of light
source, which incidentally, didn't appear for several miles.  By the time I
had found a suitable spot, the tire had, on its own natural efforts of going
around, wore the broken bungee chord enough that the bike was rideable
again.  I took the wet materials, along with the broken bungee chord, and
placed it into the front basket of my own personal paragon of Asian
transportation, and started on my way again.<P align=justify>
 Not long after the bungee chord broke, my chain broke.  The chain didn't
just come off of the sprocket.  No, in fact, one of the links was completely
missing.  This, I soon realized, was just the beginning of my real problems.
Wet shoes will dry, they weren't my ruined teaching materials, and friction
had worn down the misplaced bungee chord, yet no amount of natural spinning
around was going to fix this bike now that the chain broke.  Again on foot,
I started on my way, pushing the bike with its basket full of wet, and
broken items.  I passed from pavement, to smooth dirt, smooth dirt back to
mud, mud to sewage, and then quite rapidly from sewage back to asphalt, all
in the vicinity of a few city blocks.  In cities with over 15 million
people, the spectrum of modern man's amenities can all be fully observed
within a few steps.  A few short steps with wet shoes, broken quick fixes,
and solution-less problems.<P align=justify>
 As Taxi's zip by me, splattering me with whatever it is that is covering
this particular stretch of road, I can't help but feel bad for myself.
Seconds blur to minutes, minutes to hours, as I'm forced to walk further on
worse roads, amidst poorer habitations, and fouler stenches.  Granted I'm
just passing through, but to navigate so tediously this particular course is
very undesirable.  Suddenly above the general din of the city, my ears are
assaulted by the piercing scream of a woman's anguish.  The cries were
delivered with such pitch as to leave no doubt as to their cause.  No one
other than the man, a bereaved father I suppose, who was blankly looking off
into space and holding the screaming woman, seemed even remotely cognizant
of her pain.  Others in the vicinity were just like myself, only able to
focus on the fact that our bungee chord broke, our things are wet, the city
hasn't fixed the road, we can't ride our bike since the chain broke, etc.
In cities of 15 million people, only the mothers cry for children who are
forever gone.<P align=justify>
Things look much different from faster speeds, and higher vantage points.
To walk through an Asian city is to experience a sensory overload.  Between
the constant roar of traffic, the 24-hour construction, humanity in general,
and other contributors to the noise of this strange microcosm, the smells of
incense, and cabbages broiling in old woks, the taste and feel of the always
present grit and grime, the occasional laugh, and the ever present tear, it'
s enough to drive the average person to anywhere or anyplace providing any
form of solitude regardless of expense, inconvenience, or prior state of
mind.<P align=justify>
From the moment the bungee chord broke, this bike ride hadn't exactly turned
out as I had hoped.  It was certainly longer than originally anticipated,
however, when one is walking through what can only be sewage, its never the
most opportune time to consider what it is exactly that you were expecting.
What should have been a 20-minute ride had now been stretched into a several
hour-long ordeal demanding of me more than just leg strength.  It demands of
me my utmost attention to focus on my broken chain, rather than anything
else that may try to shift my focus off of me. This Asia can only be seen in
the alleys and puddles by the light of a pollution smothered moon.  Rather
than walk anymore, I hailed a taxi, to whisk me, with the bungee that broke,
the useless chain, and the wet belongings out of the hot, stifling
environment.  On the way in the Taxi, the air-conditioner broke.
