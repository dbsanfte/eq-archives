	<P>A libra client the other day mentioned that she has been
reading
different diet books and can't decide between "Protein Power", "Eat
Right For Your Blood Type", "Pritikin" "Macrobiotics" etc etc. She
said each one seems convincing while she reads it. Jenny also said
that at the same time she brings in other points of view to not 
feel so "swallowed up" by what she's reading. I think this
illustrates two tendencies of libras:</P>

<P>1) The ability (or handicap) of being completely entranced by 
   something.</P>

<P>2) The tendency to "relativize" or bring in alternative positions
in
order to make everything equal and not have one view be superior
over
others.</P>

<P>We were talking about her desire to find the ONE diet, self-help
method, fashion statement, philosopher etc. Jenny was saying she
hopes to find the one cleaner to throw away all cleaners, the one
recipe book to throw out all her other recipe books etc. It often 
seems this happens- ie she saw an infomercial for quick n brite
where the woman threw away all her other cleaners and just used 
that one. It claimed to clean mirrors, cars, the bathroom, dirty
clothing, shampoo the rug and much more.She got excited and
ordered it. It didn't seem to work in every application
the way the infomercial said and she felt this great
disappointment.</P>
<P>But, she also wasn't sure if she might not have made the 
concentrations up correctly or had the patience to wait . 
(For example,in trying to get out stains in her jeans she didn't
have the patience to let it soak in overnight so she immediately
put it in the washer). This of course brings up the meta-level
point about how the libran can't "wait" often or think of steps
and stages but needs the experience to be NOW.</P>

<P>I think everything is summed up in this example: There's the desire
to finally get rid of all the "multiplicity" , "choices" ,
alternatives", "options" and just find the "one" solution. Is this 
an attempted antidote to the libran love of possibility? This also
explains her attractions to Virgos who seem to be able to assert
ONE view , product or philosophy rather than be tortured by the
many vying for the position.</P>

<P>The desire for finding the "one" is our desire to find what the
mind 
can rest in finally- the self-sufficient. This is a universal
search
and can be seen illustrated in religious literature- The One
without 
a second, the Infinite . We also can hear it in all the love songs 
on the radio: "You are my only one", "I just want to be your
everything". The libra at the same time doesn't want to exclude
what
else exists PLUS doesn't want to get stuck, swallowed up or merged 
completely by something. Other signs often get frustrated because 
while explaining the virtues of one diet to a libra, the libra
starts
saying, "But what about how x says this".</P> 

<P>In returning to the diet books example, we can see how the libra
mind-form is at play: Jenny liked reading the macrobiotics
philosophy because it did seem to cover different foods in each
meal- a little bit of beans, grain, seaweed, seeds etc. But, she
objected that it left out fruit plus seemed  restrictive. She had 
a similar reaction to "ProteinPower"- what about eating 
carbohydrates? What she felt most attracted to was "Eat Right for
Your Blood Type" because it seemed to take account of
individuality.</P>
<P>Types Os have one diet, Type As have another etc etc. What Jenny
liked about this diet was that it didn't say there was only "ONE " 
way. It said some people will benefit from being vegetarians,
other people benefit from eating meats and high proteins etc. 
She also found it explained why some people with heart 
conditions do well with Pritikin principles and others doing 
well eating like Eskimos.</P>

<P>It seemed like this was a mirror of what a libran can like: The
book
that says there is diversity of different types without
recommending
just ONE method or solution. And can Jenny stick to this diet? Her
comment was interesting: "I'm a Type O but I wish I was a type A". 
When we went into why she replied, "because type O's are supposed
to be
carnivores and I don't want to make everything into me". Again, we
see
another illustration of the libran mind-form: If I eat other
creatures
then I'm violating the principle of equality because I'm saying
that I
should live and they should die."</P>

<P>The amazing thing about all of this is that we can get a sense of
wonder
in watching how our minds evaluate, make choices and get excited
about
one trend or another. We use our own inner images all day to look
at the
world and keeping a notebook outlining one's eating habits,
romantic
attractions , favorite writers etc helps us to uncover our
mind-forms.
And since the world is populated by other signs than libra and we
all
are doing this think of the complexity of our
interactions.</P>
