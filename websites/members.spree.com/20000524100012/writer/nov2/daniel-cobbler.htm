      <FONT size="+2">© Daniel 
 <BR> <BR><FONT size="+1">
<BR><P align=justify>
There once lived a barefoot cobbler, a master artisan,
who provided both prince and pauper with the gift
of shoes.
<P align=justify>Within his tiny workshop could be found all sizes,
shapes and styles of handcrafted footwear...
...perfection for every occasion.
<P align=justify>And never a penny was taken, as the shoes were
a sacred gift to all...
<P align=justify>...the cobbler's labor of Love, that those in all
walks of Life might freely exchange the shoes
that had become too small or worn for yet
another perfect pair.
<BR><P align=justify>
Season after season passed as the multitudes
happily traded old for new and always did the
cobbler give to them just the right shoe to wear,
though he remained, himself, shoeless.
And it came to pass that a young man with crippled
feet came into the cobbler's shop in hopes of finding
a pair of shoes that would fit his mangled feet.
<P align=justify>The cobbler's heart was overwhelmed with compassion
for the strugglings of this youth and tenderly did he sit
him down and with his own tears did the cobbler bathe
the deformity of his feet and placed upon them the shoes
of a perfect fit.
<P align=justify>The young man was elated for at long last he could walk
without his pain and he asked of the cobbler how he knew
which shoes were to be his and why it was that the one who
fashioned the footwear for others remained, himself, shoeless?
<BR><P align=justify>
And the cobbler answered with a smile:
<BR><P align=justify>
"The shoes in this humble shop contain the mystery of Life,
and here can be found the perfect fit for every sole.
In truth, these shoes are naught but our own beliefs, convictions,
dogmas and rites which clothe our understanding while
walking upon our chosen path through Life.
<P align=justify>Each one that comes into this shop is seeking the secret of
Eternal Truth,
but each must be given their own unique footwear...
...to wear a shoe too large for your own understanding
will cause you to stumble and fall;
to wear a shoe that is too small will bind the feet and
wither or deform your own understanding of Truth.
<P align=justify>Some forget the purpose of their shoes and become
enchanted with only the beauty that adorns their feet
and proudly do they strut for all to admire.
<P align=justify>And sadly, there are those who come to love their shoes
more than the feet that abide therein and they would cling to
their old worn out soles, declaring its suffering to be a virtue.
Aye, there is a shoe to be found here for every need and
when those needs have been fulfilled,
your understanding will then travel barefoot and unencumbered;
for in that day shall you tread upon Holy Ground."
<BR><P align=justify>
Hearing these words stirred the hidden depths of the
youth's heart and bravely did he hand back to the cobbler
his gift of shoes.
<P align=justify>And in that instant was the youth healed and the cobbler spoke:
<BR><P align=justify>
"Behold, the feet of Perfect Understanding."
