<P>If you had lived during the early 1900s, you probably wouldn’t have known what a heart attack was. Virtually no one ever experienced one back then. Although doctors knew about cancer, a doctor rarely saw a case of cancer. Thanks to diet and lifestyle changes that have occurred just since the 1950’s, these two diseases have quickly become the killers of our day and everyone knows about them.
</P>
<P>Then more recent changes in our diets (better known as lack of decent diets), we are seeing the early signs of another huge health problem.  That problem is vision loss and blindness. The general public has no clue that this is happening. More alarming is the fact that no one seems to have an answer to stopping it. There is a very small handful of opthalmologists who were alarmed at the rising disease set about to do something about it.
</P>
<P>Coming from growing up expecting to be blind in my later years as most of my father’s family is and I inherited the same congenital trait and prepared for the fate of blindness. So I can understand the true gift of sight. I am fortunate in that I had an opthalmologists who would not touch my eyes until he was fairly sure he could do something about it and did. In January I under went one surgery and then another in February and see better than I ever did my whole life. So I recognize that no greater gift could be had than the gift of vision. By that same token losing your sight can be totally devastating and the inability to cope with by a large number of people stricken with that awful fate.
</P>
<P>The problem is, that most of you are sitting here reading this saying it can never happen to me. WRONG, it is happening at an alarming rate and the epidemic is not curable with surgery! The epidemic I am speaking of is “Macular Degeneration.” It is already the leading cause of blindness in the U.S. The situation is far worse in the U.K. I am told. By the year 2025 it is expected that more than 30 million people will have Macular Degeneration…
</P>
<P>Macular Degeneration is a deterioration of the macula, a very sensitive area on the back inner portion of your eye. Light passes through the lens of the eye and is focused on the macula. Then the optic nerve sends visual signals from there directly to the brain. If your macula becomes damaged, you lose the central portion of your vision. You will not be able to read fine print or focus on small details, which enable you to see a familiar face among the throngs. Without realizing it you will not see true colors as they are and many more inconsistencies. The middle loss of vision will become more increased until you only see outer limits of you vision area.
</P>
<P>There are two forms of Macular Degeneration. The most common is the dry form. Small blobs of fatty proteins are deposited in the macular region. These blobs block the small blood vessels feeding the macula, and choke off the oxygen and nutrients that supply this portion of the eye causing blindness. First may appear small middle area blindness and become worse with time.
</P>
<P>The wet form of Macular Degeneration involves the invasion of new blood vessels into the macula. The new vessels leak fluid, which has no place to go. It remains in the eye and permanently damages the macula again causing blindness. This form usually seems to occur overnight when in reality it did not.
</P>
<P>Conventional medicine has no treatment or cure of Macula Degeneration. They only know what causes it and there are several factors.  Smokers tend to be top of the list. Inclusion of fatty diets. Free radical formation. Aging. Regular Aspirin usage. Regular Prescription usage. Artificial sweeteners. Lack of hydration (not drinking sufficient water).
</P>
<P>Alternative medicine has come to the rescue again as found by a handful of ophthalmologist studies in Japan and Italy and Drs. Leland Michael, Ralph Zehner and Merill Allen of the Indiana University School of Optometry. They found that everywhere that the traditional diets still are practiced a very low incidence of Macular Degeneration but in other areas where the modern diets are popular it rages out of control. 
</P>
<P>Besides watching your diet and avoiding drugs, fake fats, refined carbohydrates and aspirin, there is a regimen found to work with Macular Degeneration. Nutritional supplements. Each patient involved in the studies received the following daily supplements. 
</P>
<P>Half in the morning and half in the evening. </P>
Beta-carotene - 40,000 units	<BR>Vitamin E (natural) - 400 IU	<BR>
Vitamin C - 1,500 mg	<BR>	Citrus Bioflavonoid Complex 250mg<BR>
Quercetin - 100 mg		<BR>	Bilberry extract - 10 mg <BR>
Rutin - 100 mg		<BR>	Zinc - 25 mg<BR>
Selenium - 100 mcg	<BR>	Taurine - 200 mg<BR>
N-acetylcysteine - 200 mg<BR>		L-glutathione - 10 mg<BR>
Vitamin B2 - 50 mg<BR>

<P>The use of a Micro-current Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator (TENS) device used in conjunction with the above nutrients saw even more dramatic improvement.
</P>
<P>The TENS unit was used; with the patient holding one electrode in the patients wet hand while the other electrode was gently placed on the closed wet eyelid. The eyes are stimulated for a total of five minutes. That’s 2.5 minutes per eyelid. All the above used for nine months has proved to regenerate the macula and in most instances returned vision in some cases to 20/40. One 80 year old after a 12-year stint of treatment regained normal vision. Dr. Meril Allen is currently working to develop special electrode pads small enough to fit the eyes and also a special TENS unit with the proper setting for the eyes. 
</P>
<P>Do not try this without a doctor’s approval. Of course you cannot acquire a micro-current TENS unit without a prescription. The micro-current units are very scarce as well but at the moment your doctor may order the units from Altoona; 705 2nd Avenue SW; Altoona, Iowa 50009. Micro-850 for $89 and the 804M micro-current recommended home mode for $150. Or from TENS Super-Source Midland, TX 800-234-1238 for information
</P>
<P>This unit is absolutely not intended to be utilized without a doctor’s supervision!!!
