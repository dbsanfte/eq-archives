(FAR GUNS REPORTS. NEAR CRYING OF A CHILD. SUDDENLY IT STOPS.)
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT> But I shan't talk about children. The sky,the city, the twilight. It is large and transparent. Trees between grey and nicely-grieving houses are in a fragile chaos of the  autumn lace. The sky is white-blue as if the water colour were on glass. It is light-grey in the cloudy west. This block was rather calm, nobody shot or made barricades, houses were unbroken yet. Fights went on in the western side, near the railway station. 
<P align=justify>	There were two more blocks to the theatre surrounded with the trees. The green foliage indeed would completely  hide its two storeys in summer. There were neither actors nor spectators there, but some tens of people took their refuge there. 
<P align=justify>	(RIFLE REPORT) The sniper hid behind the opposite corner of the house.  Two more blocks of open space. I jumped over the law fence of the park and squatted avoiding to touch the cold stones with my back.  The damned war...I saw her on TV. A crowd ran across the street. It is a surprise that TV still works here. And it works well though the operator was killed, but the tape was brought to the studio, nevertheless. 
<P align=justify>	Click - and people run, click - and they stand still, click - and they back quickly! (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY.) I couldn't understand what she looked for in this damned city! It is because of her permanent ability to be where it is  needed not to be! One more shot - the wall was a very good shelter, but the instinct forced me to bow. (RIFLE REPORT.) Generally many of my ancestors died of tonsillitis. Ancestors of mother, I mean. I am thinking whether my unknown hunter changes the side. 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT> What are you doing here?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN. </FONT> I am here for some hours,I'm all frozen. Listen, I know you seem to me, but that is because you are in this small and empty theatre, don't you think? 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT>  What "don't you think?"? 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT>  How "what "don't you think?"?"?	
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT>   "Don't you think?" that I am there or that the theatre is small and empty? 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT>   Both. Don't you think so?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT>  You know the second, but I  shan't say the first.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT>   I am going to save you.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT>  And what if I am not there?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT>  But what if you are?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT>  But I am not.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT>  No, you are. (WITH NERVOUS IRONY.) What's about weather? It is fine, isn't? 	
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT>  Yes, it is not too bad.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT>   But it is cold a little.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT>   Probably, it is.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN. </FONT> It was warmer yesterday.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT>  So it was.	
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT>  But what about tomorrow?... Listen, I want to save you!	
	<P align=justify><FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT>  Anyhow you don't love me.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.  </FONT>Why do you think so? I love you!
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN. </FONT>  No, you don't.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT>   I do.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT>  No, you don't.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN. </FONT> I do.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT>  You can't prove that. You can't prove that. You can't prove that.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT>  Should I?	
<P align=justify>	(ENGINE SOUNDS OF CARS APPROACHING AND GOING AWAY.)
	<P align=justify> I didn't know which of them, drivers and passengers, would help. The sniper could shoot everyone who would be too courageous or insufficiently coward. (PAUSE.) Listen, I go to this damned theatre though you aren't there at all!
  <P align=justify>  <FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN</FONT>   But you've said I was.
 <P align=justify>   <FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN </FONT>  Would you be so kind to stop making fun of me? (RIFLE REPORT.) I didn't see him at all because I hid at once when he had shot.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT> So you are going to save me.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT> Yes, I am.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT>  But you love only my body.	
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN. </FONT>  It is the great news for me that you don't like me to like your body. I don't like that you don't. You liked it before. You liked everything. 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN</FONT> (NERVOUSLY.) I would like you to stop. I want you to stop.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT>  You can want nothing, you are my dream.	
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT>   Nevertheless...
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT> So I want you not to know.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN. </FONT>  Don't you want something else? 	
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN. </FONT> May be I shall be  killed, don't you know? 	

<P align=justify><FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT>   Why did you come here? Don't you like your hometown?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN</FONT>  (IRONICALLY). My hometown...
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT>   Forty five.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT>   Sixteen.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT>   Thirty eight.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT>  Twenty four.	
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN. </FONT> Seven.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN. </FONT>  Twenty three.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT>    Ninety six.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT>  Twenty two.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT>  Eighty nine.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN. </FONT> Twenty one.	
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT>  You are winning again! (IMITATES A FLIRTING PHONE CONVERSATION.) Don't you want to say me something? 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN</FONT>  (IMITATES A FLIRTING PHONE CONVERSATION). You know what I want to say.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN. </FONT>  And what?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN</FONT> (ACQUIRING A TASTE OF THIS NEW ROLE). Stop it! "And what?"... What "and what?"?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN</FONT>  (IN HER NORMAL VOICE). It is O.K. (IMITATING AGAIN.) I am waiting.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT>  You'll see...
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.  </FONT>What shall I see? 	
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT>  I've just finished to talk.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT>  It seems to me I guess what you mean.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT>  You needn't guess, you know.	
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT>   I swear I didn't see him since the high school time. Trust me, please!	
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT>  I trust nothing but proofs.
<P align=justify>	(THE GAME IS OVER, THEY LAUGH TOGETHER.)
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN</FONT> (SERIOUSLY). Didn't you really see him since the high school time? (PAUSE.) Why did I think her to be there? It seemed to me: some dark-grey paint is poured on the light water-coloured dome; condensed as a huge and heavy mass it suppresses the fragile glass - the dome is broken, the liquid mass falls down...
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT>  It's going to rain... 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN. </FONT> You imagination is too rich. Don't you listen, "It seemed to me".
<P align=justify> 	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT>  Let's not quarrel... 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT> Oh, Great Glass Dome! It is infinite and can't be named. It is a formless form, an image without essence.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN</FONT>  (ARTIFICIALLY). Philosophy is so interesting...
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN</FONT> (IN THE SAME EMPHASIZED MANNER). Thank you very much for the conversation. I have to go, good bye, see you later. 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN</FONT> (IN THE SAME MANNER). Oh, please don't leave us now.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN</FONT> (IN THE SAME MANNER). No, unfortunately I should go right now. (SERIOUSLY.) No, I am staying.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN. </FONT>In this case I'll go.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT>  No, stay, please.	(PAUSE.) A sudden blow moved naked branches. Something was blown up somewhere. The sniper kept silent, and I was about to lose my patience. (PAUSE.) Don't you know what's behind the theatre?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT>  A market is.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN. </FONT> And what is behind? 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN. </FONT> A railway station may be. 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN. </FONT> And what is behind?
	<P align=justify><FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT>  I don't know.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN. </FONT> But I do. Something else is. Motionless moments of absent eternity. A moment... five... ten...seventeen, twenty, and so on. 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN </FONT> (IRONICALLY.) Philosophy again.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN. </FONT> But you wanted it.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT>  I won't you to wake up.	
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN. </FONT> Woman never knows what she wants. And I want you.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT> But you've said you want me not to want.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT>  I joked. Why don't the guns  shoot? (PAUSE.) The sun sent its rays in through a hole within the cloudy curtain, and its shadow sliding away between trees opened their green variety. I liked to caress her. I dressed her with my caresses, and my desire to undress her increased. But later, when she finished her tuneless shouts, I realized how near and far she was. We approached to each other with painful pleasure... 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN</FONT> (OBVIOUSLY FEELING WHAT HE SAYS). What kind of pleasure?	
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT>  I may be killed. 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT>  Won't you marry me? 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN. </FONT> Why do you need it, I am just with you.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT>  And won't you leave me?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT> No, I shan't.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT> Don't you deceive me? 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT> She wants to live with a man whom she doesn't trust! No, I shan't deceive you. And if I did - you wouldn't need me. But you don't trust me already. 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT> Sometimes you seem to be wild to me.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN. </FONT>May be I am. What's over the dome?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT> Something else you told.	
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT>  Shall I live if I die?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN. </FONT>You shall of course, but you shouldn't.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT> It would be better to wait for a truck and quickly cross the street behind it. And to finish the matter at once. But no car went. Suddenly a far and low noise of an engine interrupted my thinking. (CARS NOISES.) Three trucks appeared from nothing. They approached to the house behind the autumn lace of the trees from the opposite side, and then they stopped.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT> They came to save us from the theatre. Be careful.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT> Why should I be careful if I won't die? Or else you love someone else?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT> Don't be so crazy. 	
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN </FONT>(IRONICALLY). But God speaks through mad person's tongue...	
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT> I don't see anything funny.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT> My words are human, but not divine.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT> I need truth, but not words.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT> I need knowledge, but not truth. 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT> I know the only truth  that you won't marry me.	
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN. </FONT>Yes, it is true, but why don't you like it? 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT> I love you.
	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT> I do. I love myself within you. Come back, please. (PAUSE.) She felt well with me - I knew that. Feeling exactly the frequent and invisible changes of her mood I was now sharply passionate now shyly gentle. I accompanied her playing my different roles so well that I didn't know what was real.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT> Stop your buffoonery! "She... she..."
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN</FONT> (SERIOUSLY). As you like it. I just can everything. What's after? Sunny slices danced on the wall of the opposite house. It was a mirror brought and broken. People were going out sitting into the truck's bodies. (SERIOUSLY.) Even if you were there, you aren't now. I've lost time! 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN. </FONT>With me?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN. </FONT>Oh, I don't know, I am confused. But you aren't here!
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT> I don't think so.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT> But who is there?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT> Not me...
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT> But who? 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN</FONT> (GENTLY). And then we sat in the kitchen drinking coffee and talking.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN </FONT>(ANGRILY).And then we sat drinking coffee and talking in the kitchen! And the same with everyone before and after! Like a theatre, and nothing more! 
<P align=justify><FONT color="#0000FF">
	YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT> Listen, may be the sniper is gone.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT> What if I cross the street quickly and attack the sniper? Cross and attack. I even don't know who is there.	
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT> Wait for a truck to cross, please. Or else it would be better for you to go back through the park? 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN. </FONT>"For you"? 
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT> No, for us.  
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT> Does she love me? I'll marry her. But does she love me? And why does she love me if she does?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN</FONT> (GENTLY). Keep cool.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT> The sun set down. Short-sighted useless traffic lights looked ahead. It would be dark soon, and they would throw coloured stains  to the pavement and dig deep black ravines in a red trunk. But really who is this invisible sniper? Whom shall I kill? Whom shall I think about if I survive?  But I should stop this awful infinite sequence of masks and find a final form.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT> Tell me, don't you want to kill me?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN</FONT> (CALMLY, NOT SURPRISED BY HER QUESTION). No, because I know you, but the sniper is unknown. And may be that's why I should kill you. You exist in my soul already, let you be there. Oh, what am I saying!
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT> You do.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN. </FONT>Yes, I. Even if I were blind, surfaces would bring me boredom. But I am grateful to you for everything happened, aren't I?
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN.</FONT> And me too.	
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT> However it may be, we shall go back together through the park, shan't we?
	<P align=justify><FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG WOMAN. </FONT>Yes, we shall.
<P align=justify>	<FONT color="#0000FF">YOUNG MAN.</FONT> We shall live feeling each moment of time as it passes by. Life is a play, an infinite play, an infinitely interesting play, and this sniper plays with us, too, and he isn't dangerous! (RIFLE REPORTS. BROKEN GLASS NOISE. SLOW DANCE MUSIC.)
