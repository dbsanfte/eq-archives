	<P>We walked together towards  an ultimate challenge.  A rock
climbing wall 44 feet tall.  I saw it looming ahead, slowly realizing
what we would be asked to do next.  I was not particularly concerned,
because I knew I would be able to take on my normal stance: 
cheerleader, encourager, both feet firmly on the ground supporter 
of whomever would take the roll of victorious climber.</P>

<P>Feeling triumphant, I donned the rock climbing gear.  Yes, I have
on my cheerleading garb, I thought to myself.  It dawned on me:  
we were all expected to at least attempt to climb the wall.  I set
my sights on the first platform, about 15 feet high.   Surely that
would show my willingness to participate in the group event.  It
only  required  I venture marginally  outside my vision of my own 
abilities.</P>

<P>Rarely are people who are seeking significant life change challenged
by setting their goals too low.  In fact, the contrary to this is
normally the case.  Right?</P>

<P>Think for a moment, though, if this is actually the truth.  Do you 
set your sights upon that which you are capable to achieve?   OR
do you instead settle for that which you have been lead to believe 
you are capable to achieve?</P>

<P>I had eyeballed the wall beforehand, to see which route to take up
the wall. I noticed during my first trip it  was really not that hard
at first. My larger concern was my friend who was upon the wall 
above me, who had stopped and was wanting to come down.  As 
is also a usual role for me, I made the decision to come off the 
wall, so my friend could easily and swiftly get down.</P>
<P>
The person "on my belay" (a rock climber's constant support and 
safety system) said to me, "You do not even want to know how close
you were to getting to your next hold."  At that point, I really did
not want to hear.  I did know I wanted another chance to fulfill my
goal of arriving at the first platform.  None of my peers had reached
it yet.</P>

<P>For my second climb, I simply started up the wall.  One hold 
before the next simply and easily.  There was no one immediately 
above me nor below me.  Before I knew it, I reached my goal.  I
looked up, towards the top.  In a split second, I made the decision.  
I was going up.</P>

<P>The decision, while simple, was actually monumental.  I am not a 
particularly athletic person.  Remember, I am great at being 
supportive of the people achieving amazing physical feats, not 
being an active participant.  I stood there, held on to the wall and 
said a silent prayer before stepping off the platform to the next 
few holds.</P>  

<P>Not looking down, I called out for verbal cues.  I made some fancy
moves with my feet.  I reached the second platform.  I cried, prayed
and sang in my head as I thought, "Just get to the next platform.
Just the next one."  I looked up, and asked my helpers below for 
advice and encouragement.</P>

<P>As I climbed higher, I became critically aware that I was not alone
in any of the climb. I had my partner who was "on my belay".  As 
I would reach up with my hands and lift my leg to the next hold, 
he would tighten the cord, literally lifting along with me.  I also 
had the power of prayer, time to pause, and moments of quiet 
singing as I got to each platform.  I also had the leverage of my 
own fierce determination.  I had a lifetime of believing I was not 
physical that I was battling to overcome.  I had many hours of
negative self talk telling me, "I can't do X, I can't do Y, I can't do
Z because I am 1, or 2, or 3."</P>

<P>The wall had become symbolic of all I had wanted to do, yet 
believed I could not do because of my own self imposed limitations.
In that quick decision on the first platform I decided I was no longer 
being a participant in my own destructive beliefs.  I was going to 
become completely, fully an expression of my destiny. </P> 

<P>After being the first of only two from my group who reached the
zenith, I was literally giddy with the feeling of accomplishment.  
The man on the belay said, "What are you going to do next?"  My
response?  "ANYTHING!"</P>

<P>The wall taught me many things.  First, I sometimes aim too low 
because of false beliefs I have continued to perpetuate in my life.
Second, I have an amazing support system in place if I am willing
to share my control with them just as when the belay assisted me 
in  each of the higher holds.  Third, remembering to pause, pray,
and express powerful emotions at each platform filled me with the
necessary strength to continue the climb.  Without each of those 
components, I would not have made it.  In day to day living, doing
each of these activities is crucial to living a full, complete, destiny
filled life.  Finally, in each decision I make, I am either saying YES
or NO to possibilities.  In saying NO, I am saying NO to unbelievable
growth.  In saying YES, I can fully embrace that I can do "ANYTHING!" 
</P>
<P>And if I had "fallen off" the wall?  I would have been safe and 
protected.  I would have tried again.</P>

<P>YOU can do anything.  Live Passionately, Today!</P>
