	Ever read a passage like the one below?

<P>Beyond the shadow of a doubt, if you want to climb the
ladder of success and find fame and fortune, with all other
things being equal, it is a fact of life that you must work
long and hard, and keep your fingers crossed that you don't
land in the wrong place at the wrong time. If you follow
this tried and true rule of thumb, you will sooner or later
enter the land flowing with milk and honey and be allowed to
bask in the limelight of your success.</P>

<P>Surely, that's the most boring piece of writing you've ever
read. If it's not, you need to change your reading habits.
Why is this passage so bland and meaningless? It's full of
clichés!</P>

<P>Clichés, or trite expressions, are phrases that we have
heard repeated so often and read so many times that they
have become meaningless. We don't really "hear" them when we
encounter them in our reading.</P>

<P>Obviously, words serve a purpose. They communicate. They
create a mental image of our thoughts. They verbalize what
we want someone else to visualize. Clichés destroy that
vision.</P>

<P>Clichés, when originally penned, were often crisp, clear,
unique thoughts. They said something many people felt in a
way that most people had never considered. That's why they
became clichés. They were so well received because they
stated clearly what we wanted to express. So, everyone used
them. Sort of like slang. What is considered slang today,
can easily become a cliché tomorrow.</P>

<P>Remember, "Where's the Beef?" The world went crazy over that
phrase. But now? It sounds dated and trite.</P>

<P>What about "Just Say No." When (was it Nancy Reagan?) coined
that phrase, it was fresh and original. Kids hadn't been
told until then that refraining from drugs was so simple.
Everyone thought, "Why didn't I think of that?" Today, it's
overused and has lost its impact.</P>

<P>What about "Content is king," or "Been there, done that," or
"Got...?" There are many other examples like these, but I
think you understand.</P>

<P>Clichés weaken your writing. They give the impression that
you haven't clearly thought about what you're trying to say.
If you want to communicate a fresh idea, you must use fresh
language. If you want your writing to come alive, you must
use language that is alive. Clichés are dead.</P>

<P>No one expects you to be completely original with every
sentence, or to amaze your readers with your creative
abilities, but you need to help your readers visualize what
you're saying and feel what you want them to feel. This is
done through fresh language that says what you mean. Clichés
don't say anything, because they're often not even "heard"
with the reading ear.</P>

<P>So, how do you eliminate clichés from your writing?</P>
<P>
1. Learn about them. Learn to recognize clichés when you see
them. Find a good reference book. (The Thesaurus of
Alternatives to Worn-Out Words and Phrases by Robert
Hartwell Fiske is a good one. It's out of print, but Amazon
might be able to locate one for you.)</P>

<P>2. Once you recognize them, look for them. Be aware that we
often speak in clichés, and since much of our writing,
especially online, is in a conversational tone, it's easy to
transfer those worn-out phrases to pen or keyboard. Make a
focused effort to eliminate them from your writing.</P>
<P>
3. When you find clichés in your writing, reword them. Use
your own language, your own choice of words to say the same
thing. Often, even a simple change can make a much more
powerful, forceful statement.</P>

<P>When it's all said and done, there's no getting away from
the fact that clichés and trite expressions should fall by
the writing wayside at all costs.</P>
