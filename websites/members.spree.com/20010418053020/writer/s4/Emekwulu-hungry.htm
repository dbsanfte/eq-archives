	<P>My desire to write a book started when I was a teacher at Uga Boys' High

School in Uga, Anambra State, Nigeria. In some parts of the world, people

with such a desire are classified in popular language as "hungry authors."

This caused me to remember what an employer told me one day when I was

filling out a job application. He told me pointblank that the job openings

were available but he employed only hungry people. I asked him why. Guess

what he told me? He said because hungry people are the people who get the

job done. With my students' enthusiasm, and moral support, I was encouraged

to carry out their wish.</P>


<P>
Because of Hunger</P>



<P>By being hungry a writer starts producing acceptable material. By being

hungry, writers of different cultures, in different parts of the world,

have produced remarkable works of fiction and non-fiction. Some of these

have been best-sellers from local and international standards, and some of

these writers have won different local and international awards. I later

learned that it was by being hungry that Terry McMillan and Alice Walker

ended up being New York Times best-seller writers. I also later learned

that it was by being hungry that Harvey Mackey wrote Swim With The Sharks

Without Being Eaten Alive , a book that was published in February 1990 and

by March of the same year sold 2.3 million copies; that it was by being

hungry that Isaac Asimov bequeathed to mankind his science fiction stories,

despite his early rejections by New York Giants. By being hungry, many

great works of fiction and non-fiction have been created. Being hungry, I

think pays in the long run. What do you think?
</P>


<P>My moment of truth came June 6, 1982 when two of my friends gatecrashed me

in my living room. They saw me with sheets of paper and a pen on hand.

</P>

<P>"What are you doing?" One of them asked.</P>



<P>"I am writing a book," I replied.</P>



<P>I went on further to explain the book in terms of its content, style, and

audience. They listened with rasp attention. I could tell by their facial

expressions that they wanted to hear more. Another friend had told me

earlier that any book written about any subject is a mere repetition of the

concepts and methods already discussed in another book on the same subject

and for the same grade level. However, my friends were not doubting the

successful completion of my dream book. Within me there was a burning

desire to write. Within me I knew I had a dream, a message, a new unique

approach to conventional classroom concepts.</P>



<P>US. Senator Albert J. Beveridge of Indiana once told members of the YMCA in

Chicago: "Young men, there isn't a thing in the world you cannot do if you

believe you can. Now,I know that if it was my desire to actually write that

pamphlet, I had to face it with all the positive mental attitude (PMA) I

could. What does this mean? It means closing my ears to negative advice and

destructive criticisms from some of my friends, relatives and others. Don't

get me wrong. Other people's opinions are helpful at times. But you have to

be careful how you accept such opinions for there are some people out there

who don't want you to go beyond their level of achievement. Facing my

writing with PMA further means subjecting myself to all forms of

self-denial if and when necessary. It further means going through trials

and tribulation.


</P>
<P>Whose approval are you waiting for before you start to write your book? Are

you waiting for your parents', your childrens', your boss', your

co-workers', your neighbor's etc.? You do not have to wait for the approval

of anyone. Why? Because you are a unique individual. Writing is a form of

expression. It is an embodiment of your interests, talents, abilities,

experience and so on. It is an expression of your individuality.
</P>


<P>I believe that at times people should be left alone to pursue their dreams

in line with their thinking, interests, talents, abilities, and experience.

To do otherwise, is to neglect the uniqueness in human beings. It also

stifles creativity.</P>



<P>Look at these questions. Presently keep the answers to yourself. How many

of you have ever thought of writing a book? How many of you have ever

submitted a manuscript to a publisher? Do you think you have special

knowledge, skills, talents, training etc. that you will like to share with

others? Are you a teacher and you have an unusual but creative ways of

presenting ordinary classroom concepts? Are you currently a speaker, a

seminar presenter and you don't have a book yet on what you speak about? Do

you write articles for newspapers, magazines, etc.? If your answer is

"yes", have you ever thought of building a book from your articles?
</P>


<P>Do you have an idea for a book but don't know how to articulate your ideas

or don't have the discipline to put your ideas together? Have you ever

thought of collaborating with someone on a book project? Are you a good

story-teller? Can you tell stories that can hold people's attention for

hours on end? Do you have ideas or a cause you would like to be remembered

for? Has your book ever earned a rejection from a publisher? Have you ever

felt like writing a book after a dream? Are you a graduate student? Why not

explore the opportunity of turning your thesis/desertation into a book?
</P>


<P>If you answered "yes" to at least two of the above questions, you need to

write a book. How do I know? Because your answers said so. Start now to

visualize your book. Build a dummy of it and put it under your pillow. Why?
</P>
<P>Why not?</P>



<P>"Write that Book" is a seminar designed to inspire people to express

themselves through the power of the pen. Who am I trying to reach with

this? I am addressing newspaper and magazine editors, war veterans,

doctors, university professors, educators, business men and women,

chiropractors, retirees, football and soccer stars, talk show hosts and

hostesses, military men and women, undergraduate and graduate students,

literary agents, prisoners of war (POWs) actors and actresses, attorneys

etc.</P>



<P>Write it Now!</P>



<P>In fact, if you are among the thousands out there with a talent, an unusual

experience, special training , skills, or knowledge to share with others, I

am talking to you. If you belong to this set of people, (yes, you do) write

that book and don't just talk about it.</P>



<P>"Yes, I want to write a book, but now is not the time. I am not ready yet."

No!, No!, No!, No! Now is the time. Don't wait for conditions to be perfect

for they will never be. Stop procrastinating.</P>



<P>I look forward to seeing your manuscript which with excitement, patience,

goal setting, and motivation could be transformed into a book. Good luck!
