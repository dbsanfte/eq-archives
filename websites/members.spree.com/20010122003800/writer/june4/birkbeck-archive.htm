We wall ourselves in
stone by stone
and we dig our own
deep dungeons
yet it's others
we prefer to blame
it is of this we make
our own private hell

"Hell is still Hell."

I mutter and toss
in the bed in the
ratty little hotel
and the rainy dark
drips steady from
the black sky.

Tumults of lust
in the nextdoor room
a man and a woman
groaning    grunting
rusty bedspring music
steady quartertime
and at last . . .

a few quick shrieks
in descending decibels

. . . silence

again I pick up the phone
at my bedside and again
busy signal busy busy
busy-- and again
ten minutes pass
no answer  no answer

no answer
and sounds of lust begin again
far away in another
country.

Running to and
from hidingplaces,
standing still
in frozen posture,
disguised as
an upright corpse;
and maybe the the new
barbarians will
pass by even the
poor old lady
next door to the rectory,
just past her
nintieth birthday,
dry and virginal.

She was nailed
in the crossfire
of electromagnetic
orders from across
the universe
and she seemed
relieved because
sin was no longer
her responsibility,
and from then on
it was okay to
be horny-- but
first she must wait
for the signals
to take over
her cerebellum ...

Free at last!

Everyplace he goes
looks like very place
else he's ever been

sometimes he wonders
if he should have left
the last place after all

he wonders what's the good
of all this moving around
always changing his geography

never changing situations
of always being out of step
always having to move on

but a guy'd be smart to
keep on moving if he owed
money to everybody and

then forgot who they all are
which is easy to do because
everybody is a lot of people

somewhere else must be better
than it is here because here is always
here no matter where it is

A little dance off the
exit ramp and evening neons
are blinking up

in this town I left
these many years ago
behind burnt bridges

and now I sneak back to
under cover of darkness
disguised by old age

and all's well in a
neverworld re-entered
from a far-off dream

but awake at last and
still knowing those faces
that never had names

I ghost around
the familiarities of
re-worked streetscape

I know this place
somehow
and am lost here.

She said she would meet me at
     the same place at 18:00 hours
so next day I went to wait for her
     by the statue
of some Visigothic horse god
engraved on the backs and forths
     of their coins
but she never showed up and
     I was afraid to leave for fear that
she would arrive just seconds
after I'd gone
     so
I kept on keeping on waiting
     but she never came
but any loss of my dignity was
dampered somewhat
     because
I didn't even remember her name
or even who the statue
     was named after.

Colonizing

ridges knolls

English home counties
mobius strips

toward The Beast

the doing of
slow dope

A series of
electromagnetic

jerked them onto
the Southside bus
lulled enroute
to a trailer fulla
Goodwill furniture
bare walls
bare lightbulbs
hanging stark
suckin on a
2-litre bottle of
death sugar
mixt into raspberry-
coloured water
a-gape at streaked windows
looking out across
playgroundsful
of pagans masturbating
a big sheperd dog
if not crash-coarsing their
aggresive skateboards and
scaring prim walkers-by.

was it what savages do
when not running murder races
or freeing themselves
from wonder with
quick-fermented daydreams--
