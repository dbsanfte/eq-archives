<P>It happened about thirty years ago, before the slickers from
California
bought up all the land along the Rock Creek and turned it into
condominiums. In those days the Locals would gather around  the
stove in
Clem's Feed Store late in the afternoon to recount the days
successes on
the  Rock Creek.  There were tales of victory and tales of woe, but
there were always tales.</P>

<P>One afternoon a balding bespectacled fellow of middle age, with a
tweed
coat and those gold rimmed glasses that keep sliding down his nose,
ambled in and introduced himself as Professor So and So from the
private
university down the road from Rock Creek. He inquired as to the
possibility of success in the local stream, with trout clearly on
his
mind. Clem warmed up to "the Perfesser" immediately and after
several
rounds of "Hello, how are you?" from the bottle Clem kept under the
counter, and "fine, thank you very much" from the flask the
Perfesser
kept in his coat, both men were laughing uproariously and making
plans
for an early morning rendezvous.</P>

<P>"That's probably the last I'll see of him" Clem said when the door
closed behind the Perfesser.</P>

<P>"No way he'll make it. He may not find his car." One-Handed Mike
and
John the Liar agreed.</P>

<P>"I'll bet if he does show up he'll have a gob of worms and a
spinning
rod."</P>

<P>Not a dissenting opinion was heard.</P>
<P>
Just at daybreak the next day, a crowd of locals alerted by John
the Liar filled the window of the Daisy's Highway 66 Cafe across from
Clem's. They wanted a good look at this Perfesser fellow, but no
one wanted to be real obvious about it. About 15 minutes after sun up
the Perfesser shows up in his vintage European convertible with the top
down. He is still wearing roughly the same clothes from the previous day
with the exception of a well-worn hat covered in hand tied flies.
From behind the seat, the Perfesser extracts a wooden case which he
carefully unlocks and extracts his handmade split bamboo fly rod with an Irish reel. He
carefully selects his tippet and removes his hat and after much
consideration, chooses a fly. The Perfesser pulls on his thigh high
waders and with a clomp of his boots, stands up. Clem opens the
door to the feed store as if on cue. The Locals  in Daisy's are
dumbfounded. This Perfesser looks like he is serious about his  fly fishing.</P>

<P>Clem is bedecked in his customary overalls and old work boots.</P>

<P>"I ain't going wadin'. I'm going fishin'!" he exclaims with a snort
and
a howdy. Thus girded, Clem and the Perfesser head for the Trestle
Pool,
200 yards downstream from where they started. The crowd of Locals
follows.</P>

<P>After a couple of good false casts, the Perfesser lays his handsome
Royal Coachman about three feet from the top of the bridge piling
and
let the current pull it around. BAM! A 12" Brook trout takes it on
the
first pass. A fight of several minutes ends with the Perfesser
holding
his catch aloft to the appreciation of the watchers and lets it go.
In
response Clem hunkers down and pulls his Garst cap down a little
lower
and casts to the riffle about 40 yards upstream from the bridge. At
the
bottom of the riffle, a trout almost the equal of the Perfesser's
latches on and Clem lands him with the quiet ease of a man who has
fished the Rock Creek many times before.</P>

<P>The Duel is on!</P>

<P>One-Hand Mike opens his book and the wagering begins. There were
bets on
tally, weight, total, first wind-knot, first break-off.  This will
keep
the Locals amused. By mid-afternoon, the fishing slacks off quite a
bit.  It is Clem who suggests that they travel to the Throne Pool
and
visit the King. A gasp arises from the Locals. If the Perfesser
grasps
the gravity of the suggestion, it fails to show on his face.</P>

<P>"That sounds like a wonderful idea."</P>

<P>John the Liar tries as hard as he can, but he can't remember the last
time Clem wanted to take a crack at the King. It is an accepted fact
that the King is the king of all trout in the Rock Creek and his home
pool, the Throne Pool, got its name from the porcelain fixture Clem
threw in frustration at the trout that broke his heart. When Clem
was a younger man, he was quite the fisherman. He would ply his efforts
up and down the Rock Creek, generally avoiding the overgrown pool just
below the old mill dam. The overhanging trees and the steep banks made
casting nearly impossible and you had to stand in midstream at the lower
end to cast, generally muddying up the waters downstream. After exhausting
every other pool for two miles each
way, Clem decided to give it a shot.</P>
<P>
His first three casts were break-offs in the trees. A lot of wrist and a
quarter-cast were required. His first fly hit the water not 40 feet from
himself. The water erupted and the Legend of the King was born. Every
day for two years after that, Clem fished for that King of All Trout,
only to fail to get a rise. Sure, there would be others who would
stop by the feed store with stories of mayhem and destruction at the
hands of the King, yet none could land him.  He was a monstrous fish that
defied all fishermen.  After another fierce battle, won again by the
quarry,
Clem vowed to never fish for the King again. And for the years
after
that until now, he has kept his word. He learned not to flinch when
some
kid would swagger in with a tale of woe and  the story of the big
one
that got away. He had given up on the King.</P>

<P>For the Locals the surprise was complete. They were whispering and
jostling. This would decide the duel once and for all. More wagers
were
made.
</P>
<P>By the time Clem and the Perfesser made it to the Throne Pool, the crowds had gathered on the Mill side, peering through the
overgrowth as best they could. The two men stood side by side at the streams lower end. Each man would have to take turns, the stream was so tight
here. The Perfesser gestured that Clem cast first. His first offering created a big boil in mid pool and the
people gathered to watch who had their eyes on the Perfesser saw him jerk upright like he'd been promoted in the back side with an
electric prod. Clem could not will the fish to rise again and had to relinquish the casting side to the Perfesser. The Perfesser removed his cap
and tied on a Red Runt with a garish black trailer. He removed his glasses and cleaned them with the kerchief in
his pocket. He adjusted his footing and began to false cast in the same quarter stroke that his new friend Clem had. His great red and
black bug landed a good 30 feet farther upstream from Clem's. No one breathed
as it slowly drifted down to the point of the first boil. The strike itself was anti-climatic. The King just rose up and sucked down that
god-awful fly without hardly a ripple. Now the fight was on. Five minutes became ten. Fifteen minutes became 25. A full thirty minutes into the
fight, the King shook his head, broke the tippet, and swam away, entirely nonplused by the whole affair. The Perfesser was crestfallen. Clem
looked like he was fighting back a smile while trying to console the
Perfesser. Back to the feed store they trudged for an afternoon and
evening of drinking, condolences, and tales.</P>
<P>
The Perfesser swore vengeance. Try as he might, Clem could not
change
the Perfesser's mind.</P>

<P>"I will wager $500 dollars that I will CATCH and LAND the TROUT
known as
the KING within thirty days!" the Perfesser challenged the
collected
Locals.</P>

<P>Not a word was spoken until One-hand Mike said, "I'll take $200 of
that."</P>

<P>Quickly pockets were checked, and a full $500 was laying on Clem's
counter. Clearly it made an answer to the Perfesser's challenge.
The
Perfesser was prepared. He opened his coat, removed his leather
wallet
and lay five $100 bills on top of the pile of crinkled money. And
without another word, nodded his head and left. Moments later the
men
inside heard his vintage convertible fire up and roar off.</P>

<P>"That's the last we'll see of him," crowed One-hand Mike.</P>
<P>
"I highly doubt that," was all Clem could muster as a reply.</P>

<P>Twenty-nine days passed without so much as a whisper of the
Perfesser
being heard in town or the feed store. On the morning of the
thirtieth
day, the throaty roar of a vintage convertible could be heard
outside
Clem's just after 9 a.m. Word spread quickly and a crowd of Locals
had
already gathered at the Throne Pool when Clem and the Perfesser
made
their way upstream.</P>

<P>The Perfesser pulled the ugliest red fly anyone could remember from
his
cap. It looked like a second graders attempt at making a
caterpillar
from yarn and wire. Chuckles were heard from the bank. Clem had his
hand
over his mouth to keep the Perfesser from seeing him smile.</P>

<P>The Perfesser took one false cast, two false casts, and then BANG.
The
water erupted and the King was hooked. The Perfesser fairly horsed
that
fish towards him. His singularity of purpose was evident. The
action
took less than 5 minutes. The Perfesser reached down and bellied
the
largest fish anyone in those parts had ever seen. Even the birds
were
silent.</P>
<P>
But the King was not royal. He wasn't even a trout.  He was a
pretender.
He was a CARP for cripes sakes!
The Perfesser dropped the fish back into the water without a word
and
walked downstream to the spot in the bank he could hoist himself up
to
gain access to the road. He walked to his car in silence, as did
Clem,
the Locals and the rest of the folks gathered to watch.</P>
<P>
Back in the feed store, the Perfesser was gracious in defeat.
Though he
had caught the fish known as the King, the wager was that he would
catch
the TROUT known as the King. Condolences and hands on the shoulder
did
less for the Perfesser than the whiskey pouring from
behind Clem's counter. Kind words were spoken and Clem said not a
thing.
The morning turned to afternoon, and slid right into evening.</P>

<P>"How'd ya do it?" Clem finally asked. "How did you catch that big
bugger?"</P>
<P>
Until that moment, no one else had thought of how painless it had
been
for the Perfesser to land the King. The Perfesser confessed. Every
morning for the last month, he had been arising before dawn and
parking
on the county road, beating a path to the Throne Pool and chumming
that
fish with salmon eggs. He had trained the King to rise to the red
of
those succulent salmon eggs. The garish fly he had used was
designed to
specifically mimic a string of salmon eggs. Instead of a tippet, he
had
used a length of fine piano wire. He had tilted the table in his
favor
and only Clem had sensed the scam. But it was the Perfesser had
been
scammed by the King.</P>
<P>
Laughter broke the stunned silence. Finally it was agreed that the
fish
the Perfesser had caught though impressive, was not the King, who
was
indeed the King of Trout on the Rock Creek. The real King was still
lying in wait. And for that day, he remained safe from the efforts
of
the Perfesser, Clem and the Locals.</P>
