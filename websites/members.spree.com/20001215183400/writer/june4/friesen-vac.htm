	<P>Need an alternative vacation idea? Something 
opposite to seeing more big cities with malls 
full of people, all with hands out for your money?</P>


<P>Need to renew your spirit where it is just you on 
this big rugged earth-ball, and God up in Heaven? 
A place where it is easier to ask Him earnest 
questions directly and expect to sense a reply?</P>


<P>(Gulp!) Calls for a wilderness place, doesn't it?
But you need a good quality bed at night, and some 
basic amenities. Where!? How does one insure such 
a spiritual renewal really happens?</P>


<P>May I make some suggestions? </P>


<P>Thank you.</P>


<P>If you already do journalling most every day the 
need to get the main points of your life worked 
out will not be as urgent. Instead you might start 
with re-evaluating your priorities.</P>


<P>If you're new to this, plan a vacation this year 
where you can spend at least a few hours alone, 
outdoors, cut off from human contact if possible, 
and take an honest, gut-wrenching look at your 
life before God. From His point of view, what 
have you become? Do not fear the truth, for it 
will set you free. At least, if you are humble 
and admit to God that you need help. It is at 
exactly that point that help miraculously 
appears. It may be instantaneous, or simply 
start there and grow.</P>


<P>Right now my mind is on a mountain retreat, but 
you could also go for a sunrise walk by a wheat 
field on the prairies, and have such an experience.</P>

<P>
Unless you are able to vacation alone, consider a 
package where your family members can have their 
own adventures, or luxuriate in a mineral hot 
springs.</P>


<P>Just this year I've made new friends and learned 
of their wilderness vacation packages, where both 
you and your other-extreme family members can all 
be made happy. It has just opened, so I know there 
may be room for short-notice bookings. It's  a 
five-day wilderness vacation at Meadow Creek in 
the Canadian Rockies, just a bit north of the 
American border.</P>


<P>Their guests are kept in a fine hotel on the 
shore of Kootenay Lake. There is a hot springs 
nearby, with caves to explore. Meadow Creek 
Wilderness Vacations arranges to pick up your 
party each day and take you to see the sights, 
all over the mountains in 4x4 all-terrain-
vehicles, and bring you back at the end of each 
day to the hotel with the pool and all its fine 
facilities.</P>


<P>Your package can be tailored, so you might ask 
them to drop you off with a blanket and a picnic 
at some lovely view spot, and let the rest of 
your party go boating, water-skiing, or exploring 
Sandon, a ghost town, and an abandoned silver 
mine nearby, while you sort out the questions, 
priorities, and projects of your life.</P>


<P>If you have been living at 300 mph, you may need 
to just lie back and unwind first. You'll get 
sleepy if not used to sitting still, so have a 
nap. It may take until the second or third day, 
when you have spelled out all that is on your 
mind, that the answers begin to come.</P>


<P>Even so, for a thorough spiritual retreat you 
must involve God and yield to His greater 
purposes. It is after all His universe, and all 
its principles, whether mechanical or spiritual, 
have a beautiful synergy. To get in sync at that 
level is where you will find true fulfillment 
and wholeness.</P>
