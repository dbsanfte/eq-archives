	<P>It is morning. The surf crashes onto the beach, sucks at the pebbles and rolls back.</P>

<P>She watches him walk up the sandy path from their cottage to the railway station, past the neat row of houses and the Eventide Retirement Home with the wind-tattered apple tree in the garden. The commuter train draws into the station. It engulfs him and glides off  into the gloomy morning.
</P>
<P>She smiles.</P>

<P>Alone at last. Nothing to do now but stare at the sea and care for the life quickening in her womb. It turns and kicks. Why so anxious to come into this world? You wouldn't want to stay with me for long child. Look you are born with the sound of the sea in your ears, bound to be a sailor, bound to travel away.
</P>
<P>She looks up at the tree? It blossoms. The fruit ripens. Like the fruit we fall. We eat and are lead to this, trapped in matrimony by a stranger who escapes daily to the sordid turmoil of the city. He doesn't have to sit here all day, trapped between earth and water.
</P>
<P>Turn on the radio. Music and talk. Background to nothing. The breakfast dishes are sitting there waiting to be done.
</P>
<P>The phone rings</P>

<P>-You forgot to put in my lunch.</P>

<P>So she did. There it is, sitting on the top of the fridge.</P>

<P>-I'm sorry, you'll just have to buy some.</P>

<P>She puts down the phone and turns to the dishes. From the window above the sink she looks idly at the surf crushing the shore.  There is something out there amidst the sea-mist, amidst the  tossing waves. A small fishing boat. Who would want to travel out there on a day such as this? But of course sailors have to tend  the sea in all weathers.
</P>
<P>As she looks she becomes aware that something appears to be wrong, the vessel is rolling with a seasick motion, without control,  rolling towards the shore.
</P>
<P>She rushes from the cottage, onto the stony beach,  still in her dressing gown. The boat is just outside the range  of the breakers but steadily moving closer. What to do?  Should she ring the police? Would they get here in time?  Suddenly there is a mutter, a muted heartbeat of engines  above the sound of the surf. The boat begins to move of its own volition away from the dangerous shore. She waves.  There is a dark bearded man at the wheel. He waves back.
</P>
<P>-You have brought me luck, he seems to say. You have  saved me from the perilous marge, the crushing rocks,  a weed-entwined sea-wash death.
</P>
<P>She could see the drowned eyes of sailors, rotten and  pecked at by fishes, and bones bleached white by the water.  Had she saved him from that doom? Merely by her presence  on the shore? It seemed hardly possible. A passing fancy.
</P>
<P>The dishes have to be done slowly, to fill out the day.  Perhaps she should read a book but there was nothing of  interest in the house, absolutely nothing.
</P>
<P>She should have married a sailor, like that one out there. Someone free. He probably wouldn't want to be tied down by a woman. He might be a rough man. She wouldn't mind that as long as she wasn't kept trapped in a cage. Who are those jailers that live in the city? They are like robots. Machines. A steady thrum of dynamos producing power. Power to corrupt the world and then one day, she knew it would happen, not too far distant, the corruption would fester and suddenly catch fire. The nuclear bombs would fall and the cities would become ashes and the worms that lived there would be consumed in that cleansing fire.
</P>
<P>And him with it, a charcoal skeleton, glowing with radiation for centuries.</P>

<P>Then that sailor would come, for her and the child. He would sail bravely through the crashing surf. They would take a cutting from the apple tree, not yet fully blighted by the malignant rays, and travel across the ocean to an island free from tarnish. They would live on fish and apples, untroubled, until the end of their days.
</P>
<P>The mail arrives. She struggles into her clothes and goes out to the letter-box. One for him and one for her. An invitation to go to the United States Embassy to hear a Pulitzer Prize  winner read his poetry. They bring their poets to New Zealand on a junket for cultural relations. That embassy building was a concrete pillbox built on the site of the dear old house where Katherine Mansfield had once lived. What effrontery to read poetry there. How could she possibly go? Those bland city buildings, they stalk across our vision blocking out simple humanity.
</P>
<P>Lunch is over and there is nothing to do. Perhaps she should write. A story for radio. What a waste of time. She wrote one once but nobody bothered to listen to it. Soon there will be nappies and sleepless nights, while that stranger goes off. That stranger? The one she shared the apple with, the one that caused her to waste her life on children, cooking, matrimony.
</P>
What if he would come, that dark sailor with his salt-burnt hands, rough from the real world, full of wind and spray, a gust of life? Shell-grit hard he would hold her, that sailor, find a small cavern in his heart for her. Warmth in the dark.
<BR>
<P>Fruitless dreams all of them. Pointless.</P>

<P>Dear old Jean from the Eventide Home is walking along the beach watching the surf. She wraps her croqueted shawl around her shoulders and picks up useless pieces of driftwood, shells cast off by the sea. The sum total of her life. Driftwood. Shells that the sea creatures no longer need. Come in Jean, for a cup of tea and cake. Tell me your stories.
</P>
<P>-The children never come and see me now. Too caught up in their own affairs. Since my husband passed on ...
</P>
<P>The old girl pauses and sips at her cup of tea. The cup trembles - the quiver of old age. Why do we look at things like that with disgust. It can't be helped. The body is frail, it's a piece of driftwood cast away by life.
</P>
<P>-We used to go to dances. They were such gay times.</P>

<P>Of course you can't use the word 'gay' in that context now.</P>

<P>-The people of today, they don't have any sense of what is right and proper. There never was the violence, even in the depression. It's all posture and pout. Help yourself and not a thought for thy neighbour.
</P>
<P>She cuts another piece of cake and nibbles at the corner.</P>

<P>-Did you ever go to those old dances? Grace and elegance wasn't it?</P>

<P>There is a new force in the world. It sucks us dry and asks for vague titillations.</P>

<P>The old thing goes at last, up the hill and past the apple tree.</P>

<P>He should be home soon, an alien in this wild dusk.</P>

<P>I gave him an apple when the fruit was ripe. We both wanted to taste that sweet juice. The apple was ready, summer ripe, autumn ripe, and I gave it to him and he took it and sucked it with his lips, bit into it, crunched it with his teeth. The taste of apple juice. Nectar, nectar in the night.
</P>
<P>Now the sea sucks at pebbles on the beach.</P>

<P>And I have you within, little one.</P>

<P>He comes in and places his briefcase by the leg of the table.</P>

<P>-Did you have a good day?</P>

<P>-It was nothing, nothing out of the ordinary. A perfectly normal day.</P>
