<P align=justify>
	The rain had begun to fall.  A slight drizzle was taken over by the more powerful drops.  He usually enjoyed such weather but was lost in his own thoughts and didn't even notice.  Sitting by the front window, Paul felt a coldness that he couldn't explain.  The evening was warm enough despite the weather.  His chill came from within.
<P align=justify>
	It had been two years since she left.  He managed to survive Christmas and New Years with out her.  Valentines Day was a little rough but got through it though.  He didn't know why this sense of emptiness had taken him.  The holidays didn't mean that much any more.  
<P align=justify>
	He began to wonder if he was really over her.  Of course he was he would tell himself time and time again.  Did he need some one?  It was a loaded question and he knew it.  Need wasn't the word for it, wanted was a better one, yet desperately craving fit better than any other did.  Yes, he desperately craved for companionship. Loneliness was an emotion he began to grow accustomed to.  

<P align=justify>	A bright bolt of lightning flashed across the sky pulling him back into reality.  Even the rain couldn't lift his spirits as it had done so many times before.  He moved away from the window and sat on the couch.  Turning on the t.v. was a futile attempt at occupying his mind but did it anyway.  The mindless drivel fell on deaf ears as Paul slipped back into his trance.  
<P align=justify>
	He needed a drink.  It had been decided that he was going to drink himself into a stupor and pass out.  Drinking had become more and more a part of his daily routine.  This frightened him.  He didn't like the fact that he was slowly becoming an alcoholic yet did nothing to prevent it.  
<P align=justify>
	Rising to his feet, The young man slowly walked to the adjoining kitchenette and poured a stiff gin and tonic.  Well gin with a splash of tonic would've been a better description.  By the time he had made it back to the couch his drink had been finished.  He noticed this and decided that the best thing to do was to bring the bottle with him.  
<P align=justify>
	The alcohol had begun to take effect on his body and a small smile finally crept across his face.  His feelings of emptiness had lifted and he was finally feeling better.  Losing himself in the television combined with the gin had completed his plan and was out cold within minutes.
<P align=justify>
	The phone ringing had woken him from his slumber and he cursed himself for forgetting to turn off the ringer.  Sitting upright on the couch, Paul gathered himself and went to the phone just in time for it to stop ringing.  Not a good way to start the day he thought.  Being rather perturbed by this he picked up the phone and said, "Well fuck you too!" to an innocent dial tone.
<P align=justify>
	Being so close to the kitchen he poured himself a tall glass of water.  In an instant it was gone.  The water had fought bravely against the cotton mouth Paul was experiencing and won.  After a much needed hot shower he dressed.  He was ready for the world today and felt incredibly well despite the mood he had been in the night before.  It was now time to move on.
