<U><B>Chapter 4 Into the Dream city (cont.) </B></U></center>

<BR><P align=justify>


	"Man, I had another f'd up dream last night, I'll tell you guys about it later, once we get rolling 

again.  Speaking of which uh when do you guys want to take off?"
<P align=justify>
	Insano responds alertly as if he's got it all mapped out.  "Yeah ,um we should probably get our 

stuff together and stealth on out of here as soon as possible.  I'd like to do some morning hiking somewhere 

since we're near the Alleghinis, and uh after that I think we should probably try to make it as close to 

Lowell as possible, what do ya think?" 
<P align=justify>
	"Yeah, let's cruise."
<P align=justify>
So they pack up shop, man their battle-stations, and stealth on out of there.  While rolling out of cove 

across the grouchy gravel  the camp grounds wear a different look in the light of dawn.  Onward through 

the King-Kong gates, no merchants…coast clear…goodbye Deer-Cove fading softly into the blur of rear-

view light, gone.  Back to the road, Alleghini, roller-coaster road of stomach-dropping whipee!  Pop in 

tape, … 'how about some Bowie' - All the young dudes, carry the news, all the young dudes, and Ziggy-

Stardust live, wonderful soundtrack for the drive.  Insano cranks up the volume, time to decline, kick-back, 

relax, and let that bubbly-breeze blow against face like a dog, and surf that wave onward, up down, down 

and out, twisting, and turning, flying down across country back-roads like maniacs.  All the while 

concocting limerick's, demented diddy's, and hurendous hypothetical scenario's, mad as hell.  After 

driving for awhile Donny shares his feelings about the direction of the day.
<P align=justify>
	"I kinda have a feeling that something's gonna show us the way, so uh like everyone keep an eye 

out for any mysterious clues, or signs for direction.  But then again on the other hand its like, we've still 

gotta be careful because how do we know that the signs aren't traps set by Mr. You know who, trying to 

lure us into his domain…so uh I guess we just gotta play it safe!"
<P align=justify>
	"Yeah that bastards slippery alright, he's liable dispatch a tribe of vile, blood-lusting, wild-

turkey's after us." Adds Insano.  
<P align=justify>
 	T-bone adds his take to the conversation - "Crackle ta-ha, What are ya guys, nuts?  Shut the f'n 

door!  The Beast doesn't need to trap us, he knows exactly what's gonna happen, just take a look out the 

window in the woods…See him, look at him just tearing ass through the forest thinking we don't know he's 

hang'n with us, his satchel bouncing all around smacking against his ass while running so fast to keep 

up!"
<P align=justify>
	"Whoa!  I don't even want to look man, that's way to disturbing of an image."
<P align=justify>
	"why don't we uh head down this road, looks like there's some pretty hike-able terrain."
<P align=justify>
Down the hill, outside window so many great-little back-road shops flashing on by.  'Not enough time, 

wish we could stop at all of them.'  Merchant after merchant, porch after porch cluttered full of old dusty 

antiques, Dutch memorabilia, and Big-ol girthy Indians watching guard of all the goods.  'Oh so many 

merchants, may they all find their field of dreams so the consumer can come!'  The drifters find an enticing 

batch of paths near a river, they pull off the road and into the lot overlooking the brown stream.  It begins to 

drizzle as they set out for the hike.  Across from the river lies a giant of a mountain all full of green pines 

and hiking paths, a cobblestone bridge connects to the other side.  Across the creek to the moist paths they 

go, the sky darkening to gray haze drizzle mist.  Donny removes his faithful blue-hooded sweatshirt he's 

glad he brought along and ties it around waist.  He's beginning to feel a bit gritty thanks to the rain and all. 

They embark upon a path entitled 'Baker's trail'.  Back on the other side of the stream, a ways down 

past the dove sits a pavilion full of senior-citizens who appear to be gathered before a speaker.
<P align=justify>
	"Should we crash the party?"  asks T-bone.  Of course they don't, but it's the thought that counts.
<P align=justify>
	"We're now entering an enchanted forest full of Warlock nomes." Begins the Captain/demented 

tour-guide for the moment.  "These little bastards do not like humans, seeing that they party with the beast 

and participate in his orgies."  
<P align=justify>
	"Dude, I didn't know nomes were that deviant" comments Don.
<P align=justify>
	"Yeah, well these ones are!"
<P align=justify>
	"maybe we should head back."  Eyes meet… "Naw, F the Beast! Onward!"  And they begin 

hauling ass on up the hill, bouncing limb to limb, vines snapping, sharp-prickers batted away with walking 

stick until out of breath, hands on knees, heart a thumping with rain ba-boom ba-boom.  With the energy 

subsiding they take a seat near a huge wooden sign atop the hill.  Turns out the hill has withstood a whole 

hell of a lot more energy than what they had just conjured up over all these years.  Don reads the sign -

which  sort of reminds him of some dream: 
<BR>
CATHEDRAL AREA WINDTHROW
<BR>
	                                   7:00 p.m.  August 18, 1956
<P align=justify>
     A storm of cyclonic intensity like a beast, devastated these four acres which were once covered with 

     virgin white pine and Hemlock, some as large as 46 in. in diameter and 200 ft high.  To protect the                   

     remaining trees from insect and disease damage most of the windthrown material was removed.  Some 

     of the splintered and broken trees have been allowed to remain as silent reminders of the destructive         

     powers of nature.  

<P align=justify>
After resting for awhile its time to move on, and back down the hill.  Don finds a nice walking 

stick, holds tape-recorder to the wind and sings songs of nonsense.  With the songs coming to an end the 

wanderers approach another bridge.  Don signals to his companions 'Achtung something is happening here'  

On goes tape-recorder, and Donny begins with Monty-Pythonian pragmatism:
<P align=justify>
	"We find ourselves at a bridge, but on that bridge is a man wearing a bright red -'Beaver club' hat 

(t-bone), he says we shall not pass."  As Don narrates the scenario the others act out the parts.  T-bone 

stoically garding bridge with extra-long stick obstructing the rite of passage.  Insano runs back up the trail 

to gain momentum, then racing down full-speed ahead towards the others.
<P align=justify>
	"I SHALL PASS!"
<P align=justify>
	"Hault!  What Knighthood do you represent brotheran?"
<P align=justify>
	"Uh…I represent the Theta-Omega!"  He responds with beer-boasting pretension.  
<P align=justify>
	"What is your name brotheran?"
<P align=justify>
	"I am sir brother Drinks A lot!  Now let me through!"
<P align=justify>
	"Well in that case you may certainly pass, but where's the beer and the bitches?!"
<P align=justify>
Upon conclusion of the drama a nearby audience of befuddled senior-citizens stare down upon the actors 

in anxious anticipation - 'what next?  Are we safe?  Maybe we should go back the other way.'  And so the 

thespians react in the only way they know how - They take of running like mad, down the slope of the hill, 

off the path, hooting and a howling beast yodels, and on through the river, slish slosh swish, into the wide-

open field a sprinting and a combating each other with walking sticks.
<P align=justify>
	"I will eat your heart tonight!"
<P align=justify>
	"Well not if I consume your spleen first! On guard fool!"
<P align=justify>

When the sword-fight ends a few rays of sunlight squeeze through the trees, and the heroes head on back to 

the dove.  
<P align=justify>

"Insano fire up that engine"…off again! - and on past Navin Johnson gas stations, thrift-shops, 

beverage-garages, offices dull in the gray light of misty-morning, everyone else on their daily way, away 

from black truth, away into the comfort of rhoutine.  As they near the high-way they approach a Canoeing 

establishment - Cook Forest Canoe Livery!  
<P align=justify>
	"Whoa, Canoeing!!" declares the Captain with demon excitement as he suddenly pulls into the 

naked parking lot.  The three hobo's hop on out of the car, and decide that its time for some P.B. 

sandwiches.   After eating they head on over to the office window - actually a wooden cubicle wearing a 

smell of kerosene.  Inside the cubicle sits a young merchant - age 16 or so, Pennsylvania scruff, bushy hair, 

sweat-pants, and bright-yellow striped tube-socks.  When Donny inquires

"Uh what's the score here?"
<P align=justify>
The merchant does his best to wheel and deal.  So they end-up paying the merchant for the over-priced trip-

ticket and endure the ridicule of the wily money-grubbers anyway.
<P align=justify>
	"All three of ya in one canu - HA HAGH HAGHH. Don't know if I'd call that canu'en, more like 

drag'n I'd say."  But they saddle up regardless and set off down the empty waters of the Clarion River.  
<P align=justify>
	Once floating downstream Don pulls out a great tacky little Indian Love signs booklet he 

purchased from Marc's back home.  He thinks of his great-grandfather a black-foot Indian, and laments the 

state of Indian dreams relegated to the confines of such places as pop-culture has designated them - like 

behind the registers of Marc's or grocery stores.  As the river's gentle current is met with more misty rain 

Don reads aloud to the others their Indian horoscopes.  When he reaches his concurrent section something 

strange happens.  While reading its shivers as the precarious strangeness begins to fall into place.
<P align=justify>
	"whoa…I guess I'm the raven, here's what it says…
<P align=justify>
	Raven has long history in mythology, folklore and legend.  In the bible, the raven was forbidden as 

food since it's a scavenger and, therefore considered unclean.
<P align=justify>
	In the Middle ages, the croak of a raven was thought to fortell death or the outcome of a battle.  It 

was believed that unclean priests turned into ravens when they died.
<P align=justify>
	Ravens are natural talkers and have been known to imitate human speech (or perhaps writing).
<P align=justify>
	Through dreams, they convey messages from the spirit world!!
<P align=justify>
Donny now mystified as all hell breaking loose, ghosts breaking loose, fury shall find a way.  Mystified 

by the all too relevant coincidence of his ongoing saga, he thinks of his beloved bag of writings,  feeling 

now as if they're just forming from thin air, magic, somehow finding form through the dreamer and his 

madcap illusions!  
<P align=justify>
	"Whoa, That's it, That's it!! The dreams, this river, Sal's Paradise, a portal, it must be a portal, 

portifice gentlemen - Dream onward out-loud I say, and keep going…Gone, that's the way I like it, it's 

better that way, Gone is where I long to be…I don't ever want to come back down!"
<P align=justify>
The plicking of drizzles continue with each gentle stir of oar.  A blue heron swoops down from the 

trees cutting across in front of canoe landing swiftly upon the pebble-coast on the edge of the river-bank.  

(The bird yet another reminder of her - reminding him of the first time he saw one of those magnificent 

beasts down in the Florida Keys, oh the keys, the keys disease, and her wonderful family, watching the 

nuclear sun dip beneath the placid waves, those beautiful sunsets, ah the keys…get it together Donny 

there's a story to be told here).  
<P align=justify>
The river spills into an area surrounded by sloped hills full of trees, the feeling of sweet seclusion 

and meditative silence, a feeling of Grand-Canyon hawk-moon, coyote and road-runner marathon of noth'n 

left to do but turn off your mind relax and float down stream.   Suddenly dream-ja-vu - the sloped river bed 

of seclusion, - dream-recall - the hill, running wildly through that hill…but with Black-Bears…running to 

join a fleet of canoes.    
<P align=justify>
	"Seems like I've been her before, seems so familiar, seems like I'm slipping into a dream within a 

dream, ('come on Don don't be such a tool!)  I've been here before, I've dreamed of this hill, except there 

were black-bears on it!  Man its seriously f'd up how these places I've never been before provoke dream 

recall, what the hell does that mean?!"  And so Don experiences the first of what would become several 

realizations of dream-ja-vus along the journey, each one thereafter becoming more strange, vivid, 

yet somehow meaningful. 
<P align=justify>
	As Donny's paranoia falls upon spaced-out ears the merchant's prophecy becomes a reality -   

Cabam…Screechh…and then it's the canoe dragging, and T-bone standing to fix it, and…"NOOOO!"- 

CaSplash they go under, the canoe tips over, Donny nearly cracking his skull against a rock.  They 

resurface immediately and tip the vessel back right side up, all the while spitting out musky river.  T-bone 

now looking quite hilarious with shades still on and his cherry-red sweat-pants all soaking wet.  The 

Captain nearly looses his specks as they go floating downstream with his sketch-book.  They gather the 

goods and head on back into canoe, down river, riding on peacefully for several moments of oar soothing 

serenity until - The canoe drills another rock, is turned around by indifferent current, and begins floating 

down stream backwards and BOOM - another rock!  Don reaches out to push off…'almost got it, almost, 

alright, Oh no, Oh shit!  Timber' - and its seaworthy again, men overboard.
