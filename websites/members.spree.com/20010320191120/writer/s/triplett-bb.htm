caution.</P></FONT>
<P>Being the "baby" of the family has its advantages, although its share of
disadvantages as well. For me, the process of growing up was relatively
easy; I never did much that got me into trouble, I went to church with
my parents, (even through my brothers were not made to go,) and I
behaved at school.
</P>
<P> The youngest of five kids, I did not really know my sister very well
because of our age difference of 10 or 11 years, depending upon whose
birthday it was last. But I do have a memory of getting up in the middle
of the night and sitting on her boyfriend's lap when I was about six
years old. I still have the Navy hat he gave me back then, although I
had to bleach it because my brother, Richard, took fluorescent paint and
wrote "SEX" all over it... Richard is the closest to me in age, being four
years older.</P>

 <P>Then there is Eddie, who would not allow my brother Richard to pick on
me or yell at me. Eddie took me to Disneyland for the first time in my
life, even though it was his first time too and he was taking his
girlfriend. There's no easy way to describe Eddie, but I guess it would
be accurate to say that he is truly a "live and let live" kind of guy.
</P>
<P> The oldest boy in my family is Bobbie, or Bob, or even Robert, which is
his real name and the one he used when he joined the Army. A few
years ago, I was on the phone with Bobby talking about the problems
occurring in the Middle East. Operation Desertshield, it was being called
at the moment, not yet having escalated to Operation Desertstorm.
</P>
 <P>"I sure hope this does not become another Vietnam," were the words I
spoke to my brother.</P>

<P> Bob simply stated "There will never be another Vietnam."</P>

<P> I hope Bob knows. He does know, without a doubt, about Vietnam. At
the fresh boyhood age of eighteen, Bob joined his troop, and climbed
upon the military airplane that shook and rumbled the boys halfway
around the world, to serve their country.
</P>
 <P>Our country. I remember, at my own young thirteen years of life, asking
my seventh grade teacher where in the heck this place called Vietnam
was, and what did it mean that my brother was going there? I was not
prepared for her response. Nineteen sixty-eight was not the best of
times to enter Hanoi, nor was it the worst of times.
</P>
<P> Somewhat like the classic "Tale of Two Cities" it was the best for many,
and it quickly became the worst for others. My own brother's tale, while
not good, at least returned him to his home and family in the end. His
is a story of a country not easily forgotten by some, and never forgotten
by boys like Bob. The tales of cities like Ho Chi Ming, Hanoi, and Saigon.
I often wonder just how many men have this story engraved upon their
minds.</P>

<P> So, between playing with Barbie dolls and dress-up, and seeing that
maybe boys aren't so bad after all, I watched my mother track the
locations that Bob wrote he was sent next.</P>

<P> Often his letters were long past the actual move he made, and I was
fascinated with the red mud on the envelopes, although mom would not
let me read the letters. His troop's job was to be dropped off in the
middle of territories suspected to have Viet Cong, locate them and
report their locations.</P>

<P> While I did not realize what it meant until many years later, I knew that
his troop was called the Charlie Company, or the Big Red One. On the
wall-map back home, stick-pins marked locations of the enemy, with red
circles indicating how close they came to Bob's troop. As my mother
circled these foreign names of cities, I watched the concern rise within
her. I could clearly see the pain in her eyes while she read his letters,
and I remember her fear vividly. It was many, many years before she let
me read those letters. It seemed to me that I was never going to be
allowed to wear make-up and Bobby was gone a very long time.</P>

<P> Those that served in Vietnam somehow hold their companionship
gregariously. It seems that most never talk about it, but some feel they
must speak out. Rarely did a man who came home have the opportunity
to speak with counselors or doctors of their private sufferings and
nightmares. History tells us that Americans left this "undeclared war" in
1974. They left behind them over 25 years of struggle, 45,000 dead
soldiers, and over 10,000 missing in action and prisoners of war.</P>

 <P>Washington, DC., emblazoned upon a large wall the names of 57,939
men and women. These names represent someone's father, brother,
husband, sister, wife, son, or daughter. The fascination of the American
people of the Vietnam conflict has been portrayed in hundreds of movies
and television shows. If one chooses to watch Apocalypse Now, The
Hunter, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, or on a slightly lighter side, Good
Morning, Vietnam, you can see that each film shows a unique version of
individual pain, with the intent of helping those of us that do not really
understand, could not really know; teaching us in a more gentle manner
what our soldiers went through. To get a true impact of these movies,
one needs only attend with a Vietnam Vet. It'll scare you to death!
</P>
 <P>While movies may have depicted occasional fun and games for the guys
serving "our country," allowing those of us who did not live through it
the perception of a lighter side for the boys, there was no lighter side of
life for many of our troops. There was, in fact, no light at all in the
middle of the night, crouching in the jungle, hiding in a wet rice patty,
or trying to look out from the top of a hill when there was nothing to be
seen but something was out there... No light for fear that it would
betray their positions to the Viet Cong. No, movies can neither depict
nor truly scratch the surface of what happened over there. We cannot
feel what our men surely must truly have felt. We can't imagine the
battles they encountered, the fear, the pain of watching fellow soldiers
hurt or mangled, pushing aside the dead, the destruction of the country
and it's people, nor of the defeat...
</P>
 <P>Vietnam has been over for more than 25 years now, at least to the eyes
of the majority. But is it over for those who have come home? For
families that will never see their loved ones again?
</P>
 <P>It's not over for Bob, my brother, who sits in front of his tray of over 56
medications he takes 3 times a day. He takes several to keep his body
from rejecting his second kidney transplant, and others to lower the
blood pressure which is high due to the anti-rejection medications. He
takes the pain pills for the chronic ache of pain residing in his body. He
takes yet more for the stomach ache all of the other pills give him. And
more for the constipation, then for the anxiety this has all caused. My
sister, Sharon, the only match for Bob's first kidney transplant, waits for
results of tests from her own doctor as to the now failing health of her
remaining single kidney.</P>

 <P>Bob, like many others, was exposed to Agent Orange, a chemical
herbicide used to eliminate brush in the jungle so the Viet Cong could
not easily hide. Now known to cause cancer, liver and kidney failure, and
nerve disorders, it is rare that the U.S. Government admits the ailments
the veterans are suffering from was caused by this herbicide. And if they
do, the veteran is lucky just to have his medications paid for, for the
rest of his life. The irony is that the General who ordered Agent Orange
spread died of cancer, as did his son, and his grandson has leukemia.
You see, it remains in the bloodstream.</P>

 <P>700,000 vets came home from Vietnam suffering from various forms of
"post traumatic stress disorder", called "shell shock" after WW II, and
"Battle fatigue" from WW I. Vietnam caused more cases than either of
the previous conflicts, including the Korean War. Its symptoms, which
can occur from ten to fifteen years later, range from panic and rage, to
anxiety, depression, and emotional paralysis. Bob lined his bedroom
windows with aluminum foil to keep the light out so he could sleep. But
there was nothing he could do about the noises.</P>

 <P>I remember being in a room with him when someone threw a coke bottle
into a large trash can; it made a loud sound, and I saw Bob dive for the
floor in less than a split second - he said he thought it was a mortar
round - ten years after he had come home.</P>

 <P>I have often questioned what it was that caused this 'war" to be so
much more distinctive from other wars, why were these soldiers
seemingly affected more than their fathers who went to war before
them? In Vietnam, a soldier could be assigned to an office job in
Saigon, a seemingly safe task. He could then be killed any moment by
communist rockets. An infantryman climbing through the bush was in
combat continually, harassed by mines, traps, snipers, or in direct
combat. There was no logic in the Viet Cong's movements. No location
was safe.</P>

<P> The United States Marine Unit had been celebrated for their exploits
against the Japanese in the Pacific Campaign. They fought NO LONGER
than six to eight weeks during ALL of World War II. The average
Vietnam tour of duty was 13 months.</P>

<P> The average age of the American soldier in Vietnam was 19 years, 7
years younger than his father who fought in WW II. This young 19 year
old was far more vulnerable to strains of this bloody struggle. Any
Vietnamese running from an American was suspect, and the American
soldier was ordered to shoot; even if it was an elderly, terrified woman
running through a rice field. Young and pretty, some Vietnamese
women, might at one moment be smiling and flirting, and in a flash
slitting throats with knives pulled from their dresses. Children were sent
into groups of American Soldiers, with instructions on how to pull the
pin from the grenade they carried. Safety was nowhere to be found. In
other wars, the enemy could be recognized, but not in Vietnam.</P>

<P> And when our soldiers came home? There was no holiday or parade. No
fanfare. No, it was more like a deep feeling of possible contamination
with what they may have brought back with them. The United States
government should be more than ashamed.</P>

<P> Even after Bob came home, I kept copies of each letter mom got from
him, made after she finally let me read them.</P>

<P> From a 19 year old man came these words:</P>

 <P>"Mom, I got your letter and your card and appreciate them both very
much. I got a letter from grandma today too.</P>

<P>Well, mom, as far as what I do out here is more of less depending upon
Viet Cong activity in the area. They brought us here just so the V C.
would try and hit us. We were hit 2 nights ago by about 400 VC.</P>

<P> We were told about 7:30 that evening that we would be kept up again all
night. You see, we thought that we were going to be hit. We had only
one man killed. This was because he had fallen asleep again.</P>

<P> As soon as we heard to expect an attack everything started moving in a
frenzy. Our bunker will hold off a mortar round without any trouble so we
(myself and 3 others) loaded all the ammo we could find. I had never
shot a M-60 gun before so one of the guys gave me a lesson.</P>
<P>
 I was on a 60 machine gun, the other California guy was on a 50 gun,
and the other two were throwing grenades. We were told we had a
certain area of fire to cover. There are only about 120 men where I am
at. It was a good thing we were dug in pretty good.</P>

 <P>At about 2 am in the morning, mortar rounds and rockets started
droppin' in on us. They got one tank with a rocket. When they stopped,
we knew that they would be coming in.</P>

<P> This place is surrounded by mines and 5 strands of consternation wire.
Somehow about 70 V C. made it through a hole in the wire, when the
other gunman and I opened up with all we possibly could. Believe me, I
was scared.</P>
<P>
 The VC. started running after about 30 minutes of fighting. When daylight
had arrived we counted 191 dead Viet Cong The other guy and myself
had caught 61 coming through the hole in the wire and hit them in a
crossfire.</P>

<P>I don 't know whether this sounds like I am braggin, but myself and the
other guy from California, were awarded the Bronze Star and a V for
Valor. Mom, you know how my eyesight is. I'm sure glad it was dark I
did better than in daylight.</P>

<P>I have to get busy for awhile so I'd better go now. I'll write as soon as
possible. I know Kathy wants me to write her more than once a week,
but I don 't want her to know why I haven't.</P>

<P>I'm not trying to scare anyone but we've been getting mortared in the
middle of the day.</P>
<P>
 Tell Eddie and Richard to stay out of here as long as possible.</P>

 <P>Bob."</P>

 <P>Richard, my youngest brother, went just over three years later in 1971.
He did not "have" to go, because his brother had been. He wanted to go
because his brother had been. This decision was a mistake, and he's
never been the same.</P>

 <P>When he rescued the American Soldier the V.C. were holding out the
window of a building by grabbing him and pulling him back up, he
destroyed his backbone by separating the vertebrae up the entire spine
and neck, and has since had several surgeries to fuse the backbone and
neck vertebrae together into a single solid piece.</P>

 <P>Henry Kissinger once made the statement: "Vietnam is still with us. It
has created doubt about American judgment, about American credibility,
about American power. Not only at home but throughout the world, it has
poisoned our domestic debate. So we paid an exorbitant price for the
decisions that were made in good faith and for good purpose."</P>

<P> I've yet to look at Sacramento's Vietnam monument and walk away
without sobbing. My brothers cannot bear to read the names, yet find
the wall irresistible. They look for their companions' names upon the
wall, and grow silent when they find these long gone friends. Last year,
Bob was visiting and somehow my mother sneakily managed to
maneuver us over the Capital, and I ended up pushing Bob in his
wheelchair through the Vietnam Memorial.</P>

<P> It took every bit of strength and energy to not completely lose my
composure as I pushed him around, and eventually, I had to get away,
and my mom took over. But there is some sort of healing in Bob's need
to be reminded by viewing this monument to the Vietnam vets.</P>



<P>I see that monuments are not enough, and never will be. The Vietnam
vets seemed to be seeking respect and justice, the debt that no doubt,
nations truly owe their warriors.</P>

<P> I was 13 when my oldest brother went to Vietnam. I was 15 when my
youngest brother went to Vietnam. And I consider our family lucky,
despite Bob's failed kidneys, and Richard's deteriorating bone mass in
the spine, and the nerve damage in his legs.</P>

 <P>Despite the fact that traces of Agent Orange have been found in the
bloodstream's of both my brothers, they have never received any
assistance, financially or emotionally, from the government.</P>

<P> I watched my parents grow sad over the years at the poor health of
their children. But, we are at least grateful, that they did come home to
us.</P>

 <P>I think now and then of the men and women who were involved in the
Desertshield/Desertstorm Operation. Most of these kids probably were
raised by parents who stood solely against war, against guns, and
against violence.</P>

 <P>I try to feel the strength in my heart to feel that we, the Americans,
continue to do what's right. And I wonder how many will suffer and for
how long.</P>

<P> The V for Valor, the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, the Big Red One
stitched to the shoulder of my brother's uniform, these did little for my
brothers. They both use wheelchairs. Bob keeps a gun, and his wife
hides it from him on his bad days</P>.

<P> Richard lost his son and wife to pain pills and street drugs.</P>

 <P>Eddie, the middle brother, never went into the service, but is serving his
own brand of punishment, 21 years in a Federal Prison, for personal
possession of $240.00 worth of Meth.</P>
<P>
 Bob says there will never be another Vietnam.</P>

<P> I hope he's right. . .</P>

         <P> A tribute to my brothers, who served America in the only

      way they knew how - in ignorance.</P>
