Joe sat with his brother, Irving, in a two-walled tree-house (two walls blocking the north wind and two open to give them a clear shot of any deer crossing the path) and talked about his wife.  There were many things he could say about her, but he chose to illuminate her shortcomings, something he'd done for twenty years.<P align=justify>
"I don't know what happened.  Can't get 'er outta bed most days.  One minute she wants to go to fancy restaurants we can't afford and the next she's flat on her back cursing that damned diamond ring."
Irving, who was never much of a talker, listened.  Because everything came so much easier to Irving--money, especially--he figured he owed it to Joe to listen.  He ate his four-tier salmon and cream cheese sandwich in silence, jutting his elbow and putting a finger to his lips when he thought a deer might be nearby.<P align=justify>
 "We all have dreams, but she's gotta realize that dreams don't pay the bills. Remember how I always said if I got rich I'd buy myself a '69 Dodge Super Bee Six Pack?" Joe asked.<P align=justify>
Irving nodded and twisted open his thermos.  Poured some warm coffee, beige, a bit of half-and-half already mixed in.<P align=justify>
"So what's the big deal? She went to Sobeys, filled out a ballot and stuffed it in a box.  Two days later, a phone call.  Honey's won the damned diamond ring," Joe said.<P align=justify>
Irving shifted his weight, unfolded his legs and dangled them over the side.<P align=justify>
"Don't move yer feet like that.  Somebody'll think you're a deer and shoot yer legs off," Joe warned.<P align=justify>
Irving pulled his feet back into the tree house.  Every deer season, the men took a week off from work to hunt together (easier for Irving, a customer service auditor, then for Joe, a mechanic).  The men enjoyed the sport and each had their specific preferences.  Irving succeeded most at rabbit hunting, using snares to catch his prey.   Joe preferred to stalk his prey with gun and, when necessary, hound. <P align=justify>
"Remember when I met Honey?" Joe asked.  Irving did.  He'd just turned eighteen, Joe seventeen.  Irving recalled falling in love with her himself, partly because of her quiet way, but mostly because of her big dreams.  She was delicate, "small-boned" she'd called herself, and when she got really close she had the kind of moist, sweet breath that didn't make you want to turn your head away.  Irving had thought it strange that Joe called her "Honey", until he realized that her name was actually just that. <P align=justify>
  	"She was so quiet.  I always teased her 'cause no one ever knew what the hell she was saying.  I knew we'd make a good pair.  I never had money so I figured there'd be no pressure.  You'd think a woman like that wouldn't want for much. You know?"<P align=justify>
Irving pulled the heated pillow out from under himself  and gave it a shake.  Wasn't working like it should and his body was going numb from the waist down.  Wiggled his toes to get the heating pads in his socks working again.  He expected to sit with his brother another hour at least so it surprised him to see Joe picking up his thermos, empty lunch pail, rifle.  Irving followed him down the ladder and waited until Joe had finished scattering seeds, berries and herbs around the base of the tree where they'd sat--a belief taught by their native mother (a Mi'k Maq native who'd lived on the Shubenacadie Reserve as a child) to appease Nature for any unruffling they might have caused during their hunting and to assure a good catch the next day. <P align=justify>
 It never worked. <P align=justify>
 Joe made sure he was at least five feet away from the offering before lighting up a menthol.  Took a few puffs to get it going and continued.<P align=justify>
"So anyway, I always said I wanted that '69 Dodge and she always said how much she wanted a diamond ring.  'Could change the world with a diamond ring,' she'd say."<P align=justify>
They got to the clearing where they could see the light from the house, the one in the living room.  Joe had a house facing the wrong direction.  The living room faced the woods, in the back, and the back door faced the road, in the front.  Irving kept watch on the house as they neared, looking for Honey's hand in the window.  She used to wait there, coffee in one hand, cigarette in the other, leaning against the glass until she saw them.  When she waved, the movement was tight and quick so that it looked as if she were scratching a spot off the window.<P align=justify>
 "When Sobeys called to tell her she won the damned ring you woulda thought she'd won a million dollars.  She went nuts, you know?  Now that the novelty's worn off it's like she's got no more reason to live," Joe said. <P align=justify>
 Irving couldn't imagine life without Honey. Honey was the one who'd taught him to kiss (before she'd married Joe) and how to eliminate the smell of marijuana from his clothing.  She never had much but always made sure there was an extra potato in the pot or an extra chicken bone in the soup in case anyone dropped by.  She was a good soul. That's what everyone called her, a good soul. <P align=justify>
"Comin' in?" Joe asked.  Irving looked beyond his brother into the living room where the television jumped from channel to channel--news, sports, comedy, weather, porn.   He saw a heel (too bulky to be Honey's) sticking out of a thread-bare sock from the corner of the couch and figured Walter must have come home for a few nights.  Walter had moved out of the house when he turned sixteen and lived with his girlfriend in her mother's basement.  Came home whenever they had a fight and stayed until Joe gave him the you-made-yer-bed-now-go-lie-in-it speech.  <P align=justify>
Irving shook his head and said, "No, I've got some things to do," even though they both knew that was a lie. <P align=justify>
  In the morning, the television and lights were still on in the house.  Irving waited at the front door at five minutes before seven.  He rarely ventured past the threshold uninvited.<P align=justify>
When the door opened, cigarette smoke curled out, pulling with it the smell of fresh coffee and toast.  Joe's face was unshaven, teeth unbrushed, hair uncombed.  Irving  looked beyond the scowling man.  Heard the flip-flop of her slippers and caught a glimpse of her terry cloth housecoat just before Joe pulled the door closed.  <P align=justify>
 "How's she doing?" Irving asked.  Joe walked ahead and led the way across the backyard, around the sharp, jutting edge of the same rock where Walter (as a young child) had chipped his tail bone after slipping from his swing in mid-air.  <P align=justify>
"Did I tell you she made me take her to a restaurant the first night she got the ring? Belmont's.  Most expensive place in town.  Place is black tie only and I don't own anything like that.  Still, Honey made me take her.  We both saw the looks we got but Honey pretended not to notice.  When the manager came she held up her hand--the one with the ring on it--and swung it around, you know, pointing to things and waving to people she didn't know."<P align=justify>
They were at the place Irving hated most, the six foot strip of path surrounded by rotting moss and ragweed.  The dank smell never went away, whether it was a dry spell in summer or a sodden rainy day.  Where the roots of two great Oaks met, a couple of two-by-fours had been set down to cover the spot where the water and sludge pooled beneath.  Irving had to concentrate not to slip, his boots losing track on the slimy boards. <P align=justify>
"We didn't get in.  Knew we wouldn't, but Honey was heart-broken.  She really figured that ring was gonna get her places.  You know?  I told her that's not how life works.  You gotta be somebody to get in these places.  It don't matter that you won a diamond ring from Sobeys."<P align=justify>
 Irving remembered the first time Honey ever spoke of a diamond ring.  That was in the beginning, before anyone really knew her.  Before she was considered part of the family.<P align=justify>
 Honey talked a lot to Irving because he listened.  She'd told him how she wanted to be a model or an actress or a country singer.  Irving was a dreamer where Joe was ground in the earth.  Joe would have said, "That's probably not going to happen.  That's why you got me to look after you," whereas Irving would have said something like, "Anything's possible."  Honey liked both men--boys at the time--and needed a little bit of what each of them offered.  When Joe proposed marriage, she accepted.<P align=justify>
"We didn't get in the restaurant, but that wasn't the end of it.  Next thing she wants to join the golf club.  She broke my mug on the kitchen floor when I laughed at her.  But I went along with it anyway.  We bought a couple a white shirts with those fruity collars and went down to register.  Honey asked for the credit card before we got inside so she could make sure the guy at the desk saw the diamond.  I saw the clerk's eyebrows raise when he caught a look at the ring but his face went dead when he saw the likes of us."<P align=justify>
Irving rummaged through his lunch box the minute they sat down.  He enjoyed the camaraderie of hunting but feared he'd never be able to shoot a deer if he saw one.  Joe, on the other hand, was always ready, rifle strapped to his shoulder.  His eyes and ears scanned the area for any sign of wildlife while he spoke.<P align=justify>
"The guy pretended to put our credit card through the machine then gave us this big apology about how our credit was no good.  He didn't say those words exactly but that's what he meant.  Hell, I was glad anyway.  No way I can afford a five hundred dollar membership."<P align=justify>
When they were young, Irving would listen to Honey sing while she went about her business.  Joe always told her she was a good "shower singer", but never realized how much that hurt her.  <P align=justify>
 "Anyway, that's not the best part.  You wanna know what she's done now?" Joe asked.  Irving extended his right arm with a swinging motion, his forearm sinking with a poof  into the folds of Joe's hunter-orange jacket.<P align=justify>
"What the hell ya doin'?" Joe asked.  Irving did it again.  Then, Joe understood.  In the clearing, about eight feet ahead of them, stood the biggest deer they'd seen since their hunting expedition.  Joe rolled onto his knees and lifted his rifle.  Irving held his breath.  Joe kept his eye on his target, waiting for the flicking white tail to turn until the full body came into view.  It moved out of sight and then reappeared, antlers first.  Joe waited another second.  It moved forward.  He saw the neck, the body and BANG, he shot it.<P align=justify>
Irving exhaled and swallowed. Joe scrambled over the side of the shelter and charged straight through brush and pickers to get to his trophy.  <P align=justify>
"Look at this, would ya?" Joe said.<P align=justify>
"Beautiful," Irving said, although Joe misunderstood that for "good job".  <P align=justify>
Joe tagged it and tied the legs together.  "Help me carry this outta here," he said.<P align=justify>
The men dragged the carcass.  Stopped twice to rest.  Irving took the hind legs so he wouldn't have to look at the face. <P align=justify>
"Go in the house and get Honey," Joe said when they reached the backyard.  <P align=justify>
Irving hesitated.
 "What's a matter?  Go deaf from the buck shot?  I said go get Honey!" Joe said.  Irving took the patio steps two at a time.  Stopped long enough to knock twice before going inside.  There were dishes piled in the sink, clean and drying, and tracks across the living room rug where it'd just been vacuumed.  He took a few steps forward and then did a duck-swooping backwards step to avoid walking into a strip of fly paper which was hanging from the ceiling.  <P align=justify>
"Joe?  S'that you?" Honey called from the bedroom.   Irving opened his mouth to say no, but changed his mind and walked into the bedroom unannounced (hoping to see what, he wasn't sure).  <P align=justify>
"Thought you were Joe," she said.  She was sitting on the edge of the bed clipping her toenails, left foot raised over a blue plastic bucket.  Wore only her underwear and a Save-The-Planet, Use-Farts-For-Fuel tee-shirt.  Although her legs were tiny, they were puckered along the outsides and covered with fine red veins which branched from one to the other.  She had a rip in her underwear that revealed a few stray, brown hairs.  Irving cleared his throat.<P align=justify>
"I should have knocked," he said.  <P align=justify>
"It's okay," she said, lowering her leg.  She pushed the bucket back towards the night stand and stretched out on the bed, on her belly.  She cupped her face in her hands and Irving saw, for the first time, the diamond ring.  It was big, round, and perched on a very thin coil of gold.  He'd imagined it to shine with enough power to transform Honey's usual downcast face into something warmer, more energetic.  Perhaps at one time it had shone that way.  Now, it was dull.  It lacked spark, shine, spirit.   Honey and the ring were a perfect match.
"Are you okay?" he asked.  Honey shook her head.  She was sullen, a child being punished for a wrong-doing.
"Joe says you won't get out of bed," he said.  <P align=justify>
"I get up once in a while."  <P align=justify>
 She made a face and grinned.<P align=justify>
"Did Joe tell you the news?" she asked.  Irving shook his head.  He moved to the window to see if Joe was getting impatient. <P align=justify>
"What news?" he asked.<P align=justify>
"I'm gonna be a model!" she said.  Irving turned and looked at her.  <P align=justify>
"A hand model!" she said, waving her diamond-ring hand in the air.  Whatever demons had settled behind her eyes a few moments earlier were exorcized for the time being. <P align=justify>
"Can you believe it?  There's a dish detergent company that's doin' a commercial over in Boston and they're lookin' for a hand model.  I found out about it in the newspaper and sent them a picture of my hand!" she said.
"You always wanted to be a model," Irving said.  <P align=justify>
"Yeah, but not really.  More a country singer than anything else.  Anyway," she said, "Isn't this just the best?"  Irving agreed that it was, but doubted if  Joe felt the same way. <P align=justify>
"Tell her to get her ass out here!" Joe said, his muffled words barely audible through the closed window.  "Roll her out of bed if you have to."<P align=justify>
"What does he want?" Honey asked.  <P align=justify>
"He shot a deer," Irving said.  Honey moved to the window.<P align=justify>
"Well I'll be damned," she said.  "Deer steak for dinner."<P align=justify>
"He wants you to go outside to see it," Irving said.  Honey ignored the comment and instead replied with, "I gotta get a ticket. Suppose to be in Boston Wednesday night.  First shoot's Thursday morning." <P align=justify>
   Honey paused.
"This is something. Isn't it?" she said.  <P align=justify>
"Is there anything you need?" Irving asked and he knew why.  There'd be no photo shoot in Boston.  She had a history of choosing the wrong things, taking the wrong turn when the pressure was on, backing away at any chance of success. Some would say she had bad luck, but Irv<P align=justify>ing believed it to be of her own doing. 
 The pattern started as a teenager when she'd chosen to marry Joe.  Nobody in the world (except Honey) knew Irving had proposed marriage to her once.  There hadn't been any bended knee, or even a ring for that matter.  He'd sensed the time was coming closer when Joe would be making bigger plans and so he'd said it in a hurry, as they ran from the mall to the car in a pouring rain storm.  They'd been Christmas shopping for Joe.  <P align=justify>
"I'd like to marry you someday, Honey," Irving had said.  Honey had laughed.<P align=justify>
"No, really.  I'd like to marry you," he'd said again.  And that was that.  A week later, Joe proposed and Honey accepted. <P align=justify>
"I should get some new clothes before I go," Honey said.  In the four steps it took him to get from the window to the door, Honey had her panties off.  Irving didn't look.  One of the reasons he avoided the house.  Honey was always doing things like that.<P align=justify>
"You should come shopping with me," she said.  "Like old times."  <P align=justify>
Irving kept walking, down the hallway, to the kitchen and out the door.  He heard Honey's footsteps behind him but didn't turn to see if she'd put on another pair of panties.<P align=justify>
"Look at this Honey," Joe said.  "Ain't she something?"  <P align=justify>
 Irving kept his eyes pinned to the antlers.  <P align=justify>
"Yeah, she's a beaut," Honey said from the kitchen door.  She wrapped her arms across her stomach, shivering.  "But don't ask me to help you cut up that meat.  Gotta keep my hands nice," she said. <P align=justify>
 Joe made a sound, like a snort, and shook his head, confirming for Irving his thoughts on Honey becoming a hand model.  <P align=justify>
"Irving thinks it's great," she said.<P align=justify>
"And where the hell you gettin' the money for this?" Joe asked.<P align=justify>
"None a your business were I get the money," she said.<P align=justify>
"We know you can't do it, Honey.  So you may as well forget it," Joe said.  He walked to the garage and swung the doors open.  Inside, he pushed and pulled things around to make room for the deer.<P align=justify>
"I'll get Freddy to cut her up for me tonight," Joe said into the air.<P align=justify>
"You're gonna be some goddamned surprised," Honey shouted.  She sniffled and slumped her shoulders but surprised both men by not breaking down. <P align=justify>
"Will you take me into town tomorrow morning Irving?" she asked.  The three stood transfixed, Honey's eyes on Irving, Irving's eyes on Joe and Joe's face smirking at Honey.<P align=justify>  
"Take 'er where ever she wants to go," Joe said.  He shrugged and shook his head. Mumbled under his breath, "I'll be glad when this foolishness is over."<P align=justify>
Irving remained silent which Honey construed as agreement.<P align=justify>
"Good then," she said.  "Nine?"  <P align=justify>
 "Sure," Irving said.  He was uncomfortable.  Didn't feel right about being alone with Honey.<P align=justify>
The next morning, Wednesday, Honey was subdued.  She was ready at the door, a single piece of luggage in hand, and a velvet box in the other.<P align=justify>
"You okay?" Irving asked.  She smiled a quick smile, and then it was gone.<P align=justify>
"I'm selling the ring," she confided.  In her lap, she held the burgundy velvet box in which it came. <P align=justify>
"But the ring was your dream," Irving said.  <P align=justify>
"I'm selling it for another one." <P align=justify>
  And that was when Irving knew she was going to do it.  She would sell the ring, take the money for a ferry ticket (and whatever else she might need), and go.  Irving didn't dare speak.  Sometimes his intonation didn't match his sentiment, and he feared Honey would misconstrue anything he said. Her eyes were on his cheek and he turned his head briefly, offering her a smile, an easy punch of encouragement to the leg.  Turned the radio up.<P align=justify>
Her favorite song.  <P align=justify>
"So how's your kissing coming along?" she asked.  "Must be over twenty years since your last lesson," she puffed out a short laugh.<P align=justify>
Just slip out the back jack<P align=justify>
"I can give you one last lesson, if you want," she said hopefully.<P align=justify>
Make a new plan, Stan.<P align=justify>
 Irving chuckled and cleared his throat.  He opened the window a bit, to let in some cool air.
Just get yourself free.<P align=justify>
"That's what I'm going to do.  Finally," she said.  Irving pulled the visor down, then flipped it back.<P align=justify>
"You know," she said.  "Get myself free."  <P align=justify>
Irving made a big deal of adjusting the rearview mirror.  <P align=justify>
"Come with me," she said.  <P align=justify>
Irving snapped the blinker on and turned left, headed for town.<P align=justify>
"You're my brother's wife," he said.  Honey snapped the velvet box open and closed.<P align=justify>
"Did you really want to marry me back then?" she asked.  <P align=justify>
Snap.<P align=justify>
"Yeah," he said, and then followed with, "But you made your choice."<P align=justify>
Snap.<P align=justify>
"Guess I thought I could have you both," she said.  A cat darted across the road.  Irving slammed the brakes and swerved. <P align=justify>
"I'm just teasin'," she said. <P align=justify> 
"You've been teasing for twenty years."<P align=justify>
Honey chewed her lip.<P align=justify>
"Here," he said, shifting his weight to remove his wallet from his back pocket.  "Take my credit card.  You can buy your ticket with it.  Keep the ring."<P align=justify>
 "Are you trying to get rid of me?" she said.  Tried to sound playful but couldn't quite pull it off.<P align=justify>
"How come you never got married?" she asked after a few minutes of uncomfortable silence.<P align=justify>
"Just never worked out with anyone," he said.  His eyes began to water and he felt a tickle at the back of his throat.<P align=justify>
"Are you okay?" she asked.<P align=justify>  
He sneezed.<P align=justify>
"Yeah," he said.  <P align=justify>
"You could come with me," she said again.  He pulled into the Bay Ferries parking lot and shut off the engine.<P align=justify>  
"Just go," he said.   Turned the key down to listen to the radio without idling the car.  She was about fifteen minutes, getting her ticket, and came back with the credit card between her teeth. <P align=justify>
"Here," she said, passing it back.  "Thanks."<P align=justify>
"So you're all set?" he asked.  She said that yeah, she was.  <P align=justify>
"Still got an hour or so to wait but you don't have to stay."<P align=justify>
Irving felt under the seat and gave the lever a tug.  Reclined his seat and closed his eyes.   He felt the tickle of her hair against his cheeks seconds before her warm, sweet breath reached him.  Her mouth covered his closed lips, twisting and prying their way into him.  He groaned (meant to be a sound of protest) and pushed himself upright, with Honey still attached to his face.<P align=justify>
 "I'm gonna miss you," she said, and then, "I think I'll wait inside."  <P align=justify>
Irving let her go.  He rolled down the window.
"There's a reason you wouldn't marry me, isn't there?" he asked.<P align=justify>
Honey turned and set her luggage on the cracked pavement while she rummaged in her purse for a cigarette.  She lit one, took a drag, and on the exhale said, "I knew Joe would let me go when I was ready."<P align=justify>
She retreated and to her back Irving said, "Are you sure you're ready?"  <P align=justify>
He opened the door, stood, and then climbed back in the car.  To his right the burgundy velvet box lay on the seat.  The box was open but the ring was gone.<P align=justify>
