<CENTER>
It is not what we take from this world, <br>
but rather that which we give to it<br>
that leads to our own happiness; <br>
for the seeds of kindness<br>
grow into the blossoms of joy.<p>

There once was a woman, working in my department, <br>
who was difficult to deal with and most people tried to avoid her,
<br>
ignore her and unfortunately speak ill of her, behind her back. <br>

But there was one man, with a stony face that hid a tender heart,
<br>
who would let her prattle on, knowing that Sylvia was only
lonely<br>
and sought to fill the empty spaces of her life<br>
with the chatter of her own voice.<p>

One day, while no one was looking, Sylvia fell ill with cancer <br>
and was off work for nearly a year. <br>
When she returned, some people were a little kinder while others,
<br>
again, grew weary of her constant chatter. <br>
But the man with the stony face still listened to her worries and
her<br>
fears as she told him that while she was sick she had laid in bed,
<br>
looking out the window at a blossoming fruit tree and wondered
if<br>
she would live to see it bloom again... <br>
...and when the tree bloomed that next spring, <br>
she told him how happy those little blossoms made her feel. <p>

In the fall of that same year, Sylvia developed a cough<br>
that would not go away. <br>
She refused to see a doctor until the man with a stony face<br>
gave her no choice. <br>
She tried making excuses for not taking the test,<br>
but they fell upon deaf ears as he told her that he<br>
would pick her up at her house, drive her to the hospital<br>
and then drive her home again. <br>
She asked if he would really do this and the man's stony face
softened<br>
and he begged her to let him help her. <br>
Two days later they went to the clinic together for the lung biopsy.
<br>
The ride home was silent and long. <br>
As he reached out to hold her hand, <br>
she spoke the dreaded news, <br>
"The cancer is back." <br>
The man softly replied, <br>
"I know." <br>
He gave her a hug and finally said, <br>
"We will leave it in God's Hands."<p>

A week later, Sylvia flew back to her parent's home, <br>
in New York, and waited for God's release. <br>
Just before her passing, she called and spoke one final time <br>
to the man with the stony face<br>
and those sitting near saw that there were tears in his eyes. <br>
At her memorial service, he shared these simple words with<br>
all who had worked with her:<p>

"Each of us have our own thoughts and remembrances of Sylvia. <br>
I would like to share with you my memory of her. <br>
I spoke to her about a month prior to her passing. <br>
She was suffering terribly, <br>
much more than any of us could ever know. <br>
She told me that she had been ill for so long that she no longer<br>
remembered what it felt like to be well and whole. <br>
But through it all, she clung to the hope of returning home, <br>
to work and to her friends. <br>
She thanked me and told me that I had helped her in ways <br>
that I could never understand. <br>
The last words she ever spoke to me are the ones that <br>
I will remember forever,<br>
they were:<p>

'I love you.' "<p>

The man with the stony face often thinks of Sylvia, <br>
especially in the Spring, as the fruit trees bloom; <br>
and he knows that she gave to him, as he gave to her<br>
and he would not trade their moment together <br>
for all the wealth that has ever existed. <p>
