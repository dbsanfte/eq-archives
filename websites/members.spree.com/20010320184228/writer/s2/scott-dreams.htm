<P>	 Miss Foley sits on the floor in front of a semi circle of six year
olds.  "What do you dream of being when you grow up?" she asks
he pony tail wearing girls and freckle faced boys. </P> 
 
<P>     Bryan doesn't hesitate, "I am going to be a firefighter like my
Uncle Gregg.  He is SOOOO  brave and his truck is SOOOO cool!"</P>

<P>      Kayla smiles, eyes clear as a bell, "I am going to be a movie
star!"  She laughs and adds, "I might be a movie star before I grow
up."</P>

  <P>   The other children respond with their future careers being as
diverse as Gold Medal winning figure skater for Charlene and Professional
baseball player for Todd.</P>

 <P>    As Bryan, Kayla, Charlene and Todd grow and develop, they
may  realize that these dreams are indeed lofty.  They may achieve 
these particular dreams.  On the other hand, chances are that these
dreams will be out of reach.</P>

 <P>   Entering adulthood, they have several choices: they can follow 
the lead of author Napolean Hill and decide to "Cherish your visions
and your dreams as they are the children of your soul; the blue prints
of your ultimate accomplishments."  They may look deep within their
initial dreams and literally give birth to even more powerful, life 
changing, community and world altering visions.   Or, they can decide
that dreams are impossible.  Not for them.</P>  

<P>   Todd  is attracted to bravery, physical prowess, adrenalin pumping,
challenging experiences.  If not winning the world series in the ninth
inning of the seventh game, he could follow a career path or create 
a lifestyle incorporating those experiences.  He could rock climb, 
or hang glide, or teach rock climbing or hang gliding.  He could 
teach baseball.  He could play on a community team.  He could 
work as a Stock broker, or an Attorney, or a Teacher in a tough
neighborhood inspiring students to living full and complete lives. 
Think for a moment: how could he express the qualities that made
him aspire to be a professional baseball player?</P>

      <P> As a teen, I had the desire to be the next Carly Simon.  As I
grew older, I literally fell asleep to that possibility.  I would certainly
never be as tall as she is, nor would I  marry a rock star like her, 
nor would I form a singing group with my sister.</P>

     <P>What I did do, though, is realize what it is about my favorite
singer that I could emulate through my life.   Carly Simon had a 
horrible stutter and awful stage fright.  To combat this, she sang. 
She started with her sister, Lucy, as the duo "The Simon Sisters." 
She parlayed this into a solo career, singing her way out of her
speech impediment.  She did not rest on the laurels of being heir 
to a publishing empire.  She created her own persona.  She was 
surrounded with  successful artistic people.  Her sister Joanna is
an accomplished Opera singer, sister Lucy went on to compose 
music for Broadway musicals and her brother, Peter is a photographer.  
 </P>
<P>    I can apply these lessons to my life as you can too.  I can do
those tasks which are the most fear inducing in order to minimize 
them, eventually erasing them by continuing to meet  them face to 
face instead of running from them.  I can continue to work on my
craft, writing even when I don't feel like it, using my eraser a lot,
and finding opportunities to meet and surround myself with other 
people who are writing, speaking, and coaching.  I am now a regular
at Open Mic night at Barnes and Noble here in Bakersfield.  This  
has been an incredibly fulfilling experience: reading my work for
an audience gives me that immediate response.  Powerful.  Life 
changing.  Magnetic.</P>
    
<P>   Dreams draw us forward, towards an even more fulfilling, joyful 
and abundant life.  Dreams build bridges between where we are 
now and where we can be in the future whether that means tomorrow,
six months from now or ten years from now.  Fueling our inner drive,
they make our feet light, our tasks exciting instead of burdensome
and our hopes infinitely possible.</P>

<P>Have you revisited your dreams lately?  Have you carefully examined
what they are beckoning you towards?  In the words of Henry David
Thoreau, "Dreams are the touchstones of our character."  What
are your touchstones calling you to be today?</P>
