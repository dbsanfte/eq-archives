	<P>The eraser hit the blackboard missing Miss Stevens's head by no more than an inch.  She whirled around and glared at us.  Her face got so red I thought she was going blow up like Yosemite Sam when his horse wouldn't whoa.  Then she screamed: "If that happens just one more time, I am keeping all of you after school until someone tells me who did it."  Then she turned back to the board.  The piece of chalk got her just behind the ear.  She screamed: "All right, I am going to take each one of you into the cloakroom, and until one of you tells me who did it you're all staying right here."
</P>
<P>With that, she went to the cloakroom door, and called the girl at the front of my row.  One thing I knew for sure, I was not saying anything!  I knew from experience what would happen to anybody who ratted on any of  "The Seventh Grade Outlaws".  That's what we called them.  Mark Chism, Robert Kanable, Harvey Jeffries, and Jimmy Chennault had all been thrown out of the Army and sent back to school.  They were all put in my seventh grade class even though they were 18 years old.  I will never understand why they were all put in the same classroom.  My best guess is that they didn't want to ruin any more classrooms than they had to.  But my classroom had a substitute teacher, Miss Stevens, who was not too stable to begin with, and she got a lot worse.
</P>
<P>Well, not surprisingly, no one ratted on the Outlaws so there we sat.  When the final bell rang, the principal came in and made a similarly futile plea for the person who did it to confess.  He said he would be in his office if anyone wanted to talk to him.  Of course, no one did.  So there we sat.  There were no bus schedules to meet, no parents picking kids up - we all walked or rode bikes to school.  But then it began to get dark.  The principal knew he had lost, but he had to do something.  He called Miss Stevens out of the room, and after some very loud talking in the hall, he came back in and told us we could leave.  The Outlaws had won again.
</P>
<P>The next day started with more threats from Miss Stevens.  When she turned to the board, two erasers got there before she did, but this time she was lucky (she thought).  She had caught a glimpse of who had thrown one of them, Robert Kanable.  She jerked him out of his seat accompanied by roars of laughter from the other Outlaws.  That was a sight to see.  Kanable was at least six inches taller and must have outweighed her by 100 lbs.  But she marched him out the door and down the hall to the principal's office.  We learned later that they called his dad (he didn't have a mother that we knew of), and his dad said that he couldn't get off work to come to the school.  So a few hours later, Kanable was brought back to the classroom.  That's when Miss Stevens literally just came apart.  She started screaming at the principal that she was not going to try to teach with 'that animal' in her class.  The principal took her outside where there was more crying, screaming, and loud talking.  Finally, the principal came back in and told us all to go to the study hall for the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>The study hall was the auditorium, and it was not really expected that anyone study there.  It was monitored by several teachers whose job was to just keep people quiet.  Well, when we got there, quiet was no longer an obtainable objective, so the teachers just settled for something less than an all out uproar.  
</P>
<P>Then the most outrageous thing happened that I have ever seen in my entire life.  Right in front of me Kanable took his pants down and Harvey Jeffries started to masturbate him!  I had never seen such a thing before, and I imagine the girls hadn't either, but no one said anything.  We just watched.  Kanable had what would later be described as a 'shit-eating grin' on his face, and Harvey just pumped him up and down faster and faster.  Some of the girls began to move slowly away which left some space for one of the teachers to see what was going on.  She screeched and charged down the aisle toward Robert and Harvey who was startled and stopped what he was doing.  When the teacher got to them her eyes rolled up into her head and she fainted and fell over the back of a seat.  By the time a second teacher who had been across the room arrived to see what the uproar was about, Kanable had zipped up, so she thought the only problem was with the teacher who had fainted.  She was helped to the health room, and the study hall resumed its general unruly commotion unsupervised by any teachers.  As far as we know nothing happened to Robert or Harvey.  It seemed that no one wanted to go up against these guys.  What was the use?  They were incorrigibles.  Not even the Army could do anything with them.
</P>
<P>The next day when we reported to our classroom we had a new teacher, Mr. Hawkins.  The principal asked us to give Mr. Hawkins our full cooperation.  Mr. Hawkins said that he understood that there had been some problems, but he was sure that we would all get along OK from then on.  We heard later that Mr. Hawkins had met privately before class with each of the Outlaws.  Much to our surprise the Outlaws didn't terrorize Mr. Hawkins like they had Miss Stevens.  We noticed that they pretty much came and went as they pleased though - something the rest of us were not allowed to do.  I guess since they were 18 they didn't really have to be in school, and Mr. Hawkins and the principal probably let them know that any more problems and they would be back in the Army - maybe even in the stockade.  In any case they didn't disrupt the classroom anymore.  But poor Miss Stevens.  Someone said she had had a nervous breakdown, but that she was doing better and in a few weeks they might let her go home.
</P>
<P>The Outlaws, unable to vent their meanness in class, took it to the playground.  It usually went like this.  One of the Outlaws would grab somebody's lunch and start to eat it.  Oh yeah, they could get their lunch back if they told a teacher, but then the outlaw would invite them to meet him out in the bayou after school.  This was such a regular occurrence that after school a crowd would automatically gather over at the bayou to watch the fights.  It was always the Outlaws that were involved.  Think about that.  Four 18 year old hoodlums getting their kicks by humiliating and beating up some 12 or 13 year olds.  
</P>
<P>Everybody got a turn including me.  That was one miserable afternoon I will tell you.  After the lunchtime invitation was issued by Mark Chism I stewed all afternoon about what to do.  If I didn't show up, he'd just catch me the next day.  There was no way to avoid it.  The question was how much of a fight to put up before caving in.  I had seen what happened to some guys who really tried to put up good fight.  One of them wound up going to the clinic for a broken nose, lost teeth, and some stitches.  
</P>
<P>When I got to the bayou there were already a lot of kids there.  My friends, the Crump St. gang were all there.  A fleeting thought: "There are a dozen of us and only four of them, we could " Yeah, right!  In my dreams.  It just didn't work that way.  It was 'Every kid for himself'.  They had taken their beatings, and now it was my turn.  Chism arrived so there we were.  I was waiting for the first punch.  Looking into Mark's eyes there was no sign of any emotion.  It looked like he wasn't really into this any more than I was.  But it had to be done, so he hit me on the shoulder.  I hit him back.  After a few more punches he hit me full in the face, and that was it.  I crumpled up and went down into the mud.  He stood over me for a few moments and then backed away.  I got up, and made my retreat toward the road home accompanied by the jeers of the kids who had wanted to see a good fight.  I walked home alone and vowed that I would let my friends do the same the next time they got called into the bayou.
</P>
<P>My problems with the Outlaws weren't limited to school.  One of them, Harvey, lived three streets over from Crump, and he walked home on the same route I did.  Frequently the other Outlaws would go home with him.  I started to ride my bicycle to school to increase my chances for avoiding them.  One day they caught me while I was unlocking my bike, and Harvey rode off on it while Robert and Jimmy held me.  The next day I asked him where it was, and he said it was at his house.  If I wanted it, I could come and get it.  Several days went by before my mother asked where my bike was.  I told her I had left it at school, and I got a scolding for that.  So I knew I had to go get it.
</P>
<P>The next day I went over to Harvey's house after school.   All of the Outlaws were there, and so was Harvey's brother, Harley (really!).  We all knew that Harley had been in jail for stealing a car, and he had been in a lot of other trouble too.  Man, was I scared!  I saw my bicycle in the garage so I just told them I had come for it, and went into the garage.  I got my bike, but when I turned around the Outlaws were blocking my way.  Then Harley came over and asked me if that was my bike.  I said that it was, and he said: "Well, go on and take it then."  So I started to move out of the garage, and the Outlaws just watched as I went by.  All of them had these devilish smirks on their faces, and as I got on the bike and rode away they all burst out laughing.  
</P>
<P>I guess Harvey was the worst of the four Outlaws.  One of my friends, George Hunt, who lived on Crump St. but never joined in any of the gang activities, got into a real problem with Harvey.  One day Harvey told George that he liked his shirt, and he wanted George to give it to him.  George refused and that, of course, led to a challenge to a bayou fight.  George played the piano, and he didn't want to get his hands messed up, so he gave Harvey the shirt.  Later, Harvey told George that he would like some more of George's clothes, and George began to make regular deliveries.  Finally, George's parents noticed a lot of clothes missing, but George wouldn't tell what had happened to them.   Harvey got away with it again.  He started asking a lot of other kids to give him clothes, but he spread it out so parents wouldn't likely notice.  Yeah, he got a nice windbreaker jacket off of me.
</P>
<P>You might wonder - did these guys ever get into enough trouble so that the police got involved.  Well, yeah, at least once that I know of.  One summer Harvey and Robert came over to David Stewart's and stole his cat out of the front yard.  Mrs. Stewart saw them out the front window so she got David and got in the car and drove over to Harvey's house.  The next thing we heard was that Harvey had been taken to Juvenile Hall - jail, finally!  What had happened was when Mrs. Stewart and David got to Harvey's house, they found that Harvey and Robert had tied a rope around the cat's neck, hung it over a tree limb, and they were batting it back and forth with a stick.  Even so, in a few days Harvey was back out on the street looking for more trouble.  
</P>
<P>When we reported to school for the eighth grade, we looked around with dread for the Outlaws, but they weren't there.  We guessed that they had all been taken back into the Army.  I never heard of any of them anymore except for one really strange incident many years later in the bus station in Raleigh, NC. 
</P>
<P>It was 1950, and I was waiting for a bus to take me to Washington for a Naval ROTC physical exam.  As I was sitting there a guy in a Marine uniform came over and said: "Are you Jimmy Weiss?"  It was Mark Chism.  He held out his hand, and I shook it.  He told me he was going to Camp Lejeune and from there to Korea.  I told him about my plans, and we chatted amiably for awhile until his bus left.  I thought how strange it was to talk to one of my tormentors from the seventh grade as if we had been buddies.  I guess years and distance can do that.  Still, I could never forgive him.  I hoped people would be really mean to him in Korea.
</P>
