<P>Boy, what a day we had today Mommy, wasn't it
wonderful!</P>


<P>Wasn't it responsible of me to knock down that glass
shelf with all the shampoo on it at the hairdressers to
show them how dangerous it might be for other children
to have it where they can reach it! I could tell you were
proud, I have never seen an expression quite like that on
your face before.</P>


<P>I did think it was a little odd for you to get only half you
hair cut, did you run out of money? It looks good, I like it
longer on one side than the other. Didn't those silver
things that the hairdresser was attacking you with look
dangerous, I tried to grab them off her but she wouldn't
let me get them. I was very good to protect you like that
wasn't I Mommy?</P>

<P>
Guess what I learnt today Mommy? I learnt that you can't
bang out the kinks in a shopping trolley with your head!
Isn't that interesting, I tried my hardest but it really did
start to hurt some so I was glad when you picked me up
and carried me for 45 minutes while you finished the
shopping. It was very kind of you Mommy to be so caring.</P>


<P>I am a little disappointed Mommy that you didn't show a
great deal of enthusiasm when I finally learnt how to get
out of the child restraint in the car. It's been 16 long
months of trying Mommy and I thought you could have
been a little more excited about it, it's not an easy thing to
do you know! You usually clap and cheer at my
accomplishments so perhaps you can consider that next
time I do it and give me a little round of applause.</P>


<P>I must say I am sorry for pouring all the dirt out of your
favorite potted plant onto the floor. I was checking it for
snails, how was I to know they didn't burrow? I'm just a
kid, I can't know everything!</P>


<P>Oh, I forgot to tell you, I ran some tests on the carpet
while you were in the shower. I wanted to see whether it
was stain resistant so I rubbed some of that dirt left over
from the potted plant into it. I should tell you that the test
results were not good Mommy, I think you should have it
checked, perhaps you could get it scotch guarded and I
will run further testing next week and let you know how it
goes.</P>


<P>I am sorry that I spat chocolate milk in your face
Mommy, I know how you love to drink a glass of
chocolate milk with me but I was very full from all that
dirt I ate earlier. I didn't want to disappoint you but when
I got the milk in my mouth I realised that I simply had no
room for it. Sorry, perhaps you should be more careful
that I don't eat before our milk time in the future.</P>

<P>
It is very early for a bath Mommy, do you need to go to
bed early tonight? I am not quite sure this will work out
Mommy, I don't feel at all tired just yet.</P>


<P>I am sorry for pouring the water from my boat on you
Mommy, I was aiming for the toilet but you sort of got in
the way. Perhaps you should change your clothes?</P>


<P>Mommy, you are looking very tired, you should take care
of yourself. After all -- you do have me to look after and
we can't have you getting sick. I am very cute when I
sleep you know, perhaps after I am dressed I can fall
asleep in your arms and you can look at me and think
about how cute I am, that should make you feel better.</P>
<P>

Here, let me lick your face and call it a kiss -- there, now
I bet you feel a whole lot better!</P>


<P>Oh what a day Mommy, wasn't that fun! What will we be
doing tomorrow? I might consider sleeping past 5am for
you in the morning Mommy, you look like you need some
rest, how would 5:30 be?</P>

<BR>
Love,<BR>
Samuel
