	<BR><BR>
	<FONT FACE="Courier New" COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1">
	<BR><P align=justify>
The regular army soldiers, to paraphrase F. Scott Fitzgerald, are
different from you and me. They have a separate roster of serial
numbers, a payroll all their own, and they are eligible for admittance
to the Old Soldiers Home in Washington, D.C. when they can no longer cut
it militarily. They pay a pittance each month toward the upkeep of the
home.
<P align=justify>
Staff Sergeant Martin was a regular army soldier. His back was straight,
his salute a snapped, shining example, and the way he held his head
attested to pride in what he was doing. The sergeant was in the
twenty-fourth year of his goal of being a thirty year career man. He had
spent years on the all-army rifle team and his footlocker teemed with
medals his expertise had brought him. On marksmanship training on the
range, he was a quiet man, a thorough man, who helped his charges do
their best without having to resort to the bark and bite manner of the
other non-coms.
<P align=justify>
When we went on a five mile march, the sergeant walked twice as far as
the rest of us, moving up and down the line and checking on the
condition of each of the men entrusted to him.  Back in camp from
sloshing through rain or snow or mud in hand to hand combat training,
Martin, once he had checked on us, would set about maintaining his
equipment before he finally hit the sack.
<P align=justify>
In short, Staff Sergeant Allen Martin was good at what he did because he
loved every moment of doing it. Ellie Mae, the wife of Staff Sergeant
Allen Martin was good at what she did. And she loved every moment of
doing it.
<P align=justify>
The good sergeant constantly got every "far from the post assignment and
pulled the most remote guard duty. He reasoned that this was proper,
because they had complete confidence in his ability.

<P align=justify>Once, out on a cossack post, one of the men was injured enough to
require help from a medical corpsman. The sergeant loaded him into a
jeep and took him to the base hospital. While waiting for the man's
release back to duty, Martin stopped by his non-com billets home to
change his shirt which had been stained by the blood of the injured
man.. He opened the door in time to see a soldier trying to put on his
pants and run at the same time. This seldom works. Ellie Mae, realizing
that nothing would help the situation now, just pulled up the covers and
prayed.
<P align=justify>
Martin caught the fleeing man just a few feet out the back door, and
would have dispatched him with his bare hands had he not been held back
by two other sergeants who had been lurking in the area in case Ellie
May found an opening in her busy schedule.
<P align=justify>
"Why pick on me," the unfortunate fugitive yelled. "Everybody's doing
it." The incident was too much for the ordered mind of Sergeant Martin.
It snapped, and he was sent to a psychiatric care unit and section
eighted out of the army. We missed having him as an instructor and role
model, and everything would have been better if we could have continued
to miss him. But he came into our khaki colored lives again.

<P align=justify>The guard at the front gate recognized him when he returned, and waved
him through. Then, questioning his own actions, the sentry called the
sergeant of the guard nd reported it. Two Mps took off after Martin's
car. Ex Sgt. Martin showed up at the Company B orderly room and was
greeted by the charge of quarters. In return for the greeting, he put a
.45 to the head of the CQ, handcuffed him, and took his keys. He then
opened the gun rack and took one of each type weapon secured there. He
opened the filing cabinet and took out a handful of service records. In
his twisted mind he had visions of using these to start his own military
unit.

<P align=justify>Finishing that, he set forth on his prime mission. He had forgiven the
men for what they did to him, but had transferred the guilt to the
company officers who failed to control the men. To set things straight,
he meant to kill them all.
<P align=justify>
As he entered the quarters where the officers were sleeping, the first
sergeant showed up on a mission to drag the C.O. out for a little late R
and R. He came through the door as Martin was leveling the .45. If he
rushed his former friend, it would be over before he could wrest the
piece from him. He took a different tack.
<P align=justify>"That son-of-a bitch is mine", he said, "You can have the rest of them."
He reached out his hand, and Martin, with years of reacting to commands,
handed him the gun, probably glad to have help in his effort.

<P align=justify>The first sergeant laid the butte of the weapon against his old buddy's
head and the two MPs, coming through the door, caught him as he fell.

<P align=justify>Ellie Mae, evicted from army living quarters, moved into an
establishment in the little town just outside the post enclosure. She
found that the commodity she had distributed on a friend or friend of a
friend basis had real financial potential.
<P align=justify>
This whole incident scared hell of the rest of us. If this could happen
to the perfect example of a U.S. Regular Army soldier, what could we
Kilroy come lately, ragged ass yardbirds expect from army life.

	<BR><BR>
	<FONT FACE="Courier New" COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1">	
	<BR>
<P align=justify>
It was Billy Crow that got us into it. We weren't even full grown yet
when he
started talking about how easy it was to make a living from a life of
crime.
<P align=justify>
"All we need is a couple of six-guns and the money will start rolling
in. Then
we can steal some horses and really be in business. I bet that railroad
train
comes through here twice a day is loaded with gold and payrolls and
such."
<P align=justify>
It didn't take much to convince us. After all, we were approaching that
age
when we needed loving and living and both cost money unless you were
luckier and handsomer than we were.
<P align=justify>
The guns came easy. Billy stole them from John Lundy who was so old he
didn't realize he had them anymore.
<P align=justify>
The horses were a different matter. We ended up taking them from the
hitching rack outside the saloon in the next town. We figured by the
time
their owners sobered up enough to miss them, we could make enough money
in our new business to buy our own.
<P align=justify>
We were waiting by the water tank outside town when the train came to a
stop to fill up.
<P align=justify>
"Jest follow me and do like I do," Billy told us. He had taken a silent
vote and
elected himself head honcho. He grabbed the handle by the door and swung
himself up the steps, then tripped and fell on his face at the entrance
to the
car.
<P align=justify>
Dillard Ennis surveyed the situation, then obediently fell on his.
<P align=justify>
To hell with these kid games, I thought, so I waited for them to get
over their
foolishment.
<P align=justify>
Billy made it to his feet and pulled his gun from his britches.
<P align=justify>
"Give me all your money and jewelry," Billy told the first passenger he
came to.
<P align=justify>
"Why should I?" the executive type man with the big cigar asked.
<P align=justify>
"I don't know, but if you're still holding on to it when I think of a
good reason I'll blow your fool head off," Billy advised him. It didn't
occur to him that the big gun he held in his hand was reason enough.
<P align=justify>
One by one the passengers divested themselves of their belongings and we
train-robbers had quite a stash of loot. We were so busy raking in the
filthy lucre that we didn't notice the train had started and was rapidly
rolling down the rails, leaving our horses far behind.
<P align=justify>
When the engine finally slowed almost to a stop going up White Oak
Mountain we jumped off and looked around. Not a building, not a tree,
not a bit of shade could we see.
<P align=justify>
"Who's the damn fool didn't think of how we were going to git back?"
Billy wanted to know. "I figger out who it is I'll kick his sorry ass
all the way to Albuquerque."
<P align=justify>
"Why we going to Albuquerque?" Jim Shane wanted to know.
<P align=justify>
Billy gave him a sharp swipe with the butte of his gun and Jim didn't
insist on an answer.
<P align=justify>
Cowboy boots ain't made for walking, and felt hats just keep the sun's
rays out and the sweat in. Half hour of hiking made us a sorry lot of
bad men.
<P align=justify>
"Right now I'd give my share of the take for a cold glass of water and a
good piece of ass," Buffalo Bart opined.
<P align=justify>
"Way you been sweating bullets ain't enough juice left in you for a
lay," Billy said.
<P align=justify>
"Maybe not, but I could sure dry-hump myself to death and die happy."
<P align=justify>
The conversation stopped when a band of half a dozen horsemen came over
the rise. The distinctive sombreros and gaudy clothes identified them as
Mexicans. Their general appearance made them out as banditos.
<P align=justify>
"You got any water?" Billy Crow wanted to know.
<P align=justify>
"All the water you want two miles over the rise. You want to swap for
some fresh horses?"
<P align=justify>
"What'll you do without them?"
<P align=justify>
"Remount station not too far away. We walk there and pick up new
mounts."
<P align=justify>
"How much you want for 'em?"
<P align=justify>
"We don' need money. Got plenty. What we need is guns to protect what we

got. Give you our three horses for your three guns."
<P align=justify>
Three guns were all we had among us.
<P align=justify>
"Sounds good to me. Here's my piece. You sure there's water two miles
that way ?"
<P align=justify>
"Why would I lie to you? You'd just find out I was lying."
<P align=justify>
The other two handed over their weapons.
<P align=justify>
"Muchas gracias, Amigos." The bandits pointed the hand-guns at bank
robbing Bill Crow. "Now hand over them bags you're carrying. Pronto."
<P align=justify>
Billy looked at them in disbelief.
<P align=justify>
"You're robbing us?" he wailed, "We're train-robbers. We're your kind of
people."
<P align=justify>
"Bet yore left tit we're robbing you. Anybody wouldn't rob a damn fool
bunch like yourn oughta be singing in a church choir. Oughta have their
train-robbing license took away."
<P align=justify>
They rode off without bothering to check the contents of the bags.
<P align=justify>
"Only a empty headed loon would fall for an old trick like that. I ought
horse-whip you two for going along with it." Billy growled.
<P align=justify>
Neither man answered. Buffalo Bart was thinking about a glass of cold
water. Dillard was trying to figure out how he ever joined up with this
complete idiot, and I was remembering that Mama told me to stay from
this bunch.
<P align=justify>
After we had walked three hours in the desiccating sun we found
themselves at a set of railroad tracks.
<P align=justify>
"We're in luck. Here's how we git out of here. When the train comes
along we hitch a ride to where it's going and then try to borrow enough
dinero to get back where we come from. Except for losing our horses and
our guns we ain't no worse off than when we started. The loot wasn't
ours 'til we robbed
the train."
<P align=justify>
In the distance they heard a whistle. The smoke from the engine darkened
the sky. The train slowed down as it approached and we four exhausted
not-quite-men climbed aboard. In the first car was a familiar looking
big man with a cigar.
<P align=justify>
This time he held a carbine across his lap.
<P align=justify>
"Good to see you gentlemen again. This trip back it's my turn." He
motioned to
the Conductor while holding the gun on us. "Lock these buzzards up until
we get back to civilized territory. I think they're going to have a
story
to tell the Marshal."
<P align=justify>
That's when I decided a life of crime wasn't for me. The judge looked me
over
and decided I didn't fit in with the others. I got two years probation,
providing I got a job and stayed out of trouble. That's why I'm
shoveling away here in the livery stable. It was the only job in town
and I'm sure not
going to get on that train to go to one some place else. No telling who
you'll find sitting in a railroad car or what he'll have across his
knees.

	<FONT FACE="Courier New" COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1">
<BR>
<P align=justify>
The cell was about eight feet by ten. It was one of six in what had been
the Sheriff’s Office
before a new County facility had been built. The guard pushed one of the
levers at the end
of the row and the cell door was unlocked. He turned the handle and
opened the door for the
visitor to go in. The prisoner had been remanded to this sub-standard
facility because they
couldn’t protect him from the inmates at the regular prison.
<P align=justify>
 A single-faucet sink was on the cement block back wall. An enamel
slop-jar, the only toilet utility, was beside it. A mesh-covered single
light bulb was in the center of the stucco ceiling.
<P align=justify>
The prisoner sat on a steel cot, his head in his hands. Stubble covered
what had been a handsome
face and his hair looked like it hadn’t been combed in a week. His voice
was harsh when he spoke and sounded as if he had been crying.  The blue
prison garb hung loose on him, as if it might once
have fitted him before he wasted away.
<P align=justify>
"God knows I didn’t do it," he said. "I loved Ellie too much to take her
life. It pained me to know
how they found her, shot dead and lying on the cold ground. She was the
only good thing ever to
come into my miserable life. I changed for her. I stopped drinking and
gambling and tried to find
a job to support her and my child. Her Pa told her if she married me
he’d turn her picture to the
wall and never look on her face again. He didn’t know she was going to
have a baby, but it
wouldn’t have changed his mind."
<P align=justify>
"If you didn’t do it," the visitor asked, "Why did you run? Why didn’t
you stay and help find the
one who did it?"
<P align=justify>
"I wouldn’t have had a chance. Her Pa and her kin took up their
Winchesters and came hunting me soon as she was found. I ran away to
stay alive until I could think of some way to help.
I was glad when the Mount Airy Sheriff caught me and put me in jail. I
thought I would be
safe there. All six weeks I was there I prayed they’d find the killer
and I could come home to
cry over the grave of my love and my unborn child."
<P align=justify>
"Folks say you killed her because you didn’t want to be tied down to a
wife and child. They say
you’ve been a wastrel so long you wouldn’t know how to live a good
life."
<P align=justify>
"A good woman can change a man. And Ellie was as good as they come.
Before I quit drinking
she’d walk two miles in the snow to get me liquor when I needed it the
morning after a drunken
night. Many times she got up at two o’clock in the morning to make a
fire in the wood stove
to fix hot biscuits and fry chicken for me when I hadn’t eaten all day.
The girl was a saint.
She was too good for me or for anyone else in this cold, heartless
town."
<P align=justify>
"You swapped a cord of wood for a pistol not long before she was killed.
They claim that’s the
weapon she was killed with."
<P align=justify>
"I got the gun to kill myself if Ellie decided to go along with her Pa
and not marry me. I didn’t
get it to harm her. I threw it away a few days after I bought it because
it looked like everything
was going to be all right." He lifted his head for the first time and
looked at the man in black
standing before him.  "I don’t recognize you. What church you from? Of
course I wouldn’t
know you if you was from the one a few doors down from my place, I ain’t
been in one in
so long. God and drinking and gambling never mixed too well. But I’m
sure glad you came.
I want to make my peace with God before they take my life away. I want
to be able to see the
one I love in the hereafter, and maybe make up for the things I did
wrong here on earth."
<P align=justify>
The visitor placed his hand on the young man’s greying hair. Two months
ago it had been
coal black.
<P align=justify>
"Rest in peace, my Son, and find help in the fact that you will sin no
more. Things are going
to be pretty bad for you in the coming days. When you feel they are too
much to bear, take
these pills. They will help you bear the pain." He handed a small vial
to the sobbing prisoner.
<P align=justify>
"Guard, I’m ready," the dark suited visitor called. The guard let him
out and he went his way.
<P align=justify>
It was three days later when the guard brought in a breakfast plate and
found the prisoner dead
in the cell. During the night he had heard moaning and groaning, but
that was usually the case
in the small prison.
<P align=justify>
"The coroner said he took poison," The Sheriff told the newspaper
reporter. "He must have
had it stashed away where we couldn’t find it. Doc said he must have
spent the night in
great agony. Wonder why he didn’t get something that would let him die
easy? I thought he
made his peace when that preacher was here, and would be all right for
the new trial. Guess
he just snapped."
<P align=justify>
"Who was that Preacher anyway," the reporter asked. "I’ve talked to
every Man of God in
the county and no one ever heard of Reverend Jimson. Must have been some
Journeyman
Preacher. Holy Roller or Pentacostal or something."
<P align=justify>
"Jimson," the Sheriff mused. "Wasn’t that Ellie"s mother’s maiden name?"
