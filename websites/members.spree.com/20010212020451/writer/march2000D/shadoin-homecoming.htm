<P align=justify>
1969 was a trying time for almost everyone in the United States. It was
no different in Rock Creek. No, there wasn't any antiwar demonstrations
or kids burning draft cards or bras, but there was a community unrest
that was hard to ignore. The unrest stemmed from the missing young men
from the fields and homes in and around Rock Creek. As the mothers of
Rock Creek had always done when asked, they surrendered their share of
boys to the war in Vietnam.
<P align=justify>
Some of those boys came home in passenger cars. Some came home in box
cars. But all of them came home. All that is, except one.
<P align=justify>
Paul McAuley was the son of Louise and Louis McAuley, Lu and Louie Mac,
if you saw them playing pitch down at the VFW Club. Paul never came
home. The United States Marine Corp had no record of what happened to
Paul. His patrol was in a Huey shot down over some dank jungle and were
never heard from again. Officially, Paul is listed as missing in action.
But no one who survived from Paul's unit held any hope that they were
alive after the first month. They weren't released as POW's and the Red
Cross had no record of ever serving them in any Vietnamese prison.
<P align=justify>
About eighteen months after Paul was shot down, a Marine Major appeared
at the door of the McAuley's. Lu and Louie offered him iced tea and a
seat on the divan. The major had been the captain commanding the unit
that sent Paul's patrol out. He told the McAuley's how dreadfully sorry
he was he could bring no news, but rest assured, if he heard anything,
they would be the first to know. Louie walked him to the door, thanked
him for coming, and watched the green sedan leave long after it had
disappeared through the wheat fields. Louie didn't turn to look at Lu.
She wouldn't be there. She would be upstairs, laying on Paul's bed,
crying and praying that Paul be all right somehow. And somehow he would
defy the odds and make his way home.
<P align=justify>
Life for the Maculae's became a simple one of work, church, and home.
They were quiet and kept to themselves, unable even to stay at the VFW
where their friends were. Too embarrassed to show their face, ashamed of
their false hopes and self delusions, they kept themselves and
the secret prayer that soon they would be reunited with the son they
loved so much.
<P align=justify>
Like all children of Rock Creek, Paul was at home outdoors. He hunted
and fished and knew how to find his way home on a moonless night. There
were no bogeymen in the lives of Rock Creek youths. He was better
equipped than most Marines at the art of woodcraft and survival. There
was some hope. It was slim hope. But there was some hope anyway.
<P align=justify>
In 1989, a battered old van was seen parked under the trestle bridge. A
hairy man in his late thirties, early forties began camping there. He
gathered up fallen limbs and dried grasses, started a cooking campfire,
and set about catching fish with an old buggy whip fly rod and poorly
tied flies.
<P align=justify>
The Locals caught wind of the squatter by mid afternoon. Rockhead and
John the Liar were
headed to the Trestle Pool to try out some new flies they had tied when
they ran across this hermit, living in his van/cave. The stranger saw
them coming and quickly gathered his fishing gear and retreated to the
safety of his fire. Rockhead and John did what they came to do, nodded
at the unwashed man, and headed to Clem's Feed Store to report what they
had seen.
<P align=justify>
The Locals had seen hobos, hitchhikers, and runaways all take up
residence under the trestle bridge. None ever stayed long. They never
went out of their way to harass or welcome the strangers. They respected
them as lone individuals and let live. But this time it seemed
different. This fellow seemed like he meant to stay. No transients had
ever arrived equipped to fly fish before.
<P align=justify>
Clem worked the stretch of water below the trestle pool early the next
morning. Partly he was there to fish, partly to make the acquaintance of
the van's hermit. While he watched, the stranger emerged from the van.
The stranger greeted the morning with some enthusiasm. He grabbed a
bucket and headed for the water. There he dipped a bucket full of cool
clear Rock Creek water
and carried it back to the van. Part he poured into his coffeepot, part
he set on the fire to boil. While the bucket of water boiled, he took a
pair of scissors from a small ditty bag and adjusted the van's mirror so
that he could give himself a haircut. He either didn't see Clem, or
didn't pay him any heed. The vagrant trimmed his hair as best he could,
and then his beard. After the beard was trimmed, he got the hot bucket
of water from the fire and gave himself a first class sponge bath,
completing the toilette with a straight-razor shave. The now clean
vagrant reached into his van and pulled out a pair of new blue jeans and
a brand new T-shirt. Clem watched the man carefully comb his hair. Where
a dirty beggar had stood less than an hour before, Clem saw a road-worn
but somewhat handsome man. Clem decided to introduce himself, after all,
he had been just staring for quite a while.
<P align=justify>
"Good morning! I'm sorry to be so forward, but I reckon I owe you an
apology for staring at you."<P align=justify>
"Think nothing of it. I am used to people staring. I let myself go there
a little. Don't worry, I'll be moving on soon. I only need to find
enough work to get me by for a while on the road. Do you know anyone
around here that's hiring? I am pretty good with my hands and I give an
honest day's work."<P align=justify>

"I know the fellow at the feed store on the highway is looking for
someone to lump grain sacks. Interested?" Clem was being coy.
<P align=justify>
"That would be great! I need to work some of this sag off me anyway."
the stranger replied, patting a nonexistent gut.
<P align=justify>
"Come on then. You can ride with me. Name's Clem."
<P align=justify>
"Nice to meet you Clem, my name's Al." The two men shook hands.
<P align=justify>
Clem treated his new hired man to a big breakfast at Daisy's Highway 66
Cafe. Then he walked him over to the feed store and put him to work
loading bags of feed on his straight truck for deliveries. He also
helped the walk in customer's load their own purchases.
<P align=justify>
The Locals gathered in the feedstore, paying no mind to Clem's new man.
They had gossip to share about the squatter down at the trestle pool.
Neither John the Liar or Rockhead could find any sign of the stranger.
His camp looked lived in, but he was no where. Al heard all this of
course and made an effort to introduce himself but he was quickly cut
short by Clem, who wanted to have a little fun at John the Liar's
expense.
<P align=justify>
For more than an hour the Locals debated who the stranger was and what
had become of him. Al kept himself busy, but always in the background
and always within earshot. Every so often Clem would have to give him a
sign to keep his secret, Al wanted to let the men know he was no serial
killer, rapist or escaped convict. But Clem was enjoying this far too
much to let it end. If the conversation would seem to die down, Clem
would fan the flame a little. It kept the debate heated.
<P align=justify>
Finally John the Liar asked Clem right out of the blue who his new man
was. Clem introduced Al around. The Locals sized him up as another
fellow who occasionally worked for Clem, a little worn around the edges,
but a good fellow nonetheless.
<P align=justify>
"What brings you to Rock Creek, Al?" was John's first question.
<P align=justify>
"I was in Viet Nam and promised a friend that if I was ever in the area
I would look him up. His folks have a farm near hear. Maybe you know
them? The McAuley's."
<P align=justify>
"You know Paul McAuley?"
<P align=justify>
"We were in the same unit. I told him after the war I would look him
up."
<P align=justify>
"Paul never came home from the war. MIA. His folks never recovered. But
I'll bet you they'll be tickled pink to meet someone who knew their
son," John suggested hopefully.
<P align=justify>
"I wouldn't want to intrude." With that, Al returned to his work, not
caring to speak anymore on the subject.
<P align=justify>
At Daisy's the next morning, John the Liar corned Clem at the Local's
table.
<P align=justify>
"You sneaky bugger. Why didn't you tell us all Al was the van guy?
Imagine my surprise this morning when I was fishing down at the Trestle
Pool and Al came out of the van." Clem just laughed in reply.
<P align=justify>
Al arrived at work a little early and went right to work. An older
couple drove their Ford pickup in to load it with horse feed. Clem took
their order and hollered at Al in the back to help them load. Al came
out with a bag of pellets slung over his shoulder and carried it right
out to the truck. He heaved it into the back and turned around to find
himself face to face with his mother, who he hadn't laid eyes on in
nearly two decades. Lu looked him right in the eye and fainted dead
away, right into his arms. Louie came running to his wife's side,
fearing the worst. Louie never looked up from his wife to take a good
look at the man whose strong yet gentle arms cradled the woman who had
given his heart more than forty years before. Clem brought water and
soon Lu was coming around, but strangely she wasn't looking into Louie's
eyes. She was staring into her son's. Tears of joy were streaming down
her face, but Louie took them for tears of pain. He searched her
desperately for the injury that was causing them.
<P align=justify>
"Paul. Is that really you?" the question that had been hers to ask for
so many years.
<P align=justify>
"Yes Mama. It's me. I'm home."
<P align=justify>
Louie looked into the stranger's eyes for the first time and realized
his wife was not suffering from delusions. His son was really here,
kneeling on the sidewalk in front of Clem's Feed Store, holding his
mother.
<P align=justify>
"Son? What is...where have....how did you? God damn it's good to see
you!" And tears were streaming down the older McAuley's face too.
<P align=justify>
"Louis! Watch you language!" scolded Lu.
<P align=justify>
It took the three McAuley's twenty minutes of hugging and crying before
they realized a crowd had gathered. By then, Paul explained that he was
trying to figure out how to approach his parent's after twenty years of
being an anonymous vagrant, with a messed up life and screwed up head.
He HAD been a POW for quite awhile, but only after being on his own in
the jungle for
more than two months. He had set up a little camp in an out of the way
location, and he with the other three survivors from the helicopter
crash decided that the war had passed them by, and rather than go
looking for it, they would wait for it to come back. Distant thunder
each day had told them all they needed to know about the war's
continuing existence.
<P align=justify>
The four years in the prison camp had taken quite a toll on Paul. Cooped
up like an animal had caused him to lose a little of his mind. It had
taken him eight years in the VA to get his head right and another eight
years on the road to work up the nerve to come home. Each day away had
made it harder to return. Finally, he found himself stranded in the very
place he had meant to avoid, not wanting to find out that his parent's
had died or had changed their hearts about him.
<P align=justify>
Now he felt such a fool. But he was home.
<P align=justify>
Fittingly, Paul Allen McAuley was given a hero's welcome. In 1995
President Bill Clinton awarded him a Congressional Medal of Honor in the
Rose Garden of the White House for the efforts he gave to save the lives
of the rest of his squad and to keep them alive with his hunting and
trapping skills. Major General Isaac Washington was on hand to apologize
for not letting the McAuley's know their son was still alive. He had
been the Major who had visited so many years before.
<P align=justify>
Clem paid off Paul McAuley before he left the store that day. Paul had
wanted a little money so that he could go home with something, not
destitute and filthy, which is not a fitting way for a mother to see her
son. Clem gave Paul a bit of a cuffing for not being honest with him,
but he allowed that he understood.
<P align=justify>
Paul is still farming the McAuley place, married to a widowed woman with
three small children. Grandma Lu and Grandpa Louie love those
stepchildren like their own. The elders live in the old house, Louie
built the newlyweds a new place on the farm. The McAuley grandkids ride
the bus to school every day, and the new Mrs. McAuley, Susan, prays
every night that her husband was
the last McAuley son to ever leave Rock Creek to fight on foreign
shores. Louie and Lu are regulars again at the VFW. Having a son come
home with such journey behind him and have him become a Medal of Honor
winner too is all they need to hold their heads high again.
<P align=justify>
Paul takes his daughter and two sons fishing with him every chance he
gets. The boys are learning to cast and tie flies, and to them their new
dad is just a super guy. Paul's homecoming is complete.
