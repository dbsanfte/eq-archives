<P>Todd Sloan sat at the airport lounge wearing a beige safari hat watching planes landing and taking off, and then looked down at the empty glass sitting on the mahogany bar in front of him, motioning for the bartender to come and refill it. When the bartender arrived with his patented, professional smile intact, Sloan tried to make a joke.
</P>    <P>"Another Bloody Mary, please, this celery stalk looks ridiculous sitting in an empty glass."
</P>

<P>"The stalk is usually eaten by now, sir."</P>
 <P>   "I was only trying to make a small joke," he countered.</P>
   <P> "Very small, sir," the young man replied walking away.</P>
    <P>"You're being rather flip with me."</P>
<P>    "I know," he called back over his shoulder.</P>
    <P>"Bartenders, you've got to love them or hate them," he heard a voice say.</P>
<P>When Sloan turned, he saw the seat two away from him was occupied now by a man in a dark brown suit carrying a briefcase, apparently a typical business traveler stopping for a libation between flights. For Todd Sloan, he seemed someone he could finally have a conversation with that would not be rude or cut him off before he was finished. </P>
<P>
    It was something that was happening too often these days so he immediately slid over until he was next to the man.
</P>
<P>"Hi, Todd Sloan is the name," he said extending his hand.</P>
<P>    "Kip Knoll," the man replied shaking Sloan's hand. "What time does your flight leave?"</P>
   <P> "Oh, I'm not going anywhere, I'm waiting for a flight to come in. My two sons are arriving from California for a visit, it's my time of the year with them again."
</P>   <P> "Your time?" he said, a questioning tone in his voice.</P>
   <P> "Annual visitation, I'm divorced."</P>
   <P> "Oh, you have children that young?" asked Knoll. </P>
 
   <P> "Sure," he replied affably. "What do you do for a living, I'm an actor when they give me work?"
</P>   <P> "Sales, computer software, things like that, I'm on a business trip now," he said, as the bartender returned with Sloan's drink. "So, what have you acted in, anything I might have seen?"
</P>

   <P>"Well, there was Dog Day Afternoon, I was in the crowd outside the bank. My big scene was when Al Pacino begins yelling Attica, Attica, I begin the chant that gets the crowd going along with him."
</P>    <P>"Really, what kind of guy is Pacino?"</P>
    <P>"I don't know, really."</P>
    
   <P> "How can you make a movie with the man and not know what he's like?"</P>



<P>"Like I said, I was in a crowd scene outside the bank, I wasn't his co-star. Al Pacino wouldn't know me if I had been sitting here with him all afternoon."
</P>   <P> "That's pretty dim," the man said with a shrug of indifference.</P>
   <P> "What do you mean by dim?" asked Sloan with annoyance.</P>
   <P> "To be perfectly blunt, old man, I think your full of it. Anyone could say they were in a crowd scene across the street from the bank when they were filming Dog Day Afternoon."
</P>
<P>"Then go see it and tell me that's not me chanting after Pacino yells Attica."</P>
  <P>  "Go see it, you mean go rent it don't you?" </P>
<P>    A strange look of bewilderment appeared on Sloan's face but Knoll elected to move on.</P> 
<P>    "Did you appear in anything else I might recognize you from?"</P>
    <P>"Only Three Days of the Condor with Robert Redford, I'm behind him in the last scene of the movie sitting on his shoulder actually, it leaves you with the impression I might be the next assassin who will try and kill him."
</P>
<P>Knoll appeared to be thinking for a moment, and then spoke.</P> 
<P>    "In a police uniform?"</P>
<P>    "Yes, that's me," Sloan replied, finally glad someone recognized him.</P>
    <P>"Okay, that one I remember but it's a little difficult to be sure it's you, I mean from then and now."
</P>    <P>The bewildered look returned. "What do you mean by that?"</P>
    <P>"I mean, well, you're older now and you had a police cap on so it's hard to distinguish features in a scene like that."
</P>    <P>"Look, all I've changed about my appearance is I shaved off the moustache I had then. I would think you'd say I looked younger, not older."
</P>
<P>Kip Knoll began feeling agitation talking to Sloan so he looked up at a clock and was relieved to see it was time for his flight. He downed the remainder of his drink and hurried off after making a hasty goodbye, telling Sloan it had been nice talking to him, though he did not voice that some of his statements baffled him somewhat. </P>
<P>Sloan thanked him politely but sensed Knoll's agitation, which he attributed to the fact he had been consuming his drinks too rapidly and they had come on to strong for his dialogue with a stranger to be comfortable. Then he looked at his watch and realized it was time to meet his boys' flight. His time of year with them only came around once each cycle, and he did not want to ruin it by appearing to them to be drunk when they arrived.</P>
<BR>
<P>Sloan had been through enough of a ringer when he and his wife Moiré had been going through their divorce, they throwing accusations back and forth at one another while Todd jr. and Sebastian were being torn apart emotionally from their conflict. It made him feel as if he was being forced to prove his love and sincere interest in their upbringing repeatedly, far above the normal scrutiny children routinely gave their parents during turbulent times such as these. </P>
<P>    Nevertheless, Sloan had always felt that when they were truly old enough to understand, a grudging sort of respect would replace all the animosity that had nurtured within them because when push came to shove, he had stayed the course of truth and love as any father should. For their sake, he had ended his verbal combat with Moira and had borne the indignities he was then subjected to without protest, if that did not prove a father's selfless love nothing would, he reasoned.</P>
<P>    When Sloan arrived, he saw his sons' plane just taxiing up to the arrival gate, and a feeling of elation was born within and swept over his being, filling him with a joy unique to this time of year. After a few minutes, the debarkation door opened and the people began pouring through the narrow doorway, their happy expressions reflecting the expressions on the faces of the people greeting them. </P>
<P>
    However, as the stream of people began to thin out, Sloan still had not gotten a glimpse of either Todd jr. or Sebastian among the crowd and his elation quickly were replaced by panic. He began wondering if Moira had kept them in California to cause him some further emotional stress, driving him closer and closer to the edge of sanity. Until finally he reached the precipice and was pitched into the bottomless void the deranged mind often dwells in, the place where even the thinnest shaft of light does not penetrate to give hope salvation could be at hand.
</P>	
<P>After another few moments of frustration, Sloan rushed to a nearby telephone and dialed Moiré's number collect because he did not have any change with him, but as it rang anger now blended with worry and fear that something might have happened to them. </P>	
<P>His mind raced with a thousand thoughts trying to decide what to say first and in what tone. Should he take an angry tact that they had not been on the flight or a concerned one they might be ill? Be on the offense or the defense when dealing with Moiré, it was always cause to ponder. Finally, the telephone was answered and he heard the operator's voice.</P>	
    <P>"Collect call for anyone from Todd Sloan."</P>
    <P>"Who?" asked a female voice that was not familiar to him.</P>
<P>    "Todd Sloan," repeated the operator.</P>
<BR>

    <P>"I'm sorry, operator, no one here knows anyone by that name, it must be a wrong number," said a female voice as she hung up.
</P>   <P> "Operator, operator, make that call for Moiré Sloan," he said desperately.</P>
   <P> "I'm sorry, sir, the party hung up, would you like to try another number?" asked the operator.
</P>   <P> "No, that's the number try it again, please."</P>
    <P>"I'm sorry, the party has already stated it's a wrong number and our policy is not to harass people with errant calls," the operator told him in a professional monotone. "If you wish to try another number I will dial it for you."
</P>
<P>"Bitch!" he screamed in angry frustration at the operator. </P>
    <P>Then he slammed the telephone back on the cradle, the echo reverberating painfully through his ears and tormenting his mind until finally tears began to well from his eyes that escalated into deep sobs. 
	</P>
<P>    The ones that come directly from the heart born from loneliness and fueled by despair, until like a plague it spread to every corner of his psyche, filling him with a deep sense of regret for opportunities missed and chances for happiness lost. He stood there a few moments more feeling somewhat embarrassed now from the glances his shouting at the operator had garnered from the few remaining people in the terminal. </P>	
<BR>
<P>    Then he turned to go to find out whether his sons had been listed as passengers on the flight. However, as he began to walk, the first pain hit his chest with the force of a sledgehammer, knocking him backward into the wall and he began to gag, gripping his chest with one hand while the other clutched frantically at his throat. His jaw moved up and down trying to speak, his body beginning to gyrate wildly in its ritualistic dance toward death, the gaping mouth gasping for the breath that would continue his life but was refusing to come. </P>	
<P>
    Finally, unable to stand erect any longer, Sloan slid down the wall until he was in a sitting position, his eyes popped grotesquely from their sockets searching the area for anyone who could bring him the gift of life before it was too late, before the dreams and aspirations of a life together with his sons was gone too. 
</P>	
<P>But down deep beneath the heart that was exploding in his chest, Sloan realized no one on earth could save him now so he resigned himself to the fate that was coming closer with each escaping breath, and as his eyes began to close, he allowed his body to surrender to the approaching peace. As the eyes of Todd Sloan stared vacantly up at the Emergency Medical Technician, he began closing them for the last time. Life had departed him, leaving only the physical remains to be interred. </P>	
<BR>
<P>Nearby, a woman traveler who had witnessed the garish spectacle of a man's journey into eternity stood watching as the final preparations for his removal from the airport were being made. She walked up to the technician and touched him lightly on the shoulder.</P>	
    <P>"Excuse me, did you know this man?" she asked.</P>
    <P>"Yeah, Todd Sloan was his name, a local harmless psycho."</P>
    <P>"A psycho!" the woman exclaimed. "How do you mean?"</P>
    <P>"Well, I don't want to seem harsh, but that's the term I use to describe a man who came to the airport every day for twenty-five years to meet his sons' plane."
  </P>  <P>"I don't understand."</P>
<P>"Twenty-five years ago, he came here to meet their plane only to find out it had crashed and all aboard had been killed."
</P>    <P>"No wonder he went out of his mind."</P>
<P>"That's not all, he found out his wife Moiré was also aboard, it seems she had decided to give their marriage another try and was coming east to surprise him, he was surprised alright. Well, ever since that time Sloan used to come here daily to meet the plane. People felt sorry for him at first, but after a while when the impact of the tragedy had passed, people around here began to get annoyed by his presence. Hence, the term psycho was attached to his persona, though it certainly does not fit for what he went through."</P>
<P>"No, it doesn't," agreed the woman. "Human tragedy is what fits, but there is one positive aspect to this."</P>
    <P>    "What's that, Ma'am?"</P>
<P>    "Was Mr. Sloan a religious man?"</P>
<P>    The E.M.T. pondered her question a moment, and then replied. </P>
<P>    "Yes, I believe he was, I'm sure I heard him speak about faith on occasion."</P>
   <P> "Then he's at peace with that now."</P>
   <P> "How do you mean?"</P>
<P>    "His plane has finally landed."</P>
