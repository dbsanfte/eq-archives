	 <P>Weight gain has nothing to do with such common-but-useless
 explanations as a "weak will" or "bad genes" or a "flawed
 modern society".
</P>
                  <BR><hr><BR>

<P>Most people rightly fear weight gain because it happens so
easily, is so hard to correct, and has such devastating effects
on their self-esteem, social standing, energy level, and health.</P>

<P>But most disturbing of all is that seemingly no one - including
scientists - knows why people gain their excess weight or why
it's so hard to get rid of.</P>

<P>Together, this popular fear and scientific ignorance have
created an information vacuum that sucks in all sorts of
painful, foolish, and destructive "answers" to the question:
"Why am I getting so fat?"</P>

<P>In this article we'll discuss a much better explanation for
weight gain and how you can reverse it, but first let's dispose
of some of the useless stuff.</P>

<P>To begin, we will state unequivocally that even if you have been
overweight for years, you shouldn't believe this means you must
have some physical, mental, or moral defect - because you don't.</P>

<P>Specifically:</P>

<P>You don't "just have a weak will".</P>

<P>You are not "lazy".
</P>
<P>You are not "neurotic".</P>

<P>You are not eating because you need "a substitute for love", or
because "your fat protects you from the world", or because of
any other irrational compulsion to associate unrelated things.</P>

<P>Furthermore:</P>

<P>You are not "metabolically defective".</P>

<P>Your genes are no worse than anyone else's.</P>

<P>You don't have a maladjusted "set point" for fat.</P>

<P>Useless explanations like these continually fail to produce
useful answers to the problem of weight gain because they have
nothing whatever to do with the actual causes of weight gain.</P>

<P>Fortunately, we now have a much better way to understand why
people gain excess weight and how they can lose it again.</P>

<P>Here's what really happens:</P>

<P>You get fat because you regularly eat too much food energy -
Calories.</P>

<P>But you eat too many Calories because you are chronically hungry
for something else you need from food and aren't getting enough
of.</P>
<P>
You are chronically hungry because your body is chronically low
on one (or more) of the vital nutrients that you must get from
food in order to be healthy. Food energy (Calories) is one of
those vital nutrients, but it's never the one you are low on -
as you can see in any mirror.</P>

<P>Your hunger makes you eat food - which always has Calories - but
this food often doesn't have much of the thing you really are
low on.</P>

<P>So you quickly run low on that thing again and quickly get
hungry again - too soon.</P>

<P>Then you eat more food with more Calories - but again not much
of what really made you hungry.</P>

<P>You repeat this sequence over and over - usually without
realizing it - for weeks, months, and years.</P>

<P>Your body thriftily stores the excess Calories and you get fat.</P>

<P>Looked at from this point of view, the problem of "overweight"
becomes both easy to understand and easy to solve.</P>

<P>To solve it, you do exactly the opposite of what made you fat.
You learn to deliberately eat things that give your body enough
of all of the nutrients it needs - EXCEPT for the Calories.</P>

<P>This means that you still eat to deliberately make yourself
run low on Calories. But much more importantly, you also
eat to deliberately make sure you never run low on anything
else. Both are necessary and neither by itself is sufficient.</P>

<P>When you can successfully do both, your body simply pulls its
energy needs out of its ample fat stores - which themselves
won't run low enough to make you hungry for a long time. And
when they finally do - by definition you're thin again! And
that's the whole point of the effort, isn't it?</P>

<P>It's not hard to learn how much of what foods and supplements
you should eat in order to both eliminate hunger and maintain a
constant Calorie deficit. It requires some reading and
understanding, but there's no longer a deep theoretical mystery
here.</P>

<P>And it's not rocket science to put this method into effect
either. It takes some time, attention, and practice - but so did
learning to drive a car. And learning the right way to eat is no
more difficult than learning the right way to drive.</P>

<P>In my next article, we'll begin to discuss some of the food
strategies that you can use to manage nutrition and lose weight
successfully by this method.</P>
