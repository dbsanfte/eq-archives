<img src="larryjaffe.jpg">
Larry Jaffe began writing at the age of 11 when he realized the air was made of letters, which he could breathe in and breathe out words. Says Jaffe, "Life is a poem and I write it." He is committed to returning poetry to the people and speaks strongly about the role of poetry and poets in today's society.
<P>From the sensually romantic to humor to social commentary, Jaffe impacts audiences with a rich emotional range, masterfully crafted. His poetry appears in numerous anthologies, magazines, and on the internet where he has pioneered web sites that feature poetry of others as well as his own. His recent books include Unprotected Poetry, Hate's Not Natural, Winter Rose, and Jewish Soul Food.
<P>At the Moondog Cafe in Hollywood, Larry hosts PoeticLicense, rated one of the hottest, high-energy venues in Southern California Cal. He strives to provide a safe haven for poets to bring their works alive. He has also created PoeticLicenseNEWS, an online newsletter, featuring an international poet's forum, poetry news bulletin board, an open mike, and local poetic news for So. Cal.
Jaffe has conducted featured readings throughout the country, including Las Vegas, and three Austin tours, where he has read during the Austin International Poetry Festival, and at such venues as Waterloo Ice House, and Heritage House.  In his SoCal home base, Larry has featured at the Comedy Store, Borders Books, Celebrity Centre, the Onyx, Beyond Baroque, Magic Johnson's Starbucks and many others. He has just completed a five state tour
with features at such venues as Jus Gumbo in Fairhope, Ala, Myth.com in Washington, D.C., the Iota Poetry Series in Arlington Va., 13 Bar Lounge in NYC, Cantab Lounge in Boston and Prodigal Son Coffeehouse in Hyanis.<BR><BR> </FONT>

Annie James lives on the Somerset levels in the West of England in a converted dairy barn surrounded by fields and bound on the South by
the River Sheppey and to the north by a road that, in living memory, was only a cart track.
 <BR>
Before being diagnosed with narcolepsy she ran her own successful managment consultancy company and in the last year that she worked
trained nearly 500 engineers in change management and leadership. Little did she know how much she would have to put those "change
management theories" into practice herself.
 <BR>
Since then her life has been chaotic and sometimes catastophic as a consequence of confusing diagnoses and various hard-hitting
neurological treatments, none of which have worked. 
<BR> 
Unwilling to accept a life of helpless disability she bought a computer and covered it with a tablecloth for about a year. Then she struggled
with getting to grips with it for about another year - outraged that the system she had invested in and had yet to use was completely out of
date by then - and began writing.
<BR> 
"Barking at the Apple in the River" is her first work. The title came to her one day when, sat with a demon focus writing on her on the
computer, she was finding it increasingly difficult to ignore the incessant barking of her otherwise beloved dog Bridget. She did not want to
break her concentration to see what was wrong but in the end she snapped. 
<BR> 
The black border-collie/labrador cross was stood at the end of the garden besides herself with anger and frustration -"barking at the apple in
the river." It was caught, enticingly in a reed bed. She could see what she wanted and she wanted it more than anything else. She had whipped
herself into a frenzy of frustration and it was not making one jot of difference. There was no way that she could reach it. The bank was too
steep, the water was too high, the distance to it was too far...
<BR> 
When her owner saw the situation she collapsed with laughter, forgetting completely her own frusration. The dog neither appreciated this nor
did she think it funny. 
<BR> 
How many times, she thought to herself, had she been in that situation? How many times?

"Ches January lives in London but other than that most aspects of her
                 life are in a constant state of flux.  Various stories have made their way to  various print and internet compilations but her novels have never really made  their way off the hard-drive.  As well as a passion for writing, she studies   philosophy, works with computers, goes nightclubbing with weirdoes, watches  too much TV and does the odd bit of skiing."
