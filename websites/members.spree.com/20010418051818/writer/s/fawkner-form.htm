	<P>I received an email the other day from an online friend alerting me 
to the fact that someone had copied one of the pages of my 
website and was using it, virtually verbatim, at theirs. It was my 
first personal experience of copyright infringement. How flattering, 
I thought! I imagine though that when it happens a few more 
times it will begin feeling decidedly less flattering and decidedly 
more irritating. We ARE talking about theft, after all. So, that 
got me thinking about how to handle such situations. And THAT 
got me thinking about copyright law and, in particular, how it 
impacts on those of us running online businesses. After all, 
this is our livelihood we’re talking about.</P>
<P>
In this article, I’m going to share the results of my research with 
you. Because we’re dealing with a technical legal subject here, 
I want to preface this article with a strong disclaimer that I am 
NOT giving you legal advice in this article. This is simply the 
result of my own research and you use or ignore the information 
I’ve included here at your peril. I neither assume nor accept any 
responsibility for what you do with this information. Also, this 
article discusses United States copyright law. If you live outside 
the United States, check your local copyright laws. Mind you, 
if you're running an online business, because of the international 
nature of the medium, the United States copyright laws are 
relevant to you.</P>

<P>With that said, let’s get to it. We’ll look first of all at what 
copyright is, what it does, what can and can’t be copyrighted and 
who’s entitled to it. Then we move on to look at how to protect 
the copyright in your own work before, finally, dealing with how to 
go about using others’ work without infringing their copyright.</P>

<P><U>COPYRIGHT DEFINED</U></P>

<P>In a nutshell, copyright is legal protection for the authors of original 
literary, dramatic, musical, artistic and intellectual works. 
Copyright protects both published and unpublished works. Only 
the copyright owner has the right to reproduce, sell, distribute and 
perform the work publicly or to authorize others to do so.</P>

<P><U>THE COPYRIGHT OWNER</U></P>

<P>Generally, only the author of the work can claim copyright to it. </P>

<P>There are a couple of relevant exceptions, however. Firstly, if the 
work is “work made for hire”, the employer and not the employee 
is the “author”. Work made for hire is work prepared by an 
employee within the scope of his or her employment (as is work 
prepared by an independent contractor provided that the contractor 
has signed an agreement acknowledging and agreeing that the 
work shall be work made for hire). So, if you’re a website 
designer employed by a design company, the copyright in your 
work belongs to your employer, not to you. Your employer is 
the author of your work.</P>

<P><U>WHAT CAN BE COPYRIGHTED?</U></P>

<P>Copyright attaches to original works fixed in a tangible form of 
expression. So, for example, a dance routine created by a 
choreographer and recorded in writing can be copyrighted 
because the recording in writing fixes the work in a tangible 
form of expression. Were the choreographer not to record the 
routine, however (whether in writing, on videotape or some other 
tangible form of expression), and instead just kept the routine 
in his or her head, the routine would not be able to be 
copyrighted because the routine has not been fixed in a 
tangible form of expression.</P>
<P>
<U>WHAT CAN’T BE COPYRIGHTED?</U></P>
<P>
In addition to works not fixed in a tangible form of expression, 
other types of works that can’t be copyrighted are titles, names, 
short phrases, slogans and the like (trademark protection may 
be available though); ideas (copyright protects only the tangible 
expression of the idea, not the idea itself); procedures, methods, 
systems, processes, concepts, principles etc.; and works 
consisting entirely of information that is common property and 
containing no original authorship such as calendars and facts 
of the world.</P>

<P><U>COPYRIGHTING YOUR WOR</U>K</P>

<P>Perhaps the most widely misunderstood aspect of copyright 
law is that it does not require registration or publication to come 
into existence. Copyright attaches automatically once a work 
capable of being copyrighted is “created”. “Created” in this 
context means when the work is fixed in a tangible form of 
expression for the first time.</P>
<P>Under the copyright legislation, publication occurs when 
copies are distributed to the public by way of sale, other transfer 
of ownership, rental, lease or lending. Note that a mere public 
performance or display of work does not, of itself, constitute 
publication. So, just because you have a website available for 
all the world to see, this does not mean that your website content 
has been “published” for the purposes of copyright law. On the 
other hand, though, just because it hasn’t been published, 
doesn’t mean that it doesn’t enjoy copyright protection!</P>
<P>As you can see from the definition of “publication”, creating and 
making an e-book (for example) available for sale from your site 
amounts to publishing in the copyright sense. Once something 
is published, it is mandatory to deposit two copies in the 
Copyright Office within three months of publication in the United 
States for use in the Library of Congress. If you fail to do so, 
you may be liable for a fine of $250. Failure to deposit does 
NOT, however, affect whether your work has copyright protection.</P> 
<P>
If you continue to fail to deposit your work after being notified to 
do so, the fine increases to $2,500. Although there are certain 
exceptions to the mandatory deposit rule, none of them apply to 
our e-book example. For a full list of exceptions, see section 
202.19(c) of the copyright legislation (37 CFR Ch. II). It’s 
available online at the United States Copyright Office at 
http://www.loc.gov/copyright/title37/ . So, if you’re selling an 
e-book from your site, a set of “how to” reports, or whatever, 
and you’re the copyright owner, you need to deposit two copies 
with the Copyright Office.</P>

<P>As we have already seen, copyright springs into existence 
automatically upon creation of work that is capable of being 
copyrighted. This is known as common law copyright. In 
addition to common law copyright, the copyright legislation 
provides for statutory registration. There are several advantages 
to registering your copyright. Firstly, it constitutes a public 
record of your claim to copyright in the subject work. Secondly, 
registration is a prerequisite to an entitlement to sue for an 
infringement of your copyright (if the works are of U.S. origin). </P>

<P>In other words, if your copyright isn’t registered, you can’t sue if 
someone uses your work without permission. Thirdly, if you 
register your copyright within three months after publication or 
prior to infringement, you’ll be able to seek statutory damages 
and attorneys’ fees if you bring legal proceedings for infringement. 
Otherwise, your damages are restricted to actual damages or 
an account of profits generated by the infringer as a result of the 
infringement. In many instances of copyright infringement, you 
simply will not be able to point to a financial loss in a specific 
amount. After all, if someone copies one of your content 
webpages but you don’t suffer a financial loss and they don’t 
obtain an obvious financial advantage, what’s your loss or their 
gain in financial terms? Registration allows you to recover 
monetary damages in such circumstances. Fourthly, 
registration allows the copyright owner to record registration 
with the US Customs Service for protection against the 
importation of infringing copies of your work.</P>
<P>
For detailed information about how to go about registering your 
copyright, visit the United States Copyright Office at 
http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/ .
</P>
<P><U>ROLE OF THE COPYRIGHT NOTICE</U></P>

<P>Although a formal copyright notice is not required, it can be 
useful. Firstly, it puts the reader or viewer of your work on 
notice that copyright does exist in the work and that alone may 
make would-be thieves at least think twice before stealing your 
work. Secondly, if a copyright notice appeared on work in which 
your copyright was infringed, then (subject to certain exceptions 
- see s. 504(c)(2) of the copyright legislation available at the 
United States Copyright Office website at 
http://www.loc.gov/copyright/title17/92chap5.html ) the offender 
can’t claim innocent infringement in mitigation of damages.</P> 

<P>Thirdly, it makes it easier for someone to track you down and 
ask for permission to use your work!
The form of the copyright notice for published work is:</P>
<pre>
© 2000 Jane Smith 
or 
Copyright 2000 Jane Smith 
or 
Copr. 2000 Jane Smith.
For unpublished work, the notice should read:
Unpublished work © 2000 Jane Smith
</pre>
<P><U>DURATION OF COPYRIGHT PROTECTION</U></P>

<P>For work created after January 1, 1978, the work is automatically 
protected from creation until 70 years after the death of the author. 
In the case of joint works, the copyright extends to 70 years after 
the death of the surviving author. In the case of works made for 
hire and anonymous/pseudonymous works, copyright endures for 
95 years from publication or 120 years from creation, whichever is 
the earlier.</P>

<P><U>TRANSFERRING COPYRIGHT</U></P>

<P>Copyright is a personal property right and can therefore be 
transferred. A transfer of an exclusive right will not be valid, however, 
unless it's in writing and signed by the copyright owner or his/her 
authorized agent. A transfer of a non-exclusive right need not be in 
writing.</P>

<P>As copyright is a personal property right, it can be bequeathed by 
will or pass by operation of the law governing intestate succession 
(the rules that govern if someone dies without leaving a will).</P>

<P><U>USING OTHERS’ WORK</U></P>

<P>So much for protecting the copyright in your own work. What are 
the limits of how you can use the work of others without infringing 
*their* copyright?</P>
<P>
In short, unless “fair use” applies (discussed below) you will violate 
the copyright owner’s copyright if you use all or any part of their 
work (either as is or with trivial changes) in your work without prior 
permission.</P>
<P>
It is not an infringement of copyright, however, to use short 
quotations from a work for the purposes of criticism, comment, 
teaching, scholarship or research. Any quotations used must 
clearly identify the name of the author and the source of the 
quotation. Just use the same kinds of citations you used in your 
college papers e.g. “ “this is an example of how to cite a quotation” 
(Doe, J., “The Work That Is Being Quoted From”, 1988, page 23)” or 
some other generally accepted form of citation. Note, however, 
that if your use is not fair use, then merely giving credit to the 
author of the work won’t protect you.</P>
<P>
As for what constitutes “fair use”, this is one of those gray areas 
that depends on all the circumstances. In general, the factors to 
be considered include the purpose and character of the use, 
including whether it is of a commercial or non-profit nature (if you 
stand to make a profit on the use, the less likely it is that your 
use will be considered “fair use”); the amount and substantiality 
of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole 
and the effect of the use upon the potential market for and value 
of the copyrighted work. For example, if you use a tiny part of a 
work but that part was, until you used it, confidential information 
taken from a book that was shortly to be published, that may not 
be “fair use” because you have effectively undermined the potential 
market for and value of the book.</P>

<P>As a rough guide, bear the following rules of thumb in mind: first, 
if you’re creating something new rather than merely copying 
someone else’s work, your chances of falling within the “fair use” 
defense are relatively better; second, don’t compete with your 
source; and third, less is more. The more you take, the less “fair” 
your use.</P>

<P><U>FOR WEBMASTER</U>S</P>

<P>Although the above issues relate equally to the online world as 
they do offline, there are some additional issues that webmasters 
need to think about in the copyright arena.
Firstly, just because you can download something for free doesn’t, 
of itself, mean you can redistribute it freely. Clip art is a good 
example. There are numerous sites that offer free clip art. These 
sites allow you to download some of their clip art images free of 
charge. You can use these images for your own purposes in 
developing your webpages, for example, but just because they’re 
free does NOT mean you can then turn around and make the 
images available to someone else for free or otherwise. Under 
these sorts of download arrangements, you’re given a restricted 
license only. The same goes for free e-books. Check whether 
the author of the e-book has granted permission for it to be freely 
distributed. Most do. Usually you’ll find some reference to 
further dissemination of the work on the cover or the first page of 
the e-book.</P>

<P>Secondly, consider not deep linking. Deep linking occurs when 
you link to another site from your site but, instead of linking to 
the home page of the other site, you link to a page within the site. 
</P>
<P>Some webmasters object to this because it can confuse the site 
visitor about exactly whose site it is that they’ve come to. On the 
other hand, linking to a home page can be inconvenient for the 
site visitor. I know of one ezine publisher, for example, who 
frequently includes links to articles written by other people in her 
ezine. It irks her when people just give their home page URL rather 
than the URL of the article itself. She reasons, why should her 
readers have to go hunting for the article? If they’re impressed 
with the writing, they’ll naturally want to stop and look around the 
site. Clearly there are both pros and cons of deep linking. Make 
up your own mind.</P>

<P>Finally, a word about frames. If you use frames on your website 
so you can display content from other websites without it being 
obvious to the site visitor that they’ve gone to someone else’s site, 
this very fact may land you in trouble. If your actions lead the 
site visitor thinks the content they’re viewing belongs to your site, 
you’ve probably just contravened the copyright of the owner of the 
site you’ve linked to with your frame!</P>

<P>Registering your copyright is the first step to protecting the 
benefits of your hard work and endeavor. There are, unfortunately, 
plenty of people online today who have somehow got the idea 
that everything online is free and up for grabs. As a result, it’s 
more likely than not that one day you will have to grapple with the 
unpleasant reality that someone has stolen your work. Depending 
on the nature and extent of the infringement, you may be forced 
to take legal action. If you haven’t registered your copyright you 
won’t be able to do that. But more importantly, your work has 
value. You’ve made an investment in terms of your time, effort 
and talent. You wouldn’t leave your front door open for thieves to 
walk in and steal your stereo. You worked hard for the assets 
you have accumulated. So it is with your creative works. They 
are as much assets as anything else you own. So get your 
copyright registered and close the front door to the thieves who 
would help themselves to what you have worked so hard to create.
