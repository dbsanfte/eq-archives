"I could write a book.  I have a great idea for one."  I hear this every time I meet someone.  It is nearly a constant thing now.  Invariably, whenever I am getting past the small talk of the obligatory introductory ritual of our culture, the following conversation takes place:
<P align=justify>This other person says, "Blah-blah-blah.  So that's what I do.  What do you do?"
<P align=justify>"Well, I'm a consultant but I'm also an editor and a writer," I answer.
<P align=justify>"Oh really?  What do you write?"
<P align=justify>At this point I usually list my most recent credits.  It is almost a given that since this person has not had the will to write this book that has been locked away inside his head for all this time that this person is also not a reader and is therefore unfamiliar with my work.  Nevertheless, to demure would be impolite, so I carry on the ritual.
<P align=justify>"Cool!"  They enthuse, which correctly translated means they have not read anything recently.  Then I wait for it and after very few seconds my patience is rewarded.  "I could write a book.  I have a great idea for one."
<P align=justify>By now, I have developed my answer.  I listen to their idea.  I ask them how long they have had the idea.  Then I say, "Wow.  That is a good idea.  If I had that idea as long as you have, I would have written the book by now.  In fact, it would have already been published by now.  Is there a reason that you don't write it?"
<P align=justify>"Well," they say in that I-am-so full-of-malarkey tone of voice.  "I don't really have the time, you know."  
<P align=justify>I notice they never say, "Well, I don't know how to write.  I have neither the talent nor the skill nor the burning desire to write it."
<P align=justify>I answer, "No time is it?  But you had time to tell me about it."
<P align=justify>Sometimes, they actually even come to the conclusion that I reached a long time ago.  The answer to the question of why they have not yet written this future bestseller is simple.
<P align=justify>They are not writers.
<P align=justify>What is the point of all this you ask?  The point is simple.  Having an idea does not mean you are a writer.  Being a writer means you actually write down the idea in its entirety from beginning to end.
Someone who has an idea for a story, even if it is a good idea for a story, but does not write it down from beginning to end, is not a writer.  Someone who has an idea for a story and writes it down from beginning to end but cannot write that idea down in a way that is interesting and/or marketable, is still a writer.  They are just a bad writer.
<P align=justify>The point here is, writers write because they cannot do anything else.  They have an idea in their head that insists on having a voice.  There is no way they can just keep it inside their head and ignore it, until one day years later they actually meet someone who is a writer and get a chance to say, "I could write a book.  I have a great idea for one."
<P align=justify>Now that we know the difference between someone who is a writer and someone who is not a writer, let us explore the different types of writers.  Basically, there are good writers and bad writers.
We all know the good writers.  Some of them are out of print now and some of them occasionally climb to the top of the bestseller list.  Some of them were force fed to us in High School.  Some of them we have never heard of but cannot wait to read.
<P align=justify>We all know the bad writers, too.  A lot of them have had long lasting and somewhat lucrative careers writing scripts for Hollywood.  Unfortunately, most of them do not know they are bad writers, will never take an honest critique of their work, and will never understand why they keep getting rejection letters.
What are the characteristics of a good writer?  Good writers are never satisfied with their work.  Good writers treat writing as their profession and a good writer writes.  Good writers constantly hone their craft and improve their writing skills.  Good writers are not limited by the rules governing the written word.  Good writers value criticism.  Good writers revise and polish their work.  Good writers know the industry of their profession.  Good writers know when to stop writing.  Good writers are dreamers and a realists.  Good writers are their own biggest fan and their own worst critic.  Good writers do intensive research.  Good writers give credit where credit is due.  Good writers write because they cannot help themselves.
<P align=justify>What are the characteristics of a bad writer?  A bad writer does not write with precision and is often satisfied with sloppy work.  Bad writers are defensive about criticism of their work.  Bad writers seldom revise or polish their work.  Bad writers have little idea how the industry of their profession works.  A bad writer stops writing too soon or too late.  A bad writer is a dreamer.  Bad writers are their own biggest fan.  A bad writer never does research.  A bad writer never gives credit where credit is due.  A bad writer writes for recognition or fame.
<P align=justify>While these traits may sound vague, they nevertheless hold true if we take a closer look at them. Every time good writers read their own work, they see something they could have done better.  It is much like artists who look at their paintings, seeing all of the flaws that only they can see jumping off the canvas.  A good writer is never satisfied with their work.
<P align=justify>Good writers treat writing as their profession and a good writer writes.  The one tenet that separates a writer from anyone else is that a writer writes.  Some writers live by very strict personally imposed rules that are consistent with their level of self discipline.  For example, one writer I know writes a minimum of 1,000 words each day or for one hour each day, whichever happens last.  Some writers spend every morning on the bus or train and then all weekend making notes in longhand.  Some writers martial their time between writing and revising based on very strict but regular schedules.  Some writers write a chapter each week in whatever "spare," time they encounter.  Whatever system of time management that they use to allow them the proper writing environment, without exception all of them write.  They produce written words consistently.
Good writers constantly hone their craft and improve their writing skills.  If grammar, spelling, punctuation, gender specific point of view, description, or dialogue challenge them, they strive to overcome these challenges by writing exercises.  These are the tools of the trade.  A good writer approaches these tools in the same way that a sculptor takes his hammer and various chisels to hand.  A good writer applies these tools with the same precision and tender hand that a painter blends pigment to produce just the right hue and applies just the right brushstroke in just the right place on the canvas.
<P align=justify>A good writer is not limited by the rules governing the written word.  Where a bad writer will say that such things as grammar, punctuation, spelling, and format are restrictive, a good writer will see them as challenges to their creativity.  Think of this.  There are only twenty-six letters that form the English alphabet and those same twenty-six letters form every single word in it.  If we were not bound by those "rules," we would write sentences like this.  "Plqa zokmw sxijned cuhbr fvygt."   The preceding line contains all of those same twenty-six letters, too, right?  A good writer uses proper punctuation, proper grammar, and proper spelling and still creates art.
<P align=justify>A good writer values criticism.  Good writers already see most of what they consider to be flaws in their work and actually find the honest advice offered in a serious critique priceless.  Human beings learn to improve by trial and error.  If you required brain surgery, I doubt you would choose to let a high school student with no experience perform the operation when a surgeon with twelve years of experience was close by.  If you were building a house, I doubt you would let a neighbor who read a book about laying brick lay your foundation when a contractor with eight years of experience offered the service at a reasonable rate.  Good writers have the humility to realize that their work is good but not great.  If a reader sees what, in their opinion, is a mistake in the work, a good writer will spend a sleepless night swilling coffee if necessary in an attempt to correct it.
Good writers revise and polish their work.  A good writer will not leave off a closing quotation mark.  Good writers never leave a spelling error or a typographical error intact in their manuscript.  A good writer will eliminate redundancy, wipe out contractions in the narrative, never begin a narrative sentence with a conjunction, and stuff their work chock full of active verbs.  Once good writers are finished with their first revision, they will revise it over and over and over again.
<P align=justify>Good writers know the industry of their profession.  A good writer knows industry terms such as residuals, editor, agent, publisher, house, seller, reseller, rights, and their significance.  A good writer attends conferences and seminars and builds a network of contacts in the industry.
<P align=justify>A good writer knows when to stop writing.  Good writers know when there are areas of their work that need more fleshing out.  They can see when their description could be better, when their narrative needs more fluid exposition, and when they need to better flesh out a character or plot line.  A good writer knows not to stop writing too soon.  More importantly, good writers realize that their work will never be perfect.  They could write, rewrite, revise, and polish for years in search of that perfection and never attain it.  A good writer knows when to say, "Good enough," and stop writing.
<P align=justify>A good writer is a dreamer and a realist.  A good writer has to have an active imagination.  In their head, they live with a cast of characters that in reality do not exist but in their imagination are sometimes more real than the actual people they see everyday.  A good writer dreams of events that never take place in a world that does not exist.  At the same time, a good writer wants to tell a story in as plausible and believable a way as possible.  Good writers want to give their story and their reader every possible tool at their disposal to help them suspend their disbelief and see those same characters and situations that do not really exist in as realistic a manner as possible.
<P align=justify>Good writers are their own biggest fan and their own worst critic.  Good writers are confident that their story is good, well fleshed out, thoroughly researched, presented using proper grammar, punctuation, and spelling.  Good writers know that they are good writers.  Good writers also know that they are not as good as they could possibly be with more experience, more knowledge, or more time.  Good writers know they are good but good writers are willing put their work under their own internal microscope and analyze it to shreds.  Good writers know their work is good, better than most, but almost never great.
<P align=justify>A good writer does intensive research.  Good writers research every facet of their story by whatever means available.  A good writer will interview police, medical examiners, doctors, nurses, priests, ministers, business owners, journalists, and historians.  A good writer does at least as much research as writing.
A good writer gives credit where credit is due.  Good writers nod to the sources that inspire them and offer sincere thanks.  A good writer writes acknowledgments to mentors, agents, editors, family members, and other authors. 
<P align=justify>Good writers write because they cannot help themselves.  Good writers are most comfortable, most content, most sharp when they are putting words together on a page.  Writing is many things to many writers.  For some, it is therapy.  For others it is self-expression.  For still others, it is a means of making a living.  For every writer, good or bad, writing is an act of love.
