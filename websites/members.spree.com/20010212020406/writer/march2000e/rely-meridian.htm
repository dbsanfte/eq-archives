The changing surface of the water had no mercy for the likes of me.  To a man
terrified of uniformity there dwells the endless possibility that there is <I>no</I> break in the
surface, that empty space will continue unpierced by <I>one</I> ray of hope whether the chance
of a single object we can cling to tumbling within the navigable universe or the chance of
one thought occurring between you and the nearest empty corner that waits to swallow
you whole.  Because, dear friends, the chance is so incredibly remote that we can very
well count on the despair.  Whether the brink is an infinite free-fall that awaits us in the
end or a single unforgiving line that divides the margin on one side of the paper, all are a
part of the huge dial that can only lead us to deafening volume or terrifying silence.
       <P align=justify> The nurse carried my limp body into the bathroom for a routine plunge.  He has no
understanding whatsoever, or else there would not be so many predators lying in wait (an
open magazine near the sink with, of all things, a picture of outer space on the cover
staring at me!)  My eyes darted frantically around the room looking for other mind-traps
that were inevitably there.  The man was utterly without compassion to think of leaving
me alone in such a horrifying place as a lavatory, where you can pick and choose which
appliance drowns you.
       <P align=justify> My clothes were quickly removed with a leer of unconcern and the faucet in that
white porcelain coffin was turned on.  The nurse looked at his watch as if he had better
things to do.
      <P align=justify>  I was moved steadily toward that brimming surface like a torpedo being launched
into the deep.  The rising steam permeated what little of my skin can still feel it and for
one heart-racing instant I could not see.  He placed me into the rapidly filling tub and
propped me up against the back so I could sit.
      <P align=justify>  I struggled to think quickly of everything mentionable before he disappeared out
the door.
       <P align=justify> "Now listen carefully..." I said with the maturity of my years and as professionally
as I could.  "I want you to turn that magazine over, close the toilet lid, take that picture
off the wall, and shake out the waste basket all over the room until every square foot of
empty space is gone.  And for God sakes take down that shower curtain!  You want me to
suffocate?"
       <P align=justify> He did everything I asked (except dumping out the trash), painfully slow as if he
were humoring some kind of mental patient.  Meanwhile the water was rising
uncomfortably high.  The surface was level with my upper chest when he finally turned it
off and made a beeline for the door.
     <P align=justify>   "It's dripping!" I screamed as loud as I could.  "Turn the knob as tight as you can,
idiot!  You want me to drown!"
      <P align=justify>  "I'm sorry." he said, turning it.  "Will there be anything else?"
     <P align=justify>   I couldn't help but think he was teasing me.  Having to trust him was so very
difficult, but he was the only one around.
      <P align=justify>  "I'm scared." I said desperately.  "I'm living on the edge here and I'm afraid for my
life."
       <P align=justify> He stood there and looked at me in silence.
      <P align=justify>  "I'll be down the hall.  Cry out if you need anything." he said.  "Just pretend you're
at the beach going for a swim."
     <P align=justify>   "Yes, I like the beach." I replied, willing to say anything.
<P align=justify>        He departed quickly, leaving me alone with my thoughts.
<BR><BR>
       <P align=justify> I hate the beach.  Sure I'm attracted to it like everyone else, but that is the irony. 
So many people having fun, women wearing ridiculous clothes that are so enticing to us
because they incorporate both nakedness and innocence.  But if you remove the social
factor what purpose is there for going to the beach?  An empty seashore devoid of human
life is a horror.  To stand at the edge of the world that extends beyond what you can
comprehend and dare to watch that encompassing gulf sink and swell like the utter
absence of everything we hold dear.
       <P align=justify> So what else is there?  One can say there are fish and seashells, but the last beach I
can remember before the accident had no fisherman and no shells!  It was a man-made
wasteland where even if you turn away from the shore the sand is just as endless.  And yet
the people flocked to this place and made it a paradise by socializing with each other and...
what else?  Sunbathing can be done in one's backyard, and people don't really come to the
beach to swim as they would in a pool.  They sort of flounder around in the surf that hurts
you if you open your eyes or mouth and drowns you if you go out enough to separate
yourself from the shore.  Oh why did that white-clad henchman have to mention the
beach!
       <P align=justify> We never notice that we have fallen asleep of course.  I was beginning to dwell on
the other things I could do before the accident that I took so much for granted.  In those
days I had nothing to fear from sleep or anything else for that matter because the dividing
line between me and the endless void was not quite so close.  Now it was literally up to
my neck, and my legitimate fear was simply that the paralysis would rise another inch
while I slumbered.
<BR><BR><P align=justify>
        I awoke suddenly to the sound of dripping water!  The faucet was steadily
drooling by itself and as I gasped to scream my throat filled with soapy liquid.  I choked it
out and breathed frantically through my nose but even then I was snorting froth.  The
surface had risen to a point directly between my nose and upper lip!  I gave the loudest
scream I could muster but the result was a muffled cacophony of bubbles that did not
sound human.
     <P align=justify>   "The white-clad bastard has killed me!" was the only thought racing through my
brain at that moment.  Why did he not thrust my head into the toilet and get it over with! 
He had been planning this from the start, leaving innocently beforehand to remove himself
from the equation.  This was revenge for some mild inconvenience I had caused him.  Oh
he is a villain!  A villain of Iagoan enmity.  He is a crooked man, and as they say dear
friends he walks a crooked mile.
       <P align=justify> As the waterline rose steadily I could do nothing but produce deathly bubbles that
might have been blood-red had they shown the pain.  Each gasp was more difficult as the
froth rushed in and out of my sinus barely separating from the air.
       <P align=justify> Finally the surface had passed the nose and was approaching the eyes.  My pupils
were half-moons against the lower eyelid staring downward in horror.  I had held my
breath for over a minute which is more than the paralysis would allow.  I made no sound. 
The next thing I noticed was a dull pain in the back of my head, and a deadening of the
senses.
      <P align=justify>  I was barely aware, my eyes would not close and I fully realized it was the point of
no return.  The surface of the water had risen to the middle of the pupil and then stopped,
or perhaps was it I myself that stopped?  I could see the meniscus.  I stared at that blurry,
unforgiving line, devoid of any ripple because even the eyes were motionless.  It divided
my world in half.
<BR><BR><P align=justify>
        There was a shock to the system, more intense than I should be able to feel.  The
waterline exploded into a wide meridian that engulfed my senses and spread from one
extreme to the other like a rift in space.  I hurtled forward at breathless speed or else it
was the universe streaming around me by itself, a supernova.  And what were the
intangible objects rushing past?  It was not uniform there were violent streams of blue-
grey and floating pools, momentary flecks of violet all emanating from the...  horizon?  My
eyes were fixed upon it as if I were only the conscious mind traveling and not a tumbling
body.
      <P align=justify>  The rush seemed eternal until I suddenly realized I had stopped, and probably had
been so for a while.  I had utterly lost my grasp of time.  I tried to think of whether mine
had run out or if I had an immeasurable excess, whichever was the more frightening.  For
all I know the journey was instantaneous and it took me an hour to realize it, or perhaps
we're not talking about hours, perhaps it was eons.
     <P align=justify>   "We?" a voice asked suddenly.  "You and me?"
      <P align=justify>  I blinked, looked around and became aware of the surroundings.  Everything was a
blue-grey blur, the color the bath water had been, and it had infinite substance like a fog. 
The meridian was still there in front of me, and as I walked slowly toward it I finally had a
scope of what it really was.
      <P align=justify>  It was an endless shoreline, dividing ethereal land from ethereal water that was the
same shade of blue-grey.  It divided one endless expanse from another.  And there were
celestial beings frolicking in the surf, about twenty or so.  They were the same color
themselves as a light source shone from immeasurable distance over them like the moon
on a cloudless night at the beach.  The water sparkled, and for one reason or another I
looked down at my feet to avoid looking at it.
       <P align=justify> "I can walk!!" I suddenly exclaimed, almost falling over.  I had not realized that I
could even turn my head all the way around.  I stepped with uncertainty to the left and
right, making sure of my footing on the preternatural ground.  It was not hard, but then it
was not really there at all from what I could tell.  I stretched my arms, I clenched and
unclenched my fingers.  I made a turn and walked several paces as if I had done it
yesterday.
      <P align=justify>  "Are you enjoying yourself?" the voice returned to me.
       <P align=justify> I stopped and looked around for the speaker.
     <P align=justify>   "I suppose so." I responded after a pause.  "To whom am I speaking?"
     <P align=justify>   "You already know the answer to that." it said.
       <P align=justify> "I do?"
     <P align=justify>   "Yes.  When you are addressing your 'dear friends', what friends would that be?"
     <P align=justify>   "I'm talking to myself." I replied.  "But that is not like this.  It's not a dialogue."
   <P align=justify>     "From now on it will be." the voice changed direction as if the speaker were
floating.  "Think of this as a place where your mind can spread itself out into its many
parts, unhindered by worldly obstacles.  I am the part of you that knows what is going
on."
      <P align=justify>  "And what part am I?"
       <P align=justify> "Yourself, as you have been for years.  You are the unknowing ignoramus that's
left over."
     <P align=justify>   My mouth hung open as if to invite a fly.  My instinct was to shout a furious
rebuttal but nothing happened.  It was because the realization, <I>his</I> realization, was also
mine and I understood the futility.
      <P align=justify>  "I've been waiting to talk some sense into you for some time." the voice continued. 
"Or if it's easier to grasp, <I>you</I> have wanted it.  It all started with the car accident.  Oh you
were decent at first, but over the years the paralysis turned you into a cowardly miser. 
You are obsessed with every tiny thing that frightens you.  You repel everyone around
you with your constant bickering, even the harmless nurse who doted on you with such
selflessness.  You are a pitiful excuse for a human being, and the worst part is, all this time
you have known it.  You are not compulsive because of insanity.  I am telling you now
ergo you must have known."
      <P align=justify>  I had nothing to say to this.  I felt like the numbness was taking effect again or else
a weight was pulling me into the mist below.  There was a sigh from the voice above.
        <P align=justify>"It is of no concern." it said wearily.  "Do not worry yourself."
     <P align=justify>   "Are you sure?" I inquired.
    <P align=justify>    "Think nothing more of it.  We are not here to talk about your life, miserable as it
was.  For all things concerned, your slate is clean."
      <P align=justify>  I closed my eyes, lowered my head in relief and breathed out the strongest gust of
air I had ever expelled.
    <P align=justify>    "Thank you." I said quietly.
    <P align=justify>    "Don't thank <I>me</I>." the voice replied.
    <P align=justify>    I looked up toward the transparent beings playing in the surf.  They were absorbed
in perfect bliss from what it seemed.  As I neared the shoreline I could see tiny objects like
a school of minnows moving about beneath the surface.  The sea air blew across my face
and through my hair.
    <P align=justify>    "What is this place?" I asked directly.  "Do you know?"
   <P align=justify>     "It's a dividing line between one infinite realm and another, as perceived by you
and a handful of others.  It's a point along the path that will lead you to what lies beyond."
    <P align=justify>    "I'm afraid." I said, shuddering.  "It's the one thing I'm the <I>most</I> afraid of.  Infinity."
     <P align=justify>   "Is it only that, or is it this beach that troubles you?"
  <P align=justify>      "It's not the beach." I retorted.
    <P align=justify>    "Are you sure?  Look at them, absorbed in bliss as you put it.  Have you figured it
out yet?"
   <P align=justify>     "I don't see them doing anything that people don't do on Earth." I said skeptically.
 <P align=justify>       "Look closer." the voice implored.  "Get in there yourself and see what happens."
    <P align=justify>    I walked the rest of the way to the shoreline some distance from the others, and
stopped at its lapping edge.  I held my breath and took a step into the surf, followed by
another until I was quickly up to my knees.
    <P align=justify>    "How does it feel?" the voice inquired.
    <P align=justify>    "Good." I said.  "Unworldly I suppose.  Doesn't feel like water."
   <P align=justify>     "And now look at the others.  What exactly are they doing?"
  <P align=justify>      "Communicating with each other and laughing."
     <P align=justify>   "Yes but you disqualified that, remember?  You said that socializing can be done
anywhere, regardless of the beach."
   <P align=justify>     "Spoken like a true antisocial?" I asked.
    <P align=justify>    "Look at what they are really doing.  I tell you it is the same on Earth."
     <P align=justify>   I squinted, trying to observe them from an analytical standpoint.  I focused on one
being in particular for a minute or so.  A child, or at least he seemed childlike, frolicked in
the waves spilling the liquid over his head by the handful.  He did not submerse himself,
just splashed around.  Then he returned to the shore, had a conversation with some others
and then back in the water.  Every one of them was doing this at their own pace, even the
extremely slow.  The talking and overlapping actions only disguised this peculiar schedule.
    <P align=justify>    "They are going in and out because they enjoy the difference." I stated.  "It's not
enough to have one or the other, there must be a variety."
    <P align=justify>    "More eloquently they rejoice in the separation." the voice replied.  "You see, it is
not infinite despair that awaits everyone, it is infinite possibilities.  The universe is divided
by limitless overlapping paths, strands of light if you will.  The beginning of each ocean
begets the end of another island."
      <P align=justify>  I watched the swirling water around me.  The ripples seemed to move in slow
motion.  I could swear there were tiny points reflected in the darker surface or perhaps
suspended like a liquid cosmos within.
    <P align=justify>    A school of tiny, shimmering fish darted past my legs and I reached in to grab one. 
I opened the palm of my hand, but the tiny creature within was not of the world I know. 
It was a little rectangular simplicity about an inch long with no eyes, limbs or anything
else.  I set the wriggling animal free and as it vanished to join the others a larger denizen
that was something like a shaft of light and something like an eel swam quickly by.
    <P align=justify>    "Are you ready to move on?" the voice asked of me.
   <P align=justify>     I thought about it for a few seconds.
   <P align=justify>     "What awaits me out there?" I inquired.  "What is my final destination."
    <P align=justify>    "How am I supposed to know?" it said coyly.  "I'm you, remember?"
      <P align=justify>  I stood there in the waves and looked across as far as I could see.  I looked back
toward where I think I came from.  I looked back at my life and, before the urge to deny
or circumvent something or to gripe came to mind, I knew that I could cut it short and be
at peace.  I was capable of an absolute truth.
     <P align=justify>   "I choose to stay." I replied.  "I want to play in the surf with the others."
   <P align=justify>     The voice gave no response but returned immediately to me and let me feel the
sensation.  I reached down, and grabbing the biggest handful of water I could let it splash
over me, and once it had run down my face and trickled back into the sea I did it again and
again <I>ad infinitum</I>.
