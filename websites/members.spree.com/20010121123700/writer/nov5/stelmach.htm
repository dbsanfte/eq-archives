Performance Notes on the Art of Slam Poetry

<P align=justify>

I find myself in an interesting and awkward position regarding this
article and those I have promised would follow.
<P align=justify>
In the spring issue of The Writers' Choice Literary Journal, I
introduced myself with the objective of talking on the subject of
"performance techniques for the slam poet." At that time, I had hoped to
attend every Slam event possible, at least in the Vancouver area, that
is Vancouver, British Columbia, so as to make my comments as pertinent
to the slam poet as possible. Unfortunately I have slammed off more than
I can chew. I simply do not have the time it would take to attend these
events without my own writing suffering.

<P align=justify>However, I do not intend to give up the Dunk. As an ex-actor and
storyteller, I have many years of experience as a performer and a number
of notes on performance that may be helpful to the fledgling slam poet
and perhaps a few veterans as well. And so, with the consent of the
editor's of this ezine, I shall go ahead with my series of articles with
a slight deviation from my initial intentions. 

<P align=justify>In other words, I shall outline the series of performance techniques
first suggested and link them less to slam poetry in particular and more
to the performance of poetry in general. Working alphabetically, let us
begin with the use of accents on stage. Not an often used device for
poets, but one used often enough to make it worth while.

<P align=justify><U>Accents</U>

<P align=justify>Both as a writer and a performance poet one should use accents
sparingly. This is not to say that you should shy away from them
entirely. An accent can add wonderful nuance to any piece of writing or
performance. However, both readers and listeners alike have difficulty
tuning their eye or ear to something new or out of the norm; so it is
absolutely necessary that your accent not be thick (as in a thick
Brogue) but simply hinted at. In other words, every word should not be
'of an accent.' Establish it, make it clear in the minds of your
listeners that you are using an accent and what specific accent it is,
then move away from it, saving it for 'key words,' one here, another
there. Once it has been established your audience will suspend its
disbelief and believe your accent to be true while still understanding
every word.

<P align=justify>Use an accent you are accustomed to hearing or one you have studied
extensively. In the first place use an accent you have known from
childhood and perhaps mimicked a little already. One you have heard at
home or in the neighborhood for years. If you have a good ear it will
come naturally to you. But as mentioned above, tune it down a little.
Make sure your audience understands every word. Secondly, there are many
good books and audiotapes on the subject of accents or dialects that can
be borrowed from the library or ordered from your local bookstore. One
excellent reference book is Stage Dialects by Jerry Blunt, published by
Chandler Publishing Company.

<P align=justify>Once you have worked with your accent and feel confident in its accuracy
and clarity try it out on a sympathetic friend. Do they recognize the
origin of your accent? Do they understand what you are saying? Once your
sympathetic listener answers, 'Yes,' you are ready for an audience of
strangers.

<P align=justify>When using any accent, one should make every effort not to make fun of
another nationality. Racial jokes and slurs make for easy and cheap
laughter, while their intent is derisive. On the one hand they pump up
the insecure ego of the jokester, while cruelly debasing those made the
butt of the joke.

<P align=justify>In closing, have fun with your accent. Make it yours. And as long as you
do your audience will believe.
