	<b><P>I have one of those children, the crazy ones who
rush headlong into everything without a seconds
thought?</P>


<P>He's started this new thing in the last few weeks
called "PUSH" where he pushes everyone and everything
with all his might. That includes me, his Dad, walls,
doors, other kids  at McDonalds (to the scowling of
other mothers at McDonalds), the car door, the front
door, his toys, the dog ... I could go on but I think
you get the picture. All the while he shouts at the top
of his voice "PUUUUUSH!". It's his new word and he's
taking it for a test run with actions included.</P>


<P>I've tried to cease this new game since I am tiring of
being beaten up by a two-year-old on a daily basis but
I've not had any success. It was with my lack of parental
control in mind that I came to the oldest trick in the
book, the "if you keep doing that one day....".</P>


<P>With that new approach ready to fire I employed a new tactic,
I started saying "you know, one day you're going to hurt
yourself doing that, one of those doors you push is going
to bounce back and hit you in the face". He looked at me
quizzically at first, probably because he's two and I think
I overstepped his level of comprehension, after looking at
me like that for a few seconds he ran to the bedroom door
and pushed it yet again with his little war cry at full pitch.</P>

<P>
I guess because he's two what he probably heard was "door,
push, bounce, COOL!" or something like that.</P>


<P>I kept at it for the week, sure that I was making inroads and
then today, what do you know? As for all motherly prophecies
beginning with "if you keep doing that, one day...." it came
true. Today the bedroom door attacked my son just like I said
it would, bounced right back after an especially vigorous
pushing incident and WHAM! bopped him right in the face.</P>


<P>He came screaming, crying his little heart out and I picked him
up and cuddled him and kissed it better and for the first time
in my parental career I got to say those ever so sweet words
...... I told you so.</P>


<P>Eventually he calmed down and we decided that a milkshake was
in order at the local mall, just what he needed to overcome
the last niggling pain the bump was brining on. By the time we
arrived at the mall the welt on his head was of gigantic
proportions. Right above his eye it was, that spot where the
bumps really swell up and look particularly nasty. He looked
like he'd just done 10 rounds with the meanest kid in the
McDonalds playground and come off second best.</P>

<P>
We wandered in to the mall and looked around and I couldn't
for the life of me figure out why everyone was looking at me
so strangely. I went through the checkout to stares and
whispers, the milkshake lady hardly looked at me straight and
they were all looking at my son. He's cute, I'll grant him
that, but not THAT cute even with motherly bias taken into
account.</P>


<P>Then ... as I walked out the doors with a happy and milkshake
filled two year old it dawned on me, out of nowhere. I realise
they were looking at his head and assuming I'd it or something
equally horrific. At first I was mortified, how DARE people
make such assumptions! How DARE they think I could do that to
my son, I adore him!</P>


<P>And then I began to realise that it was good that people assumed
things like that, there are kids who are being abused and it's
good that they assume since maybe one day they'll be right, all
those blue rinse ladies in the supermarket line. Maybe one day
they'll take down someone's number plate and report them and catch
a child abuser and have the children kids whisked away to safety.
That's a GOOD thing.</P>


<P>As good as that is, let it be known I DIDN'T do it! Just know, if
you're shopping at Deepwater Plaza in Woy, Woy, NSW, Australia and
you see me -- purple stroller, green trim, tattoo on my forehead
saying "it wasn't me" -- just wave, nod and if you're feeling
particularly bold give me a secret wink and handshake because now
we both know, it really, was the door!</P>
