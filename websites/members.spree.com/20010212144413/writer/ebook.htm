"Everything You Need to Know About Being a Woman Can be Learned in the
Garden" - Patricia Fish
DLSIJ Press, 1999<BR>

       <P align=justify> When some of the members of the Hillery Beach Garden Club decided
that talk show hosts and their expert-in-the-field guests really don't do
an adequate job of advising women about life, the seed for this book was
planted. Nurtured by core group meetings, open forum discussions, and
lectures by their own experts, the Hillery Beach Garden Club's efforts bore
fruit and the tome blossomed. Names of celebrities, frequently railed
against, have been changed to protect the, uh, well, not the innocent, but
at least the titular authors.
       <P align=justify> The first part of each chapter is devoted to an exploration of life
in the garden. Robins, wrens, dogs, squirrels all serve as examples of the
theme of that particular chapter. This is then followed by a summary of the
meeting held to discuss the particular topic, or at least to try to discuss
the topic. Throughout the book, we find the group-appointed scribe and
self-appointed rabble rouser, Cindy Byer, wreaking havoc on the calm
logical discussions that are supposed to take place. This erstwhile
firebrand fills her friends with awe and wonder (or is that wondering why
they invited her to be scribe?) as she launches into invective reminiscent
of an Emily Littela tirade. Although this tends to be irritating after
several chapters, it does lead to a surprising and fitting denouement.
      <P align=justify>  Each chapter closes with bulleted pearls of wisdom gleaned by these
women from their discussions; after all, leaving a record of the advice
they would pass on to those who follow is the reason behind the book. Some
of these bon mots are truly pithy and worthy of digesting; others are just
chaff, to be easily blown away.
       <P align=justify> The humor that pervades the entire book does not detract from the
solid advice that is given. Indeed, as with the remarks of Kozinski's
Chance Gardener, this book demonstrates that one can learn much from
looking at the world as though it were a garden, if one but scratches below
the surface.

"Maggie" by Sherri Jilek.  DLSIJ Press, 1999<BR>


      <P align=justify>  Beginning with less than auspicious travel in her early life, the
titular subject of this book has many more difficult journeys ahead. We
follow the life of Maggie Bainbridge through letters she writes to her
aunt, as well as narrative text. Interestingly, we first glimpse Maggie
from her aunt's perspective, and it is not until very late in the book that
the focus changes to life seen through Maggie's eyes. The shift seems to
signify a "coming of age", as if recognizing that *this* is the turning
point that marks Maggie's maturation into adulthood.
     <P align=justify>   The book is, for the most part, a sedate, almost humdrum story,
pleasantly told. The pace of the book is somewhat skewed; the bulk of the
book skips through the early years in short chapters, but the last few
chapters are much longer and describe a shorter time span in greater
detail. There are segments that almost seem preachy, as religion and
spirituality are presented, but there are some good old-fashioned values
that are brought home as well. From this tone, we can tell that there will
be trouble ahead when Maggie's fiance opts out of church-going. And it is,
in fact, the foreshadowed trouble that pulls the book out of the doldrums.
At last, some action!
   <P align=justify>     How much action can be stuffed into the few remaining chapters? Is
it worth reading to find out? Yes. The astute reader will have seen the
signs of trouble much earlier, and the final chapters allow one to say
"See? I *knew* this sort of thing would happen! If only...." There is an
element of danger and suspense, as Maggie allows her love for her husband
to outweigh her common sense, and even override her aunt's suggestions.
   <P align=justify>     After all of the detail in the chapters immediately preceding it,
the ending is a bit weak. The path has not only been cleared for this
ending, the road has been paved and lighted like a runway; it's no surprise
ending for us. But the sketchiness following the tense action leaves the
reader feeling almost deserted. Nevertheless, "Maggie" is the sort of book
to read on a rainy afternoon, or in spurts between chores.

"Woman Justice" by Rosalyn Wraight.
DLSIJ Press, 1998

    <BR><P align=justify>    This book opens as a murder mystery when a pile of bones is found
just off a wooded path, and Detective McCallister starts an investigation.
There is a quick shift to follow the life of Emily Decker, a prominent
murder mystery writer, and  lesbian who has become all but a recluse.  Ms.
Decker is suffering from writer's block, and has missed numerous deadlines
for her newest book.
        <P align=justify>There is a little back and forth between the two themes before the
author settles us in with Emily  for a prolonged stay. Emily has been cut
off from her family and doesn't appear to have any friends. In fact, she is
portrayed so much the crazed loner that I was prepared to object to this
picture of the "poor lesbian writer" after the first few chapters. It seems
that Emily has managed, Pygmalion-like, to bring one of her creations, a
character named Milicent, to life. And Milicent becomes more real as she
gets Emily to agree to write more and more about her. There follow several
chapters, each detailing a short story involving Milicent and Emily, though
not named. All of the stories are erotic. Very erotic.
      <P align=justify>  Emily becomes more and more jealous of her time with Milicent, to
the point of even ordering the housekeeper to stay away. Has Emily finally
gone overboard? Is she even sane at this point?
        <P align=justify>In a violent wrench back to the murder case, McCallister reappears
suddenly with warrants and a bevy of suspects. In form reminiscent of
McCallister's favorite author, Agatha Christie, the detective proceeds to
outline for the reader who it was that was killed, and who did it. We even
see a Perry Mason-like confession at the end. Where McCallister got the
clues from, we have no idea. There is no background for this that the
reader is privy to, which makes the revelations all the more shocking. Just
when we think that all is settled, however, there is one final revelation
in the last few pages that puts all in a new light again.
        <P align=justify>Is this book a true murder mystery, or is the outer plot just
window dressing for the erotica? The lack of clues for the reader to help
solve the mystery and the jerky switches back and forth between storylines
almost make it seem the latter. Character development is a bit shallow as
well. I'd like to know more about Detective McCallister than just the
surface that we're shown. Perhaps Wraight is considering a series with
McCallister, and plans to develop the character more fully later; one can
only hope so. There is much promise for a hearty read here, but the tidbits
we're given just serve to whet the appetite.
  <P align=justify>      The erotica is almost formulaic: girl meets girl and girl beds
girl. The scenery changes, but the basic flavor of the stories remains the
same; a gypsy-like character and a writer appear in almost all of them. The
descriptions of the action vary enough to lend some spice, however, and as
alluded to above, the scenes are enticing. The amount and quality of detail
provided in the short stories would be welcome in the rest of the book as
well.
       <P align=justify> "Woman Justice" is a novel that will keep the reader's attention
and interest, if only to try to figure out how the storylines relate. When
they do finally come together, the outcome is a series of surprises that
take the reader on an emotional rollercoaster.

 Ravigo Zomana, a writer who produced most of her best work when
upset, decided not to have a miserable life just so that she could earn a
living. She opted instead for a career in a totally unrelated field, but
also spent over a decade as a writer, reviewer, photographer and editor for
a newspaper. In addition, she did some work as a copy editor for a literary
advocate (Bearlife). She continues to read voraciously as well as editing and writing
when she can.
