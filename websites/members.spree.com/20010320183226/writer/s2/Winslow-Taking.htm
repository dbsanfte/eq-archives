<P>	Two young people met in their senior year of high school.  They dated for 
several months, becoming very close by the time graduation rolled around.  
The problem was, the young woman had made plans to attend college halfway 
across the country prior to meeting the young man.  These plans could not be 
changed so at the end of summer following graduation the couple said their 
tearful goodbyes and each went their separate way.  </P>


<P>The young man was devastated and felt lost without the young woman in his 
life.  He had a very difficult decision to make - either accept her leaving 
as fate and try as best he could to move on, or to take charge of his own 
destiny and do something about the situation.  The young man decided to take 
action.</P>


<P>Packing all his belongings into his car and taking what little money he had, 
he set off to find the young woman.  Though he had a line on a job, he did 
not know if this would materialize nor did he know where he would live, how 
long the money in his pocket would hold out, or even if the young woman 
wanted him to come - he had not told her of his plans to follow her.  
</P>

<P>None of these things mattered.  The young man was not about to let the fear 
of the unknown stop him from following his heart - from taking charge of his 
own destiny.  He was excited and terrified at the same time.  He felt more 
alive than he had ever felt before and, even if things turned out badly, he 
could always take comfort in the fact he had tried...</P>


<P>In our lives we are all faced with a multitude of choices to make, problems 
to solve, and stands to take.  But before we can deal with these issues, we 
must first make a more fundamental decision  do we even want to deal with 
these issues in our lives? </P> 


<P>In the most simplistic of terms, there are basically two camps of people - 
those who actively participate in their own destiny, and those who 
essentially let life happen to them.</P>  


<P>The problem with belonging to the passive camp is this approach resigns us to 
a life of mediocrity.  A life where hopes and desires go unrealized and 
dreams are unfulfilled.  When we sit idly by hoping life will simply happen 
to us, what really happens is nothing- life ends up passing us by.  
</P>

<P>Arguably, this is a very safe existance, but is this really living?   It's 
true those in the passive camp may save themselves from major failures and 
devastating pain, but they also rob themselves of the chance for great 
success and immense joy.</P>


<P>IT'S FAR BETTER TO HAVE TRIED AND FAILED, 
THAN NEVER TO HAVE TRIED AT ALL.</P>


<P>Without actively making tough choices, taking risks, and directing our own 
destiny, we can never expect any true meaning or happiness to come from our 
lives.  That is not to say those who belong to the ACTIVE camp won't 
experience pain, most certainly will. </P> 


<P>We can't reach for the stars and not expect to occasionally fall short.  
That's okay.  Pain and failure are as important and necessary as joy and 
success, for without one you cannot have the other. </P> 


<P>Our lives are what we make of them.  We are indeed the masters of our own 
destiny - or at least we can be.  It's up to each of us to decide which camp 
we will belong.  Will we have the courage to really live our lives?  To 
follow our dreams no matter what the outcome?  To risk failure and pain in 
the hopes of attaining success and joy?  Or will we let our fears and 
insecurities condemn us to a life unfulfilled?  A life which offers as little 
pain as it does joy. </P>
 

<P>What ever became of the young couple in the story?  As you may have guessed, 
that young man was me nearly twenty years ago.   And I did find the girl.  
After driving for eighteen straight hours across several states, I was 
reunited with my one true love outside her college dorm. We've been together 
ever since and I certainly don't plan on letting her slip away ever again.  
</P>

<P>With that road trip years ago, I made a conscience effort to take charge of 
my own destiny.  In doing so, my life has had many ups and downs.  It has 
been an adventure for sure, but more than that, it has been an adventure by 
choice.  Not all my decisions have been good ones, but at least they were 
mine.  And I only need to look as far as my wife - the young girl I surprised 
outside her dorm so many years ago, and to think of our children and the life 
we've made together, to understand the importance of taking charge of your 
own destiny. </P>
