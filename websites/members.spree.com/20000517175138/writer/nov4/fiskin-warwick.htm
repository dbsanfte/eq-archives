         <FONT size="+2"><BR>
                           
    ©  Gene Fiskin

<P align=justify>
    None recall me now.  I have been long forgot.  A cruel end, oblivion, I had hoped for a kinder fate.  
Once I walked as carefree as any man, a scholar with a gift for rhyme.  I embraced the Spring, made love, and even as you may have done yourself, boasted of deeds not yet achieved.  Yet, at the same time I was plagued by an odd fear.  A prosaic enough affliction, often treated as foolish by others.  Still, it took only a notion of tight, tiny places to blank my mind with panic.  It was for me a vile and special dread, and how I envied those unfettered by such company. That transcendent fright, as well as a certain insolence of office, is the spine of this uncommon tale.
<P align=justify>For the birthing of a trifling limerick my fate was forfeit.  As its creator I felt a native pride for its insight, if not diplomacy.  Yet, I was sought out by the "Kingmaker" and dealt-with in repugnant ways.  Judge for yourself, how hateful could any reasonable man find these lines?   <BR>
<CENTER> "There once was an Earl, name of  Warwick,<BR>
whose ambitions exceeded rhetoric.<BR>
He whined and he puled,<BR>
and his deeds amply fueled<BR>
an end to the Crown, now historic." <BR></CENTER>

<P align=justify>Admittedly, a conceit of the young, but designed to prick, not wound.  Surely, no more than a simple entertainment.  However, I misjudged the eagerness of authority to take offense, forgetting wickedness is unforgiving unless otherwise portrayed.


<P align=justify>My lyrical efforts reached the ears of the Earl at a time not cordial to polemic discourse.  Once the author was clearly identified, the Earl, graciously it seemed, extended an invitation expressing himself receptive to alternative ideas, and open to discussion.  And so it was, flattered and self-esteemed, I left one day for Castle Warwick.  
<P align=justify>It was storming when I arrived and the deluge obscured my way.  But then the waves of pounding rain parted momentarily and I glimpsed the shrouded vision that loomed ahead.  With that sight, a shiver so frigid and frightful ran down my frame, I feared I should freeze to the spot.  
<P align=justify>The fortress, cold and formidable, appeared to hover several leagues beyond the ends of the earth.  I was reminded that common, if biased knowledge, had it that for those outside the good Earl's favor, these were the flesh and bones of Hell.   But I thought myself a privileged guest, and bearing his invite, assuredly secure.  That fancy fled when, upon showing it, a squad of his men grabbed and beat me to the ground.
<P align=justify>How a discussion with the Earl may have gone, I quickly realized, was of singular inconsequence.  Warwick, it appeared, had settled debate alone.  And I, having been judged without speaking a word, had foolishly authored my own misery by delivering myself for censure. 
<P align=justify>His men were large and well armed, excessively for so small a purpose.  The beating took place in the downpour and while I writhed in the mud they showered me with blows.  I was still conscious when they hauled me away to complete their odious mission.  
<P align=justify>Beneath the tower was a sparse, brutal room, and it rang with the screams and pleas and whimpers of broken men.  To reach it, one followed the smell of death down rocky steps.  The dungeon's stones were burnished with a kind of luster, bounty from the bleeding bodies of victims dragged that way.  
From rafters hung black iron cages in human form; and it is a fact that left to die in mid-air, mighty men wept openly when fitted in this metal garb.  But these rascalities would be denied me, I was destined for other mischief.
<P align=justify>Off to one side in a tiny niche there was an oubliette.  Holding a torch over it was a man-at-arms given to easy laughter, and it was by his wavering light I met this place of distinctive torment.
Thrown forward by Warwick's soldiers, I fell before a small opening in the stone floor. There, hard by the oubliette, they forced me to uncertain feet and by the light of that single torch made me stand and gaze within.
Cold and empty it was, like an eye... long dead.  Beyond the thick stone there waited a low space carved in the earth, arranged to accommodate a living body.  Ample enough to wriggle about, but not a site for long life. Inured to my shouts and squeals, they thrust me into this living tomb and fastened its great stone lid in place.  
Not a trickle of light did enter, and I know not how long I lay in the dark shocked into silence, for time stands idle in the grave.  Be assured it was not of lengthy duration, for all around me I felt the earth and knew I had been buried alive.  In such an arena the pressing thought is that life is a condition better forgot, and it takes little time for counsel like this to inspire personal bedlam.
<P align=justify>One does not do well beneath the ground.  It is terrible for anyone to die in a cramped blackened void, with useless eyes and ears, but for me it was a nightmare of remarkable anguish.  
Ragged breathing and the frenzied beating of one's own heart are frightening sounds in perfect stillness.  In that dark and resolute silence, I found screaming a painful but curious comfort.
<P align=justify>Soon, in this close and terrifying realm, I strangled on the howls of horror flying back from impenetrable stone just inches away.  In utter darkness I clawed frantically at the roof that was my keepers' floor.  Scratching at unyielding stone while bloody rivulets ran down my arms. 
<P align=justify>My soiled, already failing body - clammy with cold sweat, ropy clots and waste, fell in on itself and cracked beneath the strains of my demented shrieks.  Not long after, there were few signs of humanity left in that desolate vault.
<P align=justify>Death came with time, but not in time.  First one's ruined mind must go.  Only when empty of hope and thought is the corpus free to fail and die.
<P align=justify>Beneath a mountain of stone that small sliver of bitter space still lies.  A hamper filled to overflowing with crazed and crowded phantoms...and I among them, in a cubbyhole of horror.  
Tightly held, we haunt and screech in silence in this tiny place of forgetting.  And we specters thrash in lockstep, cold and past remembering, in the oubliette of Warwick.
