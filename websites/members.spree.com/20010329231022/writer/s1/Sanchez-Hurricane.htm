	<P>Are you new to the world of Internet business? Then you may fit into one of 
three categories and those categories are hurricane syndrome, fog syndrome 
or a clear day aficionado! What's that you ask?</P>

<P>You're in business on the net and may find yourself in a hurricane 
syndrome! Yes to some of you Internet business is like a hurricane raining 
traffic of confusion, excitement and allusive money. Not understanding 
which move to make next. Or maybe a fog syndrome with your dreams of 
success just out of reach but you know you will walk out of that foggy haze 
and realize your dream of success any day now if you continue doing what 
you are doing! Probably not! A proven definition of insanity is, "To 
continue doing what you are doing but expecting a different outcome!"
</P>
<P>Then there are the "Clear Day Aficionados" who have it all together and 
have a completely successful business that truly is a hurricane of money 
raining down on them with foggy shadows of even greater success looming on 
the horizon. How did they get there?</P>

<P>The "Clear Day Aficionados" have utilized the hurricane and the fog and 
cleared their path and raised the blanket of fog by looking in all the 
right places. Reading all the right things and following all the right 
people or person's tips and tricks to successful wealth on the Internet. 
Have not attempted to cut a new path but follow the path that brought those 
others through the fog and hurricanes of the Internet and bringing them as 
well! But most of all they jumped in and just went to work following the steps.
</P><P>
Okay now let's get you into that "Clear Day Aficionado" position real soon. 
The steps to doing that are;
</P>
<P><U>STUDY THOSE SUCCESSFUL ONES</U> who have what you want and follow their plan to 
get what you want. No you do not want to try to make a new path on the 
Internet right now. Save that for the day you have the riches and wealth 
you desire then go out there and cut a path through the ravages of 
destruction that has taken it's toll on the majority of Internet 
entrepreneurs. Don't fall into the trap of thinking that all you have to do 
is put a lot of money into your business/project and it will bring back 
much more money!</P>

<P>Yes, be prepared to spend some money but do it wisely by utilizing it to 
purchase those things that truly bring in traffic and money to your business!
</P>
<P>Start with the PROFESSIONAL WEBSITE DESIGN and SOFTWARE TO AUTOMATE your 
website, a must if you are to reach the tens of thousands of people you 
need to reach and keep in constant contact until they have the total 
picture about your business. If your site is gorgeous and very enticing 
with all the right products necessary to make it possible for anyone to be 
successful but you lack the ability to follow up daily, weekly or monthly 
or offer backend products, shut down now!</P>

<P>Lack of follow-up is one of the top reasons businesses fail. No one is 
actually taking care of customers/clients. If you had a storefront in any 
city and people walked in but nobody helped them make the decisions or 
purchases how long do you think that store is going to last? Not very! 
We've all seen vacant stores on any street in the world sitting there 
forlorn and lonely in a great location but someone failed. You will usually 
find two reasons for those failures. One is lack of advertising and two 
assisting or follow-up with their </P>customers.

<P>Online businesses are in the same boat and need those two elements. 
Advertising will bring needed TRAFFIC TO YOUR SITE. There is no one 
advertising medium on the net that will drive enough traffic to your site 
to put that financial success in your pocket. I have found that multiple 
advertising traffic mediums are necessary.</P>
<P>
The following are all mediums I work with and at to succeed.</P>

<P><U>1)      Banners.</U> A lot of people will tell you that banners are passe and 
don't work anymore. I have found this to be my number one traffic magnet. I 
have my banner exchange linked to tens of thousands of other sites that 
bring in a large portion of my daily traffic slightly behind at #2.
</P><P><U>2)      Writing articles to help others giving tidbits from my experiences 
in my 63 years of life.</U> I learned a long time ago that helping people be 
the best they can be gave me not only pleasure but got me the riches I 
wanted. No, I do not do it just for that purpose but have found lasting 
friendships and business associates by just helping them to maybe find a 
piece of knowledge that they were searching for or have shown empathy as 
they went along their learning path. Written word is such a powerful medium 
at helping others!</P>
<P>3)     <U> Building my newsletter list and disseminating accurate and timely 
information with my very own list server.</U> By using my own list server I am 
not carrying anyone else's' advertising to build their business.
</P><P>4)      <U>Helping others to get where they want to go by sharing my special 
secretary.</U> My secretary is not a person but a great piece of software that 
allows me to follow up over and over while I'm sleeping, writing this 
article or off shopping and I don't even have to think about it. My 
secretary's name is *Sales Manager* and manages my business life 24/7.
</P><P>5)      <U>Following a guru who has already gotten where I wanted to go and 
freely willing to guide me through the fog and winds of the Net. </U> Yes my 
guru has become a multi-millionaire online and I figure if he did it he 
knew some secrets that I needed to know and sure enough he does and shares 
them with me daily by phone and or email!</P>
<P>6)      <U>Having the right products that are a proven big seller on the 
Internet.</U> Those products (proven by multiple survey's for the last five 
years) are the tools and software to building a business on the net that 
are assembled in one place that work together like well oiled machinery on 
my computer giving me the least problems. Tools I can help others with in a 
big way!</P>
<P>7)      <U>Lastly but most importantly are *Tenacity* and 
*Stick-to-it-ive-ness*</U> that carried me and will carry you through the hard 
times in the beginning. Two traits that are a must have to obtain success 
as a Home Based Business person! You cannot expect to be up for just a 
short while and become an overnight wealthy person. Doesn't work outside 
the net and won't work inside it either.</P>
<P>
Go and prosper in grace and knowledge and wealth.</P>
