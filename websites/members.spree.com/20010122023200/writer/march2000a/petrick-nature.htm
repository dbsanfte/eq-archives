    ©  Joseph C. Petrick<FONT size="+1">                                                                                                                                  
<BR><P align=justify><b>
Is the nature of love like a longing fledging lost in a cave of disillusionment?  As I sit here in the dark reaching out towards the skies and the heavens of my want. Around me, like so many explosions, love's rapture consumes and deludes in a type of ecstasy known to no man or beast.  Here I sit, empty but for the worms of my thoughts.  My multiple arms coming to greet me with empty hands and scorn faces embedded upon each fingertip.  I am the shadow play; I am the theater of dirt.  The audience does not attend; the seats lie bare for my performance. It's unfolding inexcusable and it's ending unwatched.  Longing, ever for the cliffs that break those torrents of waves as they wash and crash over my heart.  I've known it all; I've seen all that is to come.  I have scourged myself of joy; I have desolated myself from rapture.  I have taken that which has lifted my soul to the very brink of explosion with joy, and torn it to the ground.  Buried beneath my actions, it lies decaying and dead beneath my feet.  My hands crumple from my arms, my eyes dry within their home.  Home.  Home is the end, home is the beginning.  Within furious storms of servitude I work against the wind but I fail before it reaches its pinnacle.  
<P align=justify>There was a time when all I wanted was within my grasp.  When the stars and the flowers seemed as bright as the days which illuminated them.  By my hand that is gone. By my hand I wallow in the stench that I do now.  Even though love is delusion and purity intertwined, I long for its security.  
To the left and right the beauty arises in mystery and majesty for all to witness.  All but me.  I, enslaved in my box, receive no light, no sun, none of the joy or the rapture of love.  Slight rays of contentment do not even break through the crevices which I begin to think are forming in my cell.  
<P align=justify>I want to break out…I wish to stand at the height of the mountain again. To reach up into the sky and pluck the stars for my feast.  I don't want to do it alone anymore.  Carbon copies of my desire only leave me tired and broken.  My bones aching from having to heal over and over.  My stomach aches from the taste of my own bile, rising at my own disgust.  If I could only taste the lips once more, nestle within the arms of my wants and of my wills.  It's so cold where I am.  Not all deserts are of sand…most are of ice and frigid wind.  Most are within me. <P align=justify> 
Some don't think that I can survive much longer.  Dancing away from my vision in speckles of darks and grays.  They think I shall be broken.  I was never whole.  
<P align=justify>I'm just too cold, too alone.  Fury, pure fury.  Like an unquenchable fire begins to break through my wooden skin.  If I fall into it all I risk losing what I am now, but what is that in all?  
There is no one alive that can touch me now.  No one that can speak my name and bring a calm. No one in the world.  No one that I know.  There is no one in the world that would be willing to tread this desert of ice with me.  I am a body of fire treading a dessert of ice.  I sink with every step so the journey is long, hard, and unforgiving. <P align=justify> 
I want rest, I want love again.  Sometimes I feel like everything I hate.  Sometimes I am the desert that I tread.  Sometimes the fire goes out.  Sometimes…
