<BR>
                           
      <FONT size="+2">© Gregg Bridgeman
 <BR>  <BR>
<BR>
<FONT size="+1">
<P align=justify>
A vast number of writers go to great lengths in preparing to write their manuscript before they actually write it.  While there are good points to this, there are also what could be bad points.  It comes down to this: Go through a preparation process that works for you.  If it works for you, then it has to be good.
<BR><P align=justify>There are three basic methods of preparation that I am familiar with.  They are; Outline, Synopsis, and Notes.
In order to outline, you basically break your story down into its most basic components.  For example, a novel might look like this:
<pre>
My Novel
I.  Chapter 1
	A. Scene 1
		1.  Set scene
			a. Time is morning
			b. Scene is a greasy spoon breakfast joint
		2. Introduce Lead Character
			a. Introduce our hero sitting in booth
			b. Introduce his love interest by having her walk in
		3.  Introduce conflict
			a. Our hero says he does not like mother of his love interest
			b. Love interest tells our hero she thinks that he is a big fat jerk
		4. Have love interest storm out
			a. She says a few witty lines on way out of restaurant
			b. Morning crowd and waitresses clap and cheer for her
			c. Our hero is very embarrassed
	B. Scene 2 (etc.)
</pre>
<BR><P align=justify>You get the picture.  Now while I admire the structure, I personally do not like to outline my work.  The reason that I do not like it, while other authors swear by it, is that my characters often tell me different aspects of the story while I write.  If I restricted them to the outline, then I feel like it might stifle my creativity.  If my characters rebelled against that structure, I would spend a lot of time revising my outline instead of writing.
<BR><P align=justify>While there is a valid argument that outlines sometimes bind the manuscript with unnecessary rules and structure, there is also the other side of the coin.  Outlines are a good tool to consolidate your thoughts.  They help some writers by giving them an underpinning, a foundation upon which to build the story.  This is why some authors swear by them.
<BR><P align=justify>The other benefit of outlines is that sometimes editors and agents like to see them.  Again, I personally never provide outlines to anyone.  I would not be comfortable interfacing with an agent in particular, that preferred an outline over the work itself.  I find that my personality does not interface well with that personality type.  Nevertheless, if you like to use outlines, you will probably have little problem securing an agent or editor who is also an admirer of outlines.
<BR><P align=justify>The simplest way to find out if outlines might be a good tool for you is to try it.  Sit down with a notebook and your story idea and try constructing an outline.  If you decide it works for you, great.  Use it.  If not, get back to writing as soon as possible.
<BR><P align=justify>Another way to prepare to write your manuscript is to create a synopsis.  A synopsis is like a summary of the key action.  It might look like this.
<BR>
My Novel<BR>
<BR><P align=justify>In Chapter 1, scene 1, our hero sits alone at a booth in a greasy spoon breakfast joint.  His love interest walks in and they make small talk.  Our hero lets it slip that he does not like his love interest's mother.  Love interest gets angry and storms out with some choice words for our hero.  The other clientele and the waitresses applaud her as she leaves.
<BR><P align=justify>In scene 2, etc.

<BR><P align=justify>The above is an example of a working synopsis.  This is not the same type of synopsis that you would submit to an agent or an editor.  In that type of synopsis, you would never say the words chapter or scene.  A working synopsis is a tool to help you lay out your story.  When writing a novel, creating a synopsis beforehand in order to prepare may be a little easier than outlining and a little more useful.  It allows for a certain amount of flexibility and is also a bit easier to revise.  Synopsis style has a lot in common with preparatory notes but is not as comprehensive.
<BR><P align=justify>Notes involves writing what amounts to a rough draft and including notes along the way.  Some authors will write their entire manuscript out freehand in notes and then go back and type it into their word processor.  An example of notes may be something like this.

<BR><P align=justify>My Novel
<BR><P align=justify>Chapter 1
<BR><P align=justify>Our hero, Lance Hairychest, sits alone at a booth in a greasy spoon breakfast joint.  Describe the restaurant and the morning crowd.  Describe Lance.  He is 5'10" with dark hair and eyes, about 24 years old, just out of school.
<BR><P align=justify>It's early in the morning and he thinks about the fight he had with his future mother-in-law on the telephone the night before.  Write a little flashback of that scene.  (This will be important in Chapter 2 when we meet her.)
<BR><P align=justify>Lance comes out of the flashback when his love interest, Penelope Wholesome, walks in and says good morning.  Penny sits and they make small talk.  Describe Penny.  She is 5'4" and 22 in her senior year at the Community College.  (In the next scene, use Penny's POV and have her drive past the college)
Lance is clearly distracted and Penny asks what's wrong.  Lance tells Penny about the argument he had with her mother the previous evening.  Unexpectedly, Penny defends her mother this time and Lance gets angry.  He tells Penny he does not see how they can have a future if her mother hates his guts.  She says they probably do not have a future if he cannot find a way to get along with her mother.  She storms out without eating, sticking Lance with the bill, and calling him a big jerk.
 <BR><P align=justify>The other clientele and the waitresses applaud Penny's words as she leaves, leaving Lance angry, embarrassed, and hurt.

<BR><P align=justify>Try some of these methods out and see if it helps spark your creativity.  Good writing.
