the Internet</FONT><br>

	<FONT FACE="Courier New" COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1">
	<P>So many people know so little about WWII and what impact it has had 
on our everyday lives today. Perhaps the most important thing, which 
we may know, is WWII made the world a much safer place. But, we don't 
realize how much this great global war gave us in our everyday lives.
</P>
<P>I had the privilege of gaining this awareness when we recently 
participated in a Small Business Expo in the Pinehurst Area of North 
Carolina. Other than website development, our business also offers 
computer related business services and training, private computer 
tutoring, and owns retail websites. Both individuals and business 
owners are clientele to us. We had a wide variety of both types of 
visitors in our booth.</P>

<P>But, this short story is really about a very interesting man I met 
that day – and how much I learned by meeting him - about WWII and
the many electronic conveniences, including the Internet, that we now 
enjoy today.</P>

<P>A man approached me in our booth at this Expo and asked me if I would 
consider reviewing a book he had written, and perhaps consider 
helping him market the book online. His name is George H. Sweet. My 
initial reaction was how sharp, and what a direct and honest business 
approach this man had. He was also very comfortable and easy to talk 
with. Intrigued, I started asking him questions about the book, its 
contents, and what audience were potential readers of the book.</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Mr. Sweet is a retired Naval Veteran, who had 
participated in World War II as the Captain of the USS LST 358  - all 
at the young age of 24. The title of the book is, "Lightning 
Strikes". Mr. Sweet wrote and published this book for many
reasons, one of which is his desire for young people to know more 
about World War II.</P>

<P>Of course, we were busy in the Expo booth that day, but I did agree 
to consider Mr. Sweet's requests. He went to his car and brought
back a copy of the book to give me. The following day, after the Expo 
was over and we were settling down in the office again, I took some 
time to read through the book.</P>

<P>Now, being "thirty-something+", I'm not that young, and do have some 
knowledge of World War II. But what impressed me about this book was 
how much I learned about "the Amphibs", a new arm of the US Navy that 
was implemented at the time. It is also loaded with on site period 
photography, which as a collector and lover of "old things"
was a great feature to me.</P>

<P>The efforts of World War II were the basis for most of the 
conveniences we enjoy today. Almost everything we consider everyday 
necessities were born during or as a result of that war. Television, 
cell phones, stereo discs, improved radio and radar – practically 
everything and anything electronically – computers probably being
one of the most common – had their beginning in that war. World
War II truly spawned an industrial revolution greater than anything 
the world had ever known. Without this war and the industrial 
revolution it generated, we would not have our precious computers, 
the Internet, and the open communication of today!</P>

<P>If you want to learn more about the birth of today's electronics,
or are a history buff, or a collector of war memorabilia or books, or 
perhaps you are a student or researcher in need of WWII material - 
then "Lightning Strikes" is indeed a great find.</P>
