<P>
Ezines are an industry of their own. Besides being a very
satisfying experience, publishing a newsletter can also be
a very lucrative business. Picture your ezine reaching
thousands of readers monthly, weekly, or even daily.</P>

exposure, and they are fully aware of it. Targeted subscribers
with a large circulation has a greater profit potential.</P>

<P>So you can see why companies are realizing that publishing an
email newsletter makes an excellent marketing tool, sales
device, and much more. Ezines give you an entry to gently
remind customers of your existence, keeping them updated on
what's new and maintain a favorable impression in their mind.
