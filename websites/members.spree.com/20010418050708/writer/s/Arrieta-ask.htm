<P>As a writer, you will practically run into people and ask them 
questions. In informal settings, you may or may not come 
prepared and may just do impromptu interviews. But in cases 
when you have to interview certain people, qualified people, 
or people specializing in the topic you're writing about, how 
do you go about interviewing him? Here are some pointers.</P>


<P>1. Make an appointment with your interviewee. You can do this 
by writing him a letter or calling him. When you make the 
appointment, always consider your interviewee's convenience.
Set a time and a place where your interviewee is least busy 
and most comfortable.</P>


<P>2. Always, always come prepared. Know your subject. Know 
his specialty.</P> 


<P>3. Know your interviewee. Know his background, his position, 
his personality, etc. You can do this by asking his friends and 
acquaintances or reading past articles about your interviewee.</P>


<P>4. If you have set an appointment with your interviewee, come 
on time. If you are meeting with him in a public place, it's better 
that you be the one to come early and wait than have your interviewee
be the one wait for you.</P>


<P>5. Know the questions you'll ask. Ask dumb questions, not stupid 
questions. Put yourself in your readers' shoes. They know little 
about what you're writing about but you know that they'll be 
interested in reading it. Ask questions you think your readers 
will ask your interviewee.</P>


<P>6. Always be courteous. Be interested in the subject.</P>


<P>7. Don't spend your time writing down everything your interviewee 
says. Learn how to pick up important points and jot them down. If 
you could, learn shorthand.</P>


<P>8. Never offer your opinion unless you are asked to by your 
interviewee. Keep in mind that you are there to listen and take 
notes, not to give your opinions and show how knowledgeable 
you are to your interviewee.</P>


<P>9. Maintain eye contact with your interviewee. Look directly into 
his eyes when talking to him. Give off the idea that you are direct, 
interested and sincere.</P>

<P>
10. Never ask questions that will embarrass your interviewee or 
put him on the spot.</P>


<P>11. Avoid close-ended questions. These are questions that are 
only answerable by either a "Yes" or a "No." When you ask your 
interviewee, he should be able to say more than a yes or no. Throw 
questions that will make your interviewee keep on talking and talking.
</P>

<P>12. If you are recording your interview, inform your interviewee 
at the beginning that you intend to tape your interview. Ask him if 
this is no problem with him.</P>


<P>13. Go over figures and names with him and make sure you get 
them right.</P>


<P>14. Inform your interview what publication and when your interview 
with him will appear.</P> 

<P>
15. Give your interviewee your contact number. Ask him if he would 
like to have a copy of the publication where the interview will be 
published.</P>


<P>16. Lastly, never fail to thank your interviewee at the end of the 
interview.</P>


<P>It is best to write your interview story immediately right after 
the interview. This way, the facts and your conversation with 
your interviewee are still fresh in your mind. </P>


<P>You should also determine what type of interview story you are 
writing -- a feature interview, an informative interview, an opinion 
interview or a combination of the three. The important thing is 
that you pick out all the pertinent materials in your interview. </P>


<P>You don't have to use all the materials in your interview, especially 
if you recorded it on tape. Use your good judgment in sifting 
through your material. Always ask yourself questions such as, 
"Does this information support and help build up my story?" or 
"Are my readers interested in knowing this bit of information?"</P>


<P>Be dynamic and descriptive in writing your interview story. Inject 
action; describe your interviewee's mannerisms and gestures. 
Show your readers his characteristic expressions.</P>


<P>Don't use direct quotes one after the other. Alternate it with your 
narration. When attributing, use words other than "said." Some 
words you can use: acknowledged, asserted, assumed, began, 
explained, exclaimed, feared, grinned, grumbled, hedged, hinted, 
implied, informed, insisted, protested. These are just some action 
words you can use to give your interviewee depth and action.</P>
