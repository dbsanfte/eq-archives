<P>	“Thank you.”</P>

                      <P>For many of us, it is an autonomic response. Like breathing, or
                      blinking, or crying during re-runs of Little House on the Prairie.  
</P>
                      <P>“Thank you” is a reflex action--a phrase we spurt out at the end of
                      a conversation, mostly to signal its end</P>. 

                      <P>I thank people for calling, for writing, for bagging my groceries, for
                      stopping me on the street to pet my dog. If you are like me, you
                      catch yourself uttering the phrase at least a dozen times each day,
                      but have you ever really stopped to think about what it means?
</P>
              <P>        In Mexico, it is “Gracias, Amigo.” During a recent month-long trip
                      to Mazatlan, that autonomic response thing of mine was going
                      strong. In fact, “Gracias, Amigo” is the single Spanish phrase I
                      mastered during my month-long visit. This was more because of my
                      limited bilingual abilities than because I really meant to thank
                      anyone. But, when you discover what the phrase really means,
                      “thank you” becomes a wonderfully appropriate response when you
                      find yourself speechless. </P>

                <P>      During that spring month of sunsets and sailboats, I would say
                      “Gracias, Amigo” to the green parrots who peered from the resort’s
                      lush greenery and mimicked whatever I said; “Gracias, Amiga” to
                      the round-faced girl who dodged heavy-footed tourists to sell me
                      spearmint chewing gum; and “Gracias, Amigo” to the Pulmonia
                      driver, though he careened around strolling pedestrians and through
                      clogged intersections at a breakneck, maniacal speed, finally forcing
                      me to nearly choke on that chewing gum.</P>

                    <P>  I soon learned that a “Gracias, Amigo” and a genuine smile can get
                      you anything--or get you help with anything--in this foreign land. It
                      became my favorite expression, mostly because the origin, the true
                      meaning of the “thank you,” is more obvious in its Spanish
                      translation.</P>

                      <P>Gracias. It’s all about grace. It means: I don’t deserve this, but you
                      did it for me anyway. I don’t deserve your help finding my way
                      around in a foreign country, but you helped me anyway. I don’t
                      deserve the time you spend bagging my groceries--I’ve done
                      nothing for you--but you bagged my groceries anyway. 
</P>
                 <P>     And the “Amigo” part is important, too. I smile on a culture in which
                      everyone from uniformed schoolgirls to straw hat vendors calls you
                      (who is, of course, really a stranger rattling about in their country) a
                      friend. This is their autonomic response, it seems. I couldn’t always
                      tell what they were asking me, but I always picked up the “Amiga”
                      at the end. What a terrific etymological partner for “Gracias.” After
                      all, sometimes we don’t deserve our friends, but a good many of
                      them stick around anyway. </P>
<P>
                      My husband and I say “thank you” a lot, and I don’t ever want to let
                      that go. Because “thank you” means I don’t deserve you, but you’re
                      here anyway. I don’t deserve your willingness to deal with my
                      smelly socks, my chocolate cravings, or my coffee pot paranoia (did
                      I unplug that thing or not?) but you’re willing to deal with them
                      anyway. </P>

               <P>       The urge to say gracias...thank you...is a natural outgrowth of what
                      that syrupy sentimental part of me calls true love. The kind of love
                      in which each partner encourages the other to do and to be
                      everything they want to do and to be. </P>

                      <P>This kind of love has nothing to do with levying expectations for this
                      partner to do something they wouldn’t choose to do on their own. It
                      is reserved for the mature, the wise, and the secure because it
                      involves no demands, no obligations, no expectations, no ultimatums.
</P>
                     <P> Naturally, this is not a new concept. More than one psychotherapist
                      has molded a multi-million dollar deal out of the idea. Best-selling
                      books, such as Scott Peck’s <I><U>A Road Less Traveled</U></I>, and Wayne
                      Dyer’s <U><I>Your Erroneous Zones</I></U>, are just a couple of examples. Not
                      to mention that old book called The Bible, probably responsible for
                      starting it all.</P> 

                      <P>So, the idea is not new, but it wields enormous power. Try it and
                      see. Say thank you to someone. Not because they took out the
                      garbage or cleaned the litter box or fixed your carburetor. But
                      because they didn’t have to.</P>
