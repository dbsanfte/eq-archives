<P align=justify>The old storyteller waved the campfire smoke away from his face and grinned
at the audience of campers.
<BR><P align=justify>"And that is the way it was back then." he finished his tale.
 <BR><P align=justify>Smiles and head nods of approval made its rounds, but the glowering eyes of
one guest caught his eye. The young man from New York had been a pain in his
side all evening with his sarcasm and skeptical remarks. The old man frowned
then shrugged, couldn't make them all happy it seemed. The night's
entertainment finished he stood up shaking hands with the departing guests
bidding them all a goodnight, but as he turned for his own tent he noticed
the New Yorker was still sitting.  He paused then addressed the man with a
set frown.
<BR><P align=justify>"Night's storytelling is over and I see that you are less that satisfied.
What is it that you are waiting for?"
<BR><P align=justify>"I am still waiting for a story that is worth listening to." The New Yorker
smirked with disdain. "All I have heard all night is folklore and wives
tales. Surely you can do better than that. I mean you are supposed to be
something of a legend with your tall tales. I want my money's worth."
<BR><P align=justify>The old man's frown deepened then he took his place back at the fire.
"Alright." he returned evenly. "What kind of a story do you think would be
worth your time and money on this trip?"
<BR><P align=justify>"I don't know." The young man retorted. "You're the storyteller and it is
your job to tell stories that satisfy your campers. So far I am not
satisfied."
<BR><P align=justify>The old man leaned back in his chair watching the smoke of the dying fire
drift on the night's breeze. The sighing in the pines made a lonesome sound
accenting the hard glitter of the cold star fires flashing overhead. After a
moment he fixed his wizened gaze upon the man across from him and smiled.
"Fair enough." he replied agreeably. "I am going to tell you a story that is
true. A tale never told to a mixed gathering or with children in earshot and
one reserved only for hard asses such as you. Now this story has a special
price and it can be paid for in either one of two ways. One; you listen and
if you believe the tale you pay a hundred dollar bill. Or two; you doubt the
story and as a consequence you spend the remainder of the night by yourself
in the place where the story took place and if you survive I will pay you a
hundred dollar bill."
<BR><P align=justify>The New Yorker narrowed his eyes. "So where did this tale happen?"
<BR><P align=justify>The old man grinned. "Just beyond that hill yonder.  Not far, but far enough
that no one will hear your screams if you decide to call this a bluff."
<BR><P align=justify>"And you are willing to bet a hundred bucks that you can scare me off with
your faery tale?" the younger man grinned.
<BR><P align=justify>The storyteller nodded. "Not much of a bet really. You see I am confident
enough that my money is safe, because if you call me on this you won't be
around in the morning to collect it."
<BR><P align=justify>The younger man studied the old man's face across the fire looking for any
sign that he was being scammed. The storyteller returned the gaze evenly
with eyes of ice reflecting the coals of the dying fire. After a moment he
grinned nervously and removed his wallet.
<BR><P align=justify>"Hell this is ridiculous, but I can use an extra hundred bucks! Put your
money where your mouth is old man and let's hear your best."
<BR><P align=justify>Each of the two men placed a crisp one hundred-dollar bill beneath a rock to
safeguard against the night wind and both settled in the darkness. The old
man slowly packed his pipe and set fire with a wooden kitchen match struck
on his boot top. After a moment he nodded satisfied that he had it going and
looked at his remaining guest.
<BR><P align=justify>"This is a true story and because of that I don't tell it very often. Fact
of the matter is that I am plum scared to tell it.  You see this is the
story of a dreadful haunt, a ghost or spirit as you may call them and as
such, she wanders about these hills at night listening for those foolhardy
enough to tell her tale. She's out there in the dark even as I speak and
since I am putting this to words we are both now in peril."
<BR><P align=justify>The listener snickered and the old man shot him a look akin to twin daggers.
<BR><P align=justify>"I wouldn't scoff until you heard the tale. The last two who did that were
never seen again and I damned nearly was done in myself before I could beat
feet out of here. We were three that night, tonight we are only two."
<BR><P align=justify>A chill went up the listener's spine and he turned in uneasiness at a
scurrying sound rustling a bush close by.
<BR><P align=justify>"Don't look!" the old man hissed. "Christ man! You will get us both killed
before I even get the tale unwove!"
<BR><P align=justify>The New Yorker frowned but nodded wiping at perspiration filming his upper
lip despite the cooling night air. Satisfied the storyteller settled a
little closer to the fire and lowered his voice to a near whisper yet
keeping it audible to the listener.
<BR><P align=justify>"Alright, a hundred years ago a Scotsman brought his bride into these hills
to build her a castle. He had struck it rich in the silver mines hereabouts
and wanted her to have a place that reminded her of home so she wouldn't be
homesick. The White and Indian folks up here thought she was a witch because
she collected wild herbs and sang songs in a strange chanting language that
called in the wildlife to feed right out of her hand. Well that Scotsman
first built her a cabin to stay in and then started on the castle. He
brought masons and carpenters from his homeland to build it and they started
setting the walls and foundations from the native stone of the hills. Nobody
hereabouts had any ideas about a mineral called lodestone back then but it
was a hard and serviceable building material ready to hand. Now that
particular stone has a pull on nature, you could even say that it calls out
to lightning. Every time they would lay a wall a few feet above their heads
a terrible lightning storm would gather and bolts of pure hellfire would
tear it down." He paused to draw on his pipe releasing the aromatic smoke to
the wind through tense lips.
<BR><P align=justify> "Locals in their pious religion saw this as a destruction from the lord
against works of the devil and set out against the Scotsman and his witch
bride, bedeviling them in every way to move out of the country. The old
Scotsman however was a stubborn man and set a hard face against them in
return. Controlling most of the money round these parts he made supplies and
the needs of the folks hard to get. With hardships fueling the growing
fears, anger went around enough to fill anyone's life with a nightmarish
hell. The locals riled the Indians against them and the Scotsman was killed
in a terrible killing. The red devils cut his heart out and hung it on a
pole before her front door with his mutilated body sprawled spread eagle in
the yard. The Scotsman's wife went mad with grief and the frightened workers
fled the country in fear of their lives."
<BR><P align=justify>The old man paused in his tale and stared out into the darkness as if he was
intently listening to a faint sound. The listener sat quietly straining his
ears and after a moment of detecting nothing other than the wind and a faint
cry of a coyote he cleared his throat and looked back at the storyteller.
<BR><P align=justify>"So that's it? That is your horrifying tale?" he grinned.
<BR><P align=justify>The old man slowly looked back at the young New Yorker across the fire and
silently shook his head.
 <BR><P align=justify>"No, fact is that was only the sad beginnings." he returned in a subdued
voice. "After the workers ran off no one ever saw the Scotsman's wife again.
They figured she had either been taken away with them when they left or she
had killed herself out of grief and buried somewhere up on that hill in an
unmarked grave. Point is, things settled down in this country for a while
and everyone was breathing easy, then the Indians from the tribe that had
done the killing began to disappear one by one. At first the disappearances
were chalked up as accidents or being killed and eaten by animals but it
kept on happening until so many had been lost that there was no doubts that
something terrible was afoot in these hills. The white folks round here
joined in with the remaining Indians and scoured the countryside looking for
the lost braves but nothing was found until a hunter strayed past the
remains of the ruined unfinished castle. There nailed to a tree were the
hearts of the missing men."
<BR><P align=justify>The old man stopped and raised his hand for silence, listening hard at the
sounds of the night around them. A pine creaked deep in the forest and far
off an owl hoot echoed through the darkness, the grass rustled and sighed in
the wind. The New Yorker nervously looked around at the darkness and then
quickly placed a few sticks of wood on the coals of the nearly dead fire,
stirring it into life. As the wood caught it popped and crackled, sending
firefly mites up to be caught by the wind and race away into oblivion.
<BR><P align=justify>"Ok, ok! What the hell are you listening for out there? Get on with your
damned story!"
<BR><P align=justify>The old man returned his gaze to the listener then leaned forward and tapped
the ashes from his pipe bowl out on a rock and into the small fire that was
now flickering feebly against the growing breeze. Placing the pipe back into
his pocket he studied the younger man's face.
<BR><P align=justify>"She's out there you know." he said in a flat voice. "Listening to every
word we say."
<BR><P align=justify>"Who is out there?" the younger man asked looking out at the night then back
to the old man. "You mean your ghost?" he forced a weak laugh that nearly
caught in his throat. "Bull, your just trying to scare me!"
<BR><P align=justify>The old man shook his head. "No, she is out there alright. I can feel her
hateful eyes on me."
<BR><P align=justify>Across the fire the younger man fidgeted, his eyes glowing with fear in the
wavering light. "Alright." He said in an unsteady tone. "Finish the story,
let's get this over with."
<BR><P align=justify>The storyteller shrugged. "Ok, but when I am finished and you go out there
to stay for the night be sure that you take a flashlight with you cause I
want you to see what I am about to tell you so you know I am telling the
truth."
<BR><P align=justify>He looked around one more time then tossed a few sticks of his own onto the
fire to give off a little more light.
<BR><P align=justify>"When the search parties returned with the hunter to the half built castle
they could quickly see that the work had been added to. Oh it wasn't the
neatly cut and shaped black stones that the workers had been using, but work
had continued none the less. The new courses of stone were simple river rock
picked up along the stream cemented in place with a crude reddish brown
mortar.  In fact as they searched the ruins for any signs of the murderer or
the missing bodies they noticed a sickly sweet odor about the place. They
found not hide nor hair of the missing men other than their hearts nailed to
the tree and not a clue to the identity of the fiend who had done the deed.
Praying the score had been settled the men retreated praying that all would
be well, but that was not to be the case." he let out a sigh and shivered
noticeably.
<BR><P align=justify>"What remained of the Indian tribe moved out in total fear of the witch
woman who they knew to be responsible, then it began on the white settlers.
One by one they began to disappear and as they did, the walls up at the old
castle grew. It wasn't long till the folks round these parts fled for their
lives never to return. That is why this country is so empty and lonesome to
this very day."
<BR><P align=justify>The New Yorker rubbed at his face and stared at the old man. "If any of that
crap is true why do you bring campers up here?" he asked suspiciously.
The old man shrugged. "Cause it is a good place to camp and safe enough as
long as nobody tells her story to rile her up or messes with her castle."
<BR><P align=justify>"You seen her castle yourself?" he asked quietly.
<BR><P align=justify>The storyteller nodded and stared at the fire as if he was remembering
something.
<BR><P align=justify>"Yes, the first time was just a few years ago. It was me who figured out the
reason the lightning had been knocking down the walls was because they were
made of lodestone. You see when I saw it, the walls were nearly finished and
I couldn't figure that out until I realized that the newer courses of stone
were not lodestone or magnetite but normal granite river rock. It was at
that time I made a grizzly discovery. The odd reddish brown mortar was hard
and glue like. After analyzing, it was found to be made of dried pulverized
bone, flesh and blood of human beings. I knew right then and there why no
one had ever found the missing bodies. She had been grinding them into
powder and using the blood to make the mortar in order for her to finish her
castle."
  <BR><P align=justify>The young man rubbed at his arms to fight off the cold damp feeling that
was taking over his body.
<BR><P align=justify>"Well, you said that all happened a hundred years ago so she must be long
gone by now." he returned in a weak half hearted hope. "Besides there is no
such thing as ghosts."
<BR><P align=justify>The old storyteller nodded his head. "Yeah that is what the two fellows from
New Jersey said last year. Remember I mentioned them before we started
 this."
<BR><P align=justify>"You mean the two you said disappeared." The younger man returned in a near
whisper.
<BR><P align=justify>The old man nodded. "That's right. They went up to the castle that night
after I finished my story and were never seen again. I went looking for them
come daylight, as I felt bad about it. There bigger than life was the ghost
woman mortaring more stones onto her walls. She saw me and I had to run for
my life to get away. I haven't been back up there since and never will be
again."
<BR><P align=justify>He stood up and stretched. "Well that is the story and it's all true. Give
me a minute and I will fetch a flashlight and point you to the trail that
leads up to the castle. I want to get into my tent before she starts in on
me for telling you her story."
   <BR><P align=justify>He left the young New Yorker for a few minutes while he retrieved the
light, but when he returned the scoffer was nowhere to be seen. Smiling the
storyteller bent down and retrieved the two one hundred-dollar bills and
placed them in his pocket.
<BR><P align=justify>"Damn I love those back east fellars!" he said with a grin as he headed back
to his tent and warm bedroll.
