<P>"Just forget it.  There's a one in a million chance we will EVER get
out of this place!"  Thus speaks the voice of conventional wisdom.
</P>
<P>"Then we still have a chance" speaks inspiration from the depth of
one soul.</P>

<P>The speaking soul is Ginger: a most surprising hero in the form of
the lead Chicken in the movie "Chicken Run".  Ginger had a vision.
Every chicken in her coop would be freed.  Safe from the possibility
of slaughter.  Not have to be worried about producing mass
quantities of eggs.  Not have to stay within the realms of their
fenced in, dirt floored existence.  Her vision was for the entire
community.  Not just herself.  Every chicken.</P>

<P>  Her goal appeared impossible.  Larger than life.  Her previous
attempts were valiant. At times  inspired.  Nonetheless, they
remained unsuccessful.  Stacks of errors in seas of trials.  To the
average thinker the conventional wisdom rang true.</P>

<P>Thankfully, Ginger held fast to her vision.  Just as many
inspirational leaders before her she drew people to her cause.  Her
fellow "cellmates" aligned themselves with her cause by using their
giftedness.  Together, they crafted a future that at one time
seemed nothing more than a pipedream of an "unreasonable"
leader.</P>

<P>Robert Anson Heinlein, author of Stranger in a Strange Land
reminds us of Ginger's lesson in stating "The reasonable man
adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in
trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress
depends on the unreasonable man."  Continuing to approach the
world from the perspective of an unreasonable person requires
having the courage to go against the flow of convention.</P>

<P>Laura tells the story of voting in her first Primary Election in
California in 1980.  The women at the booth asked the barely 18
year old first time voter, "Republican or Democrat, honey?"  Laura
looked at them and proudly proclaimed, "Democrat!"  The woman
handed her the forms and said, "Sweetie, you are too young to be
a Democrat" to which she replied, politely yet firmly, "No, I am
too young to be a Republican."  The registrar was surprised that
a sweet looking 18 year old young woman might vote opposite
her parents or the norm of her area.  The registrar was used to
conventional thinkers.  Maybe after meeting Laura that June day,
her perspective changed just a tiny bit.</P>

<P>Laura, like Ginger, could simply think no other way than directly
from her soul.  Not at all from a cookie cutter.</P>
<P>
For Ginger, as long as there was any flicker of hope no matter how
dim, there was still a reason to continue to seek the solution.  Even
with the odds at a million to one, the one was still there calling
her name.</P>
<P>
Inspirational wisdom brought out the collective genius in the
chicken coop.  Conventional wisdom sought to squelch it.</P>

<P>What brand of wisdom do you listen to most often?  Are you
allowing yourself to settle for second rate repeatedly?  Or are
you hearing the call of inspirational wisdom?</P>

<P>Is your answer a resounding "Yes!"?</P>

<P>Ginger, like French Playwright Jean Anouilh, knew what it meant
"To say yes, you have to sweat and roll up your sleeves and
plunge both hands into life up to the elbows. It's easy to say no,
even if it means dying."</P>
<P>
Say Yes.  Its a one in a million chance.  Yes!</P>
