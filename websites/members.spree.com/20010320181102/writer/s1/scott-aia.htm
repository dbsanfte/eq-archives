	<br><br><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow" COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+2">
<P>	Attraction, put quite simply, is that which draws together: people
or objects, ideas, products, opportunities..  Many commonly held
precepts are borne from this simple definition, such as "like
attracts like" and "bird of a feather, flock together."</P>

<P>Someone casually leaves a scrap of paper on the floor, soon 
there are multiple scraps of paper on the floor beside it.  Without
concerted effort, there will soon be a huge pile of scrap paper all
over the floor.</P>  

<P>It is seen in Junior High Schools across the world.  The kids who 
like this style of music all crowd together.  This lunch room table
is populated by kids in the computer club and that corner of the 
hallway is reserved for the jocks.</P>

<P>There were two women who began their careers at a pharmaceutical
company at the same time.  They had the same level of education.  
Their families were from neighboring communities in Suburban 
New York.  One of the women made an effort to attract positive 
people, attitudes and thoughts into her life.  She brought forth 
almost immediate success.</P>

<P>Her colleague, on the other hand, always thought negatively.  She
would say to herself, "There are lots of opportunities here at ABC
Pharmaceuticals BUT they would never promote me because I am 
too (insert your favorite negative attribute here).  People might 
talk positively, yet think negatively almost incessantly, feeding
the powerful subconscious a steady diet of negativity. </P> 

<P>The book of Proverbs reinforces the law of attraction by stating,
"As a man thinks, so is he."</P>

<P>What you think, you bring into your life.  Subconsciously or 
Consciously, you decide what invitations you send to the world.  
One step further, you even decide who or what is going to RSVP.</P>

<P>Make sure your guest list includes that which you WANT in your
life, rather than what you do NOT want in your life.  There are 
several simple steps to begin the process of attracting like a
magnet exactly what you want to attract.  By doing so, you will
naturally repel those people, situations, ideas away from yourself
as well.</P>

<P>1.  Be deliberate in your verbal language as well as your self-talk.
Listen carefully to what you tell yourself about yourself.  When 
you hear yourself saying something contrary, literally tell yourself
"STOP!" and replace it with a different belief, theory or reality.</P>  
<P>
2.  Spend time with people who also want to attract positive 
opportunities into their lives.  Have you ever noticed people who
focus whole heartedly on "Most people think X" and lament the 
horrors of "most people" or who complain or nitpick every small 
situation on the planet.  All day long these people are like a leaking
faucet dripping garbage.  And what do they attract? More garbage,
so they can continue to feed the drip.  Avoid them like the plague 
they produce!</P>

<P>3.  Take positive action, eliminate negative action.  Be sure your 
positive thoughts are matched by positive actions and positive 
habits.  You will come increasingly magnetic as all the components
work in harmony.</P>

<P>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow used the metaphor of an arrow and
gravity in his view of attraction: "If you would hit the mark, you 
must aim a little above it; Every arrow that flies feels the attraction
of earth." As you are experimenting with using your magnetism, 
simply aim high.  See what you bring forth.  Attract magnetically
and magnificently.</P>
