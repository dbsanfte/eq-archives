<img src="/writer/gif/design.gif"> Usually, the editor is right. Many writers complain to no end about editors, but if their
publication is doing well - then the editor must be doing something right. If they reject
your writing you should accept this as a good decision, and try to figure out why the
work was rejected.<br><br> 

<font color="#006400"><img src="/writer/gif/design.gif"> Fear is your enemy. Fear of failing will almost certainly guarantee your failure -
because you either will not try, or you will not give it your best effort.
<br><br>
 <font color="#b22222"><img src="/writer/gif/design.gif">Everything counts. When I get a letter or query from a prospective client that contains
errors in grammar, or spelling errors-it may well change my opinion of the writer. I may
even toss it in the trash. Neatness, correct formatting, following the editors guidelines,
spelling, punctuation, legibility, accuracy, all of these things are important. If you want
to be a professional writer you must act like one and present yourself as such.
<br><br>
 <font color="#00688b"><img src="/writer/gif/design.gif">Multiple submissions are smart business when appropriate.
<br><br>

<font color="#ee2c2c"><img src="/writer/gif/design.gif"> Don’t ask an editor if their readers would be interested in a certain subject. At this
point editors are the readers, so be direct and talk to them.
