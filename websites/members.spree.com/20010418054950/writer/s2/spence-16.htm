	<P>It is dangerous to assume that any book will sell on the
web. I do not want to put you off from potentially reaching
millions of readers. I am a firm believer in online
publishing. At the moment publishing on the web is still in
its infancy when compared to traditional print publishing,
therefore not all genres are currently being bought online.</P>

<P>This does not mean that you cannot sell your book if it
covers a genre that isn't selling well at the moment, it
just means you will have to work a little harder at
promoting it online. Do not worry, within the next 5 years
most if not all subjects will be bought online in similar
quantities.</P>

<P>So to find out if your book is suitable for online
publication checkout my checklist.</P>
<P>
16-POINT BOOK EVALUATION CHECKLIST</P>

<P>1. Book Quality - does your book solve someones problem,
show them how to do something in a unique way, or cover a
topic that no-one else has covered to date? This is
important because the fastest selling books online are "How
to" books. Over 85% of people online are looking for help
with something. If you are a fiction writer does your book
cover a subject that is popular online?</P>
<P>
Make sure your book is of the best production quality it can
be. If you have created an electronic book is it easily
navigable, have you spell checked it, does it have short
sharp paragraphs to make it more readable online?</P>

<P>2. Competition - who else is online selling the type of
books you write? Are they a famous name and therefore likely
to require you to work harder to get your name noticed? Is
your "How to" book cover the same subject thousands of other
are covering? If so, you will have a hard time getting it
sold.</P>

<P>3. Size of Readership - are there a sufficiently large
number of readers online who are interested in your topic to
make it all worthwhile for you financially.</P>

<P>4. Promotability - can you book be promoted at little or no-
cost to you? This ensures you maximise your profit on each
sale.</P>

<P>5. Price - have you set a realistic price? Many ebooks
online are selling at a ridiculously low price and therefore
failing to make the author a decent, and much deserved,
income. Price setting is the hardest thing to do when
selling books online. For more information take a look at
this pricing page http://www.getpub.com/myps/ </P>

<P>6. Supply Exclusivity - can you make your books available
from a limited source? This way you can keep your price
higher. If you are selling your books from a third party
website give them exclusive rights to the book for a limited
period, say 1 year. This will make them work harder for you.</P>

<P>7. Advantage for you to sell via the Web? - will your book
lend itself to being sold over the web? If it is in digital
format then the answer is Yes! If you only produce your
books in print, are the costs of distributing your book, to
potentially all over the world, going to eat into your
profits excessively?</P>

<P>8. Advantage for your reader to buy over the Web? - is it
advantageous for your readers to buy your books online? Can
you offer them a more competitive price, immediate download
of your book, convenience?</P>

<P>9. The Sizzle - can you sell the "sizzle not the steak" of
your book better online?</P>

<P>10. Reader Feedback - will the web help you to get better
feedback from your readers? This feedback can be invaluable
for your next book. Getting closer to your readers in this
way will help you to sell more books.</P>

<P>11. Legalities - can you legally sell your book online, or
does your existing publisher control the online rights? Many
do.</P>

<P>12. Cost of Distribution - can the web help you to
distribute your books more cheaply? This is where ebooks
really come into their own because they are distributed
direct to the reader online for next to zero cost.</P>

<P>13. Cost of Inventory - is it costing you money to store
your unsold printed books? This again is where ebooks come
to the rescue they cost nothing to store (other than taking
up some disk space on your computer).</P>

<P>14. Potential for Repeat Purchase - will the web offer you a
better opportunity to sell more than one book to the same
reader? Email can help you to keep your name in front of
your readers on a regular basis increasing the chances of
selling more.</P>

<P>15. Community - does the subject of your book lend itself to
being discussed in a community? You may be able to start an
email chat list, forum or newsletter based around the book.
More and more authors are doing this as a way of getting
closer to their readers.</P>

<P>16. And finally....Will it be fun for you? - if writing and
selling your books online is not fun then go and do
something else.</P>
