	<BR><I>"The Lord works out everything for his own ends-
	even the wicked for a day of disaster."(Proverbs 16: 4)
</I><BR>
	<STRONG>I.</STRONG><BR>
	<P>Standing in the upstairs hallway closet of the Harris' house, hidden behind the coats, I think: This isn't going to be easy.  I shall have to strangle the young lady without alerting other members of the household. Strangulation has to be  quick (God has told me so), particularly when it comes to girls like Sarah, who often talks to me of the twisted thing inside of her.  </P>
	<P>A tall thin twenty-one year old woman with  crazy blue eyes, raven hair that cascades sensuously down her back, a wonderful bust line, and gorgeous hips,  Sarah is beautiful beyond words.  I met her in one of my college classes about six months ago.  She's  bright.  But Sarah, I heard from friends, has the soul of the devil. "Just look into her eyes, " they say.  "Look into your souls," I say.  Her girls friends also fear her because they  believe she can read their thoughts. Former girlfriend Janet Rocker wouldn't go near her.  "Henry, you fuckin' little wimp, listen to me," she shouted at me once in a movie theater, "she reads my every thought. She told me what I was thinking about having for dinner the other night."  </P>
<P>Rumor has it that Sarah  was institutionalized years ago for killing her little brother on a lark-the family had gone fishing together when Sarah decided to see how long little Luke could hold his breath under water--and that her wealthy parents simply got her committed to the state hospital and released.   Whether the story is true or not, consensus has it that Sarah is evil, a spawn of Satan.  And consensus is truth.  Therefore, to combat evil, and possibly to protect myself, I have a God-ordained obligation to destroy Sarah. </P>
<BR><STRONG>II.</STRONG>
<BR>
<P>
	Getting into the Harris' house on Saturday night in late July was easy. Filled to the gills by Ma Harris' home cooking, I left two hours ago by the front door and re-entered an hour ago by the back door, which the family generally keeps locked. It was as if  I was meant to enter the house at that time.  Since the family gathered in the living room, for evening prayers I suspect (They're staunch Episcopalians), I crept up the back stairs, lugged myself down the interminable hall, and hid  in the closet behind some of the oldest, rattiest coats I have seen outside a Salvation Army store. I noticed that there was no air conditioning upstairs. I wondered if  God were giving me a sign.  
	
</P>
<P> I have been in the Harris household several times while visiting Sarah and have sat at several meals with her  folks.   While Sarah's dad is rich, very conscious of his powerful seat in county politics, he was cordial earlier this evening over lamb chops, rice, and pudding.   "I say, Henry," he said half-way through dinner in his high-pitched,  effeminate Victorian mode, "would you care for another chop?"   I nodded, remarked, "Don't mind if I do, sir, " and fork in hand dove for the plate stacked high with lamb chops in the middle of the table.  Of  English extraction, I have grown up in a house in which manners are very important  and pride myself upon my good breeding.  </P>
<P> While she can cook, Sarah's old lady is another bundle of twigs.   She loves to talk and prove that she knows more about a given topic than any one else. Thus, tonight, when I remarked that my parents just returned from Switzerland, where  I spent much of my childhood in a Catholic boys school, Mrs. Harris devoured the next hour talking about the Swiss as if she'd grown up with them. She commented, to the astounded look of her husband and daughter, that the table cloth and silverware were nineteenth century Swiss.  That's not all she said. "Did you know that most Swiss males have small penises, Henry?" she  asked, looking in her husband's direction, then towards me. Mr. Harris blushed beet red.  "Why, no, Mrs. Harris, I did not," I managed to reply while stuffing a huge portion of lamb chop into my mouth.   During the entire dinner,   wearing only a torn T-shirt and very tight shorts, Sarah said nothing, preferring to play with her food and watch  with a look of bored but malicious amusement.  Sarah laughed aloud only once, and that was when her mother made the reference to men's size. When she laughed, Sarah looked directly at me, and I am afraid that I blushed.  </P>
<P>  Several hours later, as  I sweat  in the upstairs  closet just off the long dark hall that runs to Sarah's bedroom,   I am tempted to use my energies upon Sarah's mother. However, I suspect Sarah will become like her mother, so killing one is like killing the other.    </P>
<BR><STRONG>III.</STRONG>
<BR>
<P>
Anyway, there shall  be no changing of minds.  Not this time. Nine months ago, the last time, I changed my mind and had to eliminate every member in the family. I'll tell you about it.  Always heavily medicated as they slept, Janet Rocker's folks-they got quite a kick out of mocking my infirmities--were sitting ducks: I  crept into the room, slowly mounted the bed, eased the rope around the old man's neck and then, in a swift powerful jerk,  cut off his air. He was dead inside five minutes.  The old lady never moved and kept snoring. Asleep on her back, Janet's mom  was the difficult one, for no sooner had I slipped the rope around her neck and begun to tighten it than she awoke with a "Gaaaak!" Making matters worse, she opened her eyes and kept them on me unblinking as I tightened the cord. It  took her forever to give up the ghost, her arms flailing like flippers to the end.  Feeling literally borne out of myself, I was  climbing down off the bed when  Janet stepped into the room.  Janet and I had had sex  hours before, and she believed that I had gone home. Rubbing sleep out of her eyes, she began with "I thought I heard something, Mom and Dad. Mom and Dad...? Mom?  Dad?  Oh, Henry!" Suddenly she blurted, now fully awake, "What are you doing in my parents' bed? What the hell are you doing here, Henry?"  Her words stopped me cold.  I saw her mouth open as she realized what had happened. (The mother's expression-eyes bulging in her head, mouth open in a stifled gaak -gave it away.)  "Oh, Henry," she gasped, "you little prick, you've murdered my parents! You have fucking murdered my fucking parents!!!" Taken  off-guard by her language, I murmured, "Why, yes, Janet, I believe I have. Sorry."  Seconds later, still euphoric from the kills, I sprang  at her like a cat, grabbing her long red hair and bearing her to the wooden floor with a thud.  Janet fought like a wildcat, screaming, biting, and scratching until I put my hands around her throat, told her that I loved her, and squeezed.   Like her mother, Janet died with one of those ghastly expressions that  belong on  late night horror shows specializing in '50's classics. When I got off  Janet, I looked up to see Little Earl standing in the doorway.  Little Earl had his catcher's mitt on and was wearing the baseball cap I had given him earlier that evening when I had boasted that I had played for the Detroit Tigers.  I liked Earl, and I might even have spared him had he not begun bellowing like a beast to be slaughtered.   I found the sound so unnerving that I actually considered running for my life.  Then I realized that Earl was only a ten  and was the only witness to the three murders.   Therefore, I took the logical step, leapt forward,  held Earl with one powerful arm and  put the rope around his neck with my free hand. Rope securely in place, and Earl far too weak to offer   resistance, I  tightened the noose quickly  with a "G'night, Little Earl."  I suspect Little Earl is now playing catch with the angels.  
</P>
<BR><STRONG>IV.</STRONG><BR>
<P>From a crack in the closet door, I  see down the dark hallway.  Because I've been in the closet for at least two hours, sweating like a pig,   I heard the parents talk about their nightly medications and saw them go to bed an hour ago.  I have been waiting for the light to go off in Sarah's bedroom.  Once it goes off, I'll give Sarah fifteen minutes.  She told me several nights ago that she  falls asleep rather quickly.</P>
<P>Finally, Sarah's light goes off, and I am drenched in sweat.  My breathing is perfect, however, and I  feel fit as a fiddle, capable of jumping over the moon.   In fact, I feel otherworldly standing in the closet, waiting for  the right moment;  feeling  borne out of myself in anticipation of the kill, I wonder if this is the sensation I shall experience once my soul leaves my body.</P>
<P>Closer to God I have never felt.   Exiting the closet, I move obliquely down the hall, dragging my left leg behind me.  I have learned, through years of practice (ever since the lawn mower accident when I was five) how to carry my dead leg so that, in most instances, it barely whispers over the carpet.</P>
<P>	The whisper is enough, however, and even before I reach   Sarah's room , I hear her  voice: "Dads, dads, is that you?  Dads?"</P>
<P>Startled, I pause, wonder if crab-like I should scuttle back down the hall, down the stairs, and out the door when I hear, "Just flush the toilet this time, Dads.  Last three nights, you forget to flush. Must be gettin' pretty old, I should think."  </P>
<P>	 
	Then slowly, slowly, I take one step forward, straining with my dead leg not to lose balance and not to bring my good foot down with a thud.  But I am tired and drenched and the only way I can move now is in sudden bursts, almost as if I am jumping forward; I have to do this not to  stagger. Thus, when my good foot hits the carpet, it does so with a slight thud. Then, of course, to prevent myself from sprawling, I grab my bad leg with both hands and lift it just so, placing the dead foot down on the carpet behind the good foot.  As I do so, the joints in my good leg pop. It sounds like a minor fire works display. I notice, simultaneously, that the July heat is almost stifling.
</P>
<P>
	"Dads, what in the world are you doing?" Sarah asks in that sing-song voice that I have  come to resent. "Dads, Dads, whatever are you doing?"  She asks the question with the same idiotic lilt with which she would ask me, at Burger King, "Are you going to have more fries, Henry?" or "Have you paid for our food, Henry?" It's the same lilt I heard in class when she proclaimed, "Shakespeare I know is England's greatest poet."  The lilt may win her friends with adults, but not with me.  I take it as an insult, a further indication of a  flawed character. (Besides,  I caught her imitating my limp to a group of her friends gathered around her car in the college parking lot the other day. They all roared with laughter.)
</P>
<P>"Dads!" she exclaims.  "Is that you? Is it Mummy?  It's not you, is it Dads? Is it? Is it?"  She sounds as if she's on the verge of  waking up the whole house, so I respond quickly. </P>
<P>	"Yes, dear sweet Sarah," I respond in a high-pitched,  effeminate voice that I hope sounds like Sarah's dad.  "Oh, yes, it is I.  I fear that I have lost my way in my very own house!"  </P>
<P>Silence ensues.  "Henry, is that you?" she asks, excitement and amusement  in her voice. I can hear her giggling.    "Oh, Henry!" she exclaims in an excited whisper. "Please, come in to my room.  Please, please do. Oh, Henry. Oh, hurry, do." I wonder if she expects me.  </P>
<P>Taking the rope out of my pocket and placing my good leg in front of my bad leg, I  move to her door, slowed a bit by the heat.  Since I hear nothing from her parents' room at the  end of the hall, I assume they are  asleep.  Likely nothing has been lost.  </P>
<P>"I'm coming, sweet cheeks," I say in  a whisper, dragging my leg. "I'm coming." </P>
<P>	"Oh, Henry!"  she chirps.</P>
<P>"Shouldn't we be a bit quiet, deary?" I query, halting my progress.  "Don't want to wake up the old folks, do we?"  </P>
<P>"Oh, Henry, Henry, Henry! Come right on in!" she exclaims, and I notice an odd tone in her voice.   </P>
<P>"Oh, Sarah," I say,  "Sarah, Sarah, Sarah. I am coming. I am coming."  The excitement from the anticipated kill is almost unbearable; I  understand why cats  kill mice.  </P>
<P>"Come quickly, quickly, if you can, my little man," she almost sings, and I  try to lengthen my stride and quicken my step.  Struggling a bit for breath, I don't remember the room being this far from the hall closet.  </P>
<P>"I come, I come," I say, quickening my limping pace-thud, thud, thud--and reaching the doorway.  Before entering, I pause, thanking the Good Lord for giving me this girl to do. </P>
<P>Then,  I push through the doorway with a magical "Aha!,"  my head darting quick as a snake's to the left, where I see Sarah's bed, empty save for a dozen teddy bears accumulated over the years. </P>	
	<P>	"What's this?!!" I  shout.  "What is going on here, Sarah?"  I quickly scan the entire room, look over her yellow  wall paper, wonder if she has simply disappeared into its design, and fail to see her. "Where are you, my lovely peach?" I whisper.   Dim light comes from a small lamp next to her bed. A small fan blows from the top of the dresser across the room.  This, I decide as I balance myself, is freaky. I know she is in the room, and my skin begins to feel ice cold. My hands tremble slightly. I think I am shriveling. I should have stayed in the closet. </P>
<P>
I begin hobbling in circles, scanning the room , looking for Sarah, wondering where she is hiding when I see her closet in the wall right next to the door and across the room from her bed.  Unless she is under the bed, which is unlikely, she has to be in there.  
</P>	
<P>	  
 
Thankful for the fan, I hold my breath and approach, cautiously dragging my leg behind me.    Stepping aside, flattening myself against the wall, I grab the door knob to the closet, slowly turn it, and push it open.  I wait for Sarah to emerge  when I hear a rushing from across the room and, glancing up, see a girl in yellow flowered pajamas pull herself away from the wall, raise a  small ax over her head with one hand, and fly right at me.  I see red glowing from her eyes, see her teeth angrily clenched, when I look up  to see the weapon's  descent.  "Say hello to your lovely peach," she says, ironic as always. Watching the ax fall  is like watching an outfielder catch a high fly ball in slow motion; it takes forever. 
</P>	
<P>The ax arcs straight toward the top of my forehead, the sharp steal touching my scalp, bone giving way as the metal passes through bone and into the brain. I open my mouth to bellow, but no sound comes out.  She has hit me  dead center in the forehead, just below my tangles of black curls, the penetration of the blade reminding me of the sound of chopping wood on a cold day in the Cotswolds.  Falling, thinking  "You Satanic little bitch,"  I look at her, see Sarah through red film.  Her yellow pajamas and her face are covered with blood, my own, I suspect.    </P>	
<P>My head split, numbness spreading  like a rash,  I sit in the middle of the floor,  my two legs spread out in front of me like dead logs.  My only relief is the cool air generated by the fan. Standing near me, Sarah puts her hands together, claps excitedly, jumps up and down, then bends over slightly, looks at me, smiles, says nothing.    I feel a warm, sticky fluid fill my eye sockets, spill over and run down the face; I see my own blood dripping freely onto the green carpet. </P>	
<BR><STRONG>IV.</STRONG><BR>
<P> I feel myself being rushed to death's door.  I am giddy, even a bit afraid. Still bleeding,  realizing my life has likely run it course,  I ask Sarah to give me confession, a ritual I have always cherished as a good Catholic.  I ask her as sweetly as possible.</P>	
<P> "A what?" she asks, stunned.  </P>	
<P> "A confession," I respond, weakly, for I feel I am quickly losing strength. </P>	
<P>"A confession?" she asks, amused.  I can't understand the question since I have explained confession to her on more than one occasion.</P>	
<P>"That's right," I respond, beginning to wheeze.  I am  feeling  cold and  want a blanket. "Would you give me confession?"</P>	
<P>"What ever for, Henry?" she asks .   </P>
<P>"So I can go to heaven," I respond.  For some reason, I envision myself playing catch with Little Earl.   Weakened by loss of blood, I lie on my back with a  sigh and look up at her motionless ceiling fan. "If you love me, you will do this." </P>
<P>She laughs. "Love you?" she asks, laughing sardonically. "Love you?!"  </P>
<P>
I bring my hand slowly to my face, feel sticky blood, and use my fingers to feel the blade implanted in my skull.  "Why the hell is that so funny?" I squeak, almost gone.  What little light is left around me is fading fast.  I feel myself shriveling. Prayer is futile, I think.  
</P>
<P>"Because," Sarah says,   bending over me so that she is looking directly into my eyes, "because, you fucking idiot, you're not going to Heaven.  Heaven is only for good people, you worm.  Oh, Henry," she laughed, "I think you must be going to Hell.  Oh, I say," she adds, in a booming voice, "I do hear that Hell is a mighty fine place!" </P>
<P>We pause and stare into each other's eyes.    I am too weak to do anything about her devilish mocking.   </P>
<P>"Is everything all right in there?" I hear a remote,  muffled voice from down the hall.  It's Sarah's mom, the old bundle of sticks.  </P>
<P>Not taking her eyes off me, Sarah calmly answers, "Yes, Mummy, everything is under control. Please go to bed."</P>
<P>"Are you sure?" comes the soft  voice, and I think of my own mother's always strident voice and am reminded  of how both my father and I buckle at her every  command.  I am  glad I am not going home tonight. </P>
<P>"Yes, Mummy, I'm sure," comes Sarah's reply,   leaving no room for doubt. "I'm quite, quite sure." </P>
<P> "OK, then, honey, I'll see you tomorrow. Your father and I will get you up for church around eight.   G'night."</P>
<P> "'Church sounds great," she says. "'Night, Mum." Sarah giggles when she says this, but I don't get the joke.</P>
<P>I lie on my back, gasping through sticky blood, and Sarah stands over me, arms crossed, smiling hugely. I watch the fan blow her raven hair.  What a pretty witch she is, I think.</P>
<P>"Those are some of the ugliest pajamas I have ever seen," I cough and spit. My voice gurgles.   I can think of nothing else to say to pass the time.</P>
<P>   "How did you know I was coming?" I gurgle, the room beginning to spin. I figured she might be psychic.  I had to know.</P>
<P>"I have the soul of the devil.  I thought you knew."</P>
<P>I lie on my back, speechless. I try forming words but can't.</P>
<P>She continues: "Since I met you, I'd prayed continually for this instant.  Tonight, as you sat across from me wolfing down your 'chops,' as Daddy like to call them,  and keeping your beady little rodent eyes on me, I knew.  I just knew. Satan told me so.  So I unlocked the back door, thinking this was the night when Henry the one-footed wonder might come hobbling down to my room. Bingo. One half-hour ago, you started your incredibly creepy walk down the hall. Jesus.  Kerthump-drag, kerthump-drag, kerthump-drag. That's how you sound. Fucking hopeless. So goddamned slow.   I knew it wasn't Daddy; I knew it had to be  Henry the fucking foot, as we call you around college. So I decided to play a little game.  And, since I always keep the ax right next to my bed, I decided to give you a surprise, you tiny prick."
</P>
<P>I look at her, blink, sensing an anti-climactic closure to my grim life.</P>
<P>"I didn't plan to put the ax into your head until you entered the room. I was just going to jump out and just swing at you.  But when you bounded into the room with that ugly limp, the twisted thing inside me jumped to life, and I decided it was time someone put you, you poor dumb animal, out of your misery.  It seemed purely  logical. A thing to do, like driving to the corner drug store. So, voila," she exclaims, shrugging her shoulders, "the old ax-in-the-head routine."</P>
<P>The old ax-in-the-head routine, huh?  Crazy as she is, I still like Sarah.  </P>
<P>She bends close to me.  "When you're gone, I'm going to cut you open and eat your  heart." She smacks her lips at this.</P>
<P>I begin to wonder where Sarah and I shall  go from here when I feel myself slowly at first, then more rapidly dropping away, Sarah's face growing smaller and smaller, almost minute.  I am falling.</P>
<P>"Good night, sweet prince," I hear her say, melodically. </P>
<P>Realizing that my evening has badly backfired, I feel finally that I am lying at the bottom of a huge leaden vase, floating upon a lake and looking upward at the tiny opening, seeking Sarah's face, wanting to hear that "Oh, Henry!" one more time.  I wonder if I shall feel her cutting me open. </P>
<P> I hear an old-fashioned furnace ignite,  feel the water getting warmer by the split second, see flames lick through the darkness out of the corner of my eyes. This  must be the mighty fine place Sarah was talking about, I think, and clearing my throat call out loudly and distinctly, "Little Earl?  I say, Little Earl?  Are you down here?"  I wait for what seems to be an eternity but receive no answer.  I know Little Earl is probably still playing catch with the angels, something that is probably not going to be an option for me.  </P>
<P>I sit up and glance around. I am on a lake, and for as far as I can see the leaden, stagnant water is dotted by fires, some large, others small.    I can hear cries and moans from a thousand voices, yet I have no idea where anyone is.  In the distance, an infinite distance perhaps, I hear a prolonged screaming and wonder, curiously, if it is my own. Lying back on the lake of fire, I know that I have had better nights than this one. Certainly, Hell is no place to spend Saturday night. Perhaps, when Sarah arrives-and she will be here eventually--things will improve.</P>
