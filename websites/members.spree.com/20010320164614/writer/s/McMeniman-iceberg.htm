<P>Have you been driving on the highway and abruptly realized
you missed your exit? You know you haven't been sleeping
because you didn't force anyone off the road. Or did you?
What's the matter, don't remember? How can you drive a car
without even thinking about it?</P>

<P>The answer to this question lies within our sub-conscious
mind. Our mind can be as deadly to us as the infamous
iceberg that sank the Titanic - or as helpful as that
instinct that warns of impending danger. Which would you
choose?</P>

<P>Picture an iceberg in your mind's eye. If you have never
seen one, an ice cube will work. As an iceberg floats, how
much of it is above the water? The answer - about 12%. That
leaves nearly 88% under water.</P>

<P>The manner in which the human mind operates is very similar
to these percentages. The 12% above water is our Conscious
Mind - it controls those daily decisions we have never
encountered before - new situations requiring inspection,
contemplation, deliberation and decision making based on the
available data and the values we hold dear.</P>

<P>The 88% under water can be compared to our sub-conscious
mind.  It decides how we behave in all our familiar
situations. Skeptical? Well, let's review just how many
decisions you make to start the day.</P>

<P>When you awake, what part of your body moves first? On which
side of the bed do you roll out? Do you kiss your spouse or
visit the bathroom first? Shower first or take care of other
things? In the shower, do you wash first or shampoo? Do you
clean behind your ears? Do you rinse with soothing HOT water
or invigorating COLD? Which towel do you use to dry off? How
do you hang it when you are done? Etc., etc., etc.
Most of us do not realize that we make literally HUNDREDS of
decisions before we have left the house in the morning - and
we haven't even mentioned deciding what to wear! The great
majority of these decisions are made by our sub-conscious
mind without us even thinking about the process.</P>

<P>So what relevance does this have to you? How you make daily
decisions determines your behavior, which, in turn decides
your direction and hence, the results you achieve. Allowing
our sub-conscious mind to make our decisions for us means we
rely solely on the quality of the Habits, Routines and
Programs which drive our sub-conscious mind.</P>

<P>If those habits, routines and programs are supportive of our
goals, then success will follow. If any of them are
contradictory to our desired goals or our values, we will
end up 'lost in life' - and very frustrated - often not even
knowing why.</P>

<P>I met with a group of professionals recently in which Sue
said she had a great career, working for a great company, a
good family life but still felt "Trapped." Why is that? It
could be that the life she has created, as successful as it
is, is actually in contradiction to the values she holds
dear. She may have unknowingly let her sub-conscious mind
decide her life for her.</P>
<P>
To overcome this dilemma in your life, there are three steps
to take. First, you must force yourself to become AWARE of
the process you use to make decisions. Only through
self-awareness can any of us learn how we have gotten to
where we are. The challenge is that our sub-conscious mind
will actually work against us. It likes our lives to be
constant, predictable, stable - able to run its programs at
will. We must ask ourselves at the end of every day, "What
did I learn about myself today?"</P>
<P>
Secondly, we must ACCEPT what we learn. In 1990, a 360?
Feedback Evaluation revealed that I was a 'Domineering,
Driven, Egocentric, Taskmaster!' I initially had some
trouble accepting this discovery, but, after honest
reflection, I knew it was accurate. Only after I accepted
this objective feedback was I able to accept the 'perceived
reality' of how I behaved with my peers, and how they didn't
like it.</P>

<P>After Awareness & Acceptance has taken place, ACTION can
commence. What actions you take will obviously depend on
what you need to change. Understand, the change process will
take a great deal of time and effort.</P>

<P>The change process is similar to the Y2K effort currently
underway around the world. We must find every 'line of code'
which works against us and make a Conscious Decision to do
something different. In effect, we must change the 'code'
which drives our mind.</P>

<P>An Iceberg floats in the ocean, slave to the forces of
nature. We do not have to be slaves to forces impacting our
lives. We can be different. We do not have to drift
aimlessly wondering where we will be next week, next month
or next year. We can choose to become aware of our
situations, accept what we find and take action to live our
life with gusto - thus avoiding the Iceberg just waiting to
'sink our life.'</P>
