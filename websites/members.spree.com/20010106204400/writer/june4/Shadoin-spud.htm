<P>Spud James was the youngest of Daisy James' four boys. You probably
know
Daisy real well. Now she runs Daisy's Hwy. 66 Cafe in Rock Creek,
across
the road from Clem's Feed Store. The Locals find their way into
Daisy's
every morning for the best biscuits and gravy for hundreds of miles
around. Each of Daisy's boys grew up with fine features, straight
blond
hair, cut across the brow, long even noses, strong shoulders and
upright
postures.</P>

<P>Daisy's first husband Bud drove a logging truck that prowled the
hills
above Rock Creek bringing down the timber. It was the winter of
1965
when Bud stopped his truck to help an elderly couple from Canada
who
were just passing through. They had pulled to the side of the road
and
had gotten stuck in the snow. As he was pushing them out, a fellow
logger at the wheel of a heavy load, couldn't slow down in time.
His
truck slid out of control and crushed Bud badly. Bud James died
three
days later in the hospital at the state capitol.</P>

<P>Spud James had been just learning to talk when the accident
occurred.
Within days of his father's death he quit trying to learn. He
regressed
into himself and never spoke another word.  It was easy to see his
father's sudden departure made little sense to the child.</P>

<P>Now, ten years later, Spud is a bright and personable sixth grader.
He
smiles, plays with his friends, is kind to strangers, and he is
still
silent. Sure he claps and whistles and makes other noises, but he
refuses to speak. Back when he was six, Daisy took him to the same
hospital where his daddy died.  The specialist there assured her
that
there was nothing physically wrong with her fourth boy. He could
probably speak as well as anyone, but chose not to. The doctor
thought
he might be able to help if he could keep Spud a while, but Daisy
would
have none of that.</P>

<P>Daisy tried everything from whippings to bribery to get that boy to
speak. The boy would simply look at her with his beautiful clear
blue
eyes pleading for his mother to understand, and finally she did.
She
gave up trying to change him, and embraced him for who he was. Spud
blossomed into a fine little fellow. The folks in Rock Creek grew
so
used to not hearing Spud that they hardly took note of his silence.</P>

<P>His teachers, especially the young and eager ones, would take turns
trying to get him to speak or sing or hum, but he would look at
them too
with those expressive blue eyes and all they could say even in
silence.
If the new teacher didn't begin to understand, Spud's old teachers
would
take the well meaning new ones aside and counsel and console them.
Everyone just took to his silence as naturally as he did. It fit
him
like his blond hair.</P>

<P>Clem Warden took a strong interest in Daisy James and her four
boys.
Rock Creek has a band of fishing and hunting buddies that go by The
Locals.  Clem is the son of an original Local and his Feed Store is
where the Locals continue to meet every afternoon to make plans,
swap
lies and taste a bit of what Clem keeps under the counter.  Since
the
Locals met every morning in Daisy's cafe, they naturally watched
with
interest as Daisy's sons grew towards manhood.</P>

<P>Those folks from Canada Bud James had rescued owned a bit of stock
in
railroads and such. They felt such a powerful sorrow for Daisy and
the
James boys that they sold some of their stock to start a college
fund on
the boys' behalf. They had tried to give Daisy some money to tide
her
over until she could get back on her feet. She refused. The
Canadian
couple gave the money to Clem instead, with the express
instructions
that somehow he get the money into Daisy's hands.
Then the couple quietly dropped out of sight only to call Clem four
times a year to get the latest reports on how the boys are doing,
ready
at the drop of the hat to rush to any of their aid, much as any
guardian
angel would.</P>

<P>Daisy of course knew about the scholarship money, but she knew
nothing
of the continued involvement of the old couple. Clem knew enough
about
Daisy to keep his mouth shut too. The money left in Clem's care,
and a
little more contributed from the feed store, the hardware store,
the
barber, the plumber, and just about everyone else in town, was
pooled
together. It made quite a sum.</P>

<P>When Daisy finally spent the last of the money that the sale Bud's
undamaged log truck had   brought, she finally went to the bank to
see
about borrowing a little money until she could get a job and get
herself
and her boys straightened around properly. To her utter surprise,
the
bank was only too happy to loan her the money she requested, and
quite a
bit more besides. They were only too glad to loan her her own
money.</P>

<P>Every man and woman in Rock Creek knew Daisy to be a good mother
and
damn fine cook. Her fried chicken and buttermilk biscuits were
always
the first items gone from the potlucks held during the community's
Fourth of July picnic. The banker told her that she ought to
consider
opening a cafe. There was one for sale, across the highway from
Clem's
Feed Store, and it even had a small apartment attached in the back
where
the boys could come and go after school. She would be able to work
from
home, so to speak.</P>

<P>So that's what Daisy did. She kept her home of course, but she
raised
her boys from the cafe mostly. And all of the folks in town
frequented
the cafe. Some even took turns helping out when she got too busy.
In
it's first few months, if the apple pie was a little dry, no one
said a
word. They ate their dry pie, drank their overcooked coffee, smiled
a
big smile and paid the check, leaving a big tip. Daisy's confidence
grew, and so did her kitchen skills.</P>

<P>If you ask her now about those early days, she'll point at some of
her
regulars and tell whoever will listen that your friend aren't
really
your friends if they lie to you about how bad your pie really is.
Then
she'll get a big smile and go back to pouring the best coffee for
two
hundred
miles of two-lane highway.</P>

<P>Ten years after Bud's accident, Daisy's oldest son was going to
college
at a really fine school back east. He studied mechanical
engineering.
Her second son was set to graduate high school that Spring and
already
had been accepted to a prestigious college and hoped to study
medicine.
Her third son was doing pretty well in junior high. That brings us
back
to Spud.</P>
<P>
Spud at twelve was just the same as any other boy his age, except
he
never told a lie. He wrote a couple down, but he never told any. He
started sixth grade without great fanfare. As October rolled
around, the
baseball games gave way to basketball and football, both sports
never
particularly interested Spud. He found himself idling about the
feed
store, always careful to stay out of the way of the Locals when
they
crowded in. Clem enjoyed having him around. He would talk to the
boy,
not as a father to a son, but as an uncle to a favored nephew. They
could carry on great conversations, Clem doing all the talking and
Spud
answering in eye movements and hand expressions. They didn't
pretend to
be friends, they were friends.</P>
<P>
Clem had a stock of fine bamboo sticks, each split from a marvelous
length of bamboo. As his father had shown him how to use the tools
for
shaping the sticks into eight identical lengths, he now showed
Spud.
Together they were hand crafting a split bamboo fly-rod. Hours each
day
were spent shaping and shaving, gluing and wrapping, lacquering and
rubbing, until a superb nine foot rod was ready for a reel. Brass
seats
and sockets, single wrap eyes, and a hand turned reel set this rod
apart. It was more functional art than fly rod.</P>
<P>
After the rod was built, it was time to tie the flies. Clem
installed a
second vice opposite his own. Each worked at his own pace, creating
gossamer and hackle flies sure to tempt the most finicky trout.
Before
too long, it was April and the two made plans for an expedition up
to
Rock Creek, above the Railroad Trestle and beyond.</P>

<P>Even though the morning dawns frosted and chilled, neither
fisherman is
discouraged. The younger is far more eager than the elder, but the
elder
relishes this first fishing trip with a sanguine nostalgia,
remembering
the first time his own father took him fishing. Clem feels a
sadness in
his heart that it is he, and not the boy's own father, taking him
on
this first trip. Still, he is proud and glad to have the honor,
such is
his genuine affection for the silent lad. With abundant lunches
carefully packed by Daisy herself, they two are trundled out of the
cafe
with a "Be Careful! Catch lots of fish!" and a "Mind you listen to
Clem
now."</P>
<P>
An hour hike later, the fishermen are casting across frosty rocks
and
anticipating the first strike. The brilliant morning sun has lit up
the
hoar frosted country like millions of diamonds, making Clem and
Spud
squint from the intensity. Spud works his way upstream farther and
farther from Clem, questing for untried waters. He rounds the bend,
but
Clem can still keep an eye on him. The boy's rod and line betray
his
location over the top of the meadow that separates them.</P>

<P>A scream pierces the silence. Clem wheels in alarm. He searches for
the
boy. At first he can't see the rod. Then he sees it bent over and
straining against a nice fish. Clem rushes up the bank and cuts
across
the field to where he can watch the boy excitedly fighting a
sixteen
inch rainbow. Clem watches in silence. At this point, the boy must
learn
to do for himself. Spud brings the fish closer to the side.</P>

<P>When the moment is right, he drops down into a squat, holding his
rod
high, and bellies the beauty. He lifts it proudly from the water,
letting out an Indian yell that any Indian around would have been
proud
of.</P>

<P>"Nice fish there."</P>
<P>
The boy spins to show off his prize, one hand still filled with
rod, the
other with fish.
</P>
<P>"Wadja catch him on?"</P>

<P>"Redwing nymph," was the reply.</P>

<P>The impact of the words uttered by Spud were lost in momentary
admiration for the fish and the fisherman. Then Clem realized he
had
actually heard what Spud said. He shook his head to clear his eyes.</P>

<P>"What was that again?"</P>

<P>"Redwing nymph."</P>

<P>Now Spud too realizes that he had in fact replied.</P>

<P>"Is that so? One of yours or one of mine?"</P>

<P>"Mine.  I made it with an extra long pheasant hackle."</P>

<P>"Some fish. You going to keep it?"</P>

<P>"Naw, it's too nice to eat."</P>

<P>"Wanna keep fishing, or head on home?"</P>

<P>"I guess we better get home. Mom will probably want to know I
reckon."</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I reckon."  Clem grinned at Spud who was split from ear to
ear
with a grin of his own.</P>

<P>The two friends made their way back to the highway and walked along
it
into town. They have their heads down, not out of shame, but out of
conspiracy. When they arrive at the cafe, Daisy expresses concern
at
their early return.</P>

<P>"I hope he acted all right for you Clem. I didn't expect to see you
back
so soon."</P>
<P>
"He was perfectly fine Daisy, it's just a little too cold yet to
fish."</P>

<P>"Did you catch any?"</P>
<P>
"I didn't, but Spud caught one nice one."</P>

<P>Daisy turns to her son to see his hands. "How big was it Spud?"</P>

<P>"About fourteen inches Mom." Those are his first words in ten years
for
his mother.</P>

<P>"More like sixteen Daisy," interjects Clem, always the fisherman
and
ready to stretch the truth. He has forgotten that Daisy has been
ten
years since hearing her son speak with his own voice.</P>

<P>"Is that so?" says Daisy, sensing a fish story.</P>

<P>She too is temporarily oblivious to this historic moment, her
'fishing
lie' detector going off.  Then it hits her like a bolt. She grabs
ahold
of her youngest boy with a bear hug that nearly squeezes the
stuffing
out of him. Then she does the same to Clem. Then back to Spud. And
back
to Clem. She hugs them both at the same time, laughing and crying
and
squeezing them both. It gets so bad that the boys are fidgeting
from
embarrassment.</P>

<P>Clem quietly slips away when mother and son begin their first
conversation. He heads back to his feed store about the time the
first
Locals gather from their morning's own fishing. Each compares fish
stories and Clem admits he got skunked, to the great delight of
John the
Liar Clem does affirm that Spud's hand made rod with its handmade
fly
landed a sixteen inch rainbow. It's not in Clem's character for him
to
mention that Spud is now talking. The Locals don't ask. Why would
they?</P>

<P>Spud bursts into the store a short while later.</P>
<P>
"When can we go again Clem? And my mom says lunch is on her for the
rest
of the month."</P>

<P>"We'll go again real soon. And tell you mama I said thanks, but
it's not
necessary."</P>

<P>Spud is gone before any of the Locals take note of who was just
there
and talking.</P>

<P>"Did that boy just come in here and say something to you Clem? Was
that
Spud James? I thought that boy was mute. What the heck is going on
here
Clem?" John the Liar asks what every man is thinking.</P>

<P>Clem just smiles and shrugs his shoulders. He is finally persuaded
to
tell the whole story, but he places far too much emphasis on the
fish
than the speaking. He refuses to acknowledge he had more than a
small
influence on the whole matter. He asserts that the boy made the
rod,
tied the fly, and chose to answer the question. Clem just happened
to be
there. Even now, Clem downplays the importance of giving that boy
all of
his free time that winter.</P>

<P>Clem was on hand when Spud was his high school class Valedictorian.
He
only wiped his eyes a few times when Spud pointed him out and
thanked
him right there in front of everyone in town. Spud used his college
money to get a teaching degree. He teaches difficult children and
those
with learning disabilities. He also teaches them how to fish. Clem
helps
out too. And the two friends still fish together now, though not as
often as each would like.</P>

<P>Clem left money for lunch every day that month. Daisy put it in a
box
under the register. At the end of the month, she put it all in an
envelope and pressed into Clem's hand.</P>

<P>"God Bless you, Clem Warden. Thank you so very much."</P>

<P>Clem just walked out of the cafe, his hand was wiping his eyes at
the
road side. He wanted to make sure the coast was clear before he
went
back to work.</P>
