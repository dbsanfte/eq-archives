<CENTER><FONT size=5> Tips For Self Copy-Editing<BR><BR>

<FONT size=3>The fastest way to follow the suggestions shown is with your word processor. Use your
“find” feature and enter the following things.<BR><BR>

<FONT color="#7a378b">Do a search for “the”, have you misspelled it by typing in “their” or “there” ? Did you
mean to enter “There” and only entered “the”? How many times have you used “the” in
a single sentence?<BR><BR>
<FONT color="#ee7600">Check for adverbs that end in “ly” by typing in “ly” on your search feature. Adverbs
that end in ly are more likely to be “telling” words as opposed to “showing” words.
Instead of saying “Joe angrily threw his hat to the ground” try being more descriptive.
“Joe’s face was beet red, the veins at his temples and along his neck were bulging, as
he grasped the hat in his fist and hurled it to the ground”,  paints a better picture
doesn’t it?<BR><BR>
<FONT color="#458b00">Search for opening quotation marks. What verbs have you used in place of the word
“said”? You should replace as many of these as possible. Don’t fall to using verbs
such as “mused”, “quipped”, “cried” “yelled”, “laughed”. etc. Remember to show
instead of tell. Keep it simple and use “said” as much as possible.<BR><BR>
<FONT color="#ff4508">Do a search for double periods.<BR><BR>
<FONT color="#0000ff">Do a search for parentheses. These are often over used in places where a comma
would work.<BR><BR>
<FONT color="#00868b">Look for the word “that”. Try removing it from any sentence in which you find it and
see if the sentence doesn’t work just as well, or better.<BR><BR>
<FONT color="#8b6194">Try not to use connectives such as : but, so, and, because, then, however. Many times
where these appear you can use a period and end the sentence instead. Then capitalize
the next word - making two good sentences out of one clumsy one.<BR><BR>
<FONT color="#ee7621">Search for I. This is often overused and used in the wrong place as well. Should it be
me or I? Be sure to double check this.<BR><BR>
<FONT color="#8b0a50">Run a search on all the different pronouns. She, her, him, he, his, theirs, etc. Pronouns
can serve to confuse a reader - be sure to use names or otherwise clarify as much as
possible.<BR><BR>
<FONT color="#68228b">Search for your lead character’s name. How often do you see it? It should be
mentioned every 2-3 paragraphs.<BR><BR>
<BR>
