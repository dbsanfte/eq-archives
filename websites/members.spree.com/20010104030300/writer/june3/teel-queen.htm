	<P>We lived on the outskirts of society and where notoriously wild.  Rock and Roll shows still traveled in those days, but because of their subversivness were banned in most places.  As a result we were forced to work the more austere, remote corners of the country.  Underground clubs without names built alongside dingy whorehouses in red light districts all across this nation.  We each had criminal backgrounds of varying consequence, each of us where outcast, each of us where desperately grasping for any opportunity when The Solomon Grundy Band came along.  
</P>
<P>I had been sleeping in my tent, which I had intentionally set up exactly on the border of North and South Dakota so that I could sleep suspended between two states, when I was woken by the sound of their dilapidated bus sputtering to a stop on the other side of the highway.  I poked my head out, squinting my eyes against the early morning sun, and watched the commotion.  The small door at the front of the bus banged open and three ragged looking musicians leapt out.  You can always spot a musician, or at least I can.  Their clothes for one; though dirty, were incredibly bright and adorned with intricately sewn patterns, the sort of which you never see in the shops.  God knows where they find them.  I even knew which one was the drummer; the one flailing about wildly, leaping up and down and yelling frantic obscenities while the other two dragged the unconscious driver from the bus.  Tears ran from his eyes in an unbridled stream and he eventually collapsed to the asphalt in an overly dramatic fainting motion.  This is to say nothing negative of drummers; they are simply unable to contain themselves.  Cautiously, I emerged from my tent and crossed the highway.  The two musicians trying to help the driver were as oblivious to my approach as they were to the antics of the third.  They were bent over his body and saying prayers in foreign tongues while slapping him about the chest and face.  It would have been comical if not for their sincerity.  I stood by and watched silently for fear of disturbing their prayers.  This went on for several minutes before they bowed their heads and finally gave up.  The drummer was still out cold.  "How do you do?"  I asked, unable to think of anything better.  The two musicians where sitting cross-legged on the pavement and staring at their hands.  They looked bewildered and lost and my heart broke for them.  There was an extended moment of awkward silence before one of them finally looked up at me and gave a response.  "We are not good," he said flatly.                            </P>                                                                                                       


<P>That was how I came to meet the band: Solomon, Shorty, and Dess.  Solomon, the one who spoke to me, was the guitarist, composer, and iron fisted leader of the band.  He had long, dirty red hair and a handsome face crowned by penetrating crystal blue eyes.  Dess, the bass player, unable to speak through his grief, was introduced to me by Solomon, as was Shorty, the overexcited drummer, as he was still unconscious.  I introduced myself as Wesley, a name I had read at the end of a dew soaked letter I found on a highway and decided to keep, as good a name as any.  After a while Solomon and Dess and I set about to bury the driver whose name turned out to be Jonah.  They supposed it had been a heart attack, feasible, as he was obscenely overweight and heavy.  We dragged him under a bypass about a hundred yards from the bus and half-heartedly covered him with rocks and leaves.  Dess began to cry and Solomon said a few more prayers I couldn't understand.  When we returned to the bus Shorty was awake and full of questions.  "Sol, Sol, What the hell are we gonna do now man?  Whose gonna drive the bus?  How the hell are we gonna get out of here?" and so on.  I took this opportunity to offer my services although I had never driven anything larger than a broken down go-kart taken from an abandoned carnival, a faded memory.  They gracefully accepted my offer and promised to pay me immediately after their next performance in Bigmouth North Dakota, though no specifics where discussed.  I retrieved my pack containing all my worldly posessions from my tent, which had been my home, and left it there beside the highway meaning to return to it one day. For all I know it may still be there.  From then on out faith was the road under my wheels at every turning, lit by a tendency to go too far.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
</P>

<P>By the time we reached Bigmouth I was a fairly good driver though my companions had deduced my lack of experience behind the wheel.  Along the way they regaled me with tales of their recent hardships.  They had been traveling as a crew of six, including Jonah the driver and two roadies who had made off with several months worth of earnings and much of the bands equipment; presumably to pawn for money.  The band where still reeling from this betrayal and had not played a gig in many weaks.  They had driven penniless all the way from Texas, stealing gas and begging for food along the way, only to have their driver keel over dead when they where almost there.  I wondered silently how a man of his size could survive so long on so little food but refrained from asking out of respect.  "You'll find new roadies in Bigmouth," I assured them, "North Dakotans are by and large a trustworthy people."
</P>
<BR><hr><BR>
<P>I had a little money saved from my last job selling Christmas trees in Wyoming, and decided to buy lunch for my new employers as a gesture of my gratitude.   There was only one restaurant in Bigmouth, a town I knew well.  I parked the bus in front of the Horn of Plenty and we went inside.  The Horn was about half full but the locals were congregating around the bar.  We sat down at an isolated booth by a large window looking out onto Main St. The band where ravenous and ate without speaking which suited me fine.  We all had chitlins and gravy at the suggestion of our waitress who told us her name was Hope.  After the meal we bonded over several pitchers of beer, the way men do.  Solomon spoke eloquently of his music and determination to continue despite recent circumstances.  He warned me that life on the road with them would be hard and strange. The shadows outside began to gather as time slipped away without our noticing.  I paid the bill and tipped Hope a fiver, which is more than my usual custom.  Solomon told her about the show and she promised to try and make it although her shift didn't end for another hour.  "That's alright," he said, "we play a fairly long set."  At first I had thought her hair to be black but when she leaned over our table the sun hit it and I noticed it was really a dark shade of brown.  It's funny how sometimes a woman's beauty will hit you straight away like a slap in the face and sometimes is just sneaks up on you slowly, growing more potent every time you look.  That's the way it was with Hope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
</P>
<P>It took longer than anticipated to locate the venue, a small ramshackle nightclub on the outskirts of town.  It was called Tears in a Bucket, which struck me as being perfect.  I pulled around back and we quickly unloaded the sparse set of equipment the band had been left with.  I had sort of feared for the turnout of a rock and roll show in a town of this size, but was surprised to see a considerable crowd of about forty kids gathered in front of the stage. Solomon spoke briefly to the soundman, the lights went down, and the band began to play. The hum of the chatter in the room was instantly silenced and the people just coming down the stairs and into the club froze in their tracks as a multitude of jaws soundlessly dropped. Maybe I have exaggerated that in my mind as so often happens with the passing of time, but I don't think so.  In any event it was the strangest, most beautiful music I had ever heard in my whole sorry life.  There where no words to the songs, nor any singer as you might expect, but Solomon's melodys stretched out for miles, coming down on us in shimmering waves of sound that where cemented by Short's hypnotic drumming and Dess' gut rattling bass lines around which everthing revolved like planets around the sun.  The songs would seem to speed up and slow down as if they where being played underwater and then Solomon's guitar would build and tremble and fill every space possible in the tiny club and behind our eyes.  He never spoke a single word to the crowd.  When the lights came back up, hours later, there where about ten people, the bartender, the soundman, and myself included left in the audience.  It was like waking up. We were looking around at each other, blinking and smiling stupidly.  There seemed to be a communal bond between us because of what we had just witnessed.  I can't tell you why so many people left, or why that would continue to happen everywhere that they played in the years to come.  Perhaps it was just too much for them, sensory overload.  It doesn't matter.  Shorty was taking apart his kit; Dess and Solomon were moving about the small stage, wrapping up wires and preparing to reload.  I wanted to help them but my feet seemed to be frozen in place.  
</P>
<P>Hope broke my paralysis.  She walked right up to me and just stood there like an orphan cat.  At first I didn't recognize her, so drastic was the change in her appearance from the restaurant.  She wore a fancy blue dress, older that the hills, that emphasized her beauty but could not hide her country innocence. Her hair, which looked black but I knew wasn't, lay across her shoulders like melted chocolate; real combed, not finger combed.  Her eyes were glistening with tears, nearly glowing in the smoky darkness of the club.  They reminded me of the color the skies had been in Wyoming early in the morning, a matchless pure blue I had never expected to see anywhere else.  She had clearly been moved by the band's performance.  "It's like home." She said.  Her words were soft and wet with emotion but I didn't know what she meant.  "Yes, I know."  I said, feeling ignorant.  She just stood there with tears in her eyes, hugging herself as if she was cold, waiting for me to say something.  I've never been able to talk to woman.  I noticed she had some people with her, three young healthy looking men stealing glances at us.  I wondered if she wanted me to introduce them to the band.  She stunned me by reading my mind, the way my mother once did.  "You're wondering about those boys I'm with aren't you."  "No."  "They're my brothers.  They want to come with you when you leave," she said, blushing, "and so do I."                                                                                                                                                    
</P>
<BR><hr><BR>
<P>After the band had been paid and the equipment loaded, we all piled into the bus and headed back to the small house where Hope lived with her brothers.  She served us tea and homemade acorn bread while Derek, Matthew, and No Future talked about music with the band. As there was no furniture we all sat on the floor. Derek and Matthew were twins.  Once told this I never doubted it, though physically, they looked nothing alike.  Derek had a long blonde mane, baby-fine, which hung down to his chin when his small ears failed to hold it in place.  Matthews's head was shaved.  Derek was tall and lanky, very thin.  Matthew was about medium height, several inches shorter than his brother, and of a substantial build. But they acted alike.  They were very quiet, yet when they did speak, their mannerisms, hand movements, and facial expressions were like mirror images.  At twenty-six they were the oldest.  Hope was twenty, and No Future; a hard looking figure with spiky blonde hair and many tattoos, was only seventeen.  At some point the tea became liquor and the mood became festive.  We swapped stories of run-ins with Johnny Law and narrow escapes from death.  We traded the stories of our lives the way children trade baseball cards, letting go with a sigh.
</P>
<P>Taking turns in the quiet, subliminal way that they had, Derek and Matthew told us of their early upbringing in the middle class suburb of Green River, Iowa. They were the firstborn sons to Elizabeth and Colson Mercy. Their mother, whom they spoke of with a reverence unmatched by any holy man that I've encountered, was a teacher and a saint, and their father worked as an insurance salesman, a noble trade that had all but vanished in the intervening years. They admitted to committing wanton acts of willful violence for money in their youth told and told us of their difficulty finding work in Bigmouth due to their criminal records. They pleaded with Solomon to hire them on as roadies and allow for their younger brother and sister to come along without pay.  I could tell they where on the run and secretly admired them though I admit my attention wavered.  I could not keep my eyes nor my mind off Hope, who was sitting by the fireplace and sipping hot tea mixed with rum from a wooden bowl that was carved to resemble the shell of an ancient turtle.  She looked like a gypsy queen from some blackened clan of mysterious and romantic origin. I thought she must be a wandering Madonna blessing us with her presence or a weird angel momentarily distracted by the mad lives of strange little innocents.   I closed my eyes and imagined her wings as she flew through hell and made the damned souls swoon.
</P>
<P>I woke up in the middle of the night from a nightmare having to do with wild dogs breeding in the wombs of woman. I lay still for an unknowable amount of time and tried to remember where I was. My head ached dully and my bladder was full to bursting but I was paralyzed with fear and displacement.  Finally, unable to take the suspense any longer I retrieved a book of matches from my pack which was my also my pillow and struck one. In a flash I saw Hope hunkered down in a dark corner, surrounded by mice who seemed to be consuming her, and she was smiling at me with eyes that pierced straight through to my heart and froze it in mid-beat.  "Hope!" I gasped as the match burnt my thumb and I dropped it. I fumbled another match from the book and in a flash it was lit, but she was gone. I half-heartedly scanned the shadows for her, but apparently, she had only been an apparition, a thing that seems to be but isn't, except in the mind.  I almost believed it.  I made my way outside to piss into the cold North Dakota night and then went cautiously back to my place on the floor.  I stepped on something, Dess it turned out, and he let out a sharp grunt but didn't wake up.  I lit one more match to search for a blanket. The only one I saw was being used by Shorty but he had passed out well before me and I thought he probably wouldn't notice if it was gone.  I was wearing my clothes and moccasins but winter had come on when we weren't looking and the wind was blowing hard enough to carol in the eves. 
</P>
<P>Wrapped up tighter that a papoose in a stolen blanket I let bittersweet sleep take me where it would, though I hoped to be through with the wild dogs and woman eating mice.   
In the morning I woke to the sight of Hope walking away from me through rising steam like a ghost over a freshly baked blueberry cobbler.  I said "Thanks," but she must not of heard me, or if she did she walked back into the kitchen and didn't respond.  I didn't mind.  I woke the band and we ate a hot breakfast fit for kings. 
</P>

<P>I folded my stolen blanket, combed my hair with my fingers, and put my pack in the bus.  Derek and Matthew set about packing bags for themselves and their two siblings who were busily preparing the house for its long season of emptiness.  I could tell Solomon was growing impatient with the delay. He sat in a corner Indian-style, mumbling quietly to himself and scowling at Shorty and Dess who where loudly playing patty-cake and chanting something ridiculous. I didn't quite know what to do with myself.  The blissful intimacy of the night before had been replaced by an awkwardness like waking up married to a stranger. "We should go soon," said Sol finally, "we have a long road ahead of us."  This was true. I think it must be hard for people to leave their homes though I wouldn't know.
</P>
