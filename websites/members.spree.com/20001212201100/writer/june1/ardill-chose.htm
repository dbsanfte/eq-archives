	<b><P>When I was a kid, a country girl in a country town, we had two TV
stations and an old chunky beta video player. The guy from the
local squash courts would come around once a week in his mobile
video van and we would rush out excitedly to choose from the not
so vast array of 5 year old videos.
</P>

<P>The covers tattered and torn, the quality dismal, my siblings and
I would spend the afternoon stuck in front of the TV watching --
or at least trying make out images in the fuzz -- our latest finds.
</P>

<P>That's it -- that was TV, that was our entire viewing pleasure.
One country town commercial television station, one non commercial
station and fuzzy videos. And we did this other thing, called
playing outside, for most of the day.</P>


<P>In Australia, where I live, we've recently been introduced to the
pleasure of cable TV. That is, everyone except us. Where we live
there aren't any cables so we had to wait until they decided that
us folk of non-city dwellings could have a cancer dome instead
(read : satellite dish on the roof) in order to be awakened to the
delights of cable.</P>

<P>
We got our dish last Thursday, and along with it 30 channels on
the Australian cable network called Foxtel. I know to you folks in
the U.S. 30 channels probably isn't much but to me, this country
girl who's viewing pleasure has only barely risen from her days as
a child -- me oh my! THIRTY channels, it was a channel flick fest!</P>


<P>We've had our cable TV now for a week and three times already
there's been nothing on. I tell you, thirty channels and three
times I couldn't find a darn thing to watch. If my mother were
here she would send me outside and tell me to play.</P>


<P>Of course I could always have switched back over to the
commercial stations, but there's a certain guilt and rebellion
involved in that. I'm not paying $56 a month to have 30 channels
and then watch something else! Uh-uh not his mamma!</P>


<P>I was so excited to find out that along with our cable came
Nickelodeon, the kids channel that my U.S friends have told me so
much about. I envisaged a life of sitting on the lounge with my
hair in rollers, fluffy slippers firmly in place, eating bon-bons
while my two year old son sat blissfully contented in front of a
constant string of children's programming.</P>


<P>It so turns out that he's not all that interested, which blew my
plans for a life of bon-bon eating out of the water. So instead
we've been playing outside, colouring, painting and doing
children's craft activities -- my mother would be proud.</P>


<P>Then there's the other problem I have -- with 30 channels I spend
most of my time trying to work out what to watch. There's too many
options and the channel guide sits atop my entertainment unit
looming like a copy of 'War and Peace'. I have trouble just
finding today's date in it let alone actually sifting through
the entire days programming trying to find something to watch.</P>


<P>Never fear, in this world of hi-tech there are more options -- you
have additional means of determining what to watch -- there's the
little information button on the remote control that you can click
and it tells you what's on now and what's on next on all the
channels. There's also the menu button, which brings all that up
in full screen version and of course, you can log on to the
Internet and search there.</P>


<P>By the time I've located something for my viewing pleasure it's
already over and I have to start the routine again. I could spend
an entire day just looking for something to watch and never
actually watching a thing.</P>


<P>And so for $56 a month I've got thirty channels which on average
offer up nothing decent to watch at least three times a week, and
a 24 hour a day kids channel that my son's not even remotely
interested in despite my encouragement. I refuse to check the
commercial stations because the tight-wad in me won't allow it
and the same goes for turning on the radio. And I've got way too
many options, making this many choices in a day was something I
left behind when I left the workforce, and they paid me back
then, I'M paying the monthly fee for this pleasure.</P>

<P>
Today, while contemplating returning the dish on the roof to
where it came from something happened -- I noticed a button on
the 200 button remote that came with the little black box which
apparently causes the cable channels to function. It was a little
musical symbol and when I pressed it lo and behold, I was
presented with 14 pre-set music stations.</P>

<P>
No commercials, just non stop music -- my solution! I frantically
searched hoping that I'd find the kind of music I'd want to
listen to all day long and then I found it -- The Top 100, 24
hours a day! No choices, only one station I'm interested in.</P>


<P>My husband finds this amusing, that I would pay $56 a month to
listen to the radio, no images, no flashy graphics even.</P>


<P>Me? I'm simply choosing not to choose, it's just way too much
for this mamma to handle in an average bon-bon eating day!</P>
