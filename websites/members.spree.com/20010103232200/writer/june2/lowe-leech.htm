	 <P>"Are you sure it's safe to be over here?" my best friend Dustin asks me.  I peek     out from behind the bus seat we're sharing, leaning only far enough for my right eye to spy on the driver.
</P>	<P>"Yah, Miss Fortune never gets mad at me anyway," I answer back, playfully poking Dusty in the rib.  His light blonde hair catches the morning light in its curls, and I wish that my hair weren't so dark, like the color of our Black Labrador at home.
</P>	<P>I tug at my hair a bit roughly, hoping to make it grow longer so I can look more like a girl.  My mother likes to keep it this short, like a boy's cut, because she says it's easier to brush.  I always eye the bottles of "No More Tangles" at the grocery store, though, dreaming of the day when I'll have hair to untangle.
</P>	I begin to notice that the bottom of my little kindergarten-thighs are sticking to the seat, and I move around some to try to loosen its grip on me.  The seat does not budge, so I stand up.
	<P>Instantly, I realize the grave mistake of showing myself to Miss Fortune.  Earlier, because of certain boys' cooties, she had split the rows of seats down the aisle by sex: the boys on the left side of the bus and the girls on the right side.
	</P><P>I had dangerously crossed the gender line to sit with Dusty, and now I have unintentionally revealed my misbehavior.  I see Miss Fortune's dark brown eyes beneath her afro; her eyes are almost staring at me in the rear-view mirror.
</P>
<BR><hr><BR>
	
<P>The days of Miss Fortune and my good friend Dusty were over when I moved from my home in Victorian Village to a bigger house in Upper Arlington.  Victorian Village was not much like Arlington; the Village had beautiful old houses with rich owners, like Arlington, but the Village also had fallen down apartment buildings with shady characters for tenants.  And unlike Arlington, I experienced a wonderful childhood in Victorian Village; there, I walked barefoot with scabs and scars, I practiced riding a bike in my back alley, and I played on the monkey bars at Goodale Park.  I was a careless, lucky child. 
</P><P>It was in Arlington that self-consciousness leeched itself onto me.  The girls in my first grade class mostly all had blonde hair and big, pretty blue eyes; I was very different looking anyway, with one brown eye slightly larger than the other and a small nose.
	</P><P>But most importantly, I had rampant freckles up and down my arms.  I can't remember if a remark was made about the freckles, or if I was naturally just shy about them, but they were the part of myself I was most embarrassed about.
	</P>




<P>Every day in the first grade at my new school in Arlington, I wore the exact same sweater.  It did not matter the season; the sweater, with a knit rainbow on it and the letters "O.P." in the very front center of it, was constantly on me.  The sweater was worn to hide my freckles, which of course, made the fact that I was hiding something all the more conspicuous.  At my new school in Arlington, I was so self-conscious that the effects reverberated in my personality: I would refuse to speak in group-settings.  
</P>	<P>One winter day I had forgotten to sign my name on a piece of artwork and my teacher wanted to know to whom the picture belonged.  The class was sitting around in a circle, and I can still vividly remember one boy, Matt, sitting across from me with his legs folded Indian style.  Miss Gildersleeves, our teacher, held up my picture and asked the class whose it was.  Obviously it was somebody's, but I would not speak up to claim it.  I was frightened-frightened beyond the thought of a scary monster lurking beneath my bed at night-to raise my hand and have all attention drawn to me.  The artwork went unclaimed for the next month until I saw it sitting in the trashcan before heading out to recess one day.
</P>	I was so shy and withdrawn that even my Sunday school nun, Sister Betty, scolded me harshly for being reticent.  
	<P>"Bridget!" She snapped.   Sister Betty, a large woman with short dark hair, was on one of her normal Sunday rampages and this time it was because a girl in my class had vomited on the carpet.  Earlier, Sister Betty hadn't let her go to the bathroom to be sick.  
</P>	<P>"And you," she said, looking right at me, as I sat as low and cowardly as I could in my desk.  
</P>	<P>"Why don't you ever talk?" She was glowering now, the purplish-color of the skin on her face in stark contrast to the brown habit she was wearing.  I was so scared by this woman I couldn't even move my mouth to form the words of protest and anger boiling up within me.
</P>	<P>Sister Betty carried on with the rest of the class after that but I have no recollection of what took place in class that day after she embarrassed me.   I just holed up inside of myself then and zoned out everything.
</P>

<P>At the beginning of the third grade my dad surprised my younger sister, Natalie, and me by bringing us home an Australian Shepherd puppy.  It took us a few days to finally decide on the name for her but finally, my dad, who was pushing for the name "Mitzi," had what I'm sure was a rigged name selection: Natalie and I put our choice of names for the puppy in a hat and he did too.  I chose the name "Mittens" because she was black all over except for her feet, which were white like socks.   My dad shook up the hat and pulled the name "Mitzi."
</P>	<P>Mitzi grew into a gorgeous dog.  She was beautiful, with strong legs and a firm body.  My dad ran with her for two hours or so at the quarry nearby our house each morning.  She never put up a fight about it. 
</P>
<BR><hr><BR>
<P>In my fourth grade class I met my best friend ever.  Nora was one of those people who just stand out and sparkle in a crowd; through the course of our friendship, she has continuously captured both my heart and imagination.  She always knows the exact way to treat me; I think we were soul mates, if it's possible for friends to be.
</P>	<P>During a normal fall day's recess soon after Nora and I had met, some girls in my class made me cry (for which reasons I can no longer remember).  Even then, crying was a source of embarrassment for me.
</P>	<P>"Don't worry, Bridget," Nora said to me as she draped her arm around my small body.  "I promise I won't tell anybody you were crying."  This reassurance bought her my lasting friendship and trust because she never did tell anybody about my crying.
</P>	Our friendship and rapport developed rapidly; we had our own two minds that thought much alike.  Nora and I, as we grew older together, became tremendous tricksters.  We were always looking for a new victim to play our practical tricks on.  
	<P>In the winter of seventh grade Nora and I both had the same math teacher, Mr. Fronk.  This particular teacher, a tall lanky man with dark brown hair and a goofy personality, lived not far from me.  The weekend that my parents were out of town and my 23-year-old cousin Ian was watching me and my brother and sister, Nora spent the night and we decided it would be prime time to toilet paper the teacher's unsuspecting house.  Earlier that week we had gone grocery shopping with Nora's mom and bought 12 rolls of toilet paper, a carton of eggs and some shaving cream.
</P>	<P>"Please will you take us to Mr. Fronk's house tonight to T.P. him?" I asked Ian.  Ian, himself a wild child, had no qualms about taking us out into the dark night to rake up some muckus.  We packed up my parents' station wagon, threw my 7 year old sister in the back seat with us, and we slowly made our way over to The House. The car silently crept and parked a few houses down from Mr. Fronk's.  The headlights went out quietly.  Nora and I got the necessary items together in our gathered arms and were on our way to the unknown.  The prospect of getting caught, by Mr. Fronk or the police, was what made T.P.ing so enticing; we were so scandalous, or so we liked to think.

      <P>    During the spring of my fifth grade year, we bred Mitzi with another Australian Shepherd.  As a family, we had decided that it would be fun to have puppies running all around in our backyard and my parents secretly figured that it would also teach us some responsibility at the same time.  I now suspect that my parents went into this sort-of breeding business with the expectation of some type of monetary profit after it was all done.
<P>My dad drove Mitzi out to a farm somewhere in the Ohio country and dropped her off for the weekend; the plan was she would mate with the male dog that they had locked her into a barn with.  
 </P>        <P> Mitzi, being the stubborn dog that she sometimes could be, did not at first take kindly with the male dog, as this dog's owners told us.  It took quite a few days for the dog to convince her to mate.  By the end of the following weekend, we received a message on our answering machine from the owner of the male dog letting us know that Mitzi had in fact gotten pregnant and we could come pick her up.
 </P>         <P>Our excitement over Mitzi's pregnancy literally lasted all the way up to and through her tenuous labor.  We had put an old plastic sandbox in our living room and lined it with blankets and pillows to allow Mitzi to be comfortable while she gave birth.  Books were scattered about the house on how to take care of her during the pregnancy and labor and finally, on a date we did not record, her 10 puppies were born.  
</P>         <P>The puppies all came out in their own sacs and after each one was born, Mitzi would use her teeth to tear the sacs off so they could breathe on their own.  Each small life was so precious and beautiful to watch begin.  The puppies were the size of my elementary school-sized palm and were wet and gooey and whimpering.
  </P>        <P>In the confusion of the labor, though, Mitzi had forgotten to open one of her dog's sacs.  We didn't even notice until it was too late the next morning and the puppy had died without really being given a chance at life.  My dad threw the dead puppy into the trashcan outside of our house.
</P>
<BR><hr><BR>                                                                          

<P>In the ninth grade Nora moved to Pennsylvania.  Her dad had found a better job in Philadelphia and the house papers were signed in a matter of days; Nora was going to leave my life and laughs and dreams forever.  A few days before she was to leave, we rollerbladed to the 7-11 by her house.  We bought our flavored Slushies and sat on the store's curb.  I was the first to bring up her pending move.
 </P>          <P>"Do you think we'll still be friends even after you move?" I asked her bluntly. She didn't hesitate to answer, "I will always be your friend, Brigitte Bardot."  I put my head down so that she wouldn't see the tears, but intuitive as always, she knew I was crying.  "Norma, it's just going to be so hard . . ." 
</P><P>Years before, Nora's dad had given me the nickname Brigitte Bardot after the famous sex kitten.  Nora's name was quite like "Norma Jean," the pre-Marilyn Monroe, so we had perfect nicknames for each other.  Our conversation that hot afternoon soon, inevitably, led to small giggles and then to roaring laughter.  So our friendship was sealed and we knew we were destined to be friends forever, no matter the distance between us.
    </P>       <P>The day Nora moved to Philadelphia was a sad, teary day.  I rode my red mountain bike over to her house in the early morning and helped her pack her last belongings.  Her 


room-her empty room-was a hard thing to bear; this was a room of so many memories!  The calls to, and from, boys; the experiments with make-up and the modeling 
of clothes; the late-night giggles; the games of Truth or Dare, all memories made in this peach-colored room.  And to have to say goodbye, to give a loved lifetime such a formal farewell, was difficult.  
        </P>  <P>Her dad loaded the maroon Volvo station wagon with the last of their belongings 
and it was finally time to say goodbye.  I got up from the bench on their front porch and walked to the door of the car where Nora was nearest.  
  </P>       <P>We hugged for a moment, and the last thing I ever said to her while she lived in Arlington was, "Nora, you've been such a good friend."
</P>
                                                                 
<BR><hr><BR>

	
<P>On an early fall morning of my freshman year, I woke up to the sound of my dad's yells.  They sounded a mixture of scared, anxious and angry and I could tell he was somewhere outside because I knew my bedroom windows were open and his voice sounded quite distant.    
</P><P>"Goddamnit!" He yelled. "Aw, goddamnit!"  Somewhere in me I sensed exactly what was going on-or rather, had gone on-outside.  It was an intuitive feeling that over the years I have keenly been aware of.
</P><P>I thought of Mitzi and what a wonderful friend she had been to me through her years.  I remembered the times I would sneak out to her doghouse at the back of our house and really hug and love her.  I would say to her, mostly thinking out loud to myself, "You are my best friend, Mitzi."  Sometimes, when she would do something bad-perhaps not sit when I told her to do so-I would scold her.  
</P><P>"Bad girl, Mitzi!"  I would say to her.  And she knew exactly what I was saying, I'm sure of it.  She always knew what I was saying, which would make me feel horrible after the scolding.  Walking into the backdoor after turning my back on her out of anger is a feeling of guilt I can still remember.
</P><P>"Ah, that's it."   Now I realize how I know Mitzi is laying dead in the street we live on.  In my sleep, I must have heard the car's horn, or the car's squeal as it tried to stop in time.
</P><P>But that can't be my dog, my baby, lying in the street.  I must still be dreaming. Or imagining.  I just need to fall back asleep and when I wake up everything will be normal like it's supposed to be.
</P><P>The next conscious sound I hear, after perhaps an hour of being asleep, is my dad's knocking on my door.  A feeling of pure fear and dread runs through me and I scrunch my body, trying so hard to make it go away.  Are those tears on my pillowcase?
</P>
<BR><hr><BR>

<P>After returning from summer adventures out west in the Sierras, I was invited to a Back-to-School senior party by my friend Esther.  I was rather hesitant to go at first; the party did not interest me.  I wanted to instead sit at my desk in my yellow bedroom and surf the Internet.  But Esther had made me promise that I would be at the party so I had to go.  I decided that if I was going to go, then I was going to call my friend Claire and beg her to come with me.  Claire, the dear friend she is, responded happily to my invitation and a couple of minutes later I left with her for the party.
</P>	

<P>I had never been to Esther's house before so it took us a little time to find it, but when we did get there, I was not disappointed.  Little did I know whom I was about to meet inside.
</P>	<P>"Hi, my name's Jon," he said, as he extended his hand to me.  I was taken by his manners instantly.  I couldn't remember the last time a peer of mine had shaken hands with me.
</P>	<P>"Hi, I'm Bridget," I said back, as casually as I could.  I could not help but drink this boy up.  I just knew something was going to happen between the two of us.  Just felt it in my gut.  Or maybe it was the way my heart kept skipping beats every time he would look at me.
</P>	<P>This certain Jon was wearing black pants, a thrift-style shirt and two chain-link bracelets on his right wrist.  He had the cutest smile I had ever seen and his dimples were, to say the least, very attractive.  He was dark looking with black hair and big dark brown eyes.  I was enamored by him and needed to get to know him more than just as an acquaintance.
	</P>
	<P>I was at work one Saturday afternoon when my co-worker Chris told me that I had a phone call.  I took the phone from him with a suspicious look on my face.  Nobody ever called me at work.
</P>	<P>"What's your favorite color?"  The male caller asked me.  Who was this and why was he calling me?
</P>	<P>"Uhm, who is this?" I asked the voice on the other end.  He would not tell me what his name was, and was persistent in finding out my favorite color.
</P>	<P>I realized it was Jon, the boy who I had met at Esther's party.  I couldn't believe that he was calling me.  
</P>	<P>"Yellow's my favorite color, Jon," I said.  I caught Chris's eye and smiled with glee.  I had told Chris all about Jon ever since I first met him, so Chris was very aware of what this phone call meant to me.
</P>
	<P>I came home from school the next day to find a dozen yellow roses sitting on my bedroom desk.
</P>
<BR><hr><BR>

	

<P>On our first date, Jon took me to see the romantic movie "Hope Floats."  I remember him picking me up in his light blue two-door car and watching nervously as he walked up the front steps of my house out my front window.  
</P>	<P>After the movie, we went to the river where we sat down by the river's edge.  It was dark and chilly out so Jon brought out a blanket that he had in his trunk.  We lay on the blanket and stared up at the dim stars whose light reflected off of the river.  
</P>
<P>Occasionally he kissed me, which was just amazing.  I actually don't remember my first kiss with him, but I can recall easily the feeling I got when we kissed.
</P>	<P>The first time he told me he loved me was about three months into our relationship.  We were downstairs in an empty, dark basement of my friend's and it was 
past at least 2 in the morning.  We were curled up in a leather love seat and had been quiet for a while, mostly gazing at each other.  I had been thinking in my mind, over and over, "I love you, Jon.  I love you."  
</P><P>And then, as though he read my mind, he said, "I love you, Bridget." 
</P>
