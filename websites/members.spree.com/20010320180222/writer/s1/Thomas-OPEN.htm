	<P>Friday is judgment day, the day we tally our results for the week. If we've 
made visible progress toward our goals, Friday is a good news day. If we 
haven't produced results, Friday is a bad news day -- one that produces worry 
and anxiety until Monday arrives with another chance for success.
</P>
<P>This past Friday looked like a bad news day for me. I had submitted my 
workbook, "An Adventure of the Mind," to publishers three weeks before. I had 
no offers and no signs of interest to show for my efforts -- and, like all 
writers, the more I waited the more I feared rejection.</P>

<P>"What can I do to produce some quick results?"</P>

<P>"Celebrate," was my heart's response.</P>

<P>"There's nothing to celebrate!" I yelled. "That's the problem!"</P>

<P>"But you still want to celebrate," my heart said, and it was true. I didn't 
want to face another long weekend of worry.</P>

<P>"Will the Dictionary Game* help me?" I decided to find out.</P>

<P>First, I compiled a list of words that mean "to celebrate." I used my synonym 
dictionary and thesaurus to do it, and here's the list I came up with:
<BR>
Applaud<BR>
Cheer<BR>
Favor<BR>
Admire<BR>
Endorse<BR>
Commend<BR>
Praise<BR>
Esteem<BR>
Revere<BR>
Honor<BR>
Bless<BR>
Notice<BR>
Proclaim<BR>
Promote<BR>
Publish</P>

<P>Next, I played the Dictionary Game with my list of words. The Dictionary Game 
is a new mind-body-spirit tool that helps you focus on your wishes and make 
them manifest. Here's how it works: With enough focus, the feelings behind 
your wishes are activated, or animated. When feelings are animated, they're 
able to attract other feelings just like them until they form a mass. When a 
mass is formed . . . it becomes visible in our physical world. That's the 
goal of all mind-body-spirit work . . . to make your feelings, your wishes, 
and your desires visible . . . and the Dictionary Game allows you to 
accomplish it.</P>

<P>I played the Dictionary Game by looking up the definitions of the words I 
compiled. To play the Dictionary Game with me now, just read along with me.

These were the words I needed to hear! Within minutes after playing my 
Dictionary Game, I felt like calling one of the editors who was reviewing my 
book. I got a great reception! He said, "I've read it. I like it. I haven't 
made a decision yet though. Can I have until Monday to give you something?" 
It was more encouragement than I had ever received from an editor, and my 
good news didn't stop there. An hour later, I walked to the post office in 
our little village to pick up my mail. In my box was an unexpected check for 
$800. Bob and I went to our favorite Chinese restaurant for lunch to 
celebrate our good news and we took the rest of the day off to plan a 
relaxing, worry-free weekend.</P>

<P>Go after the things you need! Some of your results will arrive right away and 
some will take a little longer, but with the Dictionary Game you'll find a 
new way to make things happen . . . a way that brings lots of good news.
</P>

<P>*The Dictionary Game is an important new spiritual tool that enables you to 
hold your focus long enough for your wishes to manifest. It's the tool 
spiritual students have been struggling to find, that provides the missing 
link in spiritual work. The Dictionary Game is featured in Mindzine, an 
e-magazine devoted to the power of words to develop the spiritual mind. To 
subscribe to Mindzine, mailto: mindzine-request@mindadventures.com (leave the 
subject line blank and type the word "subscribe" in the body of the message).
</P>
<P>Mary Anne Thomas is the author of "An Adventure of the Mind," a new spiritual 
workbook that teaches you how to manifest your dreams using mental and 
spiritual tools rather than physical effort. It's the true story of her own 
adventure with her husband following the death of their son, as they decided 
to find more powerful, more spiritual ways to live. Find "An Adventure of the 
Mind" as well as free articles that teach the wonders of creating with the 
mind at http://www.mindadventures.com</P>
