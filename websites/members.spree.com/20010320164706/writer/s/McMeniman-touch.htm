		<P>It was early labor, you know the easy part (compared to what
comes later) and Kay was experiencing first hand what her
'trying to be helpful friends' had warned her about, the
pain of your first childbirth. Her 'trying to be helpful'
husband was massaging her ankles and feet when suddenly he
hears, delivered with a low, but not unpleasant growl, "I
would prefer if you didn't touch me!"</P>

<P>Kay has been my wife for over twelve years.  Through those
years we have developed a close and intimate relationship.
We can even know what each other is thinking...sometimes.
In new situations, this 'telepathy' tends to breakdown,
since each of us is trying to digest the plethora (I love
that word) of new information bombarding our senses.  Our
first child being born was definitely one of those new
situations.</P>

<P>Has today's business environment put you and your co-workers
in new situations?  Has the chemistry that you seemed to
have developed over the years recently broken down?  Do you
now feel as if you don't know what anyone wants anymore,
even yourself?  This is a normal reaction to the changing
world around us.  Do not fear, you are normal.</P>

<P>In my communication seminars, we define communication not as
an act of one person conversing with another, but rather,
base the definition on the result of the exchange.  Simply
put, we define communication as mutual understanding.
Without this critical connection between the 'sender' and
the 'receiver', what has been accomplished?  In my opinion,
very little.</P>

<P>Think back to the last time you thought the person you spoke
to understood what you meant.  With this assumption of
understanding, you probably walked away with a warm and
fuzzy feeling that all was well.  Only to discover, minutes,
hours or even days later that what you had desired was not
only never done, but worse, the 'receiver' had done exactly
what you had warned them not to do!  You did not have
'mutual understanding.'</P>

<P>Our normal reaction at this point is to think about how
stupid, ignorant or inept the 'receiver' was to not have
understood such simple directions.    Is this true?  Have
you ever felt frustration towards another person when a
request was not fulfilled?  Have you ever felt like you
could hit them over the head?</P>

<P>My message is a simple one; whose fault is it if a receiver
of a message that you sent does not understand it?  How much
control does the 'receiver' have over how the message is
phrased, enunciated and emphasized?  The answer is none!
The task of the 'receiver' is to listen to the best of their
ability to any delivered message.  Then, they must interpret
it through the use of their internal thought processes,
language studies and experience and try to determine what
you meant.  Quite a daunting task.</P>

<P>My challenge is to those 'senders' of messages out there who
are frustrated by poor listeners.  I suggest you pause
before you speak and think about whom you are sending a
message to and ask yourself, 'How can I phrase my message so
it is most easily understood by this person?'  If you pause
consciously before each time you speak for the next several
weeks, this will develop into a subconscious habit.  This
habit will do more to enhance the relationship with your
friends, co-workers and even your boss than anything I can
suggest.  Why?  Because any message you send will have a
greater chance of being mutually understood.</P>

<P>By the way, Kay's message to me was mutually understood.  I
didn't touch her again until she asked.  As a result, she
delivered John Franklin McMeniman, 6 pounds, 10 ounces and
21" long five hours later.  Now that was mutual
understanding.</P>
