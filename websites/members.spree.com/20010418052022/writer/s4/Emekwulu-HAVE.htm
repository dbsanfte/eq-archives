	<FONT FACE="Franklin Gothic Book" COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1">
	<P>Let me make one thing clear right from the beginning. I am not here to

condemn the commercial publishers. Rather I am here to tell the truth, the

whole truth, and nothing but the truth about what is happening in the

publishing industry as I know it.</P>



<B>The Whole Truth</B>

<P>

There is a revolution sweeping across the United States. This revolution is

gradually spilling into neighboring Canada, Great Britain adn other parts

of the world. Publishing companies are merging and chief executives of

these companies, literary agents, and other professionals are getting

interested in publishing their own books. What does this mean? It means

there is a growing interest in self-publishing. People are sick and tired

of their financial golas being determined by someone else on 12th Avenue of

the Americas somewhere in New York. People are tired of someone deciding

for them what should belong in the slushpile and what should not. What's

the result of all this? The result is a proliferation of self-publishers.

</P>

<P>By the year 2000, the number of self-publishers has been estimated to

40,000. The field of self-publishing is being invaded by men and women, old

and young. These are professionals and non-professionals. Who are we

talking about?<BR>

 university professors
<BR>
doctors
<BR>
accountants
<BR>
engineers
<BR>
psychologists
<BR>
musicians
<BR>
nurses
<BR>
educators
<BR>
board members
<BR>
diplomats
<BR>
war veterans and what have you.</P>


<P>
Having known who they are, therefore, we know where they are. They are in

colleges and universities, hospitals, financial institutions, high schools,

prison establishments and so on. These are people who are eager to

communicate their ideas, people who think they have a message, people who

want to see their message in print. These people, one might be tempted to

say, are found in big cities. No, they are everywhere. In fact, I have

received the same number of inquiries from people in urban areas as I have

from people in outlying areas. Some people need inspiration, motivation and

confidence to believe in their own ideas, the confidence to believe that

their own stories, experiences, training, education etc., can make a

difference in the lives of others. This time, not only the confidence to

self-publish, but also the confidence to write the book in the first place.
<BR>
This takes ut to the question:</P>



<B>Why Self-Publishing?</B>



<P>There are as many reasons as there are different shades of people who are

engaged in self-publishing. Some of the reasons include:<BR>



Turn around time is less<BR>

Visibility<BR>

Credibility<BR>

To accomplish a personal goal.
<BR>
To control one's destiny.
<BR>
Loss of faith in the verdict of the Giants.


</P>
<P>The commercial publishers take anywhere from six months to years to get a

book published. This is is not fair, if you want your book in a shorter

period of time. Therefore, doing it yourself changes the entire picture.

Exciting, isn't it?</P>


<P>
Self-publishing enhances visibility. People see your name on the front of

that book or those books as someone associated with the publishing

industry. It opens opportunities by way of speaking engagements, media

appearances etc.</P>



<p>Self-publishing brings credibility. You are seen as expert on whatever you

are trying to communicate and you are. For university professors,

self-publishing could be a road to getting over the "publish or perish"

syndrome. To some of them, self-publishing could be a road to tenureship.

Many self-published books have been picked up by commercial publishers

after they were initially self-published.</p>



<p>In the spring of 1983, 5,000 copies of "Don't Eat Your Heart Out" was

self-published by Joseph Piscatella, who was forced to change his eating

habits at 35 because of triple by-pass surgery. Within a month, the entire

edition sold out. The book was picked up by Workman Publishing Company

which printed 30,000 copies in their first edition. Since then more than

10,000 has been sold. Noman Dacey self-published "How To Avoid Probate" and

sold 10,000 copies before it was picked up by Crown Publishers. This

publisher ha since then sold more than a million copies.</p>



<P>Yes, to accomplish a personal goal. Some people resort to publshing a book

taht wouldn't have otherwise been published by the mainstream publishing

houses. It could be a family history, an autobiography, and so on. In such

cases, people publish such books and give them away to personal friends,

and family members or donate them to non-profit organizations for

fund-raising.</P>



<P>How many of you will like someone else to determine their financial

destiny? Do so by raising your hands. Self-publishing means control.

Control of not only the contents, but also control of yoru financial

future. Publishing your own book could mean an early retirement from your

regular job, but it is not guaranteed.</P>



<P>People have lost faith in the verdict of the New York Giants. In other

words, people are sick and tired of the censorship going on in the

publishing industry. There are examples of books that have been rejected by

the Giants but eventually became best-sellers. These examples include:

Elements of Style by E.B. White and One Minute Manager by Kenneth Blanchard

and Spencer Johnson to name a few.</P>



<P>I very much believe in the words of Dr. Rev. Robert Schuller of Crystal

Cathedral, Garden Grove, California when he said, "What do you believe in?"

and I say put it in writing. In his book, The Publish It Yourself Handbook,

Bill Henderson says, "The right to publish what you believe in is an

essential of any democracy. It is nto to be denied by any government, local

censorship or publishing conglomerates.</P>


<P>
As the interest in self-publishing grows, so do the needs of the

self-publisher and companies spring up to provide these needs. These

include magazines, newsletters, and services. Professional associations are

also springing up to protect the interest of the self-publisher. These

associations include Publishers Marketing Association (PMA), Mid-America

Publishers Association (MAPA), Small Press Association of North America

(SPAN) etc. Among other things, these associations provide cooperative

marketing opportunities for members. They hold annual conferences, seminars

and book fairs where members come together to exchange information and

other forms of intelligence. They also sponsor different book awards to

encourage excellence in different aspects of book publishing - cover

design, health, business, how-to, autobiography, biography etc.</P>



<P>These are distributors that are relentlessly helping the small publisher

put the published books into teh hands of the final consumer. These

distributors are developing interest in self-published books because of the

growing interest in the number of self-publishers and also because of the

recognition of small publishers by book editors of big national newspapers.

</P>
<P>
"Self-publishing is not for everyone," says Marilyn Ross, a self-publishing

expert. Am I saying that everone should self-publish? Absolutely not. If

you don't a need to you don't have to. Just write a book and look for a

publisher. Otherwise, self-publishing might be your best option.</P>

<P>Self-publishing is a way of business, is the business of the future, and

has come to stay.</P>


<B>
What does it take To Self-Publish?</B>



<P>Self-publishing is a club. It is an activity admired and practiced by a

group of highly motivated individuals who believe in their ideas.

Membership is open to anyone with talent, viewpoint, special knowledge,

education etc. to share with others. These are the requirements. If you

meet one of them, it is time to get your first book published. Membeship

does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sexual

orientation or political affiliation.</P>
