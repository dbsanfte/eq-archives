	<FONT FACE="comic sans ms" COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1">
	<P>What is the single most important tool which will cause your future 
to become filled with all your hopes, dreams and desires? The
Power of Goalsetting in your daily life.</P>


<P>There are two ways to look at the Power of Goalsetting.  You can
look from the perspective that setting Goals is like having the
strongest allegiance you could ever imagine having.   OR you can 
groan when you hear "Goalsetting" thinking it is for someone else,
can't possibly work for you.</P>


<P>Before you say either  "Never worked for me, never will" or "I have 
goal setting software I use everyday, I have my five year plan
mapped out to the Nth degree, I know exactly where I will be at 
11:05 am on June 14, 2003.  I know who I will be with and how I 
will get from here to there down to the tiniest segment of time."
take the time to read, ask questions and reflect.  Make your 
intention in reading this article to not just be about a goal setting
plan, but what lies underneath the plan.  What makes the plan
important? What blocked you from pursuing the  plan successfully
in the past?</P>

<P>
What is the challenge to using the Power of Goal Setting everyday?</P>


<P>Quite simply it is knowing both what it is you want to do as well as
why it is you want to do it.  Having a clear perspective means you
know where to shine the flashlight before you get to where you are
going.  If you have no idea where to shine the flashlight, you might 
as well be surrounded in fog.</P>


<P><EM>How to gain clarity?</EM></P>


<P>As a child, how did you learn about anything?  It all started with
asking questions.  To gain clarity of focus on your goals, enter 
into inquiry with yourself.  One option is to journal and then
reflect upon your responses.</P>

<P>
One word of caution: don't make this into some sort of a Christmas
Card annual greeting, create an inner conversation with depth and
meaning.</P>


<P>Listen to yourself on a core level without judgement rather than
on a "should, would, could" level.  Try this on for a moment.  See
how it works for you.</P>  


<P>Question:  "Why is this goal important to me? <BR>
Response: It is important to me because I really enjoy working with
XYZ"<BR>
Follow up Question: "How so?"<BR>
Response: "XYZ is so enjoyable to me because it reminds me of the
time when I was 1-2-3.  I was so alive and  invigorated then.  
Anything was possible!"<BR>
OR "I was so connected with my friends at that time!"<BR>
OR "Almost anything can fit here"</P>


<P>"Listen" to your responses with the technique of an archaeologist.
Get out your tools and dig into the meaning underneath your 
findings.  Don't expect it to come right away.  This is not a microwave
process, it is more akin to a slow cooker.</P>


<P>To actually begin the process to overcome your obstacles, there 
are some creative ways to bring more artistry into goal setting as 
well.   Are you  right brained-artistic rather than left brain- logical?
You may have  the mistaken belief that goal setting is a </P>chore.


<P>On the contrary, goal setting can be a dynamically imaginative.  
Perhaps this is a new paradigm for you.  The exploration will be 
intense whether you are a rookie or a pro-goal setter.</P>  


<P>The simplest way to begin is through brainstorming.  One of the 
most enjoyable and challenging ways to do this is to create a 
game of "Thinking in One Hundreds". There is power in a large 
number, a magnetism.  You have the ability to get there, too, if 
you will allow yourself to think freely.  Remember, no shoulds, 
coulds or oughts allowed!</P>


<P>Take a sheet of paper and a pencil (or open a document on your 
word processor if that is your preference).  Place a title on the 
paper--and it can be any of the following or others.  In fact, you
may want to have several sheets, and begin to engage your mind
in various places simultaneously:</P>


100 People I Will Meet Before I Die<BR>
100 Books I Will  Read in the Next Decade<BR>
100 Places I Will Visit <BR>
100 Questions I Will Ask About.........(Anything!)<BR>


<P>Once you get started, you will be well on your way to not only 
knowing more about yourself and why certain goals are important, 
you will learn how goal setting will work for you.  You might not
get up to 100 of any of the categories</P>.


<P>Let go of your perfectionistic past ideas about what goal setting
looks like or feels like according to old patterns and techniques.  
Allow yourself to create newly, listening to your true desires.  
Ponder what you found when you were focusing, gaining clarity.
Review your 100's lists, even if you never made it to 100.  Thats
perfectly fine.  It got your brain pumping, right? </P>


<P>There can be no "wrongs" except for not trying it at all.</P>
