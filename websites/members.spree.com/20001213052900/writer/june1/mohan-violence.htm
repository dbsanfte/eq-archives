	<P>I have been planning to write this article for a few months now, but time and again, my efforts to take to the writing console have been cut short by bouts of misplaced optimism.  Maybe, the last incident was a flash in the pan!  Surely this cannot be an epidemic!  This had to be the media hype!  It helps to up their network ratings, doesn't it?  The image of gun toting kids lusting for blood and terrorizing our schools cannot be a reality.  No, not in this country!  Why our kids?  Why the guns?  What are they fighting for?  Our children have everything that they could possibly dream of.  From toys to movies, from chocolates to candies, from Disneyland to the World of Safari; after years of painstaking toil, in this country called America, have we not created an idyllic paradise for our children?  
</P>
<P>Despite the constant ranting of my heart that seemed to stress on the contrary, my rational conscious continued to discount the gravity of the situation.  I would attribute each sordid event in this saga to the mental depravity of an individual - a singularly psychopathic and uniquely deranged youngster.  It was not a trend nor was it an epidemic as some had touted and I stood steadfast in my denial.  All until that fateful day when tragedy struck at Columbine High in Colorado!  That single calamity forever crystallized the flavor of my thoughts.  Optimism changed to cynicism that quickly metamorphosed to despair.  I finally realized that my dream of eternal bliss for the children of America was in serious peril.  Violence in our schools was not just a rare nightmare but a constant, diabolical reality!  
</P>
<P>What was disturbing in Columbine High, was the cold-blooded and premeditated nature of the executions.  The well-planned prologue and the ultimate bloody epilogue left everyone aghast.  This cannot be really happening! Something, somewhere in our midst, is terribly amiss!  In that moment of despair, I rallied for hope.  We can not let this great country of our dreams perish to rubble because of our senseless violence.  We owe it to our children and to all our succeeding generations.  I owed it to my six-month old and to millions of other to find the right answers. 
</P>
<P>My hope is to attempt to postulate some practical solutions through this article to end this destructive trend in our schools.  If not anything, I hope, as a minimum, to start a cerebral debate that might teach us some lessons, improvisations, mental adaptations, if you will, as we transition into the next century and into the new millennium.   It is the children of today that will shape the destiny of our civilization. Its fate, and the strength of all humanity, is tied with the course that we help chart for our kids.  The chosen path, of course, will be theirs, but the legacy, most definitely, should be ours.  
</P>
<P>I decided to unearth all the facts.  I mulled over everything that the experts had pontificated on.  I performed my own investigation of any reasonably plausible explanations.  A correct analysis required lack of bias and avoiding the pitfalls of superfluous explanations with quick-fix solutions.   Similarities between the different tragedies were explored to discern and dissect the common areas of concerns. 
</P>
<P><U><EM>Background</EM></U></P>

<P>This sordid saga came into national prominence with the school shooting at a suburb near Seattle in 1996.  What followed was a series of similar incidents in schools located in Mississippi, Kentucky, Arkansas, Oregon, Colorado, Oklahoma, and very recently in Michigan.  It was the massacre of fifteen innocent kids in an outwardly normal and erstwhile benign suburban area of Denver, Colorado that first jolted us to the grim realization that our schools were turning into killing fields.  The recent shooting by a six-year old in Michigan sent shock waves all over the country with both the public and the politicians seeking solutions to avert similar incidents in the future.  During the aftermath of these tragedies, experts were called in to possibly explain and provide answers to curb this growing menace of violence in our schools.  
</P>
<P>The post-mortem of the tragedies by these professed experts, however, amazed me.  Blame and a plethora of it was hurled in every possible direction, depending on the expertise of the pontificating authority.  The political angle of shirking responsibility, finding scapegoats, and simplifying problems to an easy quick fix could not have been more obvious. In the end, every aspect of our existence was analyzed and found wanting.  Despite, this extensive rigmarole of expert testimonies, there were no consensus whatsoever on any practical solution that could help alleviate this problem.
</P>
<P><U><EM>The Common Factors</EM></U></P>

<P>Frustrated with the expert psychoanalysis of the aftermath, disgusted with the unbecoming situation in our schools, and yearning for answers, I decided to seek the truth for myself.  I started with identifying and examining the common elements of all the shootings.  Both the personality of the individual(s) and the social environment of their existence were considered to help provide clues for defining the problem.
</P>
<P>It was boys with a certain distinct personality that carried out these shootings.  They were all low-key and quiet kids with good academic credentials.  They did not possess the athletic prowess, physical attributes, or the personality to make them popular with their peers.  In fact, they were often bullied and mocked because of their reserved disposition. Their family background was suspect.  Most of them came from dysfunctional families with either single parental units or divorced parents or had parents that were in the process of getting divorced.  Individual hobbies were distinctly similar.  These kids liked movies and video games that were sated with violence.  All these shootings took place in the quiet suburbs of our big cites or towns.  The locations had a distinct semi-rural or rural flavor.  Hunting was the popular pastime that bonded men in their community.  Therefore guns were fairly commonplace and relatively accessible.
</P>
<P>Now for the next stage of this analysis, I will endeavor to explain the recurrence of some or all of the above elements in these tragedies.  For if we can get to the right reasons, solutions will certainly be forthcoming.
</P>
<P><U><EM>The Root of the Problem</EM></U></P>

<P>The shootings were carried out by boys who were cast aside by society as an amorphous mass of inconsequence.  Mediocrity was their identity and lack of love defined their existence.  At home, they were ignored by their parents and at school, derided by their peers.  The main issue was their self worth.  These boys were craving attention but no adult in their life noticed anything amiss.  The parents were caught up in their own squabbles and/or in their own career pursuits.  The teachers, on the other hand, were engaged in their own survival at school to perceive the mental well being of their pupils. With parental attention nonexistent, these boys sought in the school and in their peers, self-gratification and self worth.  Unfortunately, in our schools, as in every facet of our contemporary society, glamour and attention are interchangeable.  These are exclusive prerogatives of sports celebrities, rock stars, and the desirable Adonis'.   These define the bastions of popularity and the trove of success.  If one does not qualify, one is naturally exempted and categorically belittled.  This was, regrettably, the fate of these boys.  Ignored at home and disregarded at school, they permeated frustration from every pore of their existence. The trenchcoat Mafia and the Goth cult symbolizes the accoutrements of a frustrated youth, that wanted to overcome mental and physical diffidence, with the power of violence.  The video games predicated on violence provided the ideal outlet for their pent-up frustration.  These coupled with the violent movies served to desensitize them to blood and gore, providing the perfect backdrop for the actual shootings. The semi-rural background with its communal passion for hunting not only introduced these boys to the art of killing but also provided easy access to guns.  The infatuation of some of these kids with Hitler, and the Nazi doctrine, although chilling, is nevertheless explicable.  Philosophies rooted in violence and hatred have always found good breeding ground in the morass of frustration.  Of course, the plethora of popular music and movies that propagate violence contribute to this predicament.   These kids were floundering and violence was their mantra for salvation. 
</P>
<P>These incidents of school shootings were acts of frustration, of defiance and anger. It was the retaliation by immature minds against the socially defined domains of popularity and success.  The use of guns on their hapless and unsuspecting victims provided the executors with the ultimate adrenaline rush.  It was, for these boys who were bereft of any self worth, the moment of instant gratification, of recognition that they so desperately craved.  It was this frustration and anger that was unleashed as the potent firepower of deadly bullets in each shooting.
</P>
<P><U><EM>The Solution</EM></U></P>

<P>So what needs to be done to pre-empt such senseless carnage in our educational institutions?  First and foremost is to acknowledge that this violence is for real.  The second thing is to accept some measure of responsibility.  We directly or indirectly shape our contemporary society.  If we love to take credit for a chunk of its spectacular achievements we should also take responsibility for some of its shortcomings.  The perpetrators and victims alike are products of the same illustrious society.  Their actions present a reflection of our attitudes.  Their follies paint a picture of our failures.  It will need moral fortitude and strength of character on our part to resolve this crisis and avert future tragedies.  It is my fervent hope that our schools shall once again be restored as the sanctum sanctorum of learning.
</P>
<P>To facilitate lucidity of thought and the brevity of plausible solutions, I have outlined the issues with their corresponding solutions. 
</P>

 <LI>Regulate Violence in the Media</LI>
 <LI>Renovate the School System</LI>
 <LI>The Role of Our Superstar Role models</LI>
 <LI>Improve Our Family Structure</LI>

<BR><BR>
<P><U><EM>Gun Control</EM></U></P>

<P>Gun control is an absolute must.  I am an advocate of total elimination of firearms from our civilian population.  Unlike some people, I do not believe that our freedom has any relevance to our right to bear arms.  The founding fathers gave us this right so that we could defend ourselves against invaders and oppressors.  With our well-entrenched democratic institutions, and the formidable might of our armed forces, we no longer need to wield the gun to defend our country or to shape it's future.  The argument that guns provide protection against criminals is fallacious.   When have you ever heard that possessing a gun saved the life of an unsuspecting victim?  If guns were such an effective deterrent, why do we have such a colossal problem with gun violence in our country?  Violence begets more violence.  Widespread availability of guns means an easier transition into violent acts associated with criminal behavior. 
</P>
<P>I do realize, however, that this would be a crushing blow to all the hunting aficionados.  To cater to the hunters amidst us, we could have gun rentals at the entrance to our parks.  The hunters would have the option to rent the choicest gun at a minimal cost and when they are done for the day, they would return the gun to the official caretaker.  
</P>
<P>Here is another option- one that would allow people to still keep their guns.  Under this alternative, the authorities should initiate a ban on the sale of handguns and any other firearm that is not related to hunting.  The child-safety lock mechanism that has recently been touted by the government could be a deterrent but its efficacy with respect to the teens and the pre-teens is suspect.  We should have a system that would require more thorough checks on individuals prior to the sale of any firearm.  There should be punitive measures initiated against parents or adults who are careless with firearms.  Selling guns to kids should entail in extended prison term.
</P>

<P><U><EM>Regulate Violence in the Media</EM></U></P>

<P>Which brings us to the next issue regarding our media.  We should initiate policies to restrict the propagation of this popular culture of blood and gore that is so lionized by our media.  The media should have more social responsibility than what they have demonstrated in recent years.  Our media and Hollywood moguls reiterate that their goal is to portray reality and that violence is a reality in our world.  If reality is so dear to their heart then why is there such a dearth of depiction of poverty and starvation, love and sacrifice in their esteemed productions?  Why do we have to glorify some realities and indemnify others?  
</P>
<P>We need to put a stop to this cult of blood and gore in the media.  One alternative is to impose regulatory checks to censure the contents of movies, music, and the television especially when catering to our children.  Virtual reality games that exalt blood and gore should be categorically ousted from the market.  The Internet should be controlled to stop mushrooming of web sites that advertise violence.  Similarly, access to web sites that provide detailed procedures for manufacturing bombs should be restricted.  I know that this may impinge on our freedom but when its exercise hurts our nation, it can no longer be justified.  If we are unable to promulgate effective regulations owing to red tape or legal or political bottlenecks, then it is we the people who will have to accomplish these objectives.  Parents, teachers, and all adults should boycott violent movies, music and the television shows to minimize exposure to blood and gore for our young ones.
</P>
<P><U><EM>Renovate the School System</EM></U></P> 

<P>Last but not the least; we need to refurbish our school system.  We have to start with the quality of our teachers.  It is imperative to improve the pay scales of our teachers so that teaching can be established as a viable profession for our educated elite.  Schools need to set up a support system for the youngsters. This should consist of some select teachers and peers to help our youngsters resolve their personal predicaments.  Our schools need more of empathy and less of the adversarial attitude that is currently prevalent between the students and their teachers.  Both the curriculum and the attitude in our schools have to be revised.  The curriculum should contain information about the various cultures, people, language, and religions of the world.  For it is only through education that we can teach our children to respect others, irrespective of their color or their ethnicity.  Tolerance and respect for individuals of a different color or race shall certainly be forthcoming, if we learn more about their culture. Our school system needs to reconstruct its attitude - to help each child find and foster his or her self worth.  Our schools should not gauge the worth of its children solely by their performance in sports and sciences.  There should be alternate avenues of recognition - one that encourage creativity and artistic proclivities.  Development of character and emphasis on morality should play an equally significant role.
</P>
<P><EM><U>The Role of Our Superstar Role Models</U></EM> </P> 

<P>What about our highly paid and thoroughly pampered, superstar role models?  We venerate them unconditionally and have come to forgive even their most despicable of truancies.  I think that it is time for a change!  We should not condone their action if it will, directly or indirectly, lead our youngsters to a path of violence and hatred.  Our role models should be accountable for their conduct. That should be an absolute pre-requisite prior to and during their tenure as the demigods of our contemporary culture.  This should be part of their contract that should be explicitly explained prior to their donning the garb of popularity.  If it is too burdensome or restrictive, then they can opt for the lifestyle of the common mortal, bereft of the adulation and devoid of the opulence.  There should be stiff penalties, both monetary and otherwise, for deviant behavior.  If we are to pay our sports, music, and movie stars millions of dollars and shower them with a lavish life style befitting kings, we should certainly be entitled to a significantly more ethical conduct than what we have witnessed lately.  For it is these superstar role models that are the trailblazers for our children and who help shape our children's proclivities.
</P>
<P><U><EM>Improve our Family Structure</EM></U></P>

<P>It is imperative that we improve the quality of our family relationships.  Our family structure went through rapid decline during the latter half of the preceding century.  It continues to deteriorate from bad to worse with each advancing year.  Single parents, increasing divorces, more mothers in the workplace, loss of extended family, spousal and child abuse are all factors that have individually and collectively rendered our family structure decrepit.  The foremost amongst these, however, has been our own disposition - the focus on us with abject disregard for our children.  The erosion of our families has not been more apparent than in this generation of the baby boomers.  This apparent lack of cohesive family units has led to growing neglect of our children.  In total frustration, seeking attention, and seething with anger, some of these neglected kids resort to violence and guns.  We need to re-establish our family units as the support center for our kids.  Every member of this family unit should be accountable to the rest for his or her actions.  This will entail making some sacrifices.  For starters, to give our children our total and unconditional commitment.  Our personal desires should come after we are through taking care of our kids.  It is that special care and attention that only parents can provide which can effectively eliminate this problem with our children's self esteem.
</P>
<P><U><EM>Alter our Attitudes - Make Love Fashionable</EM></U>
</P>
<P>The first step in resolving this crisis starts with us - the adults and the parents.  We need to first examine our own attitudes and the norms that form the basis of our social interactions.  Let us appoint love as the avant-garde of our social intercourse.  Let us inculcate tolerance and respect for all life in our own lives and interactions.  And let this love and respect show in all our personal interactions.  There is nothing unmanly about giving love, respecting others, and solving problems amicably.  We, the adult role models for our kids, have to lead by example.  
</P>
<P>Acquisition of the material and constant indulgence in all its manifestations is symptomatic with success in our contemporaneous culture.  This is the goal that we have set for ourselves and this is what our children have to strive for.  Instant gratification, material aggrandizement and physical enhancements have become the cornerstones of success that we have established for our children.  There is no room under the current system to assign any modicum of success to a soft, mild-mannered, artistically inclined, and introvert child who is bereft of physical attributes, who is not athletically endowed and who is mediocre in academics.  These kids are perceived as social failures and are derided by their peers who are fortuitously ensconced within our defined domain of success.  We need to re-examine our definition of success not only for the sake of our children but also for ourselves.  We need to re-discover the beauty of our soul and the power of our inner creativity.  These should be glamorized as laudable pursuits of social success.  Religion and spirituality can play a pivotal role in the attainment of these ideals, as long as it is not tainted by the color of fanaticism.  
</P>
<P><U><EM>End Deification of Aggression</EM></U>
</P>
<P>Our kids are being brought up on a staple of belligerence.  Our contemporary culture can be best defined as this alarming admixture of violence and aggression.  Everything that is close to a child's heart - from sports to movies, from video games to toys, from parents to political leaders, is dyed with its color.  For impressionable young minds, that cannot discern right from wrong, this sends a very dangerous message.  The problem, however, lies more with the adults than it does with the kids.  For it is the purported discerning adults in our culture that are constantly lionizing belligerence in all our forums.  When we advocate solving social problems by physical aggression.  When we tell our kids to beat up on other kids.  When we use physical force to solve our disputes, socially, or within the family.  When we encourage and personally indulge in watching the bloody World Wresting Federation bouts.  When we love to watch movies that are replete with violence. When we extol hunting as the manifestation of manhood. When we seek military solutions to resolve political impasse.  When our own personalities exude anger and aggression.  When we advocate and personally seek physical dominance to solve all our problems.  
</P>
<P>The use of physical mite as opposed to amicable peaceful resolution sends a strong message to our youngsters - that violence is the most effective recourse to solve complex problems.  We will have to radically alter our stance on this issue.  Our establishment and espouse and practice humility, peace and harmony as the cornerstone of all our interactions.  It is imperative to reconstruct our social perception of guns.  Guns should be unequivocally advertised as instruments of violence and bearer of irreversible pain.   With the current glamour associated with guns, it is no surprise that our frustrated youth seek succor in its power to seek revenge and uphold justice.
</P>
<P><U><EM>Conclusion</EM></U>
</P>
<P>The recent escalation of violence in our midst has definitely been disquieting, if not frightening, for our concerned citizens.  But violence is not just an issue that is limited to our schools!  This is an issue that transcends our schools and our children and confronts our entire nation.  Reprehensible acts of gruesome violence have manifested themselves with rare gusto and with frightening regularity in recent years - either as organized acts of terrorism or as singular incidents of a madman's fury.  While the recent shootings by disgruntled individuals in Atlanta, Seattle, Hawaii, Philadelphia, and Memphis are testimony to individual acts of violence, the Oklahoma City and the World Trade Center bombings, and the sabotage of Pan Am, amongst many others, demonstrate the violent acts of organized terrorism.  
</P>
<P>Violence has become an alluring proposition for both the frustrated individual and fanatical organization that is seeking attention.  It has become the method of choice to seize what is rightfully yours, to get the recognition you deserve and to make your voice heard.  With an increasing competition for subsistence and affluence, this phenomenon of violence, if unchecked, will seek and find more aggressors and innocent victims from our midst.  We need to nip this in the bud - in our youth and in our children.  "Violence as a solution", should be forever erased from the impressionable minds of our children.  
</P>
<P>Our destiny is in the hands of our children.  We need to nurture them on a staple of peace and harmony.  Our future hinges on this peace that we strive to usher in our present.
