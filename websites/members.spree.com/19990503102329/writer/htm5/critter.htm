Kids do it for fun at birthday parties . Merchants use it as an advertising gimmick. Our own government does it in celebration. At
one time or another we may have all done it ignorant of the consequences. I am talking about the release of helium balloons into the
atmosphere.
<P align=left> How, one might ask, is that doing any harm? What goes up must eventually come down and the problem, is where.
Air currents frequently float these helium- filled potential killers out to sea where they burst and enter the water. Hungry sea
turtles, mistaking the floating balloon for a jelly fish, snap up the balloon, string and all. The string becomes entangled in their
intestines causing a slow agonizing death.
<P align=left> Turtles are not the only marine life affected by this simple toy. A young sperm whale was
found dying from a balloon stuck in its stomach and three feet of purple ribbon wound throughout its intestines.
Balloons have been spotted as far out to sea as 200 miles, generally singly but clusters have also been sighted.
<P align=left>What is the alternative? For the merchants, hand out balloons but let the kids have the fun of blowing them up. As for the other
events, would not the release of thousands of lady bugs have a greater positive impact to our environment? Think of the beauty and
fun of releasing butterflies in celebration. Plant a tree, or visit a wood-lot . If the event involves children have them make some
pine cones stuffed with peanut butter and bird seed to take home to their back-yards.
Why not give nature a hand? The next time you feel like celebrating, think of some ways to share your happiness with the
environment, like freeing those little bugs to do what they like best ....eating up aphids.

I am  a wildlife rehabilitator having raised raccoons, possums
 and squirrels for release back into the wild.  I   founded and
 currently chair an Oil Spill Society which trains locals how to care for
 oiled birds and beaches in the event of an oil spill and teaches school
 children of the impact of oil in our environment.  I have been doing
 this for 9 years.
 I have  a monthly nature column which is published in 3 local magazines
  I also conduct Living with Wildlife lectures in local schools.
 I have been fortunate enough to have produced /scripted a number of videos for
 cablevision on oil spills and urban wildlife.  I have just completed two
videos for children on oil and the marine environment and a public service announcement for the Scleroderma Foundation.
 I am the coordinator for a tutoring group for the learning disabled and
  produced a video on that subject "Look a little Deeper".
 I am now persuing a career as a freelance writer. I am working on a non-fiction novel about raccoons and a fiction novel The
Hunter and the Rehabber.
I enjoy writing about nature with a message.
 I am 61 years old, married to a retiree {God help me} and have two adult
 children,  and  two kittens.
