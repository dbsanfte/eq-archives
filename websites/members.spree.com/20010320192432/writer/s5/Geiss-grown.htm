<P>	When you were a little tot, the first time you got close to the stove
or the hot water tap, your Mother probably said, "No,no. Hot."  And
you looked at her and then touched it. Why? Because you didn't know
what the word "hot" meant.  However, AFTER you touched it, you had a
pretty good idea.  Chances are you didn't touch anything hot for at
least a week or so.  But, maybe a month later, you might have done it
again if you had forgotten. Usually that's all it takes.  Then you
grew up.</P>
<P>
Or did you? How are you spending your time marketing your product(s)
on the Internet? Do you ever find yourself doing the same thing the
same way, and getting the same results? If the results are good, then
you are doing something right. But if the results are small or
negligible, why are you continuing to use the same methods? Is it
because you don't know any other way?  Or is it because you're a
creature of habit?</P>

<P>If you're a creature of habit, you need to change your ways. The
Internet is changing daily.  In order to be competitive, businesses
must be aware of the changes and have the capacity to change with
them. If you don't, you will surely be left behind.  This holds true
even if what you are doing is working now. You need to keep up with
your statistics.  If your orders go down, you need to "tweak" your
system until you find what works. What works today may not work at
all tomorrow.</P>

<P>If you're not a creature of habit but just don't know what else to
do, you need to find help.  There are all sorts of free ebooks,
informative sites and other successful business owners out there that
will be happy to advise you. For the most part, business owners
remember what it's like to have "been there". Everyone started out at
one time with nothing.  Everyone also started out with no computer
knowledge or Internet knowledge.  I will readily admit that if it
hadn't been for some good souls on the Internet giving me advice, I
would probably be doing something else right now.  I believe we must
give what we have received. It's in sharing with each other that we
all become richer - not just in money but in knowledge.  And
knowledge is power.</P>

<P>So, the next time you get ready to promote your product or business,
think about your results the last time and see if you might need a
little "tweak". Don't keep burning yourself on that stove!</P>
