<pre>
My father spoke coarse words to those whose lives dimmed
As father spoke to them.  He read to them in Bessemer light
From pamphlets; next to the rollpress, The Masses; at lunch,
The New Masses; after work, the Daily; and sometimes read
Them letters sent from home. They could not read paycheck
Stubs; they could not decipher danger signs around the work
So they listened closely only to workplace sounds, ignored
My father's chant of crimes against the commonest among
Them; the wretched scream of metal upon metal they heard,
Their wounded suppressed the screams of pain for paycheck;
Among furnaces, they licked their wounds and in steel beams 
The fine print of their contract souls encased.  O, Read to me.

I studied father's words from upside down; at his knee as he
spoke I learned the rhythm of his doctrine, the bible of escape.
Afterward it was this thirst that remained. Read to me.
Creviced and mortared into place, familiar elbows at the bar;
Their seats lodged in old concrete and brick; in their lungs
And on their lips only the iron-dust and only the smokestack
Until they are called in their tongue by the foreman to work:
"Someone must serve, Nem? Through service we should rise;
As it is written, 'by the sweat of the brow.' You should read."

Pitiless steel red as paprikas hot as summer
Even at evening's Venus risen and at moonset
The long slab must be burnished to perfection,
The soul's imperfections burned with distinction.
Like the moth we are drawn to its firelight
And like the moth we die to near to heat.
No.  We shall not die.  We shall live for ever
And ever--na veky veku--in cold steel; live;
So we say to one and the other--I will be sky-
Scraper!  I shall be cannon!  Rifle and rapier!
I become prison bars, badge on a warden coat.

Ferenc Ferenchaza hammers the I-beam,
Seeks flaws, simple cracks in the skills
Of his fellow workers; Sometimes he faults
Only the steel for its splintering: Is not man,
Says Ferenc Ferenchaza, is the nature of ore
And the nature of work to be imperfect.
Man drunk and man whoring is perfect.
"What say your pamphlets to my heresies?"
The long steel that must be perfect runs daylong
From furnace to press, from ugly ore to galvanize.
Its flowers shine pretty; it grows corrugated thin
Like the paycheck paper sent home to old women
Who savor the scents of intrusion and extrusion.
 
Daughters dream of hard boys in fields 
Among green plants growing tall and sweet.
The furnace for such boys is their ambition.
The furnace for the workers, it is tradition.
Perfect steel is the future. Ferenc Ferenchaza pisses
On the I-beam before its final tempering. He watches
The long hardness enter furnace flames where urine 
Steams and ignites.  He says to no one, this my soul.
Goddamn who reads to make life seem some challenge
To be overcome; life is no more than this urine and its
Steam--it comes out between the legs, ignites
The hopeless, in untrained stream it dissipates.
Strongmen never die but live for ever and ever--
Na veky veku--in cold steel they will live forever;
So we say to one and other, I will be skyscraper!
I shall be cannon!  I, rifle!  I, sword!  And I, the chain.
And I become prison bars, prison bed, and foreman?
He--Ferenc Ferenchaza--is the prison gate.
