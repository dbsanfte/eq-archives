<P>Young Isaac Newton escaped the Cambridge plague of 1666 by returning to his stone cottage in
Woolsthorpe. At night, quite alone, he looked through the leaded glass windows at his bedside into
the cool light of the great heavens which slowly shifted position above him like a giant clockwork
pulverizing time on the grindstone of shifting space.</P> 
The unknown always seems chaotic and menacing <BR>
until superstitions give way to suspicions.<BR>
Inevitable rightness can't be defined or refined at the time.<BR>
It just feels right in the light of celestial might.<BR>

<P>At 23, Newton's young eyes were sharp. He devised a system to record the placement of each planet
within the diamond shaped quadrants of his bedroom window panes. As he kept his records month
after month and read the mathematics of Tyco Brach, he found in the night skies patterns that
tranformed a cold and ruthless canopy into a predictable embracing universe. </P>
<BR>The unknown always seems chaotic and menacing 
<BR>until superstitions give way to suspicions.
<BR>Inevitable rightness can't be defined or refined at the time.
<BR> It just feels right in the light of celestial might.
<BR>
<P>Newton observed the planets moving not in circles but in ellipses. Objects accelerate as they
approach the sun and are retarded as they move away throwing the pathway out of round. Newton
discovered that he could calculate speeds that depend upon a hundred variables even when their
influences are never the same from one instant to the next, so discovering calculus. </P><BR>
The unknown always seems chaotic and menacing 
until superstitions give way to suspicions.<BR>
Inevitable rightness can't be defined or refined at the time.<BR>
 It just feels right in the light of celestial might.<BR>

<P>His neighbors thought him quite mad. Why should young Newton try to write down the sky in
numbers? Doesn't science have finer tools than leaded glass templates? How can such a fabric of
speculation be true? Newton looked up into his sky with renewed admiration. All was suddenly
right. His neighbors were angry. Newton broke open their sky, revealing an emptiness which
frightened them.</P>

<P>His form emerged from their chaos, while their chaos emerged from his form.
</P>

<P>John Milton was crushed after his Glorious Revolution failed. The people restored a decadent and
corrupt King to the throne of England. But why? Milton was frightened for his life. His outspoken
support for uprightness and justice now made him a traitor for openly doubting royal authority. He
feared the people who had rejected even the idea of a just society.</P>
<BR>
                 The unknown always seems chaotic and menacing <BR>

                    until superstitions give way to suspicions.<BR>

                   It just feels right in the light of celestial might.<BR>

<P>In 1666, John Milton hid away in a tiny London flat. He was losing his eyesight and was forced to
retreat within himself to seek explanations. As visions came, he began to recite poetry to his
daughters who wrote down what he said, even though they only half understood what his words
might mean. He wrote Paradise Lost to try to explain man's terrible weakness for wickedness and sin.
</P><BR>

                    until superstitions give way to suspicions.<BR>

               Inevitable rightness can't be defined or refined at the time.<BR>

                   It just feels right in the light of celestial might.<BR>

<P>He wanted to understand the failure of goodness. Why would people push away honest
government and embrace the old world of self-deception? self-destruction? greed? Why does man
stray from his true self like a planet wobbling off its course? How can frail man relocate the capacity
for goodness like a comet finding his true pathway in a burning, ice-blue calculus of honest
emotion?</P>
<BR>
                 The unknown always seems chaotic and menacing 
<BR>
                    until superstitions give way to suspicions.

               Inevitable rightness can't be defined or refined at the time.
<BR>
                   It just feels right in the light of celestial might.
<BR>
<P>The madness of Milton's failed revolution began to make sense to him as he thought of these things
and saw beyond ungovernable Royalist frenzies. His neighbors thought him quite mad. Why does
blind Milton try to see into the human soul while science has the tools to open up the whole sky?
Milton rejoiced and spoke secretly with his publisher while Newton made plans to return to
Cambridge </P>

<P>-- like two comets streaking across the sky of inevitable rightness.</P>
