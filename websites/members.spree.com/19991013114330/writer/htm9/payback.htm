At the canteen in El-Arish </FONT><BR><P><FONT size="+1">
 In the summer of 1968, I went south with my battalion to take part
 in a big army exercise in the Sinai Desert. On our arrival that
 afternoon, I entered the huge canteen that sprouted like an oasis
at the El-Arish junction. The mob of soldiers in the hall created a
deafening din. Hungry men crowded around small tables
overburdened with heaps of food and queues of diners. While I
mulled whether to join the long, jostling line or settle for the lunch
box my wife had slipped into my pack, I heard voices calling my
 name. I searched through the crush in the giant hall, wondering
 which of my long-lost friends had chosen this place, this time, to
 renew severed ties. My eye alighted on a knot of soldiers smiling
 at me from their seats at one of the tables. A hand waved hello
 and invited me to join them. Steering a careful course through the
 tray-laden men dashing around me, I went towards the group. 
<BR><P>
"So, how are you? How long has it been since we last saw each
                              other? Ten years? Can it be more?" I shook hands and nodded
                              my head in greeting to men I didn't recognize. Only Yeshayahu
                              Barak I knew at once. Shaya hadn't changed a bit. The same
                              cigarette nervously clamped between the fingers of his left hand,
                              the same dark, drooping mustache that seemed never to have
                              been trimmed, the same fine eyes radiant with light. <BR><P>
"Come down with the others for the big exercise? Let's thank
                              reserve duty for bringing people back together and reviving the
                              past." Shaya shifted his chair, pushed another forward and said,
                              "Come on, take a seat, it'll be years before we meet again. Don't
                              be in such a hurry to get away from me this time." <BR><P>
One of his comrades rose from his chair. "Shaya, for you I'll even
                              give up my seat." "Thanks a lot," Shaya shot back. "You slept on
                              my shoulder the whole stinking ride from Tel Aviv." I took the
                              vacant seat. The bedlam in the huge canteen was forgotten, as
                              though I were sitting with Shaya Barak in the open Sinai under a
                              shady tamarisk tree surrounded by the desert's perfect, silent
                              tranquility. <BR><P>
We had been dear friends ten years earlier. Military service
                              threw us together entirely by chance, but we instantly became
                              inseparable. Yeshayahu Barak took a close interest in those
                              matters that I shielded from others, including him, while I was
                              interested in precisely those things that he didn't trouble to hide.
                              Friendships like these bloom and wither during your years in the
                              army, and you can never guess if they'll stand the test of time, but
                              ours grew stronger through the ups and downs of our military
                              service. We even felt the need to exchange short notes in the first
                              months after our discharge, when each of us was busy finding his
                              way for the first time in the new world of civilian life. Eventually,
                              however, even we grew apart. Now and then, we still dropped
                              each other a line like this: "You schmuck, I came looking for you
                              today, but you weren't in. When can we meet???" Later, even
                              that stopped. The closeness between us slowly became a
                              memory. I missed his coughing and hacking on cold mornings, I
                              pined for his long-range spitting and the Arab curses he growled
                              when truly enraged before seeking silent solace in the smoke of
                              a cigarette. He was an expert at brewing aromatic coffee, which
                              he always served with an instructive story drawn from life before
                              induction and told in his hoarse morning voice. Looking back, I
                              realized that the days we spent in our army tents were numbered
                              from the start and only our youthful naivete had misled us into the
                              expectation that they would last forever. 
<BR><P>"So," Shaya needled me, "tell the truth now, how many books
                              have you written?" His question flustered me. Who had given him
                              permission to speak in public of my secret desire to write? If I
                              had yet to write a single line, if no book or newspaper had
                              printed so much as a word of mine, I had whiled away many an
                              idle hour dreaming of being an author. I was in such a daze that
                              my answer was uncharacteristically feeble, lacking my usual wit
                              and humor, as if I had been caught in a blatant lie. "What, you still
                              haven't written a book?" Shaya persisted, apparently unaware of
                              the confu-sion gripping me. "That's strange. I was sure you would
                              have at least 10 books to your name by now." 
<BR><P>Suddenly, I felt ill and sweat poured over my body. I feared that
                              my face was turning a shade of red. I'm in the hot, stifling army
                              canteen in El-Arish one afternoon, the air thick with the
                              coarseness of hundreds of milling soldiers, when an old friend
                              suddenly pops up and asks me, straight out, a question so
                              painful I'd never had the courage to put it to myself. It might as
                              well have been a terrible, swift sword slicing my flesh. I had the
                              feeling that he was right; it hurt, but he was right. It wasn't just that
                              I ought to have written 10 books but that I should have become a
                              well-known author, if not to the hundreds of soldiers on their way
                              south for the large exercise in the Sinai, then at least to my
                              comrade Yeshayahu Barak. He was an old friend, we went way
                              back. Was that why he dared foretell what I would write? Didn't
                              he sense the chutzpa in this challenge to my future fortunes? 
<BR><P>"No," I answered in a faint voice. "No, I still haven't managed to
                              write even one book." I was so ashamed the instant I replied, and
                              felt so guilty in his sight, that I nearly sprang from my seat onto
                              the table to shout, "Here I am, I'm guilty. The 10 books I haven't
                              written stand against me as so many indictments. I can't deny
                              them. Charge me with them, accuse me of everything if you wish,
                              of indolence and sloth, of addiction to life and neglect of my duty
                              to compose. But for God's sake, do it quietly. Keep your voices
                              down and don't make a scene of my condemnation. You can see
                              for yourselves how hard it is on me to stand in the dock."
