<P>You are my sunshine may not just be a music title but the number one 
clue to a healthier you!</P>

<P>We all know too much sun is not good for you but do you really
know what sun does for you? Yes, there are great benefits to
be had from the sun!</P>

<P>Here are some comments from Dr. Guy Schenker, concerning sunlight. 
Receiving adequate sunlight is as important as taking any nutritional
supplementation. Dr. Schenker addresses such conditions as depression, 
osteoporosis, chronic fatigue and ADD.</P>

<P>Dr. Schenker says, "It can be said, as long as you do not obtain 
the benefits of natural light in the eyes, health will never be 
regained and maintained."</P>

<P>It is almost always winter somewhere in our world and the, 
*Lack of sunlight* is creating problems for some of you and 
you aren't even aware of it!</P>
<P>
Summer has longer days and therefore a chance to get more sunlight 
at the end of a work day but with winter and shorter days it's very 
difficult to get into the sunlight!</P>

<P>The doctor's offices, here in the United States, tend to start getting 
more crowded in October or November with colds, flu and other 
ailments that come about from lack of proper nutrition and if the 
truth be know caused from lack of sufficient sunlight on top of 
lack of vitamins and minerals.</P> 

<P>Do you suffer from depression or anxiety? Chances are,
inadequate light intake is a part of the problem.</P>

<P>Do you have osteoporosis? Undoubtedly you need more
sunlight on your skin for vitamin D, but even more
importantly in your eyes to regulate the hormonal and biochemical
systems it controls -- related to mineral metabolism in general and
osteoblastic activity in particular.</P> 

<P>Do you suffer from chronic fatigue? Adequate sunlight can be an 
important part of increasing your vitality. </P>

<P>Do you know of any children (or adults) with attention deficit disorder? 
This condition is strongly correlated with unnatural light entering 
the eyes as well.</P>

<P>You see, when the light hits the optic nerve, it is carried to other parts
of the brain in addition to the vision center. Particularly it is carried
to the hypothalamus where it is an essential nutrient to regulate
hormone balance and autonomic nerve balance.</P>

<P>It has been shown beyond all doubt that the depression and lethargy
associated with seasonal affective disorder is nothing more than
inadequate natural light and/or excess un-natural light. </P>

<P>I think it is reasonable to conclude that virtually all cases of 
depression and lethargy include some element of a "seasonal 
affective disorder." Think of the millions of poor souls that are 
dependent upon Prozac and other feel-good drugs just to make 
life tolerable. How many of these people spend at least 22 out 
of 24 hours either in darkness or in un-natural indoor lighting 
(not to mention the hours spent in front of the TV or computer 
monitor)? </P>

<P>In the late 1800s' early 1900s' sunlight treatment was one of 
the prominent treatments used to build up health. The hospitals 
were called sanitariums in those days. They found out by getting 
patients outside into sunlight daily their health started to improve. 
Some of the sanitariums put in gardens to get the patients 
outside and prescriptions then were working in the garden. 
The health of the majority did improve greatly.</P> 

<P>When chemical medications came into being that treatment 
started to wane and has just left our planet of thinking. 
I believe if doctors ordered their patients to get out and 
get more sunlight they would find a healthier patient!</P>

<P>Take into consideration the cigarettes, coffee, sugars and 
lack of sunlight taken in by a lot of you and you have a very 
sick person waiting to happen!</P>

<P>Sun could be the key to your health! Get away from your 
computer and get outside for a while each day!</P>

<P>Put healthy sunshine into your life! Get out for some sun!</P>
