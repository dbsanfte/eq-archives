				<P>
				"I created my wife." It's the comment my husband Bob uses to explain how we
met. He gets a laugh but he does not mean to be funny. He really believes he
created me . . . and our ideal eighteen-year romantic marriage.</P>

<P>How did he do it? When I tell you, you'll know how to create the perfect
partner for yourself. In fact, you'll know how to start making every one of
your dreams come true.</P>

<P>It was the year 1982. My husband had just lost his first wife in a car
accident. He had been married to her for nineteen years but it had not been
a happy marriage. She had had two affairs, had left him twice, and had
returned each time promising things she couldn't deliver. One of her
promises was honesty. Bob was willing to forgive her for the affairs, but he
believed with all his heart that he needed to hear the whole story in order
to do so. She believed it was best to put the past in the past, and she
wanted Bob to stop bringing it up. Consequently, when she died, Bob was left
with a well of anger, hurt and grief . . . that he didn't want to repeat in
another relationship.</P>

<P>"How can I find someone who will be totally honest with me?" Bob had no
idea. As a salesman, though, he had used written lists to achieve his goals
. . . and he wondered if the same thing would work with a relationship. "Can
I simply write down what I want and get it?" he asked.</P>

<P>"Honest. She has to be honest." He took out a yellow legal pad and that's
the first thing he wrote on it. He added: Warm, caring, willing to share,
insightful, intelligent, a quick thinker. She has to be worldly in the form
of experience, but not so worldly that she needs other men. She has to be
willing to know that her past experiences have made her the woman she is,
and not try to repeat them. She has to be willing to settle down in a
one-person relationship, be very committed to me, good with children, and
she has to enjoy being a woman. (He didn't want much, did he?)</P>
<P>
On our first dinner date, Bob asked me a question that made me want to get
away from him as quickly as possible. He me how many men I had been with.
I'll sketch the scene for you. Before me sat a very handsome, very available
man that every woman in our town desired. He was financially secure, loved
children, and had a reputation as a devoted partner. He was articulate, warm
and funny. Why on earth did he want to know how many men I had been with?
Was he a closet pervert?</P>

<P>I wanted to bolt, but something in his eyes kept me from doing it. There was
a hint of pain and sadness that made me think his question had a perfectly
legitimate foundation. I asked, "Why do you want to know?" and his story of
betrayal, hurt and unrequited desire poured out.</P>

<P>With tears in my eyes I answered his question and when I finished, I
blushed. I didn't have a lot of men to tell him about, but I had long
stories to tell that explained each relationship. "I hope I haven't talked
too much," I said. I had been criticized so many times for talking too much,
for knowing too much, for being too insightful, for being too analytical.
</P>
<P>"Oh, no!" Bob cried. "I want a woman who's willing to talk about herself"
and he was telling the truth. After eighteen years of marriage, he still
wants to know what I think and feel. Yesterday, for example, he played golf
for the first time in a month. When he returned, he took me to the park. "I
know you'll have lots to talk about," he said. We had just spent four days
together watching the U.S. Open, reacting and talking, and yet he still
wanted to know more about me.</P>

<P>We spend most of our days together now, since we're both authors and work
from home, and Bob has never outgrown his original list. He still wants all
of the things he wrote on his list that day in 1982, and all I have to do to
please him is . . . be myself and talk too much.</P>

<P>What qualities would you like in a husband? A career? A home? Just grab a
yellow pad and a pen and start writing . . . and you'll create them.</P>

<P> Mary Anne Thomas's "Creative Relationships" discoveries
have been taught in popular and professional seminars all around the world,
and her "Creative Relationships" course was the first information on
relationships taught to family practice physicians through the University of
North Carolina Medical School. Mary Anne is the author of "An Adventure of
the Mind," a new spiritual workbook that teaches you how to manifest your
dreams using mental and spiritual tools rather than physical effort. It's
the true story of her own adventure with her husband following the death of
their son, as they decided to find more powerful, more spiritual ways to
live. Find "An Adventure of the Mind" as well as free articles that teach
the wonders of creating with the mind at http://www.mindadventures.com</P>
