	<b>
	<P>I just had a damn strange thought.  It has to do with fingernails, my dead mother, and 
Ernest Hemingway.   I woke early this morning because our puppy, Barnaby, was clamoring for a walk.  It was 6 AM and, try as she might to avoid it, my wife had awakened him.  He's only four months old, and is still being house trained.   When he has to go, he has to go.
</P>
<P>The walk was brief.  It was cold and raining so hard that we both wanted to take care of business and get back inside as quickly as possible.  My wife was up early to catch a taxi to the airport in time for an early morning business flight to London.  She's the breadwinner now, has been almost exclusively for the last two years. 
</P>
	<P>I changed professions some years ago.  I had a mid-life crisis and, under the influence of Leon Russell and Jimmy Buffet music lyrics, resigned from a job in international journalism.  I wanted to be 'King of Somewhere Hot".  My wife and I bought and managed an old hotel on a remote and unspoiled Florida island. It was the manifestation of one of fate's jokes, 'be careful what you wish for. You might get it.'  It was an interesting life experience, but it burned me out and damn near wrecked our marriage.  I learned a lesson that one sure way sure to put maximum stress on a relationship is to try running a business together.  After five years, I was a nervous wreck.  Our marriage was more important than the hotel.  We sold it and decided to go back to our former professions.  Unfortunately, during the years we ran the hotel, I clocked 50 and found that it is hard to make a comeback in any profession after a five-year hiatus.</P>
<P>The other thing that happened had to do with my health.  I have always kept myself in reasonably good shape.  While I've abused my body from time to time, I've carefully regulated that abuse.  I drink, but not excessively.  I did drugs during the 60's and 70's like most everybody else, and enjoyed the heck out of it.  During my single years, before the onset of AIDS brought the sexual revolution to an abrupt halt, I was as promiscuous as a rabbit.</P>	
<P>It was during those months when I was spending my days commuting into Manhattan and subjecting myself to job interviews from people 20 years my junior, that I noticed I was losing dexterity in my right hand and arm.  The United States excuse for a health-care system bounced me around from doctor to doctor. I was slid into coffin-like tubes for brain scans and MRI's, stuck with needles, peed in cups, and was shocked with electrodes. The doctors shrugged and finally confessed,  "We haven't a clue what's wrong with you!"  A year later, a physician in England who knew what the hell he was doing spent 20 minutes examining me.  He had me walk up and down a hallway while he watched, told me to sit down and take a deep breath.  He informed me that I have Parkinson's disease.</P>	
<P>I've been living with the disease now for a year and a half.  It's like being stalked by a mugger.  He may not get you today. But he's always out there somewhere, and one of these days, one of these days, the son-of-a-bitch is going to catch up with you.  Until that day, I fight the disease as best I can.  I work out three days a week. Taking into account my age, I'm in better shape now than I've been since I went through Navy boot camp 30 years ago.  It is truly ironic to me that I take drugs now because I have to.</P>	
<P>This morning as I took the first round of red, brown, green and white inhibitors, prohibitors and agonists, I noticed my fingernails had grown unduly long.  My thinning hair is longer even than it was when I was a hippie.  My appearance of late is somewhat in the style of an aging rock star gone to seed.  My wife calls it my Howard Hughes dementia look.  As I reached for the clippers, I wondered whether my accelerated fingernails are a side effect of the drugs. Do the drugs speed up the growth of cartilage or whatever fingernails are made of?</P>	
<P>I was contemplating this less than profound question when I flashed on a memory of my mother the last time I saw her.  It was just before they closed the casket.  I was reflecting on how true it is that dead people really do look dead, and trying not to show my irritation at the little old lady who was patting me on the shoulder and trying to console me.  </P>	
<P>''My my," Mom's canasta partner sighed, "she looks so nice.  It's like she's sleeping and she's going to wake right up and walk out of here!" </P>	
<P>A few minutes earlier, I'd had to gently restrain this woman when she took out an instamatic camera and started to take a photograph.  She was genuinely surprised that I did not want a photo of my dead mother to keep as a memory of the occasion. </P>	
<P>I was pleased to see that my mother's favorite ring was on her finger.  At least the bastards at the nursing home had not stolen it like most everything else before I could get there.  That's when I looked at her fingernail, the fingernail on the finger that she had injured years before and that was a bit crooked as a result.  I noticed that my fingernail on the same finger looked just like my mother's, same shape, grooves and even coloration.</P>	
<P>As I clipped that nail, I was having rather morbid thoughts about my own mortality.  I've been thinking about that more than usual lately because of Ernest Hemingway.  He's been a big influence on my writing career.  I really don't give a damn that he is not in vogue at the moment with some in the contemporary literary hoi palloi.  In his prime, he wrote some of the best and most succinct sentences I've ever read.  The Old Man And The Sea is on my list of ten books I would like to have if I'm ever cast ashore on a desert island.</P>	
<P>There have been times in my life when my interest in Hemingway has verged on obsession.  As a reporter in Florida in the 70's, I produced a series of television reports on Hemingway's Key West years.  It included an interview with a Charlie Thompson, Hemingway's fishing and hunting buddy.  It is probably the best interview I've ever done.  So, when I found myself in Utah with the weekend ahead before I had to be back in Manhattan and realized I wasn't very far from Ketchum, Idaho, I booked a flight.  Ketchum is where Ernest offed himself at the age of 61 or so.  I flew to Boise, rented a car, drove to Ketchum and took a walk along the stream that flows near his house.
I peeked in through the window at the foyer where he stuck a shotgun in his mouth and said hello to eternity, or the lack thereof.  The next morning at sunrise, I walked to the cemetery with a bottle of good Cuban rum.  I sat down beside his gravestone, took a drink and gave Ernest one as well. 
</P>	
<P>Ernest's decision to end his life has been bouncing around in my head of late because of a BBC program hosted by Michael Palin who also made the pilgrimage to the Ketchum Cemetery.  I've enjoyed pretty much everything that Palin does since my first exposure to his sense of humor in Monte Python.  Palin not only visited the grave and the Ketchum house.  He managed to finagle permission to spend the night there.  I've often pondered what drove Ernest to kill himself, what he was thinking that last night.  I think I know.</P>	
<P>As I contemplate my own life and debate with myself how to get the best out of the years I have left, I wonder, is suicide courage or cowardice.  I don't want to be a burden.  I've read enough about Parkinson's disease to know what it can eventually do to me.  I don't want to be a drooling, shaking, senile piece of withering meat stuck in a wheelchair with people I used to know and love looking down at me and lying to each other, "My, he looks good today.  I think he may have even recognized me!"

</P>	
<P>But, today I'm not there yet.  I have a puppy that needs to be house broken and a wife who I love deeply and who loves me. I like to think I've got at least a while yet before my neurons fail altogether and my mind shuts down.  So, for the time being, I'll keep on living and keep on writing. While it is certain I'll never surpass Hemingway in writing skill, I may just manage to stick around longer than he did. Who knows?  Who the hell knows?				</P>
