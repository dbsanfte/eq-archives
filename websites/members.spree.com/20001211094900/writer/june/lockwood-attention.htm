	<P>Why do some things catch your attention and others don't?</P>

<P>Remember the last time you decided to buy a car? Once you 
decided what kind of car you wanted, all of a sudden, you 
started seeing more of that kind of car on the streets. Were 
they there before and you just didn't pay attention to them? 
A pregnant woman will start noticing other pregnant women. 
Your new house is close to railroad tracks, yet after a few 
days, you don't hear the trains anymore.</P>

<P>What is it that provokes your attention? At the base of the 
brain where it connects to the spinal chord is a region known 
as the Reticular Activating System (RAS). The RAS acts as a 
newspaper editor. Editors make decisions regarding which 
stories get big headlines, page one treatment, and which 
items wind up buried with the ads on page sixteen.</P>

<P>The RAS receives thousands of messages each second. 
Everything you see, hear, smell, feel and touch is a message 
entering your brain. The Reticular Activating System filters 
through all these messages and decides which ones will get 
page one treatment - that is, arouse the brain.</P>

<P>The largest portion of the brain is the cerebrum. This is 
the center for cognition or thought. Deep within the central 
portion of the brain are the subsystems that are triggered by 
emotions. When a signal gets through the "editor" ( Reticular 
Activating System ) and arrives at the cerebrum, the brain 
turns on thoughts, emotions or both.</P>
<P>
Even though the cerebrum is the center for high level thought, 
it is unresponsive unless the reticular formation sends a 
signal to begin the data processing. Here's the hard part. 
What causes some messages to get through the filter and 
others to be blocked out?</P>

<P>One of the things we've learned from working with 
entrepreneurs is that we tend to pay attention to the things 
which are important to us at the time. If our currently 
dominant thoughts are about creating a new brochure, we'll 
start seeing other brochures. We'll hear conversations about 
brochures. We'll pick up ideas relating to brochures and 
even notice colors that would be attractive for the new 
brochure.</P>

<P>In other words, the Reticular Activating System will pass 
through anything even remotely related to the important 
issue - the brochure. From a practical point of view, this 
means that, if we want to solve a problem or achieve a goal, 
keep it at the top of your mind. Think about it, talk about 
it, write about it and imagine it completed. This is one of 
the reasons why affirmations work so well and why it is 
important to review your goals frequently.</P>

<P>Some people will keep an idea at "top of mind" by creating 
a notebook of pictures, cut from magazines, that reflect 
their idea or their desired end result. This "image book" 
helps the visualization process, keeps the brain focused on 
the important issue and triggers the RAS.</P>

<P>If it's possible to turn on the brain, is it also possible to 
turn it off?</P>
<P>
There are three common situations where the brain is more than 
likely to shut down.</P>
<P>
Conflict... One of the ways to turn off the brain involves the 
use of conceptual conflicts. Ironically, conceptual conflict 
can also turn on your brain and stimulate creative thought, 
but only if you have beensuccessful in resolving small 
amounts of conflict in similar situations. Such a back ground 
will have provided you with a reservoir of confidence you can 
tap regarding the new question.</P>

<P>However, the insecure person may look at the difference 
between the expected outcome and the real result and sigh: 
"I'm wrong again. I can't do this." If the problem appears 
unsolvable or out of reach, we may just give up before we 
ever get started.</P>

<P>Overstimulation... Have you ever decided to clean the garage, 
but after inspecting the area, decided to take a nap? Have 
you ever committed yourself to a night of preparation for a 
big presentation, but once you scanned the material and 
noticed how overwhelmingly difficult it seems, decided to do 
other tasks that were long overdue?</P>

<P>These are classic examples of flight behavior. Despite your 
good intentions of cleaning or preparing, you gave up before 
you started. The tasks were so large that you didn't know 
where to begin. Was your brain stimulated? Yes, but it was 
so over-stimulated that it shut down, and the outward behavior 
may have been physical. You find yourself very tired: "I'll 
clean the garage after I take a nap." You might even get sick: 
"I was so nervous about the presentation that I got nauseous."</P>

<P>To avoid shutting down your brain from overstimulation, break 
a large or difficult into several steps, then tackle the 
project a step at a time.</P>

<P>Understimulation... The more popular term for this condition 
is boredom. Whenever a behavior is repeated to the extent that 
it is habitual, the brain shuts down. Shouting at a child to 
"Sit down and shut up" will grab their attention and they will 
respond for a while, but if you choose to begin every day with 
that command, the child will suddenly "go deaf" and not even 
hear you.</P>

<P>Closely allied with the repetition of behavior is the 
familiarity of the subject matter. When you announce to your 
team that the next day will be devoted to smile training for 
customer service, they greet you with a moan, "smile training 
again!"</P>

<P>The familiar is usually not a great motivator. Perhaps the key 
to interest is making the familiar seem strange. For example, 
setting up role play situations where your team members get to 
act out the part of customer and service representative in a 
variety of situations. Try something new. Don't fall asleep in 
your comfort zone.</P>

<P>As we have seen, there is a thin line between the actions that 
turn the brain on and off. By taking advantage of how your 
brain works, you can increase your creativity, reduce boredom, 
boost recognition of opportunities and accelerate achievement 
of your goals.</P>

<P>Where do you start? Write down the five most important 
outcomes you want to achieve in the coming year. Put this 
paper in a convenient place where you can read it every day. 
This affirmation of your preferred future will keep your 
Reticular Activating System working for you, filtering in the 
sights, sounds, ideas and people to help you get there.</P>

<P>In other words, it will get your attention.</P>
