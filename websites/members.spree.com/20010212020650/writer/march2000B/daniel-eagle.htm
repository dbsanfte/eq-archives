<CENTER>
The morning sky was dark and foreboding as the hunter<br>
left the stillness of his lodge to seek out the<br>
Great Buffalo Herd.<br>

The cold, gnawing pangs of hunger would no longer<br>
be denied as he sought out his prey upon the<br>
lonely, wind-swept plain.<br>
And as he silently rode his horse across the prairie,<br>
he came to hear the screeching whistle of an eagle<br>
and looking above into the first slivers of light,<br>
he greeted this hunter of the morning sky.<p>

As the eagle circled overhead,<br>
he called back to the hunter...<p>

"Take heed, my brother, take heed;<br>
for that which you do today shall become<br>
the way of your life."<p>

With this message delivered, the eagle vanished before<br>
the eyes of the hunter and again his world returned<br>
to the darkness of need.<br>

Long did he search the vast emptiness for signs of the<br>
buffalo, but it was as if the Great-Spirit-Above had<br>
caused the Earth-Mother to swallow up all that lived<br>
to be hunted.<br>

But in the twilight of the day's end did the hunter<br>
spy the lone White Buffalo Calf off in the distance;<br>
and so he left his horse and by stealth afoot did he<br>
come within striking range of this rare and elusive prey.<br>

The arrow was strung, the bowstring arched against his<br>
chin in deadly aim, when the eyes of the hunted and the hunter<br>
locked in a final stare;<br>
and there, for the first time, was hesitation in the<br>
hunter's resolve as he recalled the eagle's warning.<p>

And the hunter thought within himself...<p>

'It is better that I go hungry for yet another day than to<br>
rob this Sacred Being of its life for a meal.<br>
It is better that I endure the winter cold with naked innocence<br>
than to wrap my shame within this little one's white robe of
purity.'<p>

Thus the hunter relaxed his arrow of death,<br>
laid his bow upon the ground before his feet and<br>
spoke to the White Buffalo Calf...<p>

"Forgive me little one;<br>
the hunger of my needs clouded my heart<br>
and sought your death that I might live another day.<br>
Forgive me and go your way in peace."<p>

The White Buffalo Calf did not go away but rather walked<br>
towards the hunter and in a blinding flash of light turned<br>
into a beautiful maiden dressed in white and walking not<br>
with feet that touched the earth.<br>
There was a great shining light held within her eyes<br>
and the hunter fell to his knees in deep remorse for that<br>
which he had almost done.<p>

And the Sacred Being softly spoke words of encouragement<br>
to the would-be hunter:<p>

"The Great-Spirit-Above placed the buffalo upon the plains<br>
that the People's needs might be fulfilled.<br>
There is no shame in taking the life of the four-legged<br>
that the People may live.<br>
Only the wanton slaughter of an innocent creature is evil<br>
and causes the Earth-Mother to weep in sorrow and in pain.<br>
Few have found the White Buffalo Calf,<br>
for it can only be seen with eyes that seek in a sacred manner.<br>
From this day forth you are to be a Holy Man,<br>
hunting not for meat to feed the emptiness of your belly<br>
but hunting within for the wisdom that will fill the ever<br>
expanding heart.<br>
Visions and dreams shall become your hunting ground,<br>
for the People's needs will change with the passing of<br>
the Great Buffalo Herd.<br>
Yearnings yet unknown shall fall heavy upon their shoulders;<br>
confusion and untold sorrow await those who endlessly search<br>
the mist for the ways of old.<br>
You must find the Light and show them the way."<p>

When the Sacred Maiden had finished speaking<br>
these holy words to the hunter,<br>
she changed into a white-winged eagle<br>
and though the earth lay in darkness,<br>
she was bathed in a flood of Light.<p>

And before she flew away from whence she came,<br>
she called out to the hunter one final time...<p>

"Hunka Brother,<br>
I give to you this day a new name;<br>
from now until all time has ceased,<br>
you shall be known as...<p>

...Eagle from the Light."<p>
