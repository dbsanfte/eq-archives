HOW TO INTERVIEW<BR><BR>

        <FONT color="#ab0a50">One of the most common feelings towards interviewing is fear. It is a shared
emotion affecting both the interviewer and the person being interviewed. A good way to
approach this fear is to make your first few interviews with folks that you already know,
and topics that you are comfortable with. After you have completed a few, you’ll see that
most often they can be fun and relaxed conversations, and that there is no need to fear
them. As your interviewing skills grow with practice, so will your confidence level.<BR><BR>
        <FONT color="#eead0e">A  fact that is often overlooked in interviewing is that you, as the person
conducting the interview should lead the way. It’s your responsibility to listen and to
keep the talk flowing. It is best to have your questions prepared in advance, and practice
them out loud a few times before the interview begins. In this way you will feel more
confident and in control.<BR><BR>
       <FONT color="#191919">The interview must remain interesting, for yourself, your subject, and ultimately
for your reader. To achieve this  - try to build a rapport with the subject, this will make
you feel much more at ease, as well as ease the tensions of your subject, if you are relaxed
and confident the interview will proceed with fewer hitches, and be smoother - this in
turn will ease the subject. You shouldn’t however, go overboard and abandon all
convention, formality has its place in interviews. While familiarity is your ultimate goal -
the best way to reach  this goal is by showing respect to the person you are interviewing.<BR><BR>
        <FONT color="#cdad00">Try not to monopolize the conversation, especially in the beginning, remember
you are just the reporter, the person you are chatting with is the one you want your
reader to care about. Encourage the subject to talk as much as possible, while
remembering they are, more than likely, just as nervous as you are. Don’t be rigid and
unbending in the direction the interview takes, allow the subject to lead, listen, and then
follow - up with your original line of questioning. If they give answers that are too general
for your liking, or that will provide boring copy - allow them to finish their response, then
follow-up gently with a more probing question. One technique that sometimes helps here
is to recall an amusing or entertaining story you’ve heard regarding the person you’re
interviewing. This shows them that you do know who they are, that you have a genuine
interest in them, and makes them feel more confident in you and your ability. With this
gained confidence comes trust, and with trust,  more revealing answers can be given.<BR><BR>
       <FONT color="#008b45">If your interview contains topics that might be touchy, or that your subject shows
great reluctance to discuss, it can make the interview extremely difficult to conduct,
this is hard for even the most experienced interviewers. You must bring sensitivity and
patience to the interview with you and then display these at all times. There are several
ways to handle touchy subject matters. In a playful and almost friendly way you say, "
Okay, let me be the Devil’s advocate here.... did you really sleep with your best friends
dog? "  or try blaming the question on some innocuous third party,  " You know what
others are saying... that you slept with your best friends dog..." <BR><BR>
        <FONT color="#8b4726">In these touchy situations - an old 12 step approach can come in handy. In 12
step programs they tell you to "act as if". What this means is if you’re scared "act as if"
 you’re confident,-  if you’re unhappy "act as if " you’re joyous. In the case of an
interview - especially one with touchy questions it helps to "act as if"  you know more
than you do. If the subject thinks you know something already that he is reluctant to share
- this act can convince him that he won’t be spilling the beans, and he may open right up
- providing you the information you were seeking.<BR><BR>
        <FONT color="#0000ee">When all else fails... ask a straightforward question, and then follow that up by
reminding the subject that to readers silence can imply guilt, or at least result in
speculation of innocence.<BR><BR>
       <FONT color="#000000">Using these tips may help you gain confidence in approaching interviews. The
best advice is to remember that we are all human, and we all have the same fears, same
dreams and goals. Remembering this can serve to ease you into the interview, while
providing you with enough compassion and understanding to allow you to ease the
interviewee into it as well.<BR><BR>
