<P align=justify>
It's a cool day on the island and heavy clouds hang over my hillside home like
an old wool blanket… gray-blue in color… hanging barely above the nearby mountain peaks of the rain forest.      The
green hillsides have become a single drab shade, and there are dark rain showers wandering across the colorless sea far
below like homeless men on a deserted street.   It's one of those melancholy days… a day that depresses me without
reason and I find myself thinking of things, places and people long past in my life, and in some cases, people long passed
on. 
<P align=justify> 
I am alone in my home this day and I stand like a statue on my balcony… studying the scene below, contemplating events
of my life.     How can I possibly complain or feel cheated.   My life has been full and rewarding.    Still, I have some
regrets as due we all.   I was born in California on the eve of a world war, and found myself in the arms of my very young
mother, cringing beneath a tiny kitchen table during the attack on Pearl Harbor, as bombs from warplanes fell from the
sky.    We, of course, survived.    My mother and I were evacuated back to the West Coast with its miles and miles of
beaches and surf.      I grew up to be a blond and blue eyed teenager living in the best of times.   We had girls, cars,
hamburger joints and West Coast jazz.    There were the hot and sexy sounds of rhythm and blues that metamorphosed
into rock and roll.<BR> 
I grew up healthy and became a military man.    I bummed around the world on my own sailboat and did stuff most people
only imagine or dream about.   And now I stand, warm and dry and safe. 
<P align=justify>
I am on nostalgia trip this gloomy day.   My mind drifts back to my parents.   I wonder what life was <I>really</I> like for
them.   I was raised by these two people... my mom and dad... we lived in the same house... but to know what their life
was like... it's a guessing game.    My grandparents are truly the mystery.     I know so little about them.    In just one
generation, they have become faded ghosts of the past, without form, names in my memory.      My own children having
never met them… they never existed. <BR> 
I never knew my grandfather on my mother's side of the family.    But I did know my grandmother… Annie, and this is the
kind of day the spirit of my grandmother comes to visit me.    I don't mean an apparition or ghost, but she does come to
occupy my thoughts for a while.    It does not require much effort to think back and conjure up a mental picture of her.
<P align=justify> 

Far off on the low horizon, a muted flash of lighting is absorbed in dense clouds...  thunderstorms are coming I realize, but
still a long way off.<P align=justify> 

Annie Sophia Hensch was born in Denmark in the year 1880.    I know this only from an obscure scrap of paper I found in
my mother's belongings when she died.   There is nothing else I know about her life in the old country.   I find it strange that
my mother never told me anything about her own mother's earliest years... maybe I never asked. I know it doesn't make
any sense, but I seem to feel an emptiness, like there is a hole in my psyche that can never be filled.      I suppose if I had
never known Annie, it may not have caused me any grief.     But, I did know her, and as a young boy I was not aware of
the importance of knowing more about <I>her</I> life.     Now, I have this nagging regret for not taking advantage of the
opportunity to really look at who Annie was, her dreams of youth, her first meeting with the young man who would become
her husband and the father of her thirteen children. 
<P align=justify> 
This much I do know.   When Annie was about twelve, early Mormon Missionaries were in Denmark preaching and
converting the people to the ways of their religion.     Annie, along with other youths, was offered a new life in America and
eventually in the Far West… and Utah. 
<BR> 
The missionaries arranged for Annie to travel to New York, where she took up residence with a church family for several
years.   It was during this time that Annie taught herself to write and read English… no small task for a young girl who was
also somewhat indentured as a house servant. 
<P align=justify> 
The first few years passed and Annie found herself on a rail train to St. Louis, where she took up her duties and chores on
a wagon train with a destination of Salt Lake City. 
It was on that adventure that she met Albert Whitehall… a young strapping lad.   It must have been love at first sight.  
They were married in the new Mormon Church Tabernacle shortly after their arrival.   Then without family or friends, other
than the church, they took up residence in Eureka and Albert became a lifelong coal miner. 
<P align=justify> 
Annie bore her thirteen children prior to her forty-fifth birthday...  three boys and ten girls.    My mother was the last to be
born.     That's about all I know of Annie's early life. Grandfather Whitehall died of the Black Lung, the miner's disease,
when my mother was about nine years old.   The story was... he was taking some sun in an old rocker chair in the yard,
with his daughter on his lap. He suffered a fit of coughing and just passed away.     Well, he was a good family man, a
loving husband, and had worked hard and died before reaching sixty years.    The only other fact I know was that he had
been born in England, possibly Wales.     It was during the late 1930's that Grandfather Whitehall had died....    It was then
that Annie picked up what remained of her family, and with the help of the eldest children, moved to southern California
and a new life. 
<P align=justify> 
After Pearl Harbor, when my mother and I returned to California, my grandmother came to live with us while we waited
out World War Two.       My mother and her sister worked for McDonald Douglas Aircraft Company building B-29
bombers… they were riveters… a team. 
<P align=justify> 
Annie raised me like her own and we were very close… that I remember clearly.   She taught me my alphabet, counting
and my time's tables before I was five.   At the war's end and with the return of my father, Annie moved to a tiny apartment
behind the home of a well-to-do couple.      Later when I attended a nearby school, I would sometimes walk to her
apartment for lunch.    Annie would prepare a meager meal, lavishly and with love.    She had become very old by then,
and I was somehow feeling uncomfortable around her.    Of course I was only a young boy of about twelve and Annie was
slow and terribly wrinkled, and there was an odd smell in the apartment that I disliked… a sweet, musty, cloying smell.   It
was difficult for me to talk with the old woman... there seemed so little to say.    I continued to visit now and then, but I had
my own life to think about.  A few years later when I reached seventeen, I left for the military… and I never saw Annie
again. 
<P align=justify>
I was on an overseas duty somewhere, when I was told of her death.    She had died a week after Timmy, her
fourteen-year-old Siamese cat died.    She had lost her best friend, and must have seen no reason to continue living.   
Annie was eighty-six, a stooped, silver- haired ancient woman… who had loved me, her husband and her children.<BR> 
I was caught up in my own life by then, a career in the navy, a marriage and children.   Then there had been a divorce and
a life on the bum for many years to come.   I guess it was with the passing of time and maybe finally attaining some maturity
that I began to realize what was missing in my life.  I never completely appreciated how much her love meant to me. 

<BR><BR><CENTER><HR></CENTER><BR> 
<P align=justify>
A crack of lightning closer now on the horizon invaded my line of sight and my memories.   Christ, I thought... what a
sentimental fool you are.   I sighed and took a deep breath… it was time for a nice glass of wine. 
They are all gone now.    My grandparents, my parents and my siblings....     If I had only known.
