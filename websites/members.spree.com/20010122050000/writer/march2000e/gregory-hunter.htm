She walked slowly on the deserted night sidewalk and seemed not to notice
the shadow who followed.  He kept to the doorways and alleys, darting from
one to another, watching her closely.  He liked the way her skirt sashayed,
the way her hair hung straight down her back.  In the half-light of the city
at night, her hair looked dark, though he knew she was blonde.
<P align=justify>
When she stepped into the 24-hour diner, he slipped into the closest
doorway.  He waited, taking short shallow breaths, until she sat in a booth
in front of the window.  He could see her clearly, framed by the window, his
own work of art.  He loved the way her bracelets skimmed her arm, jingling
softly as she reached for her water.  She waited for her order, drumming the
table top with her long, red, nails.
<P align=justify>
They matched the color of her lips.  The color reminded him of blood, her
blood.  He shivered, his eyes closed, feeling the soft yielding flesh under
the thin, razor-sharp knife.  He felt his own blood drum in his ears.
<P align=justify>
He opened his eyes and fought to remember where he was, when he was.
<P align=justify>
He moved closer and reached the steps to the diner door.  He savored the
moment, the empty diner, the way she waited for him.  As the door opened,
she looked up and fixed her eyes to his face.  Automatically, his fingers
traced the scar on his left cheek.  He smiled, baring his teeth.  Slowly, he
walked to stand near her.
<P align=justify>
"Hello."  His voice came out a dry whisper.  He reached down, she flinched,
and he brought her water glass to his lips.  Carefully, he matched his lips
to the lipstick already on the glass.
<P align=justify>
"I've come to thank you for this," he said, finally, tracing the scar once
again.  Oh, how he ached to stroke her hair, tilting her head back to see
the tender lines of her neck.  Her doe-like eyes were browner than he
remembered, but the expression, frozen in the light, was the same.
<P align=justify>
"Let's go," he invited, gripping her upper arm.
<P align=justify>
She jumped, and he felt the arm quiver.  He could picture the inch-long scar
standing out from her skin under the thin top.  He remembered the feel of
her under him, squirming, trying so hard to avoid the knife.  Then he
remembered the shock of the fist in his stomach and the long fingernails in
his eyes, and the feel of fire across his cheek as she slashed at his face.
<P align=justify>
"Let's go," he fairly roared this time.
<P align=justify>
She gripped her large woven bag as he yanked her out of the booth.  He
pulled her out of the diner by the neck, into the darkness, pushing her into
the alley behind the diner.  His eyes darted, scanning the walls, the
windows, doorways for others who might intrude.
<P align=justify>
He reached for his knife as he turned to attack.  She held the gun steady,
lowering her aim to his chest.  He lunged but fell back as bullets slammed
into him.
<P align=justify>
From a distance, he heard the jangle of the bracelets as she stepped over
him.
