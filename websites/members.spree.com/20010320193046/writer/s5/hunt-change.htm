	<FONT FACE="Franklin Gothic Book" COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1">
	<P>So many people think they haven't got what it takes to operate a home based
business… I was one of those people but my drive to be my own boss, set my
own hours and not have to worry about my children all day long was enough to
set me on my path to financial security. The other great advantages of
course is more time with my family and the best thing of all, personal
satisfaction and achievement.</P>

<P>It would be foolish of me to tell you that it was a piece of cake because it
wasn't and still isn't. It takes a lot of hard work, determination,
patience, revisiting and revising your goals, and the guts to hang in there.
The courage to ignore people when they tell you you're crazy and it's not
going to work can be difficult, but they don't have to pay you're bills
right!</P>

<P>The truth is they probably envy you. In my experience most people fear
success because with success comes change and that can be too much for some
people. So before you totally ignore them ask them want they want out of
life, I'll guarantee most people will say - more money, more time with their
family and so on. Sound familiar, one thing you can do to help them out is
invite them along to see what you're doing and how it can help them.
</P>
<P>That's one of the most satisfying and rewarding aspects of this business I
find is helping others achieve their dreams. I used to worry so much what
other people thought about what I was doing, and soon realised it was
getting me nowhere. I was still stuck in the same space, still feeling
frustrated, I soon realised I had to stop worrying (as quite frankly, it is
really none of my business what other people think of me) and focus on what
I wanted and go for it. That's exactly what I'm doing and I love it!
</P>
<P>I read a brilliant saying once: Choose a job you love and you'll never have
to work a day in your life.</P>

<P>Right now I'm sitting here in the comfort of my home while my daughter is
asleep, I've made myself a nice pot of coffee and I'm writing this. When I
worked for a boss I very rarely got time to sit down and have a coffee, and
certainly never got the opportunity to be creative. This brings me to
another important point- this whole business thing has given me the chance
to explore areas of myself I didn't even know existed for example, being
creative - writing copy and designing web pages, developing my own system to
work within and so on. It's so very exciting and rewarding.</P>

<P>Fortunately for me I'm the sort of person that welcomes change, I hold on to
this thought… I don't want to go through the rest of my life wondering what
it would be like to have more time, more money and a feeling of total
satisfaction with what I'm doing'. In addition to that a feeling of
contribution. I want to be living it every day of my life.</P>

<P>You can do it too, you just need belief, belief in yourself, to be clear
about your dreams and goals and courage…the courage to change.</P>
