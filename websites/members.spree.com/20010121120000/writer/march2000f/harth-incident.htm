"What are you doing with my dog?"  Belinda asked.
<P align=justify>  Only by luck had she had found her way to this clearing where a small, gray,
 smiling, oriental man sat on an enormous and beautifully embroidered ground
 sheet holding Harpo in his arms.  An ancient looking oriental woman, was
 throwing a rope over a low-hanging branch.
<P align=justify>  "They're going to eat Harpo." A breath of thin air from Georgie.  Head down,
 face pale above her grubby shirt and jeans, she stood awkwardly apart from the
 elderly couple with tears in her eyes.  She adored the golden retriever pup,
 had fought against her mom's need to sell him.  Belinda, who bought him, took
 on the girl as his trainer, promising to pay her by bringing the pup and her
 on her next business trip to Chicago.  Georgie dreamed of showing her dad her
 talents as a handler.  These would bring him back to Wisconsin to set up a
 breeding kennel again.
<P align=justify>  "I can explain everything." said her dad.  Walt slouched beside her,
 whistling softly to himself, hands in pockets  His ruggedly handsome face,
 smiling and assured, showed unlikely white teeth.
<P align=justify>  "I want my dog.  Harpo, come."  Belinda's tone of command was right.  The
 puppy struggled to obey, but he could not free himself.
<P align=justify>  "My dog.  I buy him from this gentleman."  The old man gave Belinda yet
 another smile and tossed a bow in Walt's direction.
<P align=justify>  "He can't sell Harpo.  The pup's mine," she said.  She should never have let
 Georgie and her dad take Harpo for a walk, however hard Georgie begged for a
 small patch of time alone with her dad.
<P align=justify>  "This you and the gentleman can argue.  I paid cash for my dog."  The old man
 never lost his smiling politeness.
<P align=justify>  The woman said something unintelligible.  She had made a noose and set up a
 gallows on the branch.
<P align=justify>  "I won't let you hang him."  This from an Eurasian boy of about eleven,
 Georgie's age, who sat by the old gentleman petting the pup.
<P align=justify>  "Hang him?" Belinda repeated incredulously.
<P align=justify>  "Dear lady, to barbecue a living dog is not kind," the old gentleman told
 her.  He rose with Harpo in his arms.
<P align=justify>  Belinda grabbed for the gallows, and with a swift, almost unfelt blow, the
 old woman knocked her down.
<P align=justify>  Walt ran over to help her up, "According to these folks, dog-barbecues are an
 old home custom, for high types like them," he said. At this he made his own
 clumsy bow in the direction of the old man who bowed back.  "Their son over
 there with the book is a prof. at the University of Chicago, and you don't see
 him getting excited."  A middle aged oriental man continued to lie on his
 stomach opposite the old man, ignoring the others as if, like Thoreau which he
 was reading, he were alone in the forest.
<P align=justify>  Belinda gasped.  "Are you people out of your minds?  You can't eat Harpo."
<P align=justify> She tried to speak calmly, as if dealing with a rational persons. The old
 gentleman walked easily toward the gallows with the sixty pound pup in his
 arms.  Harpo loved rides, and nobody much gave them to him any more.  He was
 licking the old man's chin.
<P align=justify>  Walt squeezed Belinda's arm, pushing her toward the woods beyond the
 clearing.  "Look, I'm trying to teach this rough mutt some ordinary obedience,
 and for a thank-you, it runs to these folks.  They want to take it off my
 hands, and good riddance I say.  Next time Georgie breeds her bitch, you can
 have the pick, and I'll also refund half Harpo's price because he wasn't as
 great a dog as Georgie thought.  That's fair, so let's move."
<P align=justify>  "Not without Harpo." Belinda wrenched herself from his grasp, adding, "And
 he's beautifully trained for six-months."
<P align=justify>  "Seen better.  Now don't get me mad enough to tell your fat Darwin about us
 in the old days--and every time you come to Chicago."
<P align=justify>  "You wouldn't dare tell such lies," she said with shaky dignity.  Darwin
 would never believe all that.  Would he?  A sexy guy, women had flocked to
<P align=justify> Walt the way dogs did, but she had had enough of his lies by the time she was
 out of her teens.  She would not have minded a bit of fun with him in Chicago
 this trip, but at the last minute Darwin's brother Karl decided to ride along
 with Georgie and her to attend some veterinarian's conference where he could
 get drunk without effort or reproach.  Just as well.  She always had to pay
 too much for anything that looked like fun.
<P align=justify>  The old man reached his wife, and with gentle murmurs to Harpo, he started to
 edge the home-made gallows around the puppy's neck. He then shrieked, tumbling
 to the ground among some thorny lotus where he sat rubbing his scratched
 hands.  The gallows waved above his head, and a cloud of angry sounds hovered
 over the spot where his grandson had tackled him.
<P align=justify> The man reading Thoreau turned his head toward the mélée.  "Bobby, show proper
 respect," he said.  His quiet words spoken, he began to read again.
<P align=justify>  Harpo squeezed out of the heap under the gallows and ran to Belinda.  He
 threw his front paws up on her chest with an enthusiasm that almost knocked
 her over.  He had somehow recovered his leash, and he presented it to her,
 sitting down and looking up at her with his most engaging smile.
<P align=justify>  "What a good Harpo." Belinda attached the leash, seeing Karl behind some
 bushes as she bent to do it.  She always had known Karl was a wimp like his
 brother, but even Darwin would assert himself when she was so clearly in the
 right.  Now that she had Harpo, she decided to grab Georgie and get out of
 there fast.  "OK kiddo. We're hopping it.  And right now," she said to the
 girl.
<P align=justify>  "Not so fast," said Walt, grabbing Belinda's arm.  Harpo growled, jumped up
 and closed his teeth over Walt's hand without actually biting it.
<P align=justify>  "Stand back, you stupid mutt."  Walt caught folds of skin on either side of
 Harpo's neck, held his head steady, and stared into his eyes.  Harpo wiggled
 to avoid that look, but Walt's dark eyes won, and the dog lay down obediently
 with his head between his paws.
<P align=justify>  "And stay," Walt said, his entire attention still fixed on the pup.
 Belinda, in that instant, rammed her knee into Walt as hard as she could, a
 gesture learned in a Women's Defense course at the YMCA.
<P align=justify>  Walt staggered back and fell.
<P align=justify>  The prone professor, distracted from his reading, found a stray leaf to mark
 his place, set down his book, and rose.
<P align=justify>  Bobby got to him first.  "People don't barbecue dogs in this country."
<P align=justify>  "At home, most respectable people would consider your rudeness to your
 grandparents much more shocking."
<P align=justify>  "But we're here, and in Chicago such gross things don't happen."
  "Your grandparents only want to assert legal custody over this dog without
 interference from an ill-mannered child."
<P align=justify>  "No custody lets you have a dog for dinner in America.  Why can't you act
 like an American?  I was born here, and you're a professor here."  Bobby's
 face took on lines of stubbornness.
<P align=justify>  "I follow the customs of the country I am in, but your honored grandparents
 are recent arrivals, and age gives prerogatives."
<P align=justify>  "You're letting them be weird.  People don't...."
<P align=justify>  "Each culture has its sentimental prejudices.  This one loves dogs."
<P align=justify>  Belinda could not help but interfere.  Georgie, during Harpo's training, had
 taught her a new respect for canines.  "Hold it right there: a dog is a
 sensitive, feeling creature, very much like a human in a lot of ways.  You
 can't treat a dog like he's a piece of meat."  Her face flushed with a rare
 sense of having scored a serious moral point.  She hoped Karl heard.  He was
 always making speeches about how fine dogs were, but when push came to shove,
 he hid in the bushes.
<P align=justify>  The professor bowed politely. "The same may be said of a pig.  Or a cow.  Or
 a lamb.  That great prophet of your argument--that British animal doctor whose
 name escapes me--brings tears to Bobby's eyes when his exploits appear on
 television.  But Bobby and the animal doctor eat meat with pleasure.  Like
 Bobby, I am sure the animal doctor eats no dogs, which simply means that he
 partakes, like Bobby, of a Western cultural prejudice."
<P align=justify>  Belinda knelt, and acting out a heroine's role thoroughly, she put her arms
 around Harpo, gazed steadily into the professor's eyes, and said, "Call it
 what you like: eating dogs is wrong."
<P align=justify>  The elderly couple closed in on their son with loud voices and flying
 gestures.  He shrugged and turned to Belinda.
<P align=justify>  "My parents, quite naturally, are upset and want to leave.  They also would
 be pleased with a return of the absurd amount of money they gave to fulfill
 this whim of theirs."  His smile was apologetic.
<P align=justify>  Belinda looked around.  No Walt.  He had slipped away with the money.  She
 drew herself up.  "Walt stole my dog, and in this country, if a person buys
 stolen property, when the owner reclaims it, the buyer must suffer the loss."
<P align=justify> Her stuffy instruction on American law sounded like an echo of Darwin.
<P align=justify>  "That man said this dog was born at his kennel, of his bitch."
<P align=justify>  "He has no kennel.  Or bitch.  The family he abandoned does a little backyard
 breeding, and I bought this puppy at five weeks.  Georgie over there is Walt's
 daughter, and she can tell you who owns Harpo."  Her voice reflected the
 confidence she felt.
<P align=justify>  Georgie moved slowly toward the adults, without looking at Belinda, and said,
 "Harpo's champion stock, and he's mine.  I'd never sell him to her, but I told
 my dad he could sell him to who he wanted."
<P align=justify>  Belinda repressed a squeal in her throat.  "Georgie, that's an outright
 lie.   Do you want Harpo eaten?   The ungrateful brats delusions about her
 rotten dad had pushed aside all decent feelings, it seemed.
<P align=justify>  "I've seen them eat dogs after they hang them.  The whole thing makes you
 totally sick," Bobby broke in.
<P align=justify>  "Tough if you're sick.  Harpo's our dog, not hers.  You saw him do a
 down-stay instead of biting my dad.  He wouldn't do that for her."  The
 professor smiled politely at Belinda and said, "Whether or not it is fitting
 to barbecue dogs, we are at odds about who owns this particular one.
<P align=justify> Believing they do, my parents now intend to give it to my son, and your
 cultural prejudice cannot object to such a conclusion to our difficulty."
<P align=justify>  "I have nothing against your son, or your parents, but see my point: I bought
 and raised this dog from puppyhood.  He's mine, and he goes with me."
<P align=justify>  "This girl says otherwise, and in my experience of children's lies, they tell
 them softly, from the side of their mouths.  They do not declaim them.  With
 all respect, and without prejudice, I incline to believe her."
<P align=justify>  "I believe her too," Bobby put in.
<P align=justify>  Belinda imagined the boy all at once realizing he might soon have a golden
 retriever puppy of his very own.  Fine, but he was not getting her dog.
<P align=justify> "Harpo's identification tag has my name and address on it," she said.
<P align=justify>  "Anyone can buy a tag.  My dad owns that dog, not her," Georgie said.
<P align=justify>  "Let us examine this specific tag, shall we?" The professor said.
<P align=justify>  Belinda's fingers stretched through Harpo's fluffy ruff and down among his
 jingling tags.  His rabies tag and his county license still hung from his
 collar.  No identification tag at all.
<P align=justify>  "I see no such tag," said the professor after looking on his own.
<P align=justify>  "Walt must have pulled it off.  Never mind, Harpo's veterinarian is with us
 today, and he'll tell you I own him.  We should go over to our picnic spot and
 see if Dr. Everly is back.  He's crazy about Georgie, but he won't lie for her
 sake about Harpo's ownership."
<P align=justify>  Georgie grabbed the professor's arm.  "She and that vet are in a gang of
 dognappers.  Don't go with her, or they'll shoot you.  My dad snuck away with
 Harpo, trying to save his own property, and I went after him before they could
 catch me, but if you go you'll be lying on the ground in a bloody pool.  Stone
 dead."
<P align=justify>  Bobby's father removed her hand gently.  "Steady, steady, my dear young
 lady.  I think we should speak to this veterinarian gentleman," he said.
  Belinda, in a soaring moment of joy, knew Harpo was safe.  A frantic and
 woebegone waif like Georgie, whose dark eyes beneath her swollen eyelids now
 glittered wildly, could not convince a university professor, a man trained to
 judge evidence.   Women lied for guys like Walt--she had done it herself years
 ago--but he was scum, and Georgie would grow up as bad unless she threw out
 her dreams and faced the real world the way Belinda had had to do.  Georgie
 had to figure out who her real friends were, or Belinda would never let her
 near Harpo again.  She was not even a professional trainer, only a cheap one.
<P align=justify>  A few papers littered the crushed down yellowing grass of the site where
 Karl sat against a large silver maple, his head on his chest, apparently
 dozing.  He had hidden when she needed him, but at least he could tell the
 truth now.  He fluttered open his eyes and looked about him vaguely.  He had
 not been asleep.  His shoulders were too tight.  His eyes too nervous.
<P align=justify>  "What did you do with my dad?"
  "Poor little Georgie.  Your dad never came back,"  Karl said with the easy
 sentimentality Belinda hated in him when he was drunk.
<P align=justify>  "Dr. Everly, will you please settle something."  She wished Karl would get up
 and impress the professor with his cool professional manner.
<P align=justify>  "You are Dr. Everly?" The professor asked this peering down at what Belinda
 saw as a rather rumpled looking young drunk.
<P align=justify>  "My identification's in the van over there."  He scrambled up and headed for
 it, followed by Belinda to whom he whispered, "Harpo's safe, and proving
 Walt's a con artist could hurt Georgie horribly."
<P align=justify>  "Georgie has to know what he is, or she'll grow up just like him.  She's so
 bad already, she would have let those people eat Harpo."
<P align=justify>  "Yes, she loves her dad that much.  But I'd have stopped them."
<P align=justify>  "By hunkering down in the bushes like you were?"
<P align=justify>  "They changed their minds, anyway.  I'd have bought back Harpo, and I'd have
 told Georgie her dad returned the money.  You blew my whole plan."
<P align=justify>  "I don't believe you had a plan."
<P align=justify>  The professor, growing impatient, called out,  "Never mind the
 identification.  This woman says the dog is hers.  Is that so?"
<P align=justify>  Karl glanced at frantic-eyed Georgie.  "I guess so."
<P align=justify>  "You guess?"
<P align=justify>  "That's just a way of speaking.  Yes, she owns him."
<P align=justify>  "Those two are robbers.  Like Bonnie and Clyde they're in it together, and
 they're out to kill my dad.  Don't let them get away with it.  Don't.
 Don't."  Georgie threw herself to the ground and belted it with her fists.
<P align=justify> Karl knelt beside her and whispered something.  Belinda gave the two a
 disgusted glance and turned her back on them.
<P align=justify>  "Let me offer you my deepest apologies for this unfortunate incident," the
 professor said to Belinda with a flicker of a bow.
<P align=justify>  Victory warmed Belinda's blood, making her gracious.  "I'm also sorry...about
 everything...about your parents' money, but not about...."
<P align=justify>  "Yes, of course, my dear lady.  I understand you perfectly, and I wish you a
 good afternoon."
<P align=justify>  He left the clearing without hesitation, and the bushes closed quietly behind
 him.  Belinda leaned down and hugged Harpo.  She pretended to herself she
 could not hear, behind her, the moaning child clutching to herself the only
 dream she ever had had.
