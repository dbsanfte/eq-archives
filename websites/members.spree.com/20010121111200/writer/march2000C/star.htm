Donny Hero/portrait of the birth of an artist
</CENTER>
<BR>
<pre>

Invincible Spirit

Donny I am, blessed  poor young man
Child of milleniums demise giving way to holy rise
The son of a sailor, whose father's one too
From the dream lands of Ireland the fair-winds did blew
My bread and my butter spread'n cover to cover
With starry eyes glazed and Saturday cartoons
I'll bounce all around like the gummy-yum bears
After drinks from a chalice or scientist's beaker's
I once was the master of my own Universe
In lands of Hyrule such a wizard -such a curse
 Now lost in the playhouse -twixt dot to dot 
A picture-less place with no time or no spot
Yet mysteries I solve in the blink of an eye 
As I tear away masks with my dog at my side
And locate that harbor somewhere safe inside
So your welcome to join us away on this ride
Through each page one step closer to treasures and gold
Within them a treasure-map someday'll be old
And covered with cobwebs as so soon will I
But the Invincible spirit'll still burn on alive!
</pre>

<P align=justify>
	And so the ever disillusioned and desperately romantic Donny Queen sets down what has become 

his final stand; that magicians wand of light for all this darkness of all of the sudden it has gone so terribly 

wrong.  He rests his trouble-making head against the base of the weeping-willow and sighs with the waves 

of the EERIE Lake so brown and hazy.  There's a feeling of impending change hovering near, like a dark 

cloud or a hungry hawk; an ending like that that comes to the desperate white butterflies of the endless 

summer, time to move on…to somewhere else…but where to now? Who will go there with me now that 

she's left me so alone and cold?   And such is the state that we find our hero; ill and depleted from the 

sudden fall from that sweet paradise of once upon a time and only once, love no more.  Half a decade, a 

ring, a family, and love, love, love, now gone, just like that - a dream.  Left forever to face the indifferent 

chill of a wasteland world of fragments falling to pieces.  Everything feeling so dead, so pointless, 

everyone on their way away to someplace else.  Welcome to the city of darkness of mind and heart to be 

broken again and again by this cruel world spinning by too fast.  Goodbye trust, so long faith, goodbye to

all those safe yesterdays, gone now those days, gone with a heart no longer young and gay.  Goodbye to 

all the now distant evenings of sweet attention, dream spinning together, the comfort of a shared 

tomorrow-a family and a normal life - no alarms or surprises, just the gentle nothingness of love on the 

couch and the hummmm of t.v. - all her favorite shows in that sweet sanctuary of attention.  Goodbye and 

goodnight says that hag time as she decides to perish such things, so you best keep swimming Don 

and try to keep up with the currents of today.
<P align=justify>
Donny still so confused and trying to figure out what the hell happened, -still wondering why? 

why did she leave? And even worse not even a year and already hitched!  She's getting married, my freek'n  

princess married!? -and marriage the reason for the beginning of all these problems anyway - 'Donny I 

swear I'm gonna leave you if we're not engaged by the end of next year, that's it, that's the deadline!' and 

when finally with boyish excitement a ring he produces followed by a proposal in the Marshland - it's she 

don't want you no more - oh woman, you strange creature, fickle fiend, the essence of it all.  Donny takes 

comfort in the miracle that he was able to hold on for so long anyway and forces out a chuckle.  They grew 

rivers apart.  In fact it was as if something inside her had always clutched to the wild hope for some 

miracle, like Don winning the lottery or actually finishing school on time and getting 'a real job' to 

her liking.  Or maybe he'd finally become a man and leave all of the friends and their many madcap nights 

of searching for what he had had already behind.  But perhaps it wasn't even her fault, his fault or anyone's 

fault, perhaps she was as much a victim of time as young Don.  For there seems to come a time for all to 

awake from the beautiful rubbish of perished dreams and move on.   But what dreams!  The dreams, the 

nightmares, the visions, hallucinations, always greeted with 'don ya ass your wasting all your damn time on 

these dreams, poesy's dead, remember…you're a movie baby, how the hell do you expect to ever make any 

money acting like this!  You need to wake up Don, wake up before it's too late.'  If only he could wake up 

from such dreams, but it's not so easy; the dreams have begun to leak out from within their frame, spilling 

forever into the fabric of the real. And it is from these sacred nightmare illusions that Don 

realizes his mission.  It was that first dreary dream in that time of brightest darkness, the one that told him 

he was to become a writer, or poet, or vates, the one that told him he would expose something.  It haunted 

him wherever he went, it infested his every thought like a virus that encompasses a host.  Experience 

thereafter would become part of a thickening plot, a plot that would eventually involve the lives of several 

close companions whom he would lead on a deranged crusade, altering their lives forever.
<P align=justify>
	    And so equipped with broken-hearted dream-a-vision Desperate Donny Queen was ready to be 

born.   He came to life in hot-summer afternoons of nothing left to do, on long, lonely hikes through the 

Marshlands and the trail-side museum, or in the hazy grass blowi'n fields of dandelion gold amidst the 

summer butterflies and wind sighs.  Or even in the secluded shade of a weeping willow on the lake as is 

now as he adds some finishing touches to the beginning of his epoch prose/poetry tale.

        Invincible you ask?

	And to what exactly?

	Vice of the Streets and Exuberant feasts

	Served from the platter that gluttonous beast

	His belly it grows and it grows and it knows

	Of darkness innumerable, not even a glow

	So spirits a tattered, and spirits fatigued

	Saddle your baggy-eyes come ride on this steed

	As it flees from the darkness now only behind

	And crusades towards that monster….

	We'll kick his behind!!

<P align=justify>
That's it, that's it our mission's clear now.  Or so he thinks, does Donny as he files the 

sloppy poetry/prose manuscripts into his giant duffle-bag, he props the bag atop shoulders and strolls over 

to his car. That damn car. Made him a freek'n slave for the past four years..and for what?  Don checks the 

time and to his surprise finds that a whole bunch of it has slipped on by while writing.  He is supposed to 

meet Captain Insano at a great little diner on the end of town.  
<P align=justify>

	So it is time to meet the Captain -'Ladies and Gentlemen this is your Captain Speaking, Oh 

Captain My Captain out to derange the senselessness of the motherbrain! Surf and Rip the Curl and when 

you catch that wave you better Ride that son ova bitch!'  Captain Insano the artist, or one can say art 

student, artist/art student, mad decacat howeling beast yodels at the moon, whatever the description Donny 

knows him as art; a walking talking work in motion. A frazzled frantic creator dreaming out-loud wherever 

he goes.  Donny met the Captain when they worked together at the Wooly Mammoth Grocery store.  They 

both worked in the produce department, and boy oh boy did they ever produce.  When their starving 

heads clashed it was certain chaos for the outside world, work together became "goof-time" - or time to lol 

at all this madness, this crazy old-world.  A few of their routines consisted of the following activities: there 

were the intentionally lame, incoherent announcements of advertisements from within the store such as 

-"That's right the secrets out! Now you know what crazy old uncle Ned puts in that Thanksgiving dish, 

yep, It's Produce Partner's Yam Glaze!" and so on and so forth.  There were also countless times of the 

Capt. waiting for Donny to begin working on the floor, when he did, from within the back-room 

would come the most hideous animalistic noises imaginable.  Sometimes Insano went so far as to parade 

around the store wearing a Watermelon mask antagonizing customers. Another time he even gave birth to 

a life-sized cyclops from a collection of cardboard which he propped up against the produce dept. 

doors, where above he hung a sign reading:  "BEWARE OF THE CYCLOPS".  When consumers came by 

and observed the demented craftsmanship they would of course be left to hear the sounds of some old 

broken-hearted cyclops bemoaning from within!  Any time Don and the Captain got together it 

just felt as if there was hope, the hope of a new day, to see the world for the first-time again, through eyes a 

dreamin, those insano eyes.  And that is what happened when they met, for the first time in his young 

adult life Donny knew exactly what he wanted…to be an artist like Insano, a magician, vates, a mason of 

bricks to paradise.
