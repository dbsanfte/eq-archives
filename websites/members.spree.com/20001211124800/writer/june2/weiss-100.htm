	<P>
"Wonder how things would have turned out if the North had won the war"?  This question has been asked thousands of times over the years.  What would have happened to all of the slaves?  Would they have been sent back to Africa?  Would they have massacred the whites and burned and looted and pillaged and destroyed everything?  Would the country have been reunited and stayed together or would another civil war have broken out later?  Would Canada be an independent country?  An interesting topic to speculate on, but the fact is that the South won the war. Let's review how things developed over the years 1863 -- 1962. 
</P>
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN="center"><U>TIME LINE</U></DIV>	
<BR>
<U>1863	</U>
<BR>
<LI> General Pickett's charge at Gettysburg breaks through the Union line and sends the Army of the Potomac into full retreat back toward Washington.  Ten days later General Lee's army attacks the Washington defense line and forces another retreat toward Baltimore.  Lee's army stages a victory parade on Pennsylvania Avenue as the Union government flees to Philadelphia.  Maryland secedes from the Union and joins the CSA.</LI>	
<BR><BR>
<LI> Anti-war riots spread throughout the North.  Congress demands that Lincoln resign.  Gen. Sherman appointed commander of new Union 'Army of the Delaware' -- vows to re-take Washington.  In first battle south of Baltimore Lee's troops prevail again.  Lee captures Baltimore and Philadelphia.  Congress flees to Albany and secretly sends emissaries to President Davis requesting peace terms.</LI>	
<BR><BR>
<BR>
<U>1864	</U>
<BR><BR>
<LI> Northern armies throughout the South suffer losses.  Confederate armies capture Nashville, Memphis, and New Orleans ending the threat in the West.</LI>	
<BR><BR>
<LI> Congress demands that President Lincoln accept the terms for peace offered by Davis.  Lincoln refuses and states that the North must fight on no matter what territory is lost.  Secretary of War Staunton stages coup and deposes Lincoln -- calls on Davis to meet to discuss peace.  Lincoln escapes to Ohio, forms a new government and calls on Gen. Sherman to invade Virginia's Shenandoah Valley to force Lee to pull back.  </LI>	
<BR><BR>
<LI> Sherman's invasion of Virginia fails as most of his troops desert or start fighting among themselves.  President Lincoln is assassinated by a disgruntled member of his bodyguard</LI>	
<BR><BR>	
	<OL>§ All Union armies must return to their states and disarm.</OL><BR>
	<OL>§ Blockades of southern ports and all interference with shipping must cease. </OL>
	<OL>§ All slaves must be returned to their masters</OL>
	<OL>§ Reparations of $50 million must be paid to compensate for war damages.</OL>
	<OL>§ West Virginia must be returned to Virginia.</OL>
	<OL>§ Washington, DC would be reabsorbed into Maryland</OL>
	<OL>§ Missouri would become a slave state and join the CSA.</OL>
	
	<BR><BR>
	<LI> 'President' Staunton and Congress accept the terms, and the 'official' war is over.     Rioters burn Northern cities.  Mob of Union soldiers returning from the south surrounds statehouse in Albany demanding that Staunton resign and appoint Gen. McClellan president.  McClellan announces that he is assuming command of all Union armies -- calls on Gen. Sherman to acknowledge his command.  </LI>
	<BR><BR>
	<LI> Under pressure from all sides Staunton renounces the presidency.  McClellan proclaims himself president and imposes martial law.  General Lee's army remains in northern Pennsylvania until McClellan affirms his intention to honor the peace treaty and all of its terms.</LI>
	<BR><BR>
	<LI> Jubilant Confederate armies pursue Union troops into Missouri, Kansas, and Oklahoma territory.  Missouri secedes and joins CSA.</LI>
	<BR><BR>
	<LI> CSA signs trade agreement with Great Britain under which GB agrees to prevent any blockade of southern ports.</LI>
	<BR><BR>
	<LI> The Union imposes a trade embargo against the CSA, continues to harass southern shipping in violation of the treaty.  The CSA calls on GB for help.  GB pays lip service to the problem but does nothing to intervene.</LI>
	<BR><BR>
	<U>1865</U>
	<BR>
	<LI> With the departure of Union troops peace returns to the southern states, and life begins to return to normal as the process of re-building begins.</LI>
	<BR><BR>
	<LI> The northern states are in a state of complete disarray with a military government, widespread lawlessness, and political turmoil at every level of state and local government.  Talk of fomenting revolution is heard everywhere.  </LI>
	<BR><BR>
	<LI> During the heat of the summer a group of slaves revolts in South Carolina.  Thousands of slaves leave their plantations and go on rampages in Charleston, Beaufort, and other towns.  The army is called out to meet the challenge.  As the rioting slaves are driven out of the towns they burn and pillage the plantations, murdering whites and raping the women.  When they are captured, the army treats them more and more harshly in an effort to intimidate the slaves into submission.  Slaves are whipped and tortured before being hung from trees.  </LI>
	<BR><BR>
	<LI> The army is finally successful in suppressing the slave revolt.  More oppressive restrictions are imposed on slaves throughout the south to prevent any more outbreaks.</LI>
	<BR><BR>
	<U>1866</U>
	<BR>
	<LI> McClellan's military government promises new elections for later this year.  Mid-Western states, fed-up with domination by the eastern states and with widespread corruption, consider seceding to form a Mid-West Confederation.  Ohio leads the way announcing its secession.  Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin follow within a few months.  McClellan's government is powerless to oppose the secessions, and the mid-west states hold a convention to form their new confederation.</LI>
	<BR><BR>
	<LI> The CSA tries to negotiate an alliance with Mexico aimed at dividing up New Mexico, Arizona, and California and thus expanding from the Atlantic to the Pacific.  California forestalls this attempt by an agreement with Mexico that returns the lower third of California, and Arizona to Mexico in return for Mexico's support in resisting CSA penetration to the West.</LI>
	<BR><BR>
	<LI> California secedes from the Union and announces its intention to take over the Oregon Territory as well.  The CSA, stymied by the California/Mexico pact, moves to take over the eastern half of Arizona Territory.</LI>
	<BR><BR>
	<U>1867</U>
	<BR>
	<LI> The Union states have been reduced to only the Northeast, and in addition to the CSA there are now two new confederations in the Mid-West and Far West.  The stage is set for competition for the largely unsettled central western territories bounded by the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada.</LI>
	<BR><BR>
	<U>1868</U>
	<BR>
	<LI> Elections are held in the remaining Union states, the CSA, and in the new Mid-West and West confederations.  Gen. McClellan is elected president of the 'Union' and Gen. Lee is elected President of the CSA.  Gen. Sherman is elected president of the Mid-West confederation and Gen. Fremont is elected president in the West.  Thus, the entire territory of the USA is governed by military men.</LI>
	<BR><BR>
	<LI> Conflicts develop between the CSA and the Mid-West confederation over the use of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers.  The CSA demands that duties be paid for goods transported on the Mississippi south of Illinois.  CSA gunboats attack and sink MW gunboats near Cape Girardeau.  MW agrees to pay duties.</LI>
	<BR><BR>
	<LI> Farmers in northern and western Missouri revolt and swear allegiance to the Mid-West confederation.  The state militia mutinies and throws in its lot with the Mid-West in support of the farmers.  The CSA threatens war but does nothing to squash the rebellion.  Missouri is effectively partitioned into sections loyal to the CSA and sections loyal to the Mid-West.  The Missouri River becomes the new dividing line.  

</LI>
<BR><BR>
<U>1869</U>
	<BR>
	<LI> Slaves escaping across the border and receiving sanctuary in the Union and MW states lead to incursions by CSA troops into Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Illinois.  McClellan orders his army to resist, and battles break out near York and Frederick.  Lee opposes calls for mobilization of an army to invade the North once again.  South Carolina offers to send its state militia to do the job, but Lee would not permit it.  The runaway slave problem would continue to be a chronic irritation between the CSA and its neighbors.</LI>
	<BR><BR>
	<U>1870</U>
	<BR>
	<LI> Boll weevils destroy much of the cotton crop across the southern states.  The CSA economy sinks into a depression.  Without cotton to export the huge plantations could not support all of their slaves.  Slave markets were full of slaves but no buyers.  Slaves were being driven off the plantations to find ways to take care of themselves.  Many of them turned to stealing food and property.  Any who were caught were hung.  Lee's government was under pressure to establish camps where excess slaves could be held at government expense rather than being turned loose.  Lee reluctantly agreed to the camps.  By the end of the year there were over a million slaves in the camps.  Many of them died of starvation, disease, and exposure or the problem would have been worse.  </LI>
	
	<BR><BR>
	<U>1875</U>
	<BR>
	<LI> The West confederation resolves border dispute with Canada by sending troops to capture Vancouver and Prince Rupert on the coast and taking over inland settlements in British Columbia and Alberta.</LI>
	<BR><BR>
	<U>1876</U>
	<BR>
	<LI> Seeing the weakness of Canada in her failure to successfully defend its western territory, the MidWest confederation sends armies into Ontario capturing Ottawa and Toronto.</LI>
	<BR><BR>
	<LI> The expansion of the West and Mid-West confederations into Canada leads the Union states in the northeast to seek expansion to the north as well.  Negotiations lead to Nova Scotia and Newfoundland agreeing to join the Union.  Thus squeezed between the Mid-West confederation and the Union the Quebecois try to gain access to the sea by sending troops down the St. Lawrence and into Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.  The Union determines to defend its new territories vigorously, and the 'French Canadian' war begins. </LI>
