<P>Not far from Rock Creek, on the Flat River, around 1930 a couple of
smart fellas from the city decided to excavate large quantities of
sand for the cement that made the new highways crossing the state. This
sand dredging excavation was a successful business all the way through
the early 60's when the interstate highway was completed then the need
for that much sand in that part of the state dried up. The hole left by
the excavating process did not dry up however. No, in fact it filled
up. After 3 years, the sand pit reached a sort of stasis and was
completely filled with clear water and soon after, young aquatic life. Some of
the folks in town thought it would make a nice park and lake, much to
the disappointment of the local teens who used it as a swimming hole
and make-out place.</P>

<P>It made quite a nice park and lake. And the deep cool water was
ideal
for growing very large fish of all manner of species. Young
children and
old men fished the reeds and shallows for the sunfish and bluegill,
adventurous young men fished the various points for largemouth
bass, and
wily stodgers fished the depths for lake trout and muskie. A very
fine
body of water indeed, and it did itself proud with the quality of
its'
fish.</P>

<P>Rock Creek has always had a generous supply of youths who enjoy the
outdoors and the adventures to be had there. Even now, there are
scads of boys who prefer real-live fishing over the hand-held
computerized variety. These boys congregate at the old ball diamond each morning
after breakfast and play baseball until the sun gets high and hot,
then they jump on their fancy mountain and BMX bikes and peddle like
heck over to the sandpit for a dip in the swimming area. Sufficiently
cooled,  they usually can scrounge up enough money for a big bag of nacho
chips and a soda, which they consider fine luncheon fare, and then their
free and daring spirit takes them on a daily adventure. They know enough
to stay off the Rock Creek. The Locals would take turns blistering
their hides if they caught the boys doing anything worse than jumping
from the
railroad trestle into the trestle pool or riding innertubes down
the small rapids that connect the best trout spots. No, they tend to
emigrate up the lesser creeks and the Flat River itself.
</P>
<P>The Flat being in fact so flat, you can most often walk entirely
across it and not get the top of your socks wet. There are far more
interesting places for boys who haven't yet met puberty and have the hearts of
conquerors. Muddy Creek is a great example. It cuts deeply through
farmland, with its high banks and overhanging trees, it's a natural
tunnel that through the whole summer will stay cool and shaded. And
perfectly quiet and out of the way of parental supervision. It's
the kind of place a girlie magazine stolen from an older brother or a
cigarette stolen from a careless parent, can be shared amongst
curious kids. And it is no surprise that the boys show equal false
appreciation for both vices, not knowing what to make of a grown naked woman or
a lit cigarette. It was quite natural then that the boys eventually tire
of the hide and seek games, the dirt clod fights, and the games of
ninja-war and TV
wrestlers-who-takes-on-the-beings-from-outer-space. And
when they tire of these noble pursuits, they find some trouble to
get
into.</P>

<P>It was the James boy who brought up the idea of trying to see a
real-live girl naked, not some picture in a book. Little James was
approaching puberty, as his changing voice and too-short pants legs
would attest. The other boys, feeling similar stirrings in their
hormones, agreed to take part, if a good plan could be developed.
The
ground rules of a good plan are simple: It has to work and it
couldn't
get them into trouble. So the boys thought and planned and
eventually
discarded all the ideas except one.</P>

<P>The idea they decided to use was to ambush a swimmer back at the
sandpit and somehow remove her clothing. And in doing so, it had to look
accidental, and somehow all of the boys had to be able to be on
hand to reap the rewards. The girls who were already in college were
immediately crossed off the list. They could hurt a guy if they wanted to. The
high school girls were also eliminated because they had big scary
boyfriends
who would love to pummel some wise-guy punks for trying to mess
with their girls. That left the girls who were their own ages, and
already twice as far along the maturity scale as the perpetrators. They
narrowed the choices down to the
three girls they would most like to see bare and who they thought
they could fend off in a fair fight. Now they had a target, they needed
a method.</P>

<P>It was young James who thought up the idea if "fishing" for
bikinis.
Since fishing wasn't allowed in the swimming area, an accomplice
would
be needed. It was the Matthews boy who was selected to be the
underwater
counterpart. A thorough discussion followed. It would be too
obvious if
one of them reeled in the prize, so an dupe was going to be needed.
The
boys decided to reconnoiter the area and see if something might
develop.</P>
<P>
JoeHoehn was sleeping in his jonboat when the boys arrived back at
the
fishing area on the sandpit. And his jonboat wasn't too far from
the
swimming hole. Perfect. Now little Matthews was to swim out to
JoeHoehn's boat, release the bail on the reel, grab the hook and
tow it
back in, then sort of hangout by the outer buoys until a victim got
within his range of underwater swimming ability so he could swim
over
hook her suit and swim away without being detected.</P>

<P>Being detected would pretty much destroy the whole plan. So another
participant would be needed to occupy the victim in a water fight
or
other disturbance so that she would be less likely to detect
somebody
hooking her suit, and hopefully not her skin. The James boy took
upon
that task with a boy named DP.</P>

<P>The luck of the young put all elements in place for them so soon
that
they didn't have any time to chicken out. Matthews swam out and
released
the bail without JoeHoehn even stirring. He then took off
JoeHoehn's
bobber and bait and wrapper the line around a small stick to tow it
by.
It wouldn't do if JoeHoehn woke early and upon discovering his
bobber
missing, set the hook on young Matthews.</P>

<P>DP and the James kid began to "herd" Sissy Taylor towards deeper
water
by getting into a furious water fight. Sissy was only trying to
avoid
drowning as she waded deeper and deeper, the two boys constantly
maneuvering to keep her from returning safely to shore. Matthews
was
successful in hooking Sissy's flowered suit without her detection.
Another case of blind luck. He surfaced near the two combatants and
they
suddenly decided the water fight was over in a fit of nervous
giggling.
Now if JoeHoehn would wake up!</P>
<P>
Caleb, another of our youthful delinquents, shouted from his
shoreline
position, "Hey JoeHoehn, HOWSTHEFISHIN?!"</P>
<P>
This of course stirred JoeHoehn, and he immediately noted the
absence of his bobber and began to reel, not even noting the open bail. When
the slack was reel in, JoeHoehn had a helluva fight on his hands. He
was absolutely sure he had hooked a 30, no 40, no 50, NO 60 POUND
MUSKIE! He was going to be famous. He reeled for all he was worth. Missy
Taylor felt a tug at her bikini bottoms and immediately she wheeled to see
which little dweezil was going to "get it!" But she found it hard
to wheel around. She even found it hard to walk. In fact, she was
slipping  a little deeper into the water. She panicked and yelled for help.
At this point, the boys knew the plan had gone awry and their best
option was to quietly slip away. But being young boys, they had to see it
through. This was the most exciting thing in Rock Creek at the
moment, and they want to be there to witness it.</P>
<P>
JoeHoehn and Missy were at an impasse of sorts when JoeHoehn
noticed his
boat was drifting closer to the swimming area. Shouts from the
bathers
to warn him only got back his assurances that a state record muskie
was
going to be landed here. Today. NOW if he could help it.</P>

<P>Missy could still feel something powerful pulling at her bottoms,
but
she didn't dare let go of the sides to reach back and determine the
culprit. Now Missy's friends get involved. They answer her pleas
for
help, not at first knowing what the problem is. Missy was reluctant
to
shout it, so precious seconds were wasted while the rescuers "come
HERE!"</P>

<P>Upon hearing the dilemma their friend is in, they immediately
determine
the cause. JoeHoehn is barreling down on his prize as fast as he
can
reel.  The rescuers immediately wheel around to face JoeHoehn and
unleash the full fury of twelve year old womanhood. JoeHoehn is
taken
aback. Enough so the rescuers are able to get Missy out of her
bikini
bottoms. They fly out of the water and nearly slap JoeHoehn as they
whiz
by his head.</P>

<P>The full stages of shock, realization, and humiliation cross
JoeHoehn's
visage in seconds. He is far more embarrassed than the young girl,
fighting furiously to get the hook out so that they can be returned
to
the rightful owner.</P>
<P>
Missy quickly replaces her bottoms and strides out of the swimming
area,
clutching the sides to keep them in place. Back at her bag, she
slithers
into her shorts and T-shirt and goes straight home for a hot bath
and
comfort from her thoroughly confused mother.</P>

<P>JoeHoehn immediately paddles out of the swimming area and heads to
the
boat ramp to get the heck out of there. It is a full week before he
ventures into Clem's feed store and the full scale razzing he knew
all
along he had coming.</P>

<P>The culprits got away with their plan for exactly three days. Then
the
brag bug got the best of them and in telling the story to boys who
weren't there, they were overheard. All of the parents were
notified and
duly chagrined. No one saw much of those boys for several weeks.
And
when they did, they were usually hard at work mowing or painting or
stacking wood.</P>
<P>
Little Matthews mastered the art of riding his bike standing up. He
had
plenty of practice. He also had no desire whatsoever to sit down
for
more than a week.</P>
