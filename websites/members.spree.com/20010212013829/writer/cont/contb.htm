I was born & raised in Southern California,  where I still live with my 7-year-old son. I also have two other
sons, a daughter & two grandsons. I began writing poetry
spontaneously at the age of 13 (thirty years ago) & haven't been
able to stop yet.

Born & raised outside of Washington, DC in
Arlington, VA. My grandmother (who happens to be a very wonderful,
kind lady if you're ever in DC) raised me due to my mother's lack of
interest in any of her children's lives. I have never met my father.
I have written on a regular basis since childhood. 
<BR>
I am currently a high school teacher in the Tidewater area of
 Virginia. I teach three literature, two world history & one art
 history class. I graduated from the University of Virginia in 1996.
I am currently learning Russian at night with plans to some day get
a PhD in Russian Literature. My wife & I were married during a 21
hour trip to Las Vegas. We just celebrated our two year anniversary.

I believe I have always been a poet, it just took a
long time for me to proclaim it to myself. I am a seeker, tying the
truths of the world so that nothing can be excluded. I imagine this
is a longer than lifetime pursuit. Poetry is my way of expressing
life, revelation, and passion with some semblance of clarity. For
now, I manage & buy for an outfitting store, own & operate a
climbing shoe resoling business, & a myriad of other odd jobs to
keep the loose ends tied. I live when I am in the mountains, church
if you will, & pay for my stay in society by working in
Albuquerque.

A man for all seasons, Don has been a journalist,
editor, news announcer, disk jockey, photographer, photojournalist,
feature writer, pants presser for Lee Jeans, delivery car driver,
television personality and systems consultant. At times he has been
 sinner & saint, rich & poor, lost & found &
 always involved in what is going on. For redemption, Don
teaches part-time as an English professor at a local
Dallas university. Don has been a professional musician
for more than 20 years. His loves are painting, drawing
& writing. <BR>
He is educated. He admits to degrees in journalism,
business, English & other areas but sees little value
in them other than he managed to persevere to get his
sheepskin (fake) -- but his mother loved it. 
<BR>
Don is irreverent, testy, salty, holier than thou, opinionated,
 soft, hard as nails, inquisitive & totally undeterred by
establishment procedures. Writing: The majority of Don's work has
 been in the corporate designing training curriculum, marketing
collaterals, corporate presentations, speeches & public speaking.
However, before joining the corporate world Don wrote & edited for
a small newspaper <U>The Pittsburg Morning Sun</U> in Pittsburg, Kansas. He
later worked as a reported, editor & photographer with the <U>Tulsa
Tribune</U>. During that time, he was also a stringer for the <U>Wichita
 Eagle</U> & the <U>Kansas City Star</U>. Don's other work includes numerous
appearances in small art & poetry magazines and various opinion
columns.

	considers himself to be a "defrocked"
astrophysicist, having graduated with degrees in
physics & astronomy. In order to live, he took a job
 as a software engineer & has been at it since 1979.
 He used to write to help himself out during times of
depression. Interestingly enough, his life has
apparently been good for the last fifteen years. Of
course, having a family with two small children does
make it slightly difficult to keep up with any
 literary pursuits. So perhaps some encouragement from
some fans would spur his creative juices. Michael had
 originally published "Toll Road" in the <U>"The Cat's
Eye"</U>, a defunct ezine. He has recently published some
of his science fiction endeavors in the <U>Planet
 Magazine</U> ;, which currently contains a story "That
 Takes The Cake". <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/9634" TARGET="_blank">His Web site</A> has more of his writing,

 non-fiction, & religious humor pieces

 My main literary interest is in poetry, & I'm concerned with the great range
 of what is being written in the present. In my own experience of reading, & in writing
  for other web-zines, world-wide, I've come to see that there is a lot of poetry being 
 written in in these times. And
a lot of it is simply fantastic!
What is incomprehensible to me is that, although the market for poetry seems to be a hard sell,
 & that there seems to be a shrinking venue for poetry, in the paper world, there are at 
  the same time, more  people than ever reading and writing it. 
The glory of the Internet is that it's possible for publishers to provide venues for poetry at 
 a fraction of the cost of putting out a publicaton on paper. Thus, these
publications can afford to take risks on publishing the new and the unknown and the untried voices
out there, that a paper journal, with rising costs of materials and overhead, are sadly, unable to do.

	 began writing at age 10 when she submitted a short story to Golden Books for publication. She neglected to include her return address so she doesn't know if they accepted her manuscript or not. That didn't stop her, though.
As a self-educated writer from her early teens on, she devoured multitudes of books on writing principles and practiced every writing exercise in each of them. During college, she majored in business with a strong emphasis on writing. Later, her skills were used extensively in varied jobs from executive assistant to desktop publisher, and then to managing editor for a small, local newspaper.
Darlene's writing background includes articles for newspapers, magazines and online publications, press releases, newsletters, website content and much more. A number of her short pieces have been published in various offline publications, including Woman's Day, Penny Press, and Dell. She typically seeks to write for business, however, rather than publication, and has formed her own successful writing and editorial services company, Copeland & Lane (http://www.copelandlane.com), as a vehicle for employing these much needed skills.
