Daylight.  
<P align=justify>
Thousands of birds greeted her with late morning rays creeping around the 
shades. 
<P align=justify>
A day like any other day, she thought. 
<P align=justify>
No, it wasn't!  As she rubbed her eyes, she felt a small knot form in her 
stomach.  It was Sunday, and that meant Valentine's Day. 
<P align=justify>
She was glad not to be alone.  There was something about waking up with a 
warm body that she treasured.  The soft, rhythmic sounds of his breathing 
reassured her that all was well.  His head was halfway on her pillow, and she 
was grateful for the closeness.  She moved closer to him, rubbing her hands 
through the wisps at the top of his head and stroking his tummy, as she knew 
he enjoyed in the morning.  After burying her face in the strawberry blonde 
softness, she kissed his nose.  Slowly his large golden eyes opened, and 
stared at her with a drowsy expression all his own. 
<P align=justify>
He opened his mouth wide and yawned.  She watched in amusement as he 
stretched his arms and legs out before her.  Then Dexter opened his mouth and 
out spilled his first commentary on the 14th of February. 
<P align=justify>
Meow! 
<P align=justify>
As much as she enjoyed sleeping in with her cat on Sundays, there was no time 
to waste if she was to prepare for a beautiful romantic evening for her 
lover, Sweetie.
<BR>
<CENTER><HR></CENTER>
<BR><P align=justify>
She'd originally wanted to serve his favorite cuisine.  He delighted in 
French cooking and had taken her to several exquisite restaurants in the last 
few months, introducing her to myriad delicacies and oral treasures.  But 
French was really not an option.  How could she, an indifferent cook, compete 
with the chefs at restaurants that refused to list prices on the menus?  At 
least she never saw any prices.  No, it would have to be pasta!  Her 
grandmother was a Sicilian immigrant who'd given her several family recipes 
she'd mastered after years of practice. 
<P align=justify>
At the grocery store, she picked up a box of angel hair pasta with strands as 
fine as his sun-streaked, light brown hair.  Grandmother's homemade pesto 
sauce would be the perfect complement to lightly grilled marinated lemon 
chicken.  She made an exquisite Caesar Salad with garlic croutons, and a warm 
loaf of her Italian garlic bread would complete the meal.
<P align=justify>
Sweetie will love this, she thought. 
<P align=justify>
Tiramitsu or chocolate mousse?  Homemade apple pie was his favorite, and 
although it didn't match the rest of the menu, she opted for it anyway.  It's 
all for Sweetie.  Exotic cheese and crackers adorned by red grapes provided a 
simple and succulent appetizer.  Her wine selection was simple: a fine French 
Chardonnay for him and Italian Merlot for her.  It was always the same each 
time they dined. 
<P align=justify>
She picked up a fresh bouquet of exotic flowers to put in her basket.  She 
loved tropical flowers - the more wild and colorful, the better.  Sweetie 
will bring me delicate pink roses, beautifully wrapped in a clear bow-tied 
box, as he always does.  She took a deep breath in anticipation of what the 
evening would be like, much more than a celebration of food, wine and roses. 
Tonight she would have him all to herself. And that was enough! 
<P align=justify>
It was already one o'clock and Sweetie was coming over at seven.  He was 
under the mistaken impression they were going out to dinner and a film 
tonight, as they always did.  He would be pleasantly surprised by her 
efforts.  "What you lack in the kitchen, you make up for ten-fold in the 
bedroom, my love," he'd softly whispered in her ear one recent evening. 
<P align=justify>
Finally, everything was in progress in the kitchen.  The bedroom beckoned.  
Even though they were eating at home, she wanted to look her best.  He liked 
her in black, so she chose a simple elegant dress with a tastefully low cut 
neckline and long beaded sleeves.  It was straight and came down to just 
above her knees, but if she raised her hands far enough in the air, it would 
reveal just enough of her sheer silk stockings to tantalize him when the time 
was ripe. 
<P align=justify>
As the sun set lazily in the sky, she'd realized how much of the day was 
already gone.   Thanks goodness for the mild southern weather that made it 
possible for them to dine outdoors.  She had set up a cozy table for two in 
the back yard, covered with an elegant white tablecloth.  It went so well 
with her bone china and she topped it off with two long, tapered candles 
sheathed by crystal candlesticks.  As she brought out the bouquet of wild 
flowers, she noticed that the moon would be full tonight, shining directly on 
the table. 
<P align=justify>
She poured herself a glass of wine and drew a hot bath with the lavender 
scented bubble bath that Sweetie had given her as a gift.  She bathed in the 
dark, dim glow of six candles placed strategically around the bathroom.  The 
first time Sweetie had ever made love to her was in a bathtub surrounded by 
candles.  She slid into the warm water, feeling the tension of the day's 
activities gently ease out of her body.  Cooking was rough work, she thought, 
remembering all those years her mother would complain about toiling in the 
kitchen. This time was special.
<P align=justify>
She lay tranquil in the warm soapy water, shutting her eyes and imagining how 
the evening might unfold. 
<BR>
<CENTER><HR></CENTER>
<BR><P align=justify>
Sweetie rang the doorbell.  He always arrived between five and ten minutes 
late.  Not too early to interrupt her preparations, but not too tardy to make 
her anxious. He gasped at the sight.  How exquisite she looked this evening!  
He also was dashing in a stylish jacket, shoulders adorned by golden locks 
with bright eyes shining.  As always, he held a bouquet of beautifully 
wrapped pink long-stemmed roses.  He was smiling as if he'd just won the 
lottery. 
<P align=justify>
"Thank you, Sweetie," she said flirtatiously as she took the flowers.  "You 
shouldn't have, but I am glad you did." 
<P align=justify>
She served the wine and cheese while they sat in front of an unlit fireplace 
with a dozen assorted candles.  Sweetie leaned over and kissed her fragrant 
hair.  He could see the reflection of flames in her eyes, although the only 
fire was deep inside her soul. 
<P align=justify>
They sipped their wine, sitting close to one another on the elegant couch.  
She picked up a large grape that seemed to be bursting out of its skin with 
the reddish hue of her lips and licked it.  She placed it gently between his 
teeth.  Then he took another grape and popped it in his mouth ever so 
lightly.  As he bent over to kiss her, he opened his mouth slightly and let 
the grape slide slowly into her parted lips
<P align=justify>
He asked if she was ready for dinner and she shrugged her shoulders 
indifferently. 
<P align=justify>
"Sweetie, I need to go powder my nose.  There is a large plant in the 
backyard I would like moved inside, would you mind?" 
<P align=justify>
"A plant, now?  Can it wait until after we get home from dinner?" 
<P align=justify>
"Sweetie, please?"  She batted her large, soft puppy-dog eyes whose pleadings 
he could never refuse. 
<P align=justify>
"Okay."  He grabbed and kissed her.  "I love you.  Happy Valentine's Day." 
<P align=justify>
She smiled and said nothing. 
<P align=justify>
Sweetie went outside into the backyard.  Suddenly he came back into the house 
with a wide grin. 
<P align=justify>
"This is unbelievable.  Oh, it's incredible.  Did I tell you that I love you 
yet?" 
<P align=justify>
Minutes later, dinner was served under the full moon, star-filled skies and 
infinite heavens.  They didn't eat much, because neither of them was 
particularly anxious for food. When she brought out the sweet smelling apple 
pie, he had tears in his eyes.
<P align=justify>
"How did you do it?" he asked. 
<P align=justify>
"Well, I followed the instructions in the cookbook.  The edges are a little 
burnt, and I hope the apples aren't too crunchy," she laughed. 
<P align=justify>
"Hun," he said, "If this thing were black and on fire, I would eat it whole 
because it came from your hands." 
<P align=justify>
"Let's skip dessert," he whispered.  "Would you like to dance?"  They 
alighted to Chopin's Nocturnes, holding each other tightly, barely swaying, 
with nature surrounding them like a blanket of romantic bliss. 
<P align=justify>
Sweetie kissed her slowly and looked deep inside her deep, dark eyes.  He 
spoke words that he had never spoken before, words that took her breath away, 
phrases that were carved into her heart, and imprinted on her soul. 
<P align=justify>
"Thank you. I will never forget tonight.  Most of all, I want you to know 
some things. I have never met anyone else like you. 
<P align=justify>
"You are so special to me.  You have never played games with me and for that 
I am grateful.  You opened up your heart to me and unconditionally loved me 
without regret.  I will never forget what you have given me." 
<P align=justify>
"I have learned so much from you, but most of all, I have learned howto love. 
You are all love, and to meet someone with such a capacity to give love as 
you do is a rare gift.  I am lucky that I was given this opportunity once in 
my lifetime. In my heart, there will always be a special place for you.  
Always remember that." 
<P align=justify>
They made passionate love under the Magnolia tree while a cool southern 
winter breeze blew through their hair.  Her nails dug into his back like a 
famished tiger desperately, yet lovingly grasping its kill to devour it in 
one bite.  She felt the warm touch of his skin melt into hers, and she 
absorbed his love like a thirsty sponge sucking every ounce of desire out of 
him as though it were his last breath of life. 
<BR>
<CENTER><HR></CENTER>
<BR><P align=justify>
She sat straight up in the tub and opened her eyes. Sweetie would be here in 
thirty minutes and she was running late! 
<P align=justify>
She hurriedly dried off her body and her hair, and then slowly rubbed rose 
scented body lotion all over her legs and arms so she would smell faintly of 
the flowers he would bear at the door. 
<P align=justify>
The bread was warming in the oven as she threw on her dress and carefully 
pulled a silk stocking over each leg, slowly enjoying the smooth feel of the 
fabric as it enveloped the rich fullness of her thighs.  She rummaged 
frantically for her pumps in the back of the closet, knowing that the time 
was near.  A simple pearl necklace would go well with the black dress. She 
adorned her long curly lashes with lush black mascara and filled in her plump 
lips with a deep garnet color.  Finally she pinned her long tresses loosely 
on top of her hair, allowing for a few errant tendrils to spill over her face 
and down the nape of her neck, where his kisses would soon disturb them. 
<P align=justify>
It was seven o'clock. Sweetie was on his way.  Any minute, she would see the 
familiar car lights turn into her driveway.  One last quick check, and 
everything was perfect.  She poured a glass of red wine for herself and a 
white for him before going outside. Once both glasses were on table, it was 
time to light the candles.  The setting appeared to be surrounded by an aura 
of hazy light that she'd seen before only in her dreams.
<P align=justify>
She sat in the chair delicately holding the glass of wine as rich, red, and 
full-bodied as the lips he had so often kissed in her mind. 
<P align=justify>
She toasted the glass of white that sat in front of the empty chair.
<P align=justify>
 Sweetie's chair. 
<P align=justify>
In the darkness, she could almost faintly see his slender silhouette. Minutes 
ticked away as she stared silently into the empty space hoping she could get 
a glimpse<BR>
. . . hoping she would hear his voice . . . hoping he would magically . . . <BR>
hoping . . . <BR>

<P align=justify>Finally she held her glass up in the air. 

<P align=justify>"Happy Valentine's Day, my love." 

<P align=justify>She sipped slowly, sitting alone until the moon set and the sun rose on the 
table. 

<P align=justify>She didn't mind.  It was all for Sweetie.
