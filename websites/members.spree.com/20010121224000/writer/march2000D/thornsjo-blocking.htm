I parked with the house in my rearview mirror. It was a grey and white
Colonial like one I’d imagined in a story several years before, a huge
silent thing with a well-kept yard, a brass nameplate beside the door
and windows with flowered curtains that were just heavy enough to keep
me from seeing inside. “Drive on down the block,” Sylvie had said.
“Don’t wait here.” Then she went alone up the stone walkway and knocked
on the door. She had been inside for almost an hour; how long did it
take? When would it be time for me to start worrying?

<P align=justify>“Watch her,” Jones said. “All right? She comes down here to the rail,
stands looking out over the ocean. Don’t take your eyes off her.”  She’d
been talking to the Templetons, guiding Sylvie (who was standing in for
Jones herself) through a complicated floor pattern of masking tape
intended to represent the nonexistent set; but now as I waited alone in
the truck, I thought that she must have known, must somehow have meant
something more.
<P align=justify>
They had spent the better part of the morning working together up there
under the ungelled light, blocking out act one of the new play. It was
not a rehearsal for character or plot; my dialogue was tossed off in a
casual manner where it was spoken at all. Ranging from the front row to
the back of the house to the stage itself, Jones moved them about like
figures on a board, searching for the right combination of action and
inaction, the certain balance that would move the story along, increase
its dramatic impact and also please the eye. By ten fifteen Sylvie had
disappeared (now when Jones needed someone to fill her shoes it was Mary
up there, taking the calls, shifting a little this way or that), and I
was far in the back of the house, sniffing the air, calling out numbers
to Lon in the booth above. We’d been getting a distinctly smoky smell
from the lights all morning; Lon said that my nose would stand a better
chance than his of tracking it down.
<P align=justify>
“Not that,” I said. “Try number twelve.” Lon squinted at me through the
glass, then turned down to the board. Overhead another row of lights
winked out.
<P align=justify>
That was when Sylvie came back onstage, dressed for the cold in a green
coat that came down to her ankles, an outdated cap and a knotted paisley
scarf. At first I thought she was playing a scene, a whimsey of hers,
the small frightened figure peeking around the curtainedge like a child
that had just found its way in out of a snowstorm. It was a thing she
did sometimes, sudden flights into fantasy, into other unnamed, unknown
characters, when the process of blocking had finally and completely
bored her and she could no longer stay inside the lines of tape.
Sometimes I wondered why Jones allowed it, how Sylvie could get away
with so disrupting a rehearsal. But whenever I asked, Jones would only
say that it was just something we had to put up with. “No one else
complains,” she’d say. “Why should it bother you?”
<P align=justify>
Sylvie came lightfooted across the stage and whispered in Jones’s ear.
She had a purse gripped tight in her fingers; while Mary and the
Templetons stood patiently by, she took out something that looked like a
business card and slipped it into Jones’s hand.
<P align=justify>
“Well?” Lon said. “Is that it?” Jones wrote something down. She handed
back the card, gave Sylvie’s arm a squeeze, and I sniffed the air.
“Yes,” I said. “Yes, I think that’s the one.”
<P align=justify>
Up there in the booth Lon looked like the pilot of a rocketship. He
reached across a soft field of colored light, pulled down a battered old
cardboard box and began to rummage through the jumble of fuses and
switches and wire. I told him I’d fetch the ladder, but he shook his
head no, then gave that faint nod I’d seen often enough before, the one
that meant  <I>Don’t look now</I>…
<P align=justify>
When I turned, Sylvie was standing in the aisle right behind me. Her
hands were gloved and folded; yellow hair curled under the edges of the
cap. She gave me a bright, unforced smile, and said, “Will you drive
me?”
<P align=justify>
“What?” I said. Her eyes were pale blue. She was using them on me again,
and I couldn’t understand why. Not for a ride…
<P align=justify>
“It’s a dentist appointment,” Sylvie said. “Jones said we could take one
of the trucks if you or Lon drove.”
<P align=justify>
I looked up one last time. Lon was pretending not to hear; he had turned
his back to the window. “All right,” I said. “Let’s go.”
<P align=justify>
It was a clear freezing day with the sun coming in a slanted line along
the alley wall. The two trucks were standing end to end, rustcolored and
empty as derelict tanks, in their places far back from the street. As we
came down from the stage door the broken ground crunched under our feet.
Sylvie unlocked her side and tossed the keys to me, and I pulled away
the blocks that Lon kept around the wheels, just like an airplane in a
hangar.
<P align=justify>
Inside, the trucks were bare and green and cold. I had never driven
either of them before; the seats were adjusted to accommodate Lon, and
at first I couldn’t fit my long legs into the cramped space under the
wheel. The seat didn’t want to move, the door didn’t want to close; the
gearshift was a thin, yard-long rod with a bend in it and a knob on top
with the numbers worn completely away. Sylvie sat shivering beside me.
“Choke,” she said as I was about to turn the key. She pointed to a place
under the dashboard, and when I still couldn’t find it she reached over
and gave it a good hard tug. Then the truck coughed and roared; I
watched in the mirror as the alley began to fill with blue smoke.
<P align=justify>
“It must be an important dentist appointment,” I said. I pushed it into
what I hoped was first and began to edge out toward the street. “If it
were me she’d say take the bus. She’d say, do it on your own time.” At
the end of the alley the world came alive. I poked our nose out so I
could see all the way down the avenue. “A company truck and two of us on
rehearsal time. Your mouth must be all rotten. Right or left?”
<P align=justify>
“Left,” Sylvie said, and added, “Rotten is right.” She showed me her
perfectly even rows of teeth. “See? I may need falsies. Seems I’ve got
something that has to come out…”
<P align=justify>
It was a long drive across the bright, heavycoated town. She guided me
straight out toward the suburbs, but would not give me the address. We
had been gone for maybe fifteen minutes when Sylvie drew her purse up
close against her belly and unsnapped the clasp.
<P align=justify>
Inside was the book that Jones had given her, the tattered album filled
with tattered photographs of tattered people, spectral families she had
never known, in whose faces Sylvie seemed to find inspiration. It was
not that she studied them, or used them as models: Sylvie was not that
conscientious an actress, and in any case the ingenue parts that she
played for us bore no resemblance to the people in the book. It appeared
most often in the nervous moments before a show, or when she had lines
that needed to be memorized quickly, or when she’d had an argument with
Jones or Moscow, and could not get her own way. Now, as we left the last
cluster of warehouses behind us, Sylvie drew the book out of her purse.
She held it tight, unopened like a bible, in her gloved fingers.
<BR><BR><HR><BR><BR>
<P align=justify>
The sign in the shadow of a leafless maple said MD. With the truck
paused at the gate and Sylvie climbing down to the street, I’d made a
point of looking at that strip of brass: MD in curled letters cut deep
into the metal, not DDS. For half a moment Sylvie stood unmoving in the
street with her hand on the doorframe. She looked up at me from under
the edge of her cap. “I’ll probably be a while,” she said.
<P align=justify>
I nodded. “Will you be all right?” I said in the rumble of the engine.
“Is it -- do you need help?”
<P align=justify>
Sylvie pushed hard on the door until it clicked, stood with her face
framed in the window. She gave me her best ingenue smile. “You can, if
you want,” she said. “You can hold my head…”
<P align=justify>
She had waved with the hand that held the book. She had turned her back.
Drive on, she had said. Don’t wait here. Now I sat alone in the truck
with my shoulders hunched against the cold and my knees pressed
together, and hated her for the whole affair; for the necessity of it,
and for dragging me into its midst. In the cracked glass of the rearview
mirror a patrol car came slowly down through the neighborhood. They
passed me at a crawl, the blue-suited men inside turning their faces up
to mine. They had long, cleanshaven jaws and eyes like broken glass set
well back under their brows. They looked up at me as if they knew it
all, as if they thought I was the one responsible.
<BR><BR><HR><BR><BR>
<P align=justify>

Shortly after one there was a fluttering behind the iron gate. She
appeared at last at the bottom of the yard, standing with her feet in
the leaves and the edges of her coat stirring against the cold air. From
a distance she was unchanged. She waved as I fired up the engine; I
backed into someone’s driveway, spun the wheel around, and Sylvie waited
on the white sidewalk. She lifted her eyes as I brought the truck
looming over her. She was trying not to look wistful, and failing.
<P align=justify>
I was so foolish; I knew so little. I half expected to see blood running
down her ankles. At the very least, I thought, the color will have
drained from her face. But in the afternoon light she looked fresh and
just a little bit pale; she even laughed when I raced around the front,
around the warming grille, and offered to help her up. “Star treatment,”
she said. “I like that.” She pulled herself up over the running board,
into the cracked seat, her hand sliding down over my forearm until the
tips of her fingers rested lightly in the palm of my hand. “Well now,
Jeeves,” she said. She looked down at me, bit her lip and took hold of
my index finger. “‘D’you think we could stop somewhere on the way back?
D’you think you’re up to buying a girl a strawberry frappe?”
<P align=justify>
I would have agreed to anything to get out of that neighborhood. The
houses all seemed to have black glass in the windows; apart from the
police car nothing had stirred but the leaves beyond the silent yards.
It reminded me of home.
<P align=justify>
We found a white-fronted pharmacy on the edge of the city that had a
soda fountain in back, past rows of patent medicines and cheap celluloid
toys hanging from hooks above the dusty shelves. In a corner by the
restrooms was a poorly installed booth that we took even though the
counter seats were empty. They had strawberry ice cream, so Sylvie was
happy. I’d been hungry when we left the theater; now I only ordered a
cola.
<P align=justify>
“You’re kind of quiet,” Sylvie said when our glasses came.
<P align=justify>
“I think doctors are the most frightening things going,” I said. I
hadn’t really thought about it before, and wasn’t sure if I meant it,
but I had to say something. “Was it very frightening?”
<P align=justify>
Sylvie licked around the edge of the froth, swirled thick reddish ice
cream around her spoon, tasted it and made a face. “Nothing compared to
forgetting your lines,” she said. At first I thought she was trying to
keep up the charade, the non-existent dentist appointment that kept
things nice and did not fool anyone. But there was none of her usual
coyness in the way she said it, nothing of the happy distraction that
signalled one of her fantasies, her wanderings. She sat with her fingers
curled around the ice cream shaped glass, her eyes sometimes averted,
sometimes not, and talked to me as if she was not even an actress, as if
I was not even male.
<P align=justify>
“You’ve never been in a position to have it happen to you,” she said,
“so you couldn’t know. It’s the worst when you’ve done something a
hundred times, so you think you’re safe and you don’t worry about it.
Then you get up under that light, in front of hundreds of people and you
don’t remember what to say, you don’t remember how to move or what to do
or where to go, only you know it’s your line next and you’re supposed to
do something. That’s the worst. That’s when I just bat my eyes. There’s
always someone out there who knows how to whistle.”
<P align=justify>
There was too much ice in my drink. “So you get prompted,” I said. “It’s
no big deal. It happens to everyone sooner or later.”
<P align=justify>
“It doesn’t happen to Jones,” Sylvie said. “Anyway, it’s how you feel
before the prompt comes that counts.”
<P align=justify>
She had spooned out about a third of the frappe when something dark
passed over her face. “Maybe this wasn’t such a hot idea after all,” she
said, looking down into the open mouth of the glass. She dropped the
spoon clattering into her empty plate, pushed the frappe away in a long
wet line across the table and fumbled in the seat with her hat and
purse. Her hands and cheeks had turned white; I thought she was going to
vomit all over the booth. “Can you take me home, please?” she said. “I
don’t feel very good…”
<BR><BR><HR><BR><BR><P align=justify>

Sylvie lived in one room on the fourth floor of a decaying old
brownstone house not more than ten minutes walk from the theater. Beyond
her narrow door the walls were so covered with theater programs,
discarded costume sketches, magazine covers, circus posters and
fragments of antique dresses that the room seemed to be made entirely of
paper and cloth. In the dusty light from a single iron-bracketed window
the roof made one-half of an inverted V over a childsized bed covered
neatly with a black and red patchwork quilt. It was maybe three steps
from the door to the bed; between them was a wooden hatstand with a dark
robe on it and a man’s pajama bottoms.
<P align=justify>
Sylvie looked half asleep when I sat her on the bed. I took off her cap
and hung it with her purse on the hatstand, then unbuttoned her coat.
She let me pull her arms through the sleeves, but she thought it made a
pretty good blanket, and wouldn’t let go.
<P align=justify>
She seemed better now, her color had returned, yet she was acting as
though she had been drugged. I unlaced her shoes, and Sylvie hummed
softly to herself with her head lolling backward at a strange angle, her
hair against the curling edge of an unframed watercolor. I recognized
Mary’s hand in the brushstrokes; it was a swirl of maroon and purple
tacked into the descending slope of the roof, a costume plan of Sylvie
as a dancing Cossack.
<P align=justify>
“Stop pretending,” I said. I pulled her feet out from under her, and she
sank back flat onto the little bed. There was an aged, satiny pillow
that crinkled as she rested her head upon it. Sylvie gave a sigh as if
she were just waking from a trance, and opened her eyes. She looked like
she’d never seen the room before, but decided soon enough that she liked
it. Her breath came in long, relaxed whispers. “Thanks,” she said, quiet
almost beyond the level of hearing. “Moscow would never have helped me.
He’s an old poop.”
<P align=justify>
I didn’t like the way she was smiling. She ran her fingers along the
wall of silk and textured paper, turned her head on the pillow and
looked up at me from under her lashes. Something was tugging on my
collar. It shunted my tie all out of place, drew me down until I could
feel her breath against my cheek. The bed creaked under her. Our noses
almost touched. She lifted her jaw, and still could not reach my lips.
“Why are you fighting me?” she said without opening her eyes. Then her
fingers came up around the base of my neck, and her tongue found its way
into my mouth. She let out a sigh that seemed to completely deflate her
beneath me. She tasted of strawberry ice cream.
<P align=justify>
I wanted to touch her and I wanted not to touch her. I wanted both of
them a lot. I kept my hands straight at my sides. I tried not to
breathe. There was a laugh and something else in her eyes when she
finally let me go. I lost my balance in getting away from her, from the
bed. I nearly fell over. “She doesn’t love you,” Sylvie said. “Not the
way you want. She never will.”
<P align=justify>
I looked around for my hat, realized that I hadn’t been wearing one, and
Sylvie remained with her head on the pillow and giggled. “I know,” I
said. I went out into the rank stairwell, into the cold air; I tried not
to slam the door behind. I could see my breath.
<BR><BR><HR><BR><BR>
<P align=justify>

The sun had already passed over when I came backing down the alley. I
had to turn the lights on to keep from bumping into the truck behind.
Jones was standing nearly invisible in the shadow of the stage door.
“Well?” she said as I climbed down from the seat. “How did it go?”
<P align=justify>
It was so cold out now that I could not keep from shivering. Jones was
only wearing a light workshirt; how could she stand it? “She wasn’t
feeling all that well,” I said. “I don’t think she’ll be coming in
tonight.”
<P align=justify>
Jones shrugged. “I told her not to bother.” She took the blocks from
where I’d piled them, handed me a pair, and together we fitted them
around the dirty wheels.
<P align=justify>
“Do you know what she was having done?” I said when we came into the
bright, warm rooms in back. I could hear Mary singing somewhere close
by; out on the stage, Templeton was practicing his lines.
<P align=justify>
“How do you think she got the address?” Jones said. “I couldn’t have her
going to the neighborhood butcher.” She turned to me and smiled. She
didn’t seem to mean anything by it. “You saw her to bed?”
<P align=justify>
“Yes,” I said.
<P align=justify>
“Good. Now I need you onstage. We’re blocking out act two; you’ll have
to take Sylvie’s place for now.”
