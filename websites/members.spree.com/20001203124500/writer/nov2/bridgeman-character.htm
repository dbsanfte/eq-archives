<BR><P align=justify>

The difference between an interesting story and a dull story is simple - characters.  Readers have to be interested in the characters.  Developing your characters is what breathes life into your story and makes it intriguing, attractive, and thought provoking.

<BR><P align=justify>Read for each character with respect to action, environment, and plot.  Develop the character.  Attempt to address each character on one or all of the following three levels at all times.<BR><BR>
 a.   Physical/perceptive<BR>
 b.   Spiritual/Emotional<BR>
 c.   Intellectual <BR>
<BR><P align=justify>
I have a theory that people, and therefore Characters, are basically Triangles.   Above the desk where I write is a picture of two triangles joined by a rainbow (You may know it as the album cover from Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon") to remind me of that principle. 
<BR><P align=justify>On the one side, we have all things physical, which encompasses all of our physical needs and physical sensations.  Physicality encompasses all five senses.  It also includes our instinctive needs and those things we require in order to survive, namely; hunger, thirst, and our need for air.  
<BR><P align=justify>On another side of the triangle, we have things dealing with intellect.  Our thoughts, certainly, but also our reasoning.  Memories, fantasies, puzzles, dilemmas, impressions, all of these things have to do with the intellect.  At any given moment are we perceptive or intuitive?  Are we learning or teaching, observing or accomplishing?
<BR><P align=justify>
At our base, or foundation, of our triangle are things dealing with spirituality and emotion.  Spirituality is essentially "Faith," or the belief (or lack thereof) in the unproveable.  Faith can be not only belief in a divine hand taking part in our lives, but actually recognizing that hand when it is there.  Spirituality can also be the complete denial of Faith.  Paradoxically, denial of Faith is a form of Faith.
<BR><P align=justify>As a side note, I believe that Faith - this single element of character development - is the most commonly omitted element of characters in modern writing.  I also believe it may be what separates a good story from a best seller or a one time run from an enduring classic.
<BR><P align=justify>Emotion is our unconscious reaction to everything.  Granted, emotion has it's roots in intellect, but emotions such as fear, anger, frustration, hatred, sadness, grief, joy, elation, jubilation, love, happiness, peace, contentment, all occur involuntarily and demand description.
<BR><CENTER><HR></CENTER><BR><P align=justify>
As the writer, we have two jobs when dealing with our characters.  First, it is up to us to decide whether they are an equilateral triangle or not.  Some characters can be very spiritual and at the same time very evil which can be extremely frightening.  Stephen King has made millions based on this principle alone.  Other characters can appear superhuman if they have different physical needs.  A character who can go six hours without breathing, or months without sleep or food, for example, would be seen as more than human.  Any of the Conan stories demonstrate similar principles.  A character who seems never to devote thought to their actions or perceive the circumstances of events as they occur would seem quite foolish, or lucky, or both.  Does anyone remember A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy?
<BR><CENTER><HR></CENTER><BR><P align=justify>
Secondly, it is up to us to fill in the triangle with action, events, or circumstances -- describing how all this affects the character on every side -- thus making a three dimensional and fully realized character.  
<BR><P align=justify>This is where the writer kisses the mound of clay and brings life to the work.  Let us look at how we can develop a character.
<BR><P align=justify>
<FONT color="#B000B0">Jane hung up the telephone.  She got up from the couch and walked into the kitchen.  She thought about the conversation she just had with her lover.  She poured a glass of water and drank it.  She looked outside and smoked a cigarette.  She walked outside onto the deck where she stared at the moon and cried.</FONT>
<BR><P align=justify>Now, obviously, there is not a great deal of description here.  Nevertheless, compare the above to the following revision:


<FONT color="#B000B0"><BR><P align=justify>Jane listened to the silence on the line as her shaking palm pressed the telephone uncomfortably against her ear.  She took a few deep breaths as she fumbled the handset noisily back into the cradle.  She felt a familiar empty ache in her middle begging to be filled with something but her mind and her heart felt numb.
<BR><P align=justify>She slammed her eyes shut and shook her head violently to clear out the tangled cobwebs of the remembered conversation.  With a deep breath, she  got up from the couch and strolled barefoot from the carpeted den to the cold tile floor of the kitchen.  The bottoms of her feet were nearly black as she had not bathed in three days.
<BR><P align=justify>She felt hungry but she knew she could not eat.  She opened the cabinet above the cutting board and it creaked on its hinges as always.  The noise never failed to unnerve Jane.  She retrieved a glass and slammed the cabinet shut.
<BR><P align=justify>As Jane turned, she caught a glimpse of her reflection in the window above the sink.  Her hair had not been brushed since early this morning.  She wore the same tattered bathrobe she had worn since he had left three days ago.  Her eyes look tiny as they peeked out around the puffy bags to either side of her skin.
<BR><P align=justify> "I used to be beautiful," she murmured as moved the dirty dishes aside, making room to fill her glass.  She flipped on the water and filled it to the rim.  She had to turn the faucet very hard to the left so that it would not drip.
<BR><P align=justify>The water felt very cold against her lips and tongue.  It tasted metallic and slightly bitter.  She took three huge gulps, finishing half of the glass, and felt the water slither down into her stomach, grabbing her insides, knotting them up like a viscous claw.
<BR><P align=justify>His voice still echoed in the corners of her mind.  "I'm not coming home next week."  His baritone voice, deep, masculine, ponderous, methodical, refused to abandon her private thoughts.  "We really need to talk.  Things have gotten out of hand.  It isn't working out."
<BR><P align=justify>Jane stared out into the night, moving the dingy curtains aside in search of the moon or some stars.  When had her life gotten so complicated?  She slammed the glass down onto the crowded counter, pulled her bathrobe a bit tighter around her middle, and dug into the big side pocket for her crumpled pack of cigarettes.  She retrieved a smoke and her disposable lighter as she padded out of the kitchen and walked out onto the deck.  As the door slowly swung closed, she lit the cigarette, filling her lungs with a huge puff.
<BR><P align=justify>Moonlight shone down on her and she turned to stare at the crescent shape as it danced behind dark clouds.  The lake lapped quietly against the shore and tiny creatures stirred in the night here and there, running their nocturnal errands.
<BR><P align=justify>"I see the moon and the moon sees me," she sang as she exhaled a cloud of smoke into the moist night air through her mouth and nose.  "The moon sees somebody I'd like to see.  God bless the moon and God bless me.  God bless somebody I'd like to see."
<BR><P align=justify>Jane dropped her cigarette onto the dew covered planks of the deck, grabbed the rail for support, and let gigantic sobs take her.  
</FONT>
<BR><P align=justify>Now the reader has a sense of physicality, thoughts, emotions, and spirituality of the character.  In other words, the story is no longer dry, lifeless, and boring.  It does not read like a documentary.  Also, the reader is obliged to identify with the character and for the first time feels that they are personally involved in the events and their outcome.
<BR><P align=justify>This is because every sentence in the revision emphasizes something about the character either physically, emotionally, or spiritually.  We have a glimpse of her personality, her habits, her tidiness.  We have a glimpse into her private thoughts but the scene still builds suspense because no questions are truly answered directly.

<BR><P align=justify>Try this technique with your characters.  Try to emphasize at least one aspect of their personality with each sentence that involves them.  I think you will see that your characters will come alive more than ever before.
