                 about unreliable people on an unreliable computer. A dog, in many of her recent stories, plays a
                 significant role, like Piper in THE AGE OF TALK She has published more than three dozen of these
                 stories, eight or nine with a dog for a leading character, and hopes to collect a group of dog stories into

 started writing poetry at the age of 13 and found it to be a safe way to release
a lot of emotions, as well as being as necessary as breathing. I am a proud
mother of 4, Stepmother of 2 great step kids, Grandmother of 3 and married to
my soul mate all at the young yet full age of 33. A Writer's Choice is the first to
honor me by placing one of my poems and hopefully more in the future. I also
                                  have an up coming spot in <U>Critique magazine</U> for their fall issue. Thanks for
                                  sharing a moment with me.</FONT>

                 at Murdoch University. I love sport and do a lot of cycling, swimming and play squash. In March 2000 I
                 head back to Pretoria, South Africa where I will start my first 'real' job. I have written poems episodically
