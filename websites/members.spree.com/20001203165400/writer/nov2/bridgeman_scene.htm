<P align=justify>
One of the more challenging thing for any writer is setting the scene.  In today's literature, there is a huge emphasis on character driven stories.  That is as it should be, but the thing that has apparently been overlooked is that the scene is often a character in its own right.
<BR><P align=justify>Remember high school Shakespeare?  Back then, most of us probably had no idea that we would end up writing for a living.  If we had an inkling, we paid attention.  Shakespeare always let the scene tell at least part of the story.  For example, throughout the play MacBeth, it is overcast or stormy.  This reflects the political intrigue and series of assassinations taking place inside the castle walls.
<BR><P align=justify>If we can apply letting a scene move the reader and set the tone in today's work, it can often have a profound effect on the reader.  There are essentially two ways to do this.  The first is by, like Shakespeare, letting the scene mimic the mood and thoughts of the characters and the action.  The second is by placing it in stark juxtaposition, such that the scene becomes a foil, an obvious contrast to the characters.
<BR><P align=justify>In the following scene, our heroine, Angela, leaves work early after she receives a telephone call.  The police call to tell her that her twelve-year-old son has just been found dead near his school.
<BR><P align=justify>
Angela felt hysteria clawing its way up from her middle, scratching and tearing its way up to her mind where it would take over.  She beat it down soundly as she slammed the telephone back into the cradle.  Inside her lungs, hysteria squeezed, trying to force out a scream.  Angela clamped her jaw shut tight.
<BR><P align=justify>She snatched up her purse and dashed to her bosses office.  She spotted him through the glass partition.  Mr. Garrison Reynolds was talking on the telephone.  He was smiling, nodding his head, chuckling.  She walked right up to his desk without knocking.
<BR><P align=justify>"I'm leaving.  My son's been killed.."  Her voice sounded incredibly calm, like a stranger's.
<BR><P align=justify>Garrison held up one finger, asking his client to hold.  He turned his steel gray eyes her way and asked, "What did you say?"
<BR><P align=justify>"My son's been killed.  Ricky.  The police just called me."
<BR><P align=justify>After a few seconds, he asked, "You're joking right?  Is this about the Reader Foreclosure?"
<BR><P align=justify>"Screw you, Garrison.  I quit."  She dashed out of his office and headed for the elevators.

<BR><P align=justify>We get a feel for Angela's emotions but a scene with this kind of impact could be made even more powerful if the setting took a hand.  In the following revision, the office will reflect Angela's mood.

<BR><P align=justify>Angela felt hysteria clawing its way up from her middle, scratching and tearing its way up to her mind where it would take over.  She beat it down soundly as she turned to look out the windows along the near wall.  The sky looked very dark gray, nearly black, ominous with an impending storm.  What had Ricky been doing outside?  He could have caught cold.  He had not taken his raincoat to school.
<BR><P align=justify>She spotted a bolt of lightning in the distance and slammed the telephone back into the cradle.  The telephone never brought her good news.  This same little black telephone with its blinking red lights and four incoming lines had informed her of countless accounts she had lost in the last three years.  It had ushered in the last hours of her marriage when her sister, June, finally called after weeks of waffling to inform Angela of the truth.  June knew for a fact that her only brother-in-law, Angela's husband, was having an affair with his secretary.  <BR><P align=justify>This telephone played a major role in settling the affairs related to her divorce for over a year after that.  
<BR><P align=justify>She thought of this telephone as a little black monster with blinking red eyes and very sharp teeth.  Just then, the little monster began to squeal with its electronic chirp, demanding attention, mercilessly waiting to dish out yet more ill tidings.  No way would she let it sink its teeth back in today, not now.  Ring on, she thought, ring to your heart's content.
<BR><P align=justify>Inside her lungs, hysteria squeezed, trying to force out a scream.  Angela clamped her jaw shut tight.  All around her, clerks dashed back and forth carrying armloads of forms and paperwork.  Marian Greames had called the Helpdesk for the third time this week because her computer would not stop locking up.  Marian stood outside her cubicle scowling at the technician.  She looked so upset, like losing a file here or there was a major catastrophe.  Angela wondered what would happen if she did scream.  Would they even look up from their desk?
<BR><P align=justify>She snatched her purse up from the back of the worn chair and the strap snagged on the ergonomically designed armrest.  These chairs had been designed in Switzerland to perfectly fit the human form.  Angela had decided that the humans in Switzerland must strongly resemble double-jointed ostriches.  She pulled her purse free and the chair flew across her cubicle, squealing on its plastic rollers before crashing into her wisteria.  The plant fell over and spilled potting soil in a huge wedge, covering her toes.
<BR><P align=justify>Angela kicked the dirt off her shoes and dashed past the line of cubicles to her supervisor, Garrison Reynolds', office.  A clerk with an armload of printed spreadsheets stepped out of the second to last cubicle and Angela almost bowled him over.
<BR><P align=justify>"Hey, slow down!  Crazy woman!"
<BR><P align=justify>"Move!"  Angela screamed as she shoved past the kid.
<BR><P align=justify>Angela spotted Garrison through the glass partition.  Mr. Garrison Reynolds was talking on the telephone.  He was smiling, nodding his head, chuckling.  Did he think anything someone could say on the telephone was funny?  She walked right up to his desk without knocking.
<BR><P align=justify>"Well, heck yeah, we will," Garrison said as he pointed to a chair facing his desk.  He did not even bother to look up at her, just kept thumbing through his Daytimer.  "I think I can reserve us a tee for the 16th.  How does 8 AM sound to you?  Good?"
<BR><P align=justify>Angela barely managed to keep herself from screaming a stream of invective.  This jerk was talking about his golf game?  Was he completely ignorant to the fact that people were dying, that children were dying all around him?  She took a deep breath to try to calm herself.  She smelled the strong odor of Garrison's Cuban cigars.  It made her want to gag.
<BR><P align=justify>"I'm leaving.  My son's been killed," she interrupted.  Her voice sounded incredibly calm, like a stranger's.
<BR><P align=justify>Garrison held up one finger, asking his "client," to hold.  His fat, nicotine stained finger jabbed the dirty hold button and he finally turned his steel gray eyes her way.  When the man breathed it sounded like someone wheezing for their last breath, like someone suffering from a permanent asthma attack.  His little black eyes peered out of his pudgy face like those of a viper.  His nostrils flared like a pig.  His clothes were wrinkled and sweat soaked, like his office - wrinkled papers strewn about, sweat soaked furniture, and that sickening cigar smell everywhere.  He asked, "What did you say?"
<BR><P align=justify>"My son's been killed.  Ricky.  The police just called me."
<BR><P align=justify>After a few seconds, he asked, "You're joking right?  Is this about the Reader Foreclosure?"
<BR><P align=justify>"I'm not joking.  I'm leaving."
<BR><P align=justify>Garrison stood up quickly, more quickly than she could have imagined for a man of his bulk.  He hefted himself halfway around the sweaty, untidy desk and said, "Look, Angela, I need you on this conference call at four..."
<BR><P align=justify>"Screw you," Angela explained.  "I quit."
She dashed out of his office and headed for the elevators.

<BR><P align=justify>You can see how the scene peripherally adds to her feelings of confusion, loss, and anger.  The weather outside reflects a brewing storm, similar to the storm inside Angela.  The telephone is portrayed as a thing alive, an evil muse.  The coworker in a tizzy about her computer problems acts as a nice foil to Angela who is dealing with a real problem.  The potting soil that buries her toes draws a rather ominous metaphor for the upcoming burial of her son.  The smell and the things she sees in Garrison's office add a nice touch.  All she wants to do is get out as quickly as possible.
<BR><P align=justify>You can imagine writing this same scene where everything in Angela's environment is perfectly clean, perfectly orderly, and everyone is perfectly happy.  This would play even more strongly against her feelings of near shock in this moment.  
<BR><P align=justify>These are the elements of scene: sight, smell, sound, touch, and taste.  The scene is seen through our characters' eyes and colored by their perceptions.
<BR><P align=justify>Imagine a perfect sky full of stars after a passionate night of lovemaking.  Imagine a graveyard where the wind howls against the monuments like a lost soul.  Imagine our own Angela in the back of the cab with every bump in the road jarring her spine.  Imagine a hospital with its antiseptic smells and its mysterious intercom announcements.  Imagine a kiss where your character tastes the wine that the person they are kissing just sipped.
<BR><P align=justify>Experiment in your own work and I think you will see a marked difference.
