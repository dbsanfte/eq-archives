	<b>
<P>	How many music lovers are we worldwide to ask this question ?
Thousands ?
Millions ? I couldn't say but surely a great lot of people so sorry
to
learn that the music we love is so far behind the « pop » music.</P>

<P>Sure the record industry is sick and, maybe, going to die in a few
years
but the discrepancy between those two kinds of music is so evident
that we
may wonder if the classical music lovers are not nowadays a
separate race.</P>

<P>The most eloquent proof of this is the ranking of classical music
in terms
of record selling. Let's take the example of France which we know
well. The
percentage of classical music CDs sold last year was under 6% and
even less
for jazz. Amazing, isn't it ?</P>

<P>When you read that the best seller was Riccardo Muti's New Year
concert of
January 1st 2000( probably the worst concert of the kind of the
last ten 
years ), that the second position was occupied by the never dying
three 
tenors and that the third best seller was the violinist André Rieu
who is 
to be compared with Menuhin or Vengerov as much as music by the
Rondo 
Veneziano is to be compared with Vivaldi's , your opinion will be
done.</P>

<P>Music has become a matter of money just as sport to quote an
example of
wide public interest. They keep selling quality but they mainly bet
on
rentability. Who can we pretend to be to reproach this kind of
attitude in
a world where the master word is MONEY?</P>

<P>I read a few weeks ago a phrase written or pronounced by Rick
Jones,
critic at the Evening Standard. Those were the exact words :
« Michael Nyman is the greatest living composer in the sense that
Richard
Clayderman  is the greatest living pianist ».</P>

<P>Apart from that hateful money-making spirit which, in my sense, is
detrimental to classical music interests, what makes that so few
people
listen to it ? This subject would need the intervention of a
specialist in
the study of human  brain since people love that music and at the
same time
refuse it as a companion.</P>

<P>Yet,everybody, your neighbour, your grocer, your butcher, your
mecanic, is
a potential classical music lover. You too, reading this article,
who maybe
have never spent a full hour in your life listening to Bach or
Mozart or
Wagner, are an unconscious classical music lover.</P>

<P>It is an admitted fact that we are afraid of the unknown and
classical
music is also a victim of this form of racism which we know exists
in the
field of human relationships.</P>

<P>Suppose you tell a friend to go with you to a classical music
concert.
What would his first reaction be ? He would start smiling thinking
that you
are making fun of him. And yet, that same friend probably shivered
looking
at Tom Hanks in the film « Philadelphia » when the latter, aware
that he
has aids and that he is due to die soon, listens to the air of « La
Mamma
morta » in Giordano's opera « Andrea Chenier" ».</P>
<P>
Do you think this friend remained indifferent when, as Tim Robbins,
alias
Andy Dufresne, locked in a small room, plays a piece of classical
music,
all the prisoners taking their break in the prison yard raise their
heads
to the loud speakers like turned to stone statues.
Why « Farinelli », « Amadeus », «Tous les matins du monde » have
been such
successes ? Thanks to the actors, to the beauty of the costumes, to
the
stories themselves ? Of course not.
What made the worldwide repitation of « Apocalypse now » if not the
air
attack by helicopters with the « Walkyries' ride » as musical
background ?
What do people best remember of « Out of Africa » if not the moment
of the
film during which the second movement of Mozart's clarinet concerto
is
played ?
What would have been  Visconti's« Death in Venice » without
Mahler's fifth
symphony adagietto or his  « Senso » without Bruckner's music ?
Why is classical music always used to accompany masterpieces ?
Wouldn't it be because it is the best music , the music that cannot
die ?</p>

<P>F.Nietzsche wrote in his « Twilight of Idols »,
« Without music, life would be a mistake ».
How many people live daily without even realizing that mistake ?
They may say it is pure demagogy to pretend that it is every music
lover's
duty to help one's friends, relatives, colleages and neighbours to
correct
that mistake. I personally know that it is not since I have been
doing it
for years for the sole satisfaction of bringing others to beauty
and
pleasure.
I wish we were millions to do the same and, as the Beatles would
sing, the
world would be better.
