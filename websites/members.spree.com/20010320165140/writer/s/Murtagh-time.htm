<P>One of the biggest problems facing most people, let alone those working from 
home, is that of time management. I don't mean we waste our time by being 
lazy and doing nothing - if we are honest we all do that sometimes - but how 
many of us, at the end of what seemed like a busy day, have sat down and 
wondered just what we have achieved?</P>

<P>How often have you heard someone say "I've been so busy today, but I don't 
seem to have achieved anything?"</P>

<P>This is the main difference between life's achievers and those who, although 
always busy, never get anywhere. The people who "achieve" are the ones who 
make the most use of their time - the one commodity that we all have in equal 
amounts -, its just that successful people spend their time wisely while most 
people waste their time. It does not matter how intelligent, educated, rich or 
well connected you are, if you don't use your time efficiently, you are sure to 
fail.</P>

<P>I don't mean that you should spend all your time slaving away over your 
computer - far from it! - What I do mean is that you should use your time 
effectively - both work and leisure time.</P>

<P>But I can hear you saying "I spend twelve hours a day working, I just have that 
much to do I never seem to be able to finish or to have time to relax." I would 
say that if you manage your time effectively, you would achieve more in eight 
hours than you are presently doing in twelve.</P>

<P>First, to know how to save time, you need to know (not guess) how you are 
spending your time at present. If you are serious about making yourself more 
effective, please carry out the following task thoroughly - I bet that the results 
will surprise you and shock you into action.</P>

<P>What I want you to do is to keep a Time Log of all your activity for the next 
two weeks. Take a piece of paper, or a diary page, divide each working day into 
quarter of an hour slots, and at the end of each fifteen minutes, make a brief 
note of how you have spent that time.</P>

<P>I would suggest that you formulate a simple key so that you do not waste more 
time writing! This would obviously be something that suits your particular 
work, but it could be something like: - A - time spent reading e-mails; B - time 
spent reading ezines; C- replying to emails; D - making coffee; E - making 
phone calls; F - receiving phone calls; G - being interrupted by 
colleagues/family who just want a chat; H - travelling; I - attending meetings - 
and so on, I am sure you get the picture.</P>

<P>At the end of each day, simply add up the time spent on each activity and 
record it. At the end of the two weeks I am sure you will be amazed at the time 
you spent on actively moving your business forward and how much time was 
wasted, even though it "appeared" as if it was work!</P>

<P>As the days progress you will probably begin to notice things you are doing 
that are unproductive and begin to alter your habits. Do you really need to read 
all those ezines?</P>
<P>
At the end of the fortnight, you should sit down and review your time log. Does 
the amount of time spent on something correlate to the importance of that item 
towards achieving your primary goal - growing a profitable business?
</P>
<P>Could you alter how you do some tasks to help you complete them faster?
</P>
<P>Do you need to subscribe to all those ezines? I certainly found when I was 
beginning in this business I subscribed to every ezine I could - but after a time I 
was becoming inundated with them. So what I did was make a list of them all, 
and as each one arrived I marked its importance to me as either 1 - very useful - 
2 - some useful information and 3 - of no interest whatsoever. After I had 
received three copies of an ezine, I looked at the scores I had given it and if the 
marks were all 3's I unsubscribed immediately; if they were a mixture of 2's 
and 3's I waited to receive a further couple of copies; but if neither of those 
scored a 1, I again unsubscribed. I am now spending about a quarter of the time 
I was previously, but still receiving as much benefit.
Do you have a large number of emails, ezines or favourite pages that you never 
access and don't know what they are? Be ruthless - plan to spend a part of each 
day reading them and either deleting them or putting them into a clearly 
marked folder so that you can find them easily in the future.</P>

<P>Once you are up to date, read each piece of information as you receive it and 
then either act upon it, file it or delete it - don't let your computer, your desk or 
your mind become clogged up with useless trivia. If you are unsure of whether 
to keep something, ask yourself what the worst thing that could happen if you 
never had access to it again? If you cant think of anything - get rid of it!
</P>
<P>Ok, so now you have managed to get rid of the elements that you were wasting 
your time on, but how do you move forward to the next stage of actually 
ensuring that your time is spent productively?</P>

<P>Just as you should have planned the future, you need to plan each day. At the 
end of each day, take five minutes to list the things you need to do the 
following day. Then prioritise each item. Ask yourself - will doing this help me 
achieve my goal? Is this something I can get someone else to do? (delegate) 
How urgent is it?</P>

<P>The following morning, work through each item in order of priority. Where 
possible, do the hardest/most unpleasant task first. Once that is out of the way 
the rest of your day will seem to go quicker and smoother than if you were 
worrying all day about having to do it!</P>

<P>During the day learn to say no to people. Your time is important. Don't let other 
people impose on you and use you to use their time better!</P>
