<P>I get real angry at politicians to the point 
I've started stereotyping them all as 
bureaucrats...with all due respect to hard
working bureaucrats everywhere (is hard-working 
bureaucrat an oxymoron?).</P>

<P>Wow...first paragraph and I've already 
offended a bunch of folks.</P>
<P>
But I want to go on record of being 
dissatisfied with politicians on three 
counts--follow thru' with me on this.</P>

<P>Forget about the Clinton sex scandal, for
heaven sakes...that's minor compared with
the things I'm going to talk about.</P>

<P>During my career I have been acutely aware 
that the American diet is directly related 
to the major cause of death in our society.</P> 

<P>The number-crunchers at the CENTERS FOR DISEASE 
CONTROL AND PREVENTION know this, and it's known 
also by statisticians with epidemiological studies 
such as Framingham and Cornell-China Diet studies. 
Everything points to the fact that over half of 
the population of most developed countries are 
eating themselves into an early grave.
</P>
<P>In the 60s and 70s, Senator George McGovern
headed a Senate Select Committee that looked
at the benefits (and lack of) of the American 
diet. They gathered together all of the research 
data that was available from the 40s, 50s, and 60s. 
McGovern, and the other members of the committee 
(Including Ted Kennedy and Bob Dole), released 
a document that became known as the McGovern report.</P>

<P>So nobody can plead ignorance, because our 
political leaders put it writing way back in 
the 70s. I've got to say it: "Thanks George, 
at least you made the attempt."</P>

<P>But then McGovern and the rest just let it 
drop, and steered clear of the issue pretty 
much from that time on. </P>
<P>
If you've had a bout with a carcinoma
cancer, heart disease, or other circulatory
problems, or have a loved one who has succumbed
to one of these problems (and that covers 
99% of us), you might want to ask our politicians
"why weren't you more aggressive in telling us 
about the dangers of the hi-fat/protein diet?" 
They still aren't telling us the whole truth.</P>

<P>The second thing is the national debt. It grew 
and grew until the danger was so obvious that
the politicians had to say something. Most of the 
rhetoric tended to be the finger-pointing variety,
and promises that "they" are the only ones that can
fix it. Yeah, right!...like the folks that caused 
the problem are going to fix it?...you believe that??</P>
<P>
The economy is better today than it has been in years. 
Who do you think is responsible for that? I hope 
you haven't bought into the claims that it's the
Clinton presidency or the Republican Congress.</P>

<P>If you look at what is causing a great deal of the
healthy cash flow in this country you will see
that a couple of the players are Microsoft and 
R.J. Reynolds-Nabisco.</P>
<P>
Now notice what our leaders are trying to do as we 
speak...they're trying to attach themselves to the 
udder of these two wealthy CashCows...aren't they?</P>

<P>Of course we're told that their only purpose is to
stop children from smoking and to make sure that Bill
Gates isn't building a monopoly...you believe that??</P>

<P>They knew that smoking was killing folks by the 
millions but didn't get too whipped up about it until
they realized these companies had even more easy-to-grab 
dollars, although they've been milking smokers for 
decades...folks, by the way, who will end up with 
tremendous health problems and contribute to the 
economy by dying before drawing out their social 
security money. And of course teenage smoking has 
been increasing from the time Surgeon General, 
C. Everett Koop started his 1980s campaign to reduce 
teenage smoking.</P>

<P>Drugs/alcohol is another area that our politicians
have consistently screwed up--that's so obvious I 
don't even want to talk about it.</P>

<P>Finally in July of 1998, President Clinton started 
a muffled mumble about the y2k problem (the 
Millennium Bug), something that could cripple main frame 
computers worldwide on December 31, 1999. But why did 
they ignored y2k warnings that were first identified 
more than a decade ago? Does "no money" and "no votes" 
seem like possible reasons?</P>

<P>[ed. note: refer to "Surviving Y2K" linked to the 
index page at http://askcarl.net or 
http://breakfree.net]</P>

<P>I've been called anti-American for my rant-and-rave 
criticism of the bureaucratic system. I don't think 
I'm anti-American. I am, however, anti-politician...
without regard to their party affiliation.</P>

<P>I believe we've spawned a system that selects leaders
for their skill in telling only that "truth" which
benefits the potential for their re-election. Also, 
without regard to all the tears shed at the recent
death of two Capitol Security officers, I think politics
naturally selects folks with a cleaverly covered up 
mean spirit. Good heavens, look what they do to each
other!</P>
<P>
Politically designed semantic rules includes the
phrase "politically correct" which is a rebirth of
the Nixon-era phrase "the necessary lie."</P>

<P>My suggestion is this: Pay little attention to our 
political leaders and instead gather information 
from multiple sources.</P>
<P>
The Internet is a godsend for this. Don't worry about
all the junk that exists here--with a little experience
you will learn to separate the wheat from the chaff.</P>

<P>For example, don't listen to the stuff about the sorry 
state of HMOs and the medical system. Instead, do what 
it takes to NOT NEED the medical system. Anyway, 
Western medicine is a disease-model system attempting 
to function in a chronic degenerative disorder world</P>. 

<P>Without a doubt, you will need medical doctors around 
if you are either injured or infected with a virus,
bacteria, or parasite; but little help is offered for
the prevention of chronic disorders such as 
atheroscleroses and the common cancers (lung, colon,
breast, and prostate). That is, of course, unless you
delay taking care of yourself until it's too late.</P>

<P>The few brave MDs who have spoken out about 20th-century 
prevention are scorned by their peer group. You will 
find a sampling of these folks at http://www.vegsource.com,
One of my personal heroes is physician Bill Harris, who 
can be found at both the askcarl and breakfree websites.</P>

<P>But the quintessential doc thinks of prevention as such
things as a mammogram, ct scan, and the physical exam. 
These things are detection, not prevention. Which do you 
think is better...to find a cancer growing in your lung 
(detection) or quitting smoking (prevention)? Which is 
better; to have bypass surgery, or prevent deposites of 
plaque in a coronary artery?</P>

<P>Okay here comes the selling part. http://askcarl.net 
is not a place for me to sell you audio cassettes. It 
is instead a place where I have put my 30 years of
experience helping folks do better in various aspects 
of their life.</P>

<P>Think of these three realms:</P> 
<P>The Physical/Intellectual/Emotional.</P>

<P>The physical realm must focus on prevention of chronic
degenerative diseases. To do that, I have put my best 
efforts on audio cassettes and workbooks. Examples are 
smoking elimination, weight control, and exercise 
approaches.</P>

<P>In the intellectual realm I offer approaches for such
things as charisma, the home-based business, and 
lifestyles (of the poor and unknown).</P>

<P>The Emotional realm I have programs such as stress 
management and getting over a broken heart.</P>

<P>I have tried to make this site as interactive as possible.
The only way possible is to make myself available using
the AskCarl Confidential Board, and at no charge beyond 
the price of the audio cassette program.</P>

<P>In some ways, I have found that an online interactive 
approach is more powerful than in-office psychotherapy, 
and far less expensive.</P>

<P>Folks have time to focus in on the message they send me,
and I have time to do any necessary research for the 
best answer--something that seldom happens with $100/hour 
in-office sessions. It's also far more confidential than 
the usual clinical session. Over "my dead body" will 
there ever be insurance company folks, office file 
clerks, or lawyers peeking at your file.</P>
<P>
So, what more can I say? Go to the AskCarl Board and 
talk to me...I will most likely answer you on the same 
day, even on week ends and holidays--I work every day.</P>
