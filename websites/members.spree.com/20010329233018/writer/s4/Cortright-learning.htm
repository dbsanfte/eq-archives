	<P>Twenty-four percent of women and 17 percent of
                                  men say they would give up more than three years
                      of life to be thinner. That’s according to a 1997 poll conducted by
                      Psychology Today magazine. </P>

                   <P>   At the same time, studies show that half of American women
                      overestimate the size of their bodies.</P>

                      <P>Sociologists who study the western-world phenomenon of poor body
                      image attribute the problem to a variety of factors, including media
                      and cultural influences, as well as parental and peer messages.
</P>
                  <P>    The advertising industry ties the already complex issue of body
                      image with materialism. A slender body is associated with wealth,
                      health, and attractiveness. A heavier body is associated with sloth,
                      indulgence, and a lack of self-control. </P>

                      <P>Psychological factors can add to the effect of media and culture.
                      Girls who experienced sexual abuse or an emotionally difficult
                      puberty are more prone to body dissatisfaction as adults. So are
                      women who feel they have little control over their lives. 
</P>
                      <P>Women who have felt the most brutal blows from poor body image
                      say it is not a single factor acting in isolation. Jenifer Tracy, who
                      battled bulimia for nine years, says a combination of factors, such as
                      a non-supportive family environment and a poor self-image,
                      snowballed in the presence of cultural influences.
</P>
                 <P>     “If I had love for myself, or love from my family,” Tracy says, “it
                      would not matter what a model looked like, and it would not affect
                      my personal self-esteem.”</P>

               <P>       The Dangers of Body Dissatisfaction<BR>
                      When we realize that it is a combination of influences that lead to
                      body dissatisfaction, we empower ourselves to solve the problem.
                      We can seize power by breaking the chain of these influences
                      wherever we can.</P>

               <P>       Carolyn Strauss is a top plus-size model, author of Specialty
                      Modeling, and a nationally recognized expert on body image issues,
                      from fashion to self-esteem. Her accomplishments now include her
                      own clothing collection featured on the Home Shopping Network.
                      Through it all, she helps other women move toward a more positive
                      body image.  Strauss says the biggest danger of a negative body
                      image lies in the power it gives away.</P>

                     <P> “When someone has a poor body image, she will try to find
                      validation from outside to make her feel better. The next diet, the
                      next fashion fad, the next boyfriend…anything but where she is
                      now. Instead of living in the moment, she may find herself living for
                      ‘when I look better,’” Strauss says. “Remember, the goal of most
                      advertising it to make you ‘not OK’ so that, upon using that product,
                      you will become OK. I say, start OK and then you’ll only buy what
                      you choose to have for yourself.”</P>

                 <P>     Most of us can think of a time when we thought a new haircut, diet,
                      or lipstick would turn everything around for us. But that mindset can
                      lead to a lot of wasted time and money. Constant self-monitoring
                      can also drain your energy, and it can even lead to depression and
                      hostility.</P>

                     <P> A University of Toronto study, published in the International Journal
                      of Eating Disorders, found that women who were interviewed after
                      seeing magazine ads that featured female models showed a
                      significant and immediate decrease in self-esteem.
</P>

<P>
                      Poor body image can lead to crash dieting and excessive exercise,
                      which can, in turn, lead to poor nutrition, injuries, and depression.  In
                      it’s most dangerous form, a negative body image may fuel an eating
                      disorder or Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD).</P>

                      <P>When you are continually distracted with physical appearance, the
                      energy of your mind, body, and spirit is diverted from more salient
                      endeavors.</P>

                   <P>   A more positive body image can help you in all of your roles.
                      Improve your role as a mother by teaching your children how to
                      love their bodies. Improve your physical health. Improve your role
                      as a lover. One study shows that women who are comfortable with
                      their bodies (regardless of size) achieve orgasm more often than
                      those who are more physically self-conscious.</P>

                  <P>    Solutions<BR>
                      Seek Help<BR>
                      If you feel that your body image has become a pre-occupation,
                      don’t hesitate to talk to a counselor or therapist.  Amoreena
                      Brewton, a mother with a background in sociology and counseling,
                      has conducted research on women and body image. She says,
                      “Some people are too deeply entrenched in their body issues to
                      resolve them on their own. Often, there are personal or familial
                      issues at play when a person has an eating disorder, so seeking
                      professional help is highly recommended.” </P>
<P>
                      Tracy agrees. “In the end, my success came from the deep desire
                      to stop, which had been inside of me for years, and then getting into
                      serious therapy with an eating disorder specialist. Having someone
                      who focuses on just that area was a true lifesaver.”
</P>
                <P>      Make small changes<BR>
                      A global change in cultural and economic structures would, no
                      doubt, help us all achieve a more positive body image. But there will
                      likely always be supermodels, paid endorsements, and the
                      unstoppable “quest for the best” bandwagon.</P>

              <P>        Instead, enforce changes on a smaller scale. Brewton suggests we
                      stop allowing those negative forces into our lives. “Don’t buy
                      Cosmo, buy Redbook,” she says. “Look at really powerful,
                      intelligent successful women whom you admire as often as possible.
                      For example: Oprah, Rosie, Hillary, Martha, your mom, your
                      grandmother, your daughter.”</P>

                      <P>Use Positive affirmations<BR>
                      When you catch yourself commiserating over tight blue jeans, don’t
                      let your mind get stuck in the negativity. When that negative voice
                      does emerge, follow it with 10 positive thoughts.  
</P>
                     <P> Tracy says repetition is key. “It begins with re-recording the
                      negative messages in your own mind, which are so painful,” she
                      says. “I have probably re-recorded that message over 500,000
                      times, and I keep losing it. But it’s easier to find for the next time.”
</P>
                      <P>Once you navigate yourself out of the negativity rut, you’ll feel
                      better about yourself, and you’ll better understand your power to
                      create and maintain a healthier mind, body, and spirit.
</P>
                    <P>  Remember your spiritual connection<BR>
                      “The first thing to remember is that the Universe does not make
                      mistakes,” Strauss says. You are where you are for a reason.
                      Acknowledge this and then choose how to proceed with the next
                      minute, hour, day, of your life.”</P>

                      <P>For the religious and spiritual among us, body image may instantly
                      improve with the simple reminder that God gave you the body you
                      have for a reason. He didn’t make you to look like Cindy Crawford
                      because you aren’t Cindy Crawford. He wants you to be healthy
                      enough to do your life’s work. To live and work at an optimum
                      level. So, accept His creation, and nurture it.
</P><P>
                      Gather with supportive friends<BR>
                      Surround yourself with supportive friends. “As I began to recover
                      little by little from bulimia,” Tracy says.  “I did not surround myself
                      with people who were as concerned about body size. I put myself
                      among beautiful, strong, and intelligent women who really put little
                      emphasis on looks.”</P>

             <P>         Brewton also recommends surrounding yourself with friends whose
                      focus is not on exteriors. “Other women can make the biggest
                      difference in our lives by being mentors and leading by example,”
                      Brewton says. She suggests we find a group of women to meet
                      with regularly to discuss issues important to our lives, but, she says,
                      don’t focus solely on body issues. “Obsessing as a group is no better
                      than obsessing as an individual,” she says.</P>

                  <P>    Find a group of supportive women, either in your neighborhood or
                      online. Then use this safe, non-critical environment to empower one
                      another. For tips, read Kimberly Hohman’s insightful article,
                      “Overcoming Our Feline Instincts.”</P>

             <P>         Focus on Health<BR>
                      Change your relationship with food. 
                      Food is fuel for active living. Strive not for a number on the scale
                      but for a weight at which you feel strong and energetic. Ask
                      yourself if your diet contributes – or takes away from - your health
                      and energy levels. (For tips, see “Eating for Energy: The Link
                      Between Food and Mood”).</P>

                  <P>    When we stop focusing on our bodies, and begin to focus on our
                      health, our bodies have an easier time finding our optimal weight.
                      Researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine have
                      discovered that people who start a weight-loss program when they
                      feel happiest about their body are more than twice as likely to lose
                      weight as people who are less satisfied.</P>

                <P>      Tracy proves that we can control how much power food has over
                      us. “One of the most important factors in my success has been to
                      eat everything and anything I want, whenever. I do not diet, restrict,
                      or make rules for myself in any way. This sets my life up so that I
                      don’t ever feel restricted and needy for food. It has taken a lot of
                      the importance out of food for me,” Tracy says. “Since I quit my
                      bulimic behaviors, I have lost 15 pounds, my face and cheeks are
                      not swollen, and I feel really good.”</P>

                      <P>Change your relationship with exercise.<BR>
                      Regular exercise creates power and endurance, which can help you
                      enjoy more activities. Can you hike as far as you like? Would you
                      like to try kayaking? Do you know the joys of a “runner’s high”?
</P>
                    <P>  Find an exercise you enjoy. If you hate aerobic dance, don’t join an
                      aerobics class. If you hate the gym, don’t spend your time there.
                      Instead, experiment with exercises you’ve never tried before. Is
                      there an exercise that makes you feel physically empowered? Do
                      that one. </P>

            <P>          Motivate yourself to exercise by reminding yourself about the burst
                      of energy that inevitably follows a workout. For further motivation,
                      read “Working it Out: The Health Benefits of Exercise", and
                      "Working it Out with Your Kids.”</P>

                  <P>    Change your relationship with your body.<BR>
                      When food becomes a tool for active living, and exercise becomes a
                      tool for increased strength, your body becomes a tool for your mind.
                      Suddenly, your body has the endurance and power to do what the
                      mind wills.</P>
<P>
                      “Our bodies are miracles, walking around in skin,” Brewton says.
                      “You will never come across a finer work of art or machinery.” 
</P>
                     <P> Befriend your body, and ask yourself how you want to spend your
                      life energy. “Imagine for a moment that you took all that time you
                      spend thinking about appearance and focused on how much you
                      love your ability to communicate well, or what a great mom you are,
                      or ways to solve the issue of homelessness,” Brewton says. “If you
                      took that negative energy and used it for good, not only would your
                      life improve, but the world would improve, as well."
</P>
                      <P>Your body is an ally in your life’s work. Respect it as such.
</P>
