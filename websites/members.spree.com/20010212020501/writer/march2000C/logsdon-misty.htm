<U>I.</U>	A beautiful girl in the prime of life,  Misty Reynolds should have known better than to walk to the corner store after midnight.  Especially on a full-moon night in October.  <P align=justify>
It was on full-moon nights, the metropolitan police department reported a year ago, that crazies crawled out of every nook and cranny.  This was when  children disappeared, carried away by the unrelenting tide of evil, their faces appearing on the back of milk cartons months later. This was when bodies filled with bullets were found in the desert of southern Nevada.   <P align=justify>
 Crime had washed through the city for as long as Misty could remember. Born twenty-four years ago,  Misty had attended the city's  schools, was elected prom queen her senior year, played youth soccer in the inner-city leagues, and even won a starting position on the community college's team.  Yet, always,  even in the safety of her parents' home,  she sensed something or someone dark awaiting her in the bushes along her street or in her dreams at night, and occasionally  sensed death's dark wings brush her before she woke. <BR>
<CENTER><HR></CENTER> <P align=justify>
<U>II.</U>	Hours before her walk  to the corner store, she told her boy friend Jason that, contrary to what  many claimed,  evil was tangible, real as molten lava. She wondered what she would do face-to-face with darkness.  "I think I'd run," she speculated  aloud, throwing herself onto her bed next to Jason, who was lying on his back and glumly staring at the ceiling.  "Then, who knows? Maybe I'd fight? What would you do, boyfriend?"
<P align=justify>  
"Hell if I know," muttered Jason, attempting nonchalance. Jesus, thought Jason, still studying the ceiling; here we go again.  It was not the first time he had listened to Misty's inanely incoherent ramblings.  A Bible college dropout with a cross tattooed on his upper left arm, Jason locked his fingers behind his head as he lay on the bed,  cigarette  dangling from his mouth, squinting and blowing smoke that  eventually carried out the open window into the cold night.  He tried to listen to the Beethoven CD he'd inserted in Misty's player.  A young man with a shaved head who generally carried a hand gun, Jason didn't want to believe in much of anything right now except Misty, who sat  against him,  wondering where the passion of  their relationship had gone. 
<P align=justify> 
"You been filling your brain with idle thoughts again?" asked Jason,  glancing sideways at his girl.  Tonight, as every night, Jason wore a black T-shirt with no printing.   "And where the fuck does this question-'What would I do if the devil came calling?'--come from? Where does it come from?"  At twenty-eight, Jason had  had his fill of  superstitions, knew  he didn't want to marry and have children with this woman, even  wondered if she were doing crack.  "And who the hell cares anyway? Evil belongs in Star Wars," he added, taking the cigarette from his mouth, sitting up and looking at Misty.  A man  capable of deep thinking, Jason knew Misty's views would be classified by current intellectuals as medieval or psychotic.    
<P align=justify>
"No, boyfriend, I'm not making anything up.  I believe this stuff. My grandma says she believes in devils, ghosts, vampires, witches, and horrible things  like that, so I do, too, " Misty replied, jumping up from the bed and walking to the window, suddenly feeling chilled.  She had just remembered that her grandmother had died in her sleep just last month.<P align=justify>
Jason  took the cigarette from his mouth, examined the tip, smiled,  thought about forcing a laugh and then decided not to.  "Misty, my best advice to you is to try not to think about this crap. Don't fucking think, okay? At least don't fill your mind with that rubbish better confined to the junk heap with Augustine, Aquinas, and Abelard.   When you think," Jason added, looking down at Misty, who huddled in the blanket up against him, "when anyone thinks  twisted thoughts, they  often get in some kind of  trouble. Now come one over here with me on the bed." <P align=justify>
Misty had heard of Augustine, Aquinas, and Abelard, all brilliant theologians, but said nothing.  She was used to men who insulted her intelligence, thinking she was stupid; teachers and coaches had done it for years, probably because of her good looks.   She had learned that, to  get along, she had to get over the insults.  So she sighed, turned from the window and look at Jason, smiled, and said nothing.  <P align=justify>
Dragging deeply on his cigarette, Jason went on, his eyes focused on an invisible spot on the floor.  "Next thing you know, you'll be having visions, a regular St. Teresa of Avila.  You'll wake up claiming to have seen the Virgin Mary, the Prince of Darkness, or the many rooms in the Kingdom of Heaven.   You know what I mean?"  Jason figured the best way to handle Misty's fancies was through obscure allusions and mild humiliation. His father, a professor at a local university, had used it on him and his mother many times. Besides, since leaving Bible college, Jason didn't want to have a discussion touching upon theology.<P align=justify>
"No, I don't know what you mean, Jason. And, anyway,  I've  been having visions,   if that's what you wanna call them," Misty insisted,  walking over to the bed, sitting next to Jason,   and pulling the top blanket around her.  "I've read about them in class at college.  I bought this book on Western Mysticism last week at the college bookstore.  Evelyn Underhill is the author.  Creepy, creepy shit, but real. You know what I mean?"  At that moment, an extraordinarily cold wind blew through the window, touching both,   and Jason wondered if he had passed into an old Twilight Zone rerun.  <P align=justify>
"Get that nonsense out of your mind, Misty," Jason responded, not wanting to venture into the territory of dreams and the supernatural, having come to believe nonetheless that dreams were often supernatural manifestations. He looked at Misty, put his arm around her shoulders and drew her closer to him.  "No one believes that superstitious horse shit anymore. I sure don't."<P align=justify>
"Well, I do believe in that horse shit," Misty replied,  pulling away, looking at Jason, flinging her head back.  "I do. I have to. I don't care if you or anyone else thinks I'm nuts."<P align=justify>
"OK, babe," muttered Jason,  reaching his arm out  and  pulling her closer again, "you're not crazy.  You're all right.  Sane as a jackrabbit. So go ahead and tell me about it. Your dream or your vision.  Whatever.  Tell me about it. I wanna hear it, as a former theology student gone wild. I really do.  And then, I'm gonna jump your bones." He began stroking her hair.<P align=justify>
Misty paused for a moment, aware that she was being patronized, thought of hitting Jason in the mouth, then closed her eyes, let the smile drop from her face, and thought.  As she did so, she seemed to Jason to  withdraw, something she had done in the past and something that always made Jason nervous. He remembered that she'd withdrawn in restaurants, in movie theaters, at drive-ins, and even at the mall, that when she did she stopped communicating for hours, that it happened only when  he wasn't listening to her ramble about vampires, witches, and warlocks.<P align=justify>
"Just tell me about it," said Jason,  kissing Misty on the forehead, then leaning over her and  the foot of the bed and dropping his cigarette in a Pepsi can on the floor.  On his way back he  reached inside the blanket and under Misty's sweater. "C'mon, I'm listening."  Sometimes, Jason's father  told him some time ago, you gotta play along with the women before you get what you want.  Jason at the time knew exactly what his father had meant, and now the advice came back to him and he decided that he would wait this one out.  <P align=justify>
"It's happened several times," Misty began, growing colder, "always at a certain time during the month, and it always scares the piss outa me." Misty shivered, glanced to the door,  and Jason, knowing she couldn't see it, rolled his eyes in mock credulity.  <P align=justify>
"The first time," she continued, looking straight ahead at the open window, "was about six months ago.  I remember the moon was full and bloody, and a silvery blimp hung suspended over our bright city.  When I began to drift off to sleep, I heard the whisper of a breeze, felt the touch of the wind upon my face, then saw a vivid blue light-like a star--glowing at the foot of my bead and filling my room, and in the light I could see the figure of a man."<P align=justify>
Jason  did not want to hear this, would rather have been down on the Strip with his buddies,  but gently squeezing one of her breasts he let Misty continue. "Wasn't me in the vision, was it?" he asked, hopeful, knowing full well Who it was that stood in the center of the vision. Feeling the mysterious hand of judgment move over the bed, Jason trembled and wondered if he should leave.<P align=justify>
Caught up in vivid recollection, Misty turned and looked in to Jason's eyes, gave Jason the look he would have died a thousand times for, and said, "No, Jason, it wasn't you.     Some man.  Older than you. Bleeding and hanging from   the wooden cross. It was Jesus, I think.  Suffering, weeping, he looked up and spoke to me, told me not to be afraid, that He would be with me until the end of the age.  Or something like that.  Didn't make sense.  I thought I was gonna die. I'm sure it was Jesus."<P align=justify>
Jason knew then that Misty, starting to exude warmth,  was telling a truth-at least as far as she was capable--and possibly, though an occasional bimbo, had the mystic capacity  to apprehend what lay beyond David Hume's natural world in which everything could and must  be explained in terms of natural cause and effects.    At least, he recognized, she had seen something-or thought she had seen something.  <P align=justify>
Misty continued, now putting her head on Jason's shoulder, both moving back on the bed to lean against the wall.  "Every month, about the same time, I have a similar vision, just when I drift off.  This blue light, like a small sun blazing at the foot of my bed, and always the man inside the blue. A first I screamed my head off-Goddamn, did I scream--and that brought both mom and dad running into my room, who told me that I had just had a bad dream and not to worry, to go back to sleep. 'It's the full moon,' my mom said, and I tried to believe her but couldn't. It was my grandmother told me the next week that the dream was real, maybe from God, maybe the spirit world. Said it meant something bad might happen.  Or something good. I dunno."<P align=justify>
Exasperated,   Jason   thought:  this really is getting too weird; it was like what he had read in the textbooks about crazed medieval Christian mystics. It was giving him the creeps.  He wondered if his girl friend had gone too far over the deep end and hoped she wouldn't soon start speaking in tongues.  <P align=justify>
"It's just a damned dream," he said, trying to assure himself as well as his girl that the vision could not be  true but knowing better and  desperately  wanting to  move on.  He pulled Misty over onto him. "Or," he added jokingly, "a dream of the damned."  <P align=justify>
"I think it's God in that dream," said Misty, allowing Jason to lightly kiss her on the mouth.  Smelling of smoke, Jason always kissed gently at first.<P align=justify>
Holding her head in her hands, kissing him on the mouth and allowing him to run his hands over her body, she grew warm under Jason's touch and purred, "Yes, Jason, I think it's God."<P align=justify>
"I think you're right, girl," Jason whispered, now fully aroused, feeling Beethoven fill him, loosening Misty's pants and sliding his hands down onto her bare ass. <BR><CENTER><HR></CENTER><P align=justify>
<U>III.</U>  After Jason left around ten, walking down the stairs and saying good night to her sickly parents(Her father was recovering from a heart attack, following his mother's death), Misty stayed in her room, turned on the television, and thought about the wonderful time she had just had. Making love, she had decided, was like going to heaven.  She had heard of St. Teresa of Avila, about the vision God had given her of the crystal castle with infinite rooms, and wondered if as a nun Teresa had ever known human passion.  Misty was thankful she had.<P align=justify>
 	Sleepily, she reached over to the table next to her bed, saw Jason's gun, realized he had accidentally left it behind and would therefore likely return for it, reached out, and held and caressed the small pocket-sized weapon.  Always, when making love with her, Jason would take the gun from his jacket and place it where he could see it.  This time, he had forgotten it.    On the cable station, an old Lana Turner movie was playing, and as she relaxed and let herself drift off she wondered what it would have been like to be Lana Turner.<BR><CENTER><HR></CENTER><P align=justify>
<U>IV</U>.	When she awoke, it was after one.  The television was still on, and she recognized Robert Mitchum in the 1950's film version of the Raymond Chandler classic Fair Well, My Lovely.  It was a good movie, almost better than the book, which Misty had read several years ago.  She wondered, for an instant, if she could kill a man like Philip Marlow, the detective-hero of Chandler's novels.<P align=justify>
Sitting up in bed, she felt empty and  hungry and knew that she wouldn't go back to sleep for at least an hour, and, since tomorrow was  Friday and she had only one class early in the afternoon, she decided to get dressed and walk down to the corner convenience store to buy some soda and anything else that looked appetizing. She arose,  put on her jeans, her blue sweater with an LA  Lakers logo on the front, and then her black leather jacket that had her name written across the back in bold red letters.  <P align=justify>
Finally, to feel what it was like, just once, she decided to take the gun, which she put into one of the deep pockets of the jacket.  Although she had gone with Jason to target practice and had reeled off a few rounds herself(never missing her target), Misty  had not carried a gun with her before.  Then she turned off her TV.<P align=justify>
Stepping softly down the carpeted stairs, she knew her parents, now in their early sixties  had probably been in bed for three hours at least and so she gently opened the door to let herself out into the cool October night, softly shutting the door behind her. Outside, she felt strangely different, even more alive. She felt in her pocket for the cold barrel  and knew the surge of power that she had heard often comes from carrying a weapon.  <P align=justify>
As she walked down the short sidewalk towards the street, thinking about Jason's gun, she looked overhead at the enormous full moon, beautifully illuminating the night sky,  and felt thankful that she had worn her leather jacket.  Fingering the gun, she felt good as she walked  the empty street, conscious of all the lives in the houses lining the block, glad she was Misty Reynolds and not the dentist's daughter who lived on the corner, and thought about her class the next day.  Taught by Dr. Wilbur Frost, Introduction to Western Religions had become her favorite class, Frost's lectures frequently touching upon rituals, customs, and belief that she wished were still part of a society that seemed more intent on monitoring the sales of drugs and the spread of violent crime than upon providing for itself  a framework that could, possibly, give meaning to her own  confusing life.
