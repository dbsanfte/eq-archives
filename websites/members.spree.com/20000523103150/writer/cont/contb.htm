I was born and raised in Southern California, where I still live with my 
7-year-old son.  I also have two other sons, a daughter and two grandsons. I began writing poetry spontaneously at the age of 13 (thirty years ago) and haven't been able to stop yet.</FONT>

<FONT color="#DF4800"><p><FONT size="+1"><U>Sean Bamman   </U></font>
I was born and raised outside of Washington, DC in
Arlington, VA. My grandmother (who happens to be a
very wonderful, kind lady if you're ever in DC) raised
me due to my mother's lack of interest in any of her
children's lives. I have never met my father.  I have
written on a regular basis since childhood. 
<p>
I am currently a high school teacher in the Tidewater
area of Virginia.  I teach three literature, two world
history and one art history class.  I graduated from
the University of Virginia in 1996.  I am currently
learning Russian at night with plans to some day get a
PhD in Russian Literature.  My wife and I were married
during a 21 hour trip to Las Vegas.  We just
celebrated our two year anniversary.

<FONT color="#D20069"><P><FONT size="+1"><U>Ryan Barber</U></FONT> I believe I have always been a poet, it just took a long time for me
to proclaim it to myself.  I am a seeker, tying the truths of the world
so that nothing can be excluded.  I imagine this is a longer than
lifetime pursuit. Poetry is my way of expressing life, revelation, and
passion with some semblance of clarity.  For now, I manage and buy for
an outfitting store, own and operate a climbing shoe resoling business,
and a myriad of other odd jobs to keep the loose ends tied.  I live when
I am in the mountains, church if you will, and pay for my stay in
society by working in Albuquerque. </FONT>

A man for all seasons, Don has been a journalist, editor, news announcer,
disk jockey, photographer, photojournalist, feature writer, pants presser
for Lee Jeans, delivery car driver, television personality and systems <img src="don-barbera.jpg" align=left>
consultant. At times he has been sinner and saint, rich and poor, lost and
found and always involved in what is going on. For redemption, Don teaches
part-time as an English professor at a local Dallas university. Don has been
a professional musician for more than 20 years. His loves are painting,
drawing and writing.
<P>He is educated.  He admits to degrees in journalism, business, English and
other areas but sees little value in them other than he managed to persevere
to get his sheepskin (fake) -- but his mother loved it.
<P>Don is irreverent, testy, salty, holier than thou, opinionated, soft, hard
as nails, inquisitive and totally undeterred by establishment procedures.
Writing: The majority of Don's work has been in the corporate designing
training curriculum, marketing collaterals, corporate presentations,
speeches and public speaking. However, before joining the corporate world
Don wrote and edited for a small newspaper <I>The Pittsburg Morning Sun</I> in
Pittsburg, Kansas. He later worked as a reported, editor and photographer
with the <I>Tulsa Tribune</I>. During that time, he was also a stringer for the
<I>Wichita Eagle</I> and the<I> Kansas City Star.</I> Don's other work includes numerous appearances in small art and poetry magazines and various opinion columns.</FONT>

considers himself to be a "defrocked" astrophysicist,              having graduated with degrees in physics and astronomy. In order to              live, he took a job as a software engineer and has been at it since              1979. He used to write to help himself out during times of depression.              Interestingly enough, his life has apparently been good for the last              fifteen years. Of course, having a family with two small children does              make it slightly difficult to keep up with any literary pursuits. So              perhaps some encouragement from some fans would spur his              creative juices. Michael had originally published "Toll Road" in the              "The Cat's Eye", a defunct ezine. He has recently published some of              his science fiction endeavors in the Planet Magazine ;, which              currently contains a story "That Takes The Cake". <A href="http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/9634">His Web site</A> has              more of his writing, including juvenile science fiction, astronomical              non-fiction, and religious humor pieces </FONT>

<FONT color="#D24400"><U><FONT size="+1">Melissa Beynon</FONT></U> Melissa is a 23-year-old college student in northeastern Ohio working
part time on campus as an Office Assistant. When she graduates with a BA
in English in December 1999 she hopes to secure a job with a publishing
house to use her skills in editing and public relations. She has a
sincere love for all genres of fiction and is rarely seen without a book
in her coat pocket or purse. This love has taken two other forms, that
of a personal website,<A href="(http://www.angelfire.com/mb/BeynonTales"> Beynon Tales</A>
, and a monthly e-zine called
<A href="http://www.geocities.com/Paris/Metro/3296">Short Story Writers Showcase</A>
. She considers herself to be
a short romantic fiction writer who enjoys experimenting with point of
view and conflict. Her stories have been published all over the Internet
in the past three years, and she is hoping for magazine publication in
the near future. She believes that everyone is a storyteller, merely
telling their stories in different ways.

<FONT color="#FF53A9"><U><FONT size="+1">John Birkbeck</FONT></U> <font size="-1">     My main literary interest is in poetry, and I'm concerned with the great range of what is
         being written in the present. In my own experience of reading, and in writing for other
              web-zines, world-wide, I've come to see that there is a lot of poetry being written in in
              these times. And a lot of it is simply fantastic! 
<BR>
                

              What is incomprehensible to me is that, although the market for poetry seems to be a
              hard sell, and that there seems to be a shrinking venue for poetry, in the paper world,
              there are at the same time, more people than ever reading and writing it. 

<BR>                

              The glory of the Internet is that it's possible for publishers to provide venues for poetry at
<img src="johnb.jpg" "align=left">              a fraction of the cost of putting out a publicaton on paper. Thus, these publications can
              afford to take risks on publishing the new and the unknown and the untried voices out
              there, that a paper journal, with rising costs of materials and overhead, are sadly, unable
              to do.</FONT></FONT>
