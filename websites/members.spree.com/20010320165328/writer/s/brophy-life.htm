	<P>My life has recently gone through a dramatic change. I've 
been an entrepreneur and businessperson most of my adult 
life and thought I had my life priorities pretty well in 
hand.  I was - and still am - deeply involved with an 
Internet e-commerce business based upon the work I'd been 
doing for the past seven or eight years.</P>

<P>By fluke circumstance I met a man by the name of Mitch 
Axelrod who introduced me to a science - axiology - and 
tool - the Hartman Value Profile - that I'd never heard 
of. And, because I've been interested in personal 
development and human potential for many years, I decided 
to take the Value Profile myself.</P>

<P>When I took the Value Profile I expected to learn a few 
things about myself. What I got totally knocked me out. 
It was infinitely more than I'd expected.</P>

<P>I discovered that although I was crystal clear about many 
things, I wasn't living my life in the manner that I REALLY
wanted. What I read and learned about myself struck a chord
within me that I just couldn't ignore. When I saw what I 
was paying attention to in my own life - actually, what I 
was NOT paying attention to - it was as if my eyes were 
fully open for the first time to what it was I should be 
doing with my life.</P>

<P>The person that introduced me to the Value Profile, Mitch 
Axelrod, provided a feedback session that gave me a most 
valuable insight into my own strengths and - dare I even 
say it - weaknesses. (Mitch would gently call it my 
"developmental areas"). I didn't even know how 'lucky' 
I was to have him help me through this experience.</P> 

<P>What I didn't know is that Mitch is the 'consultants 
consultant'. Jay Abraham, one of today's most respected 
and sought after marketing consultants, says of him, "If 
you want to increase business, call Mitch." Neat 
coincidence, eh? </P>

<P>The benefit of the Value Profile to me is immeasurable. 
I learned where my true values - and strengths - lie. 
That knowledge has encouraged and empowered me to follow 
my true joy. That's in helping others through their own 
gateway of understanding so they can live a fuller, more 
productive and joy-filled life.</P>
<P>
Harvey Schoof, a business associate of Mitch's who's been 
working with the Value Profile for the past 12 years,
describes the purpose of the Value Profile like this. He 
says, "This instrument is designed to help you understand 
how you think and why you do what you do. Why you're 
getting the results you are in your life. You already 
know what results you're getting - you don't need a 
profile to tell you that.</P>
<P>
"You need to understand WHY things are happening so you can
start to understand what you can use that will help you be 
more effective. And, what things you need to work on or get
help working on that are potential problem areas for you."</P>

<P>I found that the Value Profile is designed to teach you 
how to maximize your strengths to get more out of life 
emotionally, psychologically, spiritually, physically, 
personally and financially.</P>
<P>
For me - and, as I've learned, for many others that have 
had this experience - knowing your own 'values' is the 
gateway of opportunity for living a memorable life. It's 
the bridge from where I was to where I want to be.</P>

<P>If you want to learn more about the Value Profile, send for 
a six page report titled, "Making the Most of Your Life".
It's a most worthwhile read. No obligation. Just send a
blank email to mailto:send-value@findmorebuyers.com and 
the article will be sent to you by autoresponder.</P>

<P>What the heck. None of us are getting' out alive. Why not 
make it a memorable ride?</P>
