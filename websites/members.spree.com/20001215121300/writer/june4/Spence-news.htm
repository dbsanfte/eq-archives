<P>One of the biggest strengths of the Internet is its ability
to bring groups of like-minded people together.</P>

<P>You are probably reading this article because it was
passed to you by a friend, or you came across it by
networking with other people. This is an excellent example
of how networking with others can bring you worthwhile
resources (at least I hope you find this article a
worthwhile resource!)</P>

<P>When I first came online about 5 years ago I was
overwhelmed at the huge number of websites available to me
and the bewildering array of search engines that could get
me there. In one way I was fortunate in that I was already
computer literate before I found my first Internet Service
Provider (ISP). For those of you that are fighting with the
technology, or who feel uncomfortable with it, the Internet
can be an intimidating place.</P>

<P>This is why finding like-minded people can bring comfort to
you, because you realize you are not the only one who feels
lost! Also you can use peer groups to help you find
information you need to complete your next article, or to
answer a question about a topic you are covering at a
seminar the following week.</P>

<P>So how do we find these helpful, online networkers?</P>
<P>
The first place to look is for online Newgroups and Forums.
You may have heard the term USENET Newsgroup used by people
on the Net. These are subject related groups where people
meet to discuss a topic of common interest to the group.
Newsgroups were the first meeting places set-up when the
Net became established. You can find thousands of
newsgroups on the net so you need to be able to home in the
ones that are going to benefit you.</P>

<P>The best place to start is DejaNews at
http://www.dejanews.com . This is a website designed to
help you find a newsgroup dedicated to your subject area.
It also allows you to browse online the messages posted to
the group and to post messages yourself.</P>

<P>Before you post messages it is wise to lurk for a while and
see what people are discussing. You can then decide whether
you have joined the correct group for your needs. Once you
decide you are in the right place you should read the
groups FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) which will be a
list of the questions asked by new members about the policy
of the group, how to post, what types of messages are and
are not acceptable, etc. If you ignore these you may anger
other list members with your postings and may start to
receive email you would rather not have!</P>
<P>
DejaNews makes it easy to find and read these FAQ's.</P>

<P>If you do not have a permanent connection to the Internet,
and therefore it may be costing you money to read the
postings, you need to get yourself a newsgroup reader. This
is a piece of software that will download the messages to
your PC so that you can read them offline. This software
will also let you join and leave newsgroups as you wish and
will upload your postings in a batch.</P>

<P>There are loads of these readers on the Internet, some are
good, some not so good. I recommend you use a product
called Free Agent, which as it name suggests is FREE. You
can download it from http://www.forteinc.com .</P>

<P>I use it myself and it is brilliant! By the way, I do not
earn a commission for recommending it!</P>
<P>
Free Agent has lots of nice features for following
discussion threads and can download only those threads that
you are really interested in.</P>

<P>Forums are another place to meet other people. They are
similar to newsgroups but generally all postings and
discussions are conducted on the Web. To find an
appropriate forum a good place to start is
http://www.forumone.com which has a search engine. You
can also find forums by subject.</P>

<P>Another good place to go is http://www.liszt.com where
you can search newsgroups, forums, and other resources all
in one go! You will also find mailing lists here where
postings are sent to your email box everyday.</P>
<P>Unfortunately many newsgroups tend to have messages posted
to them that are totally irrelevant to the subject being
covered. Everything from sex sites, business opportunities
and adverts will appear in most newsgroups.
</P>
<P>A lot of the forums and mailing lists are moderated. This
means a human being reviews each attempted posting before
it is seen by everyone else and therefore most non-relevant
postings are deleted.</P>

<P>For this reason I would suggest you participate in forums
and mailing lists so you do not have to wade through a sea
of rubbish before you get to the good stuff!</P>

<P>These resources will only be as helpful and effective as
the members who participate. Those lists that have a
moderator who knows his or her stuff are especially useful.</P>

<P>The only way you will know what works for you is to try
them out. You can always unsubscribe from a list if it does
not work for you.</P>


<STRONG><P><U>Summary</U></P></STRONG>


<P>Newsgroups, Forums and Mailing Lists can provide a wealth
of expertise and a valuable means to network with
like-minded people. Using the resources mentioned in this
article you should be able to find a group that addresses
your area of interest and introduces you to people who are
only too willing to help.</P>

<P>The biggest challenge for you is to wade through the
thousands of groups on the Net. Hopefully I have been able
to give you a solid starting point and an approach that
will help you to very quickly identify your peers online.</P>
