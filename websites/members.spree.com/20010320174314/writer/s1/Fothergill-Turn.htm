	<P>You see, "little foxes" destroy grape vines by chewing
them off at the root. Indeed, it's the "little foxes"
or seemingly small habits, that cut the "vine" of
success off at the root. Procrastination, watching too
much TV,taking too much "time off" are all habits that
can derail your business before it ever gets off the
ground.</P>

<P>There have been many books, talks and tapes on the
subject of "The habits of highly successful people."
In a nutshell, they all say the same thing, "Look at
what successful people do consistently, develop those
habits and success will come your way."  In other
words, if you spend more time developing good habits,
the bad ones will give way.  Accentuate the positive!</P>

<P>A habit is like a winter coat, It is something you
either put on or take off, depending on the situation.
Obviously, if it's 20 degrees outside, you need that
coat, but if it's 80 you don't.  A habit is the same way.
If it's killing or stunting the growth of your business,
you need to take it off.  If it will make you successful,
you need to put it on. So how do you change?  It's
actually very simple.  Do an examintation and make
the appropriate changes.  Here are the steps to follow
when turning habits into have-its.</P>
<P>
1.  Identify:  Examine your life and determine what
negative habits are holding you back. Is it procras-
tination? Watching too much TV?  Fear? Also look at
what positive habits you must develop that will make
you successful. Is it making more contacts?  Using
your products? Following the system? Negative habits
have to go!   Positive habits must be developed and
strengthened.</P>
<P>
2. List: On a piece of paper, make two columns and list
all of your habits, negative and positive.  Then priori-
tize them according to which ones you feel your business
would benefit most from developing or losing.  This list
should include any personal traits that you feel project
a poor image.</P>

<P>3.  Commit to change:  Once you have identified the
habits you need to change, begin the process.  It is not
a good thing to try to change everything at once, so
look at your prioritized list and pick the one or few
that you are going to work on first.  You will find that
there are things you should learn NOT to do and some you
must learn TO do.  Bear in mind, that depending on what
"expert" you listen to, it takes from 21 to 30 days to
develop or break a habit. Therefore, when you've
identified the habit(s) you are going to work on, be
prepared to make at least a 30 day commitment to your
changed life pattern.  Once the new habit is developed,
it is no longer something you work on, but something that
just happens, every day.</P>

<P>3.  Reward:  Once your habit of success has been
developed, you will begin to see the reward for your
hard work. Enjoy it, but don't get lazy and  complacent.</P>

<P>4.  New Action (Continued growth): Go back through
your list and identify the next most important habit(s)
you  must develop, and begin working on them. If you
sit back and wallow in the reward stage, you'll never
go any farther.</P>

<P>In summary, developing successful habits is a repeating
process.  You must constantly identify, commit to change
and receive the reward. If you concentrate on changing
all your habits to successful ones, then you will change
your life pattern of habits into "have-its"!</P>
