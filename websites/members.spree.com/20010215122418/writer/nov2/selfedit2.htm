<I><U><FONT color="#FF0000">it's, its</FONT></U></I>
<BR><P align=justify>The contraction "it's" is a contraction for "it is," "it was," or "it has," and does not connote ownership or possessiveness in any sense.  The word "its" without an apostrophe is both the possessive and the plural form of "it."<BR><P align=justify>
<FONT color="#004080">The improper use:  "It's tail wagged as it looked at the food.  It barked, 'Its been two days since I had a meal.'"</FONT><BR><P align=justify>
Translating the above would make the sentence read "It is tail wagged ... Mine been two days..."<BR><P align=justify>
<FONT color="#008000">The proper use:  "Its tail wagged as it looked at the food.  It barked, 'It's been two days since I had a meal.'"
</FONT>
<BR><P align=justify>
<FONT color="#FF0000"><U><I>impacted</I></U></FONT><BR><P align=justify>
While a tooth can be impacted, little else can.  "The news visibly impacted John."  Why did the news impacted him?  Did he need to visit the dentist?
<BR><P align=justify>
<FONT color="#FF0000"><U><I>there, they're, their</I></U></FONT><BR><P align=justify>
Certain grammar checkers (I refuse to accuse Microsoft Word's bug riddled features outright, and thus I dodge a libel suit) try to replace "their," with "there," because it detects an improper usage.  When this occurs, there actually is a problem with the sentence, but replacing a "plural for proper nouns," with a "specified location," is not the solution.  The proper solution is covered in the next usage note.  Try to remember what each of these words actually mean in context.<BR><P align=justify>
<FONT color="#004080">The improper usage:  "There running out of time to complete they're project over their.</FONT>"<BR><P align=justify>
<FONT color="#008000">The proper usage:  "They're running out of time to complete their project over there."

<FONT color="#FF0000"><U><I>his, her / their, he, she / they</I></U></FONT>
<BR><P>The English language has no gender-free nonspecific pronoun that refers to "people."  This is primarily because English, as a language, is the bastard child of nearly every Romance language and some Greek and Hebrew thrown in for good measure.  Nevertheless, when attempting to refer to an instance where the person described could either be male or female, it is difficult to think of an original phraseology.  Many writers feel it is necessary in this age of rampant feminism and political correctness to write so as not to offend anyone.
<BR><P align=justify>For example, if Neil Edwin Armstrong stepped off of the Apollo 11 Lunar Landing module Eagle tomorrow and said, "One small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind," I have no doubt that a wave of backlash would set in amongst the pundits of the media criticizing his usage.  Stories would appear like the following:
<BR><P align=justify>"Ultra-left-wing feminist spokesperson, Ms. Ima Boutoo Ruin-English, said, 'Mr. Armstrong was not sensitive to the needs of women in his remarks.  He would have been better advised to say, 'I, a gender-free person who happened to be fortunate enough to be in the right place at the right time, just perambulated a smallish nonspecific distance in order that personkind could perambulate a much greater nonspecific distance."
<BR><P align=justify>There are a few problems with this.  First of all, there is no such word as "personkind."  Second, what kind of dreck is that to read or hear?  The recent effect of political correctness on literature, and I say this in the least possible misogynistic manner, has been ultimately and dreadfully deleterious and detrimental.
<BR><P align=justify>If we rewrite another familiar passage so as not to offend anyone's sensibilities, take a long look at the result:
<BR><P align=justify>When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's nonspecific deity or supreme power in which a person may or may not believe in, entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of personkind, animalkind, and plantkind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.--
<BR><P align=justify>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men or women or plantlife or companion animals (which include but are not limited to goldfish, cockroaches, cows, chickens, spiders, and the spotted owl), are created equal, that they are endowed by their nonspecific deity or supreme power in which that person or animal or plant  may or may not specifically believe in and who or which may or may not exist, with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of political correctness.--
