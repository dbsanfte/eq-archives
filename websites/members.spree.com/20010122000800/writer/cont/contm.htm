                 refuse to believe it is because of any thing other than just pure luck.......so I would say to anyone who
                 has the inkling to write should write and write a lot.....if about nothing if anything at all....because the
                 secret to life lies between that whisper and the infinite giggle of time.....teeehee........oh and i have 4
                 kids...should that explain my insanity? <A HREF="http://meltingpot.fortunecity.com/finland/449/index2.html" TARGET="_blank">Kims Magick Whispers</A> -- poetry, stories, and meditations </FONT>
