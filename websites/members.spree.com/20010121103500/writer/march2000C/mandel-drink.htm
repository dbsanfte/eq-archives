Why I Drink
<BR>
                       
   <FONT size="+2"> © Jerome Mandel</FONT>

<P align=justify>
Everyone wants to know.  Talent wasted.  Like that.  Someone's got to
take the blame.  So I tell them it's my parents.
<P align=justify>
"Oh, you poor boy," Em says.  She rests her fingers on my wrist when she
talks to me.  As if pulse were the short way to heart.
<P align=justify>
"You need the love of a good woman."  She smiles.  She has these
crinkles.  She's been around, read too many Harlequin romances.
<P align=justify>
"I need the love of a good waitress."
<P align=justify>
Where we sit, a good waitress is hard to find.  Lots of transients.
Girls from the town trying to be college girls.  Girls from the college
trying to make it.  No one's much interested in keeping the liquid
flowing downhill.  Unnatural.
<P align=justify>
"You were always ..."
<P align=justify>
Hallman was with me in Athens, knows all about my misspent youth, and I
know his.  He did football and women.  Keeping score.  Fell into despair
when Clemson beat the Bulldogs 38-17.  Decided to extend the
woman-season to the end of the school year.  Now he owns a photo
archive.  Solid citizen.  Sells other people's pictures.  It's enough to
make anyone drink.
<P align=justify>
"... but this is the first time I hear it's because of your parents," he
said.
<P align=justify>
"Did they beat you?" said Em.
<P align=justify>
"No," said Hallman, "they caught him having unnatural sex with animals."
<P align=justify>
"O ye city-folk of little imagination," I had to laugh.  "You think sex
with animals is unnatural?"
<P align=justify>
"All sex is unnatural," Hallman said.
<P align=justify>
"I think sex with animals is unnatural," said Em.  Crinkling.
<P align=justify>
"Are you speaking from experience?" I said.
<P align=justify>
"Well, it can't be any fun."
<P align=justify>
"For you or for the animal?"
<P align=justify>
"No," said Em.  "Too fast and too furry."
<P align=justify>
"You are right in one respect," I said.<P align=justify>
"What?"
<P align=justify>
"No foreplay," I said.  "And afterwards you can't share a cigarette."
<P align=justify>
Everybody laughed.<P align=justify>
"And how do you keep from laughing," said Hallman, "when you're in bed
with a sheep who has this fag dangling from her lip."
<P align=justify>
"Derivative," I said.  "You're such a city slicker.  You don't do it in
bed.  You grab her in the field.  Hold her down.  Lie on top of her.
She becomes her own mattress."

"Reminds me of you in college," said Hallman.  "Fucking a mattress."
<P align=justify>
"It's unnatural," said Em, "because there are no children."
<P align=justify>
"What about the Minotaur?"
<P align=justify>
"Yeah!  What about the Minotaur?"
<P align=justify>
Em looked from me to Hallman and back.  Smiling and crinkling.
Crinkling and smiling.
<P align=justify>
"So what did your parents do to you?" she asked.  She sipped white wine.
<P align=justify>
"Yeah," said Hallman.
<P align=justify>
"They left me money."
<P align=justify>
"So that's why you drink?" Em asked.  "Your parents left you money?"<P align=justify>
"A crime against humanity," said Hallman.<P align=justify>

"Well, it wasn't all, like, that straight," I said.  "First my father
had to kill my mother."
<P align=justify>
She looked at me amazed.  Even Hallman was surprised, smiled nervously,
eyes wide.
<P align=justify>
"Oh, my God!" moaned Em.
"Why did he do it?"
<P align=justify>
"He killed her because of another woman."
I waited a beat, and then I said, "Hers."
<P align=justify>
She looked at me hard to see if I was lying.
<P align=justify>
"Said he felt dirty," I said.  "Said he felt betrayed."
I was drinking rye and water.
<P align=justify>
"Said he felt he wasn't a man, doing what a woman was doing to her."
<P align=justify>
"Unnatural," said Hallman.
<P align=justify>
"Nobody asked me how I felt," I said.  "An accidental birth.  Someone's
son."
<P align=justify>
"Ohh," said Em, looking at me with soulful eyes, her face falling into
the shape of consolation, always predictable.
<P align=justify>
"So they caught him and hung him and I got the money."
<P align=justify>
"You poor boy."
<P align=justify>
"I sold the farm.  Lock, stock, and doghouse. Look," I said.  "Some is
in property.  Some is in stocks and bonds.  I get bundles of paper every
month: reports, statements, balance sheets, and bullshit.  Sometimes I
can't make heads or tails out of it.  But in an ordinary year, all
things considered, at say six percent, I make maybe ninety thousand
after taxes.  Now, ninety thousand divided by twelve gives seven
thousand five a month.  And if you divide that by roughly
thirty-point-five, it comes to almost two hundred and fifty dollars a
day.  Rain or shine."
<P align=justify>
"That's wonderful!" said Em.
<P align=justify>
"But think of the responsibility," I said.  "And in a bad year? when I
make maybe eight or ten percent? it's worse.  I'll never get even."
<P align=justify>
"But think of what you can have," said Em.  "A house.  A life.
Children.  A garden.  All you need is focus.  Direction.  A good wife
who loves you."
<P align=justify>
Crinkling.<P align=justify>
She raised her glass to me.  I touched my glass to hers.<P align=justify>

"I had those dreams once," I said.  "A house.  Tennis court.  Pool.
Meredith, the good wife, was doing the children.  She distributed focus
and direction as if they were chocolate-chip cookies.  To everyone.
Then I got the money.  And then real life got in the way of that life."
<P align=justify>
Em looked at me eyes awash.  "I love that life,!" she said.
<P align=justify>
Crinkling.  Smiling.<P align=justify>
"Fuck that shit," I said.  I looked up at the game.  I drank the rye.
Alcohol brings out everyone's dreams.  Maybe it's the color: royal
purple, sepia-gold.  Once it's in your blood, you think everything's
possible: conquer the world, drive home, avoid misery.  But nobody does.
<P align=justify>
One of the good things about drink is that it's always with you.  It's
not like a wife.  Or like kids who come whining at you, "Daddy, stop
drinking", you can give them a smack and send them out to play.
<P align=justify>
It's a good friend.  Like Hallman.  Comfortable.  Somebody you meet no
matter where you are.  It doesn't smile and it doesn't crinkle.  It's
just there.  Always.  Unthreatening.  Undemanding. The way life ought to
be.<P align=justify>
"Let's go," said Em.<P align=justify>
Hallman said "Where?"
 and I said "Why?"
<P align=justify>
"I want something better than bar food."<P align=justify>
"Where?"<P align=justify>
"Let's go to Gepetto's.  Down on Barnstable."<P align=justify>
"They have Chianti here," I said.<P align=justify>
"Let's go."  She rested her fingers on my thigh.<P align=justify>
"They have Chianti here," I said.<P align=justify>
"Gepetto's is good," Hallman said.  In that year of dreadful scoring,
there were some Italians with names rich in vowels "Lucia, Gianbattista,
Bonaventura, Alisandrina" no one remembers them all, but Hallman thinks
he's some kind of expert on Italian.  By osmosis.  Came up his dick.<P align=justify>
Hallman waved at the waitress.
"Check, please."
"Chianti," I said.<P align=justify>
"Glass or bottle?"<P align=justify>
"Bottle," I said.<P align=justify>
"I want to go," said Em.  "Is anybody coming?"<P align=justify>
"I will," said Hallman, a cheerful predator.<P align=justify>
She gave me her tight-lipped, compassionate smile, the promise of pity.
And then she got up to leave.<P align=justify>
Hallman slid out of the booth and stood beside me, looking after her.
I looked up at him smiling.<P align=justify>
"Nice touch," said Hallman.<P align=justify>
I poured the Chianti.<P align=justify>
Lovingly.
