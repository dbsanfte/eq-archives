                                              hiatus I have written seventy-two short stories for E-zines

                                              litigation, I wrote "A Writer’s Life" column for The Quill. I

<P>Born at a dividing line in history, (1939) Sandra has been on the

cutting edge of change ever since.  She attributes the timing of

fateful

events to the Hand of God, including the ultimately life saving

chance

sighting of a letter which indicated she was an adopted child, to

locating three children who were kidnapped by their father.

Locating

her birth mother and learning of cancer in the family tree prompted

a

medical examination that revealed she was dying to know the truth.</P>



<P>Sandra has two other adult children.  One, is a son who is mentally

ill.

To her, he is as a bird with a broken wing. She has been involved

in

many adventures and travel including building a home and living in

Spain.</P>



<P>Sandra began pursuing profitable freelance writing following her

cancer

encounter and survival.  Now living in the San Antonio, Texas area,

she

is a spokesperson for the American Cancer Society and National

Cancer

Survivors Day, and available for inspiration and survivorship

subjects.

Taking charge of your own life is a theme Sandra has lived and

encourages others to wholeheartedly grasp.</P>

started writing about five years ago. This was in a period in which I was ready to graduate from

                 school, and I had to wait for a few mandatory classes to be available for me to enroll. The concept was

                 simple. I take dance, piano, singing, and poetry. These are such things I

                 should learn so I can be a well-rounded person. I could also have my choice

                 in women; they dig a good dancer and a sensitive poet, right? As with many

                 things in life, things never go as planned. I learned the stupidity of that

                 logic and the value of these classes for myself. And ever since, I have found

                 that reading and writing poetry has made me a better person, a modern day

                 Renaissance man. I can always get the girls later, right? Visit Alex at his

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#804000" SIZE="-1">


 <P>was born 1945 in Manchester, England. He grew up

in a poor 

neighborhood in the inner city called Hightown. Although the area

was in 

decline Michael was always on a high in his town. Nobody told him

he was poor 

so he was never aware of his poverty. He always was laughing and

joking. He 

left school at sixteen with no qualifications and did not stay long

at any 

one job. When he was nineteen, married and a child on the way, he

started his 

own business with sixty dollars worth of stock. He sold cloth

remnants on 

street markets. It was here Michael started to learn the philosophy

of life. </P>



<P>    Every day was a joy. Michael has always known there is not

enough days in 

anyone's life to think otherwise. By the time he was twenty-eight,

he had 

built a substantial wholesale textile business. He also went into

commercial 

property and dealt in commodity and stock markets. He remarried in

1982, and 

has lived in Florida since 1992. </P>



 <P>   From his earliest recollection, he always knew there was a

force inside 

him that could not fail, despite all the people around telling him,

"How 

stupid he was" and "he will never amount to much with such a

carefree 

attitude." The more negative forces that were put his way the more

joyful the 

experience became. 

</P>

<P>    Nothing was ever that important and if things didn't work out

well, there 

were always another day. There were very few days when he could not

see the 

positive side to life. When he came to live in Florida, he had time

to 

reflect on what took him to this point. Michael has now become an 

International Guru. A Prophet of Joy and we all can Profit from

JOY. </P>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1">From 1986 to 1996, I taught English at the University of the

Virgin Islands, St. Thomas campus.  In February, 1992, while visiting

friends in New Hampshire, our twenty year old daughter Chrissy died in a

car accident.  In February, 1994, our son Jozef was born.  Although I

have written steadily since my daughter’s death, it is only now that I

am beginning to seek markets for my work.  I have had the following

books of poetry published:  The Brushwood Gate (translations of Wang

Wei), Black Buzzard Press, 1984; Spring Street Blues (poems on

penitentiary  life), Black Bear Press, 1986; Three Islands (with Cooper and

Parris), University of the Virgin Islands, 1987; Tremors (with Cooper),

University of the Virgin Islands, 1989; Near the Narcotic Sea,

Cottage Wordsmiths, 1992.  I am currently teaching English at Mercyhurst

College North East near the shores of Lake Erie

<P> is a graduate from the University of Cape Town in South

Africa... but he has learnt far more from the "school of hard knocks" and the

University of Life...

battered, bruised but never unbowed. He is an extensive world

traveller (on a

"shoestring budget") and failed professional emigrater who has

spent most of his life's

savings on airfares. He is still 'sliding down the razor blade of

life' on the beautiful

undiscovered island that is New Zealand, somewhere near the bottom

(rude!) of the world near Antarctica. There he talks to the 60 million sheep!</P>



<P>Craig has been involved in the corporate world (life assurance) for

over

twenty years in

South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.

However, through a strange set of circumstances and finding himself

in a

small town

near the bottom of the world ...and with nothing else to do, he

started

writing. </P>



<P>That was five years ago. Five published books later and having

written

another

fourteen manuscripts (on widely differing subjects) being published

and

promoted

himself on the internet... this is where Craig is in the

"journey/adventure" that is life.</P>

<P>

Craig has taught at the local Tairiwhiti Polytechnic (English), as

well

as running a

successful creative writing course (not teaching sheep!). He is the

author of (as far as

we know) the first and only creative writing course on the internet

by a

published

writer. Craig has many varied interests and passions. He is

particularly

interested in the

field of psychology and what makes different people "tick-tock

grandfather clock".

One of his missions in life is helping people make the most of

their

hidden potential and

so finding their niche in life... so that they are happy.</P>



<P>He firmly believes in the motto: "Find what you love doing, then

you

will never have to

do a day's work in your life."</P>



<P>Craig is certain he has found his niche in life... anyway, what

other

job would be

suitable for him?</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#B70000" SIZE="-1">was born in 1970 in Glasgow, Scotland. His mother was a
 huge
 Slade fan,
 and dressed the fledgling Logan in platform booties and spangly diapers.
 
 Only the advent
 of Punk Rock saved him from a childhood of silver jumpsuits and glued-on
 
 sideburns.
 
 His adult life has been plagued by unfair comparisons to Tin-Tin and
 Jimmy
 Somerville, brought
 on by his ginger hair. Now that it is beginning to fall out, he is
 almost
 relieved.
 
 Michael has written several pieces of short fiction. They are all, bar
 the
 story on this site, orbiting
 around editor's desks across Scotland. His first novel, The Lonely
 Season,
 is being perused by an
 interested agent.
 
 Michael lives in Glasgow with Natasha, and Kyle the rabbit. His
 favourite
 hobbies are fencing and
 laughing demonically at inappropriate moments, a practice which will no
 doubt get him fired from his
 day job as an Engineer.<BR>

I write poetry with the viewpoint of the ancient world in both my heart and mind. My chosen

mindset is that of the Goddess-based cultures of the Bronze Age to the Iron Age world of the

Indo-European Celts. My poetry is intended for all those who look to Mother Earth and Sister

Sky for inspiration regardless of their spiritual bent. As far as my fiction writing goes, it

is everywhere. From humorous science fiction and horror to serious action/adventure and 

fantasy. I have just started to dabble in mystery fiction. There are too many muses to ignore.

Finding the time to appease them all can be an arduous task. I am mostly Celt by blood and by

creed. My family is of both Scottish/Pictish and Breton stock. I am supposed to have this

crazy uncle who was born on the Isle of Man and had his ear torn off in a pub fight in

London, but I have yet to verify this. My family also has a smidgen of Welsh and a

touch of German in us as well. To all my Welsh soulmates out there, "Ysdryd Tracwyddol 

y Keltiad Yddraic Coch Ddyrg Cychwyn!" I am a member of the Academy of American Poets, the

Science Fiction Poetry Association, the British Science Fiction Association, the National

Writers Association, the Horror Writers Association and the Science Fiction Club Deutschland.

I have had 84 short stories and poems published in 17 countries and translated into 12

languages. Publication credits include: <U>Vermont Living Magazine</U>, <U>The Zone</U> (United Kingdom), <U>Antipodean Science Fiction</U> (Australia),
