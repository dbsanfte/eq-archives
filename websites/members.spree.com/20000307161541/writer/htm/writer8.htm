How To Quote Others</b><BR><BR>

<font size=4>The art of quoting is tricky business. <br><BR> <font size=4>
While plagiarism suits are rare, they always make
headlines, and strike fear in the hearts of writers. Most writers are extremely careful
and accurate in reporting the sources they borrow from. But there are also a lot of
questions regarding circumstances and rights when quoting. Even experienced
authors don’t always know all the answers. Below are some  specific points
that will help protect authors.<br><br><img src="/writer/jpg/nativebar4.jpg"><br><BR>



<font size=4><font color="#0000ee">
<img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif"> WHAT IS FAIR USE?<font size=3><br><br>

Fair use is detailed in the Copyright Act - although anytime we are dealing with
“Intellectual property” rules and guidelines are very esoteric. The Copyright Act says
that 4 things need to be considered in determining what is and is not fair use.
<br>
a. The amount of the work you use from another source in relation to the entire length
of the original material from the source.
<br>
b. The nature, purpose, and character of the use.
<br>
c. The nature of the original copyrighted work.
<br>
d. The effect of the use on the value and marketability of the original work.
<br>
Interpretation of these guidelines is left up to the individual court which tries the case,
and as such there are no more well defined judgments to these guidelines. Although,
most editors and publishing houses have their own set of rules when it comes to fair
use. They have the money to afford the best intellectual property attorneys in the
business, and will generally prevent an author from stepping over the lines. A very
general rule is that if you’re using less than 75 - 100 words from the original source
then you’re safe.<br><BR>

<br><br> <font size=4><font color="#8b0000">
<img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif"> DIRECT VS. INDIRECT QUOTES
<br><br> <font size=3>
If you paraphrase the original material, i.e. shorten it, rearrange it, lengthen it, rewrite it
to make your point, etc. you are using an indirect quote. The term refers more to the
substance of the material than to the exact words. If you use indirect quotes you have
to be sure that you don’t alter the meaning or intent of the original work.
<br>
A direct quote is exactly what it says it is. If you quote the words of another, verbatim,
no changes, then it is a direct quote.
<br><br><img src="/writer/jpg/nativebar4.jpg"><br><BR>
<font size=4><font color="#1c1c1c">
 <img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif">WHAT IF YOU CAN’T GET PERMISSION FOR USE ?
<font size=3><br><br>
Let’s say you want to write a book regarding alternative medicine, exposing the
“quacks” in the field. Trying to get permission to quote from their books is going to be
virtually impossible - unless they are as crazy as their methods may seem. How do
authors get around this seeming limitation? How are all these expose books on movie
stars written without the author ending up in court? Since the Copyright Act only
protects the exact wording of a passage, you may paraphrase the remarks made by the
writer without express permission. In order to do this you will need to add a footnote to
indicate your source.
<br><br><img src="/writer/jpg/nativebar4.jpg"><br><br>
<font size=4><font color="#00008b">
 <img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif">LETTERS
<br><br><font size=3>
As with other written material, words, thoughts and feelings that are conveyed in
personal letters are the intellectual property of their creator. In order to use these you
must have permission from the person who wrote or sent the letter - not the recipient.
In case of an interview conducted via mail, you’ll need to include a permission form,
authorizing you to use the material from your subject.
<br><br><img src="/writer/jpg/nativebar4.jpg"><br><br><font size=4><font color="#008b00">
<img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif"> CHANGING THE NAME TO PROTECT THE INNOCENT 
<br><br><font size=3>
In this case I am advising you to change the names, descriptions, and location of
characters to protect yourself as the writer. If you are writing a work which contains
both fiction and fact, woven loosely, or even directly around the life of a real person, or
town, - and you can not get the names of all the sources from which you quote, then
this is the safest way to go. Copyright may not be the issue here, but slander and liable
could very easily be indicated in such cases.
<br><br><img src="/writer/jpg/nativebar4.jpg"><br><br>


<font size=4> <font color="#cd0000"><img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif">ELLIPSIS
<br><br><font size=3>
If you edit a direct quote, by omitting some of the original words, you need to indicate
this editing by use of the ellipsis. What is an “ellipsis” ? It is the series of three dots
that you see inside a quote. “I never intended ... well that was not my intention,” said
the ex Vice President.

<font size=4><font color="#8b008b">

<img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif"> GETTING RELEASES
<br><br><font size=3>
Some writers believe that once their manuscript is accepted, the publishers will seek
releases for any copyrighted material contained in the article. While this is true in some
cases, it is not the standard practice. Most publishers feel it is up to the writer. If you
are a beginner, or have never been through this experience, it can cause you to panic,
not knowing where or how to begin the process. 
<br><br>
The most common way to obtain permission is to contact the author of the work
through her publisher. Send a letter requesting reprint rights to the publisher. At that
time the publisher will either handle it, acting for the author, or forward your request to
the author. You will need to make copies of all documents involved in this exchange
and forward a set of them to your publisher. If there are fees required for granting
permission it is advisable not to pay them until your work is actually published. The
reason for this is that after publication you will have more money available to you , and
in the event the editor has cut some of your original material, you won’t be paying for
permission to use something which never appeared in the final version of your work.
<br><br><img src="/writer/jpg/nativebar4.jpg"><BR><BR>
<font size=4><font color="#4a708b">


<img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif"> ANOTHER POINT ABOUT PERMISSION
<BR><BR><font size=3>
Remember that when seeking permission to quote from a copyrighted source, most
publishers and/or authors will want to know the exact content and context in which
their work is appearing. Usually sending them the page preceding and the page
following their quote, along with the page the quotation appears on is sufficient.

<br><BR><img src="/writer/jpg/nativebar4.jpg"><BR><BR>
<font size=4><font color="#8b6914">

<img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif"> WHO PAYS FOR REPRINT PERMISSION ?
<BR><BR><font size=3>
This should be answered in your contract with your publisher. The general manner in
which this handled is that the costs will be shared with the author up to an amount
agreed upon by the publisher, or most often, charged to the author entirely and
deducted from the author’s royalties.
Sometimes, when exercising fair use for example - there are no fees required. In other
cases, the cost of fees varies considerably.
Remember to discuss this issue with your publisher before you sign the contract.
<br><br><img src="/writer/jpg/nativebar4.jpg"><br><br>
<font size=4><font color=#"458b00">

<img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif"> WHAT ABOUT COOKBOOKS AND RECIPES?
<BR><BR><font size=3>
The general rule is that a list of ingredients can not be copyrighted, but the instructions
as to what to do with those ingredients can be. Most recipes from a food company
pamphlet or label are not copyrighted, and generally material in newspapers can not be
copyrighted. The common way of authoring a cookbook is to change or slightly alter
the list of ingredients, and to completely rewrite the instructions.

<br><br><img src="/writer/jpg/nativebar4.jpg"><br><BR>

<font color="#551a8b"><font size=4><img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif"> QUOTES FROM THE BIBLE
<font size=3><BR><BR>
The King James Version of the Bible is in the public domain, making it free game for
your use. Most of the modern translations however, are copyrighted and permission is
needed to quote from these.
<br><br><img src="/writer/jpg/nativebar4.jpg"><BR><BR>


<font color="#458b00"><font size4><img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif"> GOVERNMENT MATERIAL 
<BR><BR><font size=3>
Most material published by the Government Printing Office is in public domain. In a
case where it is copyrighted material, or some copyrighted material is included in a
public domain document - this is usually noted with a copyright notice. You should
always cite the source that you are quoting from - whether or not it is public domain.


<br><BR><img src="/writer/jpg/nativebar4.jpg"><BR><BR><font size=4><font color="#8b0a50">

<img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif"> UNCOPYRIGHTED MAGAZINES
<font size=3><BR><BR>
As a common courtesy to the original author, I would suggest asking permission
before quoting from an uncopyrighted magazine. Legally, this work is in public domain,
and permission is not required by law - unless the author has a copyright notice on the
particular piece you are quoting from.

<br><BR><img src="/writer/jpg/nativebar4.jpg"><BR><BR><font color="#8b4513"><font size=4>

<img src="/writer/gif/redtail.gif"> QUOTING YOURSELF
<br><BR> <font size=3>
If you quote briefly from a work you previously published, then you’re safe. If,
however, you intend to quote a complete passage, or several hundred words, from
your previous work you will need to get permission from the publisher.
