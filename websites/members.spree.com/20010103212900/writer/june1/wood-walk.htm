Where shall the word be found, where will the word
Resound? Not here, there is not enough silence
Not on the sea or on the islands, not
On the mainland, in the desert or the rain land,
For those who walk in darkness
Both in the day time and in the night time
The right time and the right place are not here
No place of grace for those who avoid the face
No time to rejoice for those who walk among noise
and deny the voice.

<P>	
Andy snapped on the lamp in his basement bedroom.  It was noon on his alarm 

clock, but there were no windows down here, and light was something made up until he 

went upstairs looking for it.  His father was already at the church.   A prescription note on 

the kitchen table from his mother said she'd need a ride home from the hospital at seven.  

Would someone come to get her after work?  Her husband probably would.</P>

	<P>The coffee was still on, and he filled a cup and channel-surfed the TV till the 

soaps came on.  Then he took a shower until the hot water ran out, and he went back 

down to the basement to get dressed.  Light from the lamp on the nightstand cast shadows 

on the green cinderblock walls where old posters his little brother left behind were 

beginning to peel, posters of Eighties' pop groups like the Culture Club, INXS, and the 
      
 Human League.  Their bright smiles and pastel clothes made Andy wistful for the 

Eighties, back when he was still in school and not worried about the world. </P>   

  	<P>The vinyl tile floor was cold on his feet as he walked through the shadows.  He 

searched through his deal dresser for some clothes.  Although the dresser had a mirror 

mount, he had taken the mirror down and stored it out back in the shed.  Balding and 
      
beer-bloated at thirty, he couldn't look himself in the face.  </P>

<P>He squeezed into an old pair of his brother's blue jeans and pulled on a red t-shirt. 

Then he folded up his bed into the couch and plopped down on the cushions to tie his 

tennis shoes. </P> 

<P>	Halting at the foot of the stairs, he took one last look at his room, this hovel from 

which his brother had been fortunate enough to escape.  A popular radio station up in 

Huntington paid Tommy good money to be a personality to commuters on I-64.  The 

clock on the nightstand said almost two.  It would tick on without him until some 

thunderstorm left it blinking from brain damage.  The couch wouldn't need him either.  It 

was ready to die alone and in peace.  </P>

<P>Though the shadows on the walls beckoned him to stay, Andy was tired of their 

secret society.  He knew there had to be a light somewhere that would never go out, 

leading the way out of West Virginia to something better; an inner light, perhaps, the one 

the Quakers spoke about, an inextinguishable flame that would flicker, blaze, and 

illuminate.  Although he didn't know where to look for that light, he knew he had to find 

it on his own and that darkness was a beginning.</P>

<P>	His father had told him that you can't go looking for happiness; happiness comes 

from within.  Once you've found that you can be happy anywhere.  Andy remembered the 

scene at the airport the day he left for California.  He'd hugged his parents good-bye and 

quickly boarded the plane, but when he looked through the portal he saw them standing 

behind the plate-glass window, staring dumbly at the plane and not seeing his waving.  

They seemed homely and displaced in their Sunday best, his father in a purple polyester 

suit and loud tie, his mother in a faded flowered dress that strained against her body, and 

he'd had to look away.  </P>

<P>In California he'd looked outside himself for happiness, but West Virginia was a 

looking in.  That was one of the reasons he'd left L.A., that and the fact he couldn't find 

work after graduation.  But Andy also knew he'd never find happiness in this house, this 

small coal town with smaller minds, this claustrophobic mountain state that seemed to be 

closing in on him ever since he got his termination notice from the community college.  

West Virginia was where people came to hide, and he'd been a hiding ever since he came 

here.  Now all he wanted to do was to leave.</P>

	<P>He switched off the light and went upstairs, and the family of shadows united 

without him.  Although he hadn't packed anything, he had enough money from his last 

paycheck to go somewhere out West.  All he took with him was the letter of termination 

to show his father.  He thought about calling his mother at the hospital.  But she'd be tired 

by now, and he didn't want to hear her voice fail when he told her he was leaving.  On the 

note she'd left he wrote "I love you."  Then he walked out the backdoor and squinted into 

the unaccustomed light of May.   </P>              
<BR><hr><BR>
	<P>Andy drove his brown LTD to his father's church in Logan.  His father had given 

him the car as a college graduation present when he bought a new red Chevy Blazer.  "If 

you can get it to start," he'd told Andy, "it's yours."  Andy had installed a rebuilt 

alternator in it, primed the carburetor, and replaced the sparkplugs.  Then he'd equipped 

the car with retread tires.  It still drank gas like a drunk and had a mind of its own like 

most Fords, but it served its purposes.  The radio and the heat still worked.  The backseat 

was long enough to sleep on, and without rubber seals, the trunk was deep enough to 

house a small family. </P> 

	<P>His father's church was a two-storey, coal-stained brick building in the middle of 

town.  Its Gothic arches, slender spires, and Doric columns intimidated Andy, especially 

since he'd started reserving Sundays for hangovers.  The stained-glass windows were 

protected by safety-glass, and the belfry had been dormant for decades.  A marquee near 

the church entrance read:  GOT A PROBLEM?  GOD IS THE SOLUTION.  The front 

door was locked, so Andy had to go around back and enter through the basement.  </P>  

	<P>He could hear his father rehearsing a sermon in the sanctuary above.  His father 

had been against his decision to go to California to study theatre.  "You can get the same 

kind of education here," he'd told Andy.  "Besides, the performing arts isn't a stable 

career," he'd added, even though the ministry had moved his family from parish to parish, 

forever making strangers of them all.  </P>

<P>But the parishioners never seemed to change.  It was as if there were clones in 

every church.  Old people mostly, their veined, knotted claws clutching the worn backs of 

dark wooden pews.  Blue-haired women without smiles who wore Easter dresses from 

their youth.  Old men in worn polyester suits who stood but never sang, never closed their 

eyes in prayer.  </P>

<P>Or children in bright, sunny clothes, boys strangled by big bow ties and girls in 

short dresses who didn't close their legs during the children's sermon.  They spouted off 

the tales they'd learned in Sunday school that morning about Jesus, that brown-bearded 

white man in the stained-glass window, who told them to turn the other cheek and not to 

cast the first stones.  But like their parents they threw them anyway.  To them Jesus was a 

comic-book character they colored in with crayons, and communion was a snack, a quick 

diversion from his father's recycled sermons of sin and salvation.</P>

	<P>Andy negotiated his way through a maze of fold-out tables and trudged up a flight 

of purple-carpeted stairs to the sanctuary as the volume of his father's voice increased 

with each step.  Thirty years of preaching had given him a voice larger than himself.  

Andy pushed his way through the swinging wooden doors to the sanctuary, and they 

clacked behind him as if he were entering a saloon.</P>  

	<P>Sunlight streaming in colored beams through a stained-glass window lit up Jesus 

like an ember.  The carpet and curtains behind the choir loft were wine-dark.  A large 

gold-plated cross, glowing eerily in the half-light of the church, hung directly over the 

choir loft in front of which the pulpit stood, covered, like the communion altar, in purple 

satin cloths, each emblazoned with the emblem of the cup and the cross.  A terra cotta 

statuette of the Virgin Mary stood lost in her reverent sadness on the pipe organ to the left 

of the pulpit.  The chiascuro of light and shadows brought everything home for Andy 

about the nature of religion -- good and evil, grace and guilt, purgation and salvation, lost 

and found.  </P>

	<P>Although he rehearsed his sermons, Andy's father never used an outline.  He had 

a habit of stepping around the pulpit as a form of direct yet personal address, so it didn't 

take him long to notice his son slouching at the top of the sanctuary.  A tired-looking man 

with a neatly trimmed gray beard and a full head of gray hair, Andy's father was dressed 

in his usual off-beat attire -- a lime-green polyester blazer, a purple shirt with a cartoon-

character tie, a gold-plated pewter necklace, and a pair of blue jeans pulled over a pair of 

cowboy boots.  </P>

<P>Everyone in the community liked Reverend Wendt.  He'd stayed at this church for 

more than ten years now, the longest he'd ever remained anywhere.  He offered free 

counseling in his office and taught part-time at the community college, where his classes 

always filled up with students eager to hear his teachings.  He brought church enrollment 

up, while the number of people attending Andy's performances remained low.  In 

Appalachia there was no competing with God.</P>

	<P>"What is it, son?"  Andy's father descended the steps leading from the pulpit, 

facing his son up the aisle.  When Andy hesitated, he sat on the front right pew and patted 

the space beside him.  Andy handed him the letter of termination and sat on the pew 

across the aisle from him.  His father produced a pair of reading glasses from his blazer 

pocket and situated them on his nose.</P>  

	<P>Andy watched as his father's tired blue eyes moved back and forth behind his 

glasses, trying to make sense of what he was reading.  He read the letter longer than Andy 

had anticipated.  When he finished his face tightened with bewilderment.  Tucking the 

glasses in his shirt pocket, he set the letter down and squinted at Andy.  "What did you 

do?" </P>

	<P>"Why's it always my fault?"  Andy's cheeks began to flush.  "Ever since I was a 

kid it was always my fault."</P>

	<P> "I didn't mean you'd done something wrong."  His father was measuring out his 

words as though he were in a counseling session.  Andy also noticed that his father was 

mirroring his body posture -- hands hugging elbows, right leg crossed over the left.  

"They had to have a reason for firing you."</P>

	<P>"Remember last semester?  The Players wanted to use the auditorium at Southern 

for The Greatest Christmas Pageant Ever."
</P>
	<P>"I thought they only performed in the summer at the park."</P>

	<P>"They still do.  But now they want a year-round season, and they want to use the 

auditorium."</P>

	<P>"Didn't you do a Christmas play?"</P>

	<P>"It conflicted with theirs.  When I wouldn't reschedule Liz went over my head."</P>  

	<P>"And this was enough to lose your job over?"  Andy's father stroked his beard in 

contemplation.</P>

	<P>"I also heard a rumor," Andy added.  "I don't know if it's true yet.  Liz has found 

a full-time artistic director.  Some actress from Phoenix.  As soon as the semester ends 

today the Players intend to use the theatre year-round."</P>

	<P>"But you can't verify that."</P>

	<P>"Why do you never believe me?"</P>

	<P>"I'm not saying that.  I just think you're jumping the gun a little.  There might be a 

way to appeal this."</P>

	<P>"It's too late," Andy said.  "I missed the deadline to file a complaint."
</P>
	<P>Reverend Wendt's eyes gaped.  "Why, son?"  He leaned across the aisle and put 

his hand on Andy's arm.</P>

	<P>"I'm leaving this evening."  </P>

	<P>His father's face dropped.  "Where are you going?"</P>

<P>"I don't know yet.  But I've got to get out of here."</P>

	<P>"Why don't you stay for a while?  Think things through?"</P>

<P>	"I've already made a decision, and I have to live with it."  Andy felt the hot start 

of tears coming, but he fought them back.  He wouldn't give his father another weakness 

to prey on.  "I'm leaving tonight after the nurses' pinning ceremony.  The Dean wants me 

to work the lights."</P>

<P>	"I know," his father said.  "He wants me to give the opening prayer."</P>

	<P>"Reverend Wendt?"  At that moment a sibilant voice called from behind, startling 

both men.  It was one the reverend's elderly women parishioners, hovering in the door- 

way with uncertainty.  "Is this a bad time?"</P>

	<P>"No, not at all.  I'll be right in."  Reverend Wendt's smile seemed stiffed and 

forced.  "Can we talk about this later, son?"</P>

	<P> Andy jerked his arm away.</P>

	<P>"When we have more time," his father tried to reason.  "The ceremony doesn't 

start until seven."</P>

	<P>"That's all right," Andy said as he rose to his feet.  But he didn't leave.  "I think 

you'll find the lighting interesting tonight.  A little gift for the community?"</P>

	<P>As the old woman walked down the aisle, Andy walked up it.  He gave her a curt 

smile as they passed.  She slipped through a wooden door on the right and clicked it shut 

behind her.  </P>

<P>Andy stopped at the exit door to look at his father's bowed back, as though 

the reverend were in prayer.  The lime-green blazer was dark and taut over his sagging 

shoulders, and it was then Andy realized that green was the color of dying.  
</P>
<BR><hr><BR>
<P>	Southern West Virginia Community College was a big brick building with plate-

glass windows that did not open onto the world.  Finding a vacant spot in its limited 

parking area out front was always a chore, except for those evenings when Andy's plays 

were performed.  The President of the college had had faculty parking signs removed, and 

finding a place to park was difficult, as it was that evening when Andy pulled his car into 

the lot to find it filling up with families of the nursing students.  He barely squeezed the 

LTD between two tiny imports and had to suck in his gut to get out the door.</P>

<P>	Inside the main entrance was the school seal, a genie's magic lamp behind which 

two mountains sharply curved, and beneath the seal, in red Gothic lettering, was the 

school's motto:  "Southern:  A Great Place to Start."  The Dean and Liz were mixing with 

families in the lobby.  Small and stoop-shouldered, Liz walked with a wooden cane and 

wore a billowy flowered dress that nearly brushed the parquet floor over her 

Birkenstocks.</P>

<P>	"I'm sorry to hear about your termination," she said with a sheepish grin as 

Andy approached them.  The sweet, sticky pall of Southern Comfort clung to his face like 

a cobweb.</P>

	<P>"Thanks," he said.
</P>
	<P>"What'll you do now?"</P>

<P>	"Oh, I don't know.  I'll find something."</P>

	<P>"I hope so."</P>

	<P>The Dean made to offer his hand then withdrew.  "We're so pleased you've 

decided to work the lights for us, Andy," he said.  His smiled, but his eyes didn't.  

"The nursing faculty is most pleased, as are the President and Vice-President."</P>

	<P>"It's the least I can do," Andy said.  "Seeing as how this is the last event in the 

auditorium this year."  This he directed toward Liz, whose dentured smirk faded.  She 

quickly turned to converse with someone else.</P>

<P>	"Everything's set up."  The Dean glanced over Andy's attire.  He himself had on 

his usual tight-fitting, shiny blue suit, double chins bulging over his starched white shirt 

collar.  A balding man of dubious blonde hair, the Dean sometimes surprised Andy with a 

warm, dimpled smile.  But his eyes, cool and distant behind a pair of round spectacles, 

betrayed whatever emotions, real or imagined, that went through his mind.</P>
<P>
	"You won't even know I'm here."</P>

<P>	"Remember to keep the lights on upstage left."  The Dean liked to show off his 

knowledge of stage directions.  "That's where I'll be sitting with the President and Vice-

President."</P>

	<P>"And my father."</P>

	<P>"Yes, yes.  Dr. Wendt.  So nice of him to offer a prayer for our graduates."</P>
<P>
	At that moment the President and Vice-President pulled up in front in a white 

state car, and the Dean went out to greet them without excusing himself.</P>

	<P>In the lot below, Andy saw his father's red Chevy Blazer, so he went up 

to the light booth. </P>

<P>	The lights were already up in the auditorium, casting shadows on the cream-

colored cinderblock walls, and relatives of the nursing students were filing in, the women 

in long bright dresses with puffed sleeves, the men in dark serge suits, their heads bowed 

and feet shuffling down the brown-carpeted aisles, as though they were entering a church 

they hadn't attended in a while.  The nursing faculty and students, dressed in their angelic 

white uniforms, glowed on the stage below.  The students were seated on bleachers center 

stage, while the faculty sat rigidly in fold-out aluminum chairs stage right.  Plastic roses 

and vines lined the apron of the stage, and a large white arbor, decorated with the same 

plastic plants, dominated the upstage area behind the bleachers.  The somber atmosphere 

reminded Andy of a funeral or a wedding.</P>

<P>	As soon as everyone was properly seated, filling the entire 500-seat capacity, the 

President, decked out in full military regalia from his years in the Air Force, entered from 

the top of the house, followed by the Vice-President and the Dean with Reverend Wendt 

in tow a few paces behind the contingent.  This was Andy's cue to dim the house lights 

and hit the procession with a follow spot.  Although this was no easy feat for one person, 

Andy managed to take the master down with one hand and guide the spotlight with his 

other.  It was a bit sloppy at first.  The spotlight glanced off the epaulet on the President's 

straight right shoulder and struck the far wall.  But with his other hand free now, Andy 

steered the light onto the moving mass of men and opened the lens to include them all.</P>

<P>	As they took the stage, the crowd got to their feet and applauded, and the Dean 

took the podium center stage, waving them down, his feigned smile reigning over the 

audience.  They took their seats, and Andy tightened the spot around the Dean's fat 

cherubic face.</P>

	<P>"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome to Southern West Virginia 

Community College.  Before we get started tonight, Reverend Wendt would like to open 

with a prayer."</P>

<P>	The crowd and the students applauded.  Reverend Wendt approached the podium 

with that humble smile Andy had come to recognize since he was a kid.  The prayer was 

the usual crap, the kind he'd had to sit through every Sunday of his childhood.  Watch 

over these young people.  Help them to administer to the needs of the flock.  Whatever.  

Andy had heard the same prayer so many times that he didn't listen to it anymore.  The 

gold pewter cross around his father's neck glinted in the spotlight, so Andy dimmed the 

intensity a little.  Now it was just a dull piece of metal alloy.  The cartoon characters on 

his tie blurred into obscurity like abstract visions in a dream.</P>

	<P>The President and Vice-President were whispering in each other's ears and 

giggling like himself and Tommy as children in church, while the nursing faculty 

remained rigid in their cold, hard chairs, facing the audience with pride.  Red- and blue-

gelled lights bathed them like sunlight streaming through a stained-glass window.  The 

nursing students leaned forward on the bleachers like a choir about to sing.  Liz's legs 

were crossed in the front row, her chin thrust forward.</P>

	<P>When Andy had entered the auditorium at Southern for the first time, the chalky, 

autumnal smell of dust reminded him of his father's church.  Each space carried with it 

the eternal presence of death.  The stage and the pulpit were synonymous with 

performance.  The only difference was that there were actors onstage for Andy's 

productions, while his father, the lone performer, referred to characters offstage in that 

lofty green room called heaven.</P>

<P>	"'I am the light of the world.'"  Reverend Wendt's arms were stretched out at his 

sides.  His face was turned up, bathed by the light of the stage lamps.  The humble smile 

was effulgent, as though it floated before his face.  "'He that followeth me shall not walk 

in darkness, but shall have the light of life.'"</P>

<P>	Andy threw the master switch, leaving them in darkness.  His father, whose eyes 

had been clenched in prayer, didn't seem to notice.  His church voice droned on as the 

audience started to stir.  Andy thought he heard the Dean say, "That wasn't supposed to 

happen."  The crowd began to mumble and shift.  Chaos broke out as they clambered for 

the exit doors.  Only Reverend Wendt remained undaunted, calling for calm.  No one paid 

him any mind.  </P>

<P>	By the time the first person reached the top of the house, Andy was heading west 

on the interstate.  Dark clouds hovered over the hills like ghosts searching for loved ones.  

Andy kept looking in the rearview mirror to see if he was being followed.  The hills on 

either side of the road seemed to join together behind him.  When he saw his own eyes in 

the mirror, he returned them to the road ahead.  The sky was streaked with pink and 

green, and he went looking for light in the land of darkness that opened up to receive him. </P>
