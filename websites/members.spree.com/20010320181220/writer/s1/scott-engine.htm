<P>	Trust, faith and action go hand in hand against fear, denial and 
stagnation..  Which would you rather shape your life? </P>

<P>As little children learn to speak, they simply speak.  They do not 
become concerned that their sounds are gibberish, gobbledy gook
and make no sense.  Adults delight in each sound.  Never do adults
say, "Hey cut that out! We can't understand you anyway so why
bother?"  Our enthusiastic response inspires language learners to
continue.</P>  

<P>In the famous story, the Little Engine that Could, the hero was an
initially uninspiring little train, who courageously took on a job
that was bigger and more challenging than his norm.  He literally
thought himself over the mountain.  Who can forget the infamous, 
repititious line of that feisty little rail car: "I think I can, I think I
can, I think I can."</P>

<P>He believed he could: he had faith in his ability.  He trusted that 
even when the picture is contrary to his faith and belief, he could
use that faith and belief to overpower the stagnation that is so 
everpresent with fear and denial.  </P>

<P>Can you hear it?  As his wheels start chugging, slowly at first, 
the faith and trust are building.  The motion is starting.  That 
alone begins to nullify the inertia of the fear and denial.</P>

<P>I (pause) think (pause) I (pause) can (pause) I think (pause) I can
(pause). </P> 
<P>
What the Little Engine had to decide was what would continue to
propel him, just as you need to decide what will turn the tide for 
you.</P>
<P>
Is it making lists, putting it in black and white the answer for you?  
Will that make your faith and trust come alive to fuel your action?</P>

<P>Perhaps for you it is talking it out with a group of close friends
and allies, seeking counsel, and hearing from their perspective to
validate your faith and trust and then take action accordingly.</P>
<P>
Another method might be gathering more evidence of others 
successes (perhaps from history or doing a web search).  What 
you learn may give your faith and trust the reasoning to take 
action or it may give you another message, to say try something
else.  The key there is you are taking action, making something
happen that was not happening prior to setting the wheels in 
motion.</P>

<P>The little Engine climbed over the mountain  because he thought 
he could and he took action towards it, whether or not it appeared
possible to the outside world.  He did not allow fear to take root,
creating quicksand in his train- soul. </P>

<P> "Thinking is easy, acting is difficult, and to put one's thoughts
into action is the most difficult thing in the world." are the words
of Johann Wolfgang van Goethe.  How has this statement  been the 
truth in your life?  How come?  And how can being like the Little
Engine make putting your thoughts into action more  easily and
with greater power?</P>

<P>Without action, nothing will happen.  Without momentum, little
will happen.  Without taking the leap, a year from now you will be
where you are now simply with a calendar with a different year 
listed across the top.</P>

<P>In the words of Dale Carnegie, "Action breeds confidence and 
courage. If you want to conquer fear, do not sit home and think
about it. Go out and get busy."</P>

<P>I think I (pause) can.  I think I can. IthinkIcan,IthinkIcan,IthinkIcan.
</P>
<P>You can.</P>
