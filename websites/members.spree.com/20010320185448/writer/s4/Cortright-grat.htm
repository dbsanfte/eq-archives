<P>It’s easy to be grateful when you’re pregnant. The fetus offers
constant reminders of the miracle unraveling inside. My husband
and I saw our next daughter’s teaspoon-sized form on the
ultrasound screen a few weeks ago. We watched her tiny heart
pump blood to her tiny brain and her tiny hands curl up next
to her tiny face. And I am grateful.</P>

<P>Now that I know we’re having a second daughter, I’m even
more grateful for the time I spend with our first daughter,
who is currently obsessed with pennies and Chapstick –
anything she can put in her toddler-size purse. The night
after the ultrasound, I dreamt of leading a line of little
girls, all with their pennies and Chapstick and toddler-size
purses, through a park, down a ski slope, through a mall and
beyond, on into their own lives. And I am grateful.</P>

<P>As I lie in bed staring at the ceiling and feeling sorry
for my insomniac self, the new baby will give me a swift
kick and I am all-at-once grateful for this teaspoon-sized
child with the strength and vigor to kick me in such a way.
I get weepy watching commercials for Toll House Cookies,
and I am grateful for all the memories that haven’t been
created and all the cookies my girls and I haven’t yet
baked.</P>

<P>Pregnancy hormones are no doubt at work here (my “normal”
self can endure a commercial break without shedding tears),
but, for all of us, actively cultivating a sense of
gratitude can help us heal and grow, and this sense of
gratitude will thrive and strengthen when we begin to
pay attention to it in even the smallest ways.</P>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua" COLOR="#7F007F" SIZE="+1">The Importance of Gratitude</FONT>

<P>Gratitude wards off jealousy. When we’re busy aaah-ing
over what we have, we’re not looking at the person
across the street and wanting what she has. Jealousy
has an enormous power to change us, but only if we
let it. By focusing on gratitude, we shift the focus
away from the things we may feel are missing in our
lives.</P>

<P>Gratitude keeps us centered. We’re not panicking over
what we can accomplish but simply basking in the
day-to-day glory of what is. And yet gratitude combines
nicely with ambition, helping us to be gracious to the
people who help us in our achievements.</P>

<P>Gratitude helps us to not complain. Too many of our
conversations, it seems, reduce to a competition of
who has it the worst.</P>

<P>“Oh, I’m so tired. Bethany is teething.”<BR>
“I know. I was up all night finishing a business proposal.”<BR>
“I don’t feel good either.”</P>

<P>We feed off one another until, in our heads, we really
are unhappy.</P>

<P>We often mistake the tremendous power of our words. A
simple negative comment or complaint can damage another
person’s day because it can damage the way they see their
life, either as they compare their life to yours or as
they start focusing on their own negativity.</P>

<P>Don Miguel Ruiz, in The Four Agreements, calls such
negativity "emotional poison." But we can instill more
positive emotions - in ourselves and in others.</P>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua" COLOR="#7F007F" SIZE="+1">Cultivate Gratitude</FONT>

<P>Help yourself cultivate gratitude. Here are a few
little things we can all do every day.</P>

<P><U>Choose your friends wisely.</U><BR>
If you want to be more grateful, spend time with
grateful women. Spend time with positive women to
be more positive, joyful women to be more joyful,
critical women to be more critical, irritated women
to be more irritated.</P>

<P>If you strive to be spiritually strong, supportive,
empowering, intelligent, energetic, and positive,
seek those characteristics in others. Help your
friends develop more positive traits by living those
positive traits yourself. Know what kind of friends
will help you nurture your soul, and set out to find
some.</P>
<P>
<U>Help your friends cultivate gratitude.</U><BR>
Before you say anything about a friend’s situation,
remember that everyone’s situation is unique. I’ve
seen it happen to myself and to my friends. They’ll
be perfectly happy until someone tells them they’re
being mistreated. Suddenly, they’re upset. Don’t let
your friends wield such power, and work to not wield
such power yourself.</P>

<P>Day by day, hour by hour, make a goal to stop complaining
about your own lot. Make a pact with your friends
to cut the complaints from your conversations.</P>

<P><U>Give the gift of gratitude to your children.</U><BR>
One of the most lasting contributions we can make to our
children is to help them understand that we don’t
deserve anything and everything just because we live
and breathe. Help them to be satisfied with the
simple things while giving them the innate power
and ability to achieve whatever they want in life
by living in such a way yourself.</P>

<P><U>Say Thank You.</U><BR>
Whom in your life do you appreciate? Let them know,
whether it’s your mom, your kids, your friends, your
husband, your child’s daycare provider or the helpful
woman behind the cosmetics counter.</P>

<P>You don’t have to spout some corny line. A heartfelt
“thank you” often does the trick. Make it a
habit and your attention will suddenly turn to all the
things people do for you. Write thank you notes
regularly - not just after a gift exchange - and be
mindful of all the ways you show your appreciation
by the things you do in return.</P>
<P>
Spend 15 minutes writing a letter to your children.
In this note, tell them how much you love them, why
you're thankful for them, and all the ways they have
enriched your life. This can be something you give
them now or after they have grown.</P>

<P><U>Be mindful of the little things.</U><BR>
Today, strive to be aware of all the aspects of
your personal, professional, and family life for
which you are thankful.</P>

<P>Take a few minutes today to
appreciate nature. Go for a walk and notice only those
things that are beautiful. Whether you focus on the
stars above, a distant mountain range, or the cottonwood
tree in your backyard, try to notice the details. Give thanks
for the beauty that surrounds us.</P>

<P>Oprah Winfrey and Sarah Ban Breathnach, author of Simple
Abundance, speak often of the importance of a Gratitude
Journal, in which, at the end of each day, they record five
things that they’re grateful for. Regardless of whether you
record these items, spend some time each day to focus on the
little things in your life that make each day special.
Perhaps it’s your child's toothless grin. A warm home.
Delicious food enjoyed with family.</P>

<P>Together, let’s work on focusing on what we have - not on
what we don’t have - and all the ways we can help one
another have more gratitude for their own lives.</P>
