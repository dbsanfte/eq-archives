<br><br><FONT FACE="Abadi MT Condensed Light" COLOR="#00007F" SIZE="+1">
<P>October 20, 1997 dawned like any other day in the New England
college town where I attended school. As a 30-year-old Literature
major, I was two semesters away from graduation and working on my
first book. What I didn't know was that by the end of the day, my
life would be changed forever.</P>

<P>That night, I went to a seminar on eating disorders. Although I
didn't have an eating disorder, I'd known many people who had
suffered from anorexia or bulimia, and I thought the seminar
might shed some light on what caused these conditions.</P>

<P>The speaker at the seminar began to describe why someone develops
an eating disorder, and said that these individuals are not
merely trying to lose weight or look like a supermodel. Rather,
she described a person who was hypersensitive, felt overly
responsible for everyone else's feelings, and suffered from a
deeply negative self-image. All these factors combined to cause
the person to simply refuse to eat.</P>
<P>
In short, the person wasn't starving herself to lose weight --
but in attempt to "not be here." Her research had also shown that
eight times as many women develop eating disorders as men.</P>


<U>The Moment My Life Changed Forever</U><BR>


<P>After I heard this description, I said to myself, "Wow, that
sounds just like me!" Even though I'd won numerous scholarships,
awards and accolades, I had often wondered what I was doing on
Earth and certainly felt responsible for everyone else's
happiness.</P>

<P>"Why, then," I asked myself, "did I not develop an eating
disorder? And why do eight times as many women develop eating
disorders as men?"</P>
<P>
All of a sudden, I knew the answer to both questions. It was the
moment my life made sense for the first time.</P>
<P>
I suddenly realized that women in Western culture have been told
-- and believe unconsciously -- that their worth or value as a
person comes from their physical appearance. (Notice how this
message is reinforced by an unforgiving media.) At the same time,
men are taught that their worth comes from their material
possessions, status, or level of success. (Neither of these, of
course, is where a person's true worth comes from; it's just
where both sexes have been TOLD their worth comes from.)</P>

<P>In that instant, I realized that rather than starving myself of
food (attacking my physical body), I was starving myself of
*success* -- attacking my _material body_ -- because of this
dangerously negative self-image.</P>

<P>I sat there, stunned, because I realized that I had just
discovered what really causes the so-called "fear of success" and
"self-sabotage." The cause was a condition that no one had ever
identified before, and that therefore didn't even have a name.</P>

<P>I realized that the most accurate name for this condition would
be *success anorexia* -- because rather than not being smart or
talented enough to achieve success, the person is literally
*starving themselves of success.*</P>


<U>"How Do I Know If I'm Starving Myself Of Success?"</U><BR>


<P>Here is a simple way to see if you may be suffering from success
anorexia (starving yourself of success). How many of the
following descriptions you can identify with?</P>
<P>
1. I read lots of self-help books but can't seem to use them to
improve my own life.</P>

<P>2. I'm insecure about money or making much less than I should be
making.</P>

<P>3. I'm in a job that doesn't allow me to express my real talents
or level of true abilities.</P>

<P>4. I expect myself to be perfect all the time.</P>

<P>5. I try to be all things to all people.</P>

<P>6. I find it very easy to start projects and very hard to finish
them.</P>
<P>
7. I feel guilty saying "no" to other people.</P>

<P>8. I'm more comfortable watching others succeed than letting
myself succeed.</P>

<P>9. I usually feel like I'm not doing enough, even when I'm doing
all I can.</P>
<P>
10. I feel responsible for everyone else's feelings.</P>

<P>11. I often let others win, even when I could easily win.</P>

<P>12. I have a very low opinion of myself, even though other people
tell me I'm smart, funny, and capable.</P>

<P>13. I usually settle for crumbs, even though I know I deserve
better.</P>

<P>If you can identify with 6 or more of these warning signs, you
may be at risk for success anorexia.</P>

<P>(By the way, just as many women suffer from success anorexia as
men, because women today are being told that their worth lies not
only in their physical bodies, but also in their level of
success.)</P>

<U>
How To Stop Starving Yourself of Success<BR></U>


<P>In my book _Permission To Succeed: Unlocking The Mystery of
Success Anorexia_, I identify seven steps you can take to reverse
success anorexia and allow yourself to succeed. Here are a few
steps you can begin today:</P>

<U>Step 1. Identify your Loving Mirrors.</U><BR>

<P>A Loving Mirror is someone who can see you for who you really
are, someone who can love and support you unconditionally. While
this may sound "touchy-feely," we all need the loving
encouragement of someone like a coach, teacher, or mentor to
become all we can be.</P>

<P>Make a list of the people in your life who can offer you
unconditional support. If you want free resources to help you
find Loving Mirrors in your life, go to 
www.PermissionToSucceed.com  for more information.</P>


<U>2. Become willing to succeed</U><BR>

<P>Few people realize that what we want is also what we fear. If
you're afraid of success, no matter how many "how-to's" of
success you know, you still won't let yourself succeed.</P>
<P>
How do we overcome this? Do a Ben Franklin on yourself. Whenever
Benjamin Franklin had a difficult decision to make, he would make
a list of the pros and cons of the decision. Do the same thing
with success.</P>

<P>What could possibly be a drawback to succeeding? For one thing,
you may have to face your fear of the unfamiliar or people being
jealous of you. What if people expect you to do and be more than
you think you can?</P>

<P>Get the drawbacks and benefits to success down on paper and you
can finally face and overcome your fears.</P>


<U>3. Establish Goal-Free Zones</U><BR>

<P>Set a time and place where you don't do anything. This is vital,
because many of us are overwhelmed by our "to-do" lists every
day.</P>

<P>In addition, people who starve themselves of success are
literally addicted to goal-setting, and feel incredibly
guilt-tripped if they stop, even for a moment, to take time for
themselves.</P>

<P>I counsel my students to establish Goal-Free Zones, because this
is the only way we can learn that the world won't end if we take
time for ourselves.  Astonishingly, this can be one of the
hardest steps for people to take because of the overwhelming
guilt they feel when they do something "selfish."</P>
<P>
We are victims of circumstances within our control. One of the
greatest realizations of my life was that stopping myself from
success not only wasn't helping others, it was actually hurting
those I care about most. Please don't wait as long as I did. Use
these tools and give yourself permission to succeed.</P>
