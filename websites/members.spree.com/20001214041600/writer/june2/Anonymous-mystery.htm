	<b>
<P>	Weight gain is an indirect result of a lack of one (or more) of the 50 or so vital
     nutrients your body must have to remain healthy.</P>

<P>     How can a lack of vital nutrients cause you to gain weight?</P>

<P>     The reason is that whenever you run low on any vital nutrient, your body naturally triggers hunger in
     order to try to stimulate you to eat food that has some of whatever nutrient it needs. However,
     unless you have some know-how, you will often tend to choose foods that may have only small
     amounts of what you really need - but will usually have large numbers of unneeded Calories in
     addition. These unneeded calories get stored in your fat cells and that obviously makes you fat.
     Then your body again runs low on the nutrient it didn't get much of and the process repeats. This
     slowly increases your weight - until you learn to recognize it and deliberately do things differently.
</P>
   <P>  Calories themselves are, of course, a vital nutrient, but if you are overweight a lack of Calories is
     never what triggers hunger. By definition, your fat itself keeps you from ever running low on
     calories. So the hunger you feel when you are overweight can only be caused by a need for more
     of one of the other vital nutrients.</P>

<P>     The way eliminate this hunger, reverse the process, and lose the weight again is to deliberately
     eat certain concentrated natural foods and supplements that have lots of all the vital nutrients that
     prevent hunger, but which provide only a very few Calories.</P>

   <P>  Doing this allows your body to use its existing fat stores for energy, while giving it no reason to
     trigger the hunger that caused you to eat too many Calories in the first place. And without hunger,
     dieting is both easy and successful.</P>

    <P> What are these vital nutrients that control hunger? And how can you handle them properly?
</P>
  <P>   Even though "50 vital nutrients" may sound like a lot, they all fall into just a few easy-to-manage
     categories. These are: vitamins and minerals, amino acids (protein), essential fatty acids,
     carbohydrates, water, and fiber. (We will discuss each of these separately in other articles.)
</P><P>
     The food you eat must routinely provide each of these things in the right amounts because your
     body requires them to stay healthy. That's why whenever it starts to run low on one or more or
     them, it triggers hunger as its signal that it wants you to go get it some more of whichever one it's
     running low on.</P>

  <P>   Obviously, if you don't somehow get what your body needs, your health will deteriorate, then you'll
     get sick, and eventually you'll die. But first your body will probably stimulate you to eat too much
     food with too many calories and get fat.</P>

   <P>  It is not difficult to learn what concentrated natural foods and supplements will give you enough of
     all these vital nutrients without giving you many Calories. This makes it easy to stay on a diet
     losing weight.</P>
<P>
     Fortunately, modern societies also make both the information and the foods you'll need readily
     and cheaply available.</P>

   <P>  For example, eating very lean fish, chicken, or beef provides all the amino acids (protein) you
     need with very few additional Calories. About 12 oz per day is usually about the right amount of
     lean meat when dieting to prevent the hunger caused by too little protein.</P>

    <P> Safflower oil and flaxseed oil are concentrated sources of the two essential fatty acids (EFAs).
     About one tablespoon of safflower oil and one teaspoon of flaxseed oil per day provide about the
     right amounts of these two EFAs to keep your body from running low on them and triggering
     hunger because of this.</P>

    <P> Vitamin and mineral supplements obviously provide no Calories at all so you can use these to
     make sure your body doesn't trigger hunger by running low on any of the vitamins or minerals.
     (However, megadoses of supplements are a very bad idea because large doses of some of
     them, particularly potassium, can quickly poison you.)</P>

<P>     The right amounts of the right vegetables will provide both fiber and the small amount of dietary
     carbohydrate that are required to prevent hunger due to a lack of these nutrients.</P>

 <P>    And of course, liquids, especially plain water, are absolutely essential for your body to balance
     everything else. Eight to ten glasses per day are usually about the right amount.</P>

  <P>   Of course, it takes some learning and thinking to work out what you will eat and how you will
     organize this way of eating for your own personal situation. For example, an office worker would
     need to do things very differently than a parent caring for small children all day at home.
</P>
 <P>    The main point is that when you eat the right amounts of the right foods, You can successfully
     restrict calories while still giving your body no reason to trigger the hunger, cravings, and so forth,
     that make losing weight on ordinary diets so unpleasant and difficult.</P>
<P>
     Of course the weight loss process still takes time, because your body only gets rid of fat by
     burning it for energy, and it can only burn so much fat in a day. But eating the right amounts of the
     right things almost always ensures that the process is easy, hunger-free, and ultimately successful.
</P>
     <P>In my next article, we'll begin to discuss the specific nutrients you need to manage and some
     techniques for actually managing them effectively.</P>
