	<FONT FACE="Franklin Gothic Book" COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1"><B>
	<P>I would like to take a minute to talk to you about cigarette smoking. If you are already a smoker, I hope you will consider these facts carefully. If you are not a smoker, I pray that you will be smart enough not to start. Everyone that knows me is aware that I hate cigarettes! You would too if smoking had contributed a major part in bringing about your mother's death long before you were ready to give her up. My mom was a strong woman. She survived seven kids, divorce, remarriage, financial problems, and even a brain tumor!
It was her chain smoking habit that finally caused her death.
</P><P>I have done some research on the harmful effects of smoking which I hope you will think about before lighting up.
</P>
<P>1. According to the <U>The Journal of the American Medical Association</U>, people who smoke are twice as likely to develop cataracts as people who have never smoked! Cataracts are the world's leading cause of blindness. How important is your sight? Think about it.
</P>
<P>2. The nicotine in cigarettes robs oxygen to your skin. This may cause skin problems. Who needs that?
</P>
<P>3. Quitting smoking lowers hormone levels.  High hormone levels can cause existing skin problems to worsen. 
</P>
<P>4. Do you really want your kids to smoke?  The old adage,"Do as I say, not as I do," is pretty hypocritical, don't you think? Children tend to do what they see their parents doing as they grow up.  I pity the smoking parent that gets the news that their offspring has lung cancer due to a smoking habit.  How do they ever live with themselves? 
</P>
<P>5. Second-hand smoke is almost as bad as smoking itself.  Recent studies have shown that children that grow up in homes where parents smoke develop allergies, sinus infections, and breathing problems much more frequently than those whose parents are smoke-free do.  
</P>
<P>6. Kissing a person that smokes is like licking an ashtray, especially when you don't smoke. Think about the way an ashtray smells. Do you really want your breath to emulate that? How romantic!
</P>
<P>7. Smokers smell like smoke.  Their hair, clothing, cars, and homes usually smell musty. If you smoke, you may not notice it.  I am a first grade teacher and I can tell you which of my students have smokers in their homes and which do not without anyone saying a word!
</P>
<P>8. Smoking dulls your taste buds.  If you think chocolate ice cream, grilled steaks, and lobster bisque is good now, imagine what food will taste like when you can really taste it! Yum!
</P>
<P>9. Smoking is becoming illegal.  Many businesses and restaurants are putting up "smoke-free" signs. One of the major cruise ships is even banning smoking! 
</P>
<P>10. Smoking is expensive. If you don't care about all the other stuff mentioned, I know one thing that you will have to care about-money. Just consider how much money you spend on those little sticks that control your life.  What could you be using all that money for? Think of all the possibilities and get a patch, get a prescription, chew gum, or quit cold turkey! Your wallet will thank you! Who knows? Maybe you could save enough money to reward yourself with a well-deserved cruise!
</P>
