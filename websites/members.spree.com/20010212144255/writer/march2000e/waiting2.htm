	Now,  wind howling,  Ricky checked his watch, slurped his coffee, and stared out the dirty window.  It was getting on towards three and there was no sign of Laura.     Ricky felt his stomach tense and go hard, like it had done when he had gone in shock years ago following a car accident.  He sensed  that  something was waiting outside to consume him.
	<P align=justify>According to the plan,  Laura had agreed to meet Ricky at Red Dingo's at ten o'clock earlier that night.  Then Laura and Rick would drive to Salt Lake City, board a plane for Lima, where they knew they were destined to begin life over again as one of the slightly wealthy.  
<P align=justify>Ricky  wondered if everything had gone all right with the exchange, if Rupert Grange had met Laura, his daughter,  and the men at the rendezvous.  Peering through the dirty window and looking for the full moon, he assured himself that everything was fine, that Laura surely had  gotten a late start, but fear grew in his gut like a cancer.  	
<BR><P align=justify>
	It was an hour later, after six more cups of the bitter coffee, that Laura's black Mercedes pulled into the far end of the  parking lot, stopping  in the circle of light cast by the huge "Eat Here" sign that hung suspended over Red Dingo's.  The driver--Ricky could barely make out a silhouette-- turned off the lights. Though the darkness and wind, Ricky watched the car, felt deeply chilled, waited for the door to open, looked for Laura to step out and walk towards him. 
<P align=justify>	After fifteen minutes, the night growing darker, Ricky  could no longer make out a silhouette behind the wheel.   Surely, Ricky told himself, Laura would have gotten out by now.  Nonetheless, stomach in knots, Ricky  watched, never touching his coffee, as fifteen minutes stretched into a half hour, then into an hour.  At one point,     he saw the inside lights of the Mercedes flicker on, then off, then on, then off.     He couldn't be sure of what he'd just seen,    and then figured that someone had either gotten out of the car or  turned the inside light on.  Ricky felt his whole body grow cold.  
<P align=justify>	 Minutes later, finding strength, Ricky nervously pushed himself away from the table, stood, muttered to no one in particular that he would be right back, and walked to the door. His legs felt numb; his head felt delirious. As he opened the door and stepped  outside, he glanced at the car, perched on the edge of  darkness, and began a slow mechanical walk through the icy wind.  	
<P align=justify>	When Ricky reached the car, buffeted by wind, the world went pitch black,   and suddenly he was  walking through a dark sandy soup. He struggled  to move to the Mercedes, groping for something like a child locked in a dark closet, the car now barely visible  three feet in front of him.
<P align=justify>	Staggered  by wind, sand lashing his face, he peered in through the front windshield.  It was so dark inside that he could make out nothing. What in the hell is going on? Ricky wondered; You just don't leave a car like this in the middle of the fucking desert. Car can't drive itself.  "Laura!!" he bellowed through the windshield.  "Laura!! Laura!.  You in there?  You in there, honey?" He banged with his fist on the windshield.
<P align=justify>	Sick with panic, Ricky circled the car, crazily, circled it time and again, thinking, finally deciding to brave a look in the back seat.   In the growing darkness, he opened the back door behind the passenger seat, leaned in to look,  and  in the small light provided could see that  Laura's back seat was cluttered with books: Dante's Inferno, Milton's Paradise Lost, and Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow were three titles he recognized. 
<P align=justify>	Just then, the wind died, the air cleared, and the moon blazed  over the Nevada desert.  Ricky continued to stare into the back seat and finally at the floor between the front and back seat, knew   something was not right.   
<P align=justify>	Then  Ricky's blood froze and a gigantic lump formed in his throat as he looked at the old army blanket Laura usually kept in the trunk.   He noticed that the contours of the blanket suggested that it was covering something large. He saw large dark stains on the blanket and knew what they had to be.   
<P align=justify>	 Ricky breathed deeply,  ran his hands through his dirty disheveled hair, and reached out and grabbed the edge of the blanket. His hands shook and he knew he was going to retch. Slowly,   pulling the blanket in his direction, he first saw the head, then the body, then the legs.  
<P align=justify>	Completely nude,  arms at her sides, Laura looked peaceful, like a child at rest, and Ricky was tempted to shake the body awake when saw he the small burnt hole just above her left temple. But something else is wrong, Ricky thought.  His eyes running the length of her body again and again, Ricky finally noted  that Laura's hands and feet had been severed, arms and legs now bloody stumps,  and he wondered, crazily, if he should get sick, asked himself what kind of person would do this.     He felt waves of burning ice flow around him and through him, suddenly knew the irrefutable existence of evil,  then vomited onto the books in the back seat as his attention was pulled back to the mutilated corpse.
<P align=justify>	Trembling, Ricky hung over the seat, looking at the corpse, felt overwhelmed by the thickly metallic smell of blood.  Suddenly,  furious winds again rocked the car, and he began wondering if he were dreaming,   assuring himself that what he had seen could not be real. 
<P align=justify>	He had no thought of what to do next and stepping out of   and  moving away from the car, he  stood and felt the deep burning freeze grip his body. It was like being struck in the kidneys by something invisible.  Ricky knew intuitively that something wicked was coming his way.  He knew instantly that he was being watched. Someone or something was watching him, getting ready to prey on him.    
<P align=justify>	 Ricky stood  in the dark cold wind and for fifteen minutes scanned the parking lot and adjacent desert.  He could see no one in the parking lot, illuminated by the sign, the moon and the light inside the restaurant.  When he turned his gaze again to the desert, which stretched into the darkness, he saw nothing, continued to stare, still seeing nothing, and worked on forcing himself  to relax.
<P align=justify>	It was then that, involuntarily, he froze, his head still but eyes darting nervously, looking for  movement in the desert, some shape that he knew had to be there.  He stood and waited,  the icy wind blasting against him, felt the night go completely dark, and then he saw it.  
<P align=justify>	Out of the corner of his right eye,  something moved, a swaying and shifting  in the darkness. It was as if the darkness  were assuming a shape.   He detected movement, almost felt it, a flash, something off to his right,  and slowly moved his head in that direction.  Glaring into the dark,   he could just see maybe one hundred feet away a dark tall shape gliding just over the desert floor. Must be the wind, Ricky thought, heart thumping wildly, knowing it couldn't be the wind. 
<P align=justify>	Light-headed, nauseous, he saw the shape was moving towards him, and then saw the  one shape became two and then three, a black fog breaking into parts.  Jesus, Ricky thought, this is like something out of a nightmare, and he wondered if he were standing on the edge of the abyss Laura always talked about.  Heart thudding in his chest, he momentarily thought of Laura's nude body stuffed between the seats of the Mercedes,  looked at the three,  ethereal shapes approaching him, wondered if he had the strength or courage to run toward the restaurant. 
<P align=justify>	 Searching his mind for a solution,  he heard through the wind the sound of someone whistling a favorite hymn from his childhood, "Amazing Grace."  It was a high-pitched voice that sang the hymn, but Ricky could not identify the voice.  How, Ricky wondered, could anyone whistle in this wind? 
<P align=justify>	Before turning to run, he saw the figures enter the light cast by the restaurant sign, thought he  recognized Jeff and Luke, saw between them a tall fierce-looking emaciated old man that must have been Rupert Grange. Grange appeared to be carrying a long, sharp object; ridiculously, the image of a scythe came to Ricky's mind.  Ricky couldn't be sure. 
<P align=justify>	"Hey, there, spider," said a low booming voice. It  came from one of the men, but he couldn't decide which one.
<P align=justify>	"Hey, little spider," boomed the voice again,  drowning  wind and thought.  Ricky now knew the voice came from the old man in the middle.   
<P align=justify>	"Come here, little spider," said the voice. Listening to the voice, Ricky felt like an insect dangling helplessly over an infinite and eternal pit of darkness. He remembered, suddenly, having read Jonathan Edward's sermon "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" in his American literature class at college.   
<P align=justify>	 Turning, weeping silently, Ricky found he couldn't sprint, and attempting to run in the cold windy darkness began moving in slow motion.  Somehow, his feet seemed stuck in the sand. As hard as he tried to go faster, he couldn't and knew that he was caught in some  web;  he could barely move.  
<P align=justify>	As he struggled forward, winds whipping around him, he opened his mouth and tried to scream.  No sound came out.   He felt the men moving behind him,   realized that  the men's  walk was faster than his run,  prickly chills coursing through his body; he felt the back of his neck seized by a huge hand, felt the hand squeeze  and heard bone and gristle crackle, and felt an explosion of pain in his skull and a ripping of the flesh off his back.  
<P align=justify>It was in the midst of the explosion that he saw Laura Jean standing in a canyon, flames dancing around her, her arms outstretched  ready to receive him.  Falling toward the ground, paralyzed, Ricky Kurtz couldn't decide if  he had been hit  metal object or a bullet or if his neck were broken.   
<P align=justify>	He couldn't tell, consciousness ebbing from him like black tide, and as he fell towards the ground, he felt himself swallowed by an immense and burning darkness, wondered if this were God, thought for a flickering instant of his parents, and floating, the pain  a distant factor now, felt himself sucked from this life.  He wondered if Laura were ready for him, heard crackling flame, and knew  that he would  soon find out.
