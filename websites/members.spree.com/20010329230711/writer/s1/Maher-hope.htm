	<P>Parkinson's affects more than 500,000 Americans, 3% of the population 
over 50, including actor Michael J. Fox and perhaps still the most 
famous athlete in the world, Muhammad Ali. </P>
<P>
According to the Alzheimer's Association, about 4 million Americans have 
Alzheimer's disease and 14 million will have the disease by the middle 
of this century unless a cure or prevention is found! </P>

<P>And approximately 25% of persons over 65 already show signs of senile 
dementia!</P>

<P>While we do not yet fully understand what causes these age-related 
diseases, research from around the world keeps gathering more pieces of 
the puzzle.</P>
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">
Benefits of B Vitamins for Depression and Dementia </FONT><BR>

<P>Researchers from the Sticht Center on Aging in North Carolina say 
deficient amounts of the B Vitamins may lead to depression and dementia 
in the elderly. Their research is presented in a recent issue of the 
American Journal of Psychiatry. </P>

<P>Researchers found disabled women over the age of 65 were twice as likely 
to suffer from depression if they had a vitamin B12 deficiency than 
women who had a sufficient amount of the vitamin. Nearly 30 percent of 
the severely depressed women in the study were vitamin B12 deficient. 
Only 15 percent of the women who were not depressed had the vitamin 
deficiency. Vitamin B-12 (Cyanocobalamin) is linked to the production of 
the vital brain messenger chemical (neurotransmitter) acetylcholine. It 
helps prevent nerve damage and promotes normal nerve growth and 
development. B-12 is of particular importance for the maintenance and 
protection of the fatty sheaths (myelin) that cover and protect nerve 
endings. Marked B-12 deficiency leads to pernicious (deadly) anemia.
</P>
<P>Folic acid, another B Vitamin (B-9), is actually considered a "brain 
food". Yet, it is the most commonly deficient vitamin in most modern 
diets, most especially in the elderly! Deficiency in pregnancy is now 
much publicized as causing birth defects (neural tube defects). 
However, less well recognized is that folate deficiencies can also cause 
depression, probably because B-9 is needed in the maintenance of normal 
serotonin levels, another important "good mood" brain messenger 
chemical. (Young, Canadian Journal of Physiological Pharmacology, July , 
1991.) Indeed, the most popular prescription anti-depressants are 
designed to optimize serotonin levels. As folic acid is also needed for 
energy production and red blood cell formation, deficiencies can also 
cause anemia, fatigue, insomnia, memory problems and even labored 
breathing. </P>
<P>
These two vitamins should always be taken together. Indeed a deficiency 
of any of the B vitamins can cause mental symptoms! </P>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">Mental Abilities Enhanced by Vitamins C and E</FONT> <BR>

<P>Another study done at the University of Hawaii shows vitamins C and E 
may also play an important role in mental health. Their research is 
presented in a recent issue of Nature. Researchers found those men taking 
vitamins C and E appeared to have superior mental abilities to the men in

the study who were not taking vitamins. They say antioxidants, 

like vitamins C and E, can protect the body from free radicals. </P>

<P>Kamal Masaki, M.D., from the University of Hawaii, says, "Antioxidants 
like vitamins E and C may protect against vascular dementia (brain 
damage from compromised blood supply) by limiting the amount of brain 
damage that persists after a stroke." </P>

<P>Vitamin E helps prevent the learning and memory deficits caused by the 
senile plaques (amyloid beta-peptide) in the brains of Alzheimer 
sufferers. Vitamin C levels are depressed in Alzheimer's disease, though 
this is not caused by diet apparently. At least one study shows that 
mega-doses of Vitamin C in the elderly is protective against 
Alzheimer's.(Morris, Alzheimer's and Associated Disorders, Vol. 112, No 
3,pp121-126)
</P>
<P>On the other side of the coin, according to the Dec. 19, 1998 Lancet, 
smoking, which increases free radical levels and oxidative stress (a 
pro-oxidant)and reduces antioxidant levels, may be doubling your chances 
for developing dementia and seriously boosting your chances of 
developing Alzheimer's! </P>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">Exposure to Solvents Is Linked to Parkinson's Risk</FONT><BR>

<P>Parkinson's disease is a slowly progressive neuro-degenerative disease 
caused by the death of a small group of brain cells (the substantia 
nigra) that are intricately involved in the metabolism of the brain 
messenger chemical dopamine and control body movement. Symptoms include 
tremors in arms and legs, rigid "stiff" muscles, slowness of movement, 
weakness and impaired balance. </P>

<P>Jobs involving the use of common solvents hydrocarbon solvents, found in 
common petroleum-based products such as paints and glues, put people at 
risk of developing more severe symptoms of Parkinson's disease earlier 
in life. So reported a new study published in Neurology, the scientific 
journal of the American Academy of Neurology. </P>

<P>The severity of the symptoms was directly related to the amount of 
hydrocarbon exposure experienced. Occupations that accounted for more 
than 90% of the hydrocarbon solvent exposure included petroleum, plastic 
and rubber workers, painters, engine mechanics and lithographers. </P>

<P>It is likely that hydrocarbons cause the release of "free radicals" into 
the blood. Free radicals are unstable molecules that are an important 
factor in many health conditions, including the aging process, and 
probably Parkinson's. The resultant "oxidative stress" literally burns 
out the part of the brain that makes the brain messenger chemical 
(neurotransmitter)dopamine. Antioxidants protect us from excess free 
radicals and oxidative stress. Therefore, just like in Alzheimer's, 
antioxidant supplementation has some role in the prevention and early 
treatment of Parkinson's. </P>

<P>One such antioxidant, Co Q10, has been reported to be of use in early 
Parkinson's by Shultz here in Southern California at UCSD, LaJolla. 
Neurology researchers in Israel found that a special family of 
antioxidants, the thiols alpha lipoic acid and glutathione, were highly 
effective in rescuing brain cells from dopamine-induced death and may 
prove very beneficial for individuals with Parkinson's. <BR>

(Offen, Experimental Neurology, Sept 1996).</P>

<P>Interestingly, a new study, reported in this months issue of the 
Nutritional Science News, says, caffeinated coffee seems to protect 
against Parkinson's. It appears that caffeine increases the level of 
dopamine. It is the pre-mature aging of the part of the brain that makes 
dopamine (the substantia nigra)that results in Parkinson's. Don't forget 
green tea contains both caffeine and poly-phenol antioxidants and is 
likely protective as well, especially if several cups are consumed 
daily.</P>

<P>Green tea is to be even further considered because, unfortunately, 
coffee consumption might increase risk of Alzheimer's. You see, coffee 
increases blood levels of homocysteine, (an amino acid metabolite) the 
levels of which are thought to be directly related to risk of 
Alzheimer's, heart disease and perhaps even cancer. Eating foods high in 
folate (Vitamin B9 or folic acid), like green vegetables and oranges, 
lowers homocysteine. This may be why folic acid blood levels are 
directly related to dementia, heart disease and perhaps even cancer!
</P>
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">Estrogen Protects Older Women Against Cognitive Decline </FONT><BR>

<P>According to the latest research supported by grants from the National 
Institute on Aging, older women with high estrogen levels are less 
likely to suffer cognitive decline and eventual senile dementia. </P>

<P>Women in the study who had the highest free estrogen levels, had a 70 
percent lower risk of cognitive decline compared with the women who had 
the lowest estrogen levels.</P>

<P>Scientist suspect that estrogen in females, and perhaps testosterone in 
males, promotes new nerve cell formation (neurogenesis)</P>

<P>According to Dr. Yaffe, the head researcher from the University of 
California, if women with naturally low estrogen levels can be 
identified by testing, it is possible that they could take estrogen to 
help ward off cognitive decline.</P>

<P>The researchers explained that the new study measured "free estrogen" 
that was free from other proteins, which is the form of the hormone most 
likely to affect the brain.(This testing for "free estradiol" is

via saliva, and is now available OTC and on the internet.)</P>

<P>However, before deciding about hormone replacement therapy women should 
consider other factors, such as evidence that estrogen can reduce the 
risk of osteoporosis and heart disease, but can increase the risk of 
breast cancer.</P> 


<P>It is further theorized that phyto-estrogens from herbs like Black 
Cohosh, and foods like beans and legumes, 
especially soy, and flaxseed may have this nerve stimulatory 
effect as well, though likely less pronounced. </P>

<P>By the way, this new study supports the theory that taking estrogen 
after menopause may help some women avoid Alzheimer's disease. Which 
leads us to our next interesting development.</P>



<br>
<hr>
 (Part 2)<br>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">New Natural Weapons Against Alzheimer's</FONT></P>

<P>Alzheimer's is a neurological disorder characterized by loss of memory 
and progressive decline of cognition. Though its cause is not yet well 
understood, it appears that again oxidative stress from free radicals is 
strongly associated with its development. Therefore, there is much well 
grounded hope that antioxidants may be useful in both treatment and 
prevention. Such a strategy of maximal and multiple antioxidant 
supplementation seems especially warranted in those of us who have a 
genetic history or marker in both parents. Some hopeful antioxidants 
include Vitamin C, E, Alpha Lipoic Acid, and Co Q- 10.</P>
<P>
Antioxidants are probably useful because the brain is so rich in fatty 
acids. Indeed our brains are structurally 60% fat. (Yes, we are all fat 
heads!) And 25% of that fat is in the form of DHA! Fatty acids are 
particularly prone to oxidative destruction. Prasad from the University 
of Kentucky demonstrated significantly decreased brain levels of 
membrane DHA, and other fatty acids in Alzheimer patients compared to 
controls. Therefore a rationale preventive approach is a diet rich in 
DHA, which is mostly found in cold water fish, and abundant in 
antioxidants. These can be further optimized by supplementation. </P>
<P>
As Alzheimer's is characterized by deficiency of the brain messenger 
chemical most involved in memory, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, 
those supplements which optimize acetylcholine levels and metabolism are 
often suggested to at least slow the progression of this most 
frightening disorder. These substances include such esoteric names as 
Huperzine A, N-acetyl-l-carnitine, DMAE, pantothenic acid (Vitamin B5) 
Alpha-GPC, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine, and CDP-choline. 
(See Vol. 3, lesson 2 of the FREE Anti-Aging Course to learn more).</P>
<P>
A new treatment for Alzheimer's disease, using a drug extracted from 
daffodils, is in the final stages of clinical trials. </P>

<P>The promising results mean that a new drug might soon be available to 
sufferers of the debilitating brain disease, which destroys the minds of 
millions of people worldwide. </P>

<P>The National Botanic Garden is apparently so excited by research as the 
above that it has commissioned a study into the use of native plants in 
medicine. Officials there are urging anybody with old herbal remedies to 
get in touch so they can investigate whether other flowers could hold 
secret cures! </P>

<P>Many of the most effective modern drugs are derived from plants, and 
some of our most traditional medicines such as aspirin (derived from a 
chemical found in willow) have herbal origins.</P> 
<P>
The much more well known herb, ginkgo biloba, can aid concentration and 
improve memory, probably by boosting blood flow, oxygen, and glucose to 
the brain. University of North Umbra study showed that ginkgo may help 
to improve attentiveness and reaction times. According to a 1997 article 
in JAMA, gingko may help to fight the early stages of Alzheimer's. This 
may be due in part because Gingko also increases the sensitivity of our 
brain's memory message sites (acetylcholine receptors).</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">High and Low Tech Early Warning Diagnostic Test for Alzheimer's: 
Brain Scans and Scratch and Sniff!</FONT> </P>

<P>Researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles studied 30 
test subjects between the ages of 47 and 82 who had normal scores on 
standard memory tests. They tested each subject for a genetic variant 
known to be associated with Alzheimer's </P>

<P>The subjects were then given a battery of tests that required them to 
memorize and recall unrelated pairs of words while their brains were 
scanned using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The tests were repeated 
on the same subjects two years later. </P>

<P>The study showed that those who possessed the Alzheimer's genetic 
variant had greater blood flow to parts of the brain near the temple and 
forehead, indicating a greater effort was being made to recall the 
information. Researchers suggest the subjects with the Alzheimer's 
variant literally had to work harder to retrieve the information. </P>

<P>Two years later, the subjects with the variant showed a measurable 
decline in memory, though none was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. </P>

<P>The study suggests that MRI has the potential to be a diagnostic tool, 
allowing for early intervention to delay the onset of the disease. 
</P>
<P>Details of the study are available at The New England Journal of 
Medicine. </P>

<P>A simple scratch-and-sniff test might improve the diagnosis of 
Alzheimer's disease among elderly people at risk for the mind-crippling 
illness! </P>

<P>Columbia University psychiatry professor D.P. Devanand says people who 
can't name common smells, but who remain unaware of their inability, 
appear to be most likely to develop the disease. </P>

<P>"The test was meant to be simple," Devanand said. "Most people score 35 
to 40 with no trouble at all." </P>

<P>But of the 19 who had difficulty but weren't aware of their problem, 16 
went on to develop the illness. </P>

<P>"People who did poorly and said they had no problem smelling were 
particularly prone to develop Alzheimer's," Devanand said. The study is 
reported in (Monday's) edition of the American Journal of Psychiatry. 
</P>
<P>"This is the first time that olfactory deficits, accompanied by lack of 
awareness, were shown in a group of people at high risk of developing 
Alzheimer's disease," said E. Kloss, assistant director of the 
Alzheimer's program at the National Institute for Aging. </P>

<P>It has long been known that people with Alzheimer's have an impaired 
sense of smell, she said. </P>

<P>Alzheimer's attacks a region of the brain (known as the 
hippocampus)which plays a key role in memory. The so-called olfactory 
bulb, which is responsible for smell, is nearby, and may be damaged by 
the same processes.</P>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">So What Can We Do Now?</FONT><BR>

<P>Most of the steps involved in maximizing brain anti-aging are steps 
common to any "maximum health-span" and longevity program.</P>

<P>1. As much as possible avoid oxidative stress from smoking, excess 
drinking and exposure to toxic chemicals and pollutants. If the exposure 
to toxins is unavoidable, add a super antioxidant formula like 
Antioxidant Optimizer to your anti-aging supplement program.
</P>
<P>2. Secondly, eat well, including lots of antioxidant rich natural plant 
foods daily and cold water fish and egg yolks several times a week. 
</P>
<P>3. Thirdly, exercise regularly, at least 30 minutes three times a week.
</P>
<P>4. Supplement antioxidants. Generally a mega-multiple like MultiWellness 
is best. Smokers, those with heart disease and those on "statins' to 
lower cholesterol should consider CoQ10. Diabetics would likely do well 
to supplement Alpha Lipoic Acid.</P>

<P>5. Those over 40 should start to consider enhancing Hgh, melatonin (a 
powerful antioxidant in its own right), DHEA and the sex hormones. 
</P>

<P>6. By fifty, start to "feed your head" some of the special herbs and 
nutrients in a comprehensive brain anti-aging formulas containing

several of the above listed nootropics and antioxidants. </P>

<P>7. Those diagnosed to be in the early stages of Parkinson's, Alzheimer's 
or dementia should consider taking all the above, plus 300 mg of 
phosphatidylserine a day. So should those whose both parents 
have a history and/or genetic markers for Alzheimer's. We realize that 
that is more supplements and expense that most people would like to take 
and pay for, but considering the alternative, it just may be the best we 
can do as of present.</P> 

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">Basic Brain Wellness and Longevity Supplement Program</FONT>
<br>
<P>Fortunately, for most of us over 50 the following program is both 
excellent and reasonable, with multiple anti-aging benefits:
</P>
<P>1) A broad spectrum mega multi vitamin/mineral<BR>
2)A human growth hormone secretagogue, and adding DHEA, 
5 to 10 mg a day, and melatonin. .3 to 3 mg a day, by 60
(these can be started earlier if stress and poor sleep, 
respectively,are a factor earlier.) <BR>
3)A multi nootropic formula.</P>

<P>Women would likely do well to add the natural forms of the
sex hormones,progesterone or both estrogen and progesterone.
Men would do well to consider testosterone enhancement via
prescription gels or OTC products that raise testosterone.</P>
