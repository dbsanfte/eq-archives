          Winter has arrived with a vengeance here on Cape Cod... several times in fact! Stuck out into the
          Gulf Stream like America giving the bird to The Canary Islands, Cape Cod seems to catch the edge
          of every storm that roars up the east coast from sunny Havana. If I was Jesse Helms I imagine I
          could find some sort of Commie plot in all this. Being Canadian I put it down to simple positive
          vorticity advection; on steroids.
<P align=justify>
          No sooner had we unwrapped the last Xmas prezzie and pushed back from the dinner table,
          dollops of gravy dotting our collective chins, when the first evil white flakes began to fall. Smiling to
          ourselves, we thanked Mother Nature for giving us a white Christmas after all.

<P align=justify>          By Boxing Day morning (singularly observed by myself) a good 8 inches of the pasty yuck lay in the
          driveway. Ms. M. jr. stood in the farmers porch, nose pasted to the glass, a faraway look in her
          eye. Sanibel or Captiva I suspect. I slunk around the corner of the fridge and stealthily removed the
          coffee carafe from the machine, simultaneously lifting my cup from the counter. Gingerly I began to
          make myself a cup of coffee, careful not to let the rim of the carafe clunk against my cup. The carafe
          replaced soundlessly I gently opened the fridge door for the cream, with my thumb, agonizingly slow
          to avoid the distinctive 'pop' as the gasket released from the frame. So far so good.
<P align=justify>
          In triumph I took a first sip from the cup and quietly backtracked in my footsteps toward the office.
          From the corner of my eye I could see fresh emails stacking up in my Inbox. All the while I kept the
          other eye on Ms. M. jr., steadfastly staring out the window. I had nearly backtracked into the
          office, Myrrh giddily twining through my legs, when Ms. M. jr. spoke.
<P align=justify>
          "The snow shovel is leaning up against the back of the house."

<P align=justify>          I hung my head and padded into the office, taking one more long slurp of coffee before reaching
          under my desk for my boots.
<P align=justify>
          I know it probably sounds distinctly un-Canadian but shovelling snow rates right up there in my
          book; about the same as a root canal without Novocaine or dealing with an ex wife when the
          alimony cheque is late. Give me 12 months of sunny and hot weather and I will be a happy camper.
          I will even take 8; with 2 months of early autumn and 2 of late spring. I'm not picky, honest! But
          leave that yucky white stuff to those who get a rush out of barrelling the ski-doo into the side of a
          black spruce at 50 miles per hour or appreciate the finer points of frostbite. 
<P align=justify>
          Sadly tying my soggy laces I peered over at my toque hanging forlornly off the easy chair in the
          corner. It would be wet inside for sure. Laws Law #287 - If you have to go out in the snow in a
          hurry your toque and mitts will be invariably wet. I grabbed the toque and pulled it down over my
          freshly shaved pate (timing is everything eh?), a single drop of New England winter sliding down the
          back of my left ear. Gloves were next, tossed on the floor to make way for several other peoples
          mitts on the radiator. I grumbled under my breath and jammed them into the sodden pockets of my
          coat.
<P align=justify>
          Squeegee'ing (is that a word?) out the front door I plodded around the house to find the shovel.
          Law's Law #288 - Snow will always be 1 inch deeper than your boots are tall. From time to time I
          lifted a foot and shook a couple of gallons of fresh yuck out of my boots. Finally I found the shovel,
          not at the back of the house, but at the far corner where someone had used it for scooping up
          acorns in the fall. I cursed under my breath... oh wait... nevermind!... and trudged back through the
          snow to the front of the house.
<P align=justify>
          Our driveway here on quaint Dolphin Lane is circular, with a straight section running, tangent to the
          eastern entrance, from the street to the side of the house. Simple logic would be to leave the car
          next to the house and shovel in a straight shot the 40 feet to the street. But we are talking New
          England here, land of the 'why do it the simple way when there is a much harder option'. For most
          of the winter the straight section will remain clogged with snow while it is the 'man's job' to keep the
          circular portion of the drive cleared to gleaming pavement. After my snow clearing I have been
          tempted to paint a center ice logo and hash marks for the goalies crease.
<P align=justify>
          None of our neighbours have circular driveways I have noticed. Perhaps they are from 'somewhere
          else', purchasing their houses based upon the winter logic of places like Erie, Pennsylvania or
          Cleveland, Ohio; places where 18 inch dumps of snow predicate taking a mighty run at the drive
          and pushing like hell until you reach the street. I am certain they must be standing behind the sheers,
          steaming mug of coffee in hand, giggling themselves silly over this Canuck Schmuck across the street
          zooming up and down the drive, shovel flailing and water flying off the top of his soggy toque. I can
          see it in the eyes of the fellow down the street as he races by in his rusty Volvo; the grin, the wink,
          the thumbs up he gives me; just before he turns the wheel into the big puddle and sends another
          torrent of liquid misery my way.
<P align=justify>
          I am quite certain that the fellow who designed my driveway must have studied under the Marquis
          du Sade. Not only do I have the only circular driveway on the street, but eschewing such modern
          marvels as concrete, he created the driveway out of a precisely laid pattern of cracked asphalt and
          boulders. In the summer children will only play in the backyard, fearful of losing an appendage or at
          least a couple inches of kneecap should they stumble. In the winter it becomes my own personal
          hell. Nothing can express the feeling, while getting up a full head of driveway clearing steam to have
          the edge of the shovel suddenly lodge in a crack in the driveway or stop stuck behind the jagged
          edge of one of those knee biting boulders. Several times Matti has had to stop shovelling, rubbing
          her tummy in pain and grousing inside for a coffee and sympathy. Myself being several inches taller,
          the end result is seeing stars and fleeting wonder about ever being able to father children again.
          Heaven help if the youngun ever helped out. I would have a helluva time explaining to his father how
          junior was garrotted by a snow shovel.
<P align=justify>
          At least the weather was warm, perhaps 30 degrees Fahrenheit (yes I have almost totally
          abandoned that silly Celsius system) and sunlight peeped out of the breaks in the stratus. Emulating
          the sound of a snow blower under my breath I began to shovel mightily, sending a plume of snow
          arcing over the driveway into the rhododendrons. In short order the eastern end of the driveway
          began to appear from under the yuck. Soon the car was cleared and I had moved onward, churning
          my way toward the intersection end. I stopped, only for a second, as I sailed past the front door,
          snapping a Winston Light 100 between my teeth in best John Wayne fashion, and flicking my trusty
          Zippo in one motion as I snapped it out of my pocket. By the end of my cigarette I was 3/4's of the
          way around the drive and heading back downhill to the street. I smiled my best Jean Chretien smile
          (this joke will be lost on my American readers... sorry) and stuck my chin out at the snow monster.
          Under my breath I began to sing 'We Shall Overcome'.
<P align=justify>
          Reaching the street, I felt a burst of energy coming on. Not once had I had the crotch rending
          incursion of the shovel handle. Not even a quick fall on my arse rounding the corner by the bird
          feeder. Maybe I had vanquished the snow monster. Flipping the shovel over my shoulder like a
          latter day Paul Bunyan I swaggered up the driveway, tipping the corner of my toque at Ms. M. jr.
          as I passed the farmers porch.
<P align=justify>
          Rounding the corner of the house I looked out over the perfect white expanse of the backyard. Call
          it childishness, call it glee at vanquishing the snow monster... I leaned the shovel up against the house
          and walked out into the middle of the yard. With a whoop I flung myself backwards to make a
          snow angel. I hadn't done this since B was a baby! Only in mid flight did I wonder what might be
          under the snow in this spot...

<P align=justify>          I landed, not with a woosh of powdery snow, but with the crunch of breaking pottery. I tucked my
          widespread arms back to my sides and pushed myself upwards to a sitting position, turning slowly in
          fear of what I had landed on. There, pasted to the ground, with visible impact marks all around, was
          the remains of the large garden frog that had sat silently thrumming in the middle of the yard for the
          past two years. One ceramic eye looked up at me in horror, his 'leapers' pulverized into the
          remnants of the lawn.
<P align=justify>
          Springing to my feet I retrieved the shovel and began to smoothe the snow... Maybe by next spring
          I will have created a plausible alibi...
