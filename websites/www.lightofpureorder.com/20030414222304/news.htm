&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What a month it has been behind the
scenes! The guild finally has a graphics artist for the site. Are you tired of
looking at just blue and white, every where you go on the site? I know I am.
Meetings are taking place, work is being done, and a graphic design is being
made for our site. The new site is really getting interesting now. There is
still a lot of work to be done behind the scenes, but I'm not going to give up
on the updates. Check back often for events, info, and other news for the guild.
Site is still being updated, and I'm not sure what all has to be updated for the
weekend, still receiving emails and such.&nbsp;</font></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guild is once again accepting
applications for members and officer's to post their character information on
the site. As character information comes in, it will be placed into the guild's
Chain of Command for each section. There is a chain of command for the overall
guild, as well as one for casters and the melee classes. The information
applications have been adapted to also add an area for a member to put a
background for their character. I would like for members to also email a picture
of their character to be on the site as well. All this information will be added
as a Stats screen for the guild in the upcoming new site for the guild. Also,
Strave has been working hard as one of the guild's newest bankers, and has
raised the guild's account to 715 plat. That is an increase of 515 in only three
days!! Please give him your thanks for helping raise the bank in such short
time. Also, I would like for each and every member of the guild to consider a
PvP tournament for all guild members of all levels and let us find out who is
the best of the best. To everyone out there, Safe Journey to all, and keep up
the good fight.</font></p>

Not much news to post, but a few items I wanted to make guild members aware of.
There is a lot of construction on this page and if a part of this site is not
working for you, that is probably the reason. I am in the process of re-vamping
the whole site, adding a lot of new content, as well as specialized pages for
different aspects of the Guild. There is going to be a lot of changes here, and
I hope it is for the best. I encourage everyone to submit pictures, notes,
comments, and other suggestions about the site to me by <a href="mailto:guildleader@lightofpureorder.com">email</a>.
Also, I would like to remind everyone that there are three events this weekend.
A meeting for all officers is being held outside Freeport's West Gate. A raid is
being held in Split-paw Lair. And there is a recruiting event scheduled in
Greater Faydark on Sunday. I have received a lot of emails saying that members
cannot make it to the event on Sunday, and I would like to clear up the
misunderstanding. Members of the guild do not have to attend the Recruitment
events. They are events to help spread the Guild's name thru the populace of
Norrath and to make us better known to everyone. It also has the hopes of
recruiting a few good leveled characters into the guild, and making us stronger.
Hope everyone has a great weekend, and a Safe Journey on EQ.</font></p>

There has been a little activity behind the scenes lately, but large results are
expected for the Guild. Daemc is searching for sponsors for the Guild to help
maintain the cost for the website, plat for the bank, and hopefully soon, we can
add a PL service to Guild members only. Masternifernus [sic] was appointed as an
Officer some time ago, and I failed to inform everyone. He is stepping up to
fill in as a Raid Officer, giving the guild two raid officers to plan and
promote guild events. He has worked behind the scenes to bring a raid for
mid-level characters set for this weekend, and is also planning a low-level raid
for younger members. If you see him online, please take the time to thank him
for his contribution to the guild. There is also a lot of talk about power
leveling sessions and such happening in the guild lately, and with plans being
made for a PL service, I am revising the rules about PL in the rules page,
please check to see what changes are being made to the guild.&nbsp;The member's
page now only list Officers, and their information. The reason for this change
is because there are too many regular members to keep up with. Hopefully soon,
this will serve as a way for members to contact the appropriate officers for
their needs.</font></p>

A few news updates for the moment, the guild event for next Saturday, March
15th, has been canceled, due to my military unit having training. Sorry guys, I
really had no clue that it was changed. It was supposed to be this weekend.
Another good bit of information, there were three new officers appointed last
night. All three have accepted seats on the guild's High Council. Kloude, Strave,
and Fuegan were the three appointed last night, be sure to congratulate them.
The guild's bank account has dropped to only 500 plat total, but some good items
were gained from a member, please help donate to bring the guild bank account
up. Remember, all money and items being held by the guild banker, Raajah, is for
the bank. It is totally separate from Raajah's personal money and items (only
250plat). Hope everyone has a safe weekend, and a wonderful adventure on EQ this
weekend.</font></p>
