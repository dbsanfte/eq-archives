Conduct</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="4">There are
not many societies that can survive without some form of rules and codes of
conduct to keep justice and peace. I wish there was some way to keep from having
to make rules for the guild, but there isn't. SO, without further notice, here
are the rules set forth for the guild, Light of Pure Order. These rules are
subject to be changed and revised as seen fit by the officers of the guild.</font></p>
<p align="center"><a href="#Guild Rules:"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="4">Guild
Rules </font></a> <font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="4"> | <a href="#Officer Rules:">Officer Rules</a> </font></p>
<p align="left"><a name="Guild Rules:"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="4">Guild
Rules:</font></a></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="4">&nbsp;1.&nbsp; There is to be no begging or bothering of guild members for
equipment, cash, ports, or <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; power leveling in guild chat. If you need a favor,
then you can ask for help, but do not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bother other members in guild chat.<br>
&nbsp;2.&nbsp; Power Leveling is not condoned by the Light of Pure Order. If you
wish to seek someone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to PL you, please do not spam the
guild chat.<br>
&nbsp;3.&nbsp; Finally, all &quot;Play Nicely&quot; Rules and regulations set
forth by Sony and Verant should be <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; followed without a second thought. If
there is something that you don't agree with that <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sony and Verant have ruled against,
leave it as something you don't like. Don't use the <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; guild to try to overthrow the rules.<br>
&nbsp;4.&nbsp; All members should act in ways that will bring only a good
reputation to the guild. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone that sees you, sees the name
of the Guild. Anything you do that is harmful to <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your character's image, is also
harmful to the Guild's image.<br>
&nbsp;5.&nbsp; Guild members must play their guild character once a month. The
guild will remove all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inactive characters on the 15th of
every month. If a character has not been played since<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the 15th of the month before, it will
be removed from the guild, on the spot, no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; questions asked. If you have alt
characters that you do not play much, please be sure&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to mark them, i.e. &lt;Daemc's
Alt&gt; on the guild management window in EQ. Alt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; characters that are marked on the
guild mangement window, are immune to deletion,&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unless the main character has not
been played since the previous deletion.<br>
&nbsp;6.&nbsp; All members are to uphold the decisions of the Officers online.
Anyone that does not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; obey a officer's orders, will be put
on probation until a trial can be held.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;7.&nbsp; The decision made by officers should be final, and should be
obeyed as if they are Law.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you feel that a officer's decision
is wrong, then you may request a trial for the decision&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the High Council.</font></p>
<p align="left"><a name="Officer Rules:"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="4">Officer
Rules:</font></a></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="4">&nbsp;1.&nbsp;
No Officer will abuse their power.<br>
&nbsp;2.&nbsp; Officers will NOT remove members without giving them a proper
trial.<br>
&nbsp;3.&nbsp; If there is a problem within the guild, Officers have to do what
is needed, to solve the&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; problem.<br>
&nbsp;4.&nbsp; If the officers can't solve the problem at that time, then the
High Council will hold a trial.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="4">All of the
above rules are strictly enforced. Anyone caught breaking the rules will be
given one verbal warning. After a verbal warning has been issued, another
violation of the rules will be removal from the guild. If a member feels that
they are being treated unfairly, then a council of members will meet and discuss
the situation and a decision will be made. The ruling of the council is final
and no one will change what the council decides. Serious violation of the rules
will be subject to notification of a GM for assistance, and possibly, removal of
the violator.</font></p>
