<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="5" color="#FFFFFF">Code of
Conduct</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FFFFFF" size="4">There are
not many societies that can survive without some form of rules and codes of
conduct to keep justice and peace. I wish there was some way to keep from having
to make rules for the guild, but there isn't. SO, without further notice, here
are the rules set forth for the guild, Light of Pure Order. These rules are
subject to be changed and revised as seen fit by the officers of the guild.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FFFFFF" size="4">Guild
Rules:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FFFFFF" size="4">&nbsp;1.&nbsp;
There is to be no profanity in the Guild Chat. Please, there are some minors
that play EQ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and there are even some in the guild.
Please be kind and do not use profanity.<br>
&nbsp;2.&nbsp; There is to be no begging or bothering of guild members for
equipment, cash, ports, or <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; power leveling in guild chat. If you need a favor,
then you can ask for help, but do not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bother other members in guild chat.<br>
&nbsp;3.&nbsp; Power Leveling is not condoned by the Light of Pure Order. If you
wish to seek someone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to PL you, please do not spam the
guild chat.<br>
&nbsp;4.&nbsp; Finally, all &quot;Play Nicely&quot; Rules and regulations set
forth by Sony and Verant should be <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; followed without a second thought. If
there is something that you don't agree with that <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sony and Verant have ruled against,
leave it as something you don't like. Don't use the <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; guild to try to overthrow the rules.<br>
&nbsp;5.&nbsp; All members should act in ways that will bring only a good
reputation to the guild. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone that sees you, sees the name
of the Guild. Anything you do that is harmful to <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your character's image, is also
harmful to the Guild's image.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FFFFFF" size="4">Bank
Rules:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FFFFFF" size="4">&nbsp;1.&nbsp;
All donations are welcome, and are not subject to re-embursment.<br>
&nbsp;2.&nbsp; All items sold to the bank are subject to be sold at anytime
after they become property of&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bank.<br>
&nbsp;3.&nbsp; The bank will not buy any items unless the item has a value of no
less than one platinum.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anything valued less than one plat
will be considered a donation and will not be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; purchased by the bank.<br>
&nbsp;4.&nbsp; Loans are subject to be paid with interest according to the
Interest Rate Chart below.<br>
&nbsp;5.&nbsp; In order to borrow a loan from the bank. An item valued at half
of the loan value must be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; held by the bank. Upon the loan being
paid in full, the item will be returned to the owner.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the loan is not repaid, this item
and the penalty items become property of the bank.<br>
&nbsp;6.&nbsp; The maximum time for a loan is three months. After three months
have passed, if the loan<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cannot be paid, then an item or items
of equal value to half the loan must be paid to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bank at that time. Failure to payback
the guild bank will result in reporting action to a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GM, as well as a guild trial.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FFFFFF" size="4">All of the
above rules are strictly enforced. Anyone caught breaking the rules will be
given one verbal warning. After a verbal warning has been issued, another
violation of the rules will be removal from the guild. If a member feels that
they are being treated unfairly, then a council of members will meet and discuss
the situation and a decision will be made. The ruling of the council is final
and no one will change what the council decides. Serious violation of the rules
will be subject to notification of a GM for assistance, and possibly, removal of
the violator.</font></p>
