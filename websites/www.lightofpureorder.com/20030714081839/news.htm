&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The meeting last night wasn't that
productive, but I did get some feedback from guild members on the guild. There
was only one winner in the recruitment contest. Kyline recruited 15 members into
the Light, and received first place in the contest. The prize money for second
and third place will go into the guild's bank account to help fund future
events. The guild would like to thank Fuegan for his contribution to the guild
bank, that allowed such prizes as the award money to be possible. Other members
are encouraged to also help build the guild's bank account so that there will be
money for future events. Please check the events page for information on a new
event posted. The guild will be having it's Summer Cookout this Wed. July 9th,
at 7:30 pm EST. Just to let everyone know, the reason that guild membership
pages are not being updated, is because the guild's management window is bugged.
There are a few members that are showing incorrect levels. It also records the
incorrect information when it is dumped to a text file for update. Hopefully,
Sony will get this problem fixed soon. Until then, please submit member
applications with the correct information, and I will update as much as
possible. Thanks for understanding everyone.</font></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just want to take a moment and
remind all that are participating in this weeks recruitment contest, that they
must email the names of the members they recruit before the guild meeting on
Saturday. The contest will end on Saturday, and the winners will be awarded at
the guild meeting. Everyone is encouraged to attend this meeting, but it is a mandatory
meeting for Officers. The details are listed on the events page.</font></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to a few emails, I will
answer the question as to why we are starting to recruit for the guild once
again. I have received numerous messages and complaints that there isn't enough
active members online at various times. The only idea that I have to solve this,
is to recruit more active players. I want this guild to become one &quot;very
large&quot; family once again, but also, I would like for us to start coming up
with a purpose for our guild. Some reason to stand out among the rest of the
guilds in Norrath. I am not wanting this guild to grow too large, too fast, but
rather a small contest to see how large we can become for this moment. After the
contest is over, then we should take time to get to know our new members, work
together on the guild, and figure out what the next step the guild should take
is. If anyone does not like this idea or has other ideas and suggestions, please
let me know. I am always open to ideas and comments from other guild members,
after all, the guild is more than just a few people, it is a whole family.
Please, everyone help make this guild a family again.</font></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to take steps to increase
activity in the guild. Recruitment, raids, events, and even just regular parties
are encouraged. Members are encouraged to obtain Officer status so that they can
participate in next week's contest. Starting on Monday, June 30th, there is a
contest for recruiting members into the guild. This contest will last from June
30th-July 5th. First place will receive 100 plat, second place will receive 75
plat, and third place will receive 50 plat. To have members count toward this,
you must email the name of the members that you recruit between the dates of the
contest.</font></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This guild has reached a very
terrible inactivity status, and my never being online doesn't help. I am online
every other day at least, but there is no one online. We need to change
this...we need to start recruiting and having raids, and events, and other
activities to revive the guild. I know its boring for other players to be in a
guild that is not active, its boring to me too, but we all have to work together
to make the LoPO Guild experience better than it ever has been. Please send <a href="mailto:guildleader@lightofpureorder.com">me
some feedback</a> and let me know what other members think. I really need to
hear from other members, because I am starting to wonder if anyone besides
myself cares about this guild.</font></p>
