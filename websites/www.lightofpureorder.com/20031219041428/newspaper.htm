&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Ever wonder why it snows in
some zones, rains in other zones, and some zones have no weather at all? How
come there isn't a sandstorm in Oasis, or the Northern and Southern Deserts of
Ro?&quot;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">New Leadership Needed?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">I've gotten several
different forms of feedback suggesting that the guild receive a new leadership
matrix, with new officers, new positions, and a new leader. I agree with ever
single point that was made by these comments and emails, and is the reason I
will be asking the guild to start working on deciding who they want as their
leadership. The following positions are Ideal Officer Positions that need people
nominated:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Guild Leader<br>
Assistant Guild Leader (Good)<br>
Assistant Guild Leader (Evil)<br>
Raid Officer (Good)<br>
Raid Officer (Evil)<br>
High Council Members<br>
Webmaster - For a new website.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">NOTICE!! NOTICE!!
NOTICE!!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">There are changes to the
Requirements to join the guild. All officers should notice these changes and put
them in effect immediately!!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Many Changes to the Site
and Guild</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">There are a lot of
changes taking place on the guild's website, as well as in the guild itself.
After much consideration, and planning, I've redesigned the Rank Structure that
I was working on for the guild. Planning this out has been difficult due to not
getting everyone's information. The details of the Rank System can be found <a href="rank_system.htm">here</a>.
More work must be done. There are special officer positions that are being
reinstated and open for the taking by officers. Check the member's page to look
over the current changes.</font></p>
