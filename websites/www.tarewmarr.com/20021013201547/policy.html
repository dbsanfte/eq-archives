<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b>Terms of Service: 
  </b>By using Mad2.net's search engine services (&quot;Mad2.net Search Services&quot;), 
  you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions (the &quot;Terms 
  of Service&quot;). </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b>Content Linked 
  to by Mad2.net </b><br>
  The sites displayed as search results or linked to by Mad2.net Search Services 
  are developed by people over whom Mad2.net exercises no control. The search 
  results that appear from Mad2.net's indices are indexed by Mad2.net's automated 
  machinery and computers, and Mad2.net cannot and does not screen the sites before 
  including them in the indices from which such automated search results are gathered. 
  A search using Mad2.net Search Services may produce search results and links 
  to sites that some people find objectionable, inappropriate, or offensive. We 
  cannot guarantee that a Mad2.net search will not locate unintended or objectionable 
  content and assume no responsibility for the content of any site included in 
  any search results or otherwise linked to by the Mad2.net Search Services. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b>Personal Use 
  Only </b><br>
  The Mad2.net Search Services are made available for your personal, non-commercial 
  use only. You may not use the Mad2.net Search Services to sell a product or 
  service, or to increase traffic to your Web site for commercial reasons, such 
  as advertising sales. You may not take the results from a Mad2.net search and 
  reformat and display them, or mirror the Mad2.net home page or results pages 
  on your Web site. You may not &quot;meta-search&quot; Mad2.net. If you want 
  to make commercial use of the Mad2.net Search Services, you must enter into 
  an agreement with Mad2.net to do so in advance. Please contact us for more information. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b>No Automated 
  Querying </b><br>
  You may not send automated queries of any sort to Mad2.net's system without 
  express permission in advance from Mad2.net. Note that &quot;sending automated 
  queries&quot; includes, among other things: <br>
  using any software which sends queries to Mad2.net to determine how a website 
  or webpage &quot;ranks&quot; on Mad2.net for various queries; &quot;meta-searching&quot; 
  Mad2.net; and performing &quot;offline&quot; searches on Mad2.net.</font></p>

  and Conditions and Mad2.net Search Service </b><br>

  without notice, including the right to terminate with or without notice, without 
  liability to you, any other user or any third party. We reserve the right to

  AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. <br>
  <br>
  Without limiting the foregoing, under no circumstances shall Mad2.net be held 
  liable for any delay or failure in performance resulting directly or indirectly 
  from acts of nature, forces, or causes beyond its reasonable control, including, 
  without limitation, Internet failures, computer equipment failures, telecommunication 
  equipment failures, other equipment failures, electrical power failures, strikes, 
  labor disputes, riots, insurrections, civil disturbances, shortages of labor

  <br>
  Mad2.net's indices consist of information that has been identified, indexed 
  and compiled through an automated process with no advance review by human beings. 
  Given the enormous volume of web site information added, deleted, and changed 
  on a frequent basis, Mad2.net cannot and does not screen anything made available 
  through its indices. For each web site reflected in Mad2.net's indices, if either 
  (i) a site owner restricts access to his or her web site or (ii) a site is taken 
  down from the web, then, upon receipt of a request by the site owner or a third 
  party in the second instance, Mad2.net would consider on a case-by-case basis 
  requests to remove the link to that site from its indices. However, if the operator 
  of the site does not take steps to prevent it, the automatic facilities used 
  to create the indices are likely to find that site and index it again in a relatively 
  short amount of time. <br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><br>
  <b>Miscellaneous Provisions</b> <br>
  These Terms of Service will be governed by and construed in accordance with 
  the laws of the State of Washington, without giving effect to its conflict of 
  laws provisions or your actual state or country of residence. If for any reason 
  a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision or portion of the Terms 
  of Service to be unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms of Service will continue 
  in full force and effect. <br>
  These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between the parties with 
  respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and replaces all prior or 
  contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral, regarding such 
  subject matter. Any waiver of any provision of the Terms of Service will be 
  effective only if in writing and signed by Mad2.net. <br>
