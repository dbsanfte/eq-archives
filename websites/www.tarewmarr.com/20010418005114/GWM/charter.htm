Our Vision for the future of the guild is to try and become a closer group of Dwarves, Gnomes &amp; Halflings; to hold guild events that benefit all, and bring glory to the Granite War Machine. I would like to see the guild remain strong and prosper.

<ul>
<li> We are a Dwarf, Gnome &amp; Halfling only guild on the Tarew Marr Server.
<li> We are a small guild that likes to have a lot of fun.
<li> We do drink a lot of ale. (Honey Mead if funds are tight.)
<li> We do partake in drunken brawls from time to time.
<li> We do not have set rules.
<li> We are not a Power Guild!
<li> Our Guild Events usually revolve around copious amounts of drinking.
<li> Our main objective is to help one another out, be it with info or directly.
<li> Our secondary objective is to help those truly in need.
<li> The Guild is based on kindness to others, fellowship, and fun.
<li> Did I mention we drink lots of ale?
</ul>
