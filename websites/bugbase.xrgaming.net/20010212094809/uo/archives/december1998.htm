One spokesman for the Elves had this to say: \"I pay for my own dental work. Which might not be so bad if we were actually paid anything for our work. And sitting in the cold making toys with your teeth chattering adds up to some expensive dental bills. So many of us have caught pneumonia or worse in this cold air that the healers around here are the richest in the realm. And we don't even get a day off when ill! It's always about the toys. Well, we're tired of it! It's time to think of the Elves! Elves! Elves!\" Prancer of the Reindeer had this to say: \"At least the Elves get to work inside. We are kept standing around freezing our tails off. Last year it almost felt like I was everywhere.. standing around for months. Even after Christmas was over. And all those toys! That sleigh isn't exactly easy to pull. Let the Santa pull it himself!\" In response, one of Santa's Helpers replied: \"The Elves and Reindeer get treat as well as anyone else in their field of work. Better even. They are simply ingrates who do not appreciate the security of a good job. Year after year we suffer through shoddily made toys and presents. If they worked as hard as they complained, everyone would be a lot happier.\" Looks like trouble is brewing... </blockquote></p>");</script>

While there are other massively multi-player online games, UO is certainly the most prominent of its type, arguably having one of the highest profiles of any game ever.  It is also a game that evokes highly emotional responses from players, both positive and negative.  I recently had the opportunity to review UO's first year with Producer Rich Vogel.  Since I have never played the game, I asked our ace reporter Arreouw for her help with some background information, and she also jumped in with a couple of questions of her own.  The result is the <a href=\"http://www.vaultnetwork.com/features/interviews/ultima.shtml\" target=\"_top\">following interview</A>.</blockquote>The thing I noticed most (and yes Edwin pointed it out too) was the \"unique names\" mentioned in the interview.

Sure people will create fences with locked down stuff. We can look at ways to deal with it, but all in all the benefits to letting people lock down stuff outweigh the bad things. With the implementation of kick/ban we may not do guard protection. It is up for debate right now. Texas Law gives you the option to attack someone who rushes your private house. I've wanted this since I started playing UO, and I believe in giving players ways to deal with their own problems. As far as it becoming a spider's parlor trick, I'm sure it will be, but people will learn not to just walk into a stranger's house, just like RL.\" <DIV>Faceless - (Crossroads of Britannia, 12/15/98) <P> On other characters on the same account being friends... \"All characters from an account that do not already own a house of their own are automatically friends of houses owned by that account.

<script>message("Update Center Updated", "<p>Here is the latest from the Update Centre<p><blockquote>When the servers come back up for maintenance they will have a mini-update on them. This update gives Guildmasters the ability to move, or teleport, their guildstones once a week. This ability will be permanent. Selecting this option will give the Guildmaster a teleportation stone that they may take to the target house and then use it to teleport the guildstone to that location. As before,guildmembers will not be able to access their guildstone until it has been teleported.<p> We added this ability so that players, who will not be the owner ofthe house where their guildstones are currently, will have the opportunity to move that guildstone to a house of which they have a higher claim, instead of losing access to the guildstone once ownership is implemented. The one guildstone per house rule is still in effect as well as the valid location checks. Valid locations are defined as the inside of a house that you own, which currently is defined by having a key.<p> This update also ensures that teleported guildstones attach correctly to the target house. This means that in any house that currently has more than one guildstone, all guildstones other than the first one placed will automatically start the teleportation process as they violate the one guildstone/house rule. This move does count towards the “one move per week” limitation so choose your destination carefully.<p><b>WARNING</b>: As this ability is limited to once a week, Guildmasters will only be able to move the guildstone ONCE, before ownership goes in. Choose wisely and remember you have to give up claim on one house to get claim on another. Game Masters will not be able to move your guildstones as we have given this ability to you theplayer.<p></blockquote>This is all fine and dandy, but I cannot seem to find the option to create the teleportation stone ...  :P <p>");</script>

<script>message("Idea: Implementation of Unconsciousness", "<p>I've been thinking on this idea for the past week and after a night of drinking, it all finally came together. With a lot of input, things have been updated and seem to be coming to fruition through various reposts.</p><p>The details:<ul><li>Upon hitting -10 to 0 hp, a character is given the option of:<dir><li>Play as a ghost, or<li>Stay with your body unconscious.<dir><i><font size=-1>Note: Damage would have to be modified to where you could take damage up to 10 below your actual hitpoints. You will still fall like normal at 0 hp, more on this later.</font></i></dir></dir><li>Upon choosing to stay unconscious, your corpse will be labelled as \"a corpse of %player_name%\" and a flag will be placed above your head saying [unconscious] and it will be lootable to an extent (only things in your pack *not your armor, etc*).<li>Upon someone using a sword on your body to deal a final blow you are given the option to play as a ghost and your unconscious flag is removed and the corpse stays as it is currently.<dir><font size=-1><i>Note: Players are the only things that can deal this \"death blow\" to kill you off (though they can still knock you down to below -10 hp and render unconsciousness *not* an option).<br><br>Note: This would have to allow looting to be a criminally flaggable (and perhaps permaflagging). An addendum to this would be the implementation of the perma-criminal idea such that it works exactly like murderers work, except for the stat loss I guess. The death blow would be the only time that a person gets a murder count.<br><br>Note: While unconscious, the world would appear grey to the unconscious victim, but disable AllNames for them so they don't know who people are, their speech would still be audible though.</i></font></dir><li>During the time that you are unconscious, you regain hp just as if you were alive.<br><li>Once you reach 5 hp again (from zero) then you can regain consciousness.<li>If you regain consciousness, all the items on your corpse are put in your backpack and the corpse disappears.</ul></p><p>What this will allow for is a use for the healing skill on unconscious bodies to raise them back to consciousness. The spell \"Greater Heal\" could also work, that is up to the dev team.</p><p>How will things change?</p><p>You will still fall (either unconscious or dead) at 0 hp, but if someone hits you with an ebolt while you are at, say, 15 hp, it does 22, then you fall to -7 and are unconscious. You can then decide whether or not to stay with your body as unconscious, or give up life and manifest as a ghost.</p><p>The act of chopping a corpse would do the extra 10 points of damage necessary to kill the player (but must be checked to not be exploitable). This idea could also be used to implement real *meat* to death such as stat loss, etc...but this also can be done without this.</p><p>If you are travelling with a healer, then the healer can raise you from your unconscious sleep with very little problems. Another way to implement this with some stamina changes. If you try to move with less than, say, 10 hit points then your movement is stamina is reduced greatly. For every step you take, say you lose 5 stamina. Thus if you are raised to consciousness by a healer, it raises you to exactly 5 hp and does a check just like with curing with bandages and/or resurrecting with bandages. Also, something could be added for the forensics evaluation teaming up with healing to make your chances greater to bring someone out of their unconscious state. If you are at 5 hp, then you won't be able to move until you are healed up a bit more. This brings in a more interesting type of combat system in my opinion and could make for a more varied type of PvP.</p><p>I've rambled on quite enough, what do you think of this?</p><p><a href=mailto:marduk@xrgn.com>Mard&uuml;k Dragon</a><br><a href=http://bugbase.xrgn.com/uoindex.htm target=_top>UO Bug Base</a></p>");</script>

<script>message("DD on the MUD-DEV list", "<p>I saw this over at UOSS concerning a post Designer Dragon made on the MUD-DEV list. DD responds to anothers post about the reasoning behind the creation of The Second Age and the changes they addressed:<BLOCKQUOTE>The areas which seemed to need addressing in UO after one year were numerous, of course. However, many of them were or wil be addressed as part of the standard upgrade and patch cycle. So that means that many issues relating to game balance, bugs, exploits, etc, aren't part of the second edition. You won't see measures against playerkilling in Second Age specifically, nor solutions for the excess of player houses, the popularity of certain skill combinations, etc. Such things get applied to the servers regardless of edition. That said, we identified a couple of areas to tackle: <P>1) Existing customers needed new challenges. What we did: new monsters that were noticeably tougher, new lands and dungeons, some new AI on the new monsters. The communications infrastructure in the original was almost non-existent. <P>2) No global chat whatsoever, not even a group-tell capability. What we did: we added a very IRC-like chat system that supports private messaging, conference creation, passwording, and moderation. We put it in a separate server altogether, required unique ids for it (we do not require unique names in UO), added ease-of-use things like commands menus, etc. Once we found that this window covered too much of the existing UO screen, we added the \"Big Window\" which allowed interface windows to be dragged off the view area. <P>3) UO is possibly more popular in a per capita sense overseas than it is in the US. Better support for players in Japan in particular seemed desirable (UO went to #1 PC software--not #1 game--in Japan on its original release), as well as Europe. What we did: 1) we added support for typing in Unicode, including the ability to type in the full Kanji character set using standard Windows Kanji controls. While we were at it we added more fonts for talking. 2) We integrated automatic translation software, as described in my other email. 3) We added pop-up translation for interface elements, and left this on the client side so that players could localize to more languages themselves. 4) We localized the pop-up help described below. 5) We localized the options menu (see below).<P>Even though UO uses very simple click-and-point for just about everything, it's still not accessible enough for the average gamer. There was no support for in-game help, no tutorial, and it was fairly daunting. 1) we moved all the options for the game from a config text file into a localizable options menu. 2) we added pop-up help triggered by mouse hover. The help is pulled from localized Unicode text files on the server. 3) We created a standalone tutorial that has a \"newbie wisp\" that follows you around giving advice. The standalone tutorial uses, essentially, a mini-server and client integrated into one, and thus has most of the elements of the full game, including all skills, spells, creature behaviors, etc, except presented on a subsection of the map. <P>The original landscape did not make as good use of the engine as it could have. What we did: Basically, I touched every screen of the map that the designers working for me did to maximise the use of the 3d terrain in the game. Emphasis was placed on making use of previously underutilized art sets such as jungle, swamp, arctic, and mountainous regions; and architecture, such as circular buildings and huts on stilts. Land space was utlized more effectively to give an illusion of more playable space with less actual area. <P>The original landscape was growing crowded, given the popularity of player housing. What we did: we laid out the map in such a way that small clearings connected by narrowish pathways encourage clustering of buildings in small groups, rather than the urban sprawl that has developed over much of Britannia (for an example of how the urban sprawl happens, check http://steroid.cchem.berkeley.edu/~fields/main.htm and follow the link for the map). <P>Players didn't group enough, and were very self-sufficient. What we did: we placed only two villages in the new lands. We supplied exactly two places to resurrect, but gave the ability to player healers. We made the creatures much tougher. We made the creatures more susceptible to certain previously underutilized player types (such as bards), and gave them abilities such as radiating cold causing area damage that require group tactics to fight effectively. We disabled the ability to teleport between the original map and the new map, requiring travel. We purposely made the new lands' geography intentionally misleading and easy to get turned around in without it being mazelike, and we use different sextant coordinates than on the mainland. The mapmaking skill is disabled in the new lands.</BLOCKQUOTE></p>");</script>

With netbus they can steal your uo info even if you don't have the save password option checked. Trust me, it happened to me. To easily find out if you have netbus on your machine, you can run a search on your computer to find a file called \"keyhook.dll\". If that file is on your computer, you have netbus and are in danger of being hacked. Go to this link <a href=\"http://www.nttoolbox.com/Netbus.htm\" target=\"_top\">http://www.nttoolbox.com/Netbus.htm</a> to learn more about removing netbus from your machine. From there you can download netbuster which will tell you when someone connects to your machine. And it will tell you if you have netbus installed on your machine. Very useful program to have. I suggest everyone should go check this out. Thank you for you time. Play safe everyone and keep the punks off of your machine.

<script>message("Concerns about next patch", "<p>This was forwarded to me:<blockquote>Currently on the test center you can stake your claim on houses. I spent a few hours testing it out yesterday. BUT, I found what I feel is a MAJOR flaw. <p>Right now you can only claim one house per character.  I can see that the intent here is to employ the one house per char limit.  But it is my feeling that this limit should not go into place until AFTER the houses are claimed.  Here is why:<p>1)Legitimate house owners can only claim one house per char even if they have more than one.  This leaves it open for theives and murderers to claim the others, even if the owner placed the house and has master keys to all his places.  Or if no one claims them, then (I assume) they just rot.  This gives the legitimate house owner no opportunity to police himself by turning the houses back to deeds or selling them off securely to other players. <p>I have about 10 houses on GL. I am not proud of this fact, and I look forward to having one house per char, and I could even accept one house per account.  What happened is this: I was guildmaster of a guild that numbered over 50 people at one point, and we bought several houses, one after the other, as they became unsecure from us being robbed or killed and looted. During this time I placed most of the houses, as I was guildmistress and also paid for about half the cost of all of them out of my own pocket.  When they became unsecure I refused to 'give in' to the pkers and theives by letting the houses rot.  I have been refreshing them faithfully every three days for over a year on some.  I have been looking forward to the day when I can tear them down myself or sell them securely to other parties.  I refuse to just let them rot.  <p>Here is my dilemma:  If I can only claim one house per char, there will be about 5 or so left over that can be claimed by the very same theives and pkers that took keys.  This doesn't seem fair to me.  In most cases, they 'got lucky' and stole keys while I was lagged out at the bank as I recalled in to deposit keys, or they killed a newbie that had keys on him way back in the beginning of the game.  I did the most honest work and paid the most money out of my own pocket for these buildings, let alone spending the time and effort to refresh them. They should all belong to me, as most of my guildmembers have moved on out of the game or to other shards or organizations.<p>If the limit of one house per char was implemented AFTER the houses were claimed, I would have the option to claim all the houses that I have a stake in.  I would happily turn them back into deeds or sell them off myself until I had just one per char or less.<p>2) here is another frightening scenario: I have had vendors placed on a house in vesper, where houses can no longer be placed since about March.  The owner of the house was kind enough to let me place 3 vendors there (before the one vendor per house limit) and sell my goods. This is Heather's Fine Goods in Vesper on Great Lakes.  It's a very popular store, and I hope to make it a public shop, so this is one house I will definitely be claiming.  The owner and placer of the house has quit UO and left the house to me.  The problem is, he left a guildstone inside that has the names of two people on it, of whom I cannot reach.  Having no Master Key, it is possible that should I use one of my 5 slots to make a claim on this house, one of the persons that are on the stone may show up and claim it over me, as a person on the guildstone has a higher claim than a person with a  vendor there. Not only will I lose this totally irreplaceable house, but also I will have given up another of my many houses that I could have claimed instead of this one.  This could all happen at the last minute of the system and I will not be able to remove my claim from this house to claim another.<p>Again, I feel that both of these nightmare scenarios can be fixed by implementing the one house per char limit AFTER the houses have been claimed.  I think that players should be able to claim all of the houses that they have a legitimate stake in, then have the power to police themselves by voluntarily getting rid of  the excess.  If they fail to do so, and a char still has claim to more than one house after a one or two week period, then all but one house could be deleted at random, as punishment for failing to police themselves.  This seems no different to me than when we were asked to voluntarily lower the volume of items in our banks. No one did it for us, unless we failed to do so ourselves.  <p>If you can see any loopholes in my plan, please share them... I would like to see any reasons why this suggestion is not viable.  You can post replies on the UOVault Dev Board Discussion <a href=\"http://www.uovault.com/boards/dd/messages/4367.shtml\" target=\"_top\">http://www.uovault.com/boards/dd/messages/4367.shtml</a></blockquote>Also, I had some ideas regarding the patch that I posted on the messageboard, one was the ability to destroy the crafted items (or redeed them) and the other was to add the ability to craft archery buttes (this has been needed for a long long time).</p>");</script>

It will report back as to the success of the claim. <li>If you have claimed this building in particular, an UNCLAIM button will be present. It will report back as to the success of the unclaim. <li>When the claim process ends, the top claim on the house will become the owner of the house. <i>Houses that have ties, or are not claimed, will be <b>deleted</b></i>. This is because if the house remains in dispute for two weeks, we don't think that the issue can be resolved. </ul> <li>If you are not a keyholder, it'll be a brass sign with the house name on it. <li>If you are a keyholder, it'll be the new house ownership menu, with said brass sign mounted on it: <ul> <li>Clicking the INFO, FRIENDS, and OPTIONS tabs will change the appearance of the window. <li>The first page will be the INFO screen. <ul> <li>The owner of the house will be listed.
