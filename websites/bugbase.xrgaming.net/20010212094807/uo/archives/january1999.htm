<script>message("Abyss Shard Update", "<p>From FYI:<blockquote>We thought it would be fun for you guys to test the latest changes to the game, including combat changes, in an Abyss shard.  Keeps things spicey, you know. :)  So, we have opened the Abyss specifically for this purpose.  Please enjoy the shard while it's up, and remember, it is a *test* shard and will be treated just like Test Center is, except, it's the Abyss.<p>Interested in more details about what's happening on the Abyss right now?  Well, read on!<p>Currently on the Abyss Test Center: <ol><li>There is no statloss for murderers.<p><li>There are no guards, except in the city of Britain.<p><li>There are skill and stat advancement gates around the city of Britain.  (That's the reason for the guards in Britain.)<p><li>Other regions of the world have Gold stones and Spellbook/Reagent stones.  Gold stones are located at Papua Bank, Moonglow near the moongate, Yew outside Empath Abbey and the east entrance to Trinisic.  Spellbook/Reagent stones are located outside Yew Crypt, north beach on Magincia island, Moonglow Greens, and SE of the Papua bank behind the reagent shop.<p><li>Color Wars:  Color Wars are probably the biggest feature in the Abyss right now.  These wars are going on in and around the desert west of Minoc.  There are 6 castles placed around the big open grassy area right before you enter the desert.  Each castle has a uniquely colored sign and front door.  These are: Yellow, Red, Green, Blue (this castle is located inside the desert), Orange, and Purple.  Each castle has a ressurection gate inside it that will ressurect all players, whether they are a murderer, or a criminal.  There is also a Trash Can which is expected to be used by people to throw extra junk away to reduce lag on the shard.  To help teams identify one another, there is a \"Dye Stone\" of approriate color with which team members can join one team or another by dying their clothes.  The Dye Stone looks just like a guildstone, and will be tinted the appropriate color.  You double click the Dye Stone to dye clothes, just as you would with a dye tub. Additionally each castle has a unique dispenser inside it to give players both reasons to secure the castle from invasion and to invade the castle. The Blue and Yellow castles have a reagent dispenser, Purple has plate armor, Red has arrows, bolts, and bow and crossbows, Orange has magical weapons, and Green has Spellbooks, Leather and Chain armor.  At the entrance to the desert are 6 colored guildstones which will indicate to the players which castles have what items.  The guildstones help the players get their bearings on the \"purpose\" of the Color Wars.<p><li>Finally, there is a new system in place that keeps track of the killing prowess of players by rewarding them kill points when defeating other players.  Everyone starts with 0 kill points.  Vanquishing a player (in other words, killing another player) will result in getting 10% of their kill points.  So if you kill someone with 100 kill points, you get 10 points and they are knocked down to 90 points.  The goal is to accumulate points by killing and not being killed.  Furthermore, it's better to kill a few players that have lots of kill points than a lot of players with little or no kill points. To find out how many kill points you have, simply say \"How many kill points have I\".  A message indicating your kill points will appear in the bottom left of your screen.  It is entirely possible to have killed 100 people and still have 0 kill points.  This means either you have killed a lot of people that have died repeatedly and are not worth any kill points or you yourself die a lot in the process of killing others.</ol> We hope you enjoy the Abyss Test Center and we look forward to your feedback about the shard.</blockquote></p>");</script>

(It behooves miners to conceal this location!) <LI>Even a known vein will not always yield the rare mineral. <LI>You cannot combine ore of different colors. <LI>You can only smelt the colored minerals if you meet the Mining skill requirement to do so. </LI></UL><LI>Blacksmithing <UL><LI>You cannot work the resultant ingots unless you meet the Blacksmithing skill requirement to do so. <LI>You can make colored armor and shields from the colored ingots. <I><B>You cannot make weapons from colored ingots, and doing so will just make a weapon that looks like one made from iron ore.</I></B> </LI></UL></LI></UL><LI><B>Combat changes</B> <UL><LI>Mace weapons now cause stamina loss and extra damage to armor when they hit an opponent. <LI>Your swing rate or firing rate with all weapons is now dependent on your current stamina, instead of your dexterity. <LI>Damage for your blow is now assessed on your opponent on the start of the swing, instead of at the end. This change makes a fast connection less of an advantage in melee combat. <LI>Equipping a weapon now causes a short \"prep time\" before you can start swinging. <LI>Being good at anatomy will give a bonus to the damage you do in combat. <LI>Being good at evaluating intelligence will give the ability to override your target's magic resistance. </LI></UL> <LI><B>Changes to magic</B> <UL><LI>Meditation goes in. This new skill allows faster regeneration of mana. <UL><LI>Your mana regeneration rate is now dependent on your level of Meditation skill, your intelligence stat, and the amount of armor you are wearing. This is termed the \"passive use\" of the skill. <LI>The skill can be used from the skill gump, or via a macro. <UL><LI>You cannot be holding anything nor be wearing metallic armor to use it. <LI>If you succeed, your mana regeneration rate is doubled from your usual rate while you meditate. <LI>You stop meditating if you do basically anything, including using another skill, trying to hide, moving, casting a spell, using or trying to pick up an object, etc. </LI></UL></LI></UL><LI>A problem with the polymorph spell getting \"stuck\" was fixed. <LI>The Magic Reflect spell now gives an error if the target already has Magic Reflect on, and does not consume mana or reagents. <LI>The magic lock spell now works against unsecure locked down containers. <LI>So does the magic untrap spell. </LI></UL><LI><B>Housing and furnishing changes</B> <UL><LI>The one-room house which ramdomly changed appearance every time you tried to place it no longer does so. <LI>Holiday trees and ornaments are deleted. Holiday tree deeds are unaffected, but are disabled until the holiday season next year. <LI>You can no longer deed a locked-down holiday tree. <LI>You can no longer attempt to pick the lock on a secure container. <LI>The \"large smithy\" has been renamed to \"large house with patio.\" <LI>Significant lockdown changes were made. Lockdown is no longer done with keys. Instead, it is done with spoken commands: <UL><LI>\"I wish to lock this down\" gives a targeting cursor and does basic lockdown. <LI>\"I wish to release this\" gives a targeting cursor and unsecures and releases the object from lockdown. <LI>\"I wish to secure this\" gives a targeting cursor and locks down and secures the object if it's a container. <LI>\"I wish to unsecure this\" gives a targeting cursor and only unsecures the container. It does not release it from lockdown. </LI></UL></LI></UL><LI><B>Granting karma to other players</B> <UL><LI>Saying \"I honor thee\" will bring up a targeting cursor. <LI>Targeting another player will remove karma points from you and give some karma points to your target. <LI>You have to have a positive karma of a certain level to do this. </LI></UL><LI><B>Other skills</B> <UL><LI>Using bandages will now unhide you. <LI>Mapmaking now has a skill delay. <LI>There is now a blacksmith NPC guild, and blacksmith guildmasters will appear in appropriate shops and halls. <LI>Animal tamers should rejoice: A problem whereby creatures lost stats when crossing server boundaries was fixed. This was most notable in the case of \"nerfed dragons.\" </LI></UL><LI><B>Miscellaneous</B> <UL><LI>Hair dye is now permanent. <LI>The error message given when you selected the last color on each page of hairdye is now fixed. <LI>Vendors will ignore you unless they hear their own name. This was done because of problems with many vendors turning to listen to you when you spoke, if there were many of them in close proximity. <LI>Some cave entrances to the Lost Lands have been slightly adjusted in terms of where you end up when you exit. <LI>A bug with the lighting and unlighting of the candle given to you when you start a character has been fixed. <LI>Poisonous creatures should start poisoning at the correct frequency again. <LI>The Jhelom dueling pit is open again. <LI>Several creatures which have been missing in the Lost Lands are back: <UL><LI>nightmares <LI>efreets <LI>hellcats <LI>hellcat predators </LI></UL><LI>Some map errors were corrected. </LI></UL></LI></UL></blockquote></p><p>Now that's a lot of stuff :)</p>");</script>

This does not affect the total weight a player is allowed to carry. This is the current misconception. The reason for this being is because strength used to affect naked body weight. When this was the case, the average body weight for players ranged from 25-35 stones. This was reflected on the total body weight on the character status window. Now, regardless of a player's strength, a character only weighs 10 stones.
