<script>message("1st Stage of Housing Patch", "<p>From the Update Center:<blockquote>Today the first stage of ownership goes in, with vendors being packed up into deeds so they can be moved to new          locations. Be sure to remove your house keys from your vendors before you pack them up into deeds! Items left          on your vendors will be inaccessible while they are in deed form.           The latest server update is being published to all servers today. This update includes the first stages of house          ownership. Of special note are furniture lockdown and the transfer of vendors from outside of buildings to new          locations. The Game Updates page has been duly updated to reflect the new            The fact that vendors will only be allowed inside public buildings means that until ownership is fully installed,           many of the vendors you are used to frequenting will not be available. We understand that this transition period           will be inconvenient, and hope that you will bear with us.</blockquote>The following is the area from the Latest Updates page concerning housing:<ul><li><b>HOUSING</b><br>  These changes are all related to the upcoming transition to housing. We realize that there are still aspects of the plan which are  controversial; however, we are proceeding with the aspects that received general approval.  <ul>  <li>Vendor packing up:    <ul>    <li>When the owner says \"vendor\" (or equivalent to keyword to the vendor) it checks to see if it is in a valid location.    <li>Valid locations are inside houses owned by the owner (currently keyholder).  Once ownership is complete, friends of a house will also be able to        place vendors in a house.    <li>If the vendor is not in a valid location, he turns into a deed in your backpack.       <ul>      <li>The deed does not weigh a ton, as it would if all the vendor's stuff were in there.       <li>The deed does not affect the item limits on the backpack.       <li>The deed is called \"a deed for a vendor named <so n so>\" so you can tell who you are moving.       <li>The deed works like any vendor deed. To place him you just use the deed in a valid location.      </ul>    <li>The limit on vendors in a single building is now set up at 100.     </ul>  <li>Teleporting guildstones in invalid locations (meaning, guildstones in tents)    <ul>    <li>When the guildmaster double-clicks the stone, he receives a guild transportation stone.    <li>This stone he can take to a valid location and teleport the guildstone there by using his transporter stone.    <li>During this time, all guild members cannot access the stone.    </ul>  <li>Tent reimbursal    <ul>    <li>When doublclicking on a tent chest for the first time, the player (if they are the owner of the tent, determined        by whether they have a valid key) will have all the chest contents placed in his bank as well as a sum gold of 10,000 gold.    <li>The chest is then destroyed.    </ul>  <li>Housing lockdown.    <ul>    <li>Use of a house key on any item (not creature) within the house allows toggling lockdown state IF the owner is the person using the key.    <li>In the initial implementation, any keyholder is an owner. Once ownership goes in, owners and friends will be able to do lockdown.    <li>Targeting an item not already locked down :      <ul>      <li>Will lock down the item if the following conditions are met:         <ul>        <li>The item is not adjacent to a door.        <li>The total number of locked down items on the multiobj does not exceed the set maximum. The maximum depends on the size of the building. Here is a table. The numbers are somewhat approximate, because even though the buildings grouped together are extremely similar, they do vary slightly, and therefore may have one or two more or less lockdowns than described below.<p>         </ul>        <li>Generic items cannot be locked down.      <li>Items flagged as locked down cannot be chopped with axes.      <li>Containers that are locked down may become secure. If they are secure, they can only be opened by a keyholder. Again, once ownership goes in, they will only be openable by the owner and friends of the house.         <ul>        <li>If the locked-down container count does not exceed the max number of secure containers for the building, the container is made secure.            The maximum number of secure containers depends on the building's size.          <ul>          <li>Looking at a secure chest will tell you that it is \"[secure]\"          <li>The locker is notified that he has created a new secure container, and told how many more his buildings can support.          </ul>        <li>If the max number of secure containers has been reached, the container is locked down, but a message is given that it is not a secure container because the building's capacity for secure containers has been reached.        </ul>      </ul>     <li>Targeting a locked down item \"unlocks\" it so you can move it again. If it was a secure container, it ceases to be secure.    </ul>  </ul></ul>A complete list can be found at <a href=\"http://update.owo.com/latest.html\" target=\"_top\">http://update.owo.com/latest.html</a>.</p>");</script>

<script>message("New Patch: Vendors and Houses", "<p>From the Common Issues page:<blockquote>There appears to be some confusion concerning this latest patch. As part of the plan for the new housing code, this patch puts UO in a temporary \"no build\" period; which lasts until we finish the housing revision. <p></p>In this \"no build\" period, players will not be able to place any more houses or vendors. Do NOT page a GM about placing a house or vendor, they will not be able to help you. </p><p>Existing Vendors: If your home has an attached vendor to it, the owner of the home will still be able to withdraw items from the vendor. However, when the owner speaks to the vendor, the vendor will turn back into a deed with all its belongings in the deed. The owner will once again be able to place their vendor with all its belongings once the \"no build\" period is over. In relation, we ask all players to remove necessary items from their vendor (ie. house keys) before returning the vendor back into deed form.</blockquote>So, take your keys off the vendor if they are your only keys to your house else you'll have tons of problems :P</p>");</script>

<script>message("Housing Plan Updated", "<p>The Comments from the Dev Team section of the OWO site was updated with this a few minutes ago:<blockquote>We'd like to fill you in on the latest updates to the housing plan, based on feedback from players. We've received many comments on the plan, and are pleased that overall it was so well-received.<p> Probably the most controversial part of the plan was maintenance for houses. We are going to proceed with all the other stages of the ownership update, and then we will evaluate how much space has been freed up by the changes made. After that, we will decide whether or not maintenance or other measures need to be put in place. It is likely that if we do maintenance, it will entail payment in either materials, or gold, but with an additional surcharge for paying in gold. For now, however, it is on hold.<p> Concerns were expressed by merchants regarding their safety whilst in public buildings, and for privacy in public buildings. The following two measures will therefore be part of the housing plan:<ul><li>Public buildings will have the option to declare their building to be a guarded zone. Lord British's guards will respond to crimes just as they do in the cities.<li>It will be possible to lock interior doors in public buildings. This does mean that it will become an additional perk of public buildings to have vendors in locked back rooms.</ul>With maintenance possibly not going in, we are adding an additional benefit to having a public house, in hopes that more players will use public houses. Public houses will have more secure storage than a private house.<p> Many players wished for reimbursal of buildings that are \"sold back.\" We will be giving 10,000 gp to players who collapse their tents during the first phase of housing implementation. We realize that many players paid 22,000gp for their tents; many others, however, only paid 4,000, and we chose a middle ground for the reimbursal value.<p> We are not going to be able to let you sell back your houses during the claim period, unfortunately. Too many houses are contested, and we don't feel comfortable with allowing sell-back until after ownership is settled. However, once ownership is fully in place, you will be able to sell back your house, effectively demolishing it.<p> Lastly, many players have inquired as to how many lockdowns and secure containers will be available in each house type. Here is a table. The numbers are somewhat approximate, because even though the buildings grouped together are extremely similar, they do vary slightly, and therefore may have one or two more or less lockdowns than described below.<p> <table border=1 cellborder=1><tr> <td><b>Building<br>Type</b><td><b>Approximate<br>Lockdowns</b><td><b>Secure<br>containers</b></tr><tr>   <td>Stone and Plaster House<br>Field Stone House<br>Small Brick House<br>Wooden House<br>Wood and Plaster House<br>Thatched Roof Cottage<br>Blacksmith shop<br>Clothier shop<br>Miller shop<br>Pickpocket's Den<br>Weapon Training Hut<br>  <td>25<td>1</tr><tr>   <td>Brick House<br>Bakery<br>Smithy<br>Tailor Shop<br>  <td>86  <td>4</tr><tr>   <td>2 Story Wood and Plaster House<br>2 Story Stone and Plaster House  <td>108  <td>5</tr><tr>   <td>Tower<td>244<td>12</tr><tr>   <td>Small Stone Keep<td>375<td>19</tr><tr> <td>Castle<td>577<td>29</tr></table> </td> </tr> </table></blockquote>How do these changes sound to you?

We welcome more ideas on what we can do to help merchants & public buildings feel less vulnerable.<p>A top suggestion has been interior lockable doors in public buildings. We're highly dubious about this, honestly. There's no support for it right now, and it gives public buildings, basically, hoard space. We'd have to case out vendor placement in the lockable rooms--and right now there isn't even a concept of \"room\" in the code for player buildings. :( So it'd be a fair amount of work and might prove to be too cumbersome or slow to work. <p>-DD</BLOCKQUOTE></p>");</script>

The Black Rose Brewery in the player city of Corwyn hosted a meeting that saw the founding of the Chesapeake Council of the Virtues Alliance.

These guilds were invited and have shown interest though have not necessarily declared membership.)</p><p>The founders are very excited by the interest and submit the following information for all to read and understand. </p><p>The Council of Virtues has one main purpose. That purpose is to make UO a more enjoyable place for those who reside on the Chesapeake Shard. We are not an army that will hunt PK guilds, we do not seek to stop PvP combat, and we simply wish to Protect and Enlighten. Too long have the people of Sosaria gone without guidance or help. Too long have we suffered from apathy, self-interest, greed, and isolation. In an effort to spread quest interest and involvement, as well as much needed protection from various anti-social elements, we, The Council of Virtues, have formed from some of the greatest guilds of Chesapeake in order to bring peace, prosperity, and the Virtues to all of the shard, our home! No longer will an evil raid trouble a guild event! No longer will we be forced to endure the loss of home and hall! Join with us Chesapeake, together we can do anything, alone the void drowns our words away in a sea of empty blackness. Join us and let Your Voices be heard!</p><p>The Council of Virtues. </p><p>What is it? What is this all about anyway? Many of you are, no doubt, asking this because a simple description just isn't enough. Well my friends I shall attempt to describe us in greater detail.</p><p>	CoV is made up of some of the most prominent guilds on the Chesapeake Shard. The reasons for this alliance are simple. Many of you in your UO experiences have encountered many things that try your patience and almost make you quit. For starters, all of us hate to die and most hate it even more to be murdered by other players who then strip our corpse clean of all possessions, even our valueless boots or hat. Do you ever ask yourselves why they do this? Do you think, Gee, this person killed me so easily, surely he does this kind of thing all the time so he must be pretty rich... hmmm, why would he take my clothes then? Yes the clothes I spent 2 hours on, picking out just the right colors, finding just the right hat. The answer is simple friends; they do it because it hurts you! I have often found it hard to believe that there are people like this out there. The same people I see everyday on the streets of my real life town. How can civilization be hiding such deep dark things just below the surface? Yet it is so. This is something that goes far beyond UO to the heart and soul of Humanity as a whole. Is this ridiculous to be speaking of in an online game? *grinning* Yes! The point I am trying to make is that people are often cruel. In real life we have laws, police and courts. In UO we have Merciless</p><p> Town Guards! </p><p>Outside of town we are all in dire straits. Is there nothing we can do? </p><p>The answer is yes; there is plenty we can do. Many have tried in the past but have failed for two reasons. One, they hunted all PK bands. Two, they where not large enough to withstand an assault from more than one of these bands at a time and so eventually these past alliances failed. What is the difference with this alliance then? We do not hunt PK bands. We do not seek out battles. Our intention is to force peace by size alone! Picture if you will yet another attack on Pax Lair by 15 armed and extremely well trained PKs. Suddenly 50 to 100 men surround them but do not attack. Imagine that these men will not attack the PKs unless they themselves where attacked. Perhaps even then all we would do is heal anyone over and over again so that they could never be killed! What would these PKs do, supposing they haven’t already recalled? The key to success here is to overwhelm them with numbers and only attacked if provoked. If we can thwart even some attempts made at disruptive and evil behavior we have won!</p><p>Next, as we work our magic upon the land, more and more people will come to see that the virtuous ways that we endorse are the right ways and even the norm. We are here to enlighten the people of Chesapeake and show them a better way that they have never been shown before!</p><p>Some may say, but PKing is so fun, I am so bored with this game that this is all I have left. Hmmm, how to answer this eh? Simple Get involved! CoV will try to keep everyone informed and up to date on UO quests, player run quests and events, through a vast network of informed and active players. CoV may even be looking at sponsoring an annual Chesapeake Olympics. *smile* How fun would that be? Lets not forget the other many Guild events that may be joined in or even perhaps a small group of non-guilded folks wishing to have some events of their own. CoV will help you.</p><p>	So you see my friends, we CAN make a difference. We shall enhance the UO experience to the utmost of our abilities through role-playing, quests, events, and even protection from the anti-socials out there. Any in this alliance may feel free to call upon the combined might of CoV at any time in any circumstance where their might is needed. Any outside of the alliance may feel free to ask questions, get involved, make suggestions, or even request aid. If some one is always waiting at the edge of town to kill your miner after 3 hours of hard work, let us know about it. None of us like such things and the CoV is against these UO ruining experiences and anything like them.</p><p>If you reside on Chesapeake and are interested in joining please feel free to contact me!

<script>message("TC Updates", "<p>This was on the Game Updates page:<ul><li><b>EXPLOITS</b><br>Numerous loopholes used by third-party programs will be corrected. As we have stated before, we intend to continue moving aggressively to prevent these programs from having any utility. We don't wish to describe all of the fixes we made, so that exploiters have as little warning as possible, but one change in particular merits notice.    <ul>    <li>The \"Fast last-target spellcasting\" exploit will be corrected. This involved placing a small skill delay after completion of casting.  </ul>  <li><b>SKILLS</b>  <ul>  <li>We fixed a cause of the overly rapid stat advancement. Skills that affect more than one stat will no longer cause accelerated gain for all of the stats.  <li>The magic resistance skill will no longer raise any stats.  This was done because this skill causes involuntary stat gains when you are attacked with magic.  <li>The last skills which had learn by watching still enabled will no longer have it enabled:    <ul>    <li>Begging    <li>Evaluate Intelligence    <li>Animal lore    <li>Anatomy    </ul>  <li>Various cooking issues were addressed:    <ul>    <li>Problems with transferring liquid from bottle to bottle will be fixed.      <li>Sweet dough will now be a different color.      <li>It will now be possible to make cake. Before, mixing sweet dough and flour gave cake mix, but cooking it gave cookies, instead of cake.    </ul>  <li>A textual bug in the anatomy skill will be fixed. It will no longer give human references to animals.  <li>Provocation will check vertical distance.  <li>Tailoring gained a line-of-sight check.  <li>You will not be able to shear sheep through walls.  </ul>  <li><b>SPELLS</b>  <ul>  <li>Players will be unhidden by speaking words of power when casting spells.  <li>Casting blade spirits in player-built towers should be fixed.  <li>The Dispel Field spell will be fixed.  <li>Guild titles and abbreviations will no longer display when incognito.  </ul>  <li><b>ITEMS</b><ul><li>Armor will also go through the same sort of \"retroactive fix\" that was recently put in for weapons. This will eliminate \"pre-patch\" armor with excessive bonuses. <li>Lighting a torch within your backpack will automatically equip it.<li>A bug allowing you to combine ore and get around the regular container limits will be fixed.  <li>You will be able to choose what color to dye your hair with hair dyes.    <ul><li>A menu will pop up letting you choose from blonde, red, black, gray, or brunette.    <li>A random color is chosen from within that range.    <li>Also, the dyes will be permanent, instead of wearing out.    <li>The bug with incognito making hair dyes permanent was fixed as well.    </ul>  <li>The spyglass will now give the moon phases when double-clicked.   </ul>  <li><b>MAP</b>  <ul>  <li>Several Lost lands entrances will become impossible to teleport into.  <li>Housing will not be allowed next to Lost Lands entrances.  <li>Lowered the spawn rate on crops in order to prevent excessive spawning.    <ul>    <li>Cotton    <li>Cabbage    <li>Carrots    <li>Lettuce    <li>Onions    </ul>  <li>Several map bugs will be corrected.  </ul>  <li><b>CREATURES</b>  <ul>  <li>The following creatures will become aggressive:     <ul>     <li>Ancient wyrms       <li>Dragons       <li>Reapers       <li>Giant silver serpents       <li>Corpsers       <li>Kraken       <li>Swamp tentacles     </ul>  <li>Energy vortices and blade spirits will also be more aggressive.  <li>The problem with dragons stopping breathing fire when reactive armor is cast on them will be fixed.  </ul>  <li><b>HOUSING</b><br>  These changes are all related to the upcoming transition to housing. We realize that there are still aspects of the plan which are  controversial; however, we are proceeding with the aspects that received general approval.  <ul>  <li>Vendor packing up:    <ul>    <li>When the owner says \"vendor\" (or equivalent to keyword to the vendor) it checks to see if it is in a valid location.    <li>Valid locations are inside houses owned by the owner (currently keyholder).  Once ownership is complete, friends of  use will also be able to place vendors in a house.   <li>If the vendor is not in a valid location, he turns into a deed in your backpack.       <ul>      <li>The deed does not weigh a ton, as it would if all the vendor's stuff were in there.       <li>The deed does not affect the item limits on the backpack.       <li>The deed is called \"a deed for a vendor named <so n so>\" so you can tell who you are moving.       <li>The deed works like any vendor deed. To place him you just use the deed in a valid location.      </ul>    <li>The limit on vendors in a single building is now set up at 100.     <li>Currently you can place the transferred vendor in a building for testing the whole moving process      <ul>      <li>We will be disabling this before publish to the public.      <li>Placement works exactly like regular placement of vendors does.      </ul>    </ul>  <li>Teleporting guildstones in invalid locations (meaning, guildstones in tents)    <ul>    <li>When the guildmaster double-clicks the stone, he receives a guild transportation stone.    <li>This stone he can take to a valid location and teleport the guildstone there by using his transporter stone.    <li>During this time, all guild members cannot access the stone.    </ul>  <li>Tent reimbursal    <ul>    <li>When doublclicking on a tent chest for the first time, the player (if they are the owner of the tent, determined        by whether they have a valid key) will have all the chest contents placed in his bank as well as a sum gold of 10,000 gold.    <li>The chest is then destroyed.    </ul>  <li>Housing lockdown.    <ul>    <li>Use of a house key on any item (not creature) within the house allows toggling lockdown state IF the owner is the person using the key.    <li>In the initial implementation, any keyholder is an owner. Once ownership goes in, owners and friends will be able to do lockdown.    <li>Targeting an item not already locked down :      <ul>      <li>Will lock down the item if the following conditions are met:         <ul>        <li>The item is not adjacent to a door.        <li>The total number of locked down items on the multiobj does not exceed the set maximum. The maximum depends on the size of the building.        </ul>        <li>Generic items cannot be locked down.      <li>Items flagged as locked down cannot be chopped with axes.      <li>Containers that are locked down may become secure. If they are secure, they can only be opened by a keyholder. Again, once ownership goes          in, they will only be openable by the owner and friends of the house.        <ul>       <li>If the locked-down container count does not exceed the max number of secure containers for the building, the container is made secure.            The maximum number of secure containers depends on the building's size.	  <ul>          <li>Looking at a secure chest will tell you that it is \"[secure]\"          <li>The locker is notified that he has created a new secure container, and told how many more his buildings can support.          </ul>        <li>If the max number of secure containers has been reached, the container is locked down, but a message is given that it is not a secure container because the building's capacity for secure containers has been reached.        </ul>      </ul>     <li>Targeting a locked down item \"unlocks\" it so you can move it again. If it was a secure container, it ceases to be secure.    </ul>  </ul>    <li><b>GUILDS</b>  <ul>  <li>Declaring peace will now properly give the name of the guild you declared peace with.  </ul><li><b>IN TESTING</b><br>  The following items are in place on Test Center, but will <i>not</i> be part of the next update. They are in place merely for ongoing testing.  <ul>  <li>The higher your evaluate intelligence, the easier it will be to overcome your target's magic resistance skill.  <li>The higher your anatomy skill, the more damage you are likely to do to your opponent with each blow.  <li>Strength no longer gives a bonus to archery damage.  <li>The parrying skill is twice as effective as it used to be against anged weapons.  <li>We are testing a new skill to be called <i>Meditation</i>. This is often referred to among players as \"channeling.\" The higher this skill      is, the faster your mana will regenerate. However, the more armor you are wearing, the less effect you will get. We are temporarily using      the Spirit Speak skill as the value of this Meditation skill.  </ul></ul></p>");</script>

We are currently looking at the following line items in response to some of the comments:<ul><li>Making public buildings guard zones (either automatically or for an additional fee)<li>Providing reimbursal for tents if owners clean them up before the deadline for deletion</ul>The most controversial aspect of the plan is house maintenance costs. However, we do not currently have any viable alternatives, though we welcome more discussion of the issue. Many players asked for rough figures on how much time should be spent on maintenance. Our best guess at this point is one hour a week for a small house, scaling up to amounts of time that basically oblige multiple maintainers for castles.<p> We have seen the concerns about availability of sufficient materials. This is something easily addressed when the time comes, so we ask that people not worry too much about that. :) We can scale the availability of wood from trees and of ore from mountains to any amount we need in order to provide enough for house maintenance.</blockquote>");</script>

<script>message("From the Game Updates page", "This was on the Game Updates page:<ul><li>Crop growth in the Lost Lands should be slowed.<li>When a thief dies in town, items he stole within the last two minutes will be automatically placed in their owner's backpack. If the owner is not around to receive them, they will fall to the ground.<li>Pets and hirelings will move to attack when so ordered, and will move to attack when guarding something that is disturbed. They will no longer stand still all the time, but will loiter around the last place where they were given a command (unless they are following, of course).<li>Carving corpses will now always leave the results of carving on the corpse, where players can then grab it. This was done in order to limit  the amount of stuff left laying on the ground after carving.<li>Several house break-in methods will be fixed.<li><b>The new weapons scale</b><ul>This is the first pass at balancing weapons. It is not intended to be a final balance for weapons, but rather a good starting point. We expect there to be individual weapons and possibly weapons proficiencies that will require further tweaks.    <li>A retroactive weapons fixer will adjust weapons to fit the new weapons statistics going in. This code will attempt to transfer over your old weapons and adjust them to the correct weapons scale. It will fix one-hit weapons, \"prepatch\" weapons with outdated damage ratings, weapons with multiply applied magical bonuses, and similar problems. However, it may not function perfectly with all particular combinations of weapon abilities. In particular, exceptional quality weapons may lose some of their capability in the adjustment.    <li>The first pass at weapons statistics will be in place. Key features here are that all three weapons proficiencies should be comparable in effectiveness in combat, but they will all require different tactics to use well. They will also prove to have different strengths against different types of opponents (eg, some weapon types will do better against heavy armor than others, and some will be more effective against mages, etc).</ul><li><b>Skill advancement changes</b><ul>Again, these changes are expected to require additional tweaking. In particular, we'll need to keep an eye out for the advancement rate on stats, to determine whether they advance too fast or too slowly.    <li>Skill atrophy was adjusted so that it picks the least-used skills more often.    <li>Skill atrophy also was slowed so that it occurs less often. This was done to compensate for \"seesawing\" effects that were manifesting on the Test Center.    <li>Stat atrophy will now <i>only</i> happen when you reach the stat cap at 225.    <li>The skill advancement curve has been tweaked so that it will taper off start around a skill level of 45 for the typical skill (it will vary depending on the skill).    <li>Stat advancement will now occur <i>regardless</i> of your skill level. So even if you are already a grandmaster in a skill, your stats will continue to advance from use of the skill.    <li>Stats also have a minimum chance to advance.    <li>With the above changes, stat advancement has been slowed down.    <li>It will be possible to reach 100 in any skill. Previously, some skills couldn't reach 100.    <li>Holding a spellbook in your hands will prevent the learning of tactics or wrestling. <i>Mages should make careful note of this, as the new skill advancement changes will result in problems for them otherwise!</i></ul><li><b>Individual skills</b><ul>    <li>The healing skill now advances properly, including increased difficulty for curing poison and resurrecting, so that healers with a skill higher than 93 should now be able to advance by resurrecting people.    <li>Tailors will now be able to craft surcoats, tunics, jester's suits, and leather caps. All but the leather caps will be dyeable.    <li>Blacksmiths who are GMs or near GMs will be able to craft exceptional breastplates.    <li>When a grandmaster blacksmith crafts an exceptional item, the item will have a \"maker's mark\"--its name will have \"crafted by <name>\" appended to it.    <li>It will be possible to craft exceptional and below average quality bows, crossbows, and heavy crossbows. These will have differing damages just like exceptional quality smithed weapons do. In addition, they will have maker's marks if they are exceptional and are crafted by grandmaster bowyers.    <li>Alchemy will no longer give \"So and so continues grinding\" messages to bystanders.     <li>Provocation will now be considered a single act, as far as the reputation system is concerned, instead of \"controlling\" the creature for the long term. This means that actions taken by the creature after your provocation is complete will not affect your standing in the reputation system. (This also means that you will not gain karma and fame for creatures your provoked creatures kill. We will see about adding this back in eventually.)</ul></ul></p>");</script>

Special thanks go out, as usual, to Marduk and Goldcard for organizing testing efforts, and also to Kragg the Grim, Bon Scott, Khadgar, Pryito, Slone, Wink, and Valine of Yew, among others.

<script>message("Housing Plan", "<p>This was posted on the Update Center:<p>As many of you know, we have been discussing a housing ownership update for quite some time. There are several goals to this update, and we have a tentative plan which we'd like to lay out here for comment from the citizens of Britannia.</p><p>Working on the design for this has been very difficult. There are several competing priorities players have that seem to conflict with priorities on the development side:<ul><li>Players want more storage space in general. In particular, they would like the space inside houses to be secure storage.<li>Players almost universally want houses and vendors--they are both very popular features.<li>Players would also like to see a lot less houses cluttering the landscape.<li>The Dev Team would like fewer objects on the landscape, because it will improve performance for players, and it will reduce the size (and hence duration) of backups.<li>The Dev Team would also like to avoid increasing secure storage, as it likewise leads to increased backup size.<li>The Dev Team would like encourage \"public\" uses of housing, so that more players can benefit from a given house, rather than every player having multiple houses.</ul></p><p>Because of this, any plan presented for housing must entail compromises on both sides. The world of <i>Ultima Online</i> is not, unfortunately, infinitely capacious nor infinitely malleable. With the assistance of the many players who discussed this issue in many different discussion areas, and the many players who put up websites and polls about the issue, we've arrived at this plan, which we hope can serve as the nucleus for a final design.</p><p>Note that this plan is <i>not</i> yet final, and will not be until after we have received player feedback. As usual, we will be monitoring all the various discussion areas, including the ones on various websites and on Usenet. If there is something in here with which you disagree, please do post so that we can see your comments, and if possible, amend the design before it goes into practice! In particular, we expect that the <a href = \"http://yew.webtoys.net/homes/\" target=\"_top\" class=l1>Housing Discussion Page</a> will serve as an important resource, as it has throughout this process.</p><p><i>Tackling the tents</i></p><p>The first step we'd like to tackle is removing tents from the game. Why? Because they account for fully half the buildings in Britannia. Although the removal of one tent doesn't match the removal of even a small house in terms of object reduction, they do account for up to a third of the house components on a server. In other words, getting rid of them can make a very big difference. They may return someday, but for now, we propose to simply eliminate them.</p><p>But in order to get rid of them, we need to address the reasons why they are so popular:<ol><li>They are the cheapest, fastest way to get a vendor up and running.<li>They offer a secure chest for item storage.<li>They are used to create \"courtyards\" in front of other types of buildings, to add to building security.</ol></p><p>Clearly, increasing house security can address two out of the three reasons. To that end, the first thing that we propose to do is put in the ability for the holder of a house key to \"lock down\" items. This means that these items would be immovable except to someone else who has a key (who would be able to unlock the item to move it). What we are planning at the moment is allowing the lockdown of basically anything, up to a fixed limit based on the size of the house. Hence, a small house might only have a capacity for 20 locked down items, and a large castle could well handle a couple hundred. Trading a hundred secure items for the four tents in a castle courtyard is still a net gain in our view. Now, this doesn't offer total security yet, as if you lose your key, your locked down items can still be taken. But later parts of the housing proposal handle this scenario. The sole exception to item lockdown is that we do not feel we can provide secure lockdown of \"stackable\" items--reagents, gold, and most raw materials for crafting. This is because there are many ways to use up the items without actually taking them. So we will allow you to lock them down, but be aware that they are not truly secure.</p><p>The second thing we do is add a feature to lockdown: every building would have a maximum number of secure containers (the ideal place to put those stackable items that you can't securely lock down!). When you lock down a container, it will automatically become a secure container, unless you have already made all the secure containers a building can hold. These secure containers would only be openable by the owner of the building or their designated \"friends\" (see below). At first, this would mean a keyholder, but it would automatically shift over once ownership was fully in place.</p><p>Now, this runs the risk of increasing hoarding and backup size, of course. The desire here is to provide players with the secure storage they crave, but make sure that it is both tied to a location (so that the many items within the container are not crossing the server boundaries, slowing down inter-server traffic) and within a container (so that it does not need to be sent to passersby).</p><p>Once we put in the lockdown feature and the new secure containers, we'd ask players to move all the contents of the secure chests left behind by tents into other locations, such as actual houses or the bank. They would get a period of two weeks to do so.</p><p><i>Creating real shops</i></p><p>That brings us to vendors. We'd like to foster the use of shops, rather than roadside vendors. Shops are a more social experience, can provide more fictional atmosphere, and can be coupled with the lockdown feature to allow larger inventories for merchants. So we propose to not permit vendors outside of buildings anymore. Instead, the capability to have more than one vendor per building would be added. We would also add the ability for the owner of the building to allow vendors placed by others as well, so that players can create mini-malls or marketplaces which house multiple businesses. However, in order to ensure that vendors are used as shops, and not as banks, we will remove the ability to lock the front door of shops. In other words, the building will be designated as \"public.\"</p><p>This will allow those merchants who value the location of their current vendors to replace their tent with a building in the same location, and create a nice shop. Additional features, such as adding the ability to customize the shop sign to use the graphic for whatever shop type the owner designates, and for automatic advertising on bulletin boards, allows the shop to function better.</p><p>Once these changes go in, the first time a vendor owner visits his vendor to collect gold, the vendor will turn back into a deed with all the contents of the shop intact within the deed. This deed will automatically be placed in the owner's bank box. The deed will be placeable in valid locations (inside a building, or in a stall) and will restore the vendor to exactly the way they were before they were moved. Once again, there will be a two week period to visit your vendor and turn it into a deed.</p><p>Then we delete the tents. The secure chests and vendors not yet cleaned up will be deleted with all contents after the two week period.</p><p><i>The transition to house ownership</i></p><p>Changing over to house ownership means that many players have to give up many of the houses they own. The current plan is to allow one house per <i>character.</i> This means that there is still the possibility of a player with mules owning five houses. However, we do have measures planned to combat that.</p><p>The process of changing over to an ownership model will require a claim period. We currently plan to have this period last two weeks. During this time, <i>no houses will be able to be placed, and no vendor deeds will be able to be placed.</i> This includes the vendor that you most likely just got done turning back into a deed to move it. We realize that this means that there will be a period between two and four weeks during which virtually no vendors will be available. Unfortunately, we do not see any way around this (though ideas are welcome!)</p><p>Any player with a valid claim can double-click the house sign to register their claim on a given house. A given character can only lay one claim. At the end of the two weeks, the house is awarded to the player with the best claim. Validity of the claims will be determined thus:</p><p><ol><li>The placer of the house.<li>The holder of the master key to the house (the one labeled \"a house key\")<li>The guildmaster of the guild contained within the house.<li>The holder of a regular key to the house (the one labeled just \"a key\")<li>A member of the guild contained within the house.<li>The owner of a vendor attached to the house.</ol>We realize that this claim process cannot be perfect. In particular, the order given above places the placer of the house above the current holder of the master key. Our logic here is that your master key may have been stolen, in which case you should have precedence over the thief. On the other hand, you may have bought your house with master key from someone who sold it to you. In which case, since they were honest enough to give you the master key, we are going to trust them to be honest enough to not claim the house over you. However, this is one of the areas we'd most like to see discussed on the boards.</p><p>At all times during this process, the sign will give a report of all the claims lodged, and who the current frontrunner is for claiming the house. No new houses will be placeable during this period. And at the end of the two weeks, ownership will be assigned to the owner as determined by this process. In the case of claims where there are two claims of equal priority, we're just going to delete the house, on the grounds that nobody knows who owns it really, and nobody is likely to want to take the hours to sort out who might be in the right in a given case. In order to make sure that unintentional conflicts do not cause the loss of a building, players will be able to withdraw claims to houses as well. We will also be deleting all houses that nobody at all claimed.</p><p><i>So what does ownership entail?</i></p><p>Every house will know exactly who its owner is. And this owner would be the one with the power to lock down items, transfer ownership to another player for house sales, demolishing the house, and so on. But most importantly, they will be the one who maintains the building.</p><p>That's right, maintains it.</p><p>The maintenance fee for a house will be scaled based on how big it is, and also on how many items you have locked down in it. <b>But</b> it will be reduced for public buildings, such as shops, taverns, and other buildings which choose to not have a lockable door. This would be another option the owner of a building can select (of course, it is automatic when you place a vendor in the building). Right now we are thinking at least a 50% reduction in maintenance costs for having a public building. And we expect the costs to be moderately steep, to encourage cooperation in maintaining large buildings. Public buildings will also have a \"contribution box\" into which any interested player can drop contributions towards the upkeep of the public establishment.</p><p>The kicker is that the fee is not payable in gold. Instead, it is paid in logs and ingots and ore and other raw materials. It is literally the ongoing house repairs you need to make to keep your house in good order. We choose this route to enhance the roles of tradespeople.</p><p>Beyond this, the first pass of ownership would also include the ability to change the locks on the front door (if the building is unlockable, it means that the old keys no longer work for locking down items). And what we cheerfully call \"Texas Law\" would apply--the owner of the house can attack anyone who is within their building, without incurring any reputation system penalties--as if they were criminal flagged. Note that Texas Law will <i>not</i> apply to public buildings, as we do not wish them to become death traps. Owners of public buildings will have to use the measures available to them under the reputation system, until a later date when more house defense measures can be imposed.</p><p>Players will be able to designate \"friends\" of their house as well, who will have similar \"Texas Law\" privileges, will be able to contribute materials to house upkeep, and will have some of the capabilities of an owner. In particular, \"friends\" will be the ones allowed to place vendors in the building if the owner has granted them permission to do so.</p><p>Additional measures will be possible, once we have ownership fully in place, ranging from house guards and bouncers to alarm systems, traps, and other measures. But we will be holding off on these frills until we see that the above measures are working.</p><p><i>But what about crowding?</i></p><p>Well, there is one key thing that will be going in to reduce building crowding. Once buildings can be placed again, houses will have a larger area around them that <i>must</i> be empty in order to place the building. We currently plan for five tiles (five steps) around each building. This means that most small clearings, all the very edges of coastlines, the edges of mountains, and many other locations will no longer be eligible for new building placement. Current buildings will not suffer penalties for being in ineligible locations, but since we expect to see many buildings vanish during the claim process, we hope to see much of Britannia restored to its former houseless glory.</p><p><i>Caveats and Questions</i></p><p>One thing you may notice missing from this is that there is no mention of minimum number of people required to own a large building, no mention of fame requirements for castles, and no mention of a limit per account on the number of houses. Any of these things may still be required. We want this solution to be as final as possible, and that means that more severe restrictions may indeed be required than what we are currently planning for. Similarly, you may notice that the previously discussed plans of having marketplaces in towns is not described; this is because we deemed it something that could easily be added later.</p><p>Questions which we would dearly love to see discussion of:<ul><li>Is this plan acceptable to you? (And be sure to check out our poll linked below, to give us feedback on this point!)<li>Is the period of up to a month without vendors going to be too difficult to handle?<li>Do you feel you will have sufficient secure storage after this plan is implemented?<li>Do you feel that this plan will help crowding?<li>How do you feel about the split between public and private buildings? Are we encouraging public buildings too much? Should they have the same maintenance costs as private buildings?<li>Do you hate the idea of maintenance on your house being tied to supply of construction materials?<li>Will you miss tents? If so, why?<li>Is the priority order for claiming houses right? If not, what would you suggest?<li>Is the five tile space required around buildings too much? What would be the optimum space, keeping in mind that restricting the eligible locations for building is a major goal from the dev team's perspective?<li>Was this essay too long? :)</ul></p><p>So there you have it--we'd love to see more comment on this plan, and we'll be monitoring the boards closely for feedback.</p><p>-The UO Dev Team.</p>");</script>

<script>message("Report on Weapons Testing from TC", "<p>Sorry there were no updates today, I've been swamped...I just finished a night of testing weapons on TC and thought I'd pass this along:<h3><center>Weapons Report from TC</center></h3><p>We did quite a bit of tedious testing on TC last night, unfortunately many were getting bored with the typical testing procedures, so after a bit, I just teamed them up and watched them in action.<p>So here are my conclusions.<p>Fencing weapons are looking very good in comparison with all weapons. The weapons are all fairly well balanced with one exception. The short spear showed up as the most potent of the weapons due to it's speed and power...it would outclass all other weapons in its class, vs. the maces, and vs. the swords.<p>The swords weapons are mostly very well balanced. The hally did good damage for it's speed, most of the swords were good tradeoffs for one another. My thoughts are that the broadsword and viking sword are a bit weak (maybe only 3 to 5 hp of damage weak, but nonetheless weak). The axes all were basically similar tradeoffs and I had very few problems with them other than my thinking that they should be upped a couple of points due to their size, they were still just a little off the mark.<p>Maces surprisingly were well balanced as well. I was overly pleased with the war axe and the war maces performance...very competitive. The hammer pick displeased me in terms of damage (it should be upped 3 to 7 hp)...it was too slow to be doing as little damage as it did.<p>Bows are still have the benefit of range...if rubberband lag is gone and the feature with swinging on the run stays with all the melee weapons but bows, then I think that the weapons will be fairly well balanced (though bows still have the upperhand). If I were going to mess with bows, it would be with their damage and not their speed...<p>Overall, fencing got the largest overhaul and it appears that it is the next strong suit in melee fighting. It overpowers swords and maces on most occassions.<p>Swords could be improved, perhaps in the damage to make up for the speed that they lose to fencing weapons, but if it's adjusted, only do so slightly.<p>Maces were very impressive, they deal a decent chunk of damage (could be upped a hair), but what they lose out in speed doesn't bind them to nerfhood as before.<p>I'm surprised that fencing jumped to the top of the melee race and I think the balance isn't with the fencing weapons, but with the swords and maces still being just a tad underpowered in comparison.<p>I am crossing my fingers that the swing while on the run feature stays because it helps balance the weaknesses against archers being able to move and keep distance. I think that it adds a bit of reality as well, swing sword, while running off recock your sword arm and swing again...makes perfect sense.<p>Overall, I'm saying \"Great Job and keep up the work\". The changes look good and things seem to be coming along nicely. Implement the changes I suggested and I think we could be close to all set.<p>Note: The testing procedures required the fighting styles not to vary due to tactics being so varied in the real world of PvP. When used practically in mock PvP battles, things resulted very differently due to fighting styles being able to overcome others. The weapons used were exceptional versions of each type and various armor combinations (most were 30+ due to real world AR current combinations).<p>For those who may wish to read through the testing notes I took, they will be posted below.<p>I'd like to thank everyone from TC who jumped in and helped do some testing. Gerbu, Bon Scott, Viktor, Khadgar, Fenja, Rath, Dracor, Carl, et al (I know I'm forgetting quite a few of you and I'm sorry)...and a special thanks goes out to Faceless and Runesaber for providing me with the ingots to make these weapons with. And to the GMs who kept providing spawns on top of us while we were trying to test, I'd like to say \"Kiss my bootie :P\".</p>");</script>
