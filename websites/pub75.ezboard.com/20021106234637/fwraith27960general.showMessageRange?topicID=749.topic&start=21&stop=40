Does that mean 4 times?  Man I can't even count the number of times we've CR'd people out of fear, gank an epic mob on our way to our target (ie High Scale Kirn in the Hole), or let people grab rotting loot (like the boots from velk on more than one occasion).  To be able to count your positive actions on one hand, might just point out to you that a problem exists.  Maybe not, but its a thought.<br>

I can't condone attempted censorship.  There's been some pretty nasty things said about Aeth on the Aeth boards, none of which have EVER been deleted.  Locked is one thing, the post isn't gone.

Those &quot;respectable people&quot; obviously aren't that respectable if they are telling you false truth.  And yeah, Dominick was there and he saw us do Kland, ask him... <br>
<br>
/who rel = 27<br>
We had 1 recruit.. if my calculations are correct... *skribbles down*.. Oh My God.. 28 people for Klandicar.<br>
<br>
Wanna know how? We use tactics instead of numbers... try it =)<br>
<br>
Thats what RIP is all about.. doing more with less.. you rip on us for failing Yelinak with 30 people.... not only was it our first time doing yelinak.. we didn't know what to expect.. but a friend of mine in who has done yelinak before was calling us crazy for even trying it with what we had.. 30 people.. like 3 clerics... yet in our opinion we did well, and if we would have had the chance to go again, we probably would have won.  Again, we didn't know what exactly we were fighting at first (stats etc..).<br>
<br>
Btw how did it feel for VM to give you guys the same treatment Wraith gave us on Yelinak? Hope it felt good.   You guys sure did well against Tormax for the first time with a guild on your back thats rushing you and threatening to take tormax when you die.<br>
<br>
And another thing.. Yelinak is killable with 25-30... RIP will prove that in time. <p><center>

<br>
First of all, the &quot;censorship&quot; issue.  Desi is 100% correct...this is OUR board.  If YOU decide to leave stupid flames up on YOUR board...grats.  Mindless dribble has no place here, and that's all that most of the posts in this thread are.<br>
<br>
Loganwolf, saying that our guild has no honor and no respect is ignorant.  And could you please stop using those stupid cliches?  They are annoying, much like your trolling here.  If you want to flame us, there are plenty of other sites on which to leave your ramblings.<br>
<br>
Oh, and didn't you, the champion of free speech, tell someone in one of your posts to &quot;shutup&quot;?<br>
<br>
And LOL Vage, &quot;that's not something I can live with&quot;?  Are you gonna call your congressman?<br>
<br>
Sephrok, losing to Tormax was a good learning experience for us, and yes we knew that VM was there if we failed.  Did we cry about it?  No.  Did we whine on boards about it?  No.  We did nothing but try to learn what might help us next time against him.  Oh, and grats on learning to add - that's great.  And your insinuation that we only zerg things is just an ignorant statement.  As far as I can tell, all I can smell that the Sephrok is cooking is bullshit.<br>
<br>
I normally don't respond to these troll posts, but I am sick and tired of people fighting over stupid stuff.  Ketel, the Fayd raid leader gave you an apology for whatever...and many people in the guild have offered to help you guys get the next one, even after you made silly blanket comments about Wraith.<br>
<br>
If you have something constructive to say, post it and you will get intelligent, rational responses.  Post sarcasm and flames and guess what you get?<br>
<br>
Get over it, and get over yourselves.<br>

There arent any in game rules that say you cant do what we did to you guys at yelinak, You should have learned when yall petitioned.

Keep insinuating your better then us or something cuz you kill stuff with low numbers, not to be a cocky bitch normally im pretty humble etc, but look at our recruit boards then look at yours, see a diffrence in the amount of interest in both guilds? just thought i'd humbly point out a simple fact, we have on avg 6-8 recruits on our raids at one time, dont know how many reviv has but theres a couple also. people raid with us  on avg about a month before they get a tag, and sometimes they wont even after a month so if insinuating we ae invite your wrong there cheif <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I do admit however that there needs to be a lvl restriction, sometimes theres alot of people below 58, which is our recruit minimum level. just thought  i'd let you know that so when someday you want to join wraith youll know, :P<br>
&quot;&quot;And another thing.. Yelinak is killable with 25-30... RIP will prove that in time.&quot;&quot;<br>
Yea by guilds that are fully decked in the best gear in the game, i sholdnt have to explain this hehe. Those guilds probably bring a large force of dragonbane wizards as well. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Dont compare our recruits to yours please...  We have very strict recruitment rules cause we want only the best people..  Im not gonna say wraith's recruits are poor but we feel we have all the people we need.. We aren't on Norrath to invite everyone who wants to do big things only what we need...<br>
<br>
and whats wrong with bringing less than 50 people to a raid anyway?  its more fun when you dont gank a mob and use tactics to win.. why should we need 50?  If you want to use more than what other people use.. Fine go ahead I dont care but prepare to take insults from others..<br>
<br>
A post earlier said why should you turn down members cause you have all you need for a certain raid... Well, you shouldn't but there is a time when you should close your own recruitment cause you feel you have enough overall.. Doesnt have to be 30 60 or more but it should be done cause guilds can get grossly big. And then you become one of the drones and no one cares if you show up or not..<br>
<br>
grats on your recent accomplishments and it looks like we will be rivals for days to come.. hopefully everyone remains mature on both sides..  <br>
<br>
I was on the yelinak raid and truthfully I didnt see anything Wraith did wrong.. They waited patiently for us to give a shot then they took theirs... Unfortunately we lost and you won but there will be another day when we perfect our strategy..<br>
<br>
The high end game is cutthroat.. People get into big fights over it.. Guilds crumble and do things they regret.. As I said before I hope everyone keeps a level head instead of childish flames.. <p><center>

B) We have 50 peeps at any given raids cause first off we have TWO guilds at our raids, Wraith and Reviv... second, we are not going to tell ANY high lvl guildie that they cant come cause of number limit, the only thing we can do is put a lvl limit in.  We simply have that many cause we have that many... by no means do we NEED that many.  I mean we killed Yelinak for the FIRST time EVER for us with 2 deaths, 1 being about 2 seconds before Yel fell (and mind you peeps suicide to avoid faction).<br>
<br>
C) A guild can have 100 members there and lose to mobs that a guild with 20 can do if they dont use the proper strat, point is, if you dont have a good strat your numbers will not aid in eliminating the opposition.  If anything it will hurt you with the added lag.<br>
<br>
D) People need to drop the damn &quot;well we're better cause we can do it with less&quot; attitude.  Im glad you can and I appologize for those that say you dont have enough to do it, cause they are wrong.  You will not know until you try.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PS<br>
<br>
on the note that peeps are glad Vis killed Tormax after we failed... honestly grats to them cause we failed so they were not in the wrong at all in taking the spawn... same thing happened at a previous vind/statue raid (although that turned in Wraith's favor)... point is, its part of the high end game competition.  There was once a time we would leave a guild to try again and again until they got it right... well since we were not shown the same respect back we got fed up and said... lets give em a taste of their own medicine, show them we can compete with em to... and thats what we do.  No use whining to everyone about it... its a GAME.  Vis waited for us to fail before they engaged (they did nothing wrong and to that extent showed respect on not straight out KSing us) and we (wraith) allowed Alliance a go at Zlandicar a while back and then with RIP a shot at Yelinak.  We dont just leap frog and KS... if you cant take the pressure I suggest you back down.  Quite frankly there is no room for this complaining BS in my book... This competition is part of the challenge of the game and I for one welcome it.  I dont agree with just leap frogging a guild and taking it but if they were at least allowed one chance then failed... alls fair in war and shit<br>
<br>
<br>
be safe all... OH SHIT.. An_uber_Mob_23 is up, get there before our competition does... WOOHOO<br>
<br>
Let the games begin =P /cheers <p><TABLE WIDTH="450" BORDER="0" BGCLOLOR="black">

Wraith in my experience has always been an honorable guild, with some great people in it, past and present.<br>
You are obviously very mislead, or maybe you just enjoy this backstabbing crap!<br>

Killing yelinak almost flawlessly by zerging you say? hehe. Anyway.<br>
<br>
Some of the folks in Wraith devised and executed strategies since the first kills on Nagafen and Vox on server. You are so preumptuous it's comedic. This is not a newbie bunch. We've built a legacy before, we're building one again. <br>
<br>
Also, you dont know what we can or cant do with fewer ppl. It's that simple. I dont need to prove anything to you guys. Nor should anyone else. When needed we've killed Motg with 5 ppl. <br>
<br>
I dont want to explain the kind of guild we are building. I'm glad you guys are happy with your limited raiding hours and enjoy the repeated learning experiences aka failures. We simply are aiming for something different. <br>
<br>
As for yelinak with 25-30 ppl? Why are you asking/boasting if it's possible. It's been done on all servers. Go take 25 for AoW or something then i'll be impressed. Doing Klan with 28 is no big deal, honest. All of LC / VM / Wraith / Alliance can do it. We have other stuff to worry about, like speed, moving to the next spawn, etc. It's a different mindset. I'm glad you guys are having fun. <br>
<br>
We're not competiing with you, we have other goals.<br>

GMs are humans like the rest of us, they will have biased opinions but they are supposed to have enough self control to not let that interfere with the job they are hired/volenteer to do. <p><TABLE WIDTH="450" BORDER="0" BGCLOLOR="black">

Sephrok-quote<br>
First of all, i didn't bring up the yelinak topic or start whining about it until it was brought up in this post. I am simply backing my guild up.. did i say it was wrong what Wraith did? No it wasn't wrong.. was it bullshit? Yes.. and i'm glad they had the same thing done to them.<br>
And us loosing to yelinak was also a great learning experience, just as you guys to tormax.<br>
<br>
Yes Sephrok i agree it was a learning experience for us on Tormax that was our first time to ever attempt him, as it was for you with Yelinak.  *was it bullshit? Yes..and i am glad they had the same thing done to them*  here i have to disagree with ya, we have other guilds waiting in the wings if we fail a mob to have there go at it....... its just plain old competition, and there isnt much we can do about it on an FFA server.<br>
<br>
I would also like to get away from the we did it with xx people, you did and gratz!  NUFF SAID<br>
<br>
Honestly i dont wish to see any guild fail a mob be it the first time or 50th.  I fully expected Vis to try Tormax after we failed and they did, they won...kudos to them, there WILL be a next time.  I dont feel like it was *taken* from us, we lost its competion and they won.  thats it plain and simple<br>
<br>
Logan im sorry i dont have enough information about fay to know what exactly happened, gimme a /tell in game if you need an extra cleric ill come over and help when ya give it a go.<br>
