We need you to go into the Heart [Consillium] and replace their records with this one. This false record shows that they have completed their Question and still have time until their next one.

I knew that it would take a long time to get planted within Seru, but i still worried about their mission constantly. This report shows that you have earned trust from Euzan, so I in turn will show the same trust. Euzan and Torsten were placed in the city for information. They are deep undercover and risk their life everyday. Every person in that city is ingrained with the [purpose] of either destroying Katta or converting his people.'<br><br>You say, 'what purpose?'<br>Tilbok Furrunner says 'The teaching in the city is that Katta feigned his death to blame it on Seru. When in fact Seru actually poisoned Katta. The crusade that Seru leads is false and must be stopped. We must gain access to Seru's [chambers] and destroy him and show the city the truth.<br>You say, 'what chambers?'<br>Tilbok Furrunner says 'We do not know much about Seru's Chamber, that is what we need you to find out.

Pleasure to meet you, I am Governor Tilbok Furrunner. I am tasked with the gathering and security of information for the Concilium Universus, the ruling council of our fine city. '<br>You say, 'what chambers?'<br>Tilbok Furrunner says 'According to these reports Seru resides in a building called the Arx Seru. It is the large complex in the center of the four Praesertum Consillium. We must take [action] now. Do not underestimate the power of Sanctus Seru for what they do they feel is right. '<br><br>You say, 'what kind of action'<br>Tilbok Furrunner says 'You must go see Lcea. She was Tsaph Katta's closest advisor. This matter has escalated greatly and must be placed in her hands. Ask her about the [Arx Key] she will no doubt ask in your service retrieving it. I salute your service to the city and wish you well. '<br><br>You say, 'what arx key'<br>Lcea Katta says 'The Arx Key, yes. I have read the compiled reports that have been brought to us and it seems to gain access to Arx Seru you need four shards, one from each Praesertum leader. When the time is ready each leader inserts their shard into the door of Arx Seru at the same time, and they are transported within the building. We need you to retrieve the four shards. When you have done so seek out Elnerick Augustleaf, and tell him that you serve Katta. His powers over the arcane are great and I believe he can form the shards into a single master key. Once you have received the Arx Key, place the seal given to you by Elnerick and your Runed earring in this jewel box and give it to me. I eagerly await your return. '<br><br>You say, 'Hail, Elnerick Augustleaf'<br>Elnerick Augustleaf says 'Greetings Moro. I am Magistrate Elnerick Augustleaf of Katta Castellum and the Loyalist Empire. If it is arcane knowledge that you seek you have come to an excellent place to study. Not only do we have wondrous magical resources available at the Magus Conlegium but the teachings of Tsaph Katta are well known to all of our citizens and aid in preparing the mind for the freedom of thought and mental and emotional discipline needed to become a great wizard.

Common hit looks like:<br><br>Your faction standing with Validus Custodus got better.<br>Your faction standing with Katta Castellum Citizens got better.<br>Your faction standing with Magus Conlegium got better.<br>Your faction standing with Nathyn Illuminious got worse.<br>Your faction standing with Coterie of the Eternal Night got worse.<br>Your faction standing with Seru got worse.<br>Your faction standing with Hand of Seru got worse.<br>Your faction standing with Eye of Seru got worse.<br>Your faction standing with Hand Legionnaries got worse.<br><br>Top four are Katta factions; Gaurds, Citizens, Casters, Nathyn. Coterie are vamps in SoL. Last 4 are Seru. I think this is from a turn in. Normal killing in seru will drop you with like 3 factions and raise you with 2 or so. <p><img src="http://members.spinn.net/~paradise/tanise.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm7.showPrevMessage?topicID=70.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm7.showNextMessage?topicID=70.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=70.topic&index=3><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm7.emailToFriend?topicID=70.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm7.threadControl?topicID=70.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm7.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=70.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm7.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=70.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub75.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="trk72095frm1">General<option value="trk72095frm4">Raids<option value="trk72095frm27">Groups<option value="trk72095frm5">Membership<option value="trk72095frm9">Honor list<option value="trk72095frm7">Quests and Tradeskills<option value="trk72095frm8">Wanted items<option value="trk72095frm6">Character updates<option value="trk72095frm2">Members' area<option value="trk72095frm3">Biographies<option value="trk72095frm25">Strategies discussion<option value="trk72095frm10">Items to be given away<option value="trk72095frm11">Items to be claimed<option value="trk72095frm12">Items archive<option value="trk72095frm13">Officer forum<option value="trk72095frm14">Admin<option value="trk72095frm26">FV chapter archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/btrk72095>The Royal Knights</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm7>Quests and Tradeskills</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.theroyalknights.org">The Royal Knights</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
