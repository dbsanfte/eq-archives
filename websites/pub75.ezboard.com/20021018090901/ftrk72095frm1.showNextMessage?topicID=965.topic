Verant/SOE does not want to spend the money for better CS.  Count on it.  I think guides &amp; GMs quit because it is too stressful.  There is no definite hierarchy for issue solution, because rot at the core spreads outward.  The higher ups never planned for CS and the issues that come with MMORPGs.

It's not normal policy to look up soulmarks, however, unless an issue comes up that either requires a soulmark to be placed on the character, such as item reimbursal, or if a disruption is dealt with, in which case, they check soulmarks to see how many disruption offenses there are. <p><center><img src="http://members.cox.net/aurthur/brusig2.jpg"><br><br><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/userinfo.html?char=87761">My Equipment</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CAD5D8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub75.ezboard.com/utonae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tonae</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>peep</span><br>  Posts: 109<br> <font color=#333333>(9/19/02 9:37:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=964.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What Sony Doesn't Want You To Know</span><hr size=1> I tend to agree with the first post more than I do VI's reply.

There are people stuck in walls for hours and days, and that is no laughing matter.  People loosing equipment, bugged corpses, falling to death in zoning, etc.  These are problems that I don't see being addressed.  <br><br>With the money they make off their client base, they could provide each server with a GM..I don't blame the guides for quiting.  They shouldn't have to take the flack from the players because there is no GM available to do the multi-thousand things that the guide cannot do.  Either give the guides more power to handle matters, or get a GM around more often.  We are NOT getting proper CS......When I first started playing EQ little over 1 1/2 years ago, they had better CS than they do now and it seems to be getting worse all the time.
