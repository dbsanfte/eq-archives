The Start<br>
<br>
The Paladin Epic Quest starts out in Erudin where you talk to Reklon Gnallen for the basic quest information. The quest giver is Fetid Fiend Irak Altil, found in Plane of Fear. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what are you mumbling about?'<br>
<br>
Irak will explain that he was betrayed by a Corruptor of Thought and that he was stripped of his armor. You must return his breastplate, sword, and shield to him after cleansing them. <br>
   <br>
 2.  The Breastplate<br>
<br>
The breastplate can be found off of the Thought Destroyer in Plane of Hate. This is a level 55 hag who spawn is triggered by randomly killing other creatures in Plane of Hate. The item is called the Tainted Dark Steel Breastplate. To cleanse this item you must complete a small sub-quest in North Kaladim. Locate Jark in the mines.(p700 x p231), Hail him and say &quot;some.&quot; <br>
<br>
''Huh? Oh, I struck me some silver. Aint gonna make me rich but it'll sure pay for me minin costs. Speakin of, that wife o` mine was supposed ta bring me food already. Hey, you, wanna go get me my dinner? I aint got nothing ta pay ya with but I msure would appreciate it.'' <br>
<br>
You say, &quot;I will get you your dinner.&quot; <br>
<br>
Jark says 'Har, I know you were a good sort. Nella has it. Shes out there somewhere in the lower areas. She likes to visit the temple so maybe shes there. Just tell er Jark sent ya and she'll prolly have everythin ready fer me. <br>
<br>
Go to Nella Stonebraids in front of the temple next to the Pond of Crystal Water.Hail her and say &quot;dinner.&quot; <br>
<br>
Nella Stonebraids says 'Ach! I forgot me husbands dinner. Im so sorry. I was sendin my wishes ta Brell for health and long life. I was just floatin coins into the wishin pool. Usually its for children but things havent been so good lately. Here, please take this to him and tell him where I was. <br>
<br>
Take the dinner that Nella gave you back to Jark. He will thank you and hand you the Gem of Clarity that he just dug up. <br>
   <br>
3.  The Sword<br>
<br>
The Sword is found off of Keeper of the Tombs, a level 51 creature. The spawn time can be 7-10 days long so you will have to do a lot of waiting for this part unless you are lucky. The actual name of the sword is unknown but it should be something like Tainted Sword. The cleansing item for the sword is found from another tiny sub-quest. Find &quot;Peasant Woman&quot; in West Freeport. Hail her and say &quot;I will carry your buckets.&quot; She gives you a bucket to take to her brother, Joshua, who is in the bakery. Give the bucket to Joshua and he will give you a bucket of pure water. <br>
   <br>
4.  The Shield<br>
<br>
The Shield is loot fro Kirak Vil, a level 55 guard in Nektulos. His spawn time is 7-10 days and takes many people to kill because he is absolutely resistant to all spells. You just need a lot of tanks and a lot of clerics. To cleanse this item, hand it to Elia the Pure in Felwithe and she will give you the Gleaming Crested Shield. <br>
   <br>
5.  The End <br>
<br>
Now take the Sword and the Pure Water and give them to Reklon Gnallen, a paladin on the patio of the paladin guild in Erudin. He will give you the Gleaming Crested Sword. Give him the breastplate and the gem and he will give you the Gleaming Breastplate. Now give Reklon the Gleaming Crested Shield, the Gleaming Crested Sword, and the Gleaming Breastplate and he will give you &quot;Mark of Atonement.&quot; He will then say: <br>
<br>
Reklon Gnallen says 'I never thought our order would see these artifacts again. With the return of these relics we can now put at ease a scar upon the history of our order. This cleansing will atone for his failure. Your soul must be pure to have given so freely of yourself. Go now, take this crested token of our order. If you wish to free his soul you must undertake another sacrifice. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What sacrifice' <br>
<br>
Reklon Gnallen says 'Only this crest and the sacrifice of something that symbolizes your strength and purity will release his spirit into the cleansing flames of our lady Quellious. Go now.' <br>
<br>
The crest he speaks of is the Mark of Atonement he just gave you. The symbol of strength and purity is your Fiery Avenger. This is a whole separate quest that is recommended to be completed before you start this one. <br>
<br>
Take the Mark of Atonement and Fiery Avenger to Irak in Plane of Fear. You will then receive the Fiery Defender<br>
