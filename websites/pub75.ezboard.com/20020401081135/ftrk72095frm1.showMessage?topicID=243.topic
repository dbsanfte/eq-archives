But these are the things I noticed:<br>
<br>
1. Not enough 55+ peeps (it looked like we had a lot of peeps but mostly below 55)<br>
2. Main tank needs to tank longer by himself before anyone else even comes in melee range...he (Nascens) had a hard time keeping aggro even chain casting disease cloud, and once Fay started ping ponging most of the melees couldn't hit it for most of the fight, including nascens to try and keep aggro.  It goes without saying that nobody needs to sit for the entire fight, as Fay has a severe dislike for sitting casters.<br>
3. Better FR/MR gear.  Most of the peeps I saw there didn't have any resist gear on.  I didn't think to bring supplies with me but Adj is parked at the island now and has supplies for FR rings and necklaces on her.  Earrings can be bought from the gypsies in LS.  I was chain casting slow and bedlam, never sat down, and never aggro'd him on myself.  I never got a heal but still managed to be one of the last few standing, and finally died to Fay's AE.  I had about 160FR and 200MR for the fight...resisted fear every time.<br>
That's all I could see. <p><center><img src="http://www.theroyalknights.org/sigs/adjsig9.jpg" >

I healed a rogue that somehow got agro with-in the first 10sec after Nasc called the assist, after that I was summoned and pretty much eaten.  Needless to say that was a learning exp for me. I had 150MR and resisted all the fears (that I was alive for) and not sure on the dmg AE as I wasn't watching my life.  <br>
<br>
When doing resists realise they also are effected by what lvl you are.  From lvl 55 to 56 there is a *huge* resist differnce just baist on what lvl you are.  I think I finally get now why on a lot of AE mobs they ask for lvl 55 plus....you just resist a ton more (I noticed it big time when I did sev, first time was lvl 55 and could not stop being feared...lvl 56 feared once and my MR was the same).  So if you are lower then lvl 55 really try to have the high resists even if it means giving up say a bit of other stats. <p><center><img src="http://students.washington.edu/zip/eq/misch.jpg"></center>

Circle and mage DS usually will bring you into a decent range. Sounds to me like the rouge BS'd too soon. Prolly caught aggro then kept it with fresh blood, odd that lash got summoned though normally cele heal generates zero aggro and even Divine is pretty low. Best thing to do if aggro transfers early in a fight is let the person die or stop attacking and back off with a cele on them. I'll be on tonight and we can go give tadpole a smack. <p><img src="http://members.spinn.net/~paradise/tanise.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub75.ezboard.com/unascens.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nascens</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adjani's boytoy</span><br>  Posts: 86<br> <font color=#333333>(10/31/01 3:23:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=243.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What we could've done better at Fay last night</span><hr size=1> Ok, I'm thinking I could have tanked him a little while longer before calling assist.  That may have made a difference but I'm not sure.  I've been able to instantly get a freshly tash/showed mob off an enchanter in HoT at 56 and had no trouble keeping that aggro.  I have also tanked a few times there with no trouble.  So Fay was a little bit of a surprise to me.  I did actually get feared, briefly, near the start and I'm sure that didn't help.  I have 99 MR unbuffed.  Guess it was just my luck.  I kept aggro for a lot of the fight but couldn't seem to get a good grasp on it again.

<br>
I LDed right as Fay was triggered.  Being not in a group, I went to /assist healing.  Lashanna had most the agro.  I tried to heal her, but she had DA casted... Being LD, I missed her calling it.<br>
<br>
So, I continued with the /assist healing.  But, that got me the agro.  I was summoned...  That was the end of me.<br>
<br>
I was told that Fay was ping ponging and was hard to melee.  So, I dont know if anyone was casting that was not in Melee range.  That makes it harder too.<br>
<br>
Tanise is back!  We can do this.  Let me know when we try again.  I will cross my fingers not to LD. <p><center><img src=http://www.jendon.com/sig2a.jpg >

Fay's been buffed btw so he's not such a yutz.<br>
<br>
Was ANYONE sitting post pull? No one should sit period after the hand in. To test this try sitting at the WL when visions pulls tormax...instant death<br>
<br>
How close were peeps? only the MA should be at fay the melee should all be together off one side of him and the casters on another.<br>
<br>
Did peeps nuke from a distance? On all uber mob (ok yeah calling tadpole uber is funny but he is an underestimated mob) battles you should move close for nukes (except for prox aggro mobs like vind and doze) because then if you gain aggro you won't ping pong him around. If a caster draws aggro let them die I realize clerics have difficulty with this but you have to learn to sac people for the good of the fight. Healing at fresh blood with anything but cele is a no no as well. <p><img src="http://members.spinn.net/~paradise/tanise.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub75.ezboard.com/uharrah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Harrah</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>peep</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#333333>(10/31/01 1:31:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=243.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What we could've done better at Fay last night</span><hr size=1> Arrrgh!
