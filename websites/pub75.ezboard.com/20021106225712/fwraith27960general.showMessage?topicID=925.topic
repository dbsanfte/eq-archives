Thin came up and gave us modulation rod (3 charges).  Now i was fighting at time and then i notice my wife died.  I scrolled up and saw what Thin wrote.  Thin says-put it in inventory and right click it 3 times really fast.  Thin also asked which way to NK, i told him north.  When i asked my wife what happened she said that she right click the rod.  It took 300 HP each time and thats a total of 900.  Shes a druid and she died instantly.  This SH*T pissed me off.  I chat with Darlek and he was really helpful about the situation.  He apologized for Thin's action, which wasn't necessary.  He told me that himself and other Officers will chat with him later.  Its people like him that makes me and my wife want to stop playing.  My wife lost her lvl and was really upset and thats why im posting this here.  My wife is a newbe, this is her first character, she dont know what items does what.  When someone come up to you and give you things you assume its good.  Well Thin i hope u got a good laugh from this and if i see your ARSE around i will give you the bird.  I will try to find out how to post what Thin said to us tomorrow when the GM are on.  <br>
<br>
I would like to see some disciplinary action taken on this matter or anything that Wraith feels that they have to do.  Thanks in advance.<br>
<br>
If Wraith wants a second opinion on this matter Sondor will give his.<br>
<br>
any question please email me, if stuffs doesn't make sense im sorry, very tired (    Shatterhandd@msn.com<br>

I am shure the next C3 , RotG , PotG , Aego , VoG , whatever buff from a level 60 will give you far more exp back than you lost from this mod rod .<br>

No she did not get a rez, like i said shes a newbe and looted all (yes i've told before not to loot everything, LOL).  But it was offered by Darlek (i think thats the right spelling) that he would do the rez but was too late.  I dont care about lvl 60 buffs.  Point is she died from Thin's stupid joke.<br>

...I don't expect everyone in Everquest to know everything about each little item.  Wraith, at least I sure as hell hope, is not made up of people whom run around being evil to players.  If that is the case, I'll be letting the door hit me in the ass!  Sorry your wife had this experience (and loss thereof)...  *sigh*<br>
<br>
I'm curious if Thin really meant for her to die...I'm guessing by saying hit it 3/times really fast he did, but I think before we nail him to a cross and cut his nuts off, we should hear from him. *grin* <p><P><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="4">

To recap what he said:<br>
<br>
On an unknown day, I was in South Karana, looking to get to North Karana.  I stopped at spires to give your wife a mod rod, ask for directions and then got off on me killing someone for helping me.<br>
<br>
Firstly, I have no idea why I'm in SK.. in general, I'm doing other things than handing out mod rods in newbie zones.<br>
<br>
Secondly, me asking which way to North Karana from South Karana should be percieved as incredible to most of the people that know me..<br>
<br>
Thirdly, why the HELL do I want to goto North Karana?  From South Karana?<br>
<br>
Fourthly, I've never seen or heard of any of you in my life.  I have a RL friend that has acess to my account, but I'm more prone to doing something like this than he is, and he hasn't been on me in the last two weeks at least.<br>
<br>
Lastly, I think it would be funnier if you just dropped them on the ground, invs, and watched people drop like flys.  It's gimp to have to tell someone to do it.  Watching someone die on their own accord is funny maybe.. but I wouldn't waste my time to tell someone to click it.  That spoils the fun.<br>
<br>
I don't know you, I've never interacted with you, I've had no one tell me of this thread, and no officer has talked to me.  I think it's obvious you're out to start @#%$ with me for some reason.  Talk to me in game, I'm on like everysinglemomentoftheday, and would lovve to hear from you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/uepicureofquellious.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EpicureOfQuellious</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Reviv Officer</span><br> <font color=#0000FF>(7/24/02 5:47:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/fwraith27960general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=925.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Thin</span><hr size=1> If it was that bif of an issue to the poster he would have posted a screenshot or at least a log.<br>

If he's not even pissed enough to post either to give his story (which is full of unlikely circumstances and inconsistancies) an ounce of credit ... then I have to take this as a joke post looking to spark up some action into somones dull life.<br>

Rereading his post and follow up posts I still maintain that this is a big pile of bunk.<br>

<br>
I can answer my own questions for you now..<br>
<br>
- This was two days ago<br>
<br>
1- I was in SK to do something for Fifity's rangers epic<br>
<br>
2- That wasn't me playing .. and this isn't exactly his brightest moment for not being able to find his way from SK to NK...<br>
<br>
3- Again, I was doing some part of the ranger epic for a friend<br>
<br>
4- My friend was on me two days ago, another friend needed help with something so he went ahead and helped him.  He also went to the arena brawl in bazaar afterwards also for all the people that probably killed me heh.  Still pissed at him for not saying it wasn't me.  He said he didn't because the thought it was funny.. which pisses me off even more.<br>
<br>
I truly am sorry this happened to you, but you are totally blowing this the hell out of proportion.  The way you've went about this is totally untactful, and easily give the impression of a personal attack on me for performing something she asked for, Mr. Thanks in Advance.<br>
<br>
She knew I was a mage because he had a pet up (He was killing the horse men..) - I was roleplaying.. and if anything I look like a ghetto chanter with my mod rod in my hand.  She asked for something summoned, and he gave her a mod rod.  He said you could click it up to three times as fast as you wanted.<br>
<br>
A cautious player, which that doesn't enjoying dying, and losing their level, would get an intimation of what their getting into before going full-blown I'll click this as fast as I can as many times as I can just because I can (even though I don't know what it does).  I'm sorry you died, my friend is sorry you died, I hope you learned from the mistake.  You were NOT told to do it, and even if you were, WHY would you bitch about how you think someone else got you killed?  Giving a druid with regen and decent heals a mod rod to try to do something nice is perfectly acceptable, especially after she asked for something summoned!!  She even almost lived through all three clicks of it, newbie my ass.  If you were too tired to make an explicable post, and moderately coherent; I would urge you to wait until another time.<br>
<br>
My friend said he made a comment on it in guild, and to a few people in tells right after it happened.  It did happen, my character did do it, and me denying that it happened would just be plain idiocy, and that's the purpose of this post.<br>
<br>
You bringing this here, after being met by receptive ears of your concerns by other members, leaves me with a very reserved amount of respect for you, as a person.  Talk to me in game if you want a reply. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ushatterhandd77.showPublicProfile?language=EN>shatterhandd77</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#0000FF>(7/25/02 9:04:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/fwraith27960general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=925.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Thin</span><hr size=1> Thin,<br>
<br>
Like you said you don't know me or interact with me ever before.  I never seen you or talk to you either untill that night.  Im not here to give you Sh*T but i want to get my point across for what you (or your friend) did.  Giving mod rod to newbie and watch them die.  I manage to get a few screen shots.  The most important one is when Thin tells my wife to put it in the inventory slot and click it 3 times really fast, but your friend is saying you can click it up to 3 times.  Another is how he said that he thought she has enough HP and said its not his fault.  Once i get the screen shots up here you and others can make the decision.  Oh, my wife never asked him for the mod rod!  Tell your friend to stop lying (or you stop lying).  I would like to see him post that here that says my wife wants a mod rod.  I tried to talked to Thin when i finished the fight but he won't respond to me (Rrarna) but when my wife send him a tell he said that he thought she had enough HP and that its not his fault.  I even told Sondor (my online friend) about this and he talked to some peeps trying to help me deal with the situation.  Sondor said that Thin is a KID so i said that don't justify his actions for what he did.  He /agree.  If you happen to see Sondor on line ask him about this.<br>

If you are attempting to have a matter resolved, this is most certainly not the way to get it done efficiently, nor effectively.<br>
<br>
No one can force anyone to do anything in this game.  Your wife clicked the mod rod, I think you should be explaining to her to be more cautious.  Some people just need to learn that they are responsible for their own actions, and should not have to blame other people for their own mistakes. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=2248" target="_blank">

Passionate I must sincerely disagree with yoru assertions. <br>
<br>
The fact that Thin is even apologizing should be enough to close the matter. I don't know what more this guy wants? Us to PL his wife or something. There will not be any &quot;disciplinary&quot; action. I consider these harmless pranks. Thin can remember this incident and choose to make better judgements next time I gues.<br>
<br>
Asking someone to mod rod, cohing ppl over lava pits, incorrect directions, incorrect price info, incorrect mob info, incorrect faction info. These are all harmless pranks. <br>
<br>
Granted most people are willing to think with a more open mind and are able to laugh at themselves. All of these pranks have been pulled on me by strangers at various points, levels and places and I was amused by my own carelessness. It's a game. Get on with it.<br>
