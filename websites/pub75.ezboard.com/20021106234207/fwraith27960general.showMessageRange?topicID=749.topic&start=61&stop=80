<br>
     A lot of our members take pride in what we do with less.. As I said before its not a lack of recruits.. We like what we do and how much we do it with. A lot of people were offended when someone earlier &quot;a respectable source said we did not do Klandicar with the numbers we stated&quot;.  We most certain did it with those numbers.. We don't lie to prove points and we are proud of it.. <br>
<br>
     Its not right for people to go around saying &quot;we do things with 20 people less than you do so we are better&quot;. But then again its not right to go around saying we can kill all these things and you can't.. Both our guilds are at fault here... <br>
<br>
     I know all the people in Rel and will defend every one of them vehemently(sp?).. They are all good people who work hard to do the things we do.. Sometimes they may do or say things outsiders may not like but they all mean well. I'm sure there are people in Wraith who haven't said good things about Rel either. <br>
<br>
     To me a zerg guild is a guild that uses shady tactics to win a battle aka res mid battle or bring an ungodly amount of people to a raid cause they know they can't win... Wraith had 50 people to the yelinak raid and how many died 4?  That seems rather good to me.. No res rush just a beat down. <br>
<br>
     Next time why dont we use diplomacy instead of childish flames, so we can all have fun in what we do.  Guild managements need to work with each other to resolve a compromise.  <br>
<br>
So don't loom over our shoulders next time we do a raid waiting for us to die ok?  <br>
<br>
There are things we dont need when playing a game we all love.<br>
<br>
Biggy is right I dont think we would handle a conflict very well.  I just want to go on and kill things.. I like competition as long as its fair and just. You go do your things and we will do ours.<br>
<br>
Dont judge guilds on the actions of a few.. Judge guilds on the actions of a whole. <p><center>

<br>
We had enough to kill Yelinak but we were over-run.. that logic is kinda flawed.  Who judges if someone doesn't have enough or not? Do you plan on overruning us (or others) everytime you *think* a raid doesn't have enough to succeed?<br>
<br>
I dont know if thats exactly what you meant, maybe i interpreted it wrong, and correct me if I did.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
For the most part I actualy agree with what Gaethan says for once =p<br>
<br>
I am going to take the initiative to apologize for the assumption that Wraith is a zerg guild.  That was wrong for me (and us) to say, and it was probably said out of anger.. (you may call someone your angry at a &quot;fag&quot; IRL or somethin, well thats the same way we used &quot;zergling guild&quot; =p)... but do we have a right to be angry?  I think we do, with the 'threats' i received in tells, degrading myself and my guild, right before our run at Yelinak... the issue isn't whether we got Yelinak or not.. its whether there is some common curtesy when there is clearly a raid there before you.. if we (RIP) know of a raid forming up somewhere, then we aren't going to try and form up behind them, pray they loose, and threaten them in tells... but thats just us i guess.<br>
<br>
The fact that you formed up behind us to take yelinak wasn't wrong, it was a lack of respect, and were the tells i recieved supposed to be part of the competition package?<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to flame wraith in this post, i'm just trying to get my point across why exactly *I* am  angered / disgusted.  If for some reason this comes across as a flame.. well.. re-read through it.. pretend i'm smiling while I typed this, then it'll seem alot happier =p <p><center>

Gaethon. I dont know how much you value my opinion. But it's ALWAYS more beneficial to take a more objective approach then this, even if you act so in private.<br>
<br>
And it's easy to say &quot;Take the actions of the whole not the individual&quot; when you know there are individuals from your side who are blatantly at fault. Do you understand that guilds as a whole will never be wrong? It's always individuals who make mistakes, whether they be the raid leaders or some random idiots with poor judgement making an inflammatory post on another guild's site.  <br>
<br>
I would have had hope that the individual &quot;bythespirit &quot; or whatever would be reprimanded but Sephrok makes posts in similar vein on this site and other boards, so I really have little reason to expect any action to be taken.<br>

When Yelinak was up, it was never anyone’s intention to override another raid.  What happens is this…<br>
We see someone say in our joint chat that Yelinak is up!  A question is asked if there is any other guild taking him.  The person sees that there is no guild in force to go after him.  The answer is no, it doesn’t look like it.  Then an announcement is made for everyone get to Skyshrine.  Yes, maybe there are members of other guilds in the zone, but no force.  So off we run, from all the corners of Norrath and the moon. <br>
15 or 30 minutes as people start coming, someone notices a few RiP members starting to enter the zone.  Then a call is made to hurry up, another guild might also be going after him. <br>
It is not our fault that there are over 2 thousand players on Quellious.  Its not our fault that there are only a few mobs that pop that offer the kind of risk/reward we are after.  It is something we all have to live with.  It’s a game.  Part of the game is a competition to get to high risk/reward mobs first.<br>
We were all told that we would give RiP the first try and only go after Yelinak if they lost.  We all knew this and most of us were content with the decision.  I don’t know what tells you got from individuals, but as a whole, Wraith and Reviv were aware of the agreement and we had no complaints.<br>
When the shout came for everyone to come to Kael, for Tomax, we also were not aware that Vis would be entering the zone.  They started coming as we came.  They gave us first shot.  We lost.  I have no hard feelings that Vis pulled him next and won.  We have more to learn on pulling Tormax.  I have complete faith that we will get him in the future.<br>
My point is, that in the future, when we see targets up and go after them, we aren’t doing it to KS anyone.  We are going after the target because we have been wanted to take this target for some time.  There are many times when we have been called to go after some mob and 15 or 30 minutes after the call, when I am almost there, an announcement is made that so and so guild is getting him.  Don’t bother coming, they have the force and we don’t.  We grumble and move on.  We sometimes go and try another target that no one else has taken yet.<br>
We are going to see this again.  There will be more ties.  If there is more then one guild in force, we are going to have to take turns on the target mob.  This will only make the risk higher.  If you fail, then you must give the other group or guild a chance.  You may not want to, but they will take it if you don’t.  Be aware of this and keep up good sportsmanship.  I will congratulate you for winning where we lost.  It’s a game.  Play hard and have fun!  <br>

Someone talks of respect amd to me the respect is that no matter who gets that first shot, you let them have it. You do not force their pull, you do not pull mobs through their camp to pass the time, you do not spam people with threats or tells just cause you bored. The respect comes from sitting back and waiting, let the ones who are there take their shot then if they do fail when given a fair shot respect dictates that you should back off and let them try and not rush their pull. I think that many on the server haved started to follow this and that is good. And in EVERY guild there are the few shall we call them bad apples, you know the ones who want to pull the mob erly to mess them up so can take the shot, will cause trains through pullers or camps, who will send rude and anoying tells to people or over shouts. We all have people like that in guild and sometimes even the quiet one in the corner snaps and does somethuing stupid like that, the thing is we should all realize that guilds are groups of people and one or two people should not be the judgement of the entire guild. PRobably just rambling again but the things is do not judge any guild by a few of their members but insted look at the person. That and to be honest what does all this flameing do especialy when you have no marshmellons to roast over them.<br>

<br>
If I feel Wraith or any other guild does something wrong that warrants a post on a board. I will do it.. I guess Loganwolf felt that way too.  Its better to talk about the issue then dismiss it from the beginning cause I'm very much sure Wraith doesn't want a bad rep.. Some bad things are inevitible but as long as they are in the spirit of competition I dont mind.<br>
<br>
I personally like competition it will make all of us better as long as its fair..<br>
<br>
oh and I value everyone's opinion whether its right or wrong.<br>

NEVER.  When you had 2 in zone we had 10, when you had 10 we had 25.  They only reason you even beat us back to his lair was that you are not KOS so you ran there while we had to COTH our people.  We had 50 people there by the time you had 25, and we stood way back in that corner and let you guys have a good attempt.  We were buffed and rdy to go long before you attacked, but we sat in that corner out of respect and let you guys buff and get your strategy together.  We didn't get in your way or do anything to hurt your raid, but damned if we were gonna wait 3 hours for you guys to get more people there while we had a full raid force there already.  <br>
<br>
You went, you lost, and we killed him.  That seems fair to me.  It's not like we did /w Rel and ran there because we knew Yelinak was up and ran past you.  Desaran checked him the exact same time as Sephrok did, and both guilds started moving there at the same time.  We never at any time tried to run past you guys even though we had more than enough people and wanted to rush him.  But then when you lost you guys stood in the doorway as not to let us group and charge, even after being asked to move.  Finally someone in your guild musta said something because people got out of the way.  Two guilds noticed Yelinak up at the same time, and we had the force there first to kill him.  Ask a GM, that is not against the rules, nor were we in the wrong.  I guarantee certain other guilds woulda just charged right past you, but we didn't.  We waited to see if you won or not.  If we wanted to we could have ran in and killed him once we were buffed with you guys standing there, but that's not how we are.  We sat there fully buffed for 30-45 minutes before you guys even attacked.  GMs have told us many times that the first group there with enough to kill the mob can engage it, not the first group with 1 person there calling camp on it.  And we have sat and watched other guilds rush right by us with no respect that we were there first or cleared to the mob.<br>
<br>
As far as us being a zergling guild, there are times where I am disgusted by how many people we have at a raid.  Kinda takes the fun out of killing Cazic when 72 people show up for the raid.  But what do you do, start telling people they can't come?  When a raid is called, we go whether we have 25 people or 55.  We killed Yelinak with 52 people and 2 deaths, Leetah and Rumuk.  If that's considered zerging, so be it.  The raid was called, and we were attempting Yelinak whether we had 30 people or 70.  You never know how many are gonna show up.  But it's not fair to tell people they can't come because we took the first 35 people there and 35 was the max number for this mob.  Whomever is there by the time we engage the mob is welcome on the raid, although at times it gets to be a bit too many.  And there are other times where we will kill something with 30 people just because that's all that showed up.  You make due with what you have, just as Rel did with Yelinak the other day.  Congrats on killing him with 38.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

But the majority of Wraith is good peoples.  We ain't out to screw any other guild over, even though it has been done to us multiple times out of greed by other groups.  We're out here trying to have fun, just like the rest of you guys.  And to see all this hatred towards us, I just don't get it. <p><BR><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=130644"><font color=orange>Baroness Ittee Bittee 60 GNOME Assassin</font></a href><BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=130618"><font color=orange>Baroness Aguilera Angelheart 60 Hierophant</font></a href><BR><center><BR><a href="http://www.wraithguild.com"><font color=red>Wraith</font></a href></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub27.ezboard.com/ugaelron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gaelron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#0000FF>(4/3/02 11:52:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/fwraith27960general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=749.topic&index=77>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Locking the Post is as good as Removing it.</span><hr size=1> I wasnt there at the beginning of yelinak so i didnt see how it all started but the things I didnt like was you sat in our line of sight and lagged us to death then asked us to move as we were ressing.. <br>
<br>
But as I said Wraith did nothing wrong in my book and We know Wraith is generally good people no one has said any different.<br>

After we died, we were able to ress up, rebuff, and could have went in for another attempt before you guys did your attempt / killed him.<br>
<br>
&quot;You went, you lost, and we killed him. That seems fair to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Thats completely fair to me.. what i didn't like are the rude comments from good ol' Biffins (played by desi i assumed) and Feira(sp? some 59 war vah shir).  Hey Droz, tell me how you would feel if you have someone from RIP /t'ing you dis'ing your leadership and everyone in your guild... that'd give you a reason to be mad wouldn't it?<br>
<br>
&quot;you guys never at any time had enough to kill him. NEVER.&quot;<br>
&quot;but damned if we were gonna wait 3 hours for you guys to get more people there while we had a full raid force there already.&quot;<br>
<br>
Our 30 people was our full force, who determines how many you need to kill a mob? We had enough and could have done it would we have been given a 2nd chance.. we didn't know exactly what we were up against at first, being our very first time w/ yelinak. (Wraith at the least knew his stats etc from when Old-Wraith attempted him..) We had him down to 70% w/ hardly any problems, then levi wore off on a focus and it went down hill from there.<br>
<br>
&quot;But then when you lost you guys stood in the doorway as not to let us group and charge, even after being asked to move.&quot;<br>
<br>
Biffins was sending me smart ass tells to move, i sent him smart ass tells back, he said &quot;Fine stay there then and eat the AEs&quot;.  Once Droze asked me nicely to move the raid, I did move them.<br>
