<br>
Well i replied i am not hanging on anymore, I am sorry I just have had it. In 5 months of hanging around with you guys I am sure i have proven to be more than worthy a member of the guild, i did not miss a single raid in the first 2 months i starting hanging on with wraith. I have spent all my cash on getting resistance gear and i had also asked help to Raluvin to help me buy stuff and now i am 5k in bedit with ral, anyway i got my resistance well over the required.<br>
But still that was not enough iether. When i at last managed to get some knowledge of why i was not guild invite i was asked to level and at least hit 56, than the joinining requirements where made 57 and changed again to 58 and lastly i was told to hit 58 to join.<br>
<br>
So makeing my time and proving and working my ass to proven i can play better even at the lvl i was was useless and waist of time, My time Raiding my dedication to be on time and to be on every raid  was no even considered, and as you all know i never complained and hardly asked for buffs.<br>
If my level was a problem as you said on certion mobs than i ask you how was i one of the few that would revive almost all the raids?<br>
<br>
Well to close my finial desiction to post here about this great disappointmnet on the last raids loot was given to members of Revivion who join us in the raid, but as I am so called in recriuting guild we are not entitled to any loot, and after 5 months of hard work i did i find that very very heath breaking and unfair.<br>
<br>
I am sorry but i lost all interest in wraith, even with the problems it has i would have stayed if my time was proven worthy of something.<br>
<br>
Finaly, I am not a selfish person, I want to thank you for letting me on the raids and thanking me to TOV, NP and killing that evil one eye mean Dorf in icewell and killing the statue of Zek  and all.<br>
<br>
God Bless <br>

Trex, <br>
<br>
I dont even know if it's worth it to respond to your points but i'll try to do so and keep it very brief. <br>
<br>
You said that for the first 2 months you didnt miss a single raid. And that is far from true. You might have managed to make any raid you possibly could but in the end you were far too inactive to really register. And the grim reality is some classes need to work harder than others since they are not critical classes. At that point we had lots of paladins (though Hakaff and Wyldfyst later left) but still you were basically attending a raid here and there.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry you had to take loans to buy resist jewellry but it's not like we take your resist gear. You've kept it and will benefit from it in future. Without the resist gear you'd be unnecessarily dying and getting rezzed all the time. It's necessary for the high end game you strived for.<br>
<br>
About the lvls. Yes they used to be 55 when you STARTED recruiting. Other palys Yezud etc were 56 and managed to join with active raiding. You were raiding very infrequently, and then disappeared for a 4-5 weeks and then came back and started raiding again, and i'm sorry you were treated as a new recruiti all over gaian but seriously, our req had been raised by then and you never really registerered in the first place. Tanithelas, another paly, etc also were inducted at lev 57. No special favors were being given.<br>
<br>
Attending 1-2 raids in a week we raid everyday and multiple times a day, and doing that for 2 months, gives a skewed impression of &quot;I've been raiding 2 months with you folks&quot; I always told you to attend more raids. It might be the best you can do, then Wraith wasnt the right fit for you ever. We always made it clear we are here to raid and though you were very nice it's just that your lev / class / and relative inactivity just never had the right mix.<br>
<br>
As for Revivisence, there were our allies. Everything else I can explain calmly, but this irritates me a little. We had an officer award loot system. And basically ANYTIME that you EXPECT to receive a item that dropped, you are already out of line. Those guys more than deserved what they got. And you were ALWAYS reminded that as a recruit you will not be awarded loot that our members need, and our allies were treated as members as we had promised them.<br>
<br>
I never said you were a selfish person, but I really dont appreciate you coming and flaming us (it doesnt matter if you dont use curse words, it's still a flame) on these boards, laying down only half the facts and complaining about loot. Though I sympathized with your efforts to join the guild and always explained to you the reasons you couldnt be inducted yet, this method of parting certainly leaves a sour taste in my mouth.<br>
<br>
Good luck in your future endeavors and good day<br>
<br>

<br>
As for my 3 -4 week absonse yes i was not raidiing simply casue i was working on leveling in which time from 53 i made my way to 56. <br>
<br>
for the rest i dont want to argue , maybe i could not attand all the raids yeah i am European and 6 - 9 hours ahead of most of you so yes some raids i was not there and its understandable why i was not there. <br>
<br>
But for the raids i came and spent time with you guys again i say Thank you for the fun we head, My big dissappointment was as you said some classes are not critical but there we thank verent for creating a Warrior/Cleric/Enchanter game making some classes almost useless. <br>
Well all out and thank you please dont say you got a soure taste in your mouth when i mean no flaming, after all this is a game<br>
