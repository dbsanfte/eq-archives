Heh, yup. Watching my friends suffering with the latest patch nerfs or more net congestion gives me this o-so-relaxed feeling when I realize it ain't my problem. So does not putting up with general in-game BS.<br>
<br>
BTW, I'd never read the Cantus board before. Man, they make Dofler look well adjusted. ;P (I notice you're starting to revert to signing stuff with yer real name Dof).<br>

Naw. I bought the monkey for people who are too pathetic for me to waste time throwing my own feces at them. Shall I have you put on the monkey's schedule for next Wednesday?<br>
<br>
By the way, I paid good money for that monkey. When he's over at your place again, kindly remember he is not one of your &quot;inflatable love partners&quot;. And if you simply can't resist his simian charms again, at least be safe. I don't want him picking up any more diseases from you--the vet bill wasn't cheap.<br>
<br>
(Actually the quote was intended to tie in with your post on the Cantus board responding to Saskin. 'Twas a good quote. But I forgot that you were in college, where short term memory doesn't last any longer than the space between weekend parties. Ah, college... Hrm, what was I talking about? )<br>
<br>
--- On a serious note, responding to Smidget: Yeah, I think I'll be back eventually. I'm starting to think more about the good things in EQ these days. But I'm still not ready yet. And I'm having a ton of fun these days with other games (Crazy Taxi, Nox, actually playing a bit of paper and pencil D&amp;D believe it or not. Woo, old school). But I do miss you guys (yes,  even ol' dogface Dofler).<br>
<br>
Well, bye for now. Must go play Crazy Taxi until thumbs bleed... Zyxion &quot;Gnome Power&quot; Jonkers.<br>

Re: reading posts while im not playingq<br>

Gah, that's the second weak comeback in a row Dof. I'm starting to worry about you. Is everything ok? You getting enough vitamins? And George Carlin? Ack, he went out with Reaganomics and Generra clothing!<br>
<br>
But sure, I can do putdowns at a Carlin level. Umm, Your mama's like a bus stop. People getting on and off of her all day long. Bwahahahaha...ha...ugh. No wait, I can do this. Next I give an amusing tale about my childhood in the Irish ghetto, or a little vignette about dope smoking. Haha, quality Carlin....ugh, ouch, ack! Head hurts! Mind warping! O no, I'm starting to think it would be really cool to start a halfling druid and power kite to level 50! Aieeee!!! *Zyxion douses himself with ice water*<br>
<br>
Ahh, much better. My brain is functioning above the trailer-park-living-six-pack-guzzling-hamburger-helper-eating level again. I'm can once more see the obvious superiority of Gnomes over woodchip eating halflings. (Well, all races really, but I hate to give them a complex).<br>

*Scene opens to our hero Zyxion sitting in front of his computer--yes, Gnomes are already far ahead of the rest of Norrath technology-wise. He's currently reading an artistic black hole that poses as a poem.*<br>
<br>
&quot;Ugh. Multiple grammatical errors, stilted cadence, broken rhythm--'New Yorker' material it's not. Hell, this isn't even in the same league as &quot;Piss Christ&quot; or Annie Sprinkle tours. Kind of ironic that it's supposed to demonstrate superiority over Gnomes. Ah well, it did come from a halfling...&quot;<br>
<br>
*As Zyxion begins to move to the next message, a sudden flash of inspiration strikes him. Being a Gnome, and used to brilliant ideas, he wastes no time in acting on it.*<br>
<br>
&quot;Heck, I know who would be interested in this tripe. In fact, he's looking for people of this quality!&quot;<br>
<br>
*Zyxion puts on some gloves and picks up the phone*<br>
<br>
&quot;Manny, get me Regis Philben.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, I know. You can disinfect the phone later.&quot;<br>
<br>
*Zyx waits a few seconds, then Regis is on the other end*<br>
<br>
&quot;Reege! Zyx here. No, no. Still not interested in doing the talk show. You know how I feel about Kathy Lee. That whole underground sweat shop empire unnerves me.&quot;<br>
&quot;Heh, let's not get started on Kathy Lee bashing. Anyway, what I called to talk about was this: I think I've got a perfect contestant for 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire' &quot;<br>
&quot;Some background? Well, he's a halfling.&quot;<br>
&quot;Hrm, well, think of Tatoo from Fantasy Island except for pudgier and with really huge, smelly, hairy feet.&quot;<br>
&quot;Hairier than that.&quot;<br>
&quot;Hairier than that.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah, European girl with a Chia pet in a headlock. Mix in some limburger and you've got about the right mental picture.&quot;<br>
&quot;What does he do? Well, he goes to one of those eastern seaboard colleges where your GPA is directly related to your blood alcohol content. He also drinks a lot of bong water and licks himself. Oh, and he can turn into a dog.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah the dog part explains the licking thing. You don't sound real interested...&quot;<br>
&quot;You're not sure he's stupid enough? Hah, this guy is overqualified for even your show when it comes to the ol' dim bulb factor. Just listen to this gem:&quot;<br>
<br>
*Zyxion reads the (ahem) poem.*<br>
<br>
&quot;Hehe, was I right or was I right? You can't get nastier shit from a diarrhetic wombat!&quot;<br>
&quot;You're worried about him drooling etc.? But all your contestants drool!&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh, the dog thing. Well, just get him something to keep him occupied. Anything that looks remotely like Leonardo DiCaprio he'll pretty much hump non-stop.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, no, my pleasure. Say 'Hi' to Joy and Letterman for me. Take it easy.&quot;<br>
<br>
*Zyxion places the phone back in its cradle. He then goes and burns the gloves. Scene closes*<br>
<br>
Ah, Dofler such wonderful times await you. Wherever people marry their relatives, wherever families have been living on toxic waste dumps for multiple generations, wherever stupidity exists in our world, your face will flicker into those living rooms.<br>
<br>
And you will be their hero--nay, their god. Then you can spend your winnings on kibble, cheap malt liquor and the 'Elect Snoop Doggy Dog President fund', just like you've always dreamed of.<br>
<br>
I feel glad now, Dofler is with his people. Run free, little Dofler! I've done my good deed for the day...<br>
