<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Go to the Coterie castle in Tenebrous Mts. On the second floor is a winged Coterie named Renaldok Masric. Hail him<br>
<br>
Renaldok Masric says 'Greetings mortal. The aura of death that surrounds you is the only reason you are not already a feast for my minions. Have you come to me as a sacrifice or are you offering your [services] to the Coterie of the Eternal Night? <br>
<br>
You say, 'I am offering my services.' <br>
<br>
Renaldok Masric says 'If you are powerful enough to be of use to me you will journey to the Twilight regions on the south side of Luclin and fill this wineskin with the blood of the Akheva. Failure is final death, either at the hands of the Akheva or the hands of the Coterie. <br>
<br>
<br>
Akheva blood drops off of Xin Thall in Maidens Eye and prob in Akheva as well. The blood is tradeable so you can auction for it as well. Once you have 4 vials of blood put them into the skin Renaldok Masric gave you and combine. Give the new skin back to him and he gives you this:<br>

The Mask is right clickable. The casting time is 1.7 sec which is .2 seconds longer then the spell BUT unlike the spell it can be recast instantly. A very nice item I think. Frees up a spell slot and i dont have to wait 10 sec for it to repop.<br>

<br>
I get these blood things needed for the quest. I keep them atm. I don't recall if they are no drop... if they aren't, anyone who wants, just let me know. If they are no drop, you folks are welcome to stop by and hlep me kill them /nod<br>
<br>
The mobs are Xin whatever (4 arms), and the shadow types (2 Xi **** names). From extensive testing, Xin are harder in general, and male. Xi are female, and die easier. ALL mob names can be SK or Cleric.  They can all range from 51 to 58. None summon. I have solo'd ALL types, ALL levels, by root/dotting. The only one I had a problem with was a Xin that was 58 _and_ had the rare drop wis melee belt ... This mob I did solo, but had to repeatedly cast all spells, and root lasted on average 5 seconds ... I used 20 mana trying to just /stick/ one root, also. Mobs having the more common belt were no problem.<br>
The SK mobs will HT. The Xin cleric mobs will HT (all Xin HT basically. 900 odd). Any cleric of sufficient level will, if mana is not used nuking you, CHeal. This is ok, just don't try and kill too quick, wait for them to do the 500 nuke about 4 times /nod (after the 900 HT).<br>
<br>
Drops from these mobs are SK/ranger/pally spells, the belts mentioned above, all the &quot;shaded&quot; armor items (suggest they are for a quest of some sort really), rarely most other zone drops (weapons). The medallion thingy. A caster Shield with decent AC but not much else. Lots of the drops from these mobs are no drop. The lump of shadow things for the faction quest next door also are common, no rent.<br>
neg faction with Akheva.<br>
<br>
Personally, at Umbral zone, I harmony pull the 3 statics at the entrance/exit area. If I kill those 3 and have mana, I pull a roamer. I _always_ use anull to pull to remove clr buffs like HB, and then snare main mob. If mob has a pet, root, snare. Back to main mob and root - keep ALL mobs close to the umbral zone area, not in the larger area as pathing bugs can cause the roamers outside to aggro in to here (you will know when they HT you from nowhere). Common roamer aggro would be an animal type mob (shadow wolf / ravenous beast), uncommon would be a Xi*.<br>
<br>
Mobs resist snare maybe 1 in 100 casts, root maybe 1 in 20. Level of mob has lots to do with this, but you can't easily tell before the pull. Xin are more MR overall.<br>
<br>
Charmed aminals (that roam in or get lured in by sneaky tricks with invis) ..... shadow wolf mob is low hp compared, and low damage. A shadow wolf will die at about 50% of a Xin's health. It might last a Xi fight, depending on levels. A ravenous beast will sometimes be too high for druid charm to work at all, but rarely. Good xp if it is anyhow. Ravenous will kill a Xi mob, and might last thru an Xin mob, depending on Xin level and damage you do.<br>

Journey to THE GREY, while you are there pick up three no drop Shissar Organs, take them to the City of Katta Castellum and turn them in to Drenic Garrison, his location is 277.99, 34.40, 2.50. <br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Drenic Garrison'<br>
<br>
Drenic Garrison says <br>
'Greetings Henan! I am Drenic Garrison, Governor of Science here in Katta Castellum. I am currently involved in several scientific endeavors with the other governors and am in need of assistance supplying my researchers with the proper [materials and samples] for their studies. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What materials and samples?'<br>
<br>
Drenic Garrison says <br>
'The Magus Conlegium are assisting with some studies on the physiology of the Vampyres of the Coterie of the Eternal Night and are in need of [ash and blood] samples. Maralicis Dilsm our Governor of Health is assisting in research on [counteragents] to the venom and diseases native to Luclin. Finally, there have been reports from the agents of Erikal Wolfeye that there is a civilization of [snake people] that live on the furthest reaches of the light side of Luclin in a region devoid of atmosphere. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What snake people?'<br>
<br>
Drenic Garrison says <br>
'To the west beyond the Twilight Sea is an airless grey region between the light and dark sides of Luclin. Some time ago our scouts cooperating with powerful members of the Magus Conlegium attempted to chart the expanses of the barren treacherous region. During this excursion the scouts and magi encountered a small group of strange snake like men. The magi detected no magical aid that was allowing the creatures to move freely in the airless void without danger of suffocation. When approached the snake men quickly fled. We wish to know how these creatures survive in such conditions. If they prove to be a hostile species then we will have to resort to examining their [anatomy]. <br>
<br>
You say, 'I will help you with their anatomy'<br>
<br>
Drenic Garrison says 'I wish to examine the lungs or whatever breathing organs these creature have. It would not be prudent to hunt and kill a living member of this species and society we know practically nothing about but there are several undead snake men in the region as well. I will require three such organs however to perform the proper experiments. <br>
<br>
Drenic Garrison says <br>
'I require three organs from the snake people. <br>
<br>
Drenic Garrison says <br>
'Excellent work Henan! The acquisition of these organs is a fantastic accomplishment! <br>

It was pretty easy considering the reward and only took a couple hours.  <br>
<br>
I got the Perfect Owlbear Pelt off of an Owlbear Cub in the Paludal Caverns, approx loc (-2000, -500).  The Grimling Runner, which seems to be the bottle neck paths past the cave in the Tenebrous Mountains that leads to the Grimling Forest.  So if he isn't camped by a tracking class this might be the best place for you non trackers to wait for him.  I got lucky and he ran up and attacked my pet about 3 minutes after I zoned in.<br>

<br>
Rallic Pack<br>
<br>
This quest produces a lore 10-slot, 85% weight reduction, container that can store giant-sized items. <br>
<br>
Speak with Rallik in the city of Katta Castellum; he's located in the building resembling a church, with a hedge around it, right next to the Tenebrous zone (loc -101, -39). Enter the building, take the left hall to the end, turn left, he'll be the door on the left. He was indifferent to be as a Tribunal-worshipping shaman, but KOS to a Cazic Thule monk. Hail him, follow the dialog, he asks you to bring back information from a courier. <br>
<br>
The mob you want is called 'a grimling runner'. It can be found in the Tenebrous Mtns; it spawns on the south side of the zone, right along the wall. If you're coming from the Grimling Forest, turn left after you zone and hug the wall. For me, it spawned on the hill just before the first grimling mine, and pathed toward the mine. It drops a bag, the bag is LORE and NODROP, and not really a bag (it will fit in your bags, just make sure you have a medium sized slot available). Give the bag to Rallik, he will give you the (lore) rallic pack pattern. <br>
<br>
Next you will need a perfect owlbear pelt. Many owlbears can be found in Hollowshade at the owlbear caves, loc is approx 2000 x 1000. <br>
<br>
Finally you'll need to head to the newbie area of Shadeweaver's Thicket, just outside of Shar Vahl (conveniently Shar Vahl connects Hollowshade and Shadeweaver's). You want shadeling silks, which you can get from silkworms, or the shades that roam further north (they look like skeletons). You'll need 8 silks total to make 1 shade silk cord and 1 shade silk thread (2 silks = thread, 3 threads = cord). Combine cord, thread, pelt and pattern into a sewing kit (did mine in the coldain kit) and viola, new bag. Bag is LORE but not NODROP. Trivial appears to be &lt;17<br>

Safehouse currently has the best listing/tables for the armor types that can be quested.  A LOT of this stuff is -good-, especially for &quot;filler&quot; armor that has the &quot;wrong&quot; stats.  All of the quest armors have primary stat, secondary, and third.

are all the pieces dropable(the end results like the war BP/etc)? do you need any special faction anywhere like you do w/ the velious armor quests? <p><center><img src="http://server22.hypermart.net/esx99/p00p.jpg"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub75.ezboard.com/uevildofanic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Evil Dofanic</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> at: 4/29/02 8:14:24 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CAD5D8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub75.ezboard.com/uniblikvanduvere.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Niblik Vanduvere</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Stratman</span><br>  Posts: 531<br> <font color=#333333>(4/29/02 10:33:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=50.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Luclin Quests</span><hr size=1> No special faction that I know of -- if so, you are bound to be around indifferent.
