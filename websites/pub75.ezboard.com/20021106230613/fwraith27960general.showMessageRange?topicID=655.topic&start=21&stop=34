Say we kill Vulak in north ToV (not happening anytime soon, but it's an example).  There's 6 rogues there, and he drops the Mrylokar dagger.  So those 6 rogues bid crazy high because they want it, and the winner wins with a 32 point bid.  Now he just lost ALL his points and went back to zero.  Next time we kill Vulak maybe there's 2 rogues there, and the one already has the dagger because he bid way high the time before, so the other rogue wins the same dagger with a 0.1 bid.  If I was the person that bid 32 points I would kinda feel cheated because I busted my ass helping the guild and I used every point I had to get this one item, then another person gets it for nearly free simply because there's no more of his class there that needs it.  So this is where think that system would be majorly flawed.  Some people would be paying well more than an item is worth just to make sure they get it, and others would get items for pennies.  But I do think the bid system would work great for any item that is going to rot.  I couldn;t believe some of the stuff that I saw rotting on some of Vis' raids, but people weren;t willing to spend the points on some items.  So I would rather see someone win a 6 point item with a bid of 0.5 than see it rot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/ugurunt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gurunt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#0000FF>(1/15/02 5:12:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/fwraith27960general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=655.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Point System</span><hr size=1> <br>
Yeah, problems come up in certain situatiosn in both systems.<br>
<br>
What I liked about the points system is.. it's ultimately the player that chooses to burn the points or hold back or wait.  <br>
<br>
When dealing with the class-specific stuff with only one player.. what if the rogue dagger drops for 6 points, but the rogue is only 4 points ahead of the next closest player, and the rogue wants to stay ahead to bid on some other item on a mob we'll kill next.... we let the dagger rot?  We force the rogue to get the dagger at the expense of the item he really wants? <br>
<br>
<br>
Those are lose-lose situation, niether system can handle it fairly without letting the item rot.... but IMO if we have someone making  a habit of being the only or one of the only members of thier class regularly, that's a whole different issue <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Gurunt,<br>
<br>
actually you keep coming to this one example that you use everywhere of &quot;holding back&quot; points and how that's a big flaw. If you notice ppl do that even in officer awards. Tons of ppl when asked if they want a certain item, reply by saying no they want to hold you for &quot;that one&quot; or something. In essence it's the same thing. <br>
<br>
If someone is not willing to spend the 6 points for the dagger then either<br>
1. He doesnt care for having the dagger<br>
or<br>
2. The dagger is overvalued.<br>
<br>
Feedback on loot item prices is also something I would like, same with mob values. I believe the points system comes closest to capturing a perfect system (Perfect being officer award with everything accounted, like even what time everyone arrives or who they port to bring to raids etc, executed fairly). I still see items rotting on raids (remember in VP) becasue noone cared enough to even loot the item, they didnt even want it for their twinks. <br>
<br>
Let me pose a scenario and you tell me what the solution is.<br>
<br>
There is only 1 int caster on a ToV raid who doesnt have ToV Robe. Lets say it's Sandy. Silk robe drops. She wants to hold out for the Velk Robe. What should happen. What you are proposing is that she should get to loot the silk robe somehow and still get the Velk Robe later if it drops, even if there is a wizard at the velk raid who also needs a tov robe or better and who deserves it just a little bit less than Sandy. Now if Sandy looted the ToV robe you think the other wizard wont feel cheated ? What system would work best in this scenario. What would you do in the perfect system (a perfect officer award) ?<br>
<br>
I still think a bidding system would fail since it would certainly make the second wizard feel cheated. But a point system would only endanger a loot item rotting, not anyone feeling cheated. Does this make sense ?<br>

Otherwise, the whole premise of the system goes down the tubes.<br>
The rogue weapon example above is a perfect example of this.  To illustrate the point just a bit further, let's say all 6 rogues are present both times the weapon drops, but rogue A bought the weapon the first time.  The other five rogues then just sit on their points until the raid leader declares the item open for bidding because it is going to rot... at that point the other 5 rogues can purchase the item for much less than the initial one did...<br>
<br>
I think Desi has put tons of work into the system and am willing to put my trust in him to make it the best system it can possibly be.<br>

My point was, that situation is one that is a lose/lose because in either system something rots or is given out at a steal.... <br>

You summed it up really good... you gotta accept either the item rotting or someone getting something for nearly nothing... in any case it's not for an item anyone actively wants who is there...  and in the case of any droppable or multiquestalbe peices, irrelevant anyhow <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I only see this system being fair for no drop and non-mq-able items though. That means that if people did not want an MQ-able or droppable item enough, then it could go to someone else in the future who wanted to spend those points. Now, if the item is no drop and non-mq'able, then opening it up for bids would simply set the price of the item within a specific boundary--i.e. from 0.1 to the original price of the item. <br>
<br>
People might argue that this is unfair in situations in which a class specific item drops and only one of those classes is around to bid on it. I would say that that person is simply lucky enough to be on a raid under such circumstances. Admittedly, this system would be slightly disadvantageous to classes that are required to be at raids en masse--llike clerics, warriors, etc. What you could do to help prevent people from taking advantage of this system would be to have a shadow point count as well--that is, have two point counters--one counter that tells how much they actually spent on items and another that is half of the item's estimated worth (or the amount they bid on the item--whichever is greater). Now, if a person has a lot of points but a huge shadow point count, then if an item drops that he/she can use as well as one of the more popular classes can use, then that person can bid on the item, but his/her total points for tiebreaks could come from the shadow count. <br>
<br>
I think that this system would minimize rottage. And it also addresses the concern of having a bid system that would force one rogue to pay the full price but would allow the other one to get it for nearly nothing. The second rogue gets it for nearly nothing, but he/she also ls at a disadvantage in tie-breaks later on.<br>

<br>
there's a problem with that. For instance. A couple of very good points were raised in our private msg boards.<br>
<br>
1. e.g 2 wizards see a excellent wiz item drop. They cohort and decide that one will take it now and the other later. Nooone bids for it. We revert to a bid system. They both get away with buying the item (the second one on a later date) for nearly zero and the system fails<br>
<br>
2. Both wizard want the item, the one with highest points wins, second time around the second wizard doesnt declare he wants it, we fall back to a bid system, he's the only one there , he gets it for nearly free. The system fails.<br>
<br>
i can make numerous such examples. <br>
<br>
That's why we're still sticking with the current system.<br>

How about you have two rounds: one round would be for mains, and the second round would be for twinks/friends. If no ones main wants to invest the points in an item that is nonmqable and no drop, then open up the item as a percentage off or biddable up to the amount of the item to everyones twink or for their friend's gf's account <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . For example, my GF plays a 45th level monk. Let's say no monk wants a good monk item, but there are some people in the guild who have monk twinks that would love the item. Open up the item to them for either points or for bids. This way, mains cannot conspire to trick the point system, but an item also doesn't have to rot.<br>
