<br>
You know I am always willing to help TRK as I have many good friends in there including my oldest EQ friends Amoge and Tanise.  I was at Rezann's initial Ragefire attempt ever so long ago in Sol B, and I am more than willing to help again.  I am sorry I was not online when this misunderstanding happened, but in the future I think communication between guilds involved is better solved outside the Lanys forums.  I think the root of this issue is Verant, and not fixing the cleric epic and making things like this happen.  <br>
<br>
I read through the post on Lanys, and aside from a few posts, I consider most of it petty, and frankly think it would be best having everyone go blank out their replies except for one post from you and one from my guild.  The rest of the responses do not deserve to be there.  <br>
<br>
There is only one issue here Kiting or not Kiting.<br>
<br>
From your post:<br>
*Here is where I realized Rydius had aggrod it, and was worried that he had been kiting it. However, looking back on the log, you can see that there's about 2 minutes total between the time it was first aggrod and the time it was pulled off of Rydius*<br>
<br>
Neither group talked with each other which is unfourtunate...  From all I read it appears there was no shout saying that he was being pulled as Rydius agroed before raid was ready.  Pulling rage by an experienced level 60 bard is pretty easy, and getting Rage to OT is even easier.  Turning back and running Rage around to get raid ready is mildly stated WRONG.  Pulling a mob off someone that is pulling is WRONG.  So how do we know who is right and who is wrong here?<br>
<br>
We don't.  Rydius says he was pulling after the fact, but really if he was then why was everyone not at OT waiting the inc human form except for those that had just zoned in and were on their way?  If you pull Ragefire you kill him right then and do not deviate AT ALL.  We all saw what happened when a raid that did not have the forces pulled Ragefire failed and he despawned a little while ago.  Two groups had forces there, and if it had taken any longer more probably would have showed up.<br>
<br>
So all we have to go on is:<br>
<br>
* Rydius saying he was pulling<br>
* People from my guild saying he was running in circles<br>
<br>
What can we do:<br>
<br>
* Let the current flame wars continue started on the Lanys boards which really was a bad idea.  It is really not fair to go after a whole guild in a public forum.  I was not even there and now when I go LFG are people going to see my guild tag and say &quot;oh he is Invictus, he must be a bad person.&quot;  Before you go posting on Lanys think of the consequences.  Does it make the situation better or worse?????<br>
* Move on.  Chalk it up to bad communication on both parties.  Go to Lanys and remove all but what you think your stance should be and encourage your friends to remove their flames.  I would like to see Rezann get her epic, and it would be better to foster cooperation rather than hatred.  <br>
<br>
I felt I needed to post this.  I have alot of respect for you Adjani, and I like TRK and MW, but keep these kind of incidents between guilds and out of the general populace.  As you have seen there are alot of idiots out there that post without knowing wtf they are talking about.  <br>
<br>
As I said at the beginning, I am always ready to help out TRK on anything.  The same goes for MW.  Let's put this incident behind us and work on getting Rezann her epic.  <br>
<br>
If you want to discuss any of this, feel free to send me a tell <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

While it might be hard to get everyone to agree to leave there mains for an entire weekend, imagine the look on the faces of potential competition when all of a sudden 5 full groups of fully buffed players instantly appear in the zone and drop rage immediately!<br>
<br>
You could take the idea a step further and have everyone camped out in clusters representing their group.  Each person is fully buffed and invised.  A seperate chat channel for each group and each twink logged onto it plus the main raid channel.  If Rage can't see invis you could all camp right at his spawn point too.<br>
<br>
Would be quite a sight!<br>

<br>
However, I have stated pretty much everything I have to say on the Lanys forums, and my reasons for posting there.  I did try to communicate with your leadership, and it got me nowhere.  The problem was not resolved, I do feel we have a very strong case, and I was not going to let it drop.  I do not make decisions or judgements without careful consideration first -- and indeed, I have sided against TRK and with others before, and have taken heat for it.  But in this case, I feel like Invictus was very much in the wrong, my efforts to &quot;resolve&quot; it in game were totally unproductive, and I felt like the community needed to know.  As I posted there, I have a strong sense of justice, and there was but one way for me to attempt to &quot;serve&quot; it in this case.<br>
<br>
I encourage you, if you believe what you say, to post it on Lanys on that thread.  I honestly have seen no flaming there, aside from perhaps one or two trolls, and a great deal of discussion.  The discussion would be more productive if there were more reasonable people posting from your side of the conflict as well.  And if you think that Invictus was in the right, or at least was not in the wrong, and can prove why there, then perhaps the community will agree with you as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CAD5D8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ubalearic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balearic</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>peep</span><br>  Posts: 89<br> <font color=#333333>(5/23/02 5:45:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=255.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rage for Rezann</span><hr size=1> As I told Rezann last night, Bloodsong has a Kael Arena raid scheduled for Sat. afternoon.

<br>
I believe that was the point. As the situation stands, TRK in general think that the incident was wrong. Others may agree or disagree as they wish. Adjani petitioned on behalf of TRK/MW/Rezann, and got fobbed off ("We have no way of checking", which is just an outright lie, as we all know from the CQ incident, logs are detailed and specific).<br>
<br>
Since the GMs will do nothing to assist in resolution, and Invictus did nothing to assist in resolution at the time, there are only 2 options left open to TRK as a guild.<br>
<br>
One option is to "race" in a more aggressive manner. TRK is opposed to this, and won't change this view over any incident like this.<br>
<br>
The other option is to try and seek "justice" in the matter from the general community. The idea being to force the decent and upstanding members of invictus to DO something about the way their leaders and / or officers conduct things. <br>

I think the point overall is, that if folks ARE seeing you LFG, and saying ... "no, sorry, you are in THAT guild." .. then maybe you should consider that the actions of your guild DO reflect on the people in it, and that you should make sure your GUILD is as responsible to YOU as YOU are to IT (being a fine upstanding person, that is a credit to your guild).<br>
<br>
Once again ... if the general community has heard of the discussion, and has enough of an opinion to say "sorry, we don't like the way your guild behaves", and this is impacting YOUR game, well, that's what your guild did to Rezann, and TRK/MW. If the community feels strongly enough about it, then you might want to consider that any opinion Invictus has might appear to be in the minority, and therefore a good candidate for re-evaluation. <p> - Tistalion, Just another druid</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CAD5D8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ualundraadjani.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AlundraAdjani</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.theroyalknights.org/sigs/pawprint.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Saucy Kitty</span><br>  Posts: 4492<br> <font color=#333333>(5/24/02 2:44:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=255.topic&index=14>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.theroyalknights.org/sigs/catface.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: there</span><hr size=1> Very well said Tist...may I quote you on all that on the Lanys thread? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CAD5D8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub75.ezboard.com/utistali0n.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tistali0n</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Stallion</span><br>  Posts: 539<br> <font color=#333333>(5/24/02 11:29:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=255.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: there</span><hr size=1> /sigh, lanys.com. lol.<br>

I look at the thread on Lanys and 99% of it is crap.   All that should be there are the two views of each guild, and really those views should have just been between the guilds.  Too many idiots come out to post, though it is fun to read most of them for comic relief.<br>
<br>
I was not there so I looked at the logs Adjani provided and tried to cross that with what I heard from my guild.  The only real facts are that Rage was agro'd early, and IV engaged after over 2 mins after giving a warning.  Only thing I can do is go to SF and pull a mob from the statue towards OT and see how far I can get in 2 mins.<br>
<br>
Both sides have valid points, too just blindly take one side or the other shows a lack of analysis.  Adjani did not try to hide anything and even stated that Rage was agro'd unintentionally early.  IV did not run in and engage to try to get Rage right away.  It would have been great for both guilds to communicate better, but NIETHER did.  TRK/MW is at much at fault as IV.<br>
<br>
The only people that really know what happened are Rydius and those IV people that were in view of the statue.  (I am not sure if TRK had anyone at the statue besides Rydius).<br>
<br>
What happened, happened.  It cannot be undone.  Let's try to communicate better between guilds and not drag issues like this out into the general populace, most of which don't really look at what happened, but read one sentence and dream up something.<br>
<br>
Invictus is full of great people as is TRK and MW.  I friends in all of them, and causing contention really does a dis-service to all.  Cooperation is the key to success.<br>
<br>
I consider this issue closed, let's let the thread on Lanys melt away into oblivion, the only thing that really matters is that Rezann got her epic.  Congrats Rezann and start clicking!!<br>

I also feel that I tried my best to talk to your guild leadership and it got me nowhere.  Just realize that most of us in TRK do really think we were KSed, and that Invictus was (and is) remorseless about it...we would not like to see activity like that go on, and leaving it &quot;between the two guilds,&quot; would have given no incentive to Invictus or anyone else to think twice next time.  Your guild representative gave no indication to me that Invictus would do *anything* differently if they had it to do over again...and I couldn't just let it go at that.  Once again, your leadership expressed zero remorse, and never said anything about &quot;oh if I could go back I would have communicated more,&quot; etc.<br>
<br>
I know most of Invictus thinks terrible evil things about me for taking the issue to the boards, but I would do it again if it happened to us again.  All of the facts were presented there (as you yourself admitted) and are not in dispute, so the judgements made were not uninformed ones.  I think the overwhelming support Rezann has had is evidence that we are not crazy or just jealous and vindictive, and there are many in Lanys who agree that things like that should not happen.<br>
<br>
I realize it's very hard to find fault in the guild you love and are loyal to.  It's easy to overlook things and give the benefit of the doubt...a lot of benefit of the doubt, even!  But at some point you have to look objectively and ask if you are really happy with what's going on...if you are, great, but you do unfortunately have to live with the consequences of what your guild does. :/  Just remember that while you think your guild should have communicated better and found out what was going on before pulling, your leadership does not.  They found no fault in the way they handled things and would do it that way again (well, perhaps not after the backlash from the community), from everything that has been said to me.<br>
<br>
If it had been you in charge, Kinekor, it probably would have gone down differently.  But it was not you in charge, and the &quot;fault&quot; we have found is with those who are...and, to a degree, those who continue to support their actions. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=255.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm4.showNextMessage?topicID=255.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=255.topic&index=18><img src=http://www.theroyalknights.org/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm4.emailToFriend?topicID=255.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm4.threadControl?topicID=255.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=255.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=255.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub75.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="trk72095frm1">General<option value="trk72095frm4">Raids<option value="trk72095frm27">Groups<option value="trk72095frm28">Guild items for sale<option value="trk72095frm5">Membership<option value="trk72095frm9">Honor list<option value="trk72095frm7">Quests and Tradeskills<option value="trk72095frm8">Wanted items<option value="trk72095frm6">Character updates<option value="trk72095frm2">Members' area<option value="trk72095frm3">Biographies<option value="trk72095frm25">Strategies discussion<option value="trk72095frm29">Guild applications<option value="trk72095frm10">Items to be given away<option value="trk72095frm11">Items to be claimed<option value="trk72095frm12">Items archive<option value="trk72095frm26">FV chapter archives<option value="trk72095frm13">Officer forum<option value="trk72095frm14">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/btrk72095>The Royal Knights</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm4>Raids</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.theroyalknights.org">The Royal Knights</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
