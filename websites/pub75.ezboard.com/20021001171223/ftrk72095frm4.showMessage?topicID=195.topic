Not just for the raiders on that particular raid, but for the reputation of the guild -- people will remember it for a long time if they have a bad experience with TRK!  So if you are planning on leading a raid, please read the following, and all you raid leaders if you think I left something out post it below and I will add it.<br><br>1. Start small and work your way up.  If you have never led a raid before, don't start with Trakanon.  I think my first raid leading experience was splitpaw, and then dalnir, then kedge, then PoF, etc.<br><br>2. Know the zone and/or mob WELL.  If you are leading a raid, you should have been ON that particular raid (successful ones!) several times already, and been paying attention.  If it's your first time leading a particular raid (and often if it's not) you should have maps and guides with you at all times during the raid, and you should know them and consult them.  Having an experienced raid leader along or available for questions helps tremendously as well.<br><br>3. Ask for help if you need it.  If you are not a 100% confident, successful raidleader, ask for someone to help you lead.  Even if you ARE an experienced raid leader it makes things much easier to have someone splitting the responsibilities with you.  Also remember that there is more to being a raid leader than shouting orders -- that is not even the hardest part.  The &quot;behind the scenes&quot; work is just as important, so make sure it gets done and know that it is no less crucial to the success of a raid.<br><br>4. Plan in advance.  If it's going to be a large raid, make a post detailing all of your rules and policies (especially loot rules), what classes you need, how the roster will be chosen, etc.  You can look at any of my raid posts for examples of raid policies (not all raid leaders are that thorough, but I like to be very organized).  Especially important is making sure that loot rules are laid out clearly beforehand, to make sure there are no nasty situations or arguments later.<br><br>5. Put the raid on any applicable calendars.  Always put raids on our calendar (linked from the raids forum heading), and some raids can also be posted on the Lanys.com calendar (also linked from the raids forum heading).  If you're not sure which can be posted on Lanys, just ask.<br><br>6. Speaking of the Lanys.com calendar, I will go over the &quot;rules.&quot;  Raids may be posted no sooner than 2 weeks before the event and no later than 24 hours before it.  The calendar is NOT a reservation system and posting a raid in it by no means gives you exclusive rights to a zone.  It is a tool to let others know what your intentions are.  If someone else would like the same raid on the same day, they too can post and it is the responsibility of the two conflicting raid leaders to work out the time between themselves.  By the same token, if you would like to hold a raid on the same day that someone else has it calendared, post yours as well and contact the other raid leader to work something out.  Never, EVER use the calendar as an excuse to claim exclusive rights to something, be rude to someone else when you think they are &quot;running over your raid,&quot; or refuse to work with another raid leader respectfully when there is a conflict.  Guildies can click here to read a very old post I made about the calendar:<br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm2.showMessage?topicID=56.topic">pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk720...D=56.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>(ignore all the junk in the rest of the thread, it was about something silly that happened a long time ago)<br><br>7. Make a roster a few days before the event.  Who you bring on a raid has a LOT to do with its success.  Allowing anyone and everyone in, unfortunately, can often lead to a mess, so be selective (not with guildies, of course, unless you have limited spaces).  If you are not sure about someone's reputation on raids, ask guildies or other raid leaders.  However it is NOT considerate to decide to exclude someone at the last minute -- make a roster and post it in advance so that if someone signed up but did not get in, they can make other plans.<br><br>8. Be online, at the gathering site, and preparing for the raid well in advance of the start time.  Make sure everyone has a ride who needs one.  Make sure you have all the necessary classes both before the raid and as it's starting -- no matter how much you stress to show up and be on time, there will be people who are late or just don't show.  Be prepared to send some tells and get some last minute replacements to keep the raid going.<br><br>9. If you made a roster, making groups will not be as difficult.  You should be able to use the basic groups you already made with a few modifications.  If you didn't, take time to make GOOD groups and announce them when it's time to get into groups.  Your first group should have a high level cleric, the main assist, the puller, the main enchanter, and a CoH'er if necessary (it goes without saying that you should make sure these first group people are competent!).  Other groups should be balanced with enough healing to take care of the damage group members will be taking, and so as not to have any one group so overpowered that it will take all the exp (although this usually happens no matter how hard you try :/).<br><br>10. Go over important things before the raid.  These will be different for each raid, so you might want to ask an experienced raid leader what kind of things to remind peeps about before the raid.<br><br>11. Assign someone to handle loot, someone who will do it quickly and fairly.  You will probably be too busy to handle that as well.  The person on loot should collect all money items, gems, and droppable loot for distribution at the end of the raid, and roll no-drop loot as soon as it drops.  You should ALWAYS make sure your clerics are compensated for gems, enchanters if runes are needed, mages for pearls, necros for coffins, etc.<br><br>12. Make sure the raid is moving along efficiently and that everyone is doing their jobs and following directions.  If someone is hindering the raid and/or not following instructions, you may have to TL him/her out for the good of the raid.  Always try to keep up with what is going on with the raid and stay in charge at all times.  If you are getting swamped in tells or cannot handle a situation, distribute responsibility or ask for help.  Often the biggest holdup on a raid is the raid leader him or herself -- make sure you are not holding the raid up because you are trying to take on too many things at once!<br><br>13. HAVE A CR PLAN!!  Wipeouts happen, no matter how good the raid is.  Have a plan to get the raid CR'ed and back on its feet at all times.  These will vary by zone, so ask if you need help forming one.<br><br>14. Stay positive no matter what happens.  Your attitude directly rubs off on your raiders, and if you let things get to you chances are good that the raid will not be successful or have a good time.  No matter how badly things go, do not get angry or upset while leading a raid!<br><br>15. When the raid is over, be sure you are the LAST person out.  Make sure everyone has gotten a ride out before you leave -- that is your responsibility.  If someone has gone LD, however, there is only so long you can wait for him/her. :/<br><br>16. Make sure everyone gets the loot they won, especially money items to compensate people who used components.  Sometimes this means you have to track people down after a raid, but again this is your responsibility!  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ualundraadjani.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AlundraAdjani</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.theroyalknights.org/sigs/btnappheartred.gif" BORDER=0> at: 2/14/02 1:10:27 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CAD5D8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ualundraadjani.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AlundraAdjani</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.theroyalknights.org/sigs/btnappheartred.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Saucy Phantasmist</span><br>  Posts: 3145<br> <font color=#333333>(2/14/02 12:59:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=195.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.theroyalknights.org/sigs/josie.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Raid attending guidelines</span><hr size=1> Raid ATTENDING guidelines:<br><br>Most everyone in TRK is an experienced raider, but there are still some who are not, and some who are coming on our raids who are not very experienced.  If so please read and follow these guidelines:<br><br>1. Follow instructions.  This is the number one thing.  Leading a raid is hard work (see the post above!), and when you go on a raid you agree to follow and not question ALL of the raid leader's instructions.  If you do not like the policies, do not go.<br><br>2. If you sign up, be there, be on time, and stay for the entire raid.  If you cannot go, will be late, or have to leave early, let the raid leader know ASAP.  This should go without saying, but it is sad how many times it is disregarded. :/<br><br>3. Bring anything you will need for the raid, like resist gear or spell components.  DO ask for compensation if you used expensive components for the raid but DO NOT expect the raid leader to provide everything you will need.<br><br>4. These helpful commands and settings have been known to make lag more bearable on raids:<br>/serverfilter on<br>/showspelleffects off<br>/shownames off (or /shownames 1)<br>/particle off<br>Chat filter - Set spells to group (or off/self) and turn bard songs, others' hits, and DSes off.<br>Display - possibly turn sky off (instead of 1 layer/2 layer) and clip plane down.<br>/tgb (if you have group buff spells to pass out) <br>Also, it is helpful to set your datarate.txt file (in the EQ folder) to 9.0 instead of 5.0.<br>In the eqclient.ini file, under the first bracketed phrase, it has helped many with lag and zone times to put the line:<br>UseUmbra=FALSE<br>There are some who have bad connections or technical problems and cannot help going LD.  However a great many LDs are preventable, and they slow down and/or cause disaster for the raid.  Do your part to prevent them!<br><br>5. LISTEN.  If the raid leader is talking, be quiet.  Do not spam ooc, say, or especially shout.  Do not inundate the raid leader with tells.  Do not ask for buffs in public channels, but find out who is doing what buff and send that person a tell.  Chances are that if you were listening, you would know who was doing what buff, who the MA was, etc. already.<br><br>6. Get your buffs / buff your group. Don't wait to be told. If you don't know who's buffing, find out (not in public channels unless you cannot get an answer in group or tells).  When people die, they need re-buffing. It's not a surprise, so be ready to re-buff them and keep things moving forward quickly...even more so for &quot;key&quot; people like pullers, main chanta, so on.<br><br><br>7. ASSIST FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!! :P  It's a simple concept that (IMO) ought to be tested just for a character to be able to hit level 50.  When the primary and secondary assists are called, make hotkeys RIGHT THEN.  Do NOT use any method of targetting besides your assist keys (unless you are a chanter, debuffer, etc.) and do NOT attack until you hear the assist message from the MA, even if that means not attacking for an entire fight.  It is better for NO damage to be done at all than for mezzes to be broken.<br><br>8. Please do not &quot;help&quot; the enchanters unless they ask for help (or doing the running around like a headless cheeken dance, which btw is also a license to tease us mercilessly about it later).  More often than not, this can end up making the situation worse instead of better.  I have had tanks who were attacking a mob to &quot;get it off me&quot; while I was repeatedly trying to mez it, and mez was breaking.  /cry  Do not be like this.  Chanters can usually handle themselves -- you do your job and let us do ours. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->      Note -- this does not apply to healers.  Feel free to heal a chanter all you want...I have been saved by my fair share of other groups' clerics seeing me getting beat on and helping to keep me alive. :P<br><br>9. Support and buffing classes should talk amongst themselves and distribute responsibilities if the raid leader does not do so, and let the raid know.  If you have a special job, like buffing, mezzing, pulling, etc., either do your job or ask the raid leader to assign it to someone else.  If you do not feel you can do an adequate job for whatever reason, or you have to leave, speak up and don't just let your job go undone!<br><br>10.  If you are a healer, make Hotkeys to /target the MA and SA.  If they are not in your group, preferably a few chanters as well, though the MA and SA are essential. If everything goes nuts, and depending on where you are raiding, it's not unusual for the MA's cleric to die. When this happens it's usually /shouted to heal the MA or SA. Rather then trying to mess around with typing /target MA, the hotkey helps a ton.<br><br>11. If a situation goes very bad and you hear the raid leader or another designated person shout &quot;CLERICS CAMP,&quot; that's what he/she means.  Really.  It means that if you are a cleric, camp, and if you are not a cleric DO NOT CAMP.  It means do not evac, gate, or anything else either!  It is your job to make sure the mobs stay off of the clerics so that they can get out alive, or else the CR will be very long and very nasty.<br><br>12. Do not whine or complain, especially about loot.  Even if it's just in your group.  If you don't like how a raid was run, don't go on any of that person's raids again.  If you have constructive criticism for the raidleader, tell him/her after the raid unless it's absolutely dire.  While you're on the raid, keep your whines and complaints to yourself!  And in line with that is...<br><br>13. Keep a good attitude.  Nothing ever goes perfectly, and rarely do things even go as planned.  There will be wipeouts, there will be unexpected situations, there will be bad loot days, and there will be inexperienced raid leaders.  But your main purpose is to have fun with your friends and guildies, and if you keep that in mind and keep a positive outlook, even the worst situation can turn into fun!<br><br>Edit: added suggestions. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ualundraadjani.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AlundraAdjani</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.theroyalknights.org/sigs/btnappheartred.gif" BORDER=0> at: 2/21/02 1:33:58 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CAD5D8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ulashannavalrynn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lashanna Valrynn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The woman is right.</span><br>  Posts: 812<br> <font color=#333333>(2/14/02 9:15:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=195.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://students.washington.edu/zip/eq/nicepika.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Raid attending guidelines</span><hr size=1> one thing to add for healers...<br><br>Make Hotkeys to /target the MA and SA if they are not in your group, preferably a few chanters as well, though the MA and SA are essential.

Some raid leaders have this already planned so you won't even need to do this -- but there aren't many raid leaders that are going to pre-assign tasks.<br><br>Start by using tells to discuss with those of your class what they wish to be doing.<br><br>Most enchanters are going to be discussing amongst themselves -through tells- about who is doing what buffs and the lead enchanter is usually the one to tell the raid leader that -- or the individual enchanters use the appropriate channel to inform the raiders (example:  use /ooc if /shout is being used for raid messaging).<br><br>Shamans may have a preference for what they wish to perform on a raid (like enchanters above)(Shaman01 does Str, Agi; Shaman02 does Dex, Sta; Shaman03 slows, etc.).  It helps a raid progress a lot if you discuss this with the other shamans (through tells, of course) while the raid is preparing to know who is going to do what tasks.  You can then inform the raid leader with a quick tell of:  shaman01 = str, agi; shaman02=dex, sta; shaman03=slows.  Also as above, you can use the &quot;off&quot; raid message channel to inform the raiders of the tasks you are performing (/ooc shaman02= dex, sta).<br><br>Most importantly, do NOT hog the raid channel and please don't spam.  If shout is being used to give instructions and key messages, do not start shouting spam (like songs).  Also, by spamming, you're keeping others from seeing instructions they may need. <p>Niblik Vanduvere - Proud to be a member of The Royal Knights - Epic Enchanter 55<BR>We control the Veritical...

Rosters do make life a lot less complicated. <p><img src="http://members.spinn.net/~paradise/tanise.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CAD5D8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub75.ezboard.com/usoltice69r.showPublicProfile?language=EN>soltice69r</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cross-dressing gangsta</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#333333>(2/23/02 2:40:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=195.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Raid attending guidelines</span><hr size=1> aye i am one of those people to dont read alot of the board so i miss out on alot off stuff=( gonna try to make this a everyday thing so i can go to more places with you guys or at least if i am available to go to that raid. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CAD5D8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub75.ezboard.com/upuina.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Puina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guild mommy</span><br>  Posts: 284<br> <font color=#333333>(4/26/02 6:18:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=195.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Raid leading and attending guidelines</span><hr size=1> I think I should add.  If you have a bard in the group, in order to know if you are in range for manna song, you need bard songs on, or be close enough to hug him/her after the battle LOL.  You get the message &quot;your mind clears&quot;.
