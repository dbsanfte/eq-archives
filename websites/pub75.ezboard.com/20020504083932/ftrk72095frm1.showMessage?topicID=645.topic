It’s a foggy landscape, and serene at first glance. 13 people stand in the forest, apparently waiting for something. A naturalist cult? No, it’s something even stranger…<br><br>Welcome to Everquest!<br>You have entered Greater Faydark<br>GroupOfPlayers says, “Geez, Mage, what took you so long? We’re waiting to get this raid started here!”<br>Mage says, “Sorry about that. I just had to edit my letter to VI about class balance – wouldn’t you know it, they wouldn’t let me send an e-mail larger than 10 Megs.”<br>Wizard says, “You know, not every argument has to be accompanied by a picture...”<br>Mage stares blankly at Wizard.<br>Mage says, “Picture? What are you talking about? I just had a lot of arguments.”<br>Silence for a few moments. And then…<br>Warrior coughs.<br>Warrior says, “Alright, then. Shouldn’t we be getting underway?”<br>Monk says, “Right, then. Let’s get buffed up, then we’ll zone in.”<br>11 players begin to buff themselves, while the cleric, shaman, and enchanter begin to make hotkeys for /r GET IN LINE<br>Cleric shouts, “+++((AREA OF EFFECT AEGO))+++ incoming! STAY IN RANGE!”<br>Cleric begins to cast a spell.<br>10 seconds pass.<br>Everyone waits.<br>10 seconds pass.<br>Cleric says, “Ah, there we go.”<br>Druid says, “What, almost done casting?”<br>Cleric says, “No – saw the pink bar move.”<br>Rest of players gape at cleric<br>Cleric says, “How is this my fault?”<br>Rest of the raid sighs and resumes buffing.<br>Shadowknight, having nothing better to do then wait for buffs, counts everyone at the raid.<br>Shadowknight says, “12…13…14. Wait a sec, what about the Beastlord?”<br>Paladin says, “Erm..well. You see, the only 60 Beastlords on our server were powerleveled since level 1, so they don’t really have any idea how to play their class in a raid environment.”<br>Shadowknight says, “You’re going to tell me that a player can get to level 60 without learning even the basics of how to…”<br>Shadowknight is cut off as we hear:<br>A_Level_60_Beastlord_With_2_Days_Played says out of character, “Hey guys, I figured out how to use ‘/pet follow me’! Plus I got my channeling up to ‘Good’. Can I please raid with you now?”<br>13 Players /shout “NO!”<br>Shadowknight says, “I see…”<br>SadBeastlord says out of character “**sniff…”<br>Paladin says out our of character, “Don’t try your sympathy game with us! I saw you trying to talk to your pet yesterday, for God’s sake!”<br>Beastlord says out of character, “Aww, come on. I’m sure every pet class tries it sometime.”<br>Paladin says out of character, “I bet most pet classes don’t try to feed their pets too.”<br>Beastlord says out of character, “But..but…he was hungry!”<br>Paladin says out of character, “I also saw you try to feed him dark elf parts.”<br><br>Meanwhile…<br><br>Enchanter /shouts “Alright, I’m ready to haste people. Send me a BLANK TELL now if you need SoS!”<br>Paladin tells Enchanter “.”<br>Monk tells Enchanter “.”<br>Warrior tells Enchanter “.”<br>Shadowknight tells Enchanter “.”<br>Bard tells Enchanter “.”<br>Ranger tells Enchanter “.”<br>Rogue tells Enchanter “d00d haste plz thx keke”<br>Enchanter sighs. “There’s always one...” he thinks to himself.<br>Beastlord tells Enchanter “.”<br>Enchanter sighs.<br><br>Simultaneously, Wizard, Mage, and Necro are engaged in an intelligent and rational discussion of class balance…<br><br>Wizard says, “Oh YEAH? Well you’re nothing but a mod rod b!tch!”<br>Mage says, “Why you little…”<br>Necro says, “You pansy wizard! I’ll out-solo you any day!”<br>Wizard says, “Little? LITTLE? I don’t see YOU getting the exp from uber mobs!”<br>Mage, “Keep talking, and I’ll take one of those mod rods and shove it right up your…”<br>Mage is interrupted as Wizard whips out his Staff of the Four and swings it fiercely at Mage, screaming “Channel through THIS!”<br>Strangely, despite being a mere 2 feet from the Mage, who is standing completely still, Wizard misses.<br>Wizard tries to hit Mage, but misses! <br>Wizard tries to hit Mage, but misses!<br>Wizard tries to hit Mage, but misses!<br>Wizard tries to hit Mage, but misses!<br>Wizard says, “Hmm…”<br>Mage says, “Hah, I’ve max’ed out 1HB!

Wtf…we’re all 60. Any of us could solo any mob in the zone. What exactly are we raiding?<br>Shaman says, “You really don’t know?”<br>Warrior says, “No, and I can’t figure it out either. If we were raiding Kedge or something, we would have ported to Butcherblock…and if, for some odd reason, we were raiding Mistmoore, we would have ported to Steamfont. But here we are in Gfay…<br>Shaman says, “Keep going…”<br>Warrior thinks a bit<br>Warrior says, “Well, that takes care of any potential raid zones…unless…”<br>Shaman says, “Hey, I think you might have it. It only took you 10 minutes too!”<br>Warrior says, “Unless we were raiding…”<br>Shaman says, “Yep”<br>Warrior says, “NO!”<br>Shaman says, “I’m afraid so.”<br>Warrior says, “But…Crushbone?”<br>Shaman says, “Sure.”<br>Warrior says, “I’m no INT caster, but isn’t Crushbone a little…um…LOW FOR US?”<br>Shaman says, “Holy hell, don’t you read patch messages?”<br>Warrior says, “Um, no…I find them a little long-winded. Why do you ask?”<br>Shaman rolls his eyes, then hands Warrior a piece of paper.<br>Shaman says, “Here, read this”<br><br>Patch message, January 4th, 2003<br>--------------------<br>Greetings Norrathians!<br><br>Our continued campaign to revitalize old zones, started over a year ago with the pioneering Cazic-Thule 2.0, continues this week with our new, improved, Crushbone 2.0! As per pervious revamps, such as Blackburrow 3.0, (Blackburrow 2.0 needed a revamp – the ‘a patrolling gnoll’ mobs were deemed unbalancing content – lower delay between deathtouches was needed to maintain balance in this zone) we have been very thorough in balancing the content.<br><br>Also, as per previous revamps, we apologize to lower level players utilizing this zone for experience gain. However, the increasing number of higher level players requires us to create new, exciting, content.<br><br>We encourage every high level player to explore Crushbone 2.0<br>Fabulous corpse recoveries await you! Don’t miss out!<br><br>----------------------------<br>Item changes<br>----------------------------<br>The speed of Journeyman’s Boots has been decreased. They will now be known as “Quadriplegic Gnome’s Boots”<br>The taunt of Willsapper has been decreased…again.<br>The low-end rogue weapon “MildAngerBringer” has been changed to No Drop<br>The casting time on Arch Mage’s Robe has been decreased<br>The effect on Arch Mage’s Robe has been changed to Summon Dagger<br><br>----------------------------<br>Spell changes<br>----------------------------<br>Due to popular demand, lower level versions of the “Al-Kabor” line of spells are now in game. These include the level 1 “Brain Freeze of Al’Kabor”, and the level 4 “Stove-Top Burn of Al’Kabor”<br>The ‘Tash’ line of spells is now partially resistible. The mob now has a 1% chance to find and strangle that damn barking dog.<br>Following our plan to make lower levels more bearable, we’ve added a new ranger spell: Coffee Jolt, a Single Target Aggro Reducer, at level 20.<br>The Wizard Familiar line of spells now produces a zone-wide flapping noise<br>Added a new bard song: “Fat Frank’s Flirtatious Flamenco” – Small AoE stun, random duration. (Level 54)<br>The Druid DoT line of spells no longer stack with snare.<br>Added a Necromancer spell to the undead-only DD line at level 1: Tickle Undead (5 damage)<br><br><br>Shaman says, “Well, now you know.”<br>Warrior says, “Wow! What other valuable information have I been missing?”<br>Shaman hands Warrior a stack of old patch messages.<br>Warrior says, “WOW! I can taunt level 61+ mobs now!”<br>Shaman has become better at rolling his eyes at melee classes! (302)<br><br>Meanwhile, the buffing stage was winding to a close…<br><br>Monk says, “Ok, are we all ready?”<br>Ranger says, “Yep, we’re all buffed. On to Crushbone!”<br>The players begin to move out towards orc hill, staring wearily into the forest for signs of a hostile mob. Ahead, the party spots a lone centurion.<br>Monk says, “Right then, I’ll need something to pull with.”<br>Mage says, “Here, allow me.”<br>Mage memorizes Pouch of Quellious and begins to cast it.<br>Monk summons his own.<br>Monk says, “Oh, right. Forgot I had this.”<br>Mage sighs and waits for Flying Kick on his Velious armor.<br>Monk approaches the lone orc, hurls a shurikin, and starts running back.<br>Monk hits an orc centurion for 48 points of damage.<br>An orc centurion has been slain by Monk!<br>Druid says, “WHAT’D IT DROP? WHAT’D IT DROP?”<br>The rest of the raid stares at Druid.<br>Monk says, “A cracked staff.”<br>Druid says, “Well, I was just asking…”<br>Rogue says, “Well, I guess they didn’t upgrade Gfay along with Crushbone. Zone in, then?”<br>Necro says, “Lead on!”<br>The raid makes its way to the entrance, while the Shadowknight, who’s getting pretty darn good at those numbers, is counting the raid again. <br>Shaman says, “Ready to zone in?”<br>Shadowknight says, “Wait a second, guys…we had 14 to start with, right? Well, I count 13 now.”<br>The raid counts themselves, and indeed there are only 13 of them.<br>Paladin says, “Ok, well who’s missing.”<br>Warrior says, “Let’s see….me, Enchanter…well that’s everyone...Hey! Wait a second, where’s Cleric?”<br>Warrior /shouts, “Hey Cleric, we’re at the Crushbone zone, where the hell are you?”<br>Cleric /shouts, “I’m still at the Orc lift…AE Aego is almost done! I can’t see the pink bar anymore, so you’ve got about 45 seconds to get back.”<br>Everyone runs franticly back to the Orc lift.<br><br>45 seconds later…<br><br>Cleric finishes casting, and 13 players plus 14,000 newbies that gathered around Cleric get Aego. <br>Necro says, “Wait another second…13 of us got aego? NOW who’s missing?”<br>Warrior says, “Druid. I believe he’s back at that orc’s corpse ninja’ing the cracked staff.”<br>The raid collectively rolls their eyes and moves back to the entrance to Crushbone, picking up the Druid on the way.<br>Monk says, “Alright, this is it! Let’s zone in!”<br><br>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT…<br>You have entered the Crushbone Citadel of Happiness and Love<br>Emperor Crush scowls at you, ready to attack – what would you like your tombstone to say?<br>Bard says, “Um…”<br>Ranger says, “OMG! Emperor Crush is at the zone! What the heck?”<br>Wizard says, “Um, he’s red to me.”<br>Necro says. “Time to zone out, I think.”<br>Monk says, “Wait, guys, he’s not attacking us. Let’s talk to him.”<br>Monk says, “Hail, Emperor Crush.”<br>Emperor Crush says, “Greetings, brave travelers. Welcome to the Crushbone Citadel of Happiness and Love. Might you be interested in some [phat lewt]?”<br>Monk says, “Alright, quiet guys. Remember what happens to you when you say ‘Phat Lewt’ to the prince in…”<br>Everyone stares, horrified, at Monk<br>Wizard screams at Monk, “YOU IDIOT! YOU JUST SAID IT!”<br>Druid whistles a little tune. “Not my fault this time…” he says.<br>Monk says, “Urp.”<br>Emperor Crush grins evilly.<br><br>The end<br> <p><center><img src = http://nilsig.homestead.com/files/Silvseig.gif></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ucazziniamairellup.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cazzinia Mairellup</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Flirt</span><br>  Posts: 79<br> <font color=#333333>(4/9/02 6:45:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=645.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://w1.158.telia.com/~u15804439/pp.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Crushbone 2.0</span><hr size=1> *Laughs* <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><html><center><a href="http://www.theroyalknights.org/"><IMG SRC="http://w1.158.telia.com/~u15804439/cazzinia2a.jpg" border=0></a><BR>Cazzinia - <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=36417" target=_blank>Profile</a> - 55 Human Mastergirly<BR>Cazzy - <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=74476" target=_blank>Profile</a>  - 51 High Elf Vicar<br><a href="Mailto:Cazzina@spray.se">E-Mail</a> | <a href="aim:goim?screenname=ESCazzina&message=Hey+Cazz,+You+there?">AIM</a></html></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ucorrvin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Corrvin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dr00d herder</span><br>  Posts: 939<br> <font color=#333333>(4/9/02 11:17:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=645.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Crushbone 2.0</span><hr size=1> OMFG!!<br><br>i just completely scared the shit of the 2000000 people in the computer lab, this is THE! funniest eq story ever. <p><BR><center><img src="http://communities.msn.com/_Secure/0NQD**04TkwUzDgWFHSpubdJ3Nepn1zyuQxP7jBkaCoBlgAMONHtDLzwueHZkd6wLvC3TD7h1Vwwf3BckWNe6LA/corrsig.jpg"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ubruujo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bruujo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Nook happy!</span><br>  Posts: 158<br> <font color=#333333>(4/9/02 1:39:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=645.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.cox.net/aurthur/bruujopersonalpic-tim.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Crushbone 2.0</span><hr size=1> ROFL, too good. <p><center><img src="http://members.cox.net/aurthur/brusig2.jpg"><br><br>Wizard of far too many AE's to count.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub75.ezboard.com/btrk72095.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=luix>Luix</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistell King</span><br>  Posts: 276<br> <font color=#333333>(4/9/02 4:53:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=645.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Crushbone 2.0</span><hr size=1> Woot!
