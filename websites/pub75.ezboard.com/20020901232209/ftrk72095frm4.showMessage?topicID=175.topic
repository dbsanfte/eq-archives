<br>
Lvls 53+ only 4 groups total<br>
I want to go to the 7th isle if possible.  But I cannot say that we will make it that far or not.  Mage epic defaulted to Silverrain.  Warrior epic piece defaulted to Tanise.  Necro epic defaulted to Brooder if he can go, if not then it will go to me.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->              Please post here with your name, class, and level only if you can go to this.  And please post any information if you need anything for a quest/epic from PoA. Not sure what exactly Adjani wants me to do, she asked me to let her lead this raid because she thinks this might be too hard for me to lead.  But she doesn't know when she will be able to lead one since she hasn't been feeling well lately.  This means that the epic rules and scheduled date and time will be subject to change, so those who I promised a default to their epic piece I'm sorry if this got your hopes up.<br>
<br>
ADJANI'S EDIT:<br>
<br>
I'll be helping Lakmir lead this.  I have some additional &quot;rules and policies&quot; to add to his that are somewhat stricter -- sorry peeps but PoA is a TOUGH raid and we need to get as far as fast as we can.  To do this we need 24 of the highest most experienced peeps we can get.<br>
<br>
53+ for TRKers and 55+ for others, and like I said ONLY 24 CAN GO -- that means very few compared to our normal raids, and I might have to say no to some peeps if there is not room, even guildies. :/  Don't blame me, blame verant for bad zone design!  Besides the 24 I take, I *might* port up reinforcements at some point like for farming the Spiroc Lord.  If you are put on the &quot;possible reinforcements&quot; list please try to be available later in the day in case we do port you up.  You will be entitled to roll on all droppable loot when the raid is over if you are ported up late (as well as anything no-drop that drops while you are there).  <br>
<br>
The first spiroc blade, the first mage crown, the first necro epic item will be defaulted to a TRKer, I'll discuss with Lakmir who.  Although the first of those epic pieces will be defaulted, NO PoA quest items are defaulted and no other epic pieces are defaulted, so there will still be plenty of opportunity to win something!  As usual on my raids, whining or complaining about loot is your first-class ticket out, I don't care how crucial you are to the raid.<br>
<br>
Please bring 100pp and 3 tiny coffins -- just in case.  100pp will help offset the large cost of port up stones and gems for clerics.  Tiny coffins will be used when (notice I say when, not if heh) someone does not loot a key in time and has to be summoned across to the next island, for reinforcements to be brought up, etc.<br>
<br>
If we are to get all the way we are going to have to be tight and listen very closely at all times.  This will not be a 2-hours-between-every-island PoA raid -- we will be moving and fighting almost constantly, and even while fighting I will be giving important instructions.  There will be only 24 people so lag should not be a problem, and I need everyone to listen CAREFULLY so that everything will work.  On most islands, if we keel the wrong mob at the wrong time, if a key class doesn't camp out or feign, or someone crucial doesn't loot his/her key it can end the entire raid.  Even though it will be fast-paced, it will be a VERY LONG raid, so please do not come if you cannot commit for the entire day -- I'm talking 10-12 hours minimum.<br>
<br>
If you have not been to PoA before, please at least skim this guide to become familiar with it, so I don't have to explain *quite* so much:<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://members.cohesive.net/~rtaylor/EQ/skyguide/">members.cohesive.net/~rta.../skyguide/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
What I need at a minimum:<br>
4 clerics, at least one rez stick<br>
1 other enchanter besides me, also 60 if at all possible (dictate = powa)<br>
1 60 shaman (or 1 60 mage + 1 55+ shaman for slows and debuffing /poke Qalas)<br>
1 60 warrior to tank the 60+ mobs (can you get to 60 in 2 weeks Tanise?)<br>
1 puller (I emailed soleran so hopefully he will come back for this :P)<br>
1 necro with EEs to get to a safe spot and feign at the first sign of trouble (this will probably be Lakmir's job)<br>
1 necro with SC2 (/poke broods)<br>
2 wizards for port ups and for retrieving reinforcements<br>
<br>
Note that this isn't ALL I need, just the minimum in some classes.  We still need to fill in the rest of the groups with backup healers, backup crowd control, and most importantly damage dealers.  Pets will be allowed on most but not all islands, so please ask me if I forget to tell you whether they are allowed on a given island or not.<br>
<br>
&quot;Extras&quot; I need (will be camped out most of the raid -- preferably someone's &quot;second account&quot; /poke Vailwind):<br>
1 cleric to camp on isle 1 to rez reinforcements before they get summoned<br>
1 cleric to camp on the island we are currently on in case of wipeout<br>
1 mule to camp at the Tox spires with our extra port stones<br>
<br>
Please sign up below if you are interested, including your char name, class, level, and any PoA experience you have (don't assume I know all this no matter how well I know you, I am batty :P), and check back here in the days before the raid to see the roster.  BE ON TIME FOR QUELLIOUS' SAKE!!!!  I will have all groups made ahead of time and we will start PORTS promptly at 10am, we will NOT start gathering at 10.  If you are not there, you most likely will be replaced, so set your alarm!<br>
<br>
We MIGHT have extra epic items for MQing after the raid is over but DO NOT ASK ME DURING THE RAID!  Lakmir and I will handle loot in a separate thread after the raid, and we will probably sell MQing rights on any extra items we have -- normally TRK does not sell anything but we plan on doing some expensive raids soon, so we will need the funds. :/<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
ROSTER:<br>
<br>
Note about roster:  Please PLEASE do not be offended if you did not make it on the roster.  We are very strictly limited to 24 spots and we had far more than 24 sign up, so some difficult decisions had to be made!  I made the decisions based on what I thought would get us the furthest (gotta get those mage crowns) and gave priority to guildies.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately our crew is not terribly high in level or PoA experience. :/  I am afraid we will probably not make it all the way, but Lakmir has graciously offered to loot keys and  stay in PoA so that we can go straight to a higher isle next time.  However we will still be trying to get as far as we can, but we'll be stopping to farm several spiroc blades on spiroc isle, and we'll be porting up additional peeps for that.  So if you didn't make it into the &quot;original 24,&quot; not only might you be called up if we have no shows, but you will be ported up to help with the spiroc lord.<br>
<br>
We also do have several &quot;pet clerics&quot; to camp out in strategic locations. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->       <br>

ADJANI'S EDIT AGAIN:  Wonderful news!  Thanks to my new friend Kimja (and Spiritseeker for recommending him!) we are *probably* going to skip straight to pegasus isle and start from there!  This means that, if Kimja is able to help us, EVERYONE who signed up can come, provided I can find a healer for each group.  So please EVERYONE be in Tox at 10am PST tomorrow and hopefully we will be able to get everyone in.  Also please DO NOT forget to bring tiny coffins!!!  Bring at least 100pp and 3 tiny coffins, more if possible would help!  We will need a bunch.<br>
<br>
Lakmir's edit: Adjani, just so you know, part of the necro epic comes from two isles before pegasus isle.  The necro epic item from PoA is the Cloak of Spiroc Feathers.  This needs a Silver Disck from isle 2, a Spiroc Feather from isle 3, and they of course the black silk cape from isle 4 (pegasus isle)<br>
<br>
Adjani's edit: Lakmir -- if we get this opportunity, we can port a couple of groups up and do isles 1-3 any evening. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     They are not difficult, it is the ones beyond them that are tough. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ualundraadjani.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AlundraAdjani</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.theroyalknights.org/sigs/btnappheartred.gif" BORDER=0> at: 2/15/02 9:50:46 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CAD5D8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ubalearic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balearic</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>peep</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#333333>(1/21/02 3:25:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=175.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: PoA TRK and friends only!

Sat. February 16th 10am PST</span><hr size=1> I would enjoy attending this raid.<br>
<br>
57 SHD, done PoA about half a dozen times so far, but furthest I've ever been to is Spiroc island, hehe.  Always for war epic, hehehe.  <br>
<br>
Technically, I need the Blade of Abrogation (SK epic piece) but I would default to any SK who has already made *any* progress on the epic, since I currently have no pieces for it yet <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I am also in need of a Diaphanous Globe (3rd island, several mobs there can drop it) to complete my PoA haste belt quest (I have the finely woven cloth belt and dried leather already).  Again, I would feel guilty taking this if a TRK member needed (also used in Pally haste belt, and some druid quest, I think) so I would default to them.  <br>
<br>
I am trying to hit other PoA raids in the meantime, but . . . even if I get the pieces before this raid, I would enjoy just hanging with you guys, I always have a good time in PoA.  <br>

However, if you can use me, I do have a 2nd acct with a cleric pet who I would be happy to park anywhere you want him, although he's only 51 (49 res *cry*) . . . might be better &quot;wipeout protection&quot; than &quot;rezzer for late port ups&quot; . . .  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub75.ezboard.com/udohrt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dohrt</A> at: 2/4/02 6:02:48 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CAD5D8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ulinox.showPublicProfile?language=EN>linox</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pinky</span><br>  Posts: 190<br> <font color=#333333>(1/31/02 4:33:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub75.ezboard.com/ftrk72095frm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=175.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: PoA TRK and friends only!
