I &quot;grew up&quot; on eq playing a chanter...woot! hps. A good RL friend had a high level mage, and never being 1 to be really smart about things, I died ALOT to mod rods...hell, I've manastoned myself to death on more chars more times than I care to admit...@#%$ happens.<br>
<br>
As to the flame war thats brewing here, this is how I look at it. This board is Wraiths home. Would you in RL go into someones home and start talking @#%$ about 1 of their family? Prolly not. Thin made an appology. End of topic.<br>
<br>
If your that put out about the 3 blue bubs of xp (I'm guessing yer around 30), that should take a hour to get again...contact me in game. I'll be on either Timok, Nadili, Mhartyni or Kalua. I'll come over and spend the 20 minutes it'll take to PL back the lost xp.<br>
<br>
Now as I'm not a member of Wraith anymore (well erm kinda, Mhartyni's tagged, but thats my wifes account) you can't hold the Wraith/Reviv officers accountable for what I'm about to say...ENOUGH!!! get over it. I personally hope to not see ya post on this topic here again. An offer has been extended by me, either take me up on it, or let the @#%$ matter drop.<br>

<br>
This happenend a year ago. I was sitting by the DN entrance when this VILE VILE SK ran over with a phase spider, and fd'ed and got me killed. <br>
<br>
I was thinking &quot;wth !!&quot; when he sent me a tell apologizing and told me he'd get me a rez and asked for consent. I gave him consent and voila !!! I got a rez. <br>
<br>
I popped up into Jaled Dar's room naked with my corpse no where in sight. Here I am staring at this HUGE translucent dragon that I had never seen before in a room with 1 door which is locked  and I am trapped. I sent a tell to this VILE VILE SK asking wth was going on. I was frustrated by my own helplessness and amused at my stupidity. He replied it was a joke and warned me not to go near the door. I ofcourse did go near the door, 2 spiders from the other side attacked me and I died again. <br>
<br>
Later we both had a good laugh about this and I still remember the incident clearly amongst all the times I've been online in EQ and laugh about it. These are the moments that stick with you. It's a game. You cant get too serious.<br>
<br>
So just let this go and one day you too will laugh about this.<br>
<br>
And never consent Ggan to drag your corpse.<br>

Anyway, shrug, like most lessons I learned when I first started playing, you learn them the hard way. Being good at this game is not only about knowing your class,  but knowing the other classes as well. I bet your wife knows a whole lot more about how mage summoned items work now, and will think twice about any she sees in the future.<br>

And to be honest, it is one of the oldest tricks in the book. Dand, Tun, and I used to get lit then give them to orcs in EC and sit back and have some laughs.<br>

When i post this all i wanted was an Apology from Thin to my Wife.  When my wife send him a tell all he said was it wasn't his fault (yes, granted she was the one that click on it but if Thin hadn't come by then it wouldn't happened).  I didn't come here and start trouble with Wraith or Reviv (no one in the right sense of mind would do that) but when i got reply doubting me and sayiny my life is dull that pissed me off.  I post this because my wife was so upset and lost her lvl so i figure i had to do something being the husband and all (anyone would do it if they were in my situation).  I don't want my wife getting Powerlvl or anything (but thanks for the offer) like that.  Three blue bubs of exp is easy to get back at 34.  We got it back that night.<br>
<br>
Now if Thin would have talked to me (Rrarna) at the time then i wouldn't post this here.  Im not mad anymore, Im letting this go.  I  would like to Apologize to all Wraith and Reviv Members for the negative post that i've made.  /Sorry.  Now Thin (or your friend) if you could or would post an Apology (no smart remark) to my wife i would really appreciate it and we all can go back and enjoy the game.  Thanks in advance.<br>

Once again my Apologize to all Wraith and Reviv )<br>
