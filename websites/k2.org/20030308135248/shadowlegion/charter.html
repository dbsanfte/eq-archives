1. The Shadow Legion <TSL> is a mercenary guild based on an inner council of five as the governing force behind the guild.  This number is possible of change if deemed necessary, or if we feel another may be more appropriate for the position. These members being chosen by merit to decide upon issues the guild may have.  Although this council meets in secrecy to decide issues, members are encouraged, and required to let the council know of any thing that could be deemed as useful information to the guild.  This information could include:<BR> 
             1.  An enemy gathering or eyeing a fortress of ours<BR>
2.  A known spy thieving information.<BR>
3.  A potential threat to any members safety.<BR>
The list continues on and may be amended at any time by the council.  Each member knows their self what type on information could be valuable and necessary for the guild. <BR>

2. All working contracts accepted by the Council will become the responsibility of all members to complete. <TSL> does not recognize any relationships outside of itself when it comes to the completion of a contract. As a mercenary guild, <TSL> and its’ members will take no part in guild versus guild conflicts without just compensation.  This could be a nice sum of money, or allegiance to our parent guild.<BR>

3.  Each member is known for his or her credentials on the battlefield, as well as their responsibilities and duties at home.  Each member is in charge of protecting the fort, or any other member from harm.  It is possible to both gain in rank, and to decrease if the Council sees fit. <BR>  

4.  New members will be submitted to a probationary trial period in which they will be watched by fellow members, and the  council.  New members may only be invited to the guild by the Council, or by sworn members.  New members will be asked to submit any questions/problems they may be having to the council. <BR> 

5.  Members of TSL will always help each other before helping outsiders. Members will group with other members before grouping with outsiders.  It is the RESPONSIBILITY of senior members to help junior members at every possible opportunity.  Members are encouraged to recruit outsiders.  Members are responsible for life for those Initiates they bring before the guild for membership. The actions of the Initiate will reflect back to the member for good or bad.<BR>

6.  The Shadow Legion will not tolerate arguing in guild chat or any public channels. If those who are in an argument first result to a private discussion between each other and find no solution, the dispute will go to the Council of Five for arbitration.  The council will resolve the issue and the decision will be binding. <BR>
