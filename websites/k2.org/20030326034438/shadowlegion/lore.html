<p><font size=3>It began after the Turning.</p><p>
When Aerynthian was in upheaval and nations were at war against one another.  
When there was only chaos, destruction and pain in the world.  One man,
Gailaron the Unmerciful, saw opportunity.</p><p>
It was Gailaron, our founder and mentor, who brought together the unwanted 
children of the world.  It was he who gave us purpose and showed us
the true meaning of Brotherhood.  And so The Shadow Legion was born.</p>  
<p>In those early days, contracts were few and far between, but never was a 
contract taken and not completed.  Gailaron taught us to first swear allegiance
to each other.  After that, allegiance must be sworn to the contract.
In this way, he taught us that even though we were small in number, no 
employer would doubt our integrity.  Had the world stayed the same we may
still be that same small band.  Things always seem to change though and so
it came about that Gailaron did accept a contract from a guild called
Ebonlore.  The job was of no real consequence, only an assassination of
a lowly noble from a warring guild, but Ebonlore was so impressed by the 
efficiency with which we accomplished our task that they took note of us.</p></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:40px;left:520px;width:390px;height:25px"><p>Ebonlore offered us shelter and protection.  At first there was much grumbling
from within our ranks, but Gailaron had the foresight and wisdom to see
what needed to be done.  So it came to pass that we came under the protective 
care of Ebonlore.  In time, all have agreed that this was indeed a wise decision.</p>
<p>Gailaron the Unmerciful stood back and saw what he had created and it was good.
Not for himself did he do these things.  Nor for personal glory.  He taught 
us that personal sacrifice is the only path that will make The Shadow Legion
strong.</p>
<p>As happens in our world, Gailaron went out with a small hunting party and was 
never seen again.  Although we searched for months we could not find any trace
of him or the hunting party.</p>
<p>In his absence we formed a Council of Five to govern us all until the day
Gailaron returns.  So it is now as it has always been.  Our brotherhood within
The Shadow Legion remains strong.  Contracts are taken and completed and 
we grow stronger and richer with each passing month.</p>  
<p>So shall it always be.</p></DIV>
