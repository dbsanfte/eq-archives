<div class=medium><img src="images/W.gif" align="left">elcome displaced soul, to our abode in the depths of this world. Do not expect a friendly welcome unless you are of our likes. We, the Society of the Dark, are a close brotherhood. We may welcome you wanderer, if you follow the path into our shadows. Our loyalty to the Society is unstoppable, as is our wrath to those who cross us. The shadows are everywhere, as we are, and our alliances made will be carved in stone. Join our family and be one of us, or run now and hide from our brethren always.</div>

After an insane effort on the part of Kalador the forums are all nice and cozy at k2.org - again with much thanks to Ewle and the Ebonlore Nation for their help and hosting!<br />
The legion's Roster has been updated to reflect those who can't or wont try to join us when SB goes gold - things are moving even faster now.<br />
Three and a bit weeks folks.

Unfortunately portland was hosting our forum and is now down or not supporting MySQL. So we are currently working to fix it and move the forum to a new host, possibly k2.org. Everyone blame Kalador for it not working.<br />

We have added new members Rimmshot and Braxx. <br />
Rimmshot is a new one to us so lets welcome him. Braxx is one of our old members from UO who has finally showed back up. Glad to have you both.<br />
<br />
Also We have changed ranks to reflect the rank system in SB
