NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES<br> ========================<br>- Falling damage has been enabled. Damaged is assessed based on the distance fallen, and is expressed as a percentage of a player's total hit points. In general, you'll only experience this when you jump off of a wall, building, tower, dungeon pit, steep hill or mountain, etc. If you're at full hits, you will never take enough damage to kill you from one fall (99% maximum). However, if you've been hit by a monster or player, a subsequent fall may kill you. When descending steep terrain, some extra care will be needed, especially when under the effect of speed-enhancing magic. Remember to use the Walk key (defaults to F) to help you safely navigate steep mountains and hills.<br><br> - Thief classes get a new ability called Safe Fall as part of their Stealth specialization track. They receive one level of Safe Fall per 10 levels of Stealth. Each level of safe fall lessens the damage from a fall and increases the minimum "no damage" height they can fall from. The highest levels of Safe Fall allow the thief to jump from a keep wall and take very little damage.<br><br> - There was a problem with the Critical Shot skill for Archer characters from Midgard and Hibernia only who were Realm Rank 2. Under those circumstances, their critical shots did only normal damage. This has been fixed.<br><br>- Fixed a bug where a siege equipment could sometimes cause damage to members of the realm that built it.<br><br>- You can now jump normally in cities (some city spots would keep you from jumping).<br><br> - Players with low frame rates will no longer fall through the city after they jump.<br><br> - Players would sometimes not be able to see other players in the city - this has been fixed. <br><br>- We've fixed the bug where high level players (35+) would sometimes not be granted higher level combat styles and spell abilities. Older characters are converted as they enter the game to gain these abilities and newer characters should get them normally.<br><br> - We fixed an issue where relics would respawn in a state where they were not carryable. <br><br>- The percent chance to hit with your second weapon when dual wielding has been increased (thus increasing the aggregate DPS for dual wielders). Likewise, the damages for left axe have been increased.<br><br> - There was a bug where you could manipulate the salvage system to duplicate items. This was relatively unknown - but it has bene fixed.<br><br>RvR Frontier Keeps:<br><br>We have made some changes to the frontier keeps throughout all three realms, particularly with the roaming patrols that move about the zones controlled by the keeps. Up until this point the areas of land controlled by the keeps has been quite small, with large gaps between the controlled lands, allowing armies to bypass the keeps to get deep into an enemy realm. In order to encourage invaders to take the frontier keeps, and defenders to defend them we have increased the area that the outlying patrols from each keep move about in. In general these areas now overlap, so that it's possible that patrols from more than one keep guard a single section of land. The number of these patrols has also been increased to account for the larger area that needs to be patrolled. Over the course of this week we'll be making more changes to the frontier keep and relic keep guard forces and adding incentives to the keeps to give more benefits to owning them. All of these changes will be made with the intent to give the frontier keeps more meaning, and encourage invaders to take them and defenders to defend them. <br><br>* Patrol areas around frontier keeps increased in size.<br> * Number of patrols around frontier keeps increased to account for larger patrol area. <br>* The frontier keeps now control a contingent of strong guards to help defend <br>the home relics. Look for them at the relic gates. This force will diminish as frontier keeps are conquered by an invader. So, an army on a relic raid will be encouraged to take as many frontier keeps as possible to make taking the relic easier.<br><br>The well-trained Lords and guards in the frontier keeps should now be using their bows and spells regardless of distraction.<br><br> An additional "Border keep" patrol should now originate at each of the frontier keeps in the same zone as the border keep to explore the regions near the border keep. Note that this patrol depends upon the home Frontier keep for support, and if this keep is lost, this patrol does not generate for the enemy.<br><br> COMBAT STYLE NOTES<br>==================<br>The bonus damage from a combat style now increases as the skill specialization of the style increases. Before, players would slowly "outgrow" lower level styles as the damage of their base attack increased thus rendering older styles effectively useless. In addition, styles that have openings or are at the end of three style "chains" do additional bonus damage with specialization since they are more difficult to use and happen more rarely.<br><br> 



Monster Encounters:<br><br> The bug causing certain Icestriders in Uppland to be un-hittable has been fixed. <br><br>Horse Routes: <br><br>A couple of new horse routes have been added to Midgard between Gna Faste and Galplan, and Gna Faste and Huginfel. </font></p>

       As stated by the DAoC President, here are some additions to look foward to in the next month...<br><br>

1) Climbing and ladders will be added to the game.<br>2) You will be able to see arrows and ammo being shot by other players.<br>3) Shapeshifting will be added.<br>4) Bounty points (for Realm vs. Realm combat) will be added to the game.  As part of this we will also add a Realm Store where you can redeem your points.  We will also convert each character so that Bounty Points are added retroactively to your character based on the Realm Points you have accumulated so far.<br>5) A new class of weapon effects will be added to the game for things like flaming swords.<br>6) Battlegroups will be added to the game.<br>7) We will look at improving the animations for both water and lava.<br>8)  New weapon animations for skills will be added.<br>9) More unique NPCs will be added to the game.  What we mean by unique is NPCs that require their own special animations/attacks.  These are not NPCs whose type exist already in the game (to which we just add new skins) but whole new types of NPCs.<br>10) More skins for NPCs (as separate from above).<br>11) Ongoing Realm by Realm, Zone by Zone analysis of all parts of the Realms.<br>12) Hibernia will get special attention in order to correct what people perceive it being the "poor stepchild" of the game.  In particular all aspects of the development team will be turning their attention to that Realm (classes, spells, NPCs, dungeons) to improve it and the player's perception of the Realm.<br>13) Increased itemization of certain dungeons and outdoor areas.<br>14) Addition of Epic Quests to 40th level across all Realms.<br>15) Addition of some Epic Quests up to 50th level.<br>16) Addition of more non-Epic Quests.</font></p>

<u>The Members Roster</u><br>
The members page is now active. It's a bit of a rough draft and I'm sure there are droves of people we are missing from it, along with minor information like last names, ranks, and guilded alternates. If you have any information useful in filling the gaps, please feel free to <a href="mailto:shnuggywuggems@yahoo.com">email me.</a><br><br>

<u>Alliance</u><br>
Shadow Gypsies and Ook Ook have officially "tied the knot". Guild leadership will be able to receive "Alliance Chat" and relay any distress calls for help to defend Midguard.<br><br>

<u>Quest for the Emblem</u><br>
After weeks of saving and scrounging up every copper, silver, and gold we could get our hands on, we eventually saved up enough money to get our Guild Emblem! Woot! Thank you to everyone who contributed.<br>
