Only the changes regarding Midgard are included in this.<br><br>

======================================<br>Version 1.42 Release Notes<br>======================================<br><br>NEW CLASS ABILITIES<br><br> - Berserkers now change into a Bear-Person (i.e. a Vendo) when they go into their Berserker Frenzy. The Frenzy ability itself has not changed. We've simply added shapechanging to it. You will continue to hold your weapons, but you will not see your armor (although you are still wearing it). Please note that there is only one bear-person form - male and female berserkers will shapeshift into the same creature.<br><br>(Personally, I would rather see the female bears with boobs =P )<br><br> OTHER NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES<br><br> - Graphical weapon effects are in the game now, so you'll see flaming swords, ice swords, etc. Please note that your current weapon *may* have an effect on it, as we chose to imbue many of the 43-and-higher weapons with effects. We will be adding graphically-enhanced weapons on an on-going basis.  Currently, you can only see your own weapon effects, meaning other peoples flaming swords will look normal to you.  This will be changed in the near future.<br><br>  - A bunch of new monster skins have been added into the game, and a few new models. See the world notes for updates to the monster population.<br><br>  - We fixed a guild chat bug - now, when you quit a guild, you will no longer receive guild chat messages from it.<br><br>  - A bug where following monsters got separated from their leader that caused them to warp erratically has been fixed.<br><br>  - Monsters following leaders will no longer stop and face you when you interact with them.<br><br>  - Guild Realm points will now be tracked much more effectively. Your Guild should no longer "lose" guild realm points randomly.<br><br>  - When you are stealthed, and are attacked, you will now come out of hiding for everyone. Previously under certain circumstances, you'd be visible to some character in the area, but not others.<br><br>  - You can no longer upgrade keep doors unless you have the proper amount of wood.<br><br>  - Keep door material types (i.e. level of wood) will now be saved when a server reboots.<br><br>  - Destroying a keep door will now reset it down to the lowest level of wood - you'll then have to upgrade it from there.<br><br>  - Critical failures in weapon crafting will now cost less materials - you'll lose less when you fail.<br><br>  - You can no longer cast instant-cast spells (i.e. shouts) when you are mesmerized.<br><br>  - In Player vs. Player situations, all "sleep" type spells (mesmerize, stun, root) now can be cast only once per minute per target. This should alleviate some player concerns about being "chain-stunned". You can still cast the spell as normal, however, it will have no effect on a player if he has had that same effect on him in the previous minute. Please note that this change effects only PvP combat - other players and realm-flagged monsters (i.e. guards). Sleep spells cast at normal monsters will act the way they always have.<br><br>  - Leaders of guard patrols can no longer be "directed" around by players.<br><br>  - Bounty Points and Bounty Stores are now in. See the section on Bounty Points and Stores below.<br><br>  BOUNTY POINTS AND STORES<br><br>Bounty points and stores have been added to Dark Age of Camelot. It works as follows: as you accrue Realm Points, you now accrue Bounty Points, which you can spend in special stores to get special magical items. Once you spend bounty points, they go away just like money does. There are three types: healing, stamina , and spell power healing. There are a few levels of these, please see the list below. Please note that will add more bounty store objects over time.<br><br>You can find the Bounty stores in each Realm's main city. See the World notes for the precise store locations.<br><br> You may have a maximum number of bounty items based on your realm rank - i.e. one per Realm Rang. To use a bounty item, the item must be your level or lower - otherwise the item will not work for you.<br><br> To use the item, place it somewhere in your inventory (they do not have to be equipped). Then left click on the item to make a short cut to the item on your hot bar. After this to use simply click on the hot-bar icon. At that point the items spell will be cast and it will disappear. One bounty item may be used every 3 minutes of real time - you can use it while fighting, but you'll have to exit out of combat mode and wait for your weapon timer to expire to do so (usually just a few seconds). Then click the item to "fire" its effect and re-enter combat.<br><br>Higher level objects have more healing power than lower level ones.<br><br> The cost is as follows:<br> level 20 - 100 bounty points<br> level 30 - 200 bounty points<br> level 40 - 300 bounty points<br> level 50 - 400 bounty points<br><br> Midgard<br><br>  Stamina Heals<br> Carved Totem of Heimdal - level 20 stamina<br> Polished Totem of Heimdal - level 30 stamina<br> Embossed Totem of Heimdal - level 40 stamina<br> Encrusted Totem of Heimdal - level 50 stamina<br><br>  Health Heals<br> Carved totem of Eir - level 20 healing<br> Polished Totem of Eir - level 30 healing<br> Embossed Totem of Eir - level 40 healing<br> Encrusted Totem of Eir - level 50 healing<br><br>  Power Heals<br> Carved Totem of Odin - level 20 power<br> Polished Totem of Odin - level 30 power<br> Embossed Totem of Odin - level 40 power<br> Encrusted Totem of Odin - level 50 power<br><br> WORLD NOTES<br><br> Midgard Quests<br><br>Brack - Rollo’s Story: Players are now instructed to return to their trainer in Jordheim, not in Mularn and Haggerfel. Also, Hunters can now complete the quest by speaking to Singrid in Jordheim.<br><br>Bowyer’s Draw: Players will now only need to right-click on Hakon in Huginfell to complete the quest if your quest journal says ‘Talk to Hakon to see if he's finish crafting the bow.’<br><br>Sveawolf Guardian: The wounded sveawolf will now spawn neutral instead of aggressive.<br><br>Cape of the mother wolf: Shadowblades may now do this quest. Speak to Sveck in East Svealand for details.<br><br>Rogue Trainer Quest: Hauk will now reward rogues with experience in addition to money when they complete the Rogue Trainer quest.<br><br>Venture to Gotar: This quest will no longer give out experience, only money. This quest was initially put in to compensate players facing the dangers of traveling from Galplen to Fort Atla at low levels (only vikings and seers that started in Galplen got this quest). With the addition of horses, traveling is safer and we felt it was no longer necessary to reward experience for this quest. Players will still receive 5 silver to compensate them for the cost of a horse ride.<br><br>  Hole of the Dead: Dwarves who have lost or dropped their house gift will now be able to get a new one (ONLY ONE!) from Frimeth in Vasudheim. Return to him and he will give you a new one, provided you have not killed any dwarf bone skeletons. Dwarves just starting the quest will be asked if they need a new house gift. Please do not lose the gift Frimeth gives you, because he will only give you one.<br><br>Spat the Cat: Players that killed Spat, didn’t receive the object, and were stepped to a blank step will now see a journal entry for that step. Kill Spat again and you will receive the object and be placed on the correct step. Players already on step 3 will now receive the object from Spat when they kill him.<br><br>Misc Midgard World Items: <br><br> - Ulfgar for the Price of Excellence quest should be showing up more.<br><br> - Baron Falwur is now associated with a quest rather than a one-time drop. Speak to Darrius in Fort Atla.<br><br> - The Gythja of Bragi in Jordheim will no longer tell warriors to give her the Stormrider’s Hauberk if they already have the War Gauntlets in their inventory.<br><br> - Object – Ring of the Stealthy. The Ring of the Stealthy no longer has a material type of cloth.<br><br> - Level 40 guild track rewards are now ‘no sell’. <br><br>   - Shields have been added as a choice for all level 40 guild track quests. A large shield had been added for warriors, a medium shield for thanes, a small shield for skalds, berserkers, shadowblades and hunters, and a different small shield for shamans and healers. If you wish you exchange your weapon for a shield, speak to Mildrid in Haggerfel. Players may only exchange their weapon for a shield once!<br><br> - The boundary of Vasudheim has been adjusted so that all the buildings are included in the region.<br><br>Midgard Monsters<br><br>Werewolves: We fixed a faction bug with many of the werewolves and wolfaur of Midgard, who were set to an incorrect faction.  Be careful traveling, as all werewolvesshould now be honoring the correct alliances, and previously safe travel may now be unsafe.<br><br>Dungeon Change, Varulvhamm: Some minor tweaks have been made to Varulvhamn, most of which affect the lunarian chamber.  Soloing there may become more difficult.<br><br> - Frostbite wildlings, nip mephits, and snow imps have all taken on a more wintery appearance.<br><br>  - Raumarik is being updated to contain more encounters for higher level players. Work on this zone is ongoing, so be on the lookout over the next couple of versions for new encounters. <br><br>  - Be careful in areas that were once relatively empty and safe for travel, as they may now contain unfriendly inhabitants.<br><br>  - Raumarik: New inhabitants have migrated to Raumarik. The ancient guardians of the area have become more tolerable to those that wish to help rid their once peaceful area of their bothersome neighbors.  Even bounty hunters have been called in to exterminate some of the local wildlife.<br><br> - Added monsters for players level 40 - 50<br><br>SPELL SYSTEM NOTES<br><br> - All spells were gone through and ranges made consistent. No spell was reduced in range, but many were increased, in order to be consistent with spells from other casters, and in some cases with spells from other Realms. The following spells had their ranges increased: Shift Health, Reflect Attack, Inflict Minor Forgetfulness, Wake Senseless, Fungal Dispersion, Grasping Creepers, Fungal Covering, Minor Earthen Power, Minor Shield of Magma, Renew Spirit, Spirit Flow, Hugin's Affliction, Lesser Mind Jolt, Summon Fire, Minor Combustion, Minor Raven Bolt, Misleading Rapture, Minor Lullaby, Detect Flaw, Encourage Aggression, Convert Spirit, Persuade Will.<br><br> - Fixed bug with resistance debuff on Searing Wind line and Minor Raven Bolt. These should properly debuff resistance now.<br><br> Midgard Stores:<br><br> Bounty Stores- <br>Royd – Aesir Temple<br>Elli – Jotun Temple<br>Tora – the Main Hall, with the guild registrar<br><br> OBJECT NOTES<br><br> - All magic item drop rates for dungeons were tuned down slightly, while all drop rates for surface magic items were tuned up slightly. Dungeon drop rates are still  higher than surface drop rates overall.<br><br> - Some of Bri Lieth's denizens were itemized (level 10-20).<br><br>  - The Cap of Mind Bending can now be dyed.<br><br>  - Mantle of bear-like visage can now be dyed.<br><br>  - The Singed Fellwood Shield had the class restrictions removed. Now only classes that can use large shields can equip it. It now raises Strength and Constitution instead of Piety.<br><br>  - The Jewel Dusted Robe now raises the Mentalism skill instead of Mind.<br><br>  - The Ancient Oak Longbow now raises the Longbow skill instead of bow.<br><br>  - The Glowing Sherrie beads is now set with its correct level.<br><br> - The Rangers Charm should have its correct level now.<br><br> - The Encrusted Truesilver necklace should have its correct level now.<br><br> - The Eir Blessed Tunic now can take enamel dyes.<br><br> - The Reincarnated Femur War Maul now has a 2 handed hammer graphic.<br><br> - The Ebony Axe of Mindless Rage now raises Strength instead of Berserk.<br><br> - The Gauntlets of Black Death now raises Strength instead of Celtic DualWield.<br><br> - Winter's Spears now "proc" for appropriate level Hunters.<br><br> - The Riva hauberk (Midgard) can be dyed.</font></p>

=====================================<br>
Version 1.39A Release Notes<br>
December 18, 2001 (4:15PM)<br>
======================================<br>
This is a small update version to 1.39 (released this morning) which fixes some problems introduced then.<br><br>

NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES<br><br> 

- Players should no longer be able to climb the walls of Hibernian keeps.<br>  
- Many players reported getting stuck on objects (such as houses) in the world. This has been fixed. <br><br>

SPELL UPDATE <br><br>

-  Characters with pulsing charm spells should no longer be able to charm friendly NPCs.<br><br>

=====================================<br>
Version 1.39 Release Notes <br>
Tuesday, December 18, 2001 <br>
====================================== <br><br>

NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES<br><br> 

- The Camelot client now properly synchronizes with the server when a player enters the game. Now, your character will not be "in" the game until you are able to control it. Previously, your character would be in the game for upwards of 15 seconds before you could actually control it. This led to your character being slaughtered by monsters before you could do anything about it. We had introduced a temporary workaround, where your character gained 20 seconds of immunity when it first entered the game. This immunity has been removed, so from now on, beware when you enter the game - your character is now immediately "fair game" for any monsters or enemy PCs that are in the area. <br><br>

- The last patch had a change to Hibernian Piercing combat styles - Sidewinder was changed to require an opening style that itself had a block opening. This had the large unintended consequence that many classes (who didn't use shields) could no longer use these styles. So, we're changing it back to the way it was before. Sidwinder now requires as its opening Black Widow. We apologize for the confusion.<br><br> 

- We think we've finally nailed down the last bug that was preventing high level characters from getting combat styles. You should now see all your styles when you log in. <br><br>

- You'll now see arrows fly through the air when an archer fires at a target. When the arrow hits the target, the arrow sticks in the target for a couple of seconds letting the target know the rough direction from which the arrow was fired.<br><br> 

- Players can now climb ladders. To climb a ladder run up to it and continue holding down the move forward key. You'll climb up the ladder. To climb down the ladder, use the move backward key. If you are on a wall and wish to climb a ladder, move backwards and fall off of the wall onto the ladder - you'll stick to it and can climb up and down.<br><br> 

- Monsters now respect doors so that if a door is closed (but not locked) the monster will open the door before going through. If a door is locked (i.e. at a frontier or relic keep), the monster will not come through at all. <br><br>

- You now get a dialog box for confirmation when you give weapon or armor to a guard. <br><br>

- If you have no chance to repair an items, you now get a message telling you just that - previously you would just get a message telling you that you failed, but no mention that you had no chance of making it. <br><br>

- Previously, you could not be interrupted while shooting a bow after you draw the bow but are just "waiting to fire". Now you have a chance of getting interrupted while waiting to fire as well as when you are drawing the bow.<br><br> 

- If you are mesmerized in the middle of a spell cast, you no longer complete your spell when the mez wears off. You now have to recast your spell. <br><br>

- You can now simply type "/who 30 40" to find players of certain levels. Previously you had to type "/who level 30 40" to find the same information. <br><br>

- You can no longer inadvertently downgrade an object by using the "upgrade" command and specifying a lower level than the object's current level. <br><br>

- You can no longer salvage an item for 0 money. <br><br>

- The position of the tradeskill timer should save now when you exit the game. <br><br>

- When a Berzerker or Shadowblade uses the Left Axe skill, the axe in his left hand should now properly check his Left Axe specialization rather than the specialization of the weapon itself (generally Axe) when determining damage. <br><br>

- When an Assassin class (i.e. Infiltrator, Shadowblade, Nightshade) attacks from a hidden position (i.e. when doing a critical strike backstab), the attack cannot be parried, evaded, blocked or bladeturned. Please note that the attacker can simply miss, however, which leaves a bladeturn active.<br><br> 

- There was a bug in the Critical Strike combat style Leaper - it only allowed players to perform it after a parry. Since none of the Assassin characters get parry as a skill, then Leaper could never be performed. This has been fixed by changing some of the Critical Strike Styles: Leaper has been changed to work off a successful Hamstring. Rib Separation now works off a successful Leaper, and Ripper now works off a successful Rib Separation. This makes a powerful 4-style chain.<br><br> 

- There was a bug in Midgard left-Axe wielding which permitted Berserkers and Shadowblades to put a 2-handed axe in their left hand. This has been fixed. You can no longer do this. <br><br>

- Some errors in collision detection around the edges of boundary walls near frontier keeps have been fixed. These errors were allowing players of other realms to "slip" past the frontier keeps.<br><br> 

- When a player trains, he'll be granted all combat styles from previous levels which he may not have been awarded due to skill limitations (parry, evade, etc). This means that if you don't have a skill (such as parry) when you are eligible to receive a combat style that requires it, you will not be awarded it. However, as soon as you gain that skill, you can go back to your trainer, right click on him, and you will be awarded those styles you are now eligible for.<br><br> 

- The troglodyte model has been updated and enhanced with a new skin and corrected model.<br><br> 


WORLD NOTES<br><br> 

RVR Frontier Keeps: <br><br>

- A Forge and Lathe have been added to the following frontier keeps:<br> 
- Albion : Caer Benowyc in Hadrian's Wall <br>
- Midgard: Bledmeer Faste in Odin's Gate <br>
- Hibernia: Dun Crauchon in Emain Macha <br><br>

- Merchants have ventured into the frontier with the various armies and have set up shop selling certain wares related to war. Arrows, throwing axes, and poisons can now be purchased in certain keeps throughout the frontiers, depending on which army holds the fortress. <br><br>

- The guards patrolling in the frontiers have been given strict orders to attend to their patrol routes as opposed to aiding members of their realm with other concerns. <br><br>


Monster Encounters <br><br>

Midgard <br><br>

- The Guardians of Midgard have re-examined their priorities and decided to begin life as neutral to players characters. <br><br>

Midgard Quests / NPCs <br><br>

Quests Added: <br><br>

- All level 40 epics have been added to Midgard. See your trainer for information.<br><br> 

Quest Big Paw: Players on the Big Paw quest will now receive the item when they kill Big Paw in Skona Ravine.<br><br> 

Quest Monsterous Beast: Players who accidently close their dialog box can now resume talking with Vik in the Vale of Mularn. <br><br>

Quest Viking Trainers: Players who accidently close their dialog box can now resume talking with Saeunn in Vasudheim. <br><br>

Quest Copious Striders: The class restrictions have been removed so anyone may do the quest. <br><br>

Quest: Price of Excellence and Quest: Ulfgar's Hammer: There was a bug that allowed players to get the Price of Excellence quest a second time when they went to upgrade their hammer. Players do not need to redo the entire Price of Excellence quest again to get the new hammer (just the Ulfgar's Hammer quest). If you received the Price of Excellence quest the second time, you must return to the drunken dwarf to remove it from your quest list. You will not get a hammer if both the Price of Excellence and 
Ulfgar's Hammer are pending. <br><br>

Quest Widower's Hunt: Yver now sends you to talk to his brother Yric in Myrkwood. Yric will be not despawn after you are finished talking to him, making it possible for more 
than one player to complete the quest. Yver's talk and accompanying journal entries have been changed to reflect this. <br><br>

Quest Waking of the Fallen: Change journal entries so players know to talk to Saydyn in Huginfell before going out to kill Broch.<br><br>

Quest Fervent: Players on step 1 can seek out Wildtooth in West Svealand and kill her to complete their quest. Players starting the quest now have the option of choosing to follow the elder sveawolf to Wildtooth or going on their own. Journal entries for this quest have been updated. <br><br>

Quest A War of Old: Players who are on step 2 of A War of Old and did not receive the Scout Argyle quest can return to Morlin Caan in Jordheim and get it. Players on Step 4 of A War of Old and did not receive the Lt. Salurn quest can return to Morlin Caan in Jordheim to get it. <br><br>

Quest Grenlock Clan: Spiritmasters who received gloves they cannot use can return to Anrid in Jordheim and exchange them for gloves they can use.<br><br> 


SPELL SYSTEM UPDATES <br><br>

- All pulsing spells now print to everyone in the group. A chat channel has been added in the system chat channel picker to turn off all pulsing prints. <br><br>

- Spiritmasters should properly have the Protecting Spirit spell at level 19 in their Summoning list now. <br><br>

- Runemasters should properly have the Suppress Sight line starting at level 11. Previously this list was not being awarded properly.<br><br> 


OBJECT NOTES <br><br>

- The ghastly axe that drops off of Moira the Quiet will now be less powerful and will now be called a screaming ghastly axe. The damage and delay were lowered 3 levels while the stats on the axe remain the same. The item was 5 levels higher than the monster that drops it, so it was not level appropriate. Existing ghastly axes will not be effected by this change. <br><br>

- The polished stone necklace now has necklace icon instead of ring icon.
