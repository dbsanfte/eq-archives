          <P align=left>And the clouds grew dark against the heavens, until even 
            the mighty sun became vanquished by the engulfing darkness. </P>
          <P align=left>It was then that the calm hit. No product of nature could 
            produce such a calm. The trees...they did not sway. The wind...it 
            did not move. The birds no longer sang their sweet song, nor the oceans 
            roar of their vast magnificence. No living thing dared to betray the 
            vast, empty silence that threatened to surround them. </P>
          <P align=left>Then suddenly the earth trembled violently, and the heavens 
            screamed forth! The winds, no longer content with the blackened emptiness, 
            leapt up and slammed into the trees, threatening to tear them away 
            from the pale ground to which they grasped! And the oceans! They were 
            not without their wrath! Great tsunamis of towering height formed, 
            crashing into the frail earth below. The darkened heavens then began 
            to buckle and lurch forth. And in a blinding instant a single bolt 
            of lightning, pure and perfect, reached forth from the sky and slammed 
            into the tallest of peaks below. Two smoldering red eyes appeared 
            in its terrible wake. They peered out intently as the winds began 
            to slow, and the oceans began to flee. 'Kkal Torak' The earth no longer 
            trembled, and the heavens no longer hid. 'Kkal Torak' The glowing 
            eyes then gazed upon the celestial heavens above, where a star began 
            to twinkle gently. 'Master' Lost in thought, they stared off far into 
            the starry night while the wind continued to sweetly sing its name...
