              <font face="Arial">Drakken looked up at the candle, noticing the flame 
              had grown long. It was late at night, of that he was certain, for 
              he heard the soft snore of the Librarian, who had long since fallen 
              asleep. He knew the clue was there, in this tired, old book, but 
              it was elusive, as if it teased him, and then fled away with the 
              shadows the candle's light held at bay. There was something...</font> 
              <p><font
    face="Arial">Drakken sighed, closing the book with an audible thump that reverberated 
                through the now empty library, causing the slumbering librarian 
                to awake with a start. Drakken chuckled to himself as he lumbered 
                to his feet, the rings of armor clinking loudly together as he 
                retrieved his halberd from where it rested against the table.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Done so soon? You've only been studying 
                that book for nearly&nbsp; twenty hours.&quot; D'artagnan quipped. 
                Drakken scowled at the small librarian.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Drakk wants ta take this home. Something 
                there I cannot see.&quot; Drakken replied. The librarian nodded, 
                as if he expected as much.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Dreyn said you might. Go ahead, take 
                it.&quot; said the librarian as he closed some books on his own 
                desk. Drakken nodded in satisfaction, and strode out of the library.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">A few short hours later found Drakken steadily 
                walking towards the Northern part of Ro desert, all the while 
                thinking furiously, as much as he could with his simplistic, Troll 
                mind fate had cursed him with. What was it that eluded him? What 
                was that one thing that he could not grasp?</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;You know, you should carry that book 
                in one of your pouches or something.&quot; Drakken swung around, 
                leaping instinctively back away from the source of the voice, 
                bringing his halberd up to a defensive position. Dreyn stood there, 
                arms crossed. &quot;Get hold of yourself, ugly friend. Don't be 
                so jumpy. Being able to think clearly in battle is more deadly 
                than letting bloodlust or fear grip, and control you mind.&quot; 
                Drakken gave Dreyn his fiercest look.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Drakk know how to fight. Drakk kill 
                many things, won many battles.&quot; Drakk growled. Dreyn chuckles 
                and shook his head.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Do you honestly think those battles? 
                Please! If you were to go to the plane of fear, you would not 
                last a moment! These are but trials, mere skirmishes!&quot; Dreyn 
                said scornfully. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;You dare speak to me like that?!&quot; 
                Drakken roared, on the verge of losing his temper. Dreyn laughed 
                openly, then his face grew deadly.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;I dare speak to whomever I wish to, 
                in whichever tone I wish! Strike me if you dare, Troll, it is 
                time you face reality! I speak of enemies of which you cannot 
                comprehend! I speak of being in the very presence of gods! I speak 
                of powers which can riddle your body...and even mine for that 
                matter, which will incapacitate you mere seconds after the beginning 
                of a battle, ending it before it has even begun! There are things 
                afoot which goes beyond you and I! Things which even the younger 
                gods cannot comprehend, and against my better judgment, it is 
                Shadow Gypsies whom the gods have chosen to carry out their tasks, 
                no matter how important or menial they may seem!&quot; Dreyn's 
                voice was full of venom. &quot;Get this straight, Troll, I think 
                the gods make a mistake with you, but it's my responsibility to 
                be sure that you don't screw up.&quot; Drakken's face turned from 
                that of dark anger to surprise, bordering on shock.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Now that we have that cleared up....you 
                should put that book in a pouch or something. If you lose that 
                book, you lose the clue, and the gods are done with you.&quot; 
                Dreyn finished. Drakk studied Dreyn a moment, then roughly stuffed 
                the book in a large bag, and started walking again.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Tell me something, elfie.&quot; Drakk 
                said, &quot;What is its clue?&quot; Drakken glanced at Dreyn out 
                of the corner of his eyes in time to see him shrug slightly.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;I'm not sure myself. I only know it 
                is a strange book, that one. No one knows who wrote it. No one 
                knows how it came to Neriak library...in short, no one knows much 
                of anything about the book. I have observed that it seems to have 
                a life of its own. Several have tried unlocking its secret, and 
                not a few of them went quite mad while trying.&quot; Dreyn replied. 
                Drakken's eyebrow shot up in surprise.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Oh? Drakk not like the sound of that.&quot; 
                Drakken said, glancing a little apprehensively towards the bag 
                that contained the book. Dreyn chuckled.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;I don't think you have to worry about 
                it. Those who went mad, went mad because they were unable to stop 
                reading it. You have already proven you can control it, instead 
                of it controlling you.&quot; Dreyn smile a bit, then murmured 
                under his breath, his hands creating intricate patters in the 
                air, as he dropped a few chips of bone. A sickly looking green 
                aura rose from the earth, and with terrible determination, the 
                bone chips grew, and fused together, making a skeleton. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;You mean you risked my going mad for 
                a clue!?&quot; Drakken asked, trying unsuccessfully to keep the 
                irritation out of his voice. Dreyn nodded to the affirmative. 
                Drakken sighed in resignation.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;It was necessary.&quot; was Dreyn's 
                only reply.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Drakk guesses he understands, but what 
                about the clue?&quot; Dreyn shook his head.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;All I know is, in a way, the book is 
                alive somehow. The clue will reveal itself when it is ready...when 
                YOU are ready. Just keep reading it.&quot; Dreyn answered. Then, 
                with a bright flash, Dreyn was gone again, leaving the skeleton 
                to topple lifelessly to the ground, like a puppet without its 
                strings.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><strong>Death's door</strong></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">Drakken sat in the dark, at his desk with 
                his chair pushed back, and his hand on the large sword that stood 
                leaning against the wall. It's blackened blade nearly six feet 
                in length, it was a new weapon given to him from a dark paladin 
                of the Shadow Gypsies, Novaji. He had been home only a few days. 
                He had stopped at the lost temple of Cazic Thule to relish in 
                the fear of battle, and had gained nearly a full suit of bronze 
                armor, which now lay under his cot, but Drakken sat in his chair, 
                listening intently, waiting.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">For the past few nights Drakken had felt a 
                forbidding, as if something was about to happen, yet nothing had. 
                Lightning illuminated the office, followed with the harsh sound 
                of thunder, which caused Drakken to flinch. The rain pelted the 
                roof, creating a minor distraction. A sudden thought flashed through 
                Drakken's mind, and cursing himself for not having done so sooner, 
                murmured something in his gutteral troll language, causing his 
                eyes to glow as his vision shifted. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">Suddenly, the room became crowded as the before 
                unseen inhabitants became visible, their horrid, undead minions 
                lining the walls, accompanied by a few shadowknights. With a war 
                cry, Drakken flung a hand towards a nearby skeleton, who was immediately 
                engulfed in a darkness that seemed to feed upon its bones...and 
                suddenly the battle was joined as Drakken swung his large blade, 
                cleaving a nearby shadowknight's skull. More skeletons appeared, 
                announced by a sickly green fog.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Shanna!&nbsp; Kkal! To me!&quot; Drakken 
                thundered, as he lobbed lobbed another spell at a shadowknight, 
                to send him running out the door, screaming in fright, only to 
                be incinerated by a bolt of pure fire as Shanna made per presence 
                known, followed by the mighty Kkal bursting in the room, the embodiment 
                of the storm that raged outside, as he lay about him with a sword 
                twin to that which Drakken was using. For a few moments, the battle 
                raged, spells were cast, and groans of those who died a second 
                time could be heard as their bones clattered to the floor. Then, 
                just as suddenly as they had come....they were gone. Drakken instinctively 
                looked at his desk, and froze. The book was gone with the intruders.</font>
