	Reading and understanding the following rules is KEY!!  These rules have been debated, scrutinized, and pondered 
	by many.  They seem fair.  They are to be followed while attending raids.  It is crucial to the success of our
	raids that these rules be followed.  If at any time a member has an issue with the current rule set, that member
	should bring it up with an officer outside of a raid not during.</font></li>

	Members of the Shadow Gypsies are expected to participate in raiding when they are able.&nbsp;
    It is understood that due to RL conditions or geographical locations, some
    people will not be able to make posted raids.&nbsp; All that is asked is
    that you participate when you can, be active in your guild, and communicate
    to the officers times that you are available for raiding.</font></li>

  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in"><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Verdana" size="2">
	When arriving at the raid, it is your responsibility to let the "attendance monitor" know that you have arrived.  The
	same is true for when you leave the raid.  This should be told in /tell to the person listed as the "attendance monitor"
	in the post listing the raid details.</font></li>

	BE ON TIME.  Many of the places we will be going to will require you to be there when the entire party leaves.  
	Most of us are on for a limited amount of time each day, and we need to make the best of it when we can.  If you plan on
	attending a raid, plan to be there at least 15 minutes before the posted start time.  If you know you're going to have
	a late start, please do your best to have your character camped at the raid start point the night before.</font></li>

	ARROWHEADE'S RULE:  Bitching is not allowed.  If you don't like the rules or the raid, then leave without making a fool
	of yourself.  Do not swamp the RL with /tell complaining about this and that.  As stated before, we are there to have 
	fun and get items.  Sometimes things may not go the way you want them to.  Guess what, it happens to us all.  Suck it up, 
	and let's have a good time everyone.</font></li>

    Warlock robe, abstain from the random for the robe, pass on uber loot to
