              <p><font size="3"><font face="Arial">Drakken awoke to find himself 
                in an evil countenance of a Troll, gifted with the combat skills 
                of his former knight and cursed the evil tendancies and abilities 
                of that necromantic Lich. He searched, and fought, and searched 
                some more... but nothing was familiar, and he did not know what 
                to do.<br>
                <br>
                Finally, he located someone who sounded like one of the Shadow 
                Gypsy knights, and another who had the bearing of one who had 
                followed &quot;The Way&quot; for a lifetime... and finally found 
                Shanna, trapped inside the body of a Dark Elf with evil power 
                still running through her veins. He would find others, but it 
                would take some time, and the gods were not as kind to him as 
                they once were.<br>
                <br>
                So he determined that he and the others had been condemned to 
                a hell far less gracious than mere death. Drakken then set about 
                to identify as many of the old Shadow Gypsies as had been sent 
                to this new hell, and gather them together for some semblance 
                of the fellowship they once had had. <br>
                <br>
                So it was that they turned to Drakken, to fill the shoes that 
                Lan had left woefully empty, providing the leadership they sought. 
                Drakken knew he could not fill those shoes alone, for there remained 
                others who themselves were also &quot;Aegis&quot; of &quot;The 
                Way,&quot; from the old order. Tirelessly Drakken sought them 
                out across Norrath, from the frosty tundra of Everfrost, to the 
                deadly heat of the Ro desert.<br>
                <br>
                And so here we are: Condemned to a world we did not ask for, cannot 
                change, and have very little power to control. We must group, 
                or die. Stand together, or be torn apart. Kill or be killed. </font></font></p>
