          <P align=left>Stepping out of the shadows into Drakken's inner office, 
            I fidgeted with papers on his massive ironwood desk, looking for clues 
            as to what had become of my leader. I found a scrap of a note indicating 
            that he was supposed to be leading a quest for some young trolls -- 
            into the heart of the Feerrott. </P>
          <P align=left>Strange. Nobody had seen him since he left, and the Ferrott 
            wasn't really dangerous to him... </P>
          <P align=left>I left the office and started to search through other 
            papers in his antechamber, wondering if he had gotten sidetracked 
            somehow. That would not be unlike him. I sighed... </P>
          <P align=left>Suddenly, a young troll burst into the guildhall, his 
            tunic ripped to shreds and himself bleeding profusely! "Drak... he 
            beaten bad by bad elfie, and... paleskin stole his RING!". The young 
            troll collapsed before I could get another word out of him. </P>
          <P align=left>"Shamen! COME HERE NOW!" I commanded! Two healers heard 
            me and ran in and began patching up the young troll. "I must leave 
            you now in search of Drakken. See if you can find out anything from 
            this young troll brother and send me a message." </P>
          <P align=left>With that, I vanished from that place. </P>
          <P align=left>An hour later, I caught the trail of the young troll's 
            blood leading from the Ferrott. I followed in reverse... cursing to 
            myself that I had not brought along a tracker. I received a message 
            from a Shaman that the young troll had recovered, but was too terrified 
            to remember anything else of value. </P>
          <P align=left>Right before midnight of the first day, I came upon the 
            remains of three of the four young trolls who had originally left 
            with Drakken, where they had been viciously attacked by beasts or 
            murderers. I examined the site carefully and saw both charred and 
            frozen flesh. MURDER. And worse, murder by magic. </P>
          <P align=left>About 100 feet from where the young trolls died, I found 
            a dead gnome with his skull split in two. Then a little further away, 
            another. Further again, another, and a place where a great troll looked 
            to have been beaten... but there was no body. </P>
          <P align=left>My heart faltered. This is where Drakken had been beaten. 
            I knew it. But somehow, impossibly, he did not die. And in his weakened 
            condition, he must have taken off after those who had slain those 
            in his charge and beaten him by magic. </P>
          <P align=left>I followed Drakken's now cold trail as far as I could 
            -- all the way to Lake Rathe, where it ended abruptly in water. I 
            could not follow any farther alone, or at least without the use of 
            magic and skills not at my disposal.... </P>
          <P align=left>Early the next morning, not wasting my time with petty 
            boats, I cast a spell and flew to the other side, but saw no signs 
            that he had left there by normal means. I went back to the edge of 
            the water where he trail had first disappeared and cast another spell 
            allowing me to see things even the normal Teir'Dal eye could not. 
            I searched a while and in the water found a bent and twisted piece 
            of armor that looked like it could fit a troll. I examined it, identified 
            the Shadow Gypsies guild smithing mark, and knew that it had been 
            worn recently by Drakken or some other friendly troll... </P>
          <P align=left>My continued search revealed nothing, either under the 
            water or around its edge. Until... </P>
          <P align=left>"Looking for something? or someone, rather?" a voice said 
            from behind me. It took me a moment to realize that the language was 
            Teir'Dal. It had been a long time since anyone had used my native 
            tongue, yet... I got up, smoothed out my robe, and turned gracefully 
            to face the person who had spoken. I said nothing. </P>
          <P align=left>"So you have poise, Shanna, unlike your green friend." 
            said a little old man, who was just sitting there on his hands watching 
            me. He was small, almost a head shorter than me, but as I looked he 
            seemed to emanate authority. </P>
          <P align=left>"Aye, but perhaps little time at the moment for idle chatter. 
            Something terrible has happened to someone very important to me, and 
            I dare not dally lest he be lost forever." I almost snapped. Only 
            after I replied did I realize that this stranger had used my name. 
          </P>
          <P align=left>"Patience, young one." the little man replied. "Drakken, 
            yes, I know to whom you refer, is far beyond your reach now, but he 
            is not dead." </P>
          <P align=left>I growled, then calmed myself down. "So did you take him?" 
          </P>
          <P align=left>"Nay, child. I did not." </P>
          <P align=left>"So where can I find him? And what do you know of his 
            captors?" </P>
          <P align=left>The little man smiled. "If I tell you, you would go, and 
            risk your life as well. If I do not, then I perceive that you would 
            continue searching fruitlessly and continue wasting time." He paused, 
            then continued. "Drakken has been taken to Ak'Anon, home of the Gnomes, 
            and is being tortured in the public arena." </P>
          <P align=left>I growled again. </P>
          <P align=left>"Do not be hasty, child." the little man said. "Even if 
            you could get there to free him, you could not bring him safely home 
            alone. You are not yet strong enough." </P>
          <P align=left>"I am stronger than I look, old man." </P>
          <P align=left>"I think not." he said, and cast a quick spell that immobilized 
            me, holding me there for several minutes. I felt completely vulnerable. 
            "You see, I am not the only one in Norrath who can cast that spell 
            or others, and once in the grips of it, an attacker could literally 
            do anything to you." </P>
          <P align=left>To demonstrate, he walked up to me, reached into my robe 
            (all the while I was trying not to blush), took out a magic ring from 
            a hidden panel, and pocketed it. "That will be your punishment for 
            doubting my word." he said. "Do not doubt me again." His eyes glazed 
            over, as if looking far into the distance. "There are three or four 
            Gnomes in Ak'Anon right now who can cast that and worse, and will 
            not be so forgiving to a Teir'Dal intruder." </P>
          <P align=left>The magical grasp on me faded, and I sat down facing him. 
            It was obvious that he was much more powerful than me, so I would 
            try another tack. </P>
          <P align=left>"If you know so much, and care enough about him to tell 
            me, then why don't you fetch him back home?" I asked. </P>
          <P align=left>"Ahhh, so little do you know about me." he said. "I am 
            not permitted to interfere, regardless of the consequences. However, 
            the gods are watching Drakken, and looking out for him in their own 
            way..." He paused again, longer this time, then continued. "I may 
            tell you but one thing more. He will survive if you leave him there, 
            and he will someday return home. But if you attempt to rescue him 
            now and fail, you will both perish." </P>
          <P align=left>I considered the little man and what he had said. But 
            despite his assurances that things would work out, I knew I had a 
            personal duty to try to rescue Drakken. </P>
          <P align=left>"I will go and make the attempt." I stated simply. </P>
          <P align=left>"As you wish." the little man said. But I could see a 
            smile creep into his aged features. "You have much honor and dedication 
            to this Drakken. I believe you may be successful." </P>
          <P align=left>He then pointed his staff at me and cast his blessing 
            on me. "Fare thee well, Shanna. One day, in the far distant future, 
            you shall truly become a force to be reckoned with." With that, he 
            vanished.... </P>
          <P align=left>I stepped into the shadow of the great Wizard Spires in 
            Greater Feydark, and hid in order to meditate upon how best to proceed 
            from here. Traveling was weakening, but not greatly so... </P>
          <P align=left>I cast spells of protection and invisibility upon myself 
            and then set out for Ak'Anon. People of the guild were starting to 
            realize that Drakken was missing, and were asking questions. I replied 
            to none of them. I was too focused on what had to be done. </P>
          <P align=left>I ran until I could see the city gates of Ak'Anon. There 
            were guards, there, but I ignored them. I passed through into the 
            city (a place wholly unfamiliar to me) and hid in the shadows, trying 
            to observe as much as possible before making my move. There were guards 
            all around, as well as gnomes of all types. I avoided them all successfully. 
          </P>
          <P align=left>I sent a message to some guild Druids to meet me in North 
            Karana -- to be ready with healing and other buffs to help Drakken 
            survive the return trip, should I be able to get him out alive. I 
            fielded many questions, but briefly explained the situation and what 
            I was attempting to do. </P>
          <P align=left>I looked around for an hour, and finally found him -- 
            strapped to the outside of the Palace wall, full of open wounds that 
            his torturers kept open to keep him barely clinging to life. I found 
            a shadowed spot and prepared myself for our only chance: that I could 
            get to him, free him, and get him out of there as quickly as possible 
            without him taking additional damage. </P>
          <P align=left>I cast a spell and levitated straight toward him, thinking 
            that this might be easier than I had thought. </P>
          <P align=left>"Invader! Inky!" someone screamed. "Defend the palace! 
            Kill her!" Guards and citizens started to rush toward the palace. 
            But... I might still have a chance if I could get to Drakken first. 
          </P>
          <P align=left>I reached him just as I heard wizards and others starting 
            to cast spells. "Drak! Wake up! It's time to go NOW NOW NOW!" I yelled. 
          </P>
          <P align=left>His huge head barely moved and he whispered "It's too 
            late. All dead. Save yourself." "You old fool." I said as I grasped 
            his massive hand and began to open a gate to the Karanas. </P>
          <P align=left>I was about to complete the incantation when I felt lighting 
            surge through me. And then I felt my body adhere to the wall right 
            next to Drakken. I knew then that I was going to die. I heard still 
            more casting by the gnome defenders. </P>
          <P align=left>"Finish her off!" someone yelled. "Kill the prisoner too!" 
            yelled someone else. </P>
          <P align=left>I turned my head and found my attacker. I stared him straight 
            in the eye as I cast a powerful incantation. Bolts of lightning and 
            other elements surged though him, and he died instantly. As soon as 
            he did, my magic bonds fell away. </P>
          <P align=left>I grasped Drakken's hand again and began to cast, hoping 
            that I would have enough strength left to get us both safely away. 
          </P>
          <P align=left>I cast and saw the city of Ak'Anon fade away. Moments 
            later, I saw the Wizard Spires of North Karana shimmer and appear. 
          </P>
          <P align=left>I faded into unconsciousness, too weak to tell if Drakken 
            had made it along with me, or if had been left to die back in Ak'Anon.... 
          </P>
          <P align=left>I returned to consciousness to hear the sounds of a great 
            battle occurring around me. Wizards, Druids, Rangers, and more were 
            fighting gnomes as they came through the portal after me. </P>
          <P align=left>"Did Drakken make it?" I rasped. "Aye, he did." said another 
            familiar voice. "But you and he are not out of the woods yet. It seems 
            you have angered a few gnomes." </P>
          <P align=left>I sat up and looked around. I spotted Drakken on the other 
            side of the Spires, laid out as if dead, but being attended to by 
            a guild cleric. </P>
          <P align=left>"Rest." the familiar voice commanded. "You have done your 
            part. Now it is time to do ours." </P>
          <P align=left>I fainted again, exhausted in body and soul, the sounds 
            of fierce battle raging around me.... </P>
          <P align=left>I awoke the next morning to find that Drakken and I had 
            been carried to the Dungeon of SplitPaw, and were being attended to 
            in an isolated corner, away from any pesky gnolls... not to mention 
            gnomes. </P>
          <P align=left>I sat up and was greeted by a weary druid. </P>
          <P align=left>"Greetings, Shanna." he said. "You have done the impossible, 
            and yet still live." "I was only doing my duty." I replied weakly. 
            I could feel that it would be quite some time before I could move 
            on my own, not to mention be able to cast spells. </P>
          <P align=left>"Nay, you did an awesome thing." he said. "You and Drakken 
            live, and will be able to fight again soon." </P>
          <P align=left>My concern for the others immediately made me ask: "And 
            what of the others? Does the battle still rage?" </P>
          <P align=left>"Nay, we defeated the gnomes, and left over forty corpses 
            to rot." he said, then paused... "But we lost some good people in 
            the battle as well." </P>
          <P align=left>He named them, friends all, and I began to weep. </P>
          <P align=left>"Cheer up, lady Shanna." he chided me. "They died in glorious 
            battle, and will be given great honor in death." </P>
          <P align=left>"But..." I started. </P>
          <P align=left>"Rest." he said. "When Drakken is up and about, we shall 
            travel again and throw a great party for his safe return." </P>
          <P align=left>Many days later, we made the trip back to Grobb. Drakken 
            was up moving on his own, regaining his strength quickly as only a 
            troll could. I, on the other hand, was still very weak, and had to 
            be helped along every step of the way. </P>
          <P align=left>Once back in Grobb, we threw a great party. We wept over 
            those who had died, but celebrated with those who had lived. I was 
            given great honors, but they felt more like burdens -- reminders of 
            those who had given their lives so that Drakken and I might live. 
          </P>
          <P align=left>After a time, my comrades (including Drakken) departed 
            for further adventures and risks, leaving me alone once more... a 
            solitary Wizard, fated to wander the world alone in search of items 
            with which to conduct my research... </P>
