            <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The
            wind that blew through the Thicket was cold and Thebouy tugged his
            cloak around himself for warmth.&nbsp; He had been hiding now for
            three days and his stomach growled. He ate another root that he had
            managed to find amongst the fallen trees just outside the guards
            wall.&nbsp; He heard the familiar chitter of the beetles as they
            scurried about the Thicket and the call of his friends the wolves.<br>
            </p>
            <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">It
            was three days since the Rivervale Beer Festival and three days
            since Bouy had blown his chances to be the Watchman his family had
            dreamed he would be.&nbsp; For three years he had worked hard to
            build up his reputation and standing in the Vale and he was sure
            that after the Festival that Sheriff Roglio was going to name him as
            one of the new recruits. The Thicket Guard had been relaxed to allow
            as many people to enjoy the fun, The Sheriff had commanded no one to
            engage the Goblins in the hope that they would remain quiet during
            the festival.&nbsp; After the first few hours of the festival, and
            many beers on, he had joined other hopefuls in the Thicket they had
            decided to prove their worth by collecting flowers for the Sheriff's
            Beautiful daughter Mylina.</p>
            <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
            <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Thebouy had bounded off into the
            Thicket to the spot he knew held the rarest and most beautiful
            roses, as he arrived at the spot he sensed that something was wrong.&nbsp;
            Ahead he could hear the harsh grunts of Runnyeye Goblins. It looked
            like as the Watch had been relaxed, to allow as many hobbits as
            possible to make the Festivities, that a large Runnyeye war party
            had formed ready to attack the Vale. Just to his left Bouy noticed
            one of his fellow recruits, Gumble, sneaking through the bushes
            unaware that he was heading straight towards the Goblin horde.&nbsp;
            Bouy did the only thing he could, springing out of the bush he was
            hiding in he shouted at the Goblins. &quot;Here I am! Come and get
            me!&quot; The Goblins turned towards him and their leader screamed
            for them to catch him before he could get to the Watchmen.&nbsp;
            Bouy fled towards the Vale he was pursued by the snarls of the
            goblins and the occasional arrow.&nbsp; He stopped for a moment just
            before a small clearing of trees and hid behind a tree, as the first
            Goblin reached him he readied himself.&nbsp; As the Goblin rounded
            the tree Bouy stuck out his foot and tripped the green skin, who
            fell sprawling into a tree stump. Another Goblin bounded into the
            clearing and swung his rusted axe towards Bouy. Thebouy dived at the
            Goblin's legs, and it fell under his assault.&nbsp; Thebouy realised
            that the Goblin was not moving, he stood gingerly, the Goblin lay
            with his axe buried deep into it's neck.&nbsp; Looking around Bouy
            realised that the main body of the goblin host was headed his way.</p>
            <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><br>
            He saw the entrance to the Vale and a few people outside, he shouted
            at the lounging Watchmen that the Goblins were coming.&nbsp; The
            goblin host poured out of the Thicket towards Rivervale, the hobbits
            ran in fear towards the safety of the Vale.&nbsp; The Watch though
            caught off guard were quick to respond and soon the battle to defend
            the Vale was going their way, as more Goblins fell under the Hobbits
            wraith.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheriff Roglio was surveying the damage to the
            homes outside the vale and the fallen hobbits, his face was full of
            anger. &quot;Why did the Goblins attack us today who caused
            this?&quot; The Sheriff bellowed, as he did Gumble came out of the
            Thicket &quot;It was Thebouy he led the Goblins on the Vale, I tried
            to draw then away back towards the Thicket but Bouy kept shout for
            them to catch him!&quot; Gumble stood up straight and tall.&nbsp;
            &quot;I managed to slay to of the greenskins trying to draw them
            away from the vale, I can show you the clearing!&quot; The Sheriff
            walked over and patted Gumble's shoulder, &quot;Your bravery will
            not go unrewarded, Recruit&quot;, Gumble beamed at Roglio.&nbsp; At
            this moment Thebouy stumbled out of one of the decimated holes
            nearby.&nbsp; Before Bouy could defend himself the Sheriff advanced
            upon him shouting.

            are a disgrace to Hobbit kind Thebouy!&nbsp; You directly disobeyed
            my commands and entered the Thicket and managed to stir up the
            Goblins to attack!&quot;</p>

            Bouy tried desperately to get his side of the story across but it
            was too late, he had blown his chances of being in the watch, as the
            Sheriff would not hear what he had to say. Mournfully Thebouy
            wandered into the Thicket, he had no hope for his future now. So
            that was three days ago and now he sat under the cover of Thicket
            wondering what to do with his life.&nbsp; Suddenly ahead of his a
            figure appeared ahead of him, taller than a hobbit and much more
            lean.&nbsp; Bouy thought this might be one of the Wood Elves he had
            dreamed of meeting.&nbsp; The Elf turned to him and smiled.

            is my name small one. I was in the Thicket and saw what happened, it
            wasn't your fault young hobbit.&quot;&nbsp; Thebouy managed to find
            a smile for the ranger.
            </p>
            <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;

            <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&quot;Looks
            like I have to leave the Vale now and follow a new Path, I just
            don't know what to do.&quot; Bouy stammered, Oerellius smiled and
            put his arm around Bouy's small shoulders.</p>
            <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
            <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
            &quot;I have a possible answer to your problem, you could join my
            Friends the Shadow Makers.&nbsp; They are young adventures who fight
            against the evil of Norrath.&nbsp; If one day you become a veteran
            you can join the elite few who make up the Shadow Gypsies.&quot;&nbsp;
            Thebouy stared in wonder he had see some of the great adventurers
            from the Gypsies in the Vale.
