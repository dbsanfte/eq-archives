<br><br><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">===================================== <br>Dark Age of Camelot <br>Version 1.59 Release Notes <br>Thursday, January 23, 2003 <br>===================================== <br><br><br>NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES <br><br>- Windowed mode and the ability to Alt-Tab have been enabled in the Shrouded Isles client. Remember, you may have significant technical issues when you run the game in windowed mode; be sure to report any problems you find. <br>- Poisons applied to weapons will now save when zoning. <br>- In some cases, when a keep lord was killed (usually by a GTAOE spell), the keep status would not be changed. This has been fixed. <br>- A new command for pets has been added - HERE - which commands the pet to come to your position. Look for it on your pet control window. <br>- The Looking for group system should now work across zones. It stores up to 30 of each type of group leaders or solo players, and displays the zone name. LFG status is now saved when zoning. <br>- You can no longer /INVITE hidden players on PvP severs. <br>- Certain negative effects on the player would not be overwritten by more powerful negative effects (like slow spells). This has been fixed, and will fix a number of style related effect issues that rely on these spell types. <br>- Savages will no longer be able to resist their self parry buff (Nails of Kelgor line). <br>- The Purge realm ability is now properly available to Necromancers. <br>- All Savages now are properly awarded Ignore Laceration at L48 Savagery. <br>- Necro pets now only get item resistance bonuses from their controller (previously resistance bonuses from buffs were being passed down as well, allowing double effects). <br>- Necro power taps cast on monsters now cap the amount of power regained at the monster's current hitpoints or level, whichever is lower. <br>- Necromancers in shade mode can no longer use charged items. <br>- Long macros and macros with commas are no longer cut off when you log out or zone. <br>- Sylvan using Large Weapon combat styles will now animate correctly. <br>- We fixed a bug where sometimes, in rare cases, guild would be created using the same guild number. This led to problems where guild messages of the day showed messages from other guilds, mis-assignment of guild emblems, etc. <br>- The stack sizes of the Spellcraft ingredients have been changed from 1 to 10. <br>- Previously, when you /assisted someone, you would target them but your targeting/summary window would not immediately update to reflect it. This has been fixed and it will now update as soon as you target them. <br>- There was a problem where, when moving stacks of objects, sometimes the quantity designated was not calculated, and only one object in the stack was moved. We fixed, this and now, if you drop a stack on the icon square, it will bring up the stack splitter dialog. Also, if you drop a stack on the text area (next to the icon, where the item name is displayed) it moves the whole stack without asking you. This will allow you to move stacks without any extra clicks. <br>- Previously, when you make a macro with %T, and have yourself targeted, the macro always returned , for your own name. This has been fixed. <br>- There was a bug where the command window would not function after you selected someone's name on the looking for group window. This has been fixed. <br><br>BUYING MULTIPLE ITEMS <br><br>You may now buy multiple items at once. With the merchant dialog open, select an item and Shift-LeftClick on the "BUY" button. It will open a window that allows you to select how many of the item you would like to purchase. LeftClicking the left and right arrows on this dialog increases/decreases the amount by 1, Shift-LeftClicking on the left and right arrows increases/decreases the amount by 10. <br><br>If you click on an item's icon in the merchant window, so that the icon of the item you want to purchase is attached to your mouse cursor, you can use the slash command "/mbuy #" where # is the number (from 1 to 100) that you would like to purchase. <br><br>This will allow you to macro exact quantities onto your quickbar: eg: /macro BUY50 /mbuy 50 <br><br>NOTE: Buying multiple items is the same as if you selected the item and clicked "buy" X times. This means that if you are buy 10 of an item that is already stacked in stacks of 10, you are buying 100 total items. <br><br>SPELL NOTES <br><br>We've taken a long look at Albion's spellcasting classes, as well as the Thane in Midgard, with an eye towards making them more fun to play and functional. <br><br>Theurgist Changes <br><br>- Theurgist elementals can no longer be rooted or mezzed. <br>- Theurgist Confusing Gust line has had its radius raised to 350. <br>- Increased range of Theurgist summons to 2000. <br><br>Wizard Changes <br><br>- Reduced casting time of Burst of Steam line to 2.5 seconds, which matches the Spiritmaster and Enchanter PBAE cast times. <br><br>Friar Changes <br><br>- Increased duration of all Friar self buffs to 15 minutes. <br><br>Sorcerer/Cabalist Changes <br><br>- Increased value on L48 self shield Nullify Offense to 250. <br><br>Sorcerer Changes <br><br>- Sorcerers can now charm any monster type. This should strengthen their Mind spec considerably, and facilitate better charming in dungeons (where many monsters are undead). <br>- Added Minion Control to the Sorcerer RA list. <br>- Increased radius of Fog, Blanket and Cloud of Senility to 350. <br>- Added a power regen buff to Mind spec list so that all three realms have a version of this spell: <br><br>5 Comprehension of Power <br>15 Perception of Power <br>26 Perspicuity of Power <br>36 Cognition of Power <br>46 Lucidity of Power <br><br>- Instead of adding more crowd control to any realm, Sorcerers are getting two new ways of dealing with crowd control. <br><br>1) Added a self mez-duration reduction buff to Mind Spec. <br><br>16 Shield Mind <br>27 Harden Mind <br>35 Steel Mind <br>45 Invulnerable Mind <br><br>2) Added group mez-duration reduction chant to Mind Spec. <br><br>29 Solidarity of Mind <br>39 Unity of Mind <br>49 Brotherhood of the Mind <br><br>General Magic Changes <br><br>- Increased duration of all self-only buffs that had 10 minute timers to 15 minutes. <br>- Fixed a delve bug that affected the "cast time" print. Spells with fractional cast times were truncating the fractional component, so spells with 2.5 second cast times (for example) were listed as 2 seconds. Unless noted elsewhere in the patch notes, no cast times actually changed, they just print correctly now. Please note that spells on the Camelot Herald have always included the fractions of a second; it is only the delve print function that is being updated. <br><br>Thane Changes <br><br>- Removed recast timer from Thor's Minor Bolt line. This is consistent with the Call Mjolnir line, which also doesn't have a recast timer. <br>- Changed Thor's Vigor line from a Strength only to Strength/Constitution buff. <br><br>CLASSIC CAMELOT WORLD NOTES <br><br>- We have revised the dragon AI to provide a more consistent breath weapon use in all three realms. <br>- Midgard Quests: Players working on the "Helping the Svartalfar" quest will no longer be able to get the rabid sveawolf skull from any sveawolf. They must get it from the rabid sveawolf. <br><br>Hibernia Quests <br><br>- The "Famine" one-time drop is now do-able by necromancers. <br><br><br>Realm v. Realm - Frontier Keeps <br><br>- We have added additional camps of higher level mobs for players to hunt at each keep so they can take advantage of the keep experience bonus for claiming a keep. <br><br>- We have modified the spawn of the guard patrols as well as modified the area these patrols cover. The patrols closest to enemy portal keeps have been reduced in number and the area they patrol has been reduced as well. Patrols closest to the border keeps have been increased in number. <br><br>Caledonia <br><br>- The door for the central keep has been moved making it easier for players using rams to damage the door. Prior to this change, rams were not as effective on the door because the door was placed slightly inside the proper location making it very difficult to target. Players will not see a visual change, but the ease in damaging the door should be noticeable. <br>- Monsters: Monsters summoned by Summoner Lossren in the Summoners Hall will no longer drop loot. (already fixed on live) <br>- We have revised the dragon AI in all three realms - in an effort to provide a more predictable encounter, as far as breath weapon use, for Golestandt, Cuuldurach, and Gjalpinulva. <br><br>Hibernia: After having been annihilated by a combination of disease and the brutality of the Fomorians in eons long past, the souls of the Parthelonians have become restless and seek to extract vengeance against the Fomorians and any other unlucky individual that cross their path. <br><br><br>Item Notes <br><br>- The Seafarer's Death Shroud (Midgard) can now by dyed. <br>- Future drops of the Sapling Staff (Hibernia) should salvage for the correct material type. <br>- Gold Stitched Boots (Midgard) should now correctly appear as cloth. <br>- The Feverish Runner Drum (Hibernia) can now be salvaged. <br>- The Ring of Abundance (Midgard) now increases piety, not intelligence. <br>- The Dried Moss Ring (Hibernia) should now equip in the ring slot. <br>- The Mandible Headed Axe (Midgard) should no longer display that it has a proc. <br>- The Deathsight Perfection Bracer (Albion) has had its magic bonuses slightly altered so that it will not continue to generate a "fails to affect you" message. The new magic bonuses are: resist darkness 6%, skill deathsight +6, power +1, stat int +9. <br>- The Poorly Woven Vest (Midgard) has been replaced with a new drop, the Poorly Woven Garb. <br>- The Circle Protector Ring (Albion) can now be worn in the ring slot. <br>- The Spider Keeper's Gloves (Hibernia) now has thrust and body resist, instead of two body resist entries. <br>- The Decorated Seashell Staff (Hibernia) should now salvage for the appropriate material. <br>- The Seething Death Boots (Albion) that are actually leggings have been renamed Seething Death Leggings. <br>- The Sable Boots of Dementia (Albion) now increase slashing and body resistances, instead of having two body resist entries. <br>- The Gauntlets of Mortification (Albion) now increase crushing and cold resistances, instead of having two cold resist entries. <br>- The Worn Mail of Dissolution (Albion) now increases thrusting and body resistances, instead of having two body resist entries. <br>- The Diseased Rat Tail (Albion) now increase spirit and body resistances, instead of having two body resist entries. <br>- The Flesh Stretched Riddle Staff (Albion) now has a Death Servant focus added. <br>- Future drops of the Bear Mask helm (Midgard) should salvage for the correct material. Please note that this does not apply to Bear Masks that currently exist in a player's inventory at the time of this patch. <br><br>SHROUDED ISLES WORLD NOTES <br><br>- Albion Quests: Lost Treasures: Due to a bug, the reward portion of the quest has been restructured. If your quest journal now says 'Step 13 - Choose your second bracer from Ariette' and you did not make a first choice, return to Ariette behind Fort Gwyntell in Dales of Devwy and she will allow you to get your first bracer. Players will no longer be able to get unlimited no-sell, no-trade bracers. <br>- Albion Quests: Players on Ogre's Might who killed Scureol Hyrde and have the Channeler's Orb, but couldn't turn the item in to Master Xavier can now turn the item in and finish the quest. <br><br>Midgard Quests <br><br>- The quest "Silent Death" has been opened to Savages and Bonedancers. Also, ALL rewards for this quest have been changed to "No Sell". <br>- Mammoth Hunt - Savages that received the non-functioning Tusk Bladed Fist can take it to Bothrar Hadd in Bjarkan (Gripklosa Mountains) and exchange it for a functioning Tusk Bladed Fist. Players must have Mammoth Hunt listed in their completed quests to exchange the item. Players may only trade in their Tusk Bladed Fist once. <br>- Bonedancers have been added to the available classes for the Stripe quest. <br>- A woman named Medana has come to Aegir's Landing to help stop Catla Gardasdottir's mad plans. Anyone that is level 49 or 50 should speak to Medana in Dyrfjell if they wish to help. <br>- Mucking Through the Ick: Savages and Bonedancers have been receiving the wrong rewards for this quest. Savages who received the Silkstand Belt (+2 power) can take it to Belyria in Haggerfel and exchange it for the Hardened Silkstrand Belt. Bonedancers who received the Hardened Silkstrand Belt (+HPs) and would prefer the Silkstrand Belt (+power) can also speak to Belyria and exchange their belt. Players must have completed the Mucking Through the Ick quest and have the belt with them to exchange it. The exchange may only be done once. <br><br>Albion Monsters <br><br>- Avalon Isle: Nalsor would sometimes chase players indefinitely or kill them again at their bindstone after they release. This should no longer happen. <br>- Isle of Glass: A drakoran commander has been spotted in the drakoran encampments in the Northwest of the Isle of Glass. It is suspected that he is planning an attack on Avalonian positions in that region. He has only been seen plotting with his underlings in the early morning hours. <br>- Crystal Cave: The Xanxicarian Elite have been toned down slightly. They also chant correctly during battle now. <br><br>Midgard <br><br>- NPC Changes Bjarken: Berge is now a Smith instead of a Vault Keeper. Sisko now sells Dye making supplies and enchanting/recharging supplies. <br>- NPC Changes in Hagall: Alfdis Rannveig is now a Smith instead of a Healer. She has been moved from Bjarken to Hagall. Mikkal will no longer sell spellcrafting supplies for other realms. A new enchanter has come to the town of Hagall. His name is Bolverk and he can be found near the three huts in the town. <br>- NPC Changes in Knarr: Reynilda will now sell Midgard spellcrafting supplies instead of Hibernian ones. <br>- Monsters: Midgard: Iarnwood: The skalds of Aegir are telling tales of a horrible creature named Sariloc in Iarnwood forest. The beast is supposedly very deadly and can reportedly swallow a kobold in one bite. It is unknown if this beast actually exists or is merely a rumor. <br>- Ibicus should no longer spawn inside the bridge. <br><br>Hibernia <br><br>- Cothrom Gorge: Travelers passing by the waterfall have reported that the area now smells of death. There are also reports of earth tremors in that area. Some even claim to have seen the very rock around the waterfall move! Globs of green sludge have been collecting behind the waterfall as well. There is some speculation that the sludge is the source of the foul odor, but others suspect that something else lurks behind the waterfall. <br>- Vigilant Rock: The sylvanshades south of Necht have reportedly appointed a leader as well as placed a scout to watch over the area. <br><br>Treasure Changes in Vigilant Rock <br><br>- The randomly generated objects that dropped from the monsters Rinne, Taiore, and Laraida in the Vigilant Rock will now drop off Tuliros. The randomly generated objects that dropped on Luaire will now drop off Merugat. Tuliros and Merugat roam in the twisted sylvan valley where Luaire and his co-horts are located. <br>- Luaire, Rinne, Taiore, and Laraida have been returned to their normal quest spawn timer. <br><br>Treasure Changes in Vale of Balor <br><br>- The randomly generated objects that dropped from the monsters Adwyth, Drygau, and Anhylaw will now drop off the monsters Cragger and Monger. Cragger (a fomorian) can be found in one of the houses around the Fomorian town area in Vale of Balor. Monger (an ixthiar) can be found in and around one of the tree-trunk houses in the ixthiar area in the Vale of Balor. <br>- Adwyth, Drygau, and Anhylaw have been returned to their normal quest spawn timer. <br><br>Expansion Item Notes <br><br>- Bonedancers may now wear the Stripe Hide Helm. <br>- The bonuses on the Necromancer's initiate gift, Necromancer's Staff, have been changed to match the other caster initiate gifts. Necromancers will now receive a focus staff at level 5 that contains all three of their spell lines. <br>- The Pelted Fury cloak reward given to Runemasters, Spiritmasters, Healers, and Shamans for the "Ota's Quest" the has been altered. The cloak is a multi-class cloak that previously favored runemasters and spiritmasters. The skills have been adjusted so all four classes will gain a skill benefit. <br>- Gazsi's Battle Hammer and Gazsi's Blade (Midgard) should now proc correctly. <br>- Dagda's Cauldron (Hibernia) has been renamed to Cauldron of Clarity to avoid confusion with the relic Cauldron of Dagda. <br>- The Staff of Repugnance (Albion) is now wielded as a two-handed weapon. <br>- The Ring of Tangled Vines (Hibernia) should now equip correctly for Hibernia players. <br>- The Golden Disk Brake (Albion) should no longer display that it has a proc. <br>- The Azure Prayerbound suit of armor in Caer Sidi should now appear as leather instead of studded. <br>- The Masterful Agony Boots (Hibernia) now increase mana magic skill instead of body magic. <br>- The Barkstripper's Scythe (Hibernia) can now be recharged. <br>- The Silvered Leather Jerkin (Hibernia) now has body and slashing resist, instead of two separate body resist entries. <br>- The dwarf Ornulf of Delling Crater should now have Midgard appropriate drops. <br>- The Birghirian Hauberk (Midgard) can now be worn by shadowblades. <br>- Gorvos' Frozen Bardiche (Albion) now buffs crush resist instead of power. <br>- The haunted rowans in Caldey should now be dropping appropriate level unique item focus staves. <br>- The Glacier Jewel with the resistances to cold, slashing, and body should now work at the correct level (47). <br>- The Braided Ivy and Vine Staff now has the correct focus - mentalism. <br>- Albion: Ariach's Purged Staff is now correctly set as a two-handed weapon. <br>- The Darkened Vine Necklace (Hibernia) now correctly increases empathy instead of piety. <br><br>Unique Item Generator <br><br>In the expansion areas and certain dungeons the Unique Item generator is used. Areas that use these see more treasure drops on average than old areas of the game. We had not altered the salvage on the objects to compensate for that fact. The base objects for the Random Item Generator now have a consistent salvage value and are now broken down by size. <br><br>Small items - small weapons, small shields, boots and gauntlets. <br><br>Medium items - medium sized weapons, medium shields sleeves and helms. <br><br>Large items - large weapons, large shields, leggings and chestpieces. <br><br>Metal / Strips / Ore Wood / Leather Cloth <br>S 5 12 18 <br>M 10 24 36 <br>L 15 36 54 <br><br><br>Epic Dungeon Item Notes <br><br>The second pass through the epic dungeons is done. The following changes were made to improve the risk vs. reward in Caer Sidi, Tuscarian caves, and Galadoria. <br><br>- The class set armor pieces are now all level 51. <br>- The reactive procs on those pieces were upgraded. <br>- Many items received increased bonuses. <br>- Salvage was heavily reduced in these dungeons. <br><br>Tur Suil Changes <br><br>- Queen Qunilaria's drop rates were altered. She will now only drop 1 100Q item, with a *chance* to drop randomly generated items. <br>- The Gloves of the Black Archer are now correctly known as the Sleeves of the Black Archer (Albion). <br>- Fur Brushed Chain Leggings (Midgard) can now be dyed and salvaged. <br>- The charges on the Gatekeeper's Reversion Cloak (Midgard) can now be used. However, please note this item is NOT rechargeable. <br><br>Epic Dungeon Notes <br><br>We are closely watching the Risk vs reward in the epic dungeons and will continue to do so. These are the first of possible changes and are geared towards smaller raid groups. <br><br>1) All non-boss monsters in Caer Sidi, Tuscarian Caverns, and Galadoria now drop more coin. <br>2) All non-boss monsters in Caer Sidi, Tuscarian Caverns, and Galadoria had their drop rates increased. <br>3) Numerous treasure table bugs were fixed in the Tuscarian Caverns. <br>4) Lord Lron Should in Caer Sidi should now drop items. <br><br>COOPERATIVE/PVP SERVER WORLD NOTES <br><br>Albion Quests: Free the Rogue! - Animists and Valewalkers should now be able to complete this quest. <br><br>Hibernia Quests: Crace's Desire - players from Albion and Midgard should now be able to finish this quest. <br><br>- All Portal Master NPCs on the PvP/PvE Servers will now respond to the key words [port me]. You must be wearing the medallion of your target destination in order for this to work. This is just an additional method to use the Portal Masters. You can still continue to use them the previous way if you choose. <br><br>PVP SERVER NOTES <br><br>- The maximum level cap for Catacombs of Cardova has been changed to level 45. The delays for the changes in this dungeon are dependent upon the epic quests that some classes may need to complete. For players who are over the level cap and are attempting to complete their epics, we have provided the following options for the PvP servers only: <br><br>- Arc of Ages  Players over 45th level and attempting to perform step 4 can now find the forgotten emperor in Cornwall, west of the Catacombs. <br>- Craft of Retribution  Players over 45th level and attempting to perform steps 5, 6, or 7 can now find and animated version of the Amulet of Fasius Previlus in Cornwall, near the Cornish Giants. <br><br>COOPERATIVE SERVER WORLD NOTES <br><br>- Grand Lord Martel's difficulty has been adjusted. <br>- The monsters that have taken control of Grallarhorn Faste on Gaheris have become stronger. <br>- The "Famine" one-time drop is now do-able by necromancers. <br>- The encounters at Hildskialf Faste, Bledmeer Faste and Nottmoor Faste have had their difficulty increased<br><br></font></td></tr></table>

<br><br><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">===================================== <br>Dark Age of Camelot <br>Version 1.58 Release Notes <br>Tuesday, January 7, 2003 <br>===================================== <br><br><br>RESPEC NOTES <br><br>In order to give players the chance to respec at high levels, we've put in the ability to find objects in the world that will grant the player a realm ability or career specialization respec. <br><br>Because of their extreme power and high worth, these objects are currently found only on the dragons in each realm's mainland. On their death, Golestandt, Gjalpinulva, and Cuuldurach will now drop fifty Luminescent Stones. Half of these will be Full Career Skill respec stones, half Realm Skill respec stones. These stones can be traded or sold to other players as any other object in the game. <br><br>Luminescent stones can then be taken to special new type of NPC (listed below) and turned in to receive the associated Career or Realm respec. <br><br>Please note that after performing a respec, all choices made are your responsibility. Here are the respec NPCs, the objects they will take, and their respec abilities: <br><br>Camelot: <br>Ellette Redding - Luminescent Exerpise Stone  Career Skill Respec <br>Paiton Hazlett - Luminescent Exeregum Stone  Realm Skill Respec <br><br>Jordheim: <br>Tordis - Luminescent Exerpise Stone  Career Skill Respec <br>Haili - Luminescent Exeregum Stone  Realm Skill Respec <br><br>Tir na Nog: <br>Dywana - Luminescent Exerpise Stone  Career Skill Respec <br>Bretta - Luminescent Exeregum Stone  Realm Skill Respec <br><br><br><br>WINDOWED MODE NOTES <br><br>We're holding off on Windowed mode for the time being, while we address some technical and support issues. We'll keep you posted on when it will arrive. <br><br><br><br>NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES <br><br>- NPCs that are charmed and have healing abilities now will generate more aggression. <br>- Necromancers can no longer control siege weapons in shade mode. <br>- You can now use left-axe styles on PVE and PVP servers if wielding Albion slashing or Hibernian blade weapons. <br>- Monsters will no longer accept stacked items as quest triggers. <br>- We fixed a bug where you could have a difficult time picking to select monster in dungeons or in front of objects. <br>- Damage adds are now clamped to be the maximum possible damage you could have done in a swing rather than the actual damage done (which was subject to randomness). This will allow those classes that have damage-adds but cannot spec in weapons (i.e. clerical classes) to once again be able to use damage-adds to help them solo monsters. <br>- When a player in a group casts an AE damage spell, it no longer puts everyone in the group into combat. This will mean that abilities such as Mystic Crystal Lore will now "work" the way they did previously. <br><br><br>LINE OF SIGHT FIXES <br><br>- Necromancers now must be visible to their controlled creatures to perform "pet cast" spells. This fixes the exploit where Necromancers could park their pets in keep towers and wander around outside, and have their pets cast at the Necromancer's target. <br>- Pets of classes such as the Enchanter, Animist, and Bonedancer (and any other class that can cast offensive spells) will not be able to cast spells on a target unless that target is visible to the pet. We expect this fix to take care of the LOS issues for Enchanter-type pets most of the time, but players still may run into situations where the spells are cast even though the pet cannot "see" its target. We will continue to work on this problem as needed. <br><br><br>PVP SERVER NOTES <br><br>We've analyzed the player numbers and level progression on Modred and Andred and are now making some changes calculated to bring up the population of the PvP servers. Based on our analysis, we've found that even though players get more experience from killing other players, they still level slower than on the live servers on average because they take more deaths (both PvE and PvP) than do players on the normal servers. In light of this, we're making the following changes: <br><br>- We've increased the experience gained by killing level 1 - 30 monsters. <br>- Experience for killing other players has been increased. <br>- on PVP servers there's now a 5 minute timer for no experience, realm points, or gold. This timer used to be 15 minutes, which resulted in the majority of PvP kills not generating experience, realm points, or gold. <br>- Low level dungeons (those under 30th level) have been made PvP-safe (i.e. no kill zones). <br>- The maximum level cap for a few of the dungeons have been changed: <br><br>- Cursed Tomb will be capped at 32 <br>- Vendo Caves will be capped at 44 <br>- Koalinth Caverns will be capped at 32 <br><br>- In patch 1.59 (i.e. the next live patch after this one), the maximum level cap for Catacombs of Cardova will be changed to level 45. The delay for the changes in these dungeons are dependent upon the epic quests that some classes may need to complete. It is highly recommended that players on the Arc of Ages and Craft of Retribution quests complete these quests before this change goes live. <br>- In order to ease new characters into the PvP server community, we're putting all newly created characters in a series of "newbie" guilds. These guilds are roughly based on the character's starting location, so all players in the same area will probably be in the same guild. There are four guilds per Realm, each named based on the geographical location. Characters can remove themselves from these guilds by doing a "/gc quit" any time. Please note that characters can technically remain in these guilds for the life of their character, should they choose to do so. Being automatically put in a guild at creation gives new characters an instant chat group and a sense of community with the other players around them. They can discard this guild at any time, and join a player-run guild when they meet the right guild. <br><br><br>SPELL AND REALM ABILITY NOTES <br><br>- Added Determination to the Savage realm ability list. <br>- Fixed some bugs in the power costs of the Animist Sap Strength line. Some were taking no power at all, and some were taking too much. Now all are set to the correct power cost. <br>- The Animist Briar Eruption spell should now be properly awarded at L17 in the Verdant Mastery line. <br>- The Animist Woodspirit Sheath (AOE Bladeturn) line in Verdant Mastery should now pick targets to buff correctly. Please note that it still (correctly) picks random targets in its AOE (up to its maximum), so not everyone in the area will be protected. <br><br><br>CLASSIC CAMELOT WORLD NOTES <br><br>On the PVP and Co-operative servers you can now buy spell crafting materials used by the other realms in each realms major city. <br><br>- In Tir Na Nog look for Morolt. <br>- In Camelot City look for Anyon Becket. <br>- In Jordheim look for Embla. <br><br>Midgard Quests: Bonedancers working on the "Saving the Clan" quest should no longer have to /say Arnfinn to Danica continue on the level 48 portion of the quest. Also, Arnfinn should now respond to Bonedancers and step them on the quest. <br><br><br>Realm v. Realm - Frontier Keeps: Resolved a problem with couriers broadcasting when entering their destination keep region. Couriers should now only broadcast when initially spawning. <br><br>Dungeon: Earthquakes have shaken the Silvermine Mountains, collapsing large portions of the Spraggon Den. The spraggons, confused and disoriented by the earthquake sought a new leader to guide them. Finally, one was chosen to lead them. His first order of business was to rebuild the den. Adventurers on the live servers are warned of this Pendragon note. Please do not log out in the spraggon den, or your character may log in and fall through the world. <br><br>Items: Midgard: The Bonedancer reward 'Odin's Eye Choker' now has the correct skill bonus on it (Bone Army). <br><br><br>SHROUDED ISLES WORLD NOTES <br><br>- The horse from Caer Diogel to Caer Gothwaite will no longer run through the middle of trees. <br><br>Albion Quests: Players working on the quest "Restoring the Magic" should once again find Adelon on the ground instead of too far away to speak to him. <br><br>Albion Dungeon: Krondon: There was an error with the faction of the ogres inside of Krondon where players have been receiving positive faction hits with the faction of ogres inside of Krondon by slaying monsters on the Drakoran Legion faction. We have retro-actively corrected this on Pendragon - and it will go live with the next version. The ogres inside of Krondon will now be aggressive towards all intruders that venture into their domain, regardless of any previous faction gains. Note that this change will not affect the ogres outside of Krondon. <br><br><br>Albion Monsters <br><br>- The hit points and resistances on Apocalypse have been lowered a bit. <br>- Rain elements in Aldland will now disappear when they kill a target and after they have been in combat for 20 seconds. <br><br>Albion Quests: Players stuck on step 5 of "Spirits of the Orchard" can now get their seeds from Tomos by right-clicking on him. If Tomos is not up, players will have to kill Nalsor again to spawn Tomos, then right-click on him. (Note that this change was also read into the live servers) <br><br><br>Items <br><br>- Noguribando's Vest (Hibernia) should now have the appropriate bonus amounts. <br>- Grul's Glorious Trident (Midgard) should now drop at the correct level with appropriate bonuses.<br><br></font></td></tr></table>

<br><br><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">======================================= <br>Dark Age of Camelot <br>Camelot 1.56 Release Notes<br>Tuesday, December 3, 2002 <br>======================================= <br><br>ENTER: SHROUDED ISLES <br><br>With 1.56 comes the launching of Dark Age of Camelot: Shrouded Isles, the first expansion pack for the game. Shrouded Isles is a major upgrade for players of Camelot - it has an all-new graphics engine, an ambient music soundtrack, revamped interfaces, new lands to explore, six new classes, and three new races. With Shrouded Isles, you'll be able to find new weapons and armor, experience a newer, deadlier, monster AI, and loads of new content. As of today, if you have purchased the SI box, you'll now be able to explore the new continents and play the six new classes. For information on the new continents, races, and classes, please visit the Shrouded Isles web site at www.shroudedisles.com. <br><br>A NOTE ON CLASS CHANGES <br><br>1.56 has a lot of class tweaks and balance changes, and new stuff to test. Hunters and Warriors get boosted in melee power. Healing-types now get RP for resurrecting their friends, and we've changed resurrection spells around a bit to support that. There is a new type of healing spells for each Realm's primary healers that will make keeping people alive in RvR much easier. We have also taken steps to address the problems of Assassins being able to fight in melee combat better than we intended. Read through these notes closely.<br><br><br>HUNTER CHANGES <br><br>We've decided to make Hunters more effective in Melee combat. These changes will help them greatly in both PvE as well as RvR: <br><br>- All Hunter melee skills base damages have been increased "behind the scenes". The specific melee skills involved are sword and spear. Hunters will now notice that they do more damage every time they attack an opponent with these weapon types. Hunters now do more base damage than the other two Archer classes, and will not need to do anything to take advantage of this change - it will happen automatically every time they hit with a weapon. <br>- Hunters have been given a new line of spells in their Beastcraft specialization that allows them to insta-cast a wolf pet. This can be done at any time, even in combat. These are shouts that cost 25% power and have a 2 minute recast time. Please note that if a Hunter is controlling a charmed pet, they cannot summon a wolf pet. Here's the list: <br><br>1 Hunter's Companion 80% <br>7 Hunter's Pet 80% <br>13 Hunter's Ally 80% <br>20 Hunter's Protector 80% <br>32 Hunter's Avatar 82% <br><br>WARRIOR CHANGE <br><br>In order to make the Warrior more of a melee damage-dealer, we've increased his weapon skills (again, behind the scenes, as with the Hunter) so that he will do more damage every time he hits with an Axe, Hammer, or Sword (both 1 and 2h). With this change, the Warrior now does more base damage than any other class in the game. Warriors don't need to do anything to take advantage of this change - it will happen automatically every time they hit with a weapon. <br><br>ASSASSIN CLASS CHANGES <br><br>Because of the great advantages Assassin classes - Nightshades, Shadowblades, and Infiltrators - now have over almost any other class in the game (poisons, stealth, devastating combat styles, good base damage, extremely high evade, etc.), we've decided to take some steps to bring them back in line with the rest of the classes in the game. We realize that these three classes are not exactly the same, but they all have a combination of abilities that make them more powerful than other classes of their level. The overall design goal of the assassin is to have them be able to defeat opponents using a combination of stealth and their "backstab" combat style chains. Now, with these changes, they'll have to use more strategy to defeat their target opponents. There's no way to sugar coat this - these steps will make Assassins less effective in direct combat. <br>- We've removed the Ignore Pain Realm Ability from all three Assassin classes. These classes have been granted back the realm training points they spent to get Ignore Pain. It was an oversight that Assassins were given IP at all, and we should have taken it away sooner. <br>- We are capping the maximum amount that any player (of any class) can evade at 50%. Assassins are the only classes that can currently go above this cap, by linking together their Evade 7 ability, plus the Realm Ability Dodger, plus stat bonuses. Assassins will be granted a Realm Ability respec for those who no longer want Dodger ability (as it is usually Dodger that pushes them above 50%). Please note that you will get the realm ability respec only if you currently have Dodger and you are a Nightshade, a Shadowblade, or an Infiltrator. <br>SPREAD HEAL SPELLS AND BATTERY HEAL REALM ABILITY <br><br>The three base healing classes (Clerics, Healers, Druids) now have a new type of healing spell that will help them in heavy battle - particularly RvR - situations. This spell type is called a "Spread Heal". These spells need no target - they search through the group applying healing power to whoever is lowest in health (As a percentage of their max, not as a straight value) until the group is full or the pool has been used. These spells should be especially useful in RvR encounters where targeting is a problem and many people can be taking damage at the same time. In normal PvE encounters or where one target specifically is taking the most damage, directed heals remain the most efficient and effective option. When everyone in the group is low, standard group heals remain the best option. Spreadheals fall somewhere in between - when some members of the group are still full or near full, and some members are falling fast, these heals will be the most efficient option. <br><br>Cleric Rejuvenation spec <br>30 Gift of the Host <br>39 Boon of the Host <br>48 Blessing of the Host <br><br>Healer Mend spec <br>30 Ancestor's Gift <br>39 Ancestor's Favor <br>48 Ancestor's Boon <br><br>Druid Regrowth spec <br>30 Regenerating Spirits <br>39 Resuscitating Spirits <br>48 Reviving Spirits <br><br>Battery of Life Realm Ability <br><br>Also, a new realm ability is now available to the primary healers in each realm at a 10 realm point cost, called Battery of Life, which is a different variety of spreadheal. It allows the user to create a spreadheal pool that essentially remains on him as a battery; checking every round to see if anyone needs healing and applying it when needed just like a spreadheal. If the entire battery is not used, the remaining amount remains on the caster waiting to be used. This ability should also be particularly useful in RvR - it can grant the healer the initiative to heal before everyone in his group starts taking damage. As soon as the group begins taking damage they're already being healed by the battery, and the healer can begin casting another spell which will hopefully be cast before the battery runs out. The battery and the spreadheal used together should go a long way towards allowing healers in RvR to do what they're intended to do - keep the group alive as long as they have the power left to do so. One important difference to note about the battery from spreadheal - it does not flow into the caster, only their group mates. This is not intended to be an automatic complete heal for the healer. <br><br>RESURRECTION SPELL CHANGES <br><br>Due to the recent change where you now receive Realm Points for resurrecting your realm-mates in RvR battles, we've had to change some of the resurrection spells. Here's the list: <br><br>- All resurrection spells now have a 4 second cast time. <br>- The power costs for all resurrection spells have not been changed. <br>- When casting a resurrection spell, you receive a message and the spell cancels if the target is already considering a resurrection from someone else. <br>- Resurrection sickness now goes from 100% to 50% when doing a "full rez" on another player. <br>- Low level resurrection spells now give 5% RP's to the caster and high level rezzes do up to 15% of the RP's to the caster. Mid level ones are between the two. <br><br>RESPEC NOTES<br><br>With the class changes that come with 1.56, we're giving the following respec options to the various classes affected by the changes:<br><br>- all primary healing classes over level 30 get a single-line respec (because of spread heal).<br>- all primary healing classes get a realm ability respec (because of heal battery). <br>- Hunters get a full respec (because of new wolf pets and melee combat changes). <br>- all Assassin classes automatically get the points back they initially spent for Ignore Pain, and IP is stripped from their character, if they had IP to begin with. <br>- all Assassin classes get a realm ability respec if they have Dodger, Ignore Pain, or First Aid. <br><br>Please note that if you meet these criteria, but you already have a respec of the type listed here, you will not get an additional one - for example, if you are an Infiltrator with a Realm Respec that you haven't used, you won't get another one. But, if you are an Infiltrator who does not have a Realm Ability respec, you will be given one. <br><br>INTERFACE NOTES <br><br>- There is a new window - the Command Window - which has two rows of buttons of commonly-used Camelot commands. You'll find things like "attack", "sit", "relic status" and so forth on this window. You can Shift-Left-Click buttons on the Command Window to make quickbar buttons out of them. <br><br>- There is a new "Options" window (displayed by clicking "options" from the character stat/information window). This dialog lets you specify in-game settings like sound/music/ambience/ambient music volumes, and name-color scheme. The Shrouded Isles client has many more options as well. <br>- The mini-info window (comes up when you right click on an item) is now a separate window and doesn't share a window with your target/health window. <br>- There are no longer "white" con color items when you are crafting. When a crafting recipe was on a skill boundary (about to change from red to orange con), it would turn white for one skill point. <br>- When you use a performance configuration slash command or popup command from in game, the changes are saved and should reflect in the main configuration window. <br>- The compass is now on by default for new players <br><br>NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES <br><br>- We now support eight characters per realm per server. <br>- Healing-type classes will now receive Realm Points for resurrecting a friendly player. Please note that you will not get Realm Points for resurrecting someone if they did not "give" Realm Points when they were killed. Also please note that the number of RPs you can get from one resurrection is capped at 2x the RPs that you yourself are worth. <br>- Characters in the main menu will now perform an emote after being selected. <br>- Dying a standard PvE or Suicide fall death should no longer allow you to use the corpse summoner. PvP deaths are not affected by this change. <br>- Corpse summoners can no longer summon corpses while in combat. <br>- Any summoned pet to a ground target should now obey visibility (turrets for animists). <br>- You should no longer see your circular shadow below you when swimming in classic shadows. Likewise, you should no longer see your high definition shadow below you for new shadows when swimming. <br>- Fixed a bug where brush was sorted incorrectly versus rivers in the classic client. <br>- Shadows for large monsters on hills should no longer be clipped oddly in terrain zones from certain angles. <br>- You can no longer load the Expansion zones while running the Classic client. Previously, you could run the expansion client, teleport to an expansion zone, then run the classic client and try to enter with that same character, resulting in either a client crash or you'd end up in an empty zone. Now if you try to enter a SI zone with the classic client, you'll get an error message, and it won't let you load. <br>- The zone loading bar has been moved to not interfere with pretty loading screens. <br><br>NEW EMOTES <br><br>There are five new emotes: <br>- "/ponder" - for when you just want to go "hmmmmmm". <br>- "/military" - a military salute. <br>- "/present" - to present someone with something. <br>- "/taunt" - a very naughty gesture when you really want to insult someone. <br>- "/rude" - a rude gesture. <br><br>SOUND AND MUSIC NOTES <br><br>The new sound options allow independent volume setting for each of the following: <br><br>- Sound Effects: gameplay sounds (combat sounds, spells, etc.) <br>- Music: basically, the MP3s (play when you enter the game, towns, combat music, etc.) <br>- Ambient Sound Effects: random non-music sounds (birds, wind, etc.) <br>- Ambient Music: self-explanatory<br><br>You should be able to set these options in the old Character Select options menu and in the new in-game options menu. Possible settings are: "Off", 1-9 (increasing volume) & "Full" (full volume). <br><br>Sound setting changes made in either the Character Select options menu or the in-game options menu should persist between play sessions. <br><br>Additional Notes: <br>In the Main Menu of the game, you can change the sound settings (via the Options button) but they won't take effect until you enter the game or exit and come back in. However, if you change the settings in the in-game options menu, the volume should change in real time giving an audible cue to the current sound level (if sounds or music is playing at the time). <br><br>In the original "classic" Camelot, you only have 2 sound options: Sound Effects and Music. In this case, the Ambient Effects use the Sound Effects volume value while music uses the Music volume value. <br><br>SPELL NOTES <br><br>- Dexterity buffs now affect casting speed on monsters. <br><br>WORLD NOTES <br><br>The following monsters have had their models changed: <br>- Weakened Demon <br>- red rager <br>- Vrede <br>- flame thrower <br>- Bright Flame <br>- fire phantom <br>- Spirit of Flames <br>- flame spout <br>- Dungeon: Darkness Falls: Marbo, the Sapphire Seal Merchant, will now sell a Corrupted Dismal Vest for Berserkers. <br>- All three dragon lairs have been extended in area (to allow better raid co-ordination) <br>Albion: A new horse route has been added from Snowdonia Station to Llyn Barfog. <br>Hibernia: A new horse route has been added from Brynach to Cursed Forest. <br>Midgard: A new horse route has been added from Gna Faste to West Skona. <br>Midgard: A new horse route has been added from West Skona to Gna Faste. <br>Realm v. Realm - Frontier Keeps: Corpse Summoners will no longer appear at Bledmeer Faste, Dun Crauchon and Caer Benowyc. <br><br>Treasure, General <br><br>- The Radiant Moonclipper (Albion) now salvages for the appropriate amount.<br><br>PvP SERVER WORLD NOTES <br><br>- We've added three medallions of passage to all city medallion merchants. These medallions will port you to the expansion starting zones and will only work if you have purchased the expansion. New Port Destinations: Gothwaite Harbor, Aegirhamn, Grove of Domnann <br><br>TRADESKILL NOTES <br><br>- Fixed the Skill value that the newer Albion Spellcraft gems were set to be more appropriate for what they are <br>- Split the new Albion weapons out to separate lists appropriately <br>- Changed the name of the wizened wood to wisened wood <br>-Added Soul Rending spec and focus gems to Albion Spellcraft: Steaming Fervor Sigil and Steaming Sigil <br>- Removed the Soulrending Focus gem from Albion spellcraft <br>- Fixed new weapon components only using 10th rank materials for Albion and Midgard <br>- Fixed recipes where a "null" object was created in Albion <br>- Fixed all of the icons for the newer weapons to use the appropriate icon for said weapons (i.e. flexible, hand to hand, and scythes) <br>- Fixed weapons that are leather, instead of metal, to have their DPS progress normally <br>- Fixed issue with Midgard Alchemy, Herbcraft, etc, not showing up properly <br><br></font></td></tr></table>

<br><br><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">======================================= <br>Dark Age of Camelot <br>Camelot 1.55 Test Release Notes <br>Monday, November 25, 2002 <br>======================================= <br><br>THE LURIKEEN UPRISING HAS PREVAILED <br><br>- As of this patch, Lurikeen can become Heroes. Thanks for the great roleplaying moments to everyone involved in the Uprising. Enjoy! <br><br>NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES <br><br>- We have made it so you can no longer duel in cities. Peace has once again been restored to crafters. <br>- Fixes a problem where archers would play one frame of a combat swing animation after killing an opponent with a bow. This was a client animation problem only - it didn't actually affect bow shot times, and it appeared randomly. <br>- Couriers should now honor all pathing geometries and should obey zone wall boundaries. <br>- Realm guards should now follow leaders and maintain speed with leader. This should also fix the aggro problem when realm guards would lag behind and not aggro on enemies. <br>- We have implemented a /GROUNDASSIST command on the server. By using this command, your own groundtarget assumes the same location as your targeted player's ground target. This allows for a "front spotter" who is possibly stealthed to set a ground target for a siege equipment controller or spellcaster. <br>- We fixed the delving of combat spell abilities - these were printing incorrectly. <br>- When you upgrade an outpost you are setting a desired level on the outpost. The level will only increase or decrease one notch per 6 minutes. <br>- Performing a successful Guard or Intercept no longer causes an interrupt to a caster who is guarded. <br>- Level 51 cloth armor should now get the correct amount of bonus levels. <br>- Legendary crafting titles should now set and display correctly. <br>- Bards can now hold and use staves (although they cannot train in them). This is a longstanding bug. All classes should be able to hold and use staves. <br>- You can no longer put proc effects on jewelry, cloaks or instruments to artificially boost their level. <br>- Monsters will no longer attempt to cast a 20th concentration effect repeatedly. <br>- The Realm Abilities First Aid and Mystic Crystal Lore can no longer be used in combat. Using them in combat was a bug, and it is now fixed. <br><br>HELM PROBLEMS <br><br>We are halfway through transitioning to a new, better system of displaying helms. This system will allow us to create new helmet graphics much faster, and allow them to fit player models much more effectively. Please be aware that there may be some display issues with some helmet/race combinations until we fully migrate to the new helm system. <br><br>REALM POINTS FOR RESURRECTING NOTE <br><br>Please note that on Pendragon, we've been testing a system that gives classes that can resurrect their fallen comrades Realm Points for doing so. For now, we're holding off rolling this system live until we've worked all the kinks out of the system, based on the concerns of the Pendragon community and the team leads. So, none of the Pendragon resurrection-specific spell changes that you may have read about in the various 1.55 test release notes have been implemented in this live version, which includes getting Realm Points for rezzing, decreased casting times for higher-level rezzes, etc. <br><br>RVR CHANGES <br><br>- We have made it so you can gain experience points for engaging in RvR and killing, or helping to kill, enemies. You will not lose experience when you die, but when you kill an enemy, you will now be awarded "normal" (i.e. as if the enemy was a monster, based on level) experience for the kill. Thus if the player is blue to you, you will be given normal "blue" monster experience for the kill. Please note that there is a known bug currently in this system where under some circumstances if you are grouped you won't get experience for a group-member's kill. We are looking at this problem right now and will fix it as soon as we can. <br><br>SPELL NOTES <br><br>In advance of Shrouded Isles, we have taken steps to correct a longstanding spell issue. Several spells allow casters to buff lower-level characters without adhering to a cap of any type, thus enabling lower-level characters to be able to fight monsters far above their level, with almost no danger. This allows low-level characters to level far faster than intended. We want these spells to help low level characters, but not without a cap of some type. <br><br>So, these Damage Add and Damage Shield spells are now capped, so they will no longer give 50th level damage-per-second to a 1st level character. However, given that some players are used to being able to do this, we have made the cap higher than it normally would be - you'll still be able to help out lower level characters with these spells, but not to the extremes that existed up until now. <br><br>Please note that we have implemented this on a sliding scale as per the rest of the buffs in the game. If you are a mage that has these spells, the lower level you are, the less this change will impact you. The most impact will be from an extremely high mage (i.e. 40+) buffing a 1st or 2nd level character. The damage allowed slides up from there. <br><br>SIEGE WARFARE NOTES <br><br>Siege damage has been flattened across the entire area affected. In other words, there is no drop off from a direct hit and someone at the edge of the bolt. <br><br>Additional types of catapult ammunition have been added to the ammunition stores. Note that the cost of existing ammunition has been raised, to be more in line with the new ammunition: <br><br>- A catapult bullet - which is a higher damage, low area shot. <br>- Grapeshot - which is a lower damage, high area shot. <br>- A ball of ice - which is similar to the existing catapult stone, but does cold damage. <br><br>The "power level" of all siege ammunition has been increased. This should lead to higher, more consistent damage when using these weapons. <br><br><br><br>WORLD NOTES <br><br>- Many of the Midgard NPC's have removed the robes favored in enemy lands, and replaced them with appropriate Midgard vests. <br>- Dungeon: Summoner Hall: Grand Summoner Govannon should no longer be able to heal himself multiple times in the course of combat. <br>- Darkness Falls: Beliathan can no longer be fought in the tunnels of Darkness falls, however, he will now linger longer in the room when he spawns. <br>- Hibernia: Touched now correctly resembles the diseased Celt that he is. <br>- Albion: We have added a bindstone near Swanton Keep in North Black Mountains. The Snowdonia Relic keep (Albion Power) was the relic keep that was the farthest from any bindstone. This bindstone should provide a binding location for Albion players who wish to defend this relic. <br><br><br>Realm v. Realm - Frontier Keeps <br><br>Keep Lords - At low health, the Keep lords will now summon help from the courtyard and the new "personal guard" spawned at keep upgrade level 8. Given their newfound confidence in their allies, keep lords will no longer use their anti-bladeturn abilities. <br><br>- When a keep is upgraded to level 8 - 4 additional Keep Guards will spawn near the lord room. <br>- If you take over an enemy's keep and that realm has at least one of your relics, if you upgrade the keep to level 10 it will spawn a corpse summoner NPC. If you die in PvP and type /transfercorpse "keep name" without the quotes your corpse will transfer to that keep, although you will still need to be resurrected once you get there. Note that enemy players can kill this NPC and if they do so, the /transfercorpse command will be unavailable to you for that keep until he respawns (in one hour). <br><br>TRADESKILL NOTES <br><br>- Fixed the higher material Wrought Jewelry Boxes so they are able to be made correctly now in Albion. <br>- Fixed the stable leeching tincture recipe so that it creates the leeching tincture and not the ablative tincture. <br>- In Albion labeled the stable leeching tincture recipe correctly. <br><br><br></font></td></tr></table>
