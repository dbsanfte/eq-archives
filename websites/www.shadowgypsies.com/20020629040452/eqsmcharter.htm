time is just as valuable to him/her. Our clerics are all more than willing to help a
fellow SG out with a Rez. However, if you need to get a rez, it is your responsibility to
work out a time that works for the both of you. Don't expect clerics to drop what they're
doing immediately because you've waited until there's twenty minutes left on your corpse
before a rez is no longer available. As well, it is your responsibility to help the cleric
in any way you can by dragging corpses (when possible) and helping to arrange for ports.</p>

may be stripped of their rank by the Guild Leader immediately and without question if said
Officer has violated the terms of their duties. In such a case, the Guild Leader is simply
required to post notice on the member&#146;s message board and that the Officer had been
stripped of title with a recounting of the incident leading to the removal of title. A
more elaborate post may also be made on the Officers&#146; message board. </font></p>

Guild Leader does not have the authority to strip an Officer of rank without cause. Cause
is determined in the same way as cause for &#145;Removal of Membership.&#146; If any
Member feels an Officer should be stripped of their rank, a message must be posted,
discussion held, and a vote taken requiring a strong majority of all Officers voting in
the affirmative that an Officer should lose rank. A situation may occur where the Guild
Leader may feel it is necessary to strip the rank of an Officer on the spot. If such a
situation occurs, the Guild Leader must post an accounting of the situation with the
reasons for stripping the title, at the earliest opportunity. A discussion and vote will
then be held, and if the vote by the Officers does not confirm the Guild Leader's
decision, that Officer shall have his rank restored. </font></p>

If you choose to use the Guild Fund to help you with a Trade Skill you must train to
MASTER level before using the guild fund for your next Trade Skill. (NEW MEMBERS CAN NOT
USE THE FUND UNTIL THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE GUILD FOR 30 DAYS - DOES NOT APPLY TO ALTERNATE
CHARACTERS.) </p>
