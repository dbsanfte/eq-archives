<br>
<font color="#ffff00">Rank 1 - Lieutenant</font><br>
<br>
Old school officers of the guild who have been with us for several years. They are trusted to run the guild when the Captain isn't around, and to carry out things for the good of the guild on their own initiative.<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffff00">Rank 2 - Seargent</font><br>
<br>
Crusty old members who have shown unquestionable loyalty to the guild. They have officer powers and are responsible for it's day to day functions. In addition, they are responsible for rounding up the troopers for missions into the field, the pillaging of nearby dungeons, or rounding up bail money. Whichever the case may be. This is an earned position.<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffff00">Rank 3 - Veteran</font><br>
<br>
Members in good standing that have shown a desire to further the guild. They have also survived: in the trenches, various brothels, numerous o.d.'s of various substances, brawls, diseases, plagues, famines, massacre's, butcheries, charges, retreats, withdrawls, victories, defeats, suicide missions from the Captain, and yet STILL show up to collect their weekly paychecks. This is an auotmatic position upon reaching the level of 35.<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffff00">Rank 4 - Troopers</font><br>
<br>
The meat and potato's of the guild. When not storming enemy battlements you can find these ladies and gentlemen in various dens of inequity or avoiding officers of the law (in various dens of inequity). This position is automatic upon reaching the level of 20. If you joined us already past the level of 20, you will be promoted to trooper after a 2 week trial period as a Recruit.<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffff00">Rank 5 - Recruit</font><br>
<br>
Entry level position. During this time we will have the opportunity to evaluate you as well as an oppurtunity for you to evaluate us. If you are able to stomach abuse pretty well, or can even think of some new and inovative ways to abuse us, you may be pleaded with to stay. =) That is, if you survive the life of a hard nosed Gypsy before an elf gets the chance to shoot ya in the back. This is a required 2 week position.
