			<div align="left">
              <font size="3">
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The beginning of the end started 
                when a rampant evil overtook the world, and great evil beings 
                arose who could not be put down. The evil infected the souls of 
                many, and doubts began to grow even among the mighty Shadow Gypsies 
                -- that even they would not be able to win the war. Several knights 
                were corrupted, and fell apart from &quot;The Way&quot;, some 
                never to be seen again... and others seen again in evil form spreading 
                the poison of evil throughout the rest of the population.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Kingdoms were rent asunder 
                by the mighty forces the dark powers brought against them. The 
                Kings, Dukes, Earls, and all the rest got together and determined 
                that they had to work as one in order to rid the world of the 
                evil menace. It was then that they called upon Lan, &quot;Keeper&quot; 
                of &quot;The Way,&quot; and leader of the Shadow Gypsies, to lead 
                the forces of good in a great campaign against the forces of this 
                new, but ancient, evil. </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">So Lan led the armies of the 
                combined kingdoms against the undead, pushing them back towards 
                the abandoned Castle Victoria, and it was then that the foe seemed 
                to disappear altogether. It seemed as if the clouds rolled back 
                and the sun shown once more. But it was only the eye of the storm...</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Until that time, the leader 
                of the undead armies had yet to show its face, or to make its 
                presence known to the world of Meridian. Yet, even as the undead 
                armies seemingly disappeared, a group of necromancers worked to 
                resurrect their master, the Lich Queen, who still lay, seemingly 
                asleep, in the bowels of the abandoned, and long-forgotten dungeons 
                of Brax.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Unsatified with the armies 
                sudden disappearance, and seeming retreat, Lan journeyed with 
                his personal apprentice, Drakken, to the famed libraries of Castle 
                Burgouise, where Princess Katriina dwelt. There, he studied tirelessly, 
                as a man obsessed, for somehow he knew that something horrible 
                was on the horizon. Long had his Mentor, Quanag, the old orc wizard 
                warned him of 'a storm on the horizon,' and it seemed as if it 
                was here. The Keeper knew his destiny was at hand.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">As Lan bent over one an ancient 
                tome he had dug up, on the third evening of his studies, he froze, 
                barely breathing, as his eyes scanned again the passage he had 
                just read. Drakken looked up, as Lan pushed the old tome aside, 
                and seemed to cross reference something from another tome, and 
                his face went white. </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">He read of an ancient ruler 
                of a people long extinct, long before the gods had come to Meridian. 
                Her name was of the ancient language, much of which remains undecipherable, 
                but ended up sounding like &quot;Ten'yuv'al.&quot; </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">As History would have it, 
                the queen fell in love with a trabadour, named Tendrath, who died 
                an untimely death. The queen then became obsessed with unlocking 
                the secrets of death, so that she might be with him again. Yet 
                evil twists the mind, and the body, and the queen unleashed an 
                evil for which she was unprepared, dooming not only herself to 
                a liche's existence, but also those of the kingdom were hideously 
                deformed in such a way that, though the flesh decayed off their 
                bones, they would not die. </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">One wizard, however, was able 
                to resist the curse. Klavis Verge, fought the Lich Queen herself, 
                casting a strong enchantment on her, causing her to slumber. Then, 
                he sealed Brax it by magically creating an elevator that could 
                only be opened by powerful magic from the outside, then vanished, 
                never to be seen again. So it was, that the doomed city of Brax 
                remained forever forgotten.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">In a rush, Lan and Drakken 
                tried to marshal the combined armies of the kingdoms again, but 
                the nobles, with the exception of the rebel Jonas D'accor refused, 
                thinking the battle won. So Lan, the Shadow Gypsies, a few of 
                the other orders of knights, and those who followed Jonas D'accor, 
                started their journey to the hidden city of Brax.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">During the journey to Brax, 
                one of the great Knights, already corrupted by the servants of 
                the Lich, began to plot against the others. He willingly offered 
                aid, but laughed to himself when a great Knight of any Order fell 
                to the minions of evil. Three orders of strong knights were completely 
                eliminated as repeated ambushes were repelled as they journeyed 
                towards Brax, each more frenzied than the last, yet not one Shadow 
                Gypsie fell to the sword.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Lan pushed the armies hard 
                using the skills of a new apprentice wizard, Shanna, to strengthen 
                them in their race against time, but as they crossed the threshold 
                of the Brax, Lan knew they were already too late as the sounds 
                of death heralded her awakening. The forces of good were halted 
                in their tracks as they met the necromancers, and inhabitants 
                of Brax head on, causing fully half of their number to fall on 
                that one day, and were forced to fall back.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The fighting continued, and 
                days turned to weeks, and weeks turned to a month, and their numbers 
                dwindled. Now, several orders of knights were completely decimated, 
                leaving only a few knights from each that were now without a master. 
                Of those rebels that followed Jonas, a scant one hundred remained, 
                and all those remaining were long since battle weary.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The Keeper fell into a foul 
                mood as he began to have doubts where none were before. Never 
                before had he dealt with such a strong foe...and never before 
                had he felt the beginnings of defeat. So it was he called Drakken 
                to him, instructing him to prepare for a final assault. If they 
                were not successful this time, they never would be.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">They again found themselves 
                enthralled in fierce fighting as they pushed their way the dark 
                passages, twisting corridors, and hordes of undead that were thrown 
                in their way, eventually gaining entrance to a place they had 
                not seen before, and had their first encounter with the queen 
                herself. With a roar the remianing combantants thrown back by 
                a force stronger than any had ever witnessed, many were killed 
                instantly, including the remaining armies of the careless queen, 
                and the others who were still alive ran in blind fear never to 
                be seen again.&nbsp; Lan, Drakken, and Shanna staggered to their 
                feet to see the Lich coming toward them, raising her had for another 
                spell. With a roar of enraged defiance, Lan released his anger 
                as he ran towards the queen, his magical sword raised. The Lich 
                released a fireball, knocking Lan on his back, charring his face. 
                </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Lan howled in pain an fury 
                as he regained his feet and charged again. The Lich's face registered 
                surprise a split second before Lan closed with her. The battle 
                between the Lich and Lan raged back and forth, the lich blasting 
                Lan with spells which were buffered by his magic armor, and Lan 
                striking the Lich with his sword, causing wounds which seemed 
                to heal as quickly as they appeared. Yet the battle began to tell 
                on Lan, as his parries became more pronounced, and he began to 
                weave on his feet. The Lich's face at last lighted with glee as 
                she reached for Lan with her hand, prepared to suck out his very 
                soul.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&quot;No!&quot; Drakken shouted, 
                yet held immobile by the terrible spectacle before him. Drakkens 
                exclamation, however, seemed to snap Shanna out of it, and she 
                knew what she must do. With grim determination, She began to cast, 
                releasing a bolt of purest electicity, stricking Lan dead before 
                he hit the ground - and before the Lich could reach him.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&quot;Noooooooo!&quot; the 
                queen howled. The Lich struck at Shanna with her hand, and Shanna 
                instantly consumed, as the Lich turned toward the remaining Drakken. 
                </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Drakken jumped back as the 
                Lich lashed out with a power that was unknown to this world, and 
                yet another battle ensued, the Lich with a strange, evil light 
                in here black eyes, and Drakken with a strength borne of desperation. 
                On and on they fought, until both were weary. It was then that 
                it happened...</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The Lich and Drakken circled 
                one another, neither attacking...or so Drakken thought. Yet while 
                they Drakken began to feel weaker with every step, and less 'connected' 
                to himself. The Lich smiled, as if receiving some kind of aphrodesiac, 
                and promtly stumbled upon the rubble of bones. Seeing his change, 
                Drakken leapt forward, his sword cleaving the Lich's head from 
                her shoulders. </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Instantly, the ground began 
                to shake, and the very pillars of Brax began to groan as the world 
                felt the death of the Lich. Drakken stood in astonishment, not 
                believing the end had come with such a finality, yet....there 
                was something wrong. Something terribly wrong....</font></p>
              
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Drakken's face contorted in 
              pure terror as he felt himself slipping towards the warm embrace 
              of death, and the cold realization that his body was no longer his, 
              and his soul was quickly becoming displaced and set adrift. Perception 
              faded....</font>
