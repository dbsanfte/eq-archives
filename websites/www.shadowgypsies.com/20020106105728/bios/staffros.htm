  <p align="left" style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#808080">All
  is dark, tonight in the world of Norrath.&nbsp; From the region of Antonica to
  the realms of the planes of Fear and Hate, it seems like there is no stir as
  the dark forest of Nektulous sings with the night sounds of what lurks in the
  dark forest.&nbsp; Nektulous, dark even when it is day.&nbsp; Eons ago, it
  seems, when the Lavastorm Mountains erupted, the ash and brimstone from the
  volcanoes filled the air.&nbsp; It seemed that nothing would ever grow in this
  jungle forest any longer; no animal life, no plant life, and certainly no
  intelligent life.&nbsp; But the gods of Norrath are not to be taken so lightly
  and faithfully.&nbsp; They do as they will, and care not what even their
  followers may think.&nbsp; Not true gods are they, but just begotten remnants
  of whom once were powerful men and women of whom many follow and put their
  faith in.&nbsp; These poor souls will never know that their faith is but a
  drop of rain in the Ocean of Tears.</font></p>
  <p align="left" style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left" style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#808080">So,
  after time went by, Nektulous did strive, and although the clouds of smoke and
  ash blocked the forest from receiving light from the sun, it thrived after
  all.&nbsp; Plant and animal life alike live in this forest.&nbsp; Shadow
  wolves, spiderlings,&nbsp; moss snakes and more all roam the land of the dark
  forest.&nbsp; These creatures could have wondered in from any of the out lying
  areas in which many animal kins of theirs live.&nbsp; As well as these
  animals, creatures of the night, the undead; skeletons, mummies and zombies
  take a role of the essence of Norrath.&nbsp; The strange thing about Nektulous
  is that it also spawned an intelligent species, and not just a species that
  can barely be considered intelligent, but a highly developed species of elves,
  with very high intelligence.&nbsp; Unknown as to how this species of elves
  came to this land of Nektulous, many myths surround their existence.&nbsp; If
  one of these elves were to be asked as to the beginnings of their existence,
  they would tell you they were created for Nektulous and Nektulous created for
  them.&nbsp; These elves known for their ability to see in the dark (this
  ability is no doubt, an acquired ability developed over long periods of time
  due to the dark and shadowed nature of where they live), are consistently
  thought of as evil, the Dark Elves.&nbsp; While most of the race of Dark Elves
  are evil and have mastered the arcane arts of necromancy and wizardry, some
  stray from the evilness of the rest of the pact and become well verse in the
  healing techniques of the cleric.</font></p>

  <p align="left" style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#808080">Burrowed
  in a mountain side, the city of Neriak exists.&nbsp; An intricate series of
  tunnels and rooms make up this city with three city areas.&nbsp; Included in
  these areas of the city are many guild halls for different classes of dark
  elves, a bank, many merchants, trainers, and guards.&nbsp; Befriending the
  Dark Elves are the Ogres and the Trolls who have set up a camp of their own in
  one portion of the city.&nbsp; In this city is where we find our character, a
  dark elf necromancer named Staffros Deneccros.&nbsp; In the following pages
  you will find the journal and inner most thoughts of Staffros (Staff, as he is
  known by friends and members of his guild).&nbsp; The world of Norrath has
  many treasures as it does creatures, monsters and beasts.&nbsp; Take a journey
  to a mystical world filled with enchantment, magic, and horror.&nbsp; Ride
  along with Staffros as he lives his own journey and grows to become a
  competent and successful user of the dark arts.</font></p>

  <p align="left" style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#808080">Dark
  and damp is the city of Neriak, lying amidst the dark forest, Nektulos.&nbsp;
  Through mysticism and wonderment, yet unknown to all races, another soul
  appears.&nbsp; Norrath, unlike other worlds where a being is born of a mother
  and a father, spins in an unlikely manner.&nbsp; The races of Norrath, somehow
  just appear from seemingly nothingness.&nbsp; Unknown for sure if it is the
  power of one omnipotent deity, or the combination of a tribunal of deities.&nbsp;
  For some reason or another, this part of the history of Norrath is either lost
  or inexistent due to the fact there is no lineage to hand down from generation
  to generation.&nbsp; So in confusion, beliefs are guided by a way of living
  each individual is born to.</font></p>

  <p align="left" style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#808080">In
  the midst of a Neriak, in the area known only as the Third Gate, yet this
  spectacle of mysticism takes place.&nbsp; A new soul is born.&nbsp; Rolls of
  thunder echo throughout Neriak, lightning and flashes that mezmorize the mind,
  none like Norrath has ever seen.&nbsp; From old stories handed down, they tell
  of a being created by Inorruuk's own mold, with like abilities and that he
  would be &quot;The One&quot;.&nbsp; Could this new Dark Elf be &quot;The
  One&quot;?&nbsp; Born; for the lack of a better word, creation may be more
  fitting a term, this day in Norrath rises a young dark elf.&nbsp; Given the
  title of necromancer and the name Staffros.&nbsp; Later, through Staffros’
  journeys and experiences he will be able to choose a surname.&nbsp; For some
  unknown reason, whether it be tradition or law, surnames may not be chosen
  until one reaches his 20th season of his life circle.</font></p>

  <p align="left" style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#808080">Born
  with a given intelligence and abilities, this young necromancer makes his
  presence known.&nbsp; Created with a note in hand, to be delivered to a
  seasoned trainer, Staffros will begin his jouney.&nbsp; Upon delivering this
  note, he receives instruction of how to conduct himself and experience the art
  of necromancy.&nbsp; A training tunic place upon his back, to show his loyalty
  to the art which now becomes his religion.&nbsp; Money, experience, and other
  desirable needs he is not born with, these tasks he must carry out himself.&nbsp;
  Spells and conjuring he must learn.&nbsp; He is necromancer, master of the
  dead, evil his domain.&nbsp; Arcane in itself, necromancy is considered a
  threat to some, feared by most, but respected by all.&nbsp; To some,
  necromancers only worship themselves and give homage only to hate and evil.&nbsp;
  But there is something different about this necromancer, something that glows
  within him.&nbsp; A light in a dark soul has sparked.&nbsp; Not yet tapped,
  but burning still.&nbsp; Over time, this light will either be extinguished or
  fueled, but this is decided by which path Staffros takes.</font></p>
