Congratulations are in order to our two newest epic members.  Both Ueudayyanaa and Kenil went epic last week.  This is a huge
accomplishment for them both.  Please congratulate them the next time you see them.  Screenshots can be viewed <a href="Screenshots7.htm"> here.</a>

More work is in order for the website.  I know that I keep saying that, but I've been super swamped in RL lately, and I have to 
save some time for EQ.  :)  Once again, many thanks to Milladarau for all the hard work she's doing in helping me keep 
up with the site.

Many thanks to Milladarau for all the hard work she's put into helping me with the website.  The girl's too damn good.  I can't keep up 
with all the stuff she wants me to do.  Thanks to her, the member's page is uber updated now.  All the members are listed in alphabetical
order, level's should be up to date, and inactive members have been removed from the list.  When you see Mill online, give her a big pat 
on the back and say thanks for all the hard work she does for us.

Look for new pages to be added to the website soon.  I'm working on a guild charter for us.  As well, I intend to update the Info Archive
with some new information, and I should be adding the Luclin maps soon.
<br>
<br>
Keep an eye out for upcoming events.  Between SG raids and ROS raids, there's something to do nearly every night.  Show up, participate
in the events, have some fun with your guildies, and have a chance to get some uber loot.  What could be better?  Wait,,, I got it.  4 HiV 
on a stick might be better!!

I've made quite a few changes to the website for this update.  The members page should be updated, I've added a new
vertical link bar which cleans up some old, dead links.  As well, this link bar contains a link to our <a href="eqraidrules.html">
newest page </a> dedicated to raids.  With time, I intend for this page to grow with a calendar and raid results.
We have many raids scheduled for the upcoming week.  Please refer to the member's message board for upcoming events.

Congratulations are in order to Trik Star for making level 60.  As if he wasn't a tough enough little rogue, now all the
uber experience he gets will be going to arch abilities.  Congrats BRO!!</font>

In the meantime, I'm going to work on an automated way of keeping it up to date so you see the changes reflect ASAP, and, frankly,  I won't have to mess with it.  Also, once I get access to the message board, I will be granting access to our new members.
