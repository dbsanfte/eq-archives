            will be to update the member's page. This is going to take some time 
            guys. The best I can do at this time is sort through the existing 
            members roster on the member's message board. In the meantime, I'm 
            going to work on an automated way of keeping it up to date so you 
            see the changes reflect ASAP, and, frankly, I won't have to mess with 
            it. Also, once I get access to the message board, I will be granting 
            access to our new members. </font></td>
