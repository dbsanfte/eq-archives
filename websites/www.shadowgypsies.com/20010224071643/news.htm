      <blockquote> 
        <p><b>November 8, 2000</b> - Wow, I updated the news section. Basically, 
          the big news is that I've taken a job with Artifact Entertainment (creator 
          of the Horizons MMORPG). Check out the <a href="http://www.horizonsvault.com">vault 
          page</a> and the <a href="http://www.artifact-entertainment.com">main 
          website</a> and write me a message to let me know what you think.</p>
        <p>In EQ style news, we've created a splinter group on Xegony, and are 
          working on getting enough players there to form the guild properly (without 
          having to use dummies). If you're interested in joining us there, give 
          a tell to &quot;Jadcea&quot; if you see me online. And on Rallos I've 
          transferred guild leadership to Parrin, who has been a good friend (in-game 
          and real-life) for quite a long time. But I'm maintaining overall guild 
          leadership regardless, because I feel strongly that the Gypsies are 
          a family, and will transcend games from this point forward much more 
          easily than we did when migrating from Meridian 59.</p>
        <p><b>June 2, 2000</b> - Not to be outdone by Mance, Parrin, Oxcarz, Frith, 
          and I dropped <a href="images/Lugoj.jpg">Lugoj</a>. He was even impressed, 
          cause he hasn't been beaten in a while.</p>
        <p><b>May 28, 2000</b> - Mance, being the good steward he has been recently, 
          sent me some screenshots of recent PvP encounters. <a href="images/maelduine.jpg">Maelduine</a>, 
          <a href="images/nallaren1.jpg">Nallaren</a> &amp; <a href="images/nallaren.jpg">Nallaren</a>. 
          I'm sure there will be more, and not just from Mance... <a href="images/brann.jpg">Brann</a>, 
          <a href="images/Bopop.jpg">Bopop</a> &amp; <a href="images/bopop2.jpg">Bopop</a>.</p>
        <p><b>May 23, 2000</b> - Guild rogues, cry for me. <a href="images/Trex.jpg">Here</a> 
          is the TRex (Trakanasaurus Rex) that dropped Trak's Tooth (10/20 rogue 
          piercer) that I LOST the roll on. Ylar (unguilded necro) got it and 
          refused to trade.</p>
        <p><b>May 21, 2000</b> - Many of us have benefitted greatly from Kunark, 
          and our list of lvl 49+ members is growing stronger by the day. We've 
          hunted in many zones, several dungeons, and gotten a few nice items 
          in the process. And we've also died many times as well to things that 
          just seem to have a few more Hps or attacks than we can stand (ala City 
          of Mist and the Goo). But overall, we're doing well... We're adding 
          new members regularly, and even promoting a few from the <a href="http://www.shadowmakers.com">Shadow 
          Makers</a> so things are looking very very good. Congrats on our progress!</p>
        <p><b>April 24, 2000</b> - Ruins of Kunark opened today, and several folks 
          I know are already lvl 51. Several of you have not or will not receive 
          your expansion CD, and to be honest, I don't know what you're missing 
          yet... that will have to be seen once we explore a bit of the new continent, 
          new spells, and the new Iksar race.</p>
        <p><b>April 16, 2000</b> - Humor</p>
        <p>Ya'll gotta take a look at this pic someone put together. It's a riot.

        <p><b>April 9, 2000</b> - Kedge Results</p>
        <p>Frith wrote: Well I sure feel like Kedge was a success. We had a few 
          deaths at the beginning while we were getting everyone in place. Rest 
          assured I learned from this small problem and will do my best to avoid 
          it in the future. </p>
        <p>Once we set up however, we pulled spawns and slaughtered them. We moved 
          to spawn points and slaughtered them. Not a single person died during 
          this. We killed fish... We kiled sharks... we killed voracious pirahnas... 
          we killed mermaids. We killed the GoldenHair mermaid placeholder... 
          We killed the CauldronBubble placeholder... and then we killed big old 
          CauldronBoil himself. Tharaver got a real cool lookin sword. We did 
          not have enough clerics or enchanters or tanks to feel good about taken 
          on Estreela but we had to save something for another day. </p>
        <p>Thank you to everyone. People listened better (particularly after the 
          deaths) then on any hunt I have ever led. Shanna and Myutin did fantastic 
          jobs leading the parties. Tharaver bravely held his ground as the only 
          tank. Poxxpoxx was very busy with a variety of buffing and mezzing duties. 
          Parrin, Uraken, Hazezon, and Mordnatyr were fantastic nukers and doters. 
          And last but certainly not least was Demay whose healing prowess even 
          managed to keep me alive as the puller. Frith</p>
        <p>NOTE: Frith did a remarkable job in researching what was required to 
          survive and pull in that environment. His prep time paid off in a big 
          way. &gt;Shan</p>
        <p><b>April 3, 2000</b> - Quite a bit has happened in the last month, 
          not all of it good. But we have started working together very frequently 
          (grouping up for exp and more) and in fast reaction to PKs or PK attempts. 
          A few times we haven't gotten there quickly enough (which is typical 
          considering the size of Norrath) but other times we catch the killers 
          with their guard down. Yesterday's <i>Royal Rumble</i> was a great success, 
          even tho this is one wizzie who had my head handed to me on a silver 
          platter at least once...</p>
        <p>Also, thanks to several members prodding me on numerous occaisions, 
          I have reinstated the <a href="kos.htm">KOS list</a>, which you can 
          get to from a few places on the site and the messageboard.</p>
        <p><b>March 11, 2000</b> - Today marked the death of 2 sphyx in Rathe 
          Mountains, and the Ishva Mal (named Gnoll), who was kind enough to drop 
          the &quot;Summon Corpse&quot; spell and his brain. Thanks for all who 
          participated! It was short work, but fun nonetheless.</p>
        <p><b>March 7, 2000</b> - Flushed out a bit more in the History section, 
          but it appears that I did not get all of the storyline transferred from 
          the old shadowgypsies.com to the new... so am missing some pieces. If 
          anyone can help fill things in, I would really appreciate it. I need 
          to get from the end of the last &quot;Revealing Shadows&quot; section 
          to the &quot;Finding of the Way&quot; and then figure out where we need 
          to go from there.</p>
        <p><b>March 7, 2000</b> - Today, we welcome back Tiaka to our ranks. For 
          the last X weeks, she has assisted as second in command to the Shadow 
          Makers, and has done well in that capacity. But alas, her true home 
          is with us, and she joined us again last night.</p>
        <p><b>March 2, 2000</b> - Anyone with Dreamweaver experience who has some 
          time to help with the website, please <a href="mailto:shanna@shadowgypsies.com">contact 
          me</a> via email. I can't do all of the guild management, history/storyline 
          writing, website design/maintenance AND have any time to play the game 
          as well. </p>
        <p><b>March 1, 2000</b> - As you can see, we've yet again made some changes 
          to the site. Hopefully we'll find this more easily maintained and can 
          keep it updated regularly. I could really use some help, at least in 
          maintaining this news section.</p>
