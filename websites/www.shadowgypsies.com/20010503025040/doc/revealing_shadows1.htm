    face="Arial">Drakken grumbled darkly at the reports on his desk. The armies 
                of the dark races have again been mustered. Legions of young dark 
                elves, trolls and ogres, attempting to storm towards Qeynos, for 
                the glory of the dark gods. Such a useless conflict, it seemed. 
                Used only relieve the mundanity of life.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial">&quot;The 
                gods were right. You are a strange troll.&quot; Drakken stood 
                up, tipping his chair back, and reaching for a nearby weapon at 
                the unexpected voice. Then he stopped in shock at the sight of 
                a dark elf standing just inside the door, small even by dark elf 
                standards.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial">&quot;Who 
                in Hades are you, little man. I do not like unwelcome visitors. 
                Leave here before I decide your existence is useless.&quot; Drakken 
                growled. The small elf smiled impudently.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial">&quot;I think 
                not.&quot; he said, as he made himself comfortable, &quot;Unless, 
                of course, you wish to never find that which you seek.&quot; Drakken 
                stood motionless, in indecision, then finally sat down again.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial">&quot;What 
                could <strong>YOU</strong> possibly know about &quot;The Way?&quot; 
                He asked. Something about this dark elf made Drakken glad he had 
                not decided to fight him.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial">&quot;Only 
                that you must find a book, or books rather, for the information 
                you seek. The gods look favorably on you and yours, though why, 
                is beyond me.&quot; the little man said. Drakken raised an eyebrow 
                in slight surprise.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial">&quot;Just 
                like that? Just find some books?&quot; He asked, then chuckled. 
                &quot;When Lan had &quot;The Way&quot; revealed to him, he had 
                to prove himself worthy of it. Why is that different now?&quot; 
                The little man laughed lightly.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial">&quot;Oh, 
                you will prove your worthiness, my ugly friend. For you see, Lan 
                was not strong in body, yet to prove his worth, he had to do things 
                that would require strength. You, on the other hand, are not strong 
                in mind. Thus, you will have to do things which require that kind 
                of strength.&quot; the little man answered. Drakken's countenance 
                darkened, and his hands opened and closed, wishing for a weapon.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial">&quot;Weak 
                mind, am I? I who have learned under Lan, and who has proven himself 
                worth of knighthood, then was given the honor of being Aegis, 
                and now to lead those Shadow Gypsies which remain? Weak minded?&quot; 
                Drakken lashed out with a huge fist, and promptly was thrown back 
                by a bright flash of light. The little man now stood, looking 
                angry.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial">&quot;I would<strong> 
                NOT</strong> do that again, Drakken Soulblighter. I do not wish 
                to be the ones to tell the gods I killed you because you could 
                not keep yourself under control&quot; He said, his voice deadly 
                quiet. Drakken knew fear then. Not the fear of war, or of conflict, 
                but the fear of being horribly outclassed in sheer power.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial">&quot;Well 
                then, I guess the rest of the information I have to give you will 
                have to wait, since you are not ready yet. Your petty outburst 
                of anger has shown me that!&quot; he said. Drakken started to 
                get a sick feeling in his stomach.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial">&quot;Wait! 
                I am ready!&quot; Drakken exclaimed. The little man merely smiled, 
                as he did when he first entered.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial">&quot;I think 
                not.&quot; He said, as he vanished.</font>
