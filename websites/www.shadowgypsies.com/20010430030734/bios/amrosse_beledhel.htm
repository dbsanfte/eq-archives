          <P align=left>Not many think of elves as living within the cold, northern 
            Antonican Tundra. I am one of these such elves. I lived many years 
            of my life in the snowy clutches of the Everfrost Peaks' tall, white 
            walls. I would return many a time even after leaving whenever my travels 
            would be so fortunate to take me their way. </P>
          <P align=left>I know nothing of who my birth parents were, or what happened 
            to them. I know only that I was abandoned to the cold tundra snow, 
            left to die. I was found quite luckily by a kind Barbarian woman after 
            being in the cold outdoors for only a short time. She took me and 
            raised me as her own for she had had no other children of her own, 
            nor would she ever. </P>
          <P align=left>In her earlier years my foster mother, Di as I called 
            her, was a great warrior of the Wolves of the North. They were the 
            great protectors of the Barbarian city of Halas, and the surrounding 
            Everfrost Peaks. The Wolves of the North were kind, just and had to 
            be the strongest, and biggest warriors one would ever see in his life. 
            The female warriors were these, but also some of the smartest and 
            most strategic warriors one might see. </P>
          <P align=left>Di taught me all she could of the warrior's way of life. 
            She taught me not only in the warrior's trades but also in other skills 
            used in life courtesy, fairness, justness, strength, and above all 
            to never give up. You were to fight to the very end, and never give 
            up. Whether this be in some quest of yours, or just another fight 
            with an attacking thief on the road. I have always headed this and 
            all her other lessons. </P>
          <P align=left>When I was old enough, and there was nothing left that 
            could be taught me, I was sent to Kelethin to train with the Emerald 
            Warriors. Though I had learned much from Di and the Wolves of the 
            North they could not train me to my full potential me being not of 
            the same race. So I had come to train with my blood race the elves. 
            Who I had never met a single soul. </P>
          <P align=left>The Emerald Warriors immediately took me in of course 
            me being such a strange type of warrior. My training started the very 
            day after me and Di's arrival. I was sad to leave the only family 
            I had known, but also excited at the same time with all the experiences 
            I dreamt to be in store for me. </P>
          <P align=left>After sad goodbyes with Di, and many warm welcomes from 
            the Emerald Warriors I started my new life. There were more new and 
            exciting experiences for me than I had ever imagined. I made new friends, 
            helped protect Kelethin form Orcs and Pixies, fought against an invasion 
            of evil Dark Elves, Trolls, and Ogres, and started numerous new trade 
            skills that I would use all throughout my life. </P>
          <P align=left>I soon found that not all Dark Elves, Trolls, Ogres, and 
            even Orcs are not evil. One such Dark Elf being Shanna. A lovely wizardess 
            of the Dark Elven race. Shanna introduced me to the Shadow Gypsies 
            and they soon took me into their guild. There is nothing else to tell 
            for I cannot tell the future. We shall just have to let the story 
            of our lives unravel and see first hand what the future has in store 
            for us all. </P>
