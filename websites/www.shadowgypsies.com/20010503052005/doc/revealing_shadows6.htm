          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">Drakken's head was 
            bowed as he stood over a large pile of stones, somewhere in the Rathe 
            Mountains. It had been hard, the past few days, as he helplessly watched 
            Kkal slowly die from the poisoned blade that has struck him in his 
            vicious fight to save the book. Questions filled his mind, as he again 
            replayed the events of the past few days, but was interrupted by someone 
            nervously clearing their throat.</font> </p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Sir.&quot; Drakken 
            looked up, and saw Whitefalcon, then remembered of his missing informant.</font> 
          </p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I hate to interrupt 
            sir, but Shanna received this as a result of Alendar's travels...I 
            just received it myself, from Orcaa.&quot; Whitefalcon said, producing 
            a note, and a small bag.</font> <font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">As 
            Drakken scanned the note, his eyes grew wide, then he smiled viciously. 
            Then, opening the bag, Drakken began to laugh for the first time in 
            days.</font> </p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Good, White! 
            We are nearly there!&quot; Drakken exclaimed, slapping White heartily 
            on the back. White smiled, his sun-browned features splitting into 
            a grin.</font> </p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I've a friend 
            in the Neriak library, a necromancer by the name of Lims. See if you 
            can find someone to deliver this bag to her and...&quot; hurriedly, 
            Drakken made an additional note on the parchment he had just received, 
            &quot;...give this note to her as well. She will know what to do.&quot; 
            Drakken ordered, giving the bag and the note back to Whitefalcon.</font> 
          </p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;She'll get it 
            by the end of the day, Drakken&quot; Whitefalcon affirmed, before 
            turning and trotting off.</font> <font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">Drakken 
            turned back towards Kkal's resting place, and knelt to pat one of 
            the stones.</font> </p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Old friend, 'The 
            Way' is very near returning to us...I wish you could be here.&quot;&nbsp; 
            Drakken said, his voice rough with emotion. Standing quietly to his 
            feet, Drakken started towards Grobb...</font> </p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2"><b>A New Hope</b></font> 
          </p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">Lims was deep in study, 
            her brow furrowed as her concentration became even more intense. It 
            had been mere minutes since Shanna herself popped into view, along 
            with Whitefalcon, who handed her the small bag and note. Scowling 
            at the presence of a lightdweller in her presence, Lims grabbed the 
            items uncertainly.</font> </p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Uh-huh, just 
            as I thought&quot; Lims muttered, while Shanna and Whitefalcon waited 
            nervously.</font> </p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;What is it?&quot; 
            Shanna asked.</font> </p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Well,&quot; Lims 
            answered, turning towards Shanna, &quot;Using this information I've 
            received, I could do a spell of &quot;Revealing,&quot; but I'm afraid 
            I am missing a vital component.&quot; Shanna raised an eyebrow.</font> 
          </p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;What is it you 
            need?&quot; She asked.</font> </p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I need 4 Kerra 
            Isle beetle eyes.&quot; Lims said, closing the reference books she 
            was using. Shanna nodded, then muttering some words beneath her breath, 
            vanished in a bright flash of light, taking Whitefalcon with her.</font> 
          </p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">Drakken jumped, as 
            both Shanna and white appeared before his desk in a flash of light, 
            scattering papers as he instictively groped for his sword. Seeing 
            that it was Shanna, Drakken muttered, then began picking up papers 
            that had fallen to the floor.</font> </p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Don't you ever 
            knock?&quot; Drakken said sarcastically. Shanna just grinned.</font> 
          </p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;No, too much 
            work involved.&quot; she replied, laughing softly. Drakken scowled 
            at Shanna, then chuckled.</font> </p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;What brings you 
            here, Shan?&quot; He asked.</font> </p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;We need 4 kerra 
            Isle Beetle eyes, but to be honest, in light of recent events...I 
            really am too tired.&quot; Shanna said. It was then that Drakken began 
            to notice dark circles under Shanna's eyes, and her slightly famished 
            look. </font> </p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I know how you 
            feel.&quot; Drakken said,&nbsp; motioning his hands towards the mounds 
            of paperwork on his desk. &quot;Take a few days off to go to a funeral, 
            and this happens.&quot;</font> </p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Tell you what, 
            I'll have Parrin gather..hmm...Nelix, Silverbrook, and a couple others 
            to journey there. He can teleport them to Qeynos, then take the boat 
            from there.&quot; </font> </p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Thank you, Drakk.&quot; 
            Shanna said. &quot;I'll go tell Parrin you wish to speak to him.&quot;</font> 
          </p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Fine, after that, 
            you should go to bed.&quot; Drakken said, shooing Shanna out of the 
            office.</font> </p>
          <p><b><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">Shadow Raid</font></b> 
          </p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">The raid went as 
              planned, but took nearly 3 times as long as what was thought in 
              order to acquire the beetle eyes.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">But what we would do with them has yet to 
              be revealed...</font></p>
