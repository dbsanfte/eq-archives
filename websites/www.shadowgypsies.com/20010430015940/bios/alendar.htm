          <P align=left>Alendar usually 
            did not like to reveal much about himself, but the easy way Drakken 
            talked to him, and the way the Shadow Gypsies had taken him in helped 
            his tongue loosen. Then again, maybe it was the mass quantities of 
            Dwarven Ale consumed that had him speaking freely...he still wasn't 
            sure.</P>
          <p align=left>Born in the deep, 
            dark forests of Faydwer, Alendar does not remember much of his family. 
            His father was a ranger, and his mother a druid of the forest, past 
            that and the knowledge of very caring parents he is at a loss. His 
            parents were killed by a vicious orc attack while Alendar was out 
            hunting one day. He returned home to find his home in ruins and the 
            orcs leisurely dining on his family’s food stores. For a long while 
            he could not move, only stare in fright and disgust. Finally one of 
            the orcs noticed the young elf standing at the edge of the clearing 
            and raised an alert. A quick shot with his bow turned the sounds of 
            alert to sounds of agony, and the young elf was off through the forest, 
            with the orcs in close pursuit. The orcs were gaining on him and caught 
            him as he stumbled over some branches. A roaming guard from the large 
            city of Kelethin came upon the band and saw them beating upon the 
            small elf. The guard easily dispatched the orcs and turned to see 
            Alendar lying prone on the ground...</p>
          <p align=left>Alendar awoke 
            in a small building. His head spun as he tried to sit up, and a soft 
            feminine voice told him to lay back down and that food was on its 
            way. While he ate he learned that the Scouts of Tunare took him in 
            after the guards brought him back to the city, and that he had been 
            unconscious nearly 3 days. Over the next week Alendar’s strength returned 
            to him, and with it a burning hatred of the filthy orc race. After 
            a little convincing from the Scouts, Alendar finally realized that 
            he would be no help to his slain parents if he were to try to hunt 
            down the orcs now. The Scouts began to train him, and assist him in 
            his journeys. But Alendar was young still and impatient, his journeys 
            began to take him further and further from the Tree City he now called 
            home. He soon found himself amongst the dwarves in ButcherBlok Mountains 
            and the city of Kaladim, though he soon departed after a small taste 
            of dwarven hospitality. He made his way to the docks and decided he 
            needed to see more of the world. Sneaking onto the boat was an easy 
            thing for the nimble young scout, staying hidden when the first bouts 
            of seasickness hit him was another thing all together. After, what 
            seemed like ages to Alendar, the boat finally set port in a large 
            human city called Freeport. Again hospitality did not seem to be the 
            strong point of these strangers, whether it be cries of disgust at 
            his appearance and the shouts of rogue or the distaste some had for 
            his heritage, it was not an easy place to be. Alendar made the best 
            of it though, and decided that if he were to be called a rogue, then 
            he would act the rogue. Freeport is where he learned to pick pockets, 
            for money to buy himself food, and many other rogue skills.</p>
          <p align=left>Through all this 
            time though Alendar was still searching, searching for what he did 
            not know, hoping someday he might find whatever it was he was looking 
            for. His travels took him far and wide, to the Fabled City of Qeynos, 
            and to places small and quaint like Rivervale, the city of halflings. 
            Even to some dark and dangerous places like the undead area of Befallen 
            and the depths of Nektulos Forest. The place that changed him most 
            though was the Oasis of Marr, for that is where he met Drakken Soulblighter.</p>
          <p align=left>At first he was 
            taken back by the large ugly troll, wondering if he should rid the 
            land of the foul beast. Then he noticed the others around the troll 
            were not attacking, yet conversing with the huge monster. Alendar 
            approached and asked to join their group, the troll beamed a toothy 
            smile and extended a hand of friendship. Alendar took the offered 
            hand, albeit tentatively at first, and began his adventures with Drakken. 
            While they rested, Drakken told Alendar of the Shadow Gypsies and 
            their search for "the Way", and it was as if a light came on in front 
            of him. Alendar realized this too must be what he had been searching 
            for all this time. Alendar jumped up and ran over to the troll, pressing 
            him for more information, what when where how? Drakken just chuckled 
            and waited patiently for the questions to die down. He told the disappointed 
            Alendar, that they were still searching for "the Way" and that soon, 
            hopefully, all would be revealed to them. Alendar asked to join Drakken 
            and his motley assortment of friends in their search, and was overjoyed 
            when he was accepted into the Gypsies. Since then Alendar has seen 
            much and enjoyed many adventures with his new found family. Though 
            at first he was a bit shocked at how one of his own could marry and 
            love a Dark Elf. He soon began to realize that it was not a bad thing, 
            as a young Dark Elf wizard had found a place in his heart, whether 
            or not she knows it or cares is a different story, one he hopes may 
            have a happy ending...</p>
