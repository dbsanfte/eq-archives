          <P align=left style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Verdana">With a roar, Drakken's Halberd skewered the orc warrior, 
            slicing through bone and sinew as red foam formed at the warrior's 
            mouth, signaling lung damage. With a small grunt, Drakken placed his 
            foot on the dead warrior's chest, and pulled on his halberd free as 
            a powerful explosion threatened to knock him off his feet.</font> </P>
          <P align=left style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0">&nbsp;</P>
          <P align=left style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Verdana">He let out a low growl, ignoring the pain as he looked 
            around for the magic caster that had sent him such an annoying shock. 
            The orc cleric's eyes widened as Drakken caught site of him, giving 
            him an evil, hungry grin.</font></P>
          <P align=left style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Verdana">"Stupid
          orcs...&quot; he mumbled as he lumbered towards the 
            cleric.</font> </P>
          <P align=left style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0">&nbsp; </P>
          <P align=left style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Verdana">With a yelp, the cleric turned to run, and suddenly felt 
            strength leave him, making him unable to run very quickly.</font> </P>
          <P align=left style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Ahh...I feel much better." Drakken said, with a satisfied 
            smile. It was then that a feeling of dread crept over the doomed orc.</font> 
          </P>
          <P align=left style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0">&nbsp; </P>
          <P align=left style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Verdana">Turning, the Cleric swung blindly, hitting Drakken with 
            a solid blow that only seemed to enrage him as he clubbed the cleric 
            with a fist of his own, knocking him sprawling, and stunning him, 
            only to be followed by death itself, as the cleric saw Drakken raise 
            his halberd with both hands, and pure rage on his face...then everything 
            went black....</font> </P>
          <P align=left style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Verdana">Drakken grunted slightly as he bent down to search the 
            corpses of the two orcs, and grumbled darkly at only finding a few 
            silver pieces and a useless rusty weapon.</font> </P>
          <P align=left style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0">&nbsp; </P>
          <P align=left style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Verdana">"Stupid land...why the gods brought me here....first Meridian 
            dies...and now..?" Drakken grumbled as he walked towards the nearby 
            dervish camps.</font> </P>
          <P align=left style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0">&nbsp; </P>
          <P align=left style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Verdana">"Lost "The Way"....lost my master...lost friends...all 
            gone" Drakken muttered as he spied a lone Dervish. The dervish eyed 
            the muttering, and obviously angry troll as he approached.</font> </P>
          <P align=left style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0">&nbsp; </P>
          <P align=left style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Verdana">"Stuck in this damn, lumbering body...can't travel anywhere...." 
            Drakken muttered as he struck the dervish, releasing his anger once 
            again.</font> </P>
          <P align=left style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0">&nbsp; </P>
          <P align=left style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Verdana">"I'll teach you to mess with me!" the dervish shouted, 
            as he danced back. Drakken's face just grew darker still, anger and 
            frustration masking his face into one of near hatred for anything 
            living.</font> </P>
          <P align=left style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0">&nbsp; </P>
          <P align=left style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Shuttup!&quot; Drakken roared, as his halberd split the cutthroat's 
            skull in two, making a wet 'cracking' sound. The Cutthroat fell without 
            a sound, and Drakken simply moved on, after looting what he could 
            from the hapeless victim's corpse.</font> </P>
          <P align=left style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Verdana">"I hate the gods! Always toying with our lives...and now 
            they have done...THIS to me!" Drakken said, as he approached a camp 
            he had spied in the distance.</font> </P>
          <P align=left style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0">&nbsp; </P>
          <P align=left style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Verdana">"I'm just...so damn UGLY...and my thoughts are...like 
            I cant think as clearly as I used to!" he shouted to no one in particular 
            as he rushed the camp of yet more cutthroats, releasing a battle cry 
            that seemed to shake the very earth.</font> </P>
          <P align=left style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Verdana">"I MUST find "The Way!" There MUST be a way to regain 
            that which I have lost!" Drakken shouted as he beheaded a cutthroat 
            wizard with one swipe of his halberd, and then proceeded to bite the 
            throat of another, tearing it out and spitting it on the ground.</font> </P>
          <P align=left style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0">&nbsp; </P>
          <P align=left style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font color="#808080" size="2" face="Verdana">"Until then...you ALL DIE!" Drakken yelled, as he dismembered 
            the third cutthroat, then leaving the camp as suddenly as he came, 
            wandering the desert of Ro aimlessly, in a fit of rage...</font> </P>
