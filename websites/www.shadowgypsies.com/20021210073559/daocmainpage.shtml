<br><br><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">======================================= <br>Dark Age of Camelot <br>Camelot 1.56 Release Notes<br>Tuesday, December 3, 2002 <br>======================================= <br><br>ENTER: SHROUDED ISLES <br><br>With 1.56 comes the launching of Dark Age of Camelot: Shrouded Isles, the first expansion pack for the game. Shrouded Isles is a major upgrade for players of Camelot - it has an all-new graphics engine, an ambient music soundtrack, revamped interfaces, new lands to explore, six new classes, and three new races. With Shrouded Isles, you'll be able to find new weapons and armor, experience a newer, deadlier, monster AI, and loads of new content. As of today, if you have purchased the SI box, you'll now be able to explore the new continents and play the six new classes. For information on the new continents, races, and classes, please visit the Shrouded Isles web site at www.shroudedisles.com. <br><br>A NOTE ON CLASS CHANGES <br><br>1.56 has a lot of class tweaks and balance changes, and new stuff to test. Hunters and Warriors get boosted in melee power. Healing-types now get RP for resurrecting their friends, and we've changed resurrection spells around a bit to support that. There is a new type of healing spells for each Realm's primary healers that will make keeping people alive in RvR much easier. We have also taken steps to address the problems of Assassins being able to fight in melee combat better than we intended. Read through these notes closely.<br><br><br>HUNTER CHANGES <br><br>We've decided to make Hunters more effective in Melee combat. These changes will help them greatly in both PvE as well as RvR: <br><br>- All Hunter melee skills base damages have been increased "behind the scenes". The specific melee skills involved are sword and spear. Hunters will now notice that they do more damage every time they attack an opponent with these weapon types. Hunters now do more base damage than the other two Archer classes, and will not need to do anything to take advantage of this change - it will happen automatically every time they hit with a weapon. <br>- Hunters have been given a new line of spells in their Beastcraft specialization that allows them to insta-cast a wolf pet. This can be done at any time, even in combat. These are shouts that cost 25% power and have a 2 minute recast time. Please note that if a Hunter is controlling a charmed pet, they cannot summon a wolf pet. Here's the list: <br><br>1 Hunter's Companion 80% <br>7 Hunter's Pet 80% <br>13 Hunter's Ally 80% <br>20 Hunter's Protector 80% <br>32 Hunter's Avatar 82% <br><br>WARRIOR CHANGE <br><br>In order to make the Warrior more of a melee damage-dealer, we've increased his weapon skills (again, behind the scenes, as with the Hunter) so that he will do more damage every time he hits with an Axe, Hammer, or Sword (both 1 and 2h). With this change, the Warrior now does more base damage than any other class in the game. Warriors don't need to do anything to take advantage of this change - it will happen automatically every time they hit with a weapon. <br><br>ASSASSIN CLASS CHANGES <br><br>Because of the great advantages Assassin classes - Nightshades, Shadowblades, and Infiltrators - now have over almost any other class in the game (poisons, stealth, devastating combat styles, good base damage, extremely high evade, etc.), we've decided to take some steps to bring them back in line with the rest of the classes in the game. We realize that these three classes are not exactly the same, but they all have a combination of abilities that make them more powerful than other classes of their level. The overall design goal of the assassin is to have them be able to defeat opponents using a combination of stealth and their "backstab" combat style chains. Now, with these changes, they'll have to use more strategy to defeat their target opponents. There's no way to sugar coat this - these steps will make Assassins less effective in direct combat. <br>- We've removed the Ignore Pain Realm Ability from all three Assassin classes. These classes have been granted back the realm training points they spent to get Ignore Pain. It was an oversight that Assassins were given IP at all, and we should have taken it away sooner. <br>- We are capping the maximum amount that any player (of any class) can evade at 50%. Assassins are the only classes that can currently go above this cap, by linking together their Evade 7 ability, plus the Realm Ability Dodger, plus stat bonuses. Assassins will be granted a Realm Ability respec for those who no longer want Dodger ability (as it is usually Dodger that pushes them above 50%). Please note that you will get the realm ability respec only if you currently have Dodger and you are a Nightshade, a Shadowblade, or an Infiltrator. <br>SPREAD HEAL SPELLS AND BATTERY HEAL REALM ABILITY <br><br>The three base healing classes (Clerics, Healers, Druids) now have a new type of healing spell that will help them in heavy battle - particularly RvR - situations. This spell type is called a "Spread Heal". These spells need no target - they search through the group applying healing power to whoever is lowest in health (As a percentage of their max, not as a straight value) until the group is full or the pool has been used. These spells should be especially useful in RvR encounters where targeting is a problem and many people can be taking damage at the same time. In normal PvE encounters or where one target specifically is taking the most damage, directed heals remain the most efficient and effective option. When everyone in the group is low, standard group heals remain the best option. Spreadheals fall somewhere in between - when some members of the group are still full or near full, and some members are falling fast, these heals will be the most efficient option. <br><br>Cleric Rejuvenation spec <br>30 Gift of the Host <br>39 Boon of the Host <br>48 Blessing of the Host <br><br>Healer Mend spec <br>30 Ancestor's Gift <br>39 Ancestor's Favor <br>48 Ancestor's Boon <br><br>Druid Regrowth spec <br>30 Regenerating Spirits <br>39 Resuscitating Spirits <br>48 Reviving Spirits <br><br>Battery of Life Realm Ability <br><br>Also, a new realm ability is now available to the primary healers in each realm at a 10 realm point cost, called Battery of Life, which is a different variety of spreadheal. It allows the user to create a spreadheal pool that essentially remains on him as a battery; checking every round to see if anyone needs healing and applying it when needed just like a spreadheal. If the entire battery is not used, the remaining amount remains on the caster waiting to be used. This ability should also be particularly useful in RvR - it can grant the healer the initiative to heal before everyone in his group starts taking damage. As soon as the group begins taking damage they're already being healed by the battery, and the healer can begin casting another spell which will hopefully be cast before the battery runs out. The battery and the spreadheal used together should go a long way towards allowing healers in RvR to do what they're intended to do - keep the group alive as long as they have the power left to do so. One important difference to note about the battery from spreadheal - it does not flow into the caster, only their group mates. This is not intended to be an automatic complete heal for the healer. <br><br>RESURRECTION SPELL CHANGES <br><br>Due to the recent change where you now receive Realm Points for resurrecting your realm-mates in RvR battles, we've had to change some of the resurrection spells. Here's the list: <br><br>- All resurrection spells now have a 4 second cast time. <br>- The power costs for all resurrection spells have not been changed. <br>- When casting a resurrection spell, you receive a message and the spell cancels if the target is already considering a resurrection from someone else. <br>- Resurrection sickness now goes from 100% to 50% when doing a "full rez" on another player. <br>- Low level resurrection spells now give 5% RP's to the caster and high level rezzes do up to 15% of the RP's to the caster. Mid level ones are between the two. <br><br>RESPEC NOTES<br><br>With the class changes that come with 1.56, we're giving the following respec options to the various classes affected by the changes:<br><br>- all primary healing classes over level 30 get a single-line respec (because of spread heal).<br>- all primary healing classes get a realm ability respec (because of heal battery). <br>- Hunters get a full respec (because of new wolf pets and melee combat changes). <br>- all Assassin classes automatically get the points back they initially spent for Ignore Pain, and IP is stripped from their character, if they had IP to begin with. <br>- all Assassin classes get a realm ability respec if they have Dodger, Ignore Pain, or First Aid. <br><br>Please note that if you meet these criteria, but you already have a respec of the type listed here, you will not get an additional one - for example, if you are an Infiltrator with a Realm Respec that you haven't used, you won't get another one. But, if you are an Infiltrator who does not have a Realm Ability respec, you will be given one. <br><br>INTERFACE NOTES <br><br>- There is a new window - the Command Window - which has two rows of buttons of commonly-used Camelot commands. You'll find things like "attack", "sit", "relic status" and so forth on this window. You can Shift-Left-Click buttons on the Command Window to make quickbar buttons out of them. <br><br>- There is a new "Options" window (displayed by clicking "options" from the character stat/information window). This dialog lets you specify in-game settings like sound/music/ambience/ambient music volumes, and name-color scheme. The Shrouded Isles client has many more options as well. <br>- The mini-info window (comes up when you right click on an item) is now a separate window and doesn't share a window with your target/health window. <br>- There are no longer "white" con color items when you are crafting. When a crafting recipe was on a skill boundary (about to change from red to orange con), it would turn white for one skill point. <br>- When you use a performance configuration slash command or popup command from in game, the changes are saved and should reflect in the main configuration window. <br>- The compass is now on by default for new players <br><br>NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES <br><br>- We now support eight characters per realm per server. <br>- Healing-type classes will now receive Realm Points for resurrecting a friendly player. Please note that you will not get Realm Points for resurrecting someone if they did not "give" Realm Points when they were killed. Also please note that the number of RPs you can get from one resurrection is capped at 2x the RPs that you yourself are worth. <br>- Characters in the main menu will now perform an emote after being selected. <br>- Dying a standard PvE or Suicide fall death should no longer allow you to use the corpse summoner. PvP deaths are not affected by this change. <br>- Corpse summoners can no longer summon corpses while in combat. <br>- Any summoned pet to a ground target should now obey visibility (turrets for animists). <br>- You should no longer see your circular shadow below you when swimming in classic shadows. Likewise, you should no longer see your high definition shadow below you for new shadows when swimming. <br>- Fixed a bug where brush was sorted incorrectly versus rivers in the classic client. <br>- Shadows for large monsters on hills should no longer be clipped oddly in terrain zones from certain angles. <br>- You can no longer load the Expansion zones while running the Classic client. Previously, you could run the expansion client, teleport to an expansion zone, then run the classic client and try to enter with that same character, resulting in either a client crash or you'd end up in an empty zone. Now if you try to enter a SI zone with the classic client, you'll get an error message, and it won't let you load. <br>- The zone loading bar has been moved to not interfere with pretty loading screens. <br><br>NEW EMOTES <br><br>There are five new emotes: <br>- "/ponder" - for when you just want to go "hmmmmmm". <br>- "/military" - a military salute. <br>- "/present" - to present someone with something. <br>- "/taunt" - a very naughty gesture when you really want to insult someone. <br>- "/rude" - a rude gesture. <br><br>SOUND AND MUSIC NOTES <br><br>The new sound options allow independent volume setting for each of the following: <br><br>- Sound Effects: gameplay sounds (combat sounds, spells, etc.) <br>- Music: basically, the MP3s (play when you enter the game, towns, combat music, etc.) <br>- Ambient Sound Effects: random non-music sounds (birds, wind, etc.) <br>- Ambient Music: self-explanatory<br><br>You should be able to set these options in the old Character Select options menu and in the new in-game options menu. Possible settings are: "Off", 1-9 (increasing volume) & "Full" (full volume). <br><br>Sound setting changes made in either the Character Select options menu or the in-game options menu should persist between play sessions. <br><br>Additional Notes: <br>In the Main Menu of the game, you can change the sound settings (via the Options button) but they won't take effect until you enter the game or exit and come back in. However, if you change the settings in the in-game options menu, the volume should change in real time giving an audible cue to the current sound level (if sounds or music is playing at the time). <br><br>In the original "classic" Camelot, you only have 2 sound options: Sound Effects and Music. In this case, the Ambient Effects use the Sound Effects volume value while music uses the Music volume value. <br><br>SPELL NOTES <br><br>- Dexterity buffs now affect casting speed on monsters. <br><br>WORLD NOTES <br><br>The following monsters have had their models changed: <br>- Weakened Demon <br>- red rager <br>- Vrede <br>- flame thrower <br>- Bright Flame <br>- fire phantom <br>- Spirit of Flames <br>- flame spout <br>- Dungeon: Darkness Falls: Marbo, the Sapphire Seal Merchant, will now sell a Corrupted Dismal Vest for Berserkers. <br>- All three dragon lairs have been extended in area (to allow better raid co-ordination) <br>Albion: A new horse route has been added from Snowdonia Station to Llyn Barfog. <br>Hibernia: A new horse route has been added from Brynach to Cursed Forest. <br>Midgard: A new horse route has been added from Gna Faste to West Skona. <br>Midgard: A new horse route has been added from West Skona to Gna Faste. <br>Realm v. Realm - Frontier Keeps: Corpse Summoners will no longer appear at Bledmeer Faste, Dun Crauchon and Caer Benowyc. <br><br>Treasure, General <br><br>- The Radiant Moonclipper (Albion) now salvages for the appropriate amount.<br><br>PvP SERVER WORLD NOTES <br><br>- We've added three medallions of passage to all city medallion merchants. These medallions will port you to the expansion starting zones and will only work if you have purchased the expansion. New Port Destinations: Gothwaite Harbor, Aegirhamn, Grove of Domnann <br><br>TRADESKILL NOTES <br><br>- Fixed the Skill value that the newer Albion Spellcraft gems were set to be more appropriate for what they are <br>- Split the new Albion weapons out to separate lists appropriately <br>- Changed the name of the wizened wood to wisened wood <br>-Added Soul Rending spec and focus gems to Albion Spellcraft: Steaming Fervor Sigil and Steaming Sigil <br>- Removed the Soulrending Focus gem from Albion spellcraft <br>- Fixed new weapon components only using 10th rank materials for Albion and Midgard <br>- Fixed recipes where a "null" object was created in Albion <br>- Fixed all of the icons for the newer weapons to use the appropriate icon for said weapons (i.e. flexible, hand to hand, and scythes) <br>- Fixed weapons that are leather, instead of metal, to have their DPS progress normally <br>- Fixed issue with Midgard Alchemy, Herbcraft, etc, not showing up properly <br><br></font></td></tr></table>

<br><br><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">======================================= <br>Dark Age of Camelot <br>Camelot 1.55 Test Release Notes <br>Monday, November 25, 2002 <br>======================================= <br><br>THE LURIKEEN UPRISING HAS PREVAILED <br><br>- As of this patch, Lurikeen can become Heroes. Thanks for the great roleplaying moments to everyone involved in the Uprising. Enjoy! <br><br>NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES <br><br>- We have made it so you can no longer duel in cities. Peace has once again been restored to crafters. <br>- Fixes a problem where archers would play one frame of a combat swing animation after killing an opponent with a bow. This was a client animation problem only - it didn't actually affect bow shot times, and it appeared randomly. <br>- Couriers should now honor all pathing geometries and should obey zone wall boundaries. <br>- Realm guards should now follow leaders and maintain speed with leader. This should also fix the aggro problem when realm guards would lag behind and not aggro on enemies. <br>- We have implemented a /GROUNDASSIST command on the server. By using this command, your own groundtarget assumes the same location as your targeted player's ground target. This allows for a "front spotter" who is possibly stealthed to set a ground target for a siege equipment controller or spellcaster. <br>- We fixed the delving of combat spell abilities - these were printing incorrectly. <br>- When you upgrade an outpost you are setting a desired level on the outpost. The level will only increase or decrease one notch per 6 minutes. <br>- Performing a successful Guard or Intercept no longer causes an interrupt to a caster who is guarded. <br>- Level 51 cloth armor should now get the correct amount of bonus levels. <br>- Legendary crafting titles should now set and display correctly. <br>- Bards can now hold and use staves (although they cannot train in them). This is a longstanding bug. All classes should be able to hold and use staves. <br>- You can no longer put proc effects on jewelry, cloaks or instruments to artificially boost their level. <br>- Monsters will no longer attempt to cast a 20th concentration effect repeatedly. <br>- The Realm Abilities First Aid and Mystic Crystal Lore can no longer be used in combat. Using them in combat was a bug, and it is now fixed. <br><br>HELM PROBLEMS <br><br>We are halfway through transitioning to a new, better system of displaying helms. This system will allow us to create new helmet graphics much faster, and allow them to fit player models much more effectively. Please be aware that there may be some display issues with some helmet/race combinations until we fully migrate to the new helm system. <br><br>REALM POINTS FOR RESURRECTING NOTE <br><br>Please note that on Pendragon, we've been testing a system that gives classes that can resurrect their fallen comrades Realm Points for doing so. For now, we're holding off rolling this system live until we've worked all the kinks out of the system, based on the concerns of the Pendragon community and the team leads. So, none of the Pendragon resurrection-specific spell changes that you may have read about in the various 1.55 test release notes have been implemented in this live version, which includes getting Realm Points for rezzing, decreased casting times for higher-level rezzes, etc. <br><br>RVR CHANGES <br><br>- We have made it so you can gain experience points for engaging in RvR and killing, or helping to kill, enemies. You will not lose experience when you die, but when you kill an enemy, you will now be awarded "normal" (i.e. as if the enemy was a monster, based on level) experience for the kill. Thus if the player is blue to you, you will be given normal "blue" monster experience for the kill. Please note that there is a known bug currently in this system where under some circumstances if you are grouped you won't get experience for a group-member's kill. We are looking at this problem right now and will fix it as soon as we can. <br><br>SPELL NOTES <br><br>In advance of Shrouded Isles, we have taken steps to correct a longstanding spell issue. Several spells allow casters to buff lower-level characters without adhering to a cap of any type, thus enabling lower-level characters to be able to fight monsters far above their level, with almost no danger. This allows low-level characters to level far faster than intended. We want these spells to help low level characters, but not without a cap of some type. <br><br>So, these Damage Add and Damage Shield spells are now capped, so they will no longer give 50th level damage-per-second to a 1st level character. However, given that some players are used to being able to do this, we have made the cap higher than it normally would be - you'll still be able to help out lower level characters with these spells, but not to the extremes that existed up until now. <br><br>Please note that we have implemented this on a sliding scale as per the rest of the buffs in the game. If you are a mage that has these spells, the lower level you are, the less this change will impact you. The most impact will be from an extremely high mage (i.e. 40+) buffing a 1st or 2nd level character. The damage allowed slides up from there. <br><br>SIEGE WARFARE NOTES <br><br>Siege damage has been flattened across the entire area affected. In other words, there is no drop off from a direct hit and someone at the edge of the bolt. <br><br>Additional types of catapult ammunition have been added to the ammunition stores. Note that the cost of existing ammunition has been raised, to be more in line with the new ammunition: <br><br>- A catapult bullet - which is a higher damage, low area shot. <br>- Grapeshot - which is a lower damage, high area shot. <br>- A ball of ice - which is similar to the existing catapult stone, but does cold damage. <br><br>The "power level" of all siege ammunition has been increased. This should lead to higher, more consistent damage when using these weapons. <br><br><br><br>WORLD NOTES <br><br>- Many of the Midgard NPC's have removed the robes favored in enemy lands, and replaced them with appropriate Midgard vests. <br>- Dungeon: Summoner Hall: Grand Summoner Govannon should no longer be able to heal himself multiple times in the course of combat. <br>- Darkness Falls: Beliathan can no longer be fought in the tunnels of Darkness falls, however, he will now linger longer in the room when he spawns. <br>- Hibernia: Touched now correctly resembles the diseased Celt that he is. <br>- Albion: We have added a bindstone near Swanton Keep in North Black Mountains. The Snowdonia Relic keep (Albion Power) was the relic keep that was the farthest from any bindstone. This bindstone should provide a binding location for Albion players who wish to defend this relic. <br><br><br>Realm v. Realm - Frontier Keeps <br><br>Keep Lords - At low health, the Keep lords will now summon help from the courtyard and the new "personal guard" spawned at keep upgrade level 8. Given their newfound confidence in their allies, keep lords will no longer use their anti-bladeturn abilities. <br><br>- When a keep is upgraded to level 8 - 4 additional Keep Guards will spawn near the lord room. <br>- If you take over an enemy's keep and that realm has at least one of your relics, if you upgrade the keep to level 10 it will spawn a corpse summoner NPC. If you die in PvP and type /transfercorpse "keep name" without the quotes your corpse will transfer to that keep, although you will still need to be resurrected once you get there. Note that enemy players can kill this NPC and if they do so, the /transfercorpse command will be unavailable to you for that keep until he respawns (in one hour). <br><br>TRADESKILL NOTES <br><br>- Fixed the higher material Wrought Jewelry Boxes so they are able to be made correctly now in Albion. <br>- Fixed the stable leeching tincture recipe so that it creates the leeching tincture and not the ablative tincture. <br>- In Albion labeled the stable leeching tincture recipe correctly. <br><br><br></font></td></tr></table>
