          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;No!&quot; Drakken 
            roared, his fist hammering his desktop, splitting it down the center, 
            causing Shanna to slightly jump, and kkal to snort derisively. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;You!&quot; Drakken 
            yelled, his face mottled with rage. &quot;Go get that book, and don't 
            come back until you have it!&quot; Kkal nodded, then muttered some 
            words, stepped into the shadows, and disappeared.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;You should send 
            someone with him, Drakk&quot; Shanna adviced. Drakken turned on Shanna.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I know what I 
            am doing this time, don't second guess me!&quot; He said, as he sheathed 
            his blackened sword and stormed out of his office, heading for the 
            nearest bar to wash tonight's happenings in a flood of cheap ale.</font></p>
            <h3><font color="#FF0000">Dark Omens</font></h3>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">Kkal followed the trail 
            of the thieves, not liking the direction the were headed. He had spent 
            a half day persueing his prey, yet with every passing footstep, he 
            knew with a dread certainty that they were traveling to the gate of 
            fear itself...the plane of fear.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">As night invaded in 
            all its strength, causing the Feerrott to become even darker, Kkal 
            hastened his pace, attempting to catch his quarry before they reached 
            the gate...they were close, he knew. He smelled them. Then, passing 
            to the right of a rather large tree, he froze a moment when he caught 
            sight of them. One was clearly a necromancer, judging by his garb, 
            while the other was...he couldn't tell. He...or it...was shrouded 
            in a robe, and had its hood over his head, but there was some...power 
            emenating from it that made Kkal uncomfotable, which was multiplied 
            by the fact that they did not seem to be in a hurry...a trait not 
            normal of a thief attempting to make a grand escape. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">Kkal took a deep breath, 
            centering himself as he drew is sword, his large frame barreling towards 
            the prey. He quickly decided that the necromancer had to die first, 
            which in turn would cause his pet to fall lifeless to the ground.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">With a war cry that 
            seemed to shake the very heavens, Kkal decended upon the unsuspecting 
            couple, his invisibility wearing off due to lack of concentration. 
            The necromancer's skeleton attacked, cackeling while its sword bounced 
            harmlessly off Kka's armor, while Kkal's own blade sought out the 
            necromancer, who had lept back while trying to stammer out a spell.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">Kkal's blood boiled, 
            and his vision was tinted with red as the necromancer's spell took 
            hold, while kkal recovered from his previous blow by reversing his 
            stroke, deftly impaling the dark elf. Kkal grinned evilly as the pet 
            fell as if its strings were cut, then his vision blurred as he was 
            thrown through the air as from a unseen blow, landing him gasping 
            for breath, on his back.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2"><i>'The other thief!' 
            </i>Kkal thought, as he raised to his feet, and looked about him. 
            Kkal's eyes went wide in horror as he recognized what only could be 
            merely an avatar of his god, Cazic himself. Yet, this avatar was taller, 
            stronger than the others he had seen, and under one of his four arms 
            was the book, nestled comfortably.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">The avatar's arms lashed 
            towards Kkal, striking with blinding speed, as Kkal lept back. The 
            avatar's fist connected with Kkal's jaw, throwing his head back, and 
            causing his blood to spray as Kkal staggered back losing his grip 
            on his sword.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;You fool! You 
            dare betray your god?&quot; said a voice, seemingly unconnected to 
            the avatar. &quot;Leave now, or die!&quot; the voice commanded. One 
            of its hands made a curious gesture, towards Kkal, and instantly a 
            fear gripped him...yet he was familiar with that fear, for he felt 
            it often, while praying in the temple of Cazic himself.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">The other ogres and 
            trolls hunting in the area had long since left. Running away in a 
            pure panic at the scene being played out before them.</font> <font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">Kkal 
            stood, tall and proud, his head erect and eyes glinting brightly. 
            All his life, he knew this moment would come. With a roar that shook 
            the very trees and earth of Feerrott shook as Kkal leapt toward the 
            avatar. A great flame thundered as kkal unleashed a touch of harm 
            upon the avatar. Flinching, the avatar covered his eyes, and Kkal 
            tore the book away from the avatar, then focusing his eyes on the 
            book, cast a spell which he knew was prohibited for him to know, causing 
            the book to vanish.</font></p>
            <h3><font color="#FF0000">Foreboding</font></h3>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">Drakken slouched over 
            his ale, sulking over his ill luck, when the book appeared in a bright 
            flash of light, on the counter next to him, startling him.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;What da..!&quot; 
            Drakken's face paled, and a look of fear briefly touched his visage.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Shanna!&quot; 
            Drakken roared, grabbing the book , and running as fast as his legs 
            could carry him towards his office.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;SHANNA!&quot; 
            Drakken roared louder still, causing his voice to echo off the rocky 
            faces of Grobb. Shanna poked her head out of the general store.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Get a druid here 
            now! Kkal is in trouble!&quot; Shanna's indigo face paled as she froze 
            a moment, then her training took over, and she vanished in a flash 
            of white light. Drakken threw open the door to his office, and frantically 
            began to arm himself.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Cierah!&quot; 
            Drakken yelled.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Yes?&quot;Cierah 
            walked in from the back room, where she had been studying, dressed 
            comfortably in a silk gown.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Get your medicine 
            bag and gear, Kkal is in trouble.&quot; Cierah nodded, quickly slipping 
            out the door towards her room where she stayed while in Grobb. A short 
            time later, Shanna appeared, along with Kleintje, and Cierah arrived 
            scant moments later.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Take us to Feerrott, 
            Klein.&quot; Drakk said, pulling his blackened sword.</font></p>
            <h3><font color="#FF0000">Receding Shadows...</font></h3>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;You imbecelle!&quot; 
            The avatar roared, having recovered from his surprise. Kkal turned 
            on the Avatar with renewed fury, his large fist connecting solidly 
            with the avatar, who howled in surprise as he staggered backward. 
            There was a brief flash of bright light then, and as Kkal's vision 
            cleared, he saw that black weapons were held in each of the avatar's 
            four arms. Suddenly aware of the gravity of the situation, Kkal's 
            eyes darted from side to side, searching for his dropped sword, only 
            to find it slightly behind the now armed avatar.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;You fool. You 
            die now!&quot; the Avatar roared.</font> <font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">Kkal 
            dove towards his sword as the avatar leapt towards him with stunning 
            speed, one weapon slicing Kkal deep into his chest. With a roar of 
            pain, Kkal landed hard, his hand clasping the hilt of his sword, yet 
            he could not find the strength to raise it. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">As the Avatar pulled 
            the sword out of Kkal's chest, and brought up a sword for the killing 
            blow, Kkal saw Drakken appear seemingly out of nowhere, roaring obscenities, 
            crashing into the Avatar, causing both to go down in a heap.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">The Avatar was first 
            on his feet, screeching in hatred as he flew towards Drakken, who 
            was still trying to regain his feet, and then Shanna was there, fire 
            enveloping her in an aura of pure power. Her eye's seemed to glow 
            as she threw a bolt of pure fire into the Avatar's face, causing him 
            to drop one of his swords while he attempted to cover his face.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">The Avatar muttered 
            a quick spell, sending a bolt of his own streaking towards shanna, 
            as she attempted to counter...then Cierah was there, grasping her 
            mace in both hands as she brought it down squarely on the avatar's 
            head, causing greenish blood to fly.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;You will all 
            die!&quot; the Avatar screamed, as he leapt away from cierah, and 
            started running towards the gate to the plane of fear, only to be 
            chased by a swift running Kleintje, his feet quickened by the spirit 
            of the cheetah.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Cierah, see to 
            kkal.&quot; Drakken ordered, as he ran after Klein, and the departing 
            Avatar. Cierah nodded, and went to work, chanting a quick spell as 
            both she and kkal were enveloped in a blue aura, while Shanna stood 
            guard.</font></p>
            <h3><font color="#FF0000">The Door Of Death</font></h3>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">Cierah's eyes opened, 
            and she let a soft sigh escape her lips as she turned towards the 
            awaiting Drakken, who had long since chased everyone out of Kkal's 
            room, so that she could work. Kkal lay on his bead, his breathing 
            shallow.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I've done all 
            I can.&quot; Cierah said. Her face was drawn, and there were dark 
            circles under her eyes. &quot;I...that weapon was not normal.&quot; 
            </font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">Drakken rested a hand 
            on Cierah's shoulder and said,&quot;You've done your best, that is 
            all I ask, Cier. Go get some rest.&quot; Nodding gratefully, Cierah 
            quietly left.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">Drakken sighed and 
            lowered himself into a nearby chair, staring at his long time friend. 
            They had been through so much together...they had travelled worlds 
            together...and now, some strange...freak threatened to take it all 
            away.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Don't die on 
            me now, you young whipper-snapper.&quot; Drakken said, his voice gruff. 
            &quot;It all my fault. I should have never sent you.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;You know that's 
            not true, Drakk.&quot; Drakk's eyes widened as he caught site of a 
            ghostly form near the doorway. &quot;It's not your fault. He knew 
            what being a Shadow Gypsie required.&quot; </font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;But I should 
            have sent Shanna with him, Master.&quot; said Drakken. The ghostly 
            form of his teacher sighed, and shook his head.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Perhaps, but 
            you didn't.&quot; Lan answered. Drakken's face lowered in shame.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;That's right, 
            I didn't. I was so arrogant, I did not heed Shanna's warning.&quot; 
            Drakken answered.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Listen, Drakken.&quot; 
            Lan said. &quot;You can sit here, and regret your decisions, or you 
            can learn from them, but while you yet sit here and sulk, &quot;The 
            Way&quot; is becoming ever more distant to you, and those new &quot;Lost 
            Souls&quot; who are now with us. You are the only one who can do this, 
            and it is time. Gather your precious few, and prepare them. Your journey 
            is near.&quot; Lan's form faded from view, leaving Drakken to think 
            in the dark...</font></p>
