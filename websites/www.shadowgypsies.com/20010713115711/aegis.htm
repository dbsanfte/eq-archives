<p style="line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Finally,
after all your searching, THE definitive manner in which to camp Lord Grimrot
for the Aegis of Life. I've read all the guides, scanned all the reviews, and
copied down a lot of your great ideas. This is not a guide to put anyone's ideas
down. Here I dispel myths and quell rumours TO AVOID YOU WASTING YOUR OWN TIME.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I just
parked myself down in South Karana and got ready to wait. I play Rallos and
couldn't afford NOT to get this item, and since there were so many contradictory
theories about how to make him spawn/what times to kill the PHs/etc etc, I
started from scratch. I knew that I would get him to spawn eventually, either by
luck or by tact, but I wanted to make it easier either to do it again (Heaven
forbid) or for everyone else who decided it was time to get this great item.</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><u>WANDERING
MOBS</u></b></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">None of
the mobs relevant to this camp wander at all. None of them. This information is
only to quell any fears you may have from additional mobs interfering with spawn
rates, PHs, etc. There are a number of wandering mobs around the Undead Camp
where you will be doing your camp. From the Undead Cyclops (Paladin Quest) to
the wandering Spirocs and the occasional lion/lioness, as far as I can tell they
have no effect on the spawn or the camp. If they get close enough to the camp,
wandering Treants will attack Putrid Skeletons, but wandering Elephants should
not pose a problem either. Cyclops that frequent the area are a nuisance but can
be avoided if you stay on the perimeter of the camp. From what I can tell, none
of these mobs dying/wandering through the camp/etc. have any bearing on the
timing or frequency of the Grimrot spawn. They seem to be independent of the
pop, and despite rumours of an &quot;SK Cycle&quot; like the popularized
&quot;FM Cycle&quot;, there is no evidence to support this and I can only assume
that it is not true.</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><b><u><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE
PLACEHOLDER</font></u></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin: 0" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
Placeholder (PH) for both of Lord Grimrot's spawn versions (skeletal and human)
appears in the form of a Putrid Skeleton. The PH spawns directly underneath one of
the upright huts that <i> does not have a lantern on it</i>. There are several huts
without lanterns on them, but this one is almost right in the center of the
camp. The real PH can be easily confused with another Putrid Skeleton that
spawns and collapses right against one of the legs of this hut. <u> Do not be
fooled, the real PH is a Putrid Skeleton that does not fall</u>.
Also, the real PH always wields a rusty Broadsword, and when you attack it,
instead of threatening you with some obscure Norrathian villain, the Putrid
Skeleton simply says, &quot;Die like the fool you are&quot; when attacked. You
get all the same faction from killing this Putrid Skeleton that you do the other
similar mobs that spawn in the Undead Camp. Remember, there are eight or 10 Putrid
Skeletons that spawn in the camp, but ONLY the one that STANDS DIRECTLY UNDER
the center hut is the true PH.</font></p>

CLEARING?</u></b></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">My first
attempts at this camp were to clear the camp of ALL Skeletons and Putrid
Skeletons. This, I thought, would help force the PH to spawn at the appropriate
time. However, this is not necessary. The first time I allowed the entire camp
to stay spawned, I was quite pleased to see the PH pop right on time. No
clearing was necessary (though still recommended for faction) so it is NOT a
necessity to clear camp to make Grimrot spawn. This changes the quest little,
but now you can take comfort in knowing that if you are unable to keep the
entire camp cleaned (from medding/healing etc) it is not a problem, don't worry
about it.</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><u>TIMING
IT</u></b></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">To finish
my quest I had to endure seven (14) cycles of this PH. In that time I have
narrowed the spawn time on the PH from 3hr10m --&gt; 3hr25m. The average spawn
time was 3h14m. The PH never spawns faster than 3h10m, and never takes longer
than 3hr25m. That is fact.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This timer
starts the second you KILL THE PH. Not as soon as it spawns, but as soon as you
kill it. Once it's down, it doesn't seem to matter whether or not you even loot
the corpse. The next PH (or Grimrot) will spawn ~3h14m after the PH dies. Since
we discussed already &quot;clearing the camp&quot;, you know that it doesn't
matter whether or not the camp is clear and it seems the timer on the PH is
completely independent of the camp being cleared, wandering mobs or seemingly
any other variable. As I did, you are even afforded the luxury of logging off,
resuming RL, then logging back on to await the next PH. The spawn rate is <i> that</i>
static. <b><u> Note:</u></b> Logging off is not recommended, as anyone wandering by can begin
camping Grimrot, unaware you have been for some time. Stealing a camp on Rallos
has nasty results, I highly recommend doing this with friends or your guild to
avoid losing the Grimrot Spawn.</font></p>

SPAWN/DROPS</u></b></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I was most
fortunate with Grimrot's drops. The first version that spawned was the Skeletal
version, I can only assume it was ~25th level as has been often reported; I was
much too high to accurately con and can only guess according the the <i> Harm Touch</i>
I received. The Skeletal Lord Grimrot summons a pet, has good Magic resistance
and Harm Touches for ~250. When killed, he dropped the DECAYING HEART (magic,
lore, nodrop). This is
one component of the quest. He also dropped a Pestilence Scythe (lore). The Scythe was
<i>not nodrop</i>.&nbsp; This is a very important point; the scythe you must use
for the quest drops from the Human version and IS MAGIC, LORE and NODROP. Please ensure that you
simply destroy the droppable scythe, this will avoid confusion and perhaps
even a mistake when handing the items in later.</font></p>

Human version finally spawned, it was several PHs after.&nbsp; He is dressed in
full plate mail, and wields the Pestilence Scythe to great effect.&nbsp; He may also summon a
pet if he has time, but I attacked him as soon as he spawned so he was unable to
buff or to summon an undead servant.&nbsp; <b><u>Note:</u></b>&nbsp; Please be careful, this version of Lord
Grimrot is ~38th level and HARM TOUCHES. His HT amounted to ~380hp right off the bat. He is
VERY Magic Resistant, ~100-120mr I would guess, and uses <i>Sap Strengh</i> and <i>Lifetap</i>
as often as he swings; this prolongs the fight significantly.&nbsp; Also, any of
the Putrid Skeletons that are in the area will agro you.&nbsp; This may be
because of your close proximity to them, or it may be an effect that Lord
Grimrot causes, I do not know this.&nbsp; As I fought him, I had four Putrid
Skeletons on me as well.&nbsp; Be careful.&nbsp; When the human Lord Grimrot fell, he dropped TWO SCYTHES.
Both were named <i> Pestilence Scythe</i>, but ONE was nodrop, the other was the same
kind dropped by his Skeletal version.&nbsp; The nodrop scythe is the one used
for the quest.&nbsp; As with the Skeletal Lord Grimrot, I highly suggest
deleting the other scythe, it has terrible stats and will only serve to confuse
later.</font></p>

while camping Grimrot, and had them all with me when it came time to do faction
work.&nbsp; Hand Lashun Novashine four (4) bone chips at a time, (1 in each
slot).&nbsp; This will result in some xp (very little) and a faction
adjustment.&nbsp; He will also cast <i>Minor Healing</i> on you every
time.&nbsp; You'll get used to it.&nbsp; In my work to get from Dubious faction
until I handed in the quest items, I ended up giving Lashun Novashine ~32 STACKS

donations and you will get +Temple of Life.&nbsp; So, I found out that you can
offer him 4gp at a time and get both +faction and a <i>Cure Disease</i>.&nbsp;
Annoying, but you'll get used to it.&nbsp; Now, instead of buying stacks and
stacks of bone chips ~5pp/stack in any newbie zone, it's much more economical to
hand him cash.&nbsp; (This is provided that the two quests offer the <u>same</u>
