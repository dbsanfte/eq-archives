      <blockquote> 
        <p>&#9;<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
          was silence, but only for a brief moment before the reaction to Drakken’s 
          statement. Shouts of &quot;No!&quot;; &quot;It is not possible!&quot;; 
          &quot;You can’t!&quot; were are said simultaneously, along with comments 
          made in languages not readily translated.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#9;What 
          had started out as a celebration for the initiation of new officers 
          of the Shadow Gypsies turned to chaos. Frith, Orcaa, Demay and Drapkin 
          the new inducted officers, were not sure how to take Drakken’s announcement. 
          Drakken had made his comment with no preamble, it was simply stated 
          and took everyone by surprise. His statement was, &quot;I am leaving 
          the Shadow Gypsies and some of you may not ever see me again.&quot; 
          The reactions were as varied as the guild membership. Shanna and Whitefalcon 
          leapt to their feet as one, Whitefalcon’s mouth open, Shanna staring 
          intently at Drakken. Parrin stood and watched Drakken almost as if he 
          had expected this announcement and called Medwin and Myutin to him. 
          Alendar nearly dropped one of the knives he was balancing. Mordantyr 
          remained seated but his brow was more furrowed than usual. The new officers, 
          unsure how to react in their new positions given this pronouncement 
          looked at each other and the more experienced officers. The membership 
          was in a state of confusion. Lenerin winced in pain as he hit the table 
          with his bandaged right hand. Mourde, Gwerdon and others were in a state 
          of inebriation and were not quite sure what was going on. Menelvagor 
          missed a note on his lute and stopped playing.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#9;&quot;You 
          can’t leave, we have come far but have much further yet to go&quot;, 
          said Shanna. &quot;This is not a decision I have come to lightly, I 
          have thought about the ramifications of me leaving.&quot;, Drakken responded. 
          He continued, &quot;Leaving was certainly not an easy decision, but 
          there are things on the horizon, events that will occur that necessitate 
          my departure.&quot; Alendar had heard as much as he could before his 
          temper and curiosity got the better of him, &quot;Where will you go?&quot;, 
          &quot;What will you do?&quot;, &quot;When are you leaving? I will go 
          with you, you will need someone with my scouting abilities!&quot; After 
          Alendar’s outburst, a rasping chuckle was heard coming from the shadows, 
          in a corner. A hooded, robed figured stepped to the edge of the light, 
          &quot;Still questioning the Keeper and his motives, boy? I see you have 
          a lot left to learn.&quot; And to Drakken, &quot;It appears that this 
          is the proper time to depart.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#9;The 
          mysterious figure had the effect of silencing all chaos in the room; 
          all eyes and ears were on him...her...it. The figure spoke further, 
          &quot;You have all become complacent. You have discovered part of The 
          Way and now you act as if the search is over. I am telling you it has 
          just begun! The Way is not something to be found on pieces of parchment 
          throughout Norrath, it is more... oh so much more than that. You have 
          much to seek, to learn, to discover. The trials and tribulations of 
          this group, these Shadow Gypsies as you call yourselves, are just beginning. 
          Drakken finally understands this... that is why he must leave. There 
          will come a time when each of you must be ready to drive yourselves 
          beyond your limits, you must face and endure personal trials and challenges. 
          Drakken is ready, he must leave and leave now... at least one of you 
          here knows and understands that. You must grow beyond him, you have 
          depended upon him too much. I have said more than I should or am allowed, 
          Drakken, name your successor and we must go.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Drakken 
          turned to face the gypsies, firelight dancing across his austere features. 
          &quot;This, at least, was an easy decision. There are events unfolding 
          that will have far reaching effects on Norrath and the Shadow Gypsies. 
          I had to choose someone that has been with me long, has been through 
          and seen many of the things I have. Someone that already has the respect 
          of our society... Shanna Mistwolf, you will be the leader of the Shadow 
          Gypsies.&quot; With almost complete acceptance, the membership nodded 
          in agreement; with the exception of two who looked at each other with 
          sidelong glances. Shanna stood and began, &quot;I, of course, accept 
          this...&quot; and was interrupted when the door slammed open.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In flew 
          a Dark Elf in an obvious rage, &quot;Where do you think you are going!? 
          I have not given you permission to go anywhere, you have yet to complete 
          what we have started! You are leaving all your work unprotected.&quot; 
          Dreyn... several of the Shadow Gypsies knew enough about him from Drakken 
          that even if they had not ever seen him, they knew this was he. Dreyn 
          was breathing hard, Drakken had never seen him this angry... in fact, 
          had never seen him angry at all, just arrogant and sarcastic. Before 
          Drakken could respond to Dreyn, the figure from the shadows spoke; &quot;Dreyn, 
          you really must learn to remain calm, remember your blood pressure.&quot; 
          and laughed softly. &quot;You!?&quot;, said Dreyn, &quot;What are you 
          doing here? This has nothing to do with you and your kind.&quot; Without 
          even seeing the shadowy figure’s face, he seemed to command with his 
          presence, &quot;Has nothing to do with?!? This has everything to do 
          with all we know! You are told only what you need to know by your masters; 
          this is bigger than you, it is bigger than I. There are events that 
          are unfolding that bear close watching. Events that are obviously beyond 
          your ken. Silence, Dreyn, and begone, there are important issues here 
          that you are not meant to be involved in.&quot; Dreyn sputtered, he 
          had never been talked to in those tones before. Drakken laughed, yes...laughed 
          as he watched Dreyn; &quot;The decision to leave, as hard as it was, 
          was worth it to see Dreyn react like this.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Drakken 
          stood at the head of the table, &quot;It is time, my friends, I must 
          go and I must go now. There is no time for long goodbyes. I will miss 
          you and I will not forget about you. Be safe, be well and above all... 
          be watchful.&quot; Drakken bowed, then the figure came to his side and 
          they turned and left... it was simple and uneventful. All eyes turned 
          to Dreyn, when he realized that he was being watched, he left without 
          a word and slammed the door behind him.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shanna 
          slowly moved to the head of the table, the place of the Keeper. She 
          raised her head and had a solemn look on her face. Her first words, 
          &quot;We have much to discuss...&quot;</font></p>
