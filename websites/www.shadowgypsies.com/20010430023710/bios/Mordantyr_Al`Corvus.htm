          <P align=left>It had been a long, strange and difficult road that had 
            brought Mordantyr to the cracked landscape of Lavastorm. He could 
            sense that the beginning had finally begun…the first part of this 
            thing called "The Way" had been found. But as he stood atop the deep 
            lava pool, he reflected on the path that brought him here… </P>
          <P align=left>Abandoned as an infant on the steps of the Necromantic 
            Guild on Odus, it seemed he was an outcast from his own age group 
            as well. Other children shunned him, he was different, dark, and brooding 
            even for a Necromancer. The mentors and prefects were interested in 
            him…he seemed to have a gift. Mordantyr was a quick study, but more 
            than that, he was able to assimilate and make deductions and inferences 
            quicker and more accurately than most, if not all, the mentors he 
            had. As such, he was given more reading and research assignments than 
            the other acolytes. This further set him apart from others his own 
            age…they viewed him as more of a "teacher’s pet", which for a Necromancer 
            can turn out to be quite deadly. The irony was not lost on him. For 
            solace and respite, Mordantyr took to the tower rooms, and began to 
            associate with the large, black birds that flew up there. They became 
            his pets. When it came time for him to choose a surname, it was from 
            this that he chose it…al’Corvus in the old language, meaning The Raven. 
            From that point on, he was known to his guild as Mordantyr, The Raven. 
          </P>
          <P align=left>Growing up in the Necromancer’s Guild was an experience 
            outsiders, those impudent fools from Erudin, did not understand. Discipline 
            was interesting….to be punished, you were given to the Guild Priests 
            of Cazic Thule; for rewards, you were also given to the Guild Priests 
            of Cazic Thule. Fear was your Father and Death was your mother; the 
            Guild itself was the limited, mortal representation of each. You grew 
            to know Fear, to use Fear and to know that Death was not an end, merely 
            a beginning. </P>
          <P align=left>As Mordantyr grew, so did his responsibilities as an up 
            and coming Guild scholar. People brought him old texts to read and 
            study. He liked the older books, the look and touch of the pages made 
            of cured flesh made him feel comfortable. He enjoyed playing a little 
            game; he liked to touch the pages of various books with his eyes closed 
            to try and guess what race’s skin was used for which book. He learned 
            to determine that quite quickly. Over time, it became clear to him 
            that the Guild was using his abilities, his gift for its own ends 
            with no real regard for Mordantyr himself. Were they that foolish 
            that he could not see this? It is well known throughout the Necromancers 
            that the ultimate path, the true and final existence is that of the 
            Liche, the personification of Fear and Death, in one entity. The end 
            goal of every Necromancer…and they thought that he would hand them 
            that information? HA! </P>
          <P align=left>In one of the old books, he found the beginning of a thread, 
            the seed of a concept. He had not noticed this before, and if he did 
            not see it, he was sure none of the scholars noticed it. Mordantyr 
            rapidly started poring over other books and scrolls that were strewn 
            around the room. The room was in disarray, there were books, scrolls, 
            parchment, piles of bones everywhere but he was sure that he had something, 
            although the concept was nebulous, the translation was clear. His 
            path, his ultimate path was to be gained by following something called 
            "A Way" or "The Way". He was sure this would lead to the Necromancers 
            panacea….Lichdom. But in order to seek this thing out, he would have 
            to leave the sanctity of the Necromancer’s Towers. Well no one said 
            this would be easy, he would be facing the whole of Norrath for the 
            first time. As if on cue, a large raven flew in the window with a 
            human eye in it’s mouth which it dropped on the table and began feasting 
            upon. Is it that time already, thought Mordantyr. He stood at the 
            window and looked down at the three people hanging from a cross in 
            the courtyard of the guild. Foolish Erudites, he thought, that would 
            come and try to kill or capture any of the guild. He toyed with some 
            finger bones he had taken from the female; Yes, he thought, she would 
            make an adequate pet for my journey. "Xantik!", he called, and a pile 
            of bones shifted on the floor…Yesssss, Massssterrrrr said the creature 
            after it formed into a skeleton. "Clean up this room and put the books 
            back where they belong…I shan’t return for quite some time." </P>
          <P align=left>So his journeys began. Mordantyr traveled to places he 
            had never heard of all the while covertly looking for this elusive 
            path of power. On one occasion, in the middle of the night, he happened 
            upon a stranger, Coumadin by name. They talked and Coumadin dropped 
            the name of the Shadow Gypsies as a group that he should look into. 
            Certainly an interesting turn of events…the Shadow Gypsies…this should 
            warrant further investigation. About a week later, he ran into another…a 
            female, Fazalin, was it? The name was cloudy. She also talked of these 
            Shadow Gypsies…most fascinating. From this point he traveled Norrath 
            looking for these Shadow Gypsies, but they seemed to live up to their 
            name and were very elusive, and entirely impossible to find. While 
            in South Karana, the cry went up that someone was in search of a corpse; 
            certainly, being a Necromancer his interest was piqued. It seemed 
            that a small band of people needed the location of a fellow’s body; 
            Shanna, Whitefalcon and Parrin. Most odd seeing a Dark Elf and Wood 
            Elf traveling together, even more surprising when they said they were 
            due to get married. They spoke briefly, then Mordantyr performed the 
            rite of corpse location – a simple service - and went their separate 
            ways. </P>
          <P align=left>Imagine his surprise when Mordantyr later discovered that 
            they were all members of the Shadow Gypsies…well this opportunity 
            could not be disregarded. It seemed the fates were pushing him in 
            a certain direction. Mordantyr contacted Shanna and they spoke at 
            length…they spoke of each other, the Shadow Gypsies and what goals 
            they may have in common. The repartee took on the look of a sparring 
            match more than a conversation, each one saying something but obviously 
            having an underlying meaning and intention. Eventually, Shanna spoke 
            of The Way, which spurred Mordantyr even further…perhaps this is indeed 
            the society that the gods had been pushing him towards. Shanna took 
            Mordantyr to meet the Shadow Gypsy Guild leader, Drakken. When they 
            met, Mordantyr was in shock. Drakken was a troll…"A TROLL!?", he thought. 
            "How can a creature as lowly as A TROLL be entrusted with something 
            written about for ages, something of such obvious power." Obviously 
            he had to be mistaken, the Shadow Gypsies was not the right group. 
            But then, Drakken turned and spoke to Mordantyr and he saw that this 
            troll was different. There was such a spark behind the eyes, seemingly 
            a light of some importance…that Mordantyr did not act upon his first 
            impression. He waited and they conversed. Drakken admitted Mordantyr 
            into the Shadow Gypsies right then and there, further proof of this 
            trolls intelligence, thought Mordantyr. And so, Mordantyr would wait 
            and bide his time and see where this new path would take him. </P>
          <P align=left>Soon after, Drakken had somehow determined that the Goblin 
            King in Solusek’s Eye had the first piece of The Way. An expedition 
            was lead into the king’s stronghold, the first two forays were unsuccessful; 
            in the third, they were triumphant. It had appeared that the King 
            had entrusted this information with one of his Champions…a mistake 
            I assume he is regretting to this day. Now, the first part of The 
            Way has been made known to Mordantyr, and his path to discover the 
            complete Way, his path to power, to the Way of the Liche is begun. 
            But questions remain, Are the Shadow Gypsies as a group, worthy of 
            this information? Is Drakken, although a soldier of the dead, the 
            proper one to watch, safeguard and keep this information? How many 
            others have now heard of our discovery and are watching us? And finally…How 
            do I discover the ultimate path to Lichdom from The Way? </P>
          <P align=left>Mordantyr heaves a sigh that is lost in the hot wind across 
            Lavastorm, his reverie at an end. He watches Drakken, Shanna, Parrin, 
            Whitefalcon and all the others that procured part one of The Way from 
            the Champions dead fingers…and wonders. He will have to watch, and 
            wait, and see….oh yes, he shall see... </P>
