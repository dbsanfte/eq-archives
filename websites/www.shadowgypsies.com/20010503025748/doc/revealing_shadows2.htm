          <div align="left"> <font face="Arial">Drakken's mood was foul as he 
            threw open the door to his abode, causing it to smash against the 
            door. He walked over to the spit over the fireplace, and rammed an 
            orc thigh on it, put it over the already burning fire, and slammed 
            the door, causing wall to shake from the force of it.</font> 
            <p><font
    face="Arial">Dropping into the chair at his desk, his eyes slowly took in 
                the contents of one of the letters, causing his already stormy 
                countenance to become even more so. Sighing, he dropped the parchment 
                and covered his face with large, green, and callused hands. When 
                would the Grobb council get it through their thick heads? Within 
                the paleskin ranks are those who are not our enemy! Why do they 
                INSIST on warring for no reason?</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">Drakken jumped slightly at the knock on the 
                door, then growled &quot;Come in.&quot; The door swung back to 
                reveal Orcaa, who noted Drakken's foul mood with a concerned look.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Drakk? I's gotta talk to ya.&quot; Orcaa 
                said, still hesitating at the door, not quite sure if he had come 
                at a good time. Drakken waved him to a chair by his desk, signaling 
                that it was ok. After all they had been through together, Drakk 
                could still not understand Orcaa's hesitance.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;What's on your mind, old friend?&quot; 
                he asked. Orcaa fidgeted a moment before beginning.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Drakk, its da others. Dey are beginnin' 
                to wonder if the gods like us still. It's been a long time now, 
                and a new &quot;Way&quot; has not been showed us.&quot; Orcaa 
                looked even more nervous, and Drakken suddenly understood the 
                reason for Orcaa's discomfort, for he was loyal to the end, and 
                yet was somehow elected to talk to him about the delicate subject 
                of &quot;The Way.&quot; Drakken sighed in weariness.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Orcaa, how long have you known me?&quot; 
                Drakken asked. Orcaa was silent a moment, as if thinking, then 
                shrugged.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;I dunno. Been long tyme. Before we change 
                into dis.&quot; he answered, spreading his muscular troll arms.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;In all that time, has I ever let you 
                down?&quot; Drakken asked. Orcaa thought again, then grinned mischievously.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Yeah, ya didn't by me a beer last night.&quot; 
                He answered, bearing his teeth in a beastlike grin. Drakken laughed, 
                glad that Orcaa understood.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Orcaa, Drakk is doing his best, and 
                it WILL come...just takes time.&quot; Drakken answered. Orcaa 
                nodded, seeming to be content with the answer, and stood and went 
                to the door.Drakken stood to see him off, then closed the door.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Seems like you are running out of time, 
                my ugly friend.&quot; Drakken whirled at the sound of the new 
                voice, and saw the Strange little dark elf again.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Oh, you. Next time knock. Drakk not 
                like unannounced visitors.&quot; Drakk said, as he crossed his 
                arms. He did not like the way this strange dark elf made him feel 
                so weak, just be being here. The little elf merely smiled.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Well now, it's good to see you too.&quot; 
                He said, jumping up from where he was seated on Drakken's desk. 
                &quot;Hmm...now where were we....Oh yeah! The books.&quot; he 
                said, picking up where they last left off, as if hardly a day 
                had passed, instead of a full cycle of the moon.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;You see, there is an interesting story...interesting 
                indeed, for even I am interested in it. There is a man who walked 
                two worlds, much like yourself, it seems. Hmm...hadn't thought 
                of that....&quot; the elf seemed to drift as he dwelt a moment 
                on what appeared to be an immensely deep thought. Drakken roughly 
                cleared his throat.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Ah, sorry...lost me there for a moment, 
                did you? Where was I...ah yes, the man who walked two worlds. 
                His name was Jonas, though not the Jonas D'accor you knew on your 
                previous world. He was a simple man, though properly smart. His 
                passing was barely missed but by a few, and those few collected 
                his letters, and what they could of his life, and compiled them 
                into several volumes of books. These books are extremely rare, 
                and, in truth, I do not know there specific locations. However, 
                I do know that one is buried beneath the Karanas, guarded by a 
                magic user of some sort, in a dungeon. Another may be found to 
                the north, perhaps near where a Barbarian warrior protects its 
                words - I would, perhaps, wander the tundra in hopes of finding 
                the warrior. I KNEW that a third was hidden in Kaladim, but a 
                Erudite, seeking some special knowledge of gating stole that, 
                and some other nameless tome, and the last...being the fourth 
                is known to be in the possession of a wood elf druid, whose curiosity 
                will not allow him to easily give it up.&quot; the little elf 
                finished. Drakken stood in shock at the geographical diversity 
                of locations.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Drakk cannot go to these places!&quot; 
                He shouted in indignation. &quot;I will get killed by paleskins!&quot; 
                Drakken growled dangerously, wanting to crush the little elf, 
                yet knowing better.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Who says YOU have to go?&quot; the little 
                elf replied.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Yeah right! Then how is Drakk supposed 
                to know the where in those areas you tole' me where to go? How 
                is Drakk supposed to know who are the names? How..&quot;</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Careful, my ugly friend. Your anger 
                is robbing you of your ability to speak clearly.&quot; the little 
                elf interrupted. Drakken's face turned dark green as he sputtered 
                angrily, then drove his fist down, hitting his desk and splitting 
                it with a thunderous crack, while releasing a roar of frustration 
                and anger.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Tsk, tsk. I see you have not quite controlled 
                that anger of yours.&quot; the little elf sighed. &quot;It seems 
                that you inherited that troll temper...ah...oh well. I see you 
                are not ready to continue. Goodbye&quot; And with that, the dark 
                elf again vanished as before, leaving a livid Drakken behind to 
                pick up the pieces of his broken desk...</font>
