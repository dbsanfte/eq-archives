        -- History &amp; Storyline</b></font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCCFF"> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p>In keeping with our physical history (several years of online roleplaying), 
            the Shadow Gypsies have developed quite a collection of stories, legends, 
            successful (and failed) quests, and roleplay biographies.</p>
          <p>"Seek and ye shall find. Quest and ye shall receive. Train and ye 
            shall prevail." You might say that this sums up our present situation, 
            but the reality goes much much deeper. In order to understand where 
            we are and more importantly where we're going, you need to see where 
            we've been and what we've accomplished.</p>
          
        <p>The most recent major historical event, the <a href="doc/current.htm" target="_self">Disappearance 
          of Drakken</a>, still has many of us perplexed.</p>
          
        <p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" face="Arial" size="3">What has 
          Come to Pass</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="3">It was 
          a new world, a dawning of a new age for those known simply as the Shadow 
          Gypsies, and perhaps a darker, more sinister era for us all.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="3">After thousands 
          of years of following the discipline of &quot;The Way,&quot; a war of 
          cataclysmic proportions shook the world, and in the aftermath, only 
          few remained, picking up the ruins of the books and scrolls which held 
          &quot;The Way.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="3">Lan also 
          perished, shouting out in agony as dark magics twisted, contorted, and 
          finally destroyed him, body and soul, as if he never existed, while 
          Drakken, an Aegis of &quot;The Way&quot; watched in horror, unable to 
          help.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="3">The remaining 
          Shadow Gypsies, no longer held by the discipline of &quot;The Way&quot; 
          were scattered throughout a new world that had emerged after the cataclysm, 
          known only as Norrath. Their bodies, and minds changing, growing more 
          sinister, and darker in their thoughts, and minds. No longer were they 
          after justice, for their thoughts and perceptions changed, as they too, 
          aged, and grew wiser. They had learned that no matter how hard they 
          tried, justice would never be served, because people&#146;s perception 
          of justice changed from person to person. What was just in one person&#146;s 
          eyes, was abominable in another&#146;s eyes. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="3">Thus the 
          remaining Shadow Gypsies sought another source of justice; another manifestation 
          of law to guide them&#133;.they sought power. Power through strength, 
          mystery, and through upholding a law of their own. They were not evil, 
          yet here was a sinister side of the Shadow Gypsies, that was a storm 
          brewing on the horizon, for they lacked the certain direction of &quot;The 
          Way.&quot;</font></p>
