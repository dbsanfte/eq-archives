          <div align="left"><font face="Tahoma">Drakken's eyes were bloodshot, 
            his shoulders drooped, his ringmail rent in many places from battles 
            past, and a deep cut in his side gnawed at him, angrily reminding 
            him of his short fight with the chasm minotaur a few days before...all 
            for some lousy axe. Now, neriak's cool, humid air surrounded him, 
            and the guards eyed him dubiously, as if waiting for an excuse to 
            attack.</font> 
            <p><font
    face="Tahoma">He had searched the dangerous crags of Highpass Hold, battled 
                uselessly with Zhalfirin and Coumadin in the hot and humid air 
                of Runneye Cave, Wandered aimlessly in the Beholder's Maze with 
                Shanna, and even fought mindlessly in the reaches of East Karana 
                with Elfmann, yet, he had found nothing but many more wounds, 
                a list of scars that will join the others which will one day make 
                good stories, and a bone deep exhaustion.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Tahoma">After arriving in Neriak - not even knowing 
                why he went there - Drakken soon found himself in the library, 
                an very rare occasion for Trollkind. He stood there, with the 
                dust of the road still covering him, and his now marred and tired-looking 
                halberd held loosly in a now thickly-calloused hand, looking upon 
                the shelves upon shelves of books, while the nearby Tier'Dal librarian 
                openly smirked at this &quot;dumb Troll,&quot; playing at being 
                interested in reading.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Tahoma">&quot;Perhaps a book on Solusek Dungeon will 
                wet your appetite.&quot; Drakken turn with amazing agility for 
                a Troll, swinging his halberd in a vicious arc, causing the terrified 
                Teir'Dal librarian to leap back just in time. Yelping an exclamation, 
                the librarian scurried back to his desk, frantically fishing in 
                one of its drawers before pulling out a small dagger.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Tahoma">&quot;P-put th-that thing down!&quot; he 
                stammered, while pointing at the halberd with his empty hand. 
                Drakken merely smiled and looked at the puny dagger the small 
                elf held, then rumbled a quiet laugh.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Tahoma">&quot;Drakk is sorry, elfie, but I will not 
                part with my weapon. It has taken me through battles with evil 
                eyes, Minotaurs, the curse dazed goblin warriors, tentical terrors, 
                countless crocodiles, orcs, gnolls of all kinds....I would gladly 
                give my soul to Inuruuk before I gave you my weapon.&quot; Drakk 
                rumbled, his voice seeming to reverbate off of the library walls. 
                The Teir'Dal stood still a moment, as if sizing up Drakken, then 
                realized how futile he looked, with only a dagger, and the Troll 
                in full armor, and a vicious looking halberd that seemed to glow 
                with a soft, magical light. Sighing, he carefully lay the dagger 
                on his desktop.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Tahoma">&quot;I was told to expect you. My name is 
                D'artagnan E'ltrover.&quot; D'artagnan chuckled &quot;I must admit, 
                when he told me to expect a Troll, I thought he had lost his mind, 
                only once before had a Troll graced these halls, and even then, 
                it was only because he was persueing a known murderer, not in 
                quest of knowledge.&quot; Drakkens eyes brightened slightly.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Tahoma">&quot;Who told you to expect me?&quot; Drakken 
                asked. The librarian's eyebrows arched in obvious surprise.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Tahoma">&quot;Why, Dreyn of course!&quot; He answered. 
                At the look of bafflement on Drakken's face, D'artagnan continued, 
                &quot;He is a messenger of the gods, especially Inuruuk, and a 
                necromancer of high power. He told me you quested to find some 
                kind of &quot;Way,&quot; or something like that, and then he pointed 
                out this book for you to read.&quot; The Teir'Dal laid a finger 
                on the book he had put down, in favor of his dagger. Drakken looked 
                a moment at the book, it was old, its hard leather cover well 
                worn with age, and the parchment within it old, creased, and dirty.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Tahoma">&quot;How old is that book? drakk not wanna 
                ruin it.&quot; Drakken asked, as he walked nearer to the book. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Tahoma">D'artagnan again smirked. &quot;I have another 
                copy of it that I have scribed. Why dont you take that one, and 
                keep it? It is the original though, so be tender with it.&quot; 
                Drakken grinned his thanks as he picked up the book and headed 
                towards the nearest small table, and woefully undersized chairs 
                to read it when the librarian cleared his throat, again capturing 
                Drakken's attention.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Tahoma">&quot;We do have chairs for...people of larger 
                stature.&quot; he said, pointing towards the other end of the 
                hall, which held one large table, complete with four large chairs. 
                Drakken grinned again, as he walked over to the chairs of suitable 
                size, sat in one, and began to read...</font></p>
              <p><big><font color="#FF0000" face="Tahoma">Solusek</font></big></p>
              <p><font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">Drakken lost track of time, 
                as he was immediately immersed in the history of a dragon who 
                once walked Norrath freely, then suddenly was reported to be imprisoned 
                in the dungeon of Solusek. There were some vague references to 
                the dragon being &quot;punished,&quot; but for some reason, Drakken 
                was not interested in that. No, the real interest came when he 
                read of certain items having been lost through idiocy of travellers 
                who thought themsleves strong enough to brave the dangers of the 
                dungeon alone. Among those items lost were three items....</font>
