<div align="left">
Treeno was born to a poor family in the city of Erudin.  Unable to support their small family his parents gave him to the Temple of Divine Light.  He never knew his parents.  His family was the church, his mother
Quellios.<br>
<br>
At the age of 13 Treeno and Eina, a young friend, were playing in the forest just outside of town.  A kobold runt spotted them and rounded up some of its pack.  The kobolds attacked Eina as she hid from Treeno in a small grove.  She tried to fight them off but to no avail.  She died just as Treeno ran to her call for help.  Seeing her on the ground with the kobolds picking at her stuff,  Treeno ran at the kobolds with a cry of rage.  He fought hard killing one and wounding another but he could feel his life force wane.  Then as he was about fall, a glowing light surrounded him.  A feeling of peace swept though his body and he swung his sword at the wounded kobold.  It fell to the ground.  With new hope and strength Treeno turned on the last Kobold.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Later that day Treeno went to the High Priest and told him what had happened.  The priest took young Treeno to a small wing of the temple and gave him to Depnar
Bulrious, master of the peacekeepers.  It is here that Treeno began his training as a paladin.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Some years later Treeno was approached by the church for a very important mission.  He was to escort five erudites from Qeynos to
Faydark.  They carried a book that must be kept from the dark elfs at all cost.  Unknown to Treeno this trip was ill-fated.  His immediate charge Leexa stumbled and fell over a cliff on the way to high hold.  Upset by the loss, He climbed down the rock face and performed the last rights.  Solemnly he took the book and carried it back to the party.<br>
<br>
In High Hold the group prepared for the next half of their trip.  When suddenly a guard attacked one of his companions for reasons he did not know.  In disbelief they left High Hold.  Their misfortune would not end there however.  Kithcore Wood held another challenge.  In the dark gloom of the forest the group became separated.  There plan was the meet a the edge of the woods and regroup.  They did not know the Dark Elfs would be there waiting for them.&nbsp;<br>
In a mad dash for safety the group became even more separated.  Another friend fell.  Down hearted Treeno ran on for he had heard the book had reached Freeport.  There was nothing he could do for the fallen now.<br>
<br>
At the docks the survivors gathered.  Many who had traveled with his companions arrived at the dock as well.  Cheers rose up praising the gods for there relative success so far.  With out warning a surge of energy ran though Treeno's muscles.  He began to move around the dock out of control. Fear griped him as he realized some one had taken control of his body.  His could feel his hand reach down and grab his sword.  He could not stop it.  The cold steel felt like rotting flesh in his hand as he began to swing it at a noble young halfling standing next to him.   He could not stop.  Out of the corner of his eye Treeno spotted one of his fellow erudites being blasted by dark magic.  He could not stop it.  Then the enchantment wore off.  He looked around.  Faeladara was dead.  The book was gone.  He had failed.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In self-pity and disgrace, the once proud Treeno fell in to a state of drunkenness. For 2 years he traveled the lands with eyes down cast.  Hoping no one would remember his name.  He became friends with drunks even fighting along side Necromancers and a Dark Elven rogue named
Thess..  Until Depnar his guild master found him one day, face down in a brothel.  His armor in disrepair, and his once fine blade rusting away.  As Treeno looked up into Depnar's eyes he could see the love of Quellios there and knew he was not forgotten.  He would become her tool once again.  His name would hold Honor and Wisdom once more.
