          <P align=left>"Sssnaaaaap!" went the twang of the bowstring as Whitefalcon 
            practiced on Orcs in the Greater Faydark. The arrows would rarely 
            fell them in one shot, but he was so fast with the bow that it didn't 
            matter. His Ranger skills were becoming very acute. </P>
          <P align=left>"Darn" he sighed. He was wasting time, and he knew it. 
            But he had little choice. </P>
          <P align=left>"Why the long face, White?" asked his companion, Parrin, 
            a Druid. </P>
          <P align=left>"I'm waiting for someone." he said simply. </P>
          <P align=left>"Who?" ask Parrin. </P>
          <P align=left>White didn't answer. </P>
          <P align=left>"Ahhh, well I think I know. If if you need me, I'll be 
            around." </P>
          <P align=left>White grumbled. He went back to his practicing on Orcs. 
            It was so mind-numbing that he remembered his origins here in this 
            very place... </P>
          <P align=left>Whitefalcon started life in the treetops of Kelethin, 
            as many rangers do, hunting orcs and battling in the broken enclave 
            of Crushbone, honing his skills not for pleasure, but to keep himself 
            alive. He was taught the bow at a young age, and learned to master 
            it early... and before long was forced to leave home to seek other 
            hunting grounds. </P>
          <P align=left>He traveled through Butcherblock, marveling at the mountains 
            and the small, but very tough, dwarves who fought there. He found 
            his way to a great ocean, and got on the boat, trembling as it rocked 
            to and fro. He was in awe of the trip, marveling again at the aqua 
            goblins and other creatures of the sea as he passed. </P>
          <P align=left>(he shot another orc) </P>
          <P align=left>Then he arrived in Freeport, and was immediately frightened. 
            On the trip over, he had heard stories of humans killing elves! Not 
            just for profit or mere racial hatred, but sometimes for fun, which 
            was even more dangerous. </P>
          <P align=left>He fought for a while in the Commonlands and in Ro, then 
            on to Highhold Pass, where he fought more orcs -- these much much 
            stronger, and so he continued to hone his skills. </P>
          <P align=left>A chance meeting with Zhalfirin and Coumadin brought him 
            into the company of the Shadow Gypsies, and for the second time in 
            his life he felt he had a family again. </P>
          <P align=left>(he shot another orc) </P>
          <P align=left>Not too long after that, he spotted a young dark elf with 
            kind features and pale blue skin who was talking to Zhalfirin and 
            Coumadin. She was very young, not being far past the second circle 
            of spells, and was intending to travel to Grobb and the nearby swamp 
            in order to hunt. He was intrigued by her movements and manner and 
            they way she looked up to Zhal and Coum... or did they defer to her 
            somehow? </P>
          <P align=left>After a blessing from Coumadin, she left on her way. </P>
          <P align=left>He was wood elf and strong. She was dark elf and weak. 
            But he was still intrigued and began asking after her, discreetly 
            at first... </P>
          <P align=left>(he shot another orc) </P>
          <P align=left>Some hours later, Whitefalcon was resting by a tree when 
            he felt small, soft hands caress his cheek. He jumped up, ready for 
            a fight. </P>
          <P align=left>"Easy, luv. It is only I." said Shanna, his wife. </P>
          <P align=left>White sighed. "Took you long enough." he grumbled, then 
            smiled at her. </P>
          <P align=left>Shanna looked up at him and smirked, kissed him on the 
            cheek and stepped back to cast. After long moments, a portal opened 
            and they both stepped through. </P>
          <P align=left>They ended up in Nektulos Forest and began to head toward 
            Lavastorm and ultimately Nagafen's Lair. </P>
          <P align=left>Young dark elves yelled: "Wood elf in the Forest!" "Kill 
            him!" when they first saw him, but stopped making such a fuss when 
            they recognized him -- arm in arm with Shanna, a friend to many in 
            the Forest. </P>
          <P align=left>White and Shanna strolled passed the guards, ignoring 
            them. At one point they would have been a threat to Whitefalcon's 
            safety, but that was long ago. They also ignored the threats from 
            the younger people in the forest. </P>
          <P align=left>They slipped into Lavastorm and headed along on their 
            way... </P>
          <P align=left>Whitefalcon thought to himself that it wasn't always this 
            easy. It took a year of chasing Shanna before she would even talk 
            to him, and even more before she started to pay attention to him as 
            a friend, much less a lover. </P>
          <P align=left>He showered gifts upon her, followed her around assisting, 
            keeping bad things from killing her as she rested, and even assisted 
            in some fights when things started looking grim, but she still ignored 
            him. </P>
          <P align=left>"Go away, wood elf scum." she would snarl at him if he 
            sat too close. He would move away, always watching and protecting, 
            however, and keeping silent lest he incur more of her wrath. </P>
          <P align=left>As she grew stronger, she began to accept his presence 
            and sometimes even ask for him as a bodyguard -- not directly, of 
            course, but through her friends. </P>
          <P align=left>When she reached courting age, suitors came out of the 
            woodwork offering gifts and eternal loyalty, but she ignored all of 
            them. </P>
          <P align=left>One day, White decided to be bold and offer her a gift 
            of an engagement ring. </P>
          <P align=left>"What's this?" she demanded as she held the ring between 
            thumb and forefinger. </P>
          <P align=left>White just got down on one knee and begged her to accept 
            it. </P>
          <P align=left>"Please take this, if for nothing else than to prove that 
            I am yours to do with as you will." he pleaded. </P>
          <P align=left>"Bah!" she said. ...but she put the ring on anyway. </P>
          <P align=left>"Please marry me." he pleaded again. </P>
          <P align=left>"No." she said. "Not now, not ev..." she started to say 
            "ever" then backed off and smirked. He knew then that he had a chance... 
          </P>
          <P align=left>Many times, Whitefalcon saved her life, and at first she 
            didn't appreciate it, not knowing to what extents he was guarding 
            her. </P>
          <P align=left>Later, it became evident that he would sacrifice himself 
            for her, battling monsters to the death when she was too weak to continue, 
            or leading them off giving her time to escape. </P>
          <P align=left>Once, when she took on something too tough for her, he 
            fought it hand-to-hand down to a sliver of his own life while she 
            watched in amazement. </P>
          <P align=left>When the battle was over she cried, "Why do you do all 
            this for me, paleskin? You might have died in place of me." </P>
          <P align=left>He collapsed unconcious at her feet, bleeding all over 
            her nice white robe. She pondered him for a moment, then began to 
            bandage him as her meager skills allowed. When she was done, she wrapped 
            her arms around him, holding him close, and began to realize just 
            how important she must be to this man. </P>
          <P align=left>Another time they were battling in Mistmoore, going toe 
            to toe with a vampire, until it turned on her and started sucking 
            her lifeforce WAY too fast for her to live. </P>
          <P align=left>"GATE!" yelled Whitefalcon, "Get out of here! Live for 
            another day!" as he turned on the Vampire trying to taunt it off of 
            her. </P>
          <P align=left>Realizing that she was about to die, White simultaneously 
            started to heal her while she cast a gate spell that would get her 
            out alive, maybe. </P>
          <P align=left>Then the impossible happened! The vampire struck her unconsious, 
            Whitefalcon's heal hit her, she stood up, resumed concentration, and 
            completed the gate!!! </P>
          <P align=left>Secretly, she didn't consider herself worthy of his attentions 
            or affection. She was weak and he massivly muscled and strong at arms. 
            Things that would tear her up in a heartbeat he handled easily, all 
            to protect her. He could do so much alone, but yet held back from 
            his friends and advanced hunting spots just to be with her. </P>
          <P align=left>He was helping her grow stronger while at the same time 
            holding himself back from doing the same, and she decided right there 
            that one day she would marry him and take his name, but she didn't 
            let him know that quite yet. She'd tease him a while longer... </P>
          <P align=left>Whitefalcon was a wood elf and Shanna a dark elf. Their 
            relationship was condemned from the start by many, who stated that 
            it would never work, or even if it did that they would both be hunted 
            by both races. </P>
          <P align=left>But eventually it did work, and a LONG time afterward 
            they were married, amidst the death threats and scowls. </P>
          <P align=left>Now they are all but inseparable. His strength at arms 
            and her arcane magics combine to make a powerful team, both feared 
            and respected throughout Norrath. </P>
          <P align=left>And they are forever dedicated to each other. </P>
