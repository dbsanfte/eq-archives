<H2>Frequently Asked Questions</H2>
<H3>
<H3>
<H3>Do I have to participate in the banner exchange?</H3>       </H3></H3>
<P> No.&nbsp; If you only want to be listed in the 
directory, you can simply sign up and not participate in<BR>the banner 
exchange.&nbsp; (although you would be giving up free advertising for your site!)</P>
<H3>
<H3>    What are Ad Credits?</H3></H3>
<P>Ad credits are used to show your banner on other member's web sites.&nbsp; 
You earn 500 for free<BR>just for signing up!&nbsp; Members who participate in 
the banner exchange (show ads on their site)<BR>will earn even more 
credits.&nbsp; 1 ad credit = your banner shown 1 time on another web site.</P>
<H3>
<H3>Is there a limit to referrals or ratios?</H3></H3>
<P>None.&nbsp; If you refer a couple people and begin to&nbsp;earn better 
than&nbsp;a 1:1 ratio,&nbsp;great job!&nbsp; That's<BR> why we started this 
exchange.</P>
<H3>I have multiple sites, do I need multiple accounts?</H3>
<P>Depends.&nbsp; A single account allows you to&nbsp;run up to three banners at 
one time in your rotation.<BR>You could use these to advertise multiple EQ sites 
you own.&nbsp; If your sites vary by demographic <BR>type, (e.g. one is about&nbsp;a class 
and one is for your guild) then you may create multiple accounts.<BR>Just 
as long as you don't "stack". (see below)</P>
<H3>Can I become my own referrer?</H3>
<P>Nope.&nbsp; This is known as "stacking", and any member caught stacking will 
be booted!&nbsp; No<BR>exceptions, your account will go bye-bye and so will all 
those legitimate referrals you worked<BR> so hard for.&nbsp; If you have multiple accounts, you may 
have refferals for each, just not yourself.</P>
<H3>Can I run a more than one banner on a page?</H3>
<P>You may run only one&nbsp;EqSites banner ad on a single page.&nbsp; You may, however, 
run banner ads<BR>from other affiliate programs, including other banner 
exchanges, on&nbsp;the same&nbsp;page&nbsp;as your EqSites<BR>banner. Refer to the 
Terms and Conditions on the signup page for more detailed 
information.</P>
<H3>What size ads can I run?</H3>
<P>468x60 pixels, 16k or less in size, GIF file format.&nbsp; You may have up to 
three banners in your<BR>rotation.</P>
