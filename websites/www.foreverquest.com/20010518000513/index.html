		<TD> Tonight was another fun packed night in Fires Within. Tonight we killed 3 different mobs for epics and took out the boss of the hole Master Yael. First we went for Master Yael he went down with no trouble. The only deaths being from his DTs. Then for some reason the Scaekeeper got aggro and took us by suprise. He was running through the crowd whacking people before we knew he was there. Pretty smart on his part :) So after the CR we all got back up and went after our objective for the night High Scale Kirn for Lecores epic. Along the way we stopped to take out Jael The Insane for Luan's epic. Then we killed the Ghost of Kindle for Xmiru's chanter epic. the we finally pulled High Scale Kirn and put a hurting on him. After that we decided it was time to get even with the Scalekeeper for sneaking up on use while fighting Yael. So we gathered the troops and headed down to Master Yael's lair. The we put a ho smacking down on the Scalekeeper. He dropped the red scale for the Warrior/Bard epic. There was various loot dropped along the way. Grats to all those who got something. All in all a very successful night. 4 epics parts our of the way and one more dead boss mob to add to our list. <BR>
