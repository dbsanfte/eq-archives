        <p>Hey all...A few updates on the goings on of XA. We attempted our first 
          Vindi hit last week. We were unsuccessful in droppin the biatch, but 
          got damn close for our first try. We plan on going for it again next 
          week sometime...we'll keep you updated. </p>
        <p>Currently XA is camped in Plane of Air trying to get Muza and Lenudormepic 
          pieces that they need, if all goes well we will try for the 7th isle 
          to get crowns for mage epic as well. C'yas all on..</p>

        <p>XA stomped thru CoM last night. Really fun for all involved, Fortaz 
          and Ysygwyrthyr finally finished both of their epics, huge grats for 
          both foofs. Zodiak got a piece for his epic as well. The guild went 
          to HoT in ToV afterwards but I had to log so no clue how that went. 
          Anyway, I am sure we'll be doin somethin tonight so C'yas all there.</p>

        <p>Hey all....long time no post. Haven't had much time over christmas 
          due to work and family bein in town, but looks like things are getting 
          back to normal now. We are going to start having more raids...guilds 
          been kinda lax due to Luclin coming out and people wanting to explore 
          n what not. Anyway...expect more posts and getting back to a regular 
          hunting scedule. Cyas in-game =).</p>

        <p><b><font size="4">01/05/02: </font></b></p>
        <p>Well, obviously the site is back up now. I guess flatland's servers 
          crashed and they had to go back to using some older one they had from 
          before. Anyhow...</p>
        <p>Now that things are settling down a bit since Luclin, hopefully the 
          news updates will start up again...esp since certain officers that write 
          the posts will be on more...</p>
        <p>Also, one day soon I will be updating the 3D section. I will write 
          a post soon on how to prepare your character to be on it.</p>

        <p>Temple of Veeshan descided to bow down and pay homage to XA yesterday 
          by dropping all Phat loots it had. Here's the list o drops we got (before 
          I had to log anyway =) -</p>
        <p>Plate drops - 2 Arms</p>
        <p>Leather drops - 2 Tunics (Cronuus, Huen), 1 Boots, 1 Arms</p>
        <p>Caster drops - 1 Robe (Saltino), 1 Gloves (Zodiak)</p>
        <p>Chain drops - 1 Legs (Popi)</p>
        <p>I probably missed some because I came late and logged early...but killer 
          day for drops regardless.</p>
        <p>BTW...Check out this link for pics of the new Luclin mage pet models..they 
          are bad ass =).</p>

        <p>Not really a lot goin on guildwise...peeps just grindin mostly tryin 
          to get ready for Luclin's release. A few more peeps made 60 over the 
          last few days...Myself, Melrik, Lenudorm, and I am sure a few I can't 
          think of right now. XA crushed the Plane of Fear fairly hard the other 
          day as well..in about 3-4 hours we cleared nearly 2/3 of the zone and 
          got epic pieces for Trisk and Zodiak. Anyway...just thought I should 
          post something here =). All you peeps better buy Luclin in time =).....I 
          wanna see us crushin some o the new zones in force with no straglers.</p>

        <p>Hey all...XA doin good over the last week. Eddee and Kurak both got 
          thier epics..grats to them =). Not much goin on right now...tryin to 
          let the guild rest a bit and get some grindage done. Keep up the good 
          work and get some levels....life on raids is much easier when we are 
          strong enough to handle the mobs easily. Kareo updated the calander 
          to reflect kal's listing for guild events. We hit ToV last night...was 
          kinda weak but still we got a few good drops. -</p>
        <p>- 2 caster gloves (kryo, Skymana)</p>
        <p>- 1 Plate bracer (kalatarain)</p>
        <p>- 1 Leather legs (Heeman)</p>
        <p>Grats to all who recieved gear =).</p>

        <p>WOOOOOOOT!! No more eternal Ragefire camp, at around 5:00 pst Graivus 
          got the last piece for his rez noodle. No clue what X is up to now since 
          we had no definate plans, but most likely we'll hit something after 
          such a long down time. C'yas all ingame =).</p>

        <p>Been a quiet few days because of the eternal Ragefire camp. We finally 
          got rage to spawn =)... Grats Kalatarain on his noodle =). XA is hangin 
          around for a second spawn so Graivus can have his noodle as well. Please 
          hang out and help XA hold the camp if at all possible, it sucks I know 
          but is very important for future XA raids. Anyway thats about it..we 
          are on hold till the Ragefire campin is over, hopefully the second spawn 
          wont take too long.</p>

        <p>XA hit Temple of Veeshan (ToV) for the first time yesterday and it 
          went very well. Quite a few drops and no wipe outs at all. Very impressive 
          for our first attemp there, you should all be proud of the acomplishment. 
          Here is a list of the quest pieces dropped:</p>
        <p>- Chain BP (marajayd), 3 Chain gloves, Chain cap</p>
        <p>- Caster cap, Caster gloves, Caster shoes</p>
        <p>- Leather gloves</p>
        <p>Not a bad haul for our first outting, especially considering we never 
          got inside far enough to pull a named mob. We will be hitting ToV again 
          tonight looking for drops and hopefully getting the pulling down well 
          enough to make it to a named mob =). </p>
        <p>Trakanon kill for Eddee's epic will be sunday at 7:00 pm PST, please 
          try to be there if you can make it. Last attempt we did extremely well 
          considering how messed up the spawn was. Lets get our bards on the way 
          to lookin spiffy with thier lil music notes. Dare I say Eddee might 
          actually learn to twist now that he won't have to switch instruments 
          =)...heh</p>
        <p>P.S. Just thought about this one. I wanna post what we as officers 
          have decided to do for high end loot on raids just so you guys know. 
          This is not set in stone, it is just something we are trying just to 
          see how it works as the way we are currently doing it ( random all), 
          is just not working out fair for the guys who show up for every raid 
          and are continually getting screwed. We ahve decided to move really 
          high end loots (BP, Legs, insane items n such..) to a handed out item. 
          The decision is not going to be an arbitrary one but based on the best 
          interest of the guild. Such as decking out Smee over the last week, 
          he is our only level 60 tank and it is absolutely neccissary for him 
          to be able to survive as his job of holding aggro on the uber mobs. 
          We will not be handing out all the items, just the major ones. Regular 
          loot such as arms. gloves, shoes n such will still be randomed like 
          always, so don't feel as though you will never get anything from one 
          of our raids. You just have to prove you deserve one of the major ones 
          if they drop by showing up and supporting the guild in as many of its 
          raids as you can. </p>
        <p>Feel free to post any thoughts on this to the forums, we do want to 
          know how you guys feel about issues such as these since they directly 
          affect you. Anyway, I personally feel this is for the bast and hope 
          you do to.</p>

        <p> Yesterday was a blast.....we killed anything that moved basically. 
          Here is the rundown of what the guild was up to. We started off the 
          day by blowing away Phinny n his watery friends in hopes of either mage 
          or wiz epic pieces. He bent us over and only dropped 2 shammy rods and 
          a chanter rod....both of which I would'nt use as kindling to warm my 
          gnomish buns if I were cold. Feeling cocky we strolled over to skyfire 
          to bumb off a bigger target named Talendar. We did have a bit of trouble 
          with this freak of nature because of his nasty AE fear but we came together 
          and on the third attemp dropped him in the dirt. Great loot from this 
          guy...Cloak of Flames (smee), McVaxius' Horn of War (damasque), Torbin's 
          Eyepatch (kurak), and a number of level 60 spells. Since we died a few 
          times while dispatching the overgrown flamethrower, I happened to notice 
          the real Venril Sathir was up again in karnors. Naturally we could'nt 
          let this scaley heratic live while we knew about it, so promptly we 
          relocated to Karnors and bumped him off with no problems at all. Smee 
          did an exellent job of holding agro once again, while the guild slaughtered 
          Venril. Phats dropped once again...no wiz epic piece unfortunately, 
          but he did drop the Tolan's Darkwood Greaves (Aarid) and the Singing 
          Steel Greaves (Damasque). Feeling that Hubbe had been harshed for too 
          long with no epic....we stroled over to Kithicor and whacked the General 
          down with no problems..Hubbe is the proud owner of a new pig sticker 
          today.grats =). The day was capped off by a few groups trashing the 
          hole for the last hard part of Saltino's chanter epic, all he needs 
          now is the giant (Cazel) in Oasis of Marr. Please keep an eye out for 
          him if you can so we can have another snake in the guild. Great day....keep 
          it up guys. </p>
        <p>XA is goin for our first attempt at Trakanon tonight.....please show 
          if at all possible, we need as many as we can get for this.</p>
        <p>P.S. I almost forgot. Night before last we killed Venril Sathir for 
          the first time and actually finished Darkvisions wizard epic...great 
          accomplishment for the guild as he has been working on his epic for 
          a very long time. Cobalt Greaves also dropped (smee). =)</p>

        <p>For all you out there who enjoy the 3D site, and for those of you who 
          have not been able to see it, there is good news! Flatland has released 
          its new version of rover (3.0). This version IS compatible with IE 6.x, 
          so everyone should now be able to see the 3D site OK. So far it seems 
          more stable too...</p>
        <p>You can get it by going to <a href="http://www.flatland.com" target="_blank">www.flatland.com</a> 
          and clicking downloads on the left hand menu..</p>

        <p>Last few days have been pretty much constant hate raiding. Quite a 
          few good pieces from first and second floor. As far as I know we are 
          still planning on hitting Ixblat fir in burning woods tonight for our 
          clerics. We need the whole guilds participation for this one so we can 
          kill him multiple times. Get with kalatarain or one of the officers 
          online today for more details. Ixblat is basically a pumped up version 
          Lord Rak Ashiir in CoM that you have to kill for shammy epic in that 
          he has a really nasty AE fire proc and mage fire pets are an absolute 
          neccesity. Please come and support the guild so we can have more than 
          one rez noodle for our raids =).</p>

        <p align="left">Yes you read that right, we rocked him hard. Loads of 
          fun. We had 42 peeps (all XA), when all was said and done 22 peeps left 
          standing around to see the carnage. Not bad in my opinion for our first 
          God kill. Now that we are officially badass enough blow away gods we 
          are gonna have to try others and make them raid objectives more often. 
          Inny dropped the ranger epic stone (melrik looted for aarid, hats off 
          to him on the classy move), and 4 class specific items....the gnome 
          ring (wyil won), wood elf bracer (mokas won), troll belt (kurak was 
          imported from mainland to loot it), and unfortunately the dark elf mask 
          rotted because we did'nt get grimwolf up fast enough. Absolutely great 
          job by all involved in making this kill happen, was one of the more 
          memorable moments I have had in EQ for quite some time.</p>

          currently. The hot spot's been Chardok, with the new patch its dropping 
          nice melee gear and more spawns for some phat experience in the deeper 
          areas. Its been a great week of XP seeking, bringing the alliance together

          to be taking advantage of that which is nice, we need the base levels 
          of most of the guild as near 60 as possible to make our lives easier 
          =). If you have'nt already you really ought to check out chardok. Traylor 
          is GOD!!!! The entire zone has been completely revamped making it a 
          much better zone in my oppinion. Especially where xp grindage is concerned. 
          We will still be doing small pop up kills such as the scout and other 
          mobs but no major raids which would cut into our grindage time.</p>

        <p>Night of the Arena Wars!!!!! Exiled Alliance showed up to the Arena 
          ready for a battle within the guild and war ensued. First off we had 
          Class Wars, where Warriors, as a class, fought the other classes in 
          a free for all style team event. The Warriors Came out the champions 
          of the event. Congrats to our Warrior contingent who came and showed 
          whos who in the Arena! Next we had a guild free for all, all enter no 
          one lives but one! That one that did overcome all odds to stand alone 
          in the end was a Shaman with his Epic, Mclaren Efwon. Congrats Mclaren: 
          you are the First Exiled Alliance free for all Champion. Later that 
          eve we had individual duels which lasted to the wee hours of the night. 
          All in all, tons of fun pvp style. We will for sure run another Arena 
          War.</p>

        <p>Hey all, long time no post =). I have been busy the last few weeks 
          with my comp crashing and helping Eldyr move in RL. But all is well, 
          and I shall resume my post as gnome extraordinair =), heh. Me and Kareo 
          updated the Events calander to coincide with Kalatarain's post for hell 
          month. Go check it out n get back to me if you know what exactly trimming 
          is =). I'll find out from Kala sometime tonight and let you all know. 
          Anyway, just grindage for the last few days, hopefully you guys are 
          taking advantage of it and getting just that much closer to 60.</p>

        <p>Confirmed, Sunday night we are going to take a break from normal EQ 
          life and hit the Arena for some PK action. Not mandatory, but it'll 
          be fun. Hit the south side of Kael the other night with some success, 
          only a few kills, but these were level 60 mobs and dropped 4 pieces 
          off 3 mobs. Not bad ehh? Tworiver got the robe which will make CR a 
          breeeze as it gives us a mana free corpse summon, and I applaud the 
          other casters who decided to give the robe to Tworiver as it would help 
          our guild, very classy move. </p>

          hittin Kael, building our faction, getting some nice drops. Some of 
          us are all the way to ally with the dragons, and some of us are close. 
          We will soon be ready to hit named mobs in WW, and also in the ToV very 
          easily so keep workin it, we are almost there. Also, we will be making 
          it a habit to knock off the Kromzek Captain in WW as much as possible

          high enough to take out almost any zone/mob, and we will be testing 
          that in the next few weeks when we hit Trakanon, Faydedar, Gorenaire 
          and anything else we can think of. ( maybe Innorruk if we have a lot 
          of people willing to try it). Also on sunday we will probably be going 
          to the arena for those who would like to go, just for fun, but this

          alliance. Wonko , of the druid sect, found it necessary to bind himself 
          in the kael arena by the spawn point of one of the giants. Of course, 
          when he died elsewhere, he ended up in his bind spot...only to be confronted 
          by that giant who was none too pleased to see a druid in his own castle. 
          Needless to say Wonko was caught in the deathloop. The Alliance gathered 
          and killed the giant to save poor Wonko. Have a nice day..</font></p>

          time to panic, and as i was doing my usually sulky activities, i was 
          to find out there was one place that would rescue me from this disaster.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">now i find that 
          recently people have been commenting on the guild, and not all of it 
          is bad, most is good, i find that the next part of my story defines 
          what a guild is really about, and where ya friends really are....</font></p>

          my corpse. now i didnt have to convince everyone to do this, in fact 
          i didnt mention anything in guildsay to do this, it was just hte fact 
          that i needed help, and without asking, XA came to the rescue.</font></p>

        <P>At about 3:00 pst Zordak Ragefire finally spawned.......putting an 
          end to the fiery hell known as camp-sucks-a-lot. Huge grats go out to 
          Strangg for being the first XA Cleric to get his rez noodle!! Thanks 
          to all who helped out on this long camp. Along with the heart that strangg 
          needed for his quest 2 Treasure Hunter bags and a Red Dragon scale were 
          also dropped. The Treasure Hunter Bags were traded to the monks for 
          thier tinkered bags.....and the tinkered bags were lotto'd. The Red 
          Dragon Scale was held by Kalatarain untill we get a warrior far enough 
          along that it can be used for epic. Great day for XA .....we have been 
          trying to get a cleric thier epic for some time now, it will be a huge 
          boon to the uild on raids when things go wrong in the future =).</P>

        <P>It's been 2 days since the patch, and Strangg and company are still 
          goin strong in Sol B waiting for Ragefire to pop so we can kick his 
          arse and get Runt a rez noodle. We will be farming the entire zone to 
          kill time, and Naggy's Lair is an unusual but very well laid out spot 
          for duels so bring it on! Everyone that is available to hang here, this 
          is a great chance for a lil grindage which we don't see much of with 
          all the raids we usually slap together. Bring yer coffee/soda/beer/bong 
          (for Bob) and whatever else you need to stay on as long as it fookin 
          takes to get this done. </P>

        <P>Not much happened yesterday but XP grindage...but grindage is good 
          =)</P>
        <P>Plenty of stuff happenin the night before however. I wasn't on...but 
          our guild ripped hate a new one anyway =). Lots o' drops on the first 
          floor inlcluding -</P>
        <P>-Epic piece off the revenants for Vitki </P>
        <P>-Quite a few various drops of armor from 1st and second floor</P>
        <P>Grats to all who recieved something from raid.</P>
        <P>Good stuff all around. Just to let you guys know...I am going to be 
          updating the news site here from now on. I am working with Kareo to 
          add a section on epic weapons that will include a complete walkthrough 
          for all classes and a list of the members we have and thier progress. 
          Hopefully this will help and encourage all the guildies to work on thier 
          epics and be an easy way for us to track them. Although a few epics 
          obviously hold priority such as Cleric and Chanter because of how much 
          they benefit the guild as a whole. I am a firm believer that EVERY member 
          of the guild should be actively working on thier epics and have the 
          guild support to do so. The more able to deal and recieve damage as 
          the individuals we are, the better the guild will act as a whole on 
          raids. </P>
        <P>Anyway, the webpage is coming along nicely now and I think is starting 
          to be usable as more than just a nifty thing to look at.</P>

        <P>on 08/11/01 Cronuus posted the following on the forum:</P>
        <P><FONT size=2>Epic- 2 Mobs left<BR>
          --------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
          I'm at the point in my epic where I need only 2 more mobs to finish 
          it, these are the corrupted Seahorse in Kedge keep who spawns around 
          estrella area, and Faydedar, who is triggered or 1 week spawn in Timorus 
          deep.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT size=2>Next i am going to go after the seahorse but i need help 
          from 1 or 2 groups, we can head into kedge and kill PHs for undertow, 
          which mages need for their epic, also drops a 50mana shoulder item for 
          int casters, kill the PH for estrella which drops a 8wis shoulder item 
          for wis casters and PH for Tainted seahorse, once tainted seahorse is 
          killed the corrupted one will spawn in its place instantly and that 
          is the mob that i need, while down there we can get uween's seahorse 
          at the same time. once finished with this part all i will need is Faydedar 
          in timorus deep which i can make spawn at any time if the NPC to trigger 
          him is up, he is a 5 hour spawn so me and uween cant both do him at 
          the same time, but in the same day if we still have the numbers online 
          after killing the first one. I am not sure how many are required for 
          faydedar but im guessing about 24-36 people can do it, need high fire 
          and magic resists and an instant cast buff item also helps alot ( Jboots, 
          goblin earing, bracer of the hidden ). <BR>
          <BR>
          </FONT>Keep this in mind. Maybe we can help him make plans if it doesn't 
          fall together on its own. If you have a reply post it to the forum at:

        <P>We had a small raid on Kael Drakkal, congrats to Aarid and Skyjulin 
          on yer phat quest armor. Drops were a little light but it was still 
          fun, and surprisingly had a good turnout despite the short notice. If 
          nothing else at least we were able to witness the Kamakazi style pulling 
          of Kalatarain and Eddee, and the little known but effective " Ranger 
          Gate" to prevent any adds on pulls. We shall be going back soon so no 
          worries if ya missed the action.<BR>
          <BR>
          Tonight we will be raiding Akanon to get gnome meat so Mclaren can bake 
          us some gnome-kabobs.<BR>
          <BR>
          Peace<BR>
