			Guardians of Wisdom has a strict set of rules that the officers have set forth for all to follow. The rules stated below are not the only ones that members should follow. There are also "common sense" rules of be courteous, mature, and respectful etc.
			<BLOCKQUOTE><BR>1) No kill stealing, unless the situation calls for a decision of an officer.
			<BR>2) No intentionaly training anyone EVER.
			<BR>3) Regular guild events will be held weekly and you are required to go to guild events at least twice a month. If you miss any meeting a penance will be due to the guild based on player level and past infractions (if any).
			<BR>4) Share what you have extra with the guild, if you are selling or trading please offer to sell or trade to a guild member first.
			<BR>5) Donations are to be given to the guild treasurer at each meeting for guild expenses.
			<BR>6) If any guild member calls for aid (recovering corpses etc.) the guild will do the best it can to help.</BLOCKQUOTE>
			Keeping Guardians of Wisdom the greatest it can be is not an easy task. It is unavoidable that there will be times where members need to be removed for the benefit of the guild. Although this reduces the family by a few members, it does make the guild that much stronger. Again this is up to the officer's judgment whether a member is considered Guardians of Wisdom material. To keep our quality of membership the following rules apply to recruitment.
			<BLOCKQUOTE><BR>1) Anyone under level 25 will NOT be recruited UNLESS they are "Real Life" Friends, or Relatives. This will keep the "tight" feeling in Guardians of Wisdom.
			<BR>2) People OVER level 25 we may recruit only AFTER a guild officer has spoken with them, interviewed them, and played with them. They must have at least TWO sponsors and have played with us for a minimum of two weeks
			<BR>3) Every person can have only 1 char under lvl 25 in the guild at a time, 2 chars lvl 26-35, 3 chars lvl 36-45,and unlimited chars above lvl 45. Secondary characters will be allowed in the guild at level 15. This is to help keep from getting flooded with low level twinks and forgotten characters. If you need to change who is your primary character please contact Windrunner or TikaTika via email with your request.</BLOCKQUOTE>
			The rules are simple. The guidelines are straight forward. And we will detail them a little more before we are finished. We appreciate all of you, and we appreciate your enforcing these rules with your fellow guild members. Thank you all very much.
			<BR><BR><B>The Point System</B>
			<BR>We want to reward all of our members for participating in the guild.  To that end, we have instituted a points system.  It goes hand in hand with our titles.  After you get an appropriate amount of points, you will be rewarded with your new title and an evening of adventure devoted to you.  Below are listed the titles and points required for each, and below that are the actions which earn you points.  Everyone starts off at Lector.  Upon reaching each level your point total will be returned to 0.  This means for each new title it will take a little more effort.  Most of the actions that earn you points are worth 10 or 20 points.  this means that to move up to the Scholar level you only need do 10 to 20 things to earn points.  Thanks to everyone for their input.
