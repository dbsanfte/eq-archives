      with the Order, and units those that are secluded from the Divine Light.</p>
    <p><font color="#FF3333">Trauwn</font>- The office of Treasurer. Trauwn is 
      resonsible for collecting revenues from current guild members as well as

      new initiates in the order. This officer will assign a mentor, catalog the 
      initiates information, and see to that all of the initiats questions are

      that the Order repeats itself the Glace S'arne gather's up the most open 
      minds and creates the Order. The founder's that accept the idea's of the

      laws and oversee all ceremonies. </p>

      and members wishing to prove themselves to the guild.</p>
