<p><font color="#FFCC33" face="Merlin">There are 8 islands/rock collections that 
  are visible from the ship. I will start at the Freeport side and describe what 
  I found moving towards Butcherblock mtns. Note while documented elsewhere, it 
  was still a bit interesting that while we think of the continent of Feydwer 
  being to the east of Antonica, this is incorrect based on the sense direction 
  skill used during the trip, it appears that in the Ocean of Tears, Feydwer is 
  to the west of Antonica. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFCC33" face="Merlin">Now on to the islands, </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFCC33" face="Merlin">Sisterhood Island, first island to the 
  north: This island is filled with female warriors who /con red to me, and would 
  not talk to me either, from what I have read about the island there isn't much 
  here of interest, except that the ship stops here, so it's important for people 
  who fall off the boat. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFCC33" face="Merlin">Isle of K'Arnon: first isle to south: This 
  island was populated by sea goblins who /con green to me. I have read that there 
  is an oracle on the island, but I missed talking to him. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFCC33" face="Merlin">Gray Isle: second isle to south: I didn't 
  see anyone on this isle, but then again at this point in time I was running 
  quickly between sides of the boat. In addition I can find no writing talking 
  about it. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFCC33" face="Merlin">Mudtoe Isle: second isle to north: On this 
  isle I saw a single NPC called Boog Mudtoe who /con black, and non-agressive 
  to me. I have read that there is a merchant selling magic scrolls on the island 
  (I don't know what class the scrolls were for) </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFCC33" face="Merlin">Pirate Isle: third isle to north: On this 
  isle there are various red aggressive people and monsters, the two I saw were 
  Gornt Giant and Capt. Surestout. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFCC33" face="Merlin">Twin Tines: (also called the peaks Cyrith 
  and Gorgor by a fellow traveler) the twin rock croppings in the middle of the 
  journey: These rocks had various Alluring Sirens on them who /con blue aggressive 
  </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFCC33" face="Merlin">Zachariah Isle: the last isle on south: 
  This island has various NPCs who /con red to me. The only one who would have 
  anything to do with me was the innkeeper, who would sell me food, water, etc. 
  Some other things of interest are some runes on the island, and that this is 
  another stop for the boat, so important for people who jump off the boat. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFCC33" face="Merlin">Siren Rocks: the collections of rocks at 
  the end of the zone near Butcherblock: These rocks had numerous green Aqua Goblins 
  and blue Alluring Sirens. </font></p>
