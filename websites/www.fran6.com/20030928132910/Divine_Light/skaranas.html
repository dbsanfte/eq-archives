<p align="center"><font size="6" face="Merlin" color="#FFCC00">South Karanas </font></p>
<p> <font face="Merlin">This is an addendum to let travellers be aware of the 
  dangers to avoid and the allies that exist. </font></p>
<p><font face="Merlin" color="#FF3333">Splitpaw Straightforward gnoll dungeon</font><font face="Merlin">. 
  The gnolls are slightly weaker than those at Black Burrow, however they are 
  better dressed. It is not very crowded (hence few trains) and the loot is fairly 
  good. Recommend the first level to characters of 8th level and up (in a group 
  of course) </font></p>
<p><font face="Merlin" color="#FF3333">Brother Nash</font><font face="Merlin"> 
  He appears to be the same as the other splitpaw gnolls, however he speaks of 
  worshipping Rodcet Nife, and when conned viewed indifferently. I would suggest 
  letting this peaceful creature be. </font></p>
<p><font face="Merlin" color="#FF3333">Undead Pyramid</font><font face="Merlin"> 
  Populated by skeletons and zombies. I didn't get close enough to see if there's 
  an entrnce to the pyramid. </font></p>
<p><font face="Merlin" color="#FF3333">Vhalen Nostrolo</font><font face="Merlin"> 
  A friendly but sad hermit bard resides here by a pool. He has a quest for anyone 
  who's interested. Strangely a gnoll spawns in the pool under the water. </font></p>
<p><font face="Merlin" color="#FF3333">Centaur Village</font><font face="Merlin"> 
  The only one here that will talk to you is the leader Ulan Meadowgreen. The 
  centaurs all regarded me indifferently, and Ulan sold some weapons, foodstuffs, 
  and fletching supplies. Of course he also purchases loot acquired from splitpaw, 
  but don't expect any great deals. </font></p>
<p><font face="Merlin" color="#FF3333">Treants</font><font face="Merlin"> Two 
  magnificent treants spawn here ( I believe them to be mates). Unfortunately 
  there was an evil dark elf party camping the spot and slaying the creatures, 
  and I was powerless to stop it….. </font></p>
<p><font face="Merlin" color="#FF3333">5 Raiders</font><font face="Merlin"> 5 
  Raiders spawn here and "scowl menacingly". Best to avoid them, unless you want 
  a fight. </font></p>
<p><font face="Merlin" color="#FF3333">Undead Ruins</font><font face="Merlin"> 
  Populated by skeletons, and putrid skeletons, lots and lots of them. </font></p>
<p><font face="Merlin" color="#FF3333">Aviak Village</font><font face="Merlin"> 
  A little reminiscent of Kelethin, without the hospitality. The only one who 
  speaks to you is Krak Windchaser, the leader but he refused to sell to me. All 
  aviaks looked "dubiously" at me but none attacked me. In case you're wondering 
  aviaks are hybrid bird-men </font></p>
<p><font face="Merlin">Wandering Creatures South Karanas is populated by a healthy 
  host of <font color="#FF3333">lions</font> and <font color="#FF3333">elephants</font>, 
  the elephants are indifferent, but ive heard rumours that if you start killing 
  them your faction can drop (hmmmmm). The lions are the same as west karanas 
  except no young ones. The centaurs and aviaks both seem to patrol their respective 
  areas, with the odd straggler far from home. </font></p>
<p><font face="Merlin">The biggest thing to watch for are the <font color="#FF3333">cyclops</font>. 
  Either theres two walking around, or it's the fastest creature on two feet. 
  He doesn't appear to have a territory, pretty much the whole of the southern 
  karanas. Lots to see and do here. </font></p>
<p><font face="Merlin">Good hunting and may you leave no trail as you journey. 
  The Father of Storms watches over you….</font></p>
