An example would be a rude person who comes to a camped spawn which has been held by the same group for many hours and demands to be able to share a rare spawn.  An example would be the Lord in Lower Guk.  The way people run groups in most popular dungeons is to hold lists for those groups and allow anyone who wants on the list to be put on it, when an opening comes up they are notified and they can join the group.  The Play Nice Policies totally screw that up, they basically make it so that any other group of folks can show up and demand to cut the spawn in half.  Considering we're talking about something like the Lord, how often does the Lord actually spawn?  Not that often. So what if you have 2 people in your group who need SMRs, and another group comes along and demands to share that means the second time this really rare spawn comes up they get to kill it even though your group has been there longer and has waited longer and may have cleared the spawn.  How is that fair and nice?  The Play Nice Policy allows rude, pushy, and greedy people to abuse GMs to get what they want.</font>

						The PnP is BS...I think that if you were there first, then you should rightfully get it.  My buddy was trying to get a Langseax of the Wolves one night, but another person came by with a guide and forced him to give him the head of the Barbarian he killed....just because of the PnP.  He had been trying to get the rare spawn barbarian(Not basil) And when he finally did, a person who waltzed right up and told a guide he wasnt letting him camp him, got the item, and eventually the LoW.  So I think the PnP Sucks.

						Yeah they shouldn't force rare spawns to be shared because they are too rare.  I remember I tried for my LoW for a LONG time, it would have sucked if I had to share with everyone else after camping it for several hours.  I could see trading off, like each time the dog comes back a different group gives him the shirt.  I have shared it like that before, you just kinda pray that Paglan spawns when it's your turn.  Still sucks because it slims your chances down 50% even less than they already were.  Usually if the other group is nice they also realize that it slims the chances and they decide they would be better off just coming back later when it's not camped.

						There PnP needs some work.  Both examples that have been made illustrate that, however Zeromuus' example is more of how stupid some of the GMs are and can be.  Since when did play nice mean to roll over and give everything you have to any punk that comes along?  They simply should have put a little more thought into this.

						I agree completely that the PnP needs alot of work, I had a simlar experience, my group was camped someplace and a small group came in a just started rudely killin our spawn, when we got on and started catching spawn faster one of the players logged and brought another higher char in and started KSing everything that spawned, it was completely rediculous. Can nothing be done about this? It take alot of time and work to break the spawn in a camp and for someone to come along and not ask or anything and throw the PnP up in our faces, needless to say we were all disscusted and ended up leaving. PnP and GMs need a little work.

						And on the ninth day Verant Created PvP and PvP-Teams, and there was much rejoycing. Thanks to their insight Verant has made it so that if you can come to a PvP resultion then the PnP does not apply to the situation where a rotation is necessary. Of course this still leaves ya open to some jerk coming along and trying to take the spawn from ya, if ya win, great, they gotta leave. If ya loose you may have to try and get some friends to help you out, and visa-versa (he can bring in his buddies). It often leads to no one getting anything, or the<p>Of course PnP also covers people being jerks, harassing other groups, and what not. It basically makes it so the Guides can go, "Work out something, or I'll work it out for ya." I mean before the PnP someone could come along and take over a room and there wasn't a lot guides could do to stop it unless they were kill stealing, and most bullies were smart enough to just sit on the spawn point and bully the other group out of the area.<p>Here's something else to think of, all these people who got Kills Stolen from them probably had it happen at a busy time when the guides were having a hard time keeping on top of the petitions, or the person didn't petition fast enough to get a guide out. Since the Guides have to witness "incidents" it makes it really hard to catch people unless they are being REAL stupid about it. Of course if you are on a PvP it's usually easier to "work out" the spawn rotation, kill the other group and the spawn is yours.<p>Also, why does everyone call the Guides, GMs? GMs work for Verant there is usually only 1 per server, Guides are people who Volentier for FREE to log in and deal with all the crap that goes on in order to prevent the GMs from getting bombarded with minor squibles so he can work on the major problems like "Scammers", and any of the hundreds of fraud claims that come into his email box on almost a daily basis. Geez, cut em a break, I've never met a Guide who was not understanding, and working his/her butt off in order to help me when I was having real problems like when ya zone into lava or fall off the boat. At least they can do something about that, PnP was put in to encourage players to police themselves, if you have a problem sharing log in at 3am in the morning, chances are no one will be around to care.

						PnP rules are a "quick-fix" solution to the problem's of Everquest's design flaws. I love the game as much as all the other players, but this much is painfully obvious. Players have found ways of manipulating the game in ways Verant had not forseen since launch. They are constantly trying to keep the game playable and fun for all class' and races.<p>Everquest is an online game, and as the basis for online gaming you play, rely on and work with and against other players. Without them, there is no multiplayer aspect to the game. Everyone who plays the game is in it to move further and advance as much as possible. No one walks into the game and says "I'm going to die and lose my corpse today." Everyone wants to help thier character (and friends of course) get further and further. That is the basic concept for the game. Verant has worked out a great system where players are forced to work with others to advance in the game. This keeps the multiplayer aspect alive. This is what Abashi means by "balance", meaning that all class' and races can prosper in the game and rely on others to help them with feats they can't accomplish alone. You play with other people, whether they be jerks or angels, you play WITH them. <p>Verant uses PnP rules to keep players working together rather then against each other. They are a good idea, but can be taken advantage of too easily. I suggest if you can think of a better solution (that Abashi hasn't vetoed already), post it on the Everquest message boards. Maybe your idea will catch on and solve this PnP problem once and for all.<p>Oh yeah, and in reference to the<br>last post, Guides do not work for free, they are paid through free everquest the entire time they guide.<br>

						PnP is a good idea. The only people who don't like it are the selfish ones. When you<br> see the same people camped at the same orc camp for 5 hours and then you get<br> harrassed by them for basically just wanting your turn it sucks. I think that if people would<br> share more and complain less then you wouldn't have to have a policed <br>environment enforcing you to play nice. Not one person who is playing has paid <br>any less money for the game but for some reason people feel they in their almighty<br> superiority complex imbedded in their id and superego that they should have <br>TOTAL control of a shared environment.<p>Plainly put you people that are complaining about it are THE reason it was enacted<br>in the first place

						What entitles you to your turn? Hmmm?  I remember when my group was covering the Derv camp in the West Commons, (the big camp with the really quick spawn time).  We had just finished clearing out when another group comes along and thinks, hey we want our turn, of course they didn't ask, didn't say a WORD to us, not that it would have mattered, this was late at night and there were lots of other places for them to go hunt.  Anyways, what makes it worse is that this group isn't high enough in levels to really be taking the camp, but they go right into the middle of the camp and decide to steal the camp, well lets just say that our previous fight had brought the spawns rather close together, and the resulting massacre was interesting.  I was the only one in my group to witness this, as two of them once they engaged the first Derv took off to go bank, and another one went AFK to get a snack.  I think that group could have taken the camp, if two derv thugs hadn't spawned.  The only time I have a problem with people camping a spawn is if it has a special item that they don't need, and is below there level, becuase this robs other players the chance to go and get the item themselves (self quest in a way).  Best example is the PGT, I hate it when lv 30+ people are there camping him, especialy when they are casters, he sure doesn't need it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know there are people that will disagree with me on that, they think people have a right to farm items.  My point is this why should someone else have the right to just come and take your camp from you just because they don't want to go to another.  If you can prove that that camp is necasary for you, and that for some strange reason all other spawns in the game don't give you exp, or something, fine I'll concede by why the heck should I just roll over and say here, take my spawn, its not like I waited for the previous group to leave, especially if I'm camping some rare spawn legitimatly (ex.  lv 40 SK wanting a FBSS, who has never had one, compared to some lv 50+ wizard who just wants to make some bank.)  My point, if you want your turn, wait for it like everyone else.  About the camping it for 5 hours, that is most likely all 5 hours I would be able to play for the week, so what makes you think your playing time is more valuable then mine, especially when I have alot less.  When I say you, is it directed at all those people that think they should have the right to EVERY spawn in the game and can just come in and take over a spawn.

						I don't think i ever mentioned that it was ok to<br>ks or just go in and take over a camp. but obviously when there is a group with a free slot and you ask to be included and they reply with a<br>BS line like it will mess up our exp ratio and loot split then that sucks. And to get harrassed for ASKING is what i am talking about. or even ignored most of the time. And what makes you think You DESERVE 5 hours of camping the same camp when there are many people waiting for the extremely rare opportunity to earn their own stuff for quests and whatnot but usually just end up paying selfish a**'s like you who won't let them share , mind you i say SHARE not STEAL. And a spawn will actually go faster if you have 2 groups at a camp.

						Allright, while I don't usually think it's right for a group to waltz into a a rare spawn at a dungeon and demand "their fair share" on a spawn.  Something happened to my guild recently that had me reflectnig on PnP.  <p>My guild decided to take a trip into Dalnir, with our upper 30s group.  After all, maybe we could get a robe of the Foci, for the guild's Enchanter.  It was not to be so.  We entered, to find the Foci spawn camped by a level 54 Necromancer in a SMR.  (heh)  We realize that the penkeeper spawns very rarely.  He announced that he was there to get himself a BC robe to sell and was not about to give up his spawn anytime soon, as he had been camping this spawn for 15+ hours and no spawn yet..  if the Penkeeper spawned with a Foci Robe ( an enchanter only robe), what might we have to TRADE for it?  Yes, trade.  The guy wouldn't even let us share the placeholders.  He was going to kill every single placeholder there until he got what he wanted.  Oh, well... maybe once he farms the heck out of the dungeon of Dalnir...  The people who would actually get EXP for the stuff will be allowed to try their hand too.  Right now, it's as silly as the thought of my own guild of 30s and 40s doing to Blackburrow to camp the gnoll commander room.  Until the farmer leaves,  off we go to Frontier Mountains, where stuff roams freely.  No sense whining to a GM about this stupid thing.  I figure, we can make much better use of our time by getting levels and faction.  I can very well guess why EQ farmers don't like the PnP.  Less cash inflowing?  Less items to sell on Ebay?  I promptly placed the guy's name onto my, "Do not Ressurect, EVER" list. <p>And yet, I can't help but feel some pity for the guy.  I started to develop a sad mental picture of him living at his computer behind a wall of popcans and crumpled poato chip bags.  It can't be very much of a life; camping a spawn for 15+ hours...  I figured his only sense of having real accomplishment was to be powerful in the game, while in real life.. all he was going to accomplish would be a severe case of arse spread.  ( .. pass me the Doritos hun, Mmm. -*crunch*.. )
