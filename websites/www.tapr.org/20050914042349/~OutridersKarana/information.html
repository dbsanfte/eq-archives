<blockquote>
The Outriders of Karana is an eclectic group of players who were
brought together in the pursuit of one thing; fun.  The mission of each
member of this guild is simple: Have fun and attempt to create an enjoyable
environment for your fellow guild members.  Each of us plays in our own
unique way and can bring something different to the proverbial table, some
are excellent role players, others have great skill at slaying beasts, a few
can tell a great story or simply talk your ear off.
<p>
If you look at a guild with the mindset "Its just a guild" its not much.
However if you look at a guild as a group of your good friends and extended
family you will enjoy your playing experience more.  Friends, trust and fun
are worth far more then any item, title or level.

adventure, whom we can trust in the depths of a dungeon or wherever." --
