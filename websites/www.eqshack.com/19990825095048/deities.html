                    he is their father, much to the disgust of the Dwarves of 
                    Kaladim who know that the Dwarves are the true children of 
                    Serilis. But the vicious Gnolls of Split Paw disagree entirely. 
                    For was it not Brell who sculpted them out of the sacred Clay 
                    of Cosgrove? Followers of Brell Serilis in one form or another

                    as the Kedge. </td>

                    care about. The peace they seek is an inner one. They wish 
                    to know all there is to know about themselves and the world 
                    around them. They thirst for knowledge of their true selves

                    the sharing of this knowledge that they believe universal 
                    peace can be obtained. If every creature fully understood 
                    itself and its neighbors there would be no need for conflict 
                    and war. Followers of Quellious often follow a nomadic lifestyle, 
                    constantly seeking what there is to know and hoping to find 
                    themselves along the way. </td>
