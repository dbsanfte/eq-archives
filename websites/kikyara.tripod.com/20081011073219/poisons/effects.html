<h1>Poisoning Effects</h1>
<br>
<br>
The effect of poisoning covers 16 different areas that repeat and upgrade to five tiers.
I decided to follow Quip Quarrels example here and present the effects collected on a
page (with links to the related poisons). The original information is from Vaslin's EqCaster.
I will put additional tactical considerations into that document as soon as I discover some
on the safehouse or my boards.
<br>
<br>
The Level information is related to the level of the one who made the poison. As known, a
poisons strengh increases with the makers level.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<ul>

<font size="+2"><b><a name="berserker">Berserker Madness</a></b></font>
<br>
<br>
In Berserker Madness is a trade-off poison that is considered among many rogues as
&quot;useless&quot;. The poisoned victim suffers a quit large damage over time, but
experiences also a greater rush of adrenaline that increases strengh and armor rating.
<br><br>
Anyway, it is quite useful for several things:
<ul>
    <li>Attacking casters
    <li>Killing weaker caster pets
    <li>Training poison making
    <li>Kiting
</ul><br>
The exact effects are:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td valign=top><b>Tier I</b></td>
        <td valign=top>
        Increasing STR by 6 (Lvl 1) to 47 (Lvl 42)<br>
        Increasing AC by 0 (Lvl 1) to 6 (Lvl 42)<br>
        DD for 11 (Lvl1) to 52 (Lvl 42)<br>
        DoT for 30 (Lvl1) to 235 (Lvl 42)<br>
        The effect lasts for 30 seconds.

         DoT for 155 (Lvl1) to 425 (Lvl 55)<br>

         DD for 11 (Lvl1) to 70 (Lvl 60)<br>
         DoT for 305 (Lvl1) to 600 (Lvl 60)<br>
         The effect lasts for 30 seconds.

<font size="+2"><b><a name="blind">Blind Poison</a></b></font>
<br>
<br>
That one is one of my favorites. It is incredibly useful because of its long duration.
That makes that poison valuable for beasts as a &quot;poor mans blind&quot; as well
as for PvP. Anyway, dont use that in dungeons or your prey will bring his friends.
Use it for:
<br><br>
<ul>
    <li>Blinding your PvP opponent
    <li>Make beast run off.
</ul><br>
The exact effects are:

<table>
    <tr>
         <td valign=top><b>Tier I</b></td>
         <td valign=top>
         Decreasing ATK by 5<br>
         Blind<br>
         The effect lasts for 42 seconds.
         </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
         <td valign=top><b>Tier II</b></td>
         <td valign=top>
         Decreasing ATK by 5<br>
         Blind<br>
         The effect lasts for 72 seconds.

    </tr>
    <tr>
         <td valign=top><b>Tier III</b></td>
         <td valign=top>
         Decreasing ATK by 5<br>
         Blind<br>
         The effect lasts for 102 seconds.

<font size="+2"><b><a name="brittle">Brittle Haste</a></b></font>
<br>
<br>
Another trade-off serie of poisons. The weakening effect is greatly reduced by a
haste effect where the beast damages slower but mor often than before. Personally
I do not like that very much.
<br><br>
Use it for:
<ul>
    <li>Train poison making.
    <li>Debuffing already weak beasts for training defense.
    <li>Debuffing already weak beasts when the increased speed is gulped by the inability to make damage.
</ul><br>
The exact effects are:

<table>
    <tr>
         <td valign=top><b>Tier I</b></td>
         <td valign=top>
         Increased Attack speed by 10%<br>

<font size="+2"><b><a name="contact">Contact</a></b></font>
<br>
<br>
Contact is a nice and direct DD serie. General useful.
<br><br>
Use it:
<ul>
    <li>as quick opening move
    <li>for PvP opening damage
    <li>for group support

<br>
<br>

<font size="+2"><b><a name="dizzy">Dizzy</a></b></font>
<br>
<br>
Dizzy makes the opponents more vulnerable to your attacks. It also reduces the
armor class of the opponent a bit. All in all I would say it is not very useful. 
Reducing agility is closely pointless, it just makes the prey run off earlyer and 
it is slightly better to hit and when a prey has 1000AC a reduction by 21 is 
pointless too.
<br><br>
Use it for:
<ul>
    <li>Training purpose
</ul><br>
The exact effects are:

         <td valign=top><b>Tier I</b></td>

Is also one of the very plain poisons. It simply drains a lot of mana from your
opponent. That effect is useless agains NPC's with their closely eternal mana,
but it is a real nasty surprise for every caster in PvP. *grins evilly*

Use it for:

<font size="+2"><b><a name="flesh">Flesh Rot</a></b></font>
<br>
<br>
That is a real nice combination poison from Kaxxon's beauty tips. It makes the flesh
rot on the living opponent and causes great pain and suffering. Especially it is
useful for tough meele opponents, reducing their dex and make them suffer some damage
over time as well. It makes a fighter in PvP feel quite safe while slowly draining
the life away. Also valuable is the fact, that the DoT is fixed and does not change with
the level of the maker - that makes it as a hard hitting but sneaking poison for young
poisoners in longer fights.
<br><br>
Use it for:
<ul>
    <li>Pvp combat vs. meele classes
    <li>Support poison for tough meele opponents
    <li>As DoT when you are quite new to poison making
    <li>When you expect a longer fight
</ul><br>
The exact effects are:

    <li>In combo with the blind serie: stab, stab, stab
    <li>Nice in Pvp, especially the combo with blind

Oh boy that one is fine. It does a root and reduces the attack speed of the
opponent. Don't miss the combo with blind. The beast is rooted first and then gets a
hit with the blinding poison. Now the prey is unable to attack anymore and will take
one stab after the other. Also it is the ultimate soloing poison.

    <li>PvP - use the combo!

    <li>Soloing

That poison is quite useful when you are used to it and face a casting opponent.
It pushes the target back, inflicts some nice direct damage and does a VERY short stun.
That usually interrupts all casting and gives you the opportunity to land another safe
blow. It should be considered as a Contact-series poison with disturbing side effect.
Use Contact for DD only, and this one against casters. Watch the casters hands and jump in
when they start to glow. Anyway, IMHO only the DD is useful.
<br><br>
Use it for:
<ul>
    <li>Push an opponent over the cliff
    <li>General useful for the direct damage
</ul><br>
