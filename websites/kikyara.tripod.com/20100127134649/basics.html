<h1>Poison Basics</h1>
<br>
<br>
First of all a big thanks to all rogues who did a great job to figure out
all that great details about poisoning. The list of all would be too long
to compile but I have at least to mention Quip Quarrel and his excellent
&quot;Unofficial Tome of Poison Mastery&quot; and Zato with his &quot;Official
Tome of Poison Mastery&quot;, many informations are also taken from
<a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse">The Safehouse</a> and
<a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/poison">EQ Casters Realm</a>. A big cheer
to all rogues who made that site possible.<br>
<br>
We will only discuss the howto and some details at this page. You can find the
reciptes, ingredient list and other necessary information elsewhere on that site.<br>
<br>
Poisons are a tactical boost to rogues. They are a quite expensive utility
to boost the chances of a rogue to kill his opponent. This is also one of the
most complicated systems in Everquest and it gave generations of rogues a
severe headache. <br>
<br>
<br>

<b>Effects</b><br>
<br>
<br>
The effects vary from simply direct damage, damage over time to snare, blind
or weaken. There are 16 different effects:

<ul>
   <li><b><a href="poisons/effects.html#berserker">Berserker Madness</a></b>
   <li><b><a href="poisons/effects.html#blind">Blind Poison</a></b>
   <li><b><a href="poisons/effects.html#brittle">Brittle Haste</a></b>
   <li><b><a href="poisons/effects.html#contact">Contact</a></b>
   <li><b><a href="poisons/effects.html#dizzy">Dizzy</a></b>
   <li><b><a href="poisons/effects.html#feeble">Feeble Mind</a></b>
   <li><b><a href="poisons/effects.html#flesh">Flesh Rot</a></b>
   <li><b><a href="poisons/effects.html#injected">Injected</a></b>
   <li><b><a href="poisons/effects.html#liquid">Liquid Silver</a></b>
   <li><b><a href="poisons/effects.html#lower">Lower Resist</a></b>
   <li><b><a href="poisons/effects.html#muscle">Muscle Lock</a></b>
   <li><b><a href="poisons/effects.html#paralyzing">Paralyzing Root</a></b>
   <li><b><a href="poisons/effects.html#animal">Poison Animal</a></b>
   <li><b><a href="poisons/effects.html#summoned">Poison Summoned</a></b>
   <li><b><a href="poisons/effects.html#system">System Shock</a></b>
   <li><b><a href="poisons/effects.html#weaken">Weaken</a></b>
</ul>
All this effects come in upgrades or tiers. A higher tier, means a stronger
effect. Weaken I is much Weaker than Weaken III. What Weaken you will use
depends on the ingredients you have, your money and the prey. Further, the strenght
of a poison is related to the level of the one who applies it (and <b>not</b> on the maker
as I mistakenly stated in a previous version of that document). Let's take weaken as example and try
to analyze the effects a bit:<br>
<br>
<ul>
    Weaken I (= Weaken Tier 1) is represented by the poisons Spider Venom and
    Regalis poison. That means that <b>they work exactly the same way!</b>.
    When we look at the <a href="poisons/effects.html#weaken">effects page under weaken</a>
    we note that Weaken I has the entry:<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <i>Decreases STR from 2 (Lvl 1) to 34 (Lvl 33)<br>
        The duration of the effect is 1 tick (6 seconds) per level</i><br>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Let's assume, we are a rogue at Level 24. At Level 1 our poison would decrease
    the strengh of the beast by onl 2 points - that's pretty weak - but 34 on
    Level 33. The poison tops at Level 33 and when you reach level 50, that poison will
    still reduce the strengh for 34 points. At our actual level (24) the strengh decrease
    should be around 25 (level+1 for THIS poison). Also, the duration that decrease lasts
    will be exactly 144 seconds (24 ticks * 6 seconds each tick).<br>
    <br>
    If we would be at a higher level than 33, it would make sense to use one of the upgrades
    to that poison, namely Athropic Sap (Weaken II) which tops at Level 42 or Monk's Hood Aconite
    (Weaken III) which tops at Level 53. It does not make sense to make the more expensive
    Weaken II or III at level 24, because only the top moves but the poison itself will not
    produce a stronger effect in the upgrade. Anyway, this varies with each one of the effects.
    I strongly recommend you to study the <a href="poisons/effects.html">effects page</a> very
    carefully.<br>
    <br>
</ul>
<br>

<b>Making poisons</b><br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="mortar.jpg">
For making a poison you need to buy at least the &quot;mortar and pestle&quot; and some
<a href="vials.html#suspension">suspensions</a>. The mortar and pestle is a 6-space bag
with a combine button where you place all the components you need for the actual
receipt. As soon as you hit the combine button you will get your poison if your skill
is sufficient - else you will get your vial back. Every poison consists of:

<ul>
   <li>A <a href="vials.html">vial</a> (regular, lined or sealed)
   <li>A <a href="vials.html#suspension">suspension</a> (regular, constrict, larent or ethereal)
   <li>two or more <a href="ingredients/ingredients.html">ingredients</a>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Important:</b> the ingredients are not allowed to stack while making. That means if
the receipt requires you to use two Spider Venom Sacs you have to put each one of the
sacs in its own space or you will not produce anything! (AND the vial is lost)<br>
<br>
Please note that you <b>only</b> will gain skill in making poison when you
have reached your 21st level but you are able to make them at 20 too. The
ingredients are usually hard to get or expensive. You will need many hours
to farm them so I recommend to start collecting them at least at level 15.
You will usually gain quite fast from making poisons.<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>Applying Poison</b><br>
<br>
<br>
To apply a poison you need to be level 18 and train at least one point at your
guild. I suggest you put as many points in as you can afford - the skill is
hard/expensive enough to raise. The higher skill you have applying the poison,
the faster you will be done applying it. At the start you will need 7 seconds
to put a poison on your dagger, later it is rumored to be significantly less, but
I still cannot accomplish that.<br>
<br>
To poison a weapon you need a piercing one - they are the only ones who will
actually be possible to poison - make it stick to your mouse and click it on
the poison. You will get a &quot;you have successfully applied the poison&quot; or
a &quot;you failed to apply the poison&quot; message. In case you failed, the poison
is simply lost (WAAAAAA). If it worked, the poison will be applied <b>to your primary
weapon space</b> and will go off as soon as you do a piercing attack (other than backstab).
The poison attack is then checked against the poison resist value of the opponent
(means: it can be resisted). As you poison your weapon you will sit down automatically
and you have to stand up by yourself.<br>
<br>
The poison wears off (your weapon) when:<br>
<ul>
    <li>you leave the zone
    <li>you are disconnected
    <li>you camp
</ul>
You can now safe a pre-poisoned dagger for later because if you use a sword (1hs) and 
switch later to piercing, the poison will get off as soon as you land the first
piercing blow. Previously you have poisoned your hand and could not save the poison
for later but now you can.Fortunately the poisoning of a prey can no longer
be interrupted - this was a bug and is fixed now.<br>
<br>
As you get your Apply Poison skill from the guild at level 18 you have one great problem:
Where to get poisons? For your next two levels you will have several opportunities:<br>
<ul>
    <li>another rogue

    <li><a href="merchants/merchants.html#toxdil">Toxdil</a>
    When you give him 20gp pieces (<b>NOT</b> 2pp or something else!) and
    <a href="ingredients/ingredients.html#snake">2 snake venom sacs</a>
    he will give you a bottle of<a href="poisons/poisons.html#snake">snake
    poison</a> and a bit experience (<b>Quest</b>). 
    
    <li><a href="merchants/merchants.html#gindlin">Gindlin Toxfodder</a>
    who has a bit different quest than Toxdil. For 1 Crow's Special Brew,
    <a href="ingredients/ingredients.html#spider">2 Spider Venom Sacs</a> and 20gp you will get a flask of
    <a href="poisons/poisons.html#spider">Spider Venom</a> (<b>Quest</b>).

    <li><a href="merchants/merchants.html#conium">Conium Darkblade</a>
    gives you a flask of <a href="poisons/poisons.html#wasp">Wasp Poison</a>.
    for 3 <a href="ingredients/ingredients.html#wasp">Wasp Venom Sacs</a> and 30gp (<b>Quest</b>).

    <li>Crookstinger Poison - from the Crookstinger Wasp in Lesser Faydark

    <li>Vial of Rabid Froth - from the Undead gnoll Gnashmaw in South Karana
</ul>
<br>
<b>Produced Components</b>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ther are 4 produced ingredients: <a href="ingredients/ingredients.html#ironsul">Iron Sulphide</a>,
<a href="ingredients/ingredients.html#lperoxide">Lead Peroxide</a>,
<a href="ingredients/ingredients.html#quicksilver">Quicksilver</a> and
<a href="ingredients/ingredients.html#wlead">White Lead</a>. To produce the ingredients
take the necessary components as noted in the ingredients page and combine them in your
mortar&amp;pestle. The produced ingredients are not skill checked and will not fail, but you
also will not gain skill from it. They are limited to the receipts in the
<a href="books/miner.html">Miner's guide to Toxology</a> and seems to be a dwarfish speciality.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Final thoughts</b><br>
<br>
In General it is safe to say that poisoning works like a spell. The difference
to a spell is just that you can move now while poisoning something without
interrupting and you have to make and apply the poison.<br>
<br>
The use of poison is an art as making. You have to put in a lot of dedication
and money to grow up with that, but it is also very rewarding and fun. As mentioned before
the use is more of a tactical nature. You can use it for:<br>
<ul>
   <li>Soloing beasts out of your class.
   <li>Pvp - there a poison of the Blind or Paralyze class is <b>great</b>.
   <li>Supporting your group when killing tough beasts.
   <li>Improve your chances on a regular base with small poisons, especially on hard levels.
   <li>Give you a good chance of escape with a paralyzing poison
   <li>Make a good coin selling poisons
</ul>
You will surely find a lot more applications when you grow up with this
skill. A word on selling poisons: usually I offer a poison to a merchant
double and round the price when I plan to sell my precious flask. Do not
sell them too cheap. It is a lot of work, a lot of way and a lot of coins
you use for every single flask.<br>

<br>
<br>
Now you are equipped with the basic knowledge of poison. If you like that guide,
give me regards: poison a beast and shout you do so in my name. If I ever hear
that warcry, it will be my greatest reward.<br>
