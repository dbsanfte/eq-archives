<h1>Pottery for Rogues</h1>
<br>
<br>
Some of the rogues say &quot;Master it!&quot; some say &quot;Forget it and buy the vials!&quot;.
That is a point that you have to decide yourself - it depends on your poison usage habits and
the amount of money available. If you are a quite young rogue and usually low on money it is
a <b>must-have</b> skill. On a higher level you possibly will not bother with that anymore.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font size="+1">Starting</font></b>
<br>
<br>
To bring your skill to 122 you need about 20-40pp. You may invest a trainings point that
will give you the skill equal to your actual level and is a nice start but do not spend any
more points (would be simply a waste of precious points).<br>
<br>
Find yourself a cheap pottery merchant with a close pottery wheel and kiln and a merchant
that sells water. Make sure that all is possibly close together or you will do a lot of
running. <br>
<br>
<ul>
   <b>For Teir&acute;Dal rogues:</b> Buy sketches in the Southern Ro at the merchants camp and
   make your work in Neriak Foreign quaters where you can buy the rest from ChonChon.<br>
   <br>
</ul>
First of all: prepare yourself with 8 empty bagpacks. The more space you have the better.
Now go and buy:<br>
<ul>
   <li>40 Ceramic Lining Sketches
   <li>200 Medium Bowl Sketches
   <li>some stacks of water (NOT foraged!)
   <li>fill up the rest with 20 small blocks of clay
</ul>
Now it is time to go to the pottery wheel and make ceramic lining. Place in the <b>pottery wheel</b>:
<br>
<ul>
   <li>1 Ceramic Lining Sketch
   <li>1 small block of clay
   <li>1 flask of water
</ul>
Press the combine button and if you succeed you will get a &quot;unfired ceramic lining&quot;. Repeat
that until your skill reaches 36. If the stack of ceramic lining is not enough you may
continue with the jars or buy some more linings. You decide. You do not expect to get money
back anyway, do you?<br>
<br>
Now you can also decide if you want to fire your linings and sell them to a merchant, which
will reduce the price of your training a bit, or forget that crap and continue with the bowls.
In case you want to sell the linings or just have some fun with the kiln, go to the pottery
merchant close to you and buy as many <b>Quality firing sheets</b> as you have unfired linings.
Place in the <b>Kiln</b>:<br>
<ul>
    <li>1 Unfired Ceramic Lining
    <li>1 Quality Firing sheet
</ul>
After you hit combine, you will hopefully made a new item. Note, that you do not gain skill
with firing, you just get finished items!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font size="+1">Medium Bowls</font></b>
<br>
<br>
Now we are ready to do the Medium Bowls. Not that the trivial level of the bowls is at 122, so
you will fail a lot, but that does not hurt your skill gains and that is what we are heading
for. You should still have the sketches in your bag. Refresh the amount of water to the same
number of stacks as your sketches are. Also fill up your bag with <b>Blocks of clay</b>. Place
in the <b>pottery wheel</b>:
<br>
<ul>
   <li>1 Medium Bowl Sketch
   <li>1 flask of water
   <li>1 Block of clay
</ul>
<br>
This will give you and unfired med.bowl and you simply work your way through that bowls with
refills of the block of clay until you hit skill 122. If the 200 sketches are not enough,
buy enough to hit 122, that will depend on your skill. A good idea is to buff your int as
good as possible, that will increase your gain rate and reduce your costs.<br>
<br>
For firing you use:
<br>
<ul>
   <li>1 unfired Medium Bowl
   <li>2 high quality firing sheet
</ul>
<br>
Not that you need <b>TWO HIGH QUALITY firing sheets</b> now. Again: this step is optional and
you can also save the costs of the fireng sheets and the time and throw away the unfired bowls.
However
<p align=center><b>You are master now - Congratulations</b>.</P>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font size="+1">Poison vials</font></b>
<br>
<br>
It is time now to make poison vials. The sketches are comparably expensive but you will
get your vials as reward. You know how pottery works now so I will break down the vials
to the essential points.
<br>
<b>Vial receipt - Trivial at 148</b>
<ul>
    Pottery Wheel:<br>
    1 Vial sketch<br>
    1 Flask of water<br>
    1 small block of clay<br>
    1 animal skin or pelt<br>
    <br>
    Kiln:<br>
    1 unfired vial<br>
    1 high quality firing sheet<br>
</ul>
<br>
For the animal skins: The most interesting ones are the zombie skins because they stack.
Anyway you can also use a lot of different skins and pelts that are <b>not ruined!</b>.
Common not working pelts are: anything ruined, shark skin, silk swatches, shadow wolf,
lion skin, rat pelts and Deathfist pawn skalps.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Lined Vial receipt - Trivial at 168</b>
<ul>
    Pottery Wheel:<br>
    1 Lined Vial sketch<br>
    1 Flask of water<br>
    1 small block of clay<br>
    1 animal skin or pelt<br>
    <br>
    Kiln:<br>
    1 unfired vial<br>
    1 high quality firing sheet<br>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<b>Sealed Vial receipt - Trivial &gt;170</b>
<ul>
    Pottery Wheel:<br>
    1 Sealed Vial sketch<br>
    1 Flask of water<br>
    1 small block of clay<br>
    1 animal skin or pelt<br>
    <br>
    Kiln:<br>
    1 unfired vial<br>
    1 high quality firing sheet<br>
</ul>
<br>
Sealed vials have been broken for some time but work fine now. They are really expensive
so check out your best prices at the merchants and buff your charisma before you go shopping.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font size="+1">Merchants</font></b>
<br>
<br>
Here are some locations of common merchants. It is not complete but I never intended to
make a whole pottery site anyway.<br>
<br>
<ul>
   <b>North Freeport:</b> Kyrin Steelbone at Groflah&acute;s Forge and Winonyn right of the bank<br>
   <b>Southern Ro:</b> Two dark elf merchants selling everything needed at teh camp<br>
   <b>Kelethin:</b> Legwein at the PoD-lift and Nildar at the Orc-lift<br>
   <b>West Karana:</b> Tarnar at the location 1000/-2080<br>
   <b>Neriak:</b> ChonChon in the Foreign Quaters (Clay, Firing, Vial sketches)<br>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
Now you are equipped with everything a rogue must know about pottery. Keep in mind that vials
are also sold at the poison merchants and be aware that the &quot;empty vials&quot; that are
needed for the dyes, are not makable at all. That ones you have to purchase at the gnome-mills
in Steamfont Mountains. For further informations have a look at the various Everquest pages
in the web, there are a lot of pottery receipts around which are beyond the scope of this
little guide.
<br>
Have fun
