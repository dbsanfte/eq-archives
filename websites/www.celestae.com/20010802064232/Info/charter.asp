            for both our members and the other players on our server. Many of

          <td class="mencell">Members of our guild should wear their tag with 
            pride. However with our tag comes responsibility. The following details 
            the code of conduct and rules each member is expected to follow. 
            <p><b>1. Kill Stealing</b> - Kill stealing will not be tolerated by 
              any of our members. If a member of our guild kill steals you, you 
              are encouraged to first talk to that member for resolution. You 
              will find that most of our members are rational, well tempered individuals, 
              who just want to enjoy the game as you do. If you fail to gain resolution 
              by speaking directly with that person, then come to one of our officers. 
              Our officers will hear both side of the story, and decide the appropraite 
              action to take.</p>
            <p><b>2. Ebaying</b> - Our stance on ebaying is quite simple. It is 
              NOT tolerated. If a member of our guild is caught ebaying anything 
              everquest related, it is grounds for immediate removal from the 
              guild.</p>
            <p><b>3. Server conduct</b> - All of our members are to maintian their 
              discipline at all times. Never should a member of our guild cause 
              the intentional death of another player for any reason. Our members 
              should be courteous whenever possible.</p>
            <p><b>4. Message Board ettiquite</b> - Members are encouraged to be 
              courteous on message boards as well. However, since we have many 
              differenty types of personalities among us, we also encourage members 
              to speak their mind openly. The only guidelines members are required 
              to follow concerning messageboards, is to respect other guilds private 
              board(s). We in turn expect the same consideration. </p>
            <p><b>5. Guild Raids</b> - Guild raids are just that, guild raids. 
              All spots will be filled by guild members first if possible, remaining 
              spots will be filled on an invite only basis. This is only fair 
              to our members. However, we will lead open raids, and semi open 
              raids regularly. Open raids are on a first come, first accepted 
              basis, and open raiding schedule will be posted on our message board. 
              Semi-Open raids will be invite or application raids. We are not 
              (repeat: not) a group of elitists. We want as many people as possible 
              to experience planes, dragon runs, etc, as possible.</p>
            <p><b>6. Loot Distribution</b> - Any loot that drops on a guild raid 
              will be called by the guild officers. This will be done according 
              to several factors, including, but not limited to the following: 
              Seniority, number of raids attended, items usefullness to your class. 
              All loot on Open and semi-open raids will be rolled for by the raid 
              leader(s).<br>
            </p>
            <p><b>7.</b> <b>Grouping Guildlines</b></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><b><i>A. Grouping outside of the guild</i></b><br>
                We encourage grouping outside the guild at any time. Please be 
                responsible and polite when grouping with members of other guilds. 
                Our relations with the players on the server are very important. 
                When making loot rules be fair to those not in the guild. The 
                guild will not dictate how you run your outside group looting 
                - but it is encouraged that you show kindness and not be selfish.</p>
              <p><b><i>B. Grouping with Guildmates</i></b><br>
                We are going to work hard to make sure people in Celestae can 
                find groups within the guild if at all possible. A tracking system 
                will be made to help members get the groups they need to accomplish 
                the goals they seek. Remember this is a two way street - if someone 
                helps you do something one night be prepared to help that person 
                on another night. we can't stress how important it is that we 
                help eachother like this. The guild will be much more active and 
                organized with some of the plans we are going to put in place 
                so this should help guild members group.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><b>8. Guild Playstyle</b><br>
              This is just a guideline. The guild will not enforce any playstyle 
              on its members. But at the same time some members have different 
              goals than others. It is very important that guild members respect 
              eachother's goals and playstyle. Just because someone has fun a 
              different way than you do doesn't make them less skilled or more 
              skilled. My view of the guild is that we are all here to have a 
              good time but we do have serious goals to do raids and kill the 
              big guns of the game. With cooperation we can do this and still 
              have alot of fun. Sure we aren't going to be first there but we 
              are going to be there mark my words.</p>
            <p><b>9. Guild Tags</b><br>
              You are encouraged to be non-anon whenever you can. We are not going 
              to force you to do so. The next step would be to use &quot;role 
              play.&quot; At least in this step your affiliation is known. Some 
              players just like to be totally anon - that is their own choice. 
              If I put a guideline down saying you had to be a certain way then 
              someone would have a problem with it - hence these are only recommended 
              settings. But whenever you can show your pride in being a Celestae 
              member.</p>
            <p><b><i>10. Alternate Characters</i></b><br>
              Many of you have made alternate characters. It is good to blow off 
              steam or ease the tedium of hours of leveling the same thing over 
              and over. You have 8 character slots - they are there for a reason. 
            </p>
            <p>But let's not go crazy. Let's keep the number of alts in the guild 
              down to 1 to start with. Try to keep them ANON if possible just 
              to keep the list down. Also - identify who you are every time you 
              log in or off so people get used to this being your alt. As time 
              goes I am sure we can ease the restrictions on this. At this time 
              I don't think a level limit is neccessary for alts. As long as your 
              main is level 30 or above you meet guild requirements. <br>

<p>So you want to join our guild eh? Well if you are dedicated individual 
              who wants to take the most out of his everquest experiences as possible, 
              then we want you. The first step towards joining is to let us know 
              of your interest by a) talking to a member or (preferably) an officer 
              in game, or b) posting on our message board under the recruiting 
              board. We will then make a post under the members only recruiting 
              section, where our members will have a chance to express their opinios 
              of you privately. After a few days to a few weeks, you will be given 
              a decision.</p>
            Loyalty is very important to Celestae. We wish to attain a close-knit 
            group of players here who care about eachother. If you are more concerned 
            with yourself, or loot - this isn't the guild for you. We reward our 
            members who show loyalty, dedication and care for other members. Membership 
            is also a one-way door, that is, if you decide to leave we will sadly 
            say farewell and wish you the best but Celestae will not re-admit 
            you once you go.<br>

            Responsiblities are to oversee the officers, deligate their duties, 
            discipline the officers, plan raids, review recruits with the Executive 
            Officer (explained later), and have an open ear to all guild members. 
            he will have an open door policy - meaning heencourage members come 
            to him with questions, advice or problems if you feel an officer cannot 
            address them. Please try to give the officers a chance though. 
            <p><b><i>Executive Officer</i></b> - Furrios<br>
              The XO is in charge of guild recruitment as well as removing members 
              from the guild. Many times he will be responsible for disciplining 
              someone for doing something wrong. He is also in charge of awards. 
              Yes I said it - awards. We are going to have awards in this guild. 
              Sometimes they will just be a nice title you can hang over your 
              head proudly and others could even be an item or a special raid 
              dedicated to you. The XO will work on this. He is also available 
              to discuss problems with members and pass them on to me or other 
              officers but again please try to see another officer if your situation 
              can be rectified before going to the XO.</p>
            <p><b><i>Treasurer</i></b> - Dartex<br>
              We need a guild treasurer. Raids are expensive. Our casters will 
              need expensive components many times in order to keep our tanks 
              alive. Also - members can donate items to the treasury and we will 
              have an active list on our web site of what items are available. 
              The treasurer is responsible for distributing these items as well 
              as the overall account of our guild's worth in platinum. We will 
              begin making a guild bank account in order to dump money in there 
              soon. This money will be used for raids, events and to help members 
              when they need money for emergencies. You are encouraged to donate 
              whatever you want to the coin bank - although it is NOT required. 
              Just remember though - when a raid comes - that our casters will 
              be drawing from this bank to save lives.</p>
            <p><b><i>Ambassadors</i></b><br>
              This officer is the common officer of the guild. Each ambassador 
              is responsible for member issues and relations as well as relations 
              with 1 guild on the server. They can invite members to the guild 
              as well (as long as the recruit is approved by the Guildmaster or 
              Executive Officer).</p>
            <p><b><i>Public Relations Officer</i></b> - Gard<br>
              This person is in charge of our official response on message boards 
              and news postings. It is VERY important that this person has an 
              open mind and acts with courtesy and friendliness even in bad situations. 
              He will also be responsible for adding news to our web page.</p>
            <p>Our members are not encouraged to post flames on message boards 
              or respond to them. If you do feel the need to post something that 
              may not be in the guild's interest please note in your post that 
              your post is not the views of the guild - they are your own. We 
              trust our members to handle themselves in a courteous manner when 
              they deal with the public.</p>
            <p><b><i>RaidMaster</i></b> - Bammbi<br>
              No this isn't a new brand of bug spray. This person is in charge 
              of organizing our raids and events. He will have a few people working 
              for him coming up with ideas for raids, and planning the actual 
              raids. The Raidmaster will also work closely with the GuildMaster 
              to ensure the raids go smoothly. The RaidMaster can also assign 
              guild members to be a raid leader if he feels that person can do 
              the job. The RaidMaster should never have to deal with guild issues 
              not related to raids that will distract him from this job - it can 
              cause loss of life. </p>
            <p><b><i>Raid Officer</i></b><br>
              These are the people that help the RaidMaster organize and plan 
              raids. They can also lead them. Like the RaidMaster, the Raid Officers 
              should not be contacted for guild issues not related to the raids 
              themselves.</p>
