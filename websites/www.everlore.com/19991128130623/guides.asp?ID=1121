<!--<tr><td><font face="verdana">There are a lot of guides out there, but there are also some things that each race and class has in common at lower levels.  Here are a couple of tips for any beginner in the world of Norrath:
Quests:
Except for getting your tunic, leave quests alone for a few levels.  In order to complete a lot of them, you need to know your way around, and you need to survive.  Better to go out and fight, gain a few levels, and get familiar with the environment first.
  
Armor:
If you are a warrior type class, put a point or two into tailoring each level.  At about level 4 or 5, make a complete set of armor.  you won't regret it. (BTW: I'm sorry for those of you wearing med. sizes)

Bank:
Once you hit level 3, make frequent trips to the bank.  Try depositing all your copper and silver and just holding on to your gold (then plat).  You'll quickly build up a nice reserve of cash for when you REALLY need it.  Also, after you get your not so shiny or new battle axe or great staff, put the next one in the bank, don't sell it.  After that, sell all the weapons you get, but save the second one.  Finally, don't forget that you can store items in backpacks in the bank.

Containers:
Get one.  Get a big one.  Get a backpack. :)  By level 4 you MUST have a backpack, if not two.  If you want to make money, that's how to do it.

On Money and Levels:
Level 1-4: Go out, kill only Skeletons and _____ (bats, wasps, etc.).  Each time you do this, stick to those two creatures, because you may not have a backpack and you are more efficient this way.  Go out, kill these creatures until you reach a level, then return and sell.  Repeat until level 4 or so.

That's it.  I may submit additions later, but for now, just follow those rules.  Enjoy, and I'll see you in Norrath!
