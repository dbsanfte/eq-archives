It would of been nice if they made the spell like 1150mage, keep the druids at 1024.  But this is better than what we had.<P>I don't know what made Verant change their mind.  Probably never will know.  But if our long threads did or did not have anything to do with it on GAMEPLAY.  Who knows.  Just as long as we did get what is coming to us.

</FONT><HR>[WARNING: slight rant -- which, in advance, I will grant is early since allegedly the spells "will change."  Ummm.... riiiight.]<P>I noticed, but frankly, I don't really care.  DD, in my opinion, is not the issue we really need to be worried about.  I realize that magicians are supposed to be the second best nukers, but that's not the role about which I am really concerned.  It's our role as summoners that has me leery about the upcoming new spells.<P>Anyone see any improvements to the summons we're supposed to be getting?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Personally, I'd be happy to give up a couple hundred points of casting damage (especially if they're going to make it a bolt anyway) for some useful summon spells.  I'd much rather have the ability to summon something useful (after all, I'm supposed to be a master of summoning), than the ability to summon a whole bunch of things at once that I could have done just as easily with a couple of level 1,4, 8 or, at most, 20 spells.<P>Maybe it's just me, and I'm getting peeved about the wrong issue, but I thought we were supposed to be summoning masters.  After all, that's what Verant told us.  Well, if I'm a "summoning master," go ahead and take some of my casting damage (make me third or whatever), but please, damn well make my summons worthwhile.<P>*still trying to find a use for a spear of warding other than a giant's toothpick and ever so pleased that the expansion is likely to make magicians only able to summon MORE of already worthless summoned items*<P>Citer Delaterre [Bootleggers]<BR>44th season magician<BR>Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=7&topic=000643.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=Magician|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Well+did+any+of+you+guys+notice+hmmmm">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#D9DCE8">

</FONT><HR>Well I try to fight the battles where I think we at least have a slight chance of winning.<P>Ok on summoning are they going to allow us to summon some stuff that gives us a sow ability.  That would be wonderful, but I really don't think they are going to give us that.  Will they allow us to summon a sword that is better than a Yekesha (spelled that wrong).  I don't think so either.<P>I do not argue with you that many of our summon spells just plain suck.  I still use the heatstone spell (I'm human), I have made some bucks off the summon arrow spell.  You are right others like the spear are useless.<P>But I say one step at a time.  I think the post 50th level spells before we were on a short tract to extinction.  Now we got a better chance.  DD is huge importance.  Why do Wizards, Druids, Mages fight like cats and dogs for every DD point possible.  I mean the wizards still have threads 200, 300 posts long whinning about their DD vs us on the Gameplay board.  If DD was not important why does everyone care about it so much.  BECAUSE IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT IS WHY.   We now out damage a druid.  A party leader will not throw us out because we are not a druid.  We outdamage him.  He is more versatile.  If you were a party leader you now have a choice.  Before they bumped up our spell and knocked down theirs.  We did not stand a chance of getting into a group unless they were your guild buddies.<P>No this is good news.  I have had Abashi respond to my threads.  You got to pick and choose your battles.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=7&topic=000643.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=Magician|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Well+did+any+of+you+guys+notice+hmmmm">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#E8EAF0">

Last i checked BOLTS are our strength. Outdoor soloing there is NOTHING that is good as a bolt.<P>Me a druid and a shammy hunt ice giants outside of perma, bolts rock hard there, never get touched, we are talking pleanty to time to manuver and such. I can line up shots from large distances and no worries! Last i checked i have yet to go into places like lower stuck and solb. It would also appear that in Kunark will have large outdoor zones the size of west karana. (as told by Brad)<P>So guess what BOLTS are GOOD. Any mage that dosent know how to properly use their BOLT spells shouldnt be playing a mage!<P>/em casts endure fire<BR><p>[This message has been edited by Auir (edited 04-18-2000).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=7&topic=000643.cgi&ReplyNum=000005&forum=Magician|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Well+did+any+of+you+guys+notice+hmmmm">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#E8EAF0">

</FONT><HR>I think you've contradicted yourself a little bit, since you said that bolts are good but virtually useless in dungeons (where MANY high level players) spend most/all of their time.<P>However, I kind of agree with you.  Bolt spells have their place, just as many spells for many classes.  This is why my complaint is not with the damage spells at all and is instead with the poor summon spells we're getting.<P>I think what is most important to note though is that it seems that most magicians are agreeing that there is SOMETHING wrong with the expansion spells for the magician class, whether the problem lies with damage, summoning or some other cause.  That says to me that there are problems ahead.  I guess we'll see.<P>Citer Delaterre</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=7&topic=000643.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=Magician|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Well+did+any+of+you+guys+notice+hmmmm">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#D9DCE8">

</FONT><HR>I recently got my lvl 49 spells. I am still amazed with my pets, first thing I did was summon the best pet I could (that was the best part, asking the lvl 41 wizzy "what does this one con?...EVEN") then I threw it two sword of runes burnout three and a lavashield said pull and watched it solo a seafurry with 30% hp left. Next one i levitated myself and said watch this, I aimed a bolt at his but and poof it goes right into the tank. I line another one up and the battle is over before i finish my cast. This is an outside zone it is wide open and yet i waste 300 mana and 810 damage cause someone moved. I haven't used the spell since, mostly cause I have been in Guk, Sol b, Hate, Kedge, PoS. If a bolt dosen't hit in wide open spaces whats the chance of it hitting in a dungeon or any kind of raid. I know my class and I know bolts are worthless, in 80% of the situations.<P>Our summons spells, I've said before I'll say it again *mages skill at helping newbs has increased, 9999999* all there doing is making 3 lvl 8 spells into 1 lvl 55 spell. There is one spell i see which will help out a lot if it goes live *decides not to hold his breath* and that is summon hero. All in all I give our spells a F---------------------------------------------------------------.<BR>Our spell suck every class knows it and says asks me if I like our class likes getting it *censored*. Well didn't mean for this to be a rant but, here i am.<P>Overseer<BR>Lvl 49 mage-Povar<BR>Soldier of T'or Drakkon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=7&topic=000643.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=Magician|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Well+did+any+of+you+guys+notice+hmmmm">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#E8EAF0">

</FONT><HR>Well one day I'm going to see,<P>Cazic Thule has chalenged Overseer to a duel. Cazic Thule has run like a cowardly dog.<P>Anyway I digress.  I have had more success with my bolt spells like Auir said.  I like them alot outdoors.  I seem to hit what I want alot and I love the range.  Now indoors they suck.  Will agree 100% on that one.  But what I think might be a good stradegy is use them on a moster who is over 1/2 dead anyway.  Go up almost point blank, get a better LOS and fire away.  That way even if the MOB will agro on you it prob will die before you will.  Outdoors I like my bolts.  <P>The summon spells past 50 suck.  I'd think everyone is in agreement on that.  We can only try to change them, or have Verant add more viable ones.  But I still feel better than I did early last week.<P>PS: Overseer if you happen to kill the Hero more than once my rogue would sure love a bracer.  LOL.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=7&topic=000643.cgi&ReplyNum=000008&forum=Magician|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Well+did+any+of+you+guys+notice+hmmmm">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#D9DCE8">

</FONT><HR>What I noticed in all of these posts is quite obvious to me, but overlooked by most others:<P>Yes bolts are HARD to use in dungeons (me, I just walk up until I am standing next to the target and let fly, then run back out of melee range. rarely miss a bolt that way..)<P>But.....<P>The dungeons you speak of are in the current game. Ruins of Kunark will have HUGE outdoor zones where the bolts work best and I am betting that there will be PLENTY high level stuff to shoot at that is not in a dungeon.<P>Either way, I have no problems with bolts in dungeons or out. I will love the new bolt spell!<P>------------------<BR>Artamus Spellweaver,<BR>Gate Caller of the 7th Circle of Erud<BR>Officer of the Seekers of Lore<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=7&topic=000643.cgi&ReplyNum=000009&forum=Magician|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Well+did+any+of+you+guys+notice+hmmmm">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#E8EAF0">
