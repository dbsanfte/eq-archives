</FONT><HR>Currently the person or group that gets credit for a kill is the one who deals the most damage.  This in turn allows high damage dealing classes to KS from others easily.  I think the method of counting only the damage dealt to a creature is ignoring half of the fight, the damage absorbed is ignored.<P>A simple solution to this would be to add up damage dealt to a mob and damage absorbed from a mob when determining ownership of a kill.   Actual damage dealt to you would not be a perfect method though, as some characters rely on dodging hits altogether or high AC or magic resistances to limit damage, and those people should not be penalized for that.<P>Each mob should have an average damage number.  That would be equal to the average damage per hit it is supposed to do vs an average character of appropriate level.  Each time a mob swings at you or casts on you (hit or miss, big hit or little one), that number would be added to your running total of damage for that fight.  At the end who ever has the most total amount of damage dealt plus damage that should have been absorbed gets the kill.<P>--Cador<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=001090.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=Everlore+Main+Hall&TopicSubject=Change+for+who+gets+kill">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>And I think that the person who "kills" the mob should be credited for killing it.<P>As George Patton once said, "I don't want to hear any silly s.o.b. talk about dying for his country.  I want you to kill the enemy and let the other guy die for HIS country."<P>It's just a lesson in reality.  To the victor goes the spoils.

</FONT><HR>Actually this point makes a lot of sense.  It may help in stopping KS'ing, or it may convince KSing Wizards to just manadump their biggest spells when they KS.<P>They idea (as I understand it) would be to treat damage inflicted by the MOB as hit points inflicted by the fighting "team."  In this way, if (for example) ole Mucktail with his PGT is whacking at a melee party trying to win a PGT and some caster pops up and decides to make the melee folks his personal shield, all of Mucktail's damage inflicted is added to the melee types and compared to the total done by the caster.  It does help the discrepancies a lot.<P>The only downside is that Warriors can now KS with their vaunted Taunt ability by willingly absorbing damage.  (that is meant to hold a small hint of sarcasm)<P>I don't care what Patton said.  He didn't live in Norrath, his troops wouldn't respawn, and he didn't have to camp 24 hours waiting for Rommel to spawn with a panzer division only to have some wizard nuke the ultra-rare Rommel spawn so that wizard could then twink his new 1st level Panzer commander. (I'm still twink neutral, I have always been very anti-KS)<P><P>------------------<BR>Nicophorus,<BR>Paladin of Mithaniel,<BR>Leader- Order of Kynigos<BR>http://cgray.home.texas.net/kynigos/<BR>Brell Serilis Server<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=001090.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=Everlore+Main+Hall&TopicSubject=Change+for+who+gets+kill">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>While the idea that taking damage from a mob should facter into who gets credit for the kill has some validity the idea that it would be simple to impliment must come from someone with no idea how complicated implementing "simple" ideas can be.<P>It would also cause new types of KSing.  A group of fighter could increase thier chanses of getting the exp/loot by puting their armor in thier backpacks.  While this would be risky a group who might be able to inflict minimal damage on a mob but can take hundreds of HP of damage could  KS a rare spawn from those that actually killed it.  Also the idea of giving credit for possible damage other than actual is a twinkers dream.<P>I think a better idea is to give bonuses based on first hit and number of hits so that 30 10pt hits count more than 1 300pt nuke. <BR>Another idea might be to give less credit when the mob is Green to the attacker so high level characters have less of a chance to KS from others.  If a character is 5 levels higher than the mob he/she should only get 50% credit for damage done and if the char is 10+ levels higher they should only get 10%. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=001090.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=Everlore+Main+Hall&TopicSubject=Change+for+who+gets+kill">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>Drak,<P>I agree and disagree.<P>I agree that it isn't an easy implementation, but it is worth looking into.<P>I disagree with the alleged warrior KS problem.  I doubt that many warriors will be able to stand there with no armor and KS from a wizard.  Even IF they were to, at least they are risking death as opposed to the casters who currently use melee types as human(oid) shields to KS from.  Granted, I am a melee type and have a bias, but come on dying to KS?  That's kind of funny.<P>Number of hits being factored in... hmm, maybe.  BUT that does give a warrior a fair shot at KSing (which I don't want to see happen).  I can switch to a low damage low delay weapon and hit all day while that KS wizard (I really like wizards, they just work for these examples) manadumps.  It shifts the balance of power, but I don't want balance of power shifted, I'd like to put a death blow on kill stealing.<P>Taking damage is a valid part of the equation.  Actually, since healing is worked into MOB agro logic, there is some precedent for using non-damage for determinging results.  <P>My point is, KS is bad.  It should be stopped.  Group damage helps, but doesn't do enough.  The original poster has given something to think about, IMO.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Nicophorus,<BR>Paladin of Mithaniel,<BR>Leader- Order of Kynigos<BR>http://cgray.home.texas.net/kynigos/<BR>Brell Serilis Server<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=001090.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=Everlore+Main+Hall&TopicSubject=Change+for+who+gets+kill">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>Someone,<P>That's a good point.<P>I guess, what Verant has stated by their approach to implementation is that powerleveling is more undesirable then kill stealing.  I disagree with that entirely.  I find KSing to be an atrocity and powerleveling to be no more offensive than twinking (which Verant condones).<P>MS (manastealing?) isn't stealing.  If a melee type wants to pull at range, they buy a bow, period.  I have one, it works fine.  Don't like the range on the hunter or longbows?  Go find a fletcher.<P>Perhaps double valuing (or some multiple) the hits that the initiator of the fight gives would help.  Of course, if the petition to allow multi-grouping for Plane Raids and such gets listened to AND Verant will acknowledge that Kill Stealing (which invasively effects the fun of another customer) is far less offensive than powerleveling a friend (which invasively causes...grouping? something Verant wants anyhow) then your solution would be perfect.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Nicophorus,<BR>Paladin of Mithaniel,<BR>Leader- Order of Kynigos<BR>http://cgray.home.texas.net/kynigos/<BR>Brell Serilis Server<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=001090.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=Everlore+Main+Hall&TopicSubject=Change+for+who+gets+kill">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>Yeah, but in trying to manipulate the game, you guys are missing a simple central point, which is, the person who kills a mob should get credit for it.  To me, hearing someone say they "should" get credit for killing a mob because they came closest to getting killed BY the mob is silly.  The idea is to inflict damage, not take it.  Manipulating the game so that PC's are trying to get hurt would be just plain bizarre.<P>For example, some silly turkey who pulls a train or a red mob and then runs around yelling for help, and is saved by kind bystanders, would get a huge exp bonus for making one of the worst mistakes in the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=001090.cgi&ReplyNum=000008&forum=Everlore+Main+Hall&TopicSubject=Change+for+who+gets+kill">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>Anyka,<P>And thus, anyone who wants to sit and KS should be able to?  Petitioning is your only "defense" currently and lets face it, that is post-facto.<P>Also, you assume XP is strictly "kill" related.  If that were true then the whole party shouldn't get XP, just the character deliviering the killing blow.  <P>Thirdly, the person getting the crap torn out of them should certainly be "learing" from it (which by the way IS XP), and someone KS'ing should receive no credit for using another as a shield.<P>There are definate and plausible reasons to modify the XP formula.  Verant obviously noted this with the "party based" XP.  Were you against that chage?  It certainly doesn't necesarily reward the individual doing the most damage, or the individual killing the monster.  It, instead, is an attempt to make the system "fair."  Fair being a valid concept in a game.<P>I'm not saying this HAS to be done to save the validity of the game.  My thoughts are that the origin of this post has something to do with finding a way to reward the party fighting the creature and to hamper kill stealing.  That is a very good idea and one worth exploring, IMO.<P>Are there flaws in these ideas, definately.  But to simply negate the idea is...silly.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Nicophorus,<BR>Paladin of Mithaniel,<BR>Leader- Order of Kynigos<BR>http://cgray.home.texas.net/kynigos/<BR>Brell Serilis Server<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=001090.cgi&ReplyNum=000009&forum=Everlore+Main+Hall&TopicSubject=Change+for+who+gets+kill">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>There could be limits on how damage absorbed could be factored in.  One method would be damage absorbed acts as a multiplier to damage dealt, ie if you take all the hits your damage total is doubled, if you take 75 percent of the hits your damage is multiplied by 1.75, etc.<P>If something like this was used, it would require someone to deal 67 percent of the damage to get credit for a kill without taking a hit.  It would also mean people could not abuse the system by letting stuff almost kill them and call for help, as in Anyka’s example.<P>I also like Drakthirteen’s idea about having higher level characters damage count for less and less the greener the mob is to them.<P>KSing exists because it is very easy and works almost all the time.  Combine these two ideas and you have balanced the game enough so that it makes KSing something less than a sure bet.<P>--Cador<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=001090.cgi&ReplyNum=000011&forum=Everlore+Main+Hall&TopicSubject=Change+for+who+gets+kill">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >
