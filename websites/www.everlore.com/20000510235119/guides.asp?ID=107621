<!--<tr><td><font face="verdana">Welcome to the Complete Guide to Fishing in Norrath.

This guide will detail all the parts related to the skills and objectives of fishing in any town.

LOCATION
Location is one of the most important things for any begginging fisherman. If you are bound, stuck, leveling, etc. in a completely dry zone, there isn't much point to thinking about fishing. Also, you must consider if you plan to forage for fishing grubs, that you are in a zone that has them availible as a forageable item. In general, larger locations are better to fish in then smaller. Although there really isn't any "depletion of fish in the lakes and oceans of Norrath, the feel isn't there when fishing in a puddle.

TIME
If you are hoping to make any money fishing, then plan on passing a lot of time with your pole in hand, and your bait in the water. Being a fisherman isn't the way to lead grandly into a hundred platinum future. Of all the skills you put money too, it probably costs the least and returns little more than you put in. In general, it is a good way for a new player to spend time making money for the first few levels, or for an advanced player to have fun, not have to buy food, or to pass the time while waiting for a boat, or while on a boat.

RACE
My idea of the best race for fishing is anyone that starts or has there main city by water, or a race or class that has forage as another skill.

STUFF
What you need for fishing boils down to the bare minimum of any skill. Yourself, for fishing of course, Bait, no fish is that stupid, and a Fishing Pole, prefered is the Gnomish Collapsable pole that fits in a pack, but a normal pole will do just fine.
At my current level, and at a fair but not extremely high Charisma amount, as well as better than average faction, Bait costs me around 3 copper (it varies with some people, I've heard up to five), Or free if it is foraged. As well, the pole costs around 2 gold and 2 silver (give or take a few silver) and the Gnomish Pole can reach larger prices into tens to hundreds of platinum for it's increased usefulness.

BEER
What better way to fish than to relax infront of the water with a good 20 of your favorite brew. Absolutely nothing is wrong with this, and I've even cought my largest hauls while completely drunk (although drunkeness doesn't affect your ability in the better, or as far as I can tell the worse) However it isn't without risks. As many of you may know while *ahem* "strategically increasing your alcohol tolerance" close things look farther away, and both you and your world tend to wobble back and forth (especially dangerous in Kelethin :) The same danger can apply to you while fishing. You can be right up next to the water and it will look like your fifteen feet away. Trust me, don't walk forward, as long as you can cast your line, your fine. Also, if you walk parallel to the water (sideways along the shoreline) Your wobbling, similar to tunnel vision and closeness, has a tendency to land you in the water. Don't panic, it can be hard to get back up, but just ignore the wobble, face the shore and keep moving until your sure your very far away.

HOW TO FISH
Beer surely can only lead into the subject of how to fish. Really this catagory has no rules, fishing from high up on a cliff is just as effective as right on the shore. If you find yourself on the shore, but unable to fish, back up a little because you can't fish at all even in toe deep water. I have not confirmed this, but I tend to have better luck fishing when I neither talk, nor move, nor use any other skill while fishing. Although if this isn't true, it is a great amount of time for you to message your friends or use sense heading or another alternately useable skill. Now, to actually fish, you have to have your Fishing Pole in your main weapon hand, remember this so that you don't run out into the next zone when your done and try to beat an Orc Oracle to death with a little wooden pole. After you have your pole in your main hand, make sure you have bait, then get next to the water and click the FISHING skill button. The messages and results you will recive will be covered later.

WHAT YOU GET
There isn't a whole ton of things that people leave in the sea, it pretty much boils down to these things.
Fish-the most expensive thing you will catch, it can sell anywhere from 1-2 silver which is a lot for fishing. As well, this is both edible and stackable. Rusty Daggers-The second most expensive thing you get. You should not have to use this as it isn't really even close to being a good weapon. However, if you would like to practice your throwing skill this is a quick and cheap way to get throwable daggers. These sell from around 1 to 1.3 silver (1 silver 3 copper)
Some Sort of Sandle-It looks like a sandle with seaweed on it, it's ac is only 1 but i have to admit I did wear it for about a day. It doesn't way very much and it also sells for around 1-1.2 silver.
Fish Scales-I'm sure these are used for something else as well, but I usually just sell them, the sell around me from 4-6 copper and are stackable.

MESSAGES AND RESULTS
This catagory tells you all the possible messages and results that will happen while you fish.
"You cast your line"-This is the basic first message that results when ever you push the FISHING button to begin.
"You failed to catch anything"-This is the message you will get most of the time unless your skill is very high, it just means you still have your bait and you need to cast your line again.
"You lost your bait"-This means exactly what it says, you loose 1 piece of bait and get nothing in return don' worry it doesn't happen very often.
"Your fishing pole broke"-This can be a bummer as it means you have to shell out another 2 gold to get a rod, this is pretty rare though, and you will more than make up for money lost here in returns from selling your catch.
"You caught something..."-This message means that you either caught a rusty dagger, a sandle, or fish scales. The great thing about this is that you can make money with these and not even loose your bait. None of them are stackable however.
"You caught a fish!"-This too means exactly what it says, you catch one fish in return for the loss of one piece of bait, a good trade.
"You spill your beer while brining in your line"-Just one of those mood enhancing messages, it does't mean anything and it happens even if you have no alcohol, just enjoy it!
"Your Fishing skill has increased (###)-Like any other skill with practice your skill in fishing increases.

That's pretty much it for fishing, I wish you all the best of luck, but don't move in on me fishin hole matey or ial trow ya right inna da drink.</font></td></tr>-->

				You can not fish from the large boats that cross the zones.  Yes, very annoying.  Also, fish scales are for the Enduring Breath spell.  Hence why you see many Shaman fishing away while meditating.  Dragnor's Cauldron is a good place to fish, as you can sell (or give, they usually reward you later somehow.  And they don't have nay money on them right then anyways) high levelers that have died in Kedge Keep and need the Fish scale component to cast Enduring Breath so they can get their corpse. :)
