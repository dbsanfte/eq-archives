</FONT><HR>I currently play a rogue, nd love it, BUT when the new servers come I am planning on hopping servers, and becoming a HUMAN shadowknight. I know, i know, .... human shadowknights "suck" as many put it, but I think it'll be fun to roleplay a human evil knight. <P>Just wanted to know if any of you had any advice. <P>I know the Freeport area very well, thing is I was planning on worshipping Bertoxullous, and they all start in Qeynos. And as we all know, when new aervers come up the newbie areas are simply MOBBED, so just wanted to know if there are any quest ijn Qeynos that can make levelling easier.<P>And all of you human shadowknights have any tips for a young one? Don't worry, it is NOT a twinking question since on a NEW server we are all startong from scratch.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=000532.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=Shadow+Knight|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Prospective+Human+SK">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#D9DCE8">

</FONT><HR>play a troll you wont regret it.  if you worried about faction.  Dont.  faction has never been a concern for me.  the reason i say play a troll is because we have the 2nd best stats.  ogres only beat us because of their higher STR and STA.  but one thing they dont have is Regen.  yes trolls lvl the fastest.  but being a troll SK is the best.  trolls/ogres also have the best starting newbie zone.  the swamps and feerrott.  in the swamps you can get all you netted armor.  you can also save then netted gloves and sell to monks for a nice profit.  then the lizards in front of CT drop rawhide armor.  <P>ok reasons to be a human.  you are accepted everywhere.  do you care about ease of travel.  Being every other race forces you to be on your toes.  it makes you pay attention to your surrondings.<P>If the iksar can be lizards.  then you might want to try them.  they have some great benefits i think.  rumor to have regen, night vision, tail attack, and decent stats.  <P>i know this is not what you are looking for.  but i am a troll.  what do you expect.  play a troll and never look back.  or try the new iksar.  <P>------------------<BR>messiguts seppukku<BR>44th lvl TSK<BR>brell serilis</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=000532.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=Shadow+Knight|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Prospective+Human+SK">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#E8EAF0">

</FONT><HR>I play a human shadowknight on Luclin, just re-started my character again. Anyone who says a human shadowknight sucks is a moron, let them pick there fav class and they will be happy with it.<P>I played lots and lots of trolls as they look better than oges in my opinion, so i decided for something new as i had just played a human char and found it REALLY good.<P>So anyway i picked a human sk, good points are you stats, they are all high so you can do anything well. Put lots of points into STR if you want to be really good at 2 handed, but i prefer to keep my stats even. I got my base stats upto:<BR>STR:90<BR>INT:95<BR>STA: what ever was left<P>and my stats are really good, i have no weekness, well maby dex and ago but not that is effects me a great deal, a few low lv jewlery i picked up, 2 derv rings, +3 int ring from qeynos quest and a +2 agi earing i picked up along the way. <P>The only thing i can say is that with 90 STR bronze armour REALLY weighs me down, maby 100 base would be better for people who like to carry lots of loot. Personally i prefer 90 base as i can get almost full bronze armour and carry a 2 handed wepon and i am not envumberd although i cannot afford to cary any loot really for long periods of time.<BR>But on the other hand i can put more points into STA, any spare points into STA really helps.<P>With a human you can pump the int up a bit, i loved 100 int base but decided to drop 5 and put it into sta this time and i havent regreted it so far. With a int above 80 you really do quite well, wepon skills gain a lot faster and you become quite effective, a human shadowknight can beat most hybrids his lv because of one reason, higher skill caps, shadowknights have higher skill caps normally wich gives the impression of you being more effective in combat.<P>Humans have some good starting locations, personally i prefer Bertoxxulous and Qeynos, it is a much nicer place to lv and make money, more roleplaying oportunities and the very sceene is so tence with druid/rager and the cleric/paladin guilds waging war agaist you plus the militia pretending to keep you in line.<BR>The main reason i picked human was because i like to play them, it feels right, the stats match my style of play, 1 handed and 2 handed depending on situation, they look really cool in plate armour even bronze. They look more imposing than a dark elf or erudite, erudites look like pansys and dark elf are to small for my likeing, a human in plate looks like he can take a beating, the only shadowknights bigger are the two biguns, ogre and troll.<P>These are the reason i picked my human sk and i havent regreted it, the only thing that is hard is a vision, i got a summoned wepon and me and a pet killed wisps at lv9 quite easy with summoned daggar and speer, that sorts you out at first, later on a preserved split paw eye (superior to lightstone in my opinion, +2 resist poison, weighs less and goes into range slot) I dont carry a bow as i want to keep my siphon str on and plus i dont want excess bagage. Aslo you get the DEADEYE spell at lv22 wich gives you infravision at 22, after that the human sk becomes so much more fun.<P>So here is my reason to play a human sk in short:<BR>Good mix of melee and spells, prob the best mix.<P>Good mix of stats not lacking in any makes you effective in all and since you are a hybrid more usefull.<P>Faction, dont worrie about it most places still kos even human, ie halfing clerics who you cant get faction with, so even if the guards leave you alone you still cant run thorugh RV safely. Most citys you can bank in wich is good but most places dont sell to you anyway.<P>Humasn looks pretty cool allround, i played troll and halfings and dark elves to much and got sick of them completely. Human was a GREAT change and a very fun shadowknight to play.<P>Bertoxxulous, the best deity to choose, the more unique as the ideals are not as cliche as innorukks. Plus you have a groovy shrine to worship.<P>Hope that helps any, plus there are not many human sk out there, but when you find them human SK group so well, you know each other weekness and strengths, i played with a human sk (innorukk tohugh) who used piercing and bash to great effect, me with my 2 handed wepon and both out pets took out even and blue con with virtually no down time, as we taped half the damage lost at the end of a fight and when the next spawned we fought and won, we gained a lv in about 3 hrs just the two of us. The point is dont underestimate human sk they are a fun class/race to play and have more advantages than are apparent than first, i did not pick mine for the faction though so i woudlnt worrie about that.<P>Have luck with you human sk and remeber, qeynos sewers it the best place for a newbie shadowknight to lv, you will want to know that area well plus from lv 1 - 8 there are loads of good magic items down there to aid you intial lvs.<P>Golden locket<BR>Thick black cape<BR>Alligator toothe earing<BR>Rusty bastard sword, one of the more elusive rustys wepons in qeynos<BR>Lots to hunt from lv 1 - 15<BR>Cubert for some quest items, golden stud earing +3 int, a pair sells for 80 plat easy but they are worth the price to keep for your self the int will do you will after lv9.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=000532.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=Shadow+Knight|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Prospective+Human+SK">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#D9DCE8">

</FONT><HR>Hi, Delph<P>Maybe I can help you out.  I play a human SK (only level 12, so my advice will be limited) and I definitely have some advice for fellow humans out there.<P>1) First off, everyone is going to want to kill you.  You're pretty safe in Qeynos and North Qeynos, with a few exceptions.  One, is Gash Flockwalker.  He will make your life rough for the first several levels if you run into him.  My suggestion is don't ever go into the Lion's Mane Inn, and at night he takes a little walk from the Inn to the docks (this is in North Q, btw) and stands there for awhile.  Being the fisherman that I was, it was hard not to run into him at times.  It was very rewarding when I reached level 11 or so and was finally able to kill him.<P>Also, if you kill Lashun Novashine too often (which, you want to roleplay a good SK really SHOULD wipe the floor with him when you are of proper level) he will KOS you.  (He's in S Qeynos) which isn't too big of a deal, but his buddy who's name I can't remember just now, will wipe the floor with you.  Be careful at the gates, too, because the guards will join in.<P>2) Your guild is a ***** to find.  It's below the Grounds of Fate.  It's down there with the Necro guild and if you have trouble getting there ask another SK (they'll be rare) or a Necro to help you out.  I was told "follow the path of bones" and that should help you out.  Head below the arena and follow the bones into the lions cages.  You'll again follow the bones into one of the cages and a secret "door" exists on the very right (again, follow the bones).  You'll need that little candle you'll get in the beginning to see becuase it's VERY dark in there.  Upgrade to an LS asap.  It took me an hour of begging to find this place when I first started.<P>3) I'm really not a quest person, so I can't really help you there.  The one quest I did do was to obtain prayer beads from Brothers Estle and Chintle in WK.  They're fairly low level, but you certainly couldn't take them right away.  You might know this already, but if you don't, do NOT kill Brother Trintle.  He's a mole and you will be killed when/if you try to turn in his prayer beads.  You get this quest from the same guy you give your letter in the beginning to.  As for other quests, you might want to look at spoiler sites.  Oh, there is also the quest for returning the cleric's Order of Thunder to Kane Bayle, whom you will alsp speak to in order to obtain that quest.  He explains what you need to do and can occasionally be found down in the guild.  This is the only time he will acknowledge you.  If you speak to him up top he will ignore you.<P>4) When you go through Q Hills, watch it.  Pretty much every NPC here is going to want to ace you.  Don't go near Surefall and watch yourself on the way to Karana and Blackburrow.  About 6 NPS'c roaming around here just waiting to dust you.<P>5) Since you've played a rogue you're probably used to a challenge.  But even with a human, you are going to have a rough time with an SK.  You are going to have so many frustrations and irritations and surprises it will be amazing.  If you can stick with it, and like a good challenge, it will be worth it.  At level 12 I already feel a sense of accomplishment because there are so few human SK's out there and I've been KOS so many times I can't even count anymore.  My last piece of advice is just to be patient and prepare yourself for a challenge.  It's going to be rough.<P>Best of luck and welcome aboard!<P>Sadd<BR>SK of 12 Seasons<BR>Bertoxxulous Server<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=000532.cgi&ReplyNum=000005&forum=Shadow+Knight|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Prospective+Human+SK">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#E8EAF0">

</FONT><HR>Oops..one last bit of advice.  I also gave myself 90 STR thinking that would be plenty, but since SK's can be played by the "big" races, I think they didn't account for the fact that some of us would play humans (I don't even know how Erudites can do it).  But as it stands now with just banded, a 2h sword, shield and mino axe and some food and supplies, I only have room for about 2 or 3 things before I am encumbered.  And that means one or two bronze weapons from bandits.  It's a big pain the butt since I don't have any money for a strength item, so if you want to be able to carry anything, I'd say go for at least 95 STR.  We have the siphon strength spell which helps, but if it wears off and you find yourself running from something and are encumbered, you may as well give up.<P>Or, twink him/her with a STR increasing item.  It's really my biggest SK issue.  Everything is so heavy for us.  I don't even want to know what I'm going to do when/if I am able to get my Darkforge.<P>Okay, take care...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=000532.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=Shadow+Knight|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Prospective+Human+SK">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#D9DCE8">

</FONT><HR>Strength should be relatively easy to increase at lower levels with silver amber rings and rusty spiked shoulderpads and spiked collars, I got all those with my untwinked sk by the time I was level 9.<P>Blackburrow isn't a bad place to get faction with Priests of Life and Knights of Thunder, yet I have to see a reason why I would do such a thing.<P>Bandit sashes make your bloodsabres faction go down, which is sometimes bad, but I usually have my friends buy my spells for me.<P>Humans are rather ok at being shadowknights but I would much rather be an Erudite.  90 str and 117 int isn't too bad to start out with,  right now my str is only 101, 111 with siphon str, and the rest can be made up for with buffs.  <P>Weight shouldn't be much of a concern since you are able to hunt somewhat effectively at lower levels without encumbrance hindering you beyond the point of ineffectiveness.<P>I would replace that Mino Axe with a dwarven axe as quickly as possible.  Dwarven Axes are sufficiently cheap, and have the same damage/delay ratio as the PGT.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=000532.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=Shadow+Knight|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Prospective+Human+SK">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#E8EAF0">

</FONT><HR>I should add that I do, in fact, have a spiked collar which has added three to my strength.

</FONT><HR>Well, I have recently played up to 14th lvl as a human shadow knight on luclin, so I will tell you what I can.  First, I should tell you that I started in Freeport, which may have produced different results, I notice the guys on previous posts saying that Qeynos is a better place for us.  The human SK was my second character.  My first was a DE Necromancer, and for some reason I had a very tough time playing him, dying frequently and not really getting anywhere.  One reason for this was that I had connection problems at some times, and a pet-dependent class is in trouble when going LD frequently.  The SK was good in that he was more of a survivor, and could handle a reversal in fortune without dying immediately.  I also thought that humans got an xp bonus, like so many people, and I continued to believe this for quite some time.  I did lvl much faster than with my DE, but part of that may have been increased skill with the game, as well as figuring out better times to play.  I really liked my character.  I was considered pretty original, though the numbers of human SKs were on the rise at that point, and I started seeing a lot more after hitting 10th or so.  I got into the roleplaying aspect, and had fun being the dark, mysterious warrior at times.  I had one group confused as to what I was for a while, since I had /roleplay on, and was not doing anything in their presence to indicate i had other abilities.  One of them was a member of the good races, and I didn't want to reveal myself.  The other was a dark elf.  The Teir'dal eventually figured it out after spotting me using siphon strength and disease cloud on a creature i was fighting while the others were temporarily elsewhere, or so i thought.  There are definitely fun things about roleplaying this type of character.  They're definitely renegades, liked by few, and not for those who follow the crowd.  However, I chose an even harder road than I had at first suspected.  I don't think the game designers thought that anyone would want to be a human SK, so we don't seem to have much in-game support.  For newbie quests, I did the necromancer quest once or twice, didn't do much for me.  Most other npcs don't like you enough to tell you about quests, and your guildmaster won't give you one.  I found that I could also do monk sash quests for the Ashen Order, found that out when I was just bored and fooling around, that's kind of funny, but not much use.  Money was getting to be a real problem, others of my lvl were running around in metal armor, and wielding magic blades, while I still wore leather, and carried a minotaur axe, and a 2-handed sword for those times when I felt the need.  I also noticed that the ogre and troll SKs I adventured with seemed more powerful than I, as well as better equipped, for the same lvl.  I used more spells, but we are not supposed to rely on magic, being 75% warrior.  I admit it, I was jealous.  The higher lvl I got, the more the differences were pronounced, and the worse time I had soloing creatures that others of my lvl could take easily.  Humans don't have an xp penalty, true, but that means we're underpowered for our lvl, and we have to fight things lower lvl than us, and get less xp.  I know, some of you have done really well despite this, and something that is challenging is not necessarily bad.  However, I have a long history of choosing the hard road, without even meaning to, even from my days of pencil and paper rpgs, and it is getting rather frustrating.  I wouldn't mind being the tough one for a change, I must admit.  And the troll and ogre boys seem to be having the time of their lives roleplaying their characters.  I still like my character, but at the same time I think I got jacked in too many ways for me to continue with it.  Also, I really want to play on a newer server, luclin is starting to get infested by high lvl campers and so forth, like every other place, and it's hard to play alongside them with a relatively young character.  Either you can suck up, and get all kinds of neat things you shouldn't have yet, or you can try to work around them, and be the poor man on the block.  But I digress.  Like I said, there is not as much in-game support implemented for us, so be prepared to do without many of the quests that others take for granted, or items that you can't, as a human, use.  The grobb cleaver thing always ticked me off, sounded like a really cool weapon, but every type of SK OTHER than a human can use it, even the smaller dark elves.  It would make more sense if it had just been restricted to large races.  That's just one example though.  Another would be the armor issue, it's weight seems to be intended more for the strong races, the smaller SKs complain about carrying it, from what I hear.  They will probably come up with more things for this type of character in the future, but as it stands now, it can be really frustrating.  I imagine I will now receive many flames, and be called a wimp, and so forth, for giving up on that, but it simply does not suit me to continue with it.  I have the ability to do so, it's just that I think I'd have more fun trying something else.  You may have more fun as a human, though, yourself, it's a matter of personal preference, not just effectiveness.  I am trying to figure out what I'd have the most fun playing.  The two factors tend to form a compromise of sorts, since being effective is more fun than being disadvantaged compared to others, I can't deny that.  I guess a more superficial gripe I suppose I have is that they make humans look kind of stupid.  I think human SKs should look cooler than they do, rather than looking like the tin man from the wizard of Oz when they get some metal armor,lol.  Not that I had that problem, sigh.  Do what you like, though.  The choice is yours.  There are many options, and many great ideas for characters out there, which is something I like about this game.  The variety is great, with all the different races and classes out there, each with different ways of dealing with things.  Good luck, whatever you choose.<BR>(and sorry about the length and rambling nature of this post, it's late and I'm thinking too much,lol.)<BR>Previously,<BR>Zhanatos<BR>14th lvl Shadow Knight of Innoruuk,<BR>under the command of Pietro Zarn<BR>luclin<P>Now, who knows?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=000532.cgi&ReplyNum=000009&forum=Shadow+Knight|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Prospective+Human+SK">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#E8EAF0">
