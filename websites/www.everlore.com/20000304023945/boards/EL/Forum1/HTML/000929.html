</FONT><HR>I'm a 10th song bard and I'm begining to get bored with EQ and would like your suggestions.  Here's why I am bored.<P>Ever since about level 7 I find the only place I can hunt is Blackburrow and sometimes West Karana.  It's a constant struggle to get to a higher level.  No matter how much I group or solo, the time to level is excruciatingly long.  All I ever do is kill gnoll or the wildlife in WK.  Every day it's the same old thing and is getting very boring.<P>To alleviate this boredom I decided to take on a quest or two, this is EverQUEST afterall.  Oops.  Bad idea.  The only quests I have found are either ones that can be completed by a level 5 (or under) or they are so difficult that you need to be level 20+. In addition, you can travel all the way from Qeynos to S. Karana and back only to receive a miniscule amount of experience.  I think it would be better if you couold gain experience just by traveling (and surviving) with a lower lvl character therough some high level areas  <P>Now I did try what seemed to be a couple mid level quests (the bard lute repair is one) but upun reaching the land where the quest leads you to (South Karana), I found that 95%  of the monsters are WAY above level 10.<P>I also decided it might be a good time to sart going in search of lore items, special weapons, armor, etc.  But again, you have to be way above 20+ to get the items and most locations for the special items are constantly camped.<P>Finally, I've given some serious thought to starting a new character but I'm not interested in killing bats and rats for the next couple weeks.  Again, this is boring.  I want adventure.  I want fun.  I don't wnt to spend another two+ weeks killing rats and bats only to find myself doing the same thing I am now...Killing the same gnolls over and over.<P>So what is there in EQ besides killing the same old foes day in a day out?<P><BR>Thank you,<P>Altorio<p>[This message has been edited by Altorio (edited 11-26-1999).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000929.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=Everlore+Main+Hall&TopicSubject=Why+Is+It+That+EQ+is+Getting+Boring|QUS|++Suggestions+Ayone|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>I don't know if other people have made this suggestion (well... I do know that other people have made this suggestion, rather rudely, I might add...), but try out the RaceWar servers if you're really truly bored with EverQuest the way it is on the non-PvP servers....  I started playing on Vallon Zek a little over a month ago, and I love it!  Never the same thing every day...... I mean, there is still the level-quest idea (I don't think it is possible to remove that from this game....), but you rarely see the same thing everyday.... In the last few weeks, there have been some major "political" changes on the server (that I've noticed...) and who knows what the future will bring!  Every time I log on, it's a new world!  (well....  you know what I mean....)  <P>Please don't take this as another of those "anti-CareBear" plugs, because it's not intended to be one... if you're honestly getting bored with the same old hack'n'slash, try out a PvP server.  I guarantee you won't be bored for much longer.....  <IMG SRC="http://www.everlore.com/boards/EL/wink.gif"><P>Chiron, Ranger of the Grey Companions, Vallon Zek<BR>Inelia, Enchanter of the Grey Companions, Vallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000929.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=Everlore+Main+Hall&TopicSubject=Why+Is+It+That+EQ+is+Getting+Boring|QUS|++Suggestions+Ayone|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>this is what i think<P>ok, i'm no GameMaster but you (original writer of the post) sound like you probably haven't had the game too much, and well, if your in qeynos, hell yea, it's boring as hell, (if you are farely new and haven't seen most of the world) try traveling!!! i no longer play EQ due to lack of time and partly because it is the same old, day in day out crap.  But when i first got EQ i remember like, the first character i had was in qeynos, take the boat to Erudin and stop off at kerra isle, just explore, you can go to freeport....the trip is time consuming and well, the graphics are great and it's just awesome!!!<P>well, i hope you find something to do<P>one suggestion, don't take up a trade skill.....very expensive and very frustrating!!!<P>X-EQ playa</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000929.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=Everlore+Main+Hall&TopicSubject=Why+Is+It+That+EQ+is+Getting+Boring|QUS|++Suggestions+Ayone|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>Travel to a new city. One whose inhabitants will not attack you on sight is preferred.  Qeynos Hills is a very poor place to make experience in my opinion. Travel to Freeport, get bound there, and go hunt with people in East Commonlands and West Commonlands.<P>Being in a group of four to six players is good, because you almost always have something to talk about and there is safety in numbers.  You can take on higher level creatures to get those items you could never get yourself.<P>You could join a guild.<P>Try going to Faydwer.  I have played several characters on Antonica, but never left the continent.  When I went to the zones in Faydwer I was filled with that insatiable need to explore.  The game is as fun as you want it to be.

</FONT><HR>As much as I appreciate all the replies, I think I didn't get the main point across clearly.  Essentially what I feel the problem is, is that mid level characters, say from level 10 through 20, are unable to do any quests, and hence have more fun AND get experience.  The reason is threefold.<P>First, there seems to be only two type of quests.  Those easy, rather meaningless quests that any LOW level character can acomploish with ease.  Such as delivering mail, or doing the inner-city quests.  <P>Secondly, any quest that is tougher is WAY too tough for a mid level (10 to 20) character to do alone.  Yet when the quest is complete (if you do it as a group) only one "prize" or item is the reward.  So where is the incentive for people to group AND go on qujests together?  There is none, from what I have seen.  People group only to go kill monsters and such.  They don't group to go questing, because the reward (for all) isn't there.<P>Thirdly, traveling is, imo, a blast.  I've gone from Qeynos to Freeport and back.  I've gone from Qeynos to South Karana and back.  I've gone from Qeynos to Permafrost and back.  But you don't gain ANY exoperience from travelling, only from killing or questing.<P>Anyway, I'm just frustrated at what is so close to being the perfect RPG, and yet it falls short.  <P>EQ seems to need two more elements.  One, the ability to quest succesfully by yourself (or give multiple "prizes" upon completion of a quest, so everyone is rewarded.  Secodnly, EQ needs to give experience for travelling to "tough" places that are typically far aboove your current level.<P>Just my .02 worth.  I'll get off my soapbox now.    <IMG SRC="http://www.everlore.com/boards/EL/smile.gif"><P><BR>Altorio  <p>[This message has been edited by Altorio (edited 11-26-1999).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000929.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=Everlore+Main+Hall&TopicSubject=Why+Is+It+That+EQ+is+Getting+Boring|QUS|++Suggestions+Ayone|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>There are many quests in Norrath.  In fact, Verant is constantly adding new quests.  You just need to look for them.  Not all quests, definitely not the good ones, have [bracketed information].<P>I only use quests to change my faction for the better.  They are fun, but definitely not something I would consider spending a lot of time on.  I didn't pay for these spells, armor, and weapons so I can run around doing quests.<P>Groups can and often fulfill a quest that results in one item as a reward.  The people simply take turns in receiving the reward so that everyone is satisfied.<P>As for getting experience for simply running from zone to zone.  That's just cheap.  All someone would need to do is cast Invis and run from zone to zone.  Or how about zoning back and forth from zone to zone.  Not a good idea in my opinion, and not something I believe Verant would consider.  See you in Norrath.<P>The soapbox is all yours.<P>Shadowknight of the Unholy Alliance<BR>Servant of Innoruuk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000929.cgi&ReplyNum=000005&forum=Everlore+Main+Hall&TopicSubject=Why+Is+It+That+EQ+is+Getting+Boring|QUS|++Suggestions+Ayone|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>You know I played in BB or Black Burrow for numerous lvls.  Why not get some help and go to Faydwer.  You can kill orcs in crushbone for a change. You can be bound any where in the zone of G Fay almost.  Then after you hit 11 or so head down to Lesser Faydark  and hunt at the bandit and Nybright camps in groups that is.  There is a selling staion in the zone just stay away from the orcs in that zone they would crunch you oh and the brownies they are mean.  Good luck</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000929.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=Everlore+Main+Hall&TopicSubject=Why+Is+It+That+EQ+is+Getting+Boring|QUS|++Suggestions+Ayone|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana"><A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000929&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000929&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
