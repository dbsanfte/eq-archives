				This is where you will arive if you take the raft from Oasis.  The first stop is an island where you transfer to a burned out looking ship in the Timorous Deep.  That ship will bring you to docks in The Overthere.  I've heard that some dark races are KOS to the dragoons here, but I (dark elf shadowknight) did not have any trouble.  There's a bank and some clockwork vendors, who apparently aren't related to the clocks in sol a, up the hill from the docks.  Outside is a large outdoor zone with guards that look like gargoyles.  Most of the MOBs in the zone /con blue to me at 38.  My favorite is the free range chicken looking things.  The Sarnaks are some sort of reptile looking creature that drop a variety of decent loot.  I've also seen Rhinos, which I've heard can run faster than SOW.  I'm looking forward to getting back there tonight...<BR>

				Ok, I have spent a very long time in this zone and know this place very well, and this zone is a strange place indeed.  This post may be long, but I guarentee that the information here will be very helpful to you.  <BR>
First of all, this is the zone that you will enter from the boat taken from the island that you get to from the oasis if you understand that.  This is the DE outpost and I'm almost totally positive that all evil races and classes are accepted here, I am a human SK so that should show you that evil can get here fine.  The outpost is an old Iksar city that has been now taken over by the DE's, if you are a &quot;good&quot; race/class DO NOT come here, I saw a bunch of level 50's get off the boat and didn't even make it past the docks, you will die!  The guards here are very nice and many of them, ranging from some undead Iksar creatures, Dragoons(higher level then Nek), Iron Guardians, some gargoyle creatures, and the new much feared(by all but the evil race/classes) cliff golems, the cliff golems are giant sized clay looking creatures and hit hard and I hear con red to level 50's, there are 2 of them here, one at the east gate, one at the west gate.  In the outpost there are many tinker merchants like the above post stated as well as bankers, I have also found some evil class guilds as well, so everything that you need is here as well as many quests which i still have yet to look into.  One strange event that happens which I still have yet to look into(I couldn't since I was low on health or going to get corpse) is that every so often about 5 or 6 Dragoon guards walk out of the West tunnel out of the outpost and just walk straight into the zone, I am wondering what they do, I will find this out soon.  Oh, and I forgot to mention that this zone is bindable for non-binding classes.<BR>
Now for the rest of the zone, here is the tricky part, there is a massive canyon in the center of the zone which has things in it, I looked and saw a scorpian thingy, didn't look into it too much.  But this is important, everything on the EAST side of the canyon is in the low 20's level range, while everything on the WEST side of the canyon is level 35 to 40 range, this is strange because on both sides there are the same creatures, just different levels, and also things tend to agro you on the west side that wouldn't on the east side, so watch yourselfs.  On the west side is where the path starts from the outpost, follow this path and to the right before the fork you will see some Iksar statues, I hear it is a zone there, but I need to still check that out.  Keep going on the path to the fork, take that right fork and that will lead you to the Frontier Mountains (path ends, go up hill, you will see it).  If you take the left fork then that will bring you around to the Warslik Woods(path ends, keep going straight and to the right a little), also right by this zone is a huge Iksar statue you can't miss it, even in the rain that falls often in this zone.<BR>
To the far east side of the zone somewhat in the middle are ruins holding about 5 or 6 Sartechs?(forgot what spelled like).  These guys are around levels 35 to 40, and they are NOT spaced out well to pull, found this out the hard way and my friend died very fast.  From what I remember there were Sartech? Berzerkers and two other kinds forget the names, but the Berzerkers are part of a quest in the outpost, something about getting thier warbeads or something, oh and killing Sartechs? will raise your faction with the Iksar.<BR>
This land by the way is like a barren wasteland and seems to go on for a long time since the zone is so huge.  Along the path you will also find some other interesting ruines of such, and the land gets bumpy at points, thanks to the new 3D engine :), so watch youself while traveling since I've found that things like to jump you out of nowhere.  I also find that this zone is great for me to solo in, yesterday when it first opened the loot was great (1 to 2.3p a loot) but I think that they changed that :(.  Thats all I can think to say about this zone now, I will post more if I find out anything.<BR>

				I made the trip from Oasis to the Field of Bones tonight. It was long and scary but here's how I did it....<BR>
<BR>
Take little boat from Oasis pier. It lands on an island with Ogres on it. They have odd names and you'll see what I mean when you get there. I've never killed an Ogre in my life but I was still surprised when they were indifferent to me. Get off the boat and go straight and to the right.<BR>
<BR>
There are two piers on the other side of the island. Go to the righthand one. Wait until the ugliest boat you have ever seen stops there. It's actually a wreck strapped to a barge. hahaha. Doesn't look real safe but it will get you there. Along the trip you will see two things that may interest you. One is a pile of shipwrecks floating off your left. The other is a small island on the right with some type of fortification on it.<BR>
<BR>
When you zone into Outland you will see a large white wall on your left. If you are good you might want to jump off here. Swim around it to the left.<BR>
<BR>
One you hit the sandy shore run left for a very long time. Eventually you cant run left any more so now you angle right running higher and higher. When you see the giant statue of the Iksar you know you are close. Things of interest to me during this run were the sabertooth tigers and the rhinos.<BR>
<BR>
Keep going until you see a road curving into the mountain that you are running along. At the top of the mountain above this road is the zone. 20, -3798, 176. You zone into Warsilks Woods. Be careful!!! This place has tons of aggressive monsters and I actually fought and killed a small big headed giant here. Scary.<BR>
<BR>
Now, this is sort of hard to describe but there are trees everywhere. It is hard to see and hard to go around dangers that you cannot see. Go left and hug the edge of the woods. You will go for a long time. Scattered amoungst the woods are old buildings and numerous goblins that look really cool. Watch out for them! Eventually you will come to water. Swim as far left as you can go. I think it is safe as I saw no danger at all while I swam. Eventually you come to the North side of the Woods and a huge cliff. Climb the cliff and go left again. You circle back to the right and are now eading SouthEast. Follow the left wall East then SouthEast then East then North then East and you will zone at 1638, -3933, 19 into the Field of Bones.<BR>
<BR>
Once in the field of bones stay left. I thought it was very cool that there is more water on that side, a small island with a King Kong lookalike and two secret entrances into the ground. One leads to mauraders, the other leads somewhere else. I couldn't make it into the second one as I just wasn't up to the challange. Properly prepared and enspelled and I'm sure I would have no problem. Let me put it this way, the level 1 Iksar has a better chance of making it than I do, and I'm level 31.<BR>
<BR>
Oh, one last thing... if you go South East from the Field of Bones you eventually get to the Emerald Forest. -1809, -1192, 21.

				My two cents on the zone. The Sarnak come in the following types, in approximate order of level: Flunkie, Conscript, Knight, Berserker, and Gem Oracle. The last I have seen only at the center of the rest of the Sarnak in the east ruins, sounds like a good target for some higher-ups looking for something to loot. The quest given out by the captain of the undead marines is to retrieve 4 Sarnak Berserker battle braids. Turn them in for change and faction. I've also found two types of common lore items, a sabretooth tiger mane and a stoneglint cockatrice feather (+1 cha earring). I don't see any use for them, so they may be quest items. The loot was definitely better on the first day, I'm getting much less now. As for the chasm, it is filled with Scorpiniks, half-Iksar half-scorpion beings that look awesome and are indifferent (to a DE SK). There are 4 crypts in the chasm filled solely with these creatures, I've found nothing in them, though I've heard there is a red orb that is a teleporter to another zone somewhere in there.

				I went there with my Erudite Mage and was safe from the guards and merchants. They were apprehensive to me at the worst. One note...I am agnostic.<BR>
<BR>
You are ok when in the ruined city...it is great that you can bind melees there inside. You can also drag stuff to the gargoyle gaurds...but it takes a while for them to kill some of the mobs...so watch out.<BR>
<BR>
I am lvl 33 and was fighting a Sabertooth Tiger with a lvl 40 SK...that tiger killed the SK, and almost killed me before the gaurds killed it. <BR>
<BR>
Pleant of things top kill here...Sarnaks, Cocks, Sabertooth Tigers and Tigresses, Rhinos, these Tree-looking things, and I don't recall the rest...and this is just outside the city walls! The level range has to be 30 to at least 45 for this zone.

				 You may think that the name &quot;The Overthere&quot; is a strange name for a zone. Well, there is a very good reason it was named this, which I am gonna explain, like it or not.<BR>
<BR>
 Many, many uneeded patches ago, there was a small group of travelers who happened upon a large, unknown island. Now, they may have been good travelors, but they obviously didn't know much about wild animals. As soon as the group got off their shiny, Gnomish boat, the dwarf shouted &quot;Look over there!&quot; But, the wood elf didn't notice, because he had spent his entire life in a tree, and thus, had lost all his hearing (Don't ask why, it doesn't affect the story). The Halfing didn't notice, because he was fishing. But, the Barbarion DID notice. He just didn't care. You see, the freakishly tall Barbarion felt racist agianst the poor, short Dwarf, and could care less about what happend to him. (Or the Halfling for that matter)<BR>
 <BR>
Anyway, the Dwarf was instantly gobbled up by a hungry tiger, who then ate the the Halfling and the Elf. But the Barbarion tamed him, and because he didn't like newbies either, he brought the tiger back to Freeport and let him loose on lotsa newbies. <BR>
<BR>
And that is why this place is called &quot;The Overthere&quot;<BR>

				I entered RoK first time today and spent some time in the Plains East of the Dark Elven Outpost.<BR>
<BR>
I fought the following mob's and am a lvl 23 DE/SK:<BR>
<BR>
Kunark Rhinos - conned all blue except 1 red<BR>

<BR>
all these beasts are not casting and except of the Sarnaks not aggroing to me. loot was usually cash (5 gp to 2 plat i'd say), got no special or quest items.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
keep in mind that i mostly hunted East of the Outpost, when I left the Outpost in Southern Direction most mob's conned red to me.<BR>
<BR>
the loc of the Crater Entrance (with the Scorpikis - red to me, appr.) is neg 1409, neg 1390, neg 49<BR>
<BR>
the bank's loc is 2687, 2139, neg 49,97<BR>
<BR>

I went to a skeletton at the Docks (where they build the new ships) and hail'd him (he's called &quot;Undead Foreman&quot;) and he told me that he's looking for new Workers, I said that I'd be a &quot;new Worker&quot; but he rejected, i guess because of my faction, only appr., don't know where that leads to...<BR>
<BR>
Thats all for now, good hunting all  :)
