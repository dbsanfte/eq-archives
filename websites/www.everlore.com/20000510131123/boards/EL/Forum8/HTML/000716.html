</FONT><HR>Hey!  I've been running a wizard for about half a year now, and am really tired of soloing.  I was thinking about an Eru Necro, but heard that the class isn't really designed for grouping, and that some punks are trying to nerf the class (which I think really sucks--why should the necroes be punished for someone else's inability to strategize & play smart, when the majority of the necroes actually know how to play their class instead of getting jealous and pissy?  Besides, they're allowed to be jerks;  they're necroes).  There's also the thing about a new area for necroes near Erudin, which is cool, but I haven't found much word of their use on the planes.<P>So should I just go for an Enchanter, or is a Necro very useful in group situations?  You tell me.<P>Oh, and God save the Necroes from nerfing.  It's not their fault they RP well.<P>-------------------<P>The girl who's been crushed in dueling with necroes before, yet never seen their prowess in group situations...<P>Brandiwyne Ruhmanjin<BR>"You call her name to liquor"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=8&topic=000716.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=Necromancer|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Necroes,+Groups,+Nerfing,+and+the+Planes">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#D9DCE8">

</FONT><HR>Necros aren't very valuable in groups unless you're in undead infested dungeons like befallen, unrest, or lower guk. In these areas, necros are just as valuable as clerics, if not more so since they can charm undead (which clerics can't). <P>Most of the time a necro will spend soloing or partnering. The reason groups don't want them (except at 24 - 28 when they get shock of poison ) is that their damage is dealt with DoT's, which just take too long to kill the mob.<P>Since a necro solos often, this creates a problem in plane runs and dragon runs. If your necro is your primary/only character, you'll have to learn how to group as a caster before you'll be accepted as one (ie no chain nuking, knowing when to cast what, etc.) However, I've brought a wizard and warrior both past 20, so I knew how to group with a pure caster. <P>If you want to be a very group oriented class that is also very fun, be an enchanter. They suck at lower levels, and you'll have trouble getting in a group until level 12 to 16. However, past level 20, any group worth its while will have an enchanter. They deal relatively little damage, but they can easily turn a bad pull into a cake walk (ie "oops I pulled all 5 specs" enchanter says "np I'll charm one and mez the rest"). Just one side note: a level 50 enchanter is the only class, besides possibly a necro, that can solo spectre island in oasis.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=8&topic=000716.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=Necromancer|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Necroes,+Groups,+Nerfing,+and+the+Planes">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#D9DCE8">

</FONT><HR>Actualy it all depends on the person at the keyboard.  I personaly am a favroit in many groups.  True, a cleric will ALWAYS be picked over me, but hey, I can solo and wait if I am really bored and want to group.  Anyway if played right, necros are valuable in group situations.  One or two dots from me saves the tanks from getting beat down, which saves the cleric mana, which saves the nuker mana.  It is kinda complicated to play a necro in a group, but once you learn, you can be a valuable person and make alot of people's friends list.  Which is important to do if you want to go to the planes.  We may be pretty damn powerful, but not powerful enough to solo in Fear, Hate, or Sky heheh.  <P>------------------<BR>Foolish Mortal, You shall DIE!!!<P>Kill my pet!!!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=8&topic=000716.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=Necromancer|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Necroes,+Groups,+Nerfing,+and+the+Planes">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#E8EAF0">

</FONT><HR>Hi there fellow Children of Evil  <IMG SRC="http://www.everlore.com/boards/EL/smile.gif"><P>I have been a necro for over a year now - and level 50 for way too long (not saying to show off - but to show I have played through "nerfs")- and in that time I can tell you that Necros are amazing in groups. <P>A solo necro is fine. You can read while you solo - get exp etc... but a solo necro is VERY different to a group necro. The spells used, when to cast, and how to interact with others in a dynamic situation are very different. Yes, you can solo to 50 - but do you really want to?<P>Group necros that are GOOD group necros were once very rare - but becoming more common as more and more of the solo'ers hit 50 - go to the planes, dragons etc - and find that they have to relearn their class to some extent. I pretty much grouped my way to 50 - I played for the social aspect rather than just exp camping - and I did have to adjust my play style almost constantly depending on level, the group content, and the baddie... but I do think that such experience made me a better group player for that tough times that you can meet in the planes.<P>Luaxana has a REALLY good point! Say, I am in the following group killing non-dead critters - Warrior, Chanter, Ranger, Cleric, Bard and Necro (me). My pet double hits for 55's (so on average around 80+ dmg a tic), in comes Asy (500dmg and debuff - making it easier to be hit by melees and pet), I cast BoD (800dmg - hp to me), I pact Warrior and Ranger (saves cleric mana), and I cast IBlood (1.2k dmg). This ALL adds up. A necro in a group - at any level - cuts down the time of a fight dramitically. At higher levels they can play cleric (I have kept 4 tanks alive with pacting - oh wait that was pre-nerf I think  <IMG SRC="http://www.everlore.com/boards/EL/smile.gif"> I know I can do three now on sea fury clops)<P>What I am trying to say is that, in a group, a necro is even more powerful than alone. (Two necros have saved a group of 16 people from an 8+ plane train death - by pets, BOD, Lich and Covetous Mana.)<P>Sure - there have been some changes to the necro classes - some great - some not so great - but all of them make the class MUCH more interesting to play. I for one, do not want to play a dull super hero  <IMG SRC="http://www.everlore.com/boards/EL/smile.gif">.<P>Toodles.<P>------------------<BR>Paschen du Pays Sombre. <BR>Daughter of Night and Queen of the DarkLands on Xenogy. <BR>~It's our time now - the truth will set you free~</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=8&topic=000716.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=Necromancer|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Necroes,+Groups,+Nerfing,+and+the+Planes">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#D9DCE8">

</FONT><HR>Well, to the unbelievers Paschen is right on target!  I have come across many a Necro who has never grouped and when they do - LOL they use their soloing tactics.  Suffice to say, the group doesnt want to chase a feared creature down, or waste mana on similiar DOTS (heart flutter vs enchanters choke series).  A necro that knows how to group and solo is much more deadly than a one dimenisional player.<P>Lastly, Paschen is right nothing makes me grin more evilly than saving everyone with compact, pet, lich, etc. after the clerics are OOM and the tanks almost dead!  A Necro and an enchanter in the same group can clean-up the "left overs" after everyone else is exhasted and almost dead!<P>Sarasate</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=8&topic=000716.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=Necromancer|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Necroes,+Groups,+Nerfing,+and+the+Planes">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#D9DCE8">

</FONT><HR>Comment to ektar, I have seen a lvl 39 bard solo the specter island in oasis.<P>As for Brandiwyne's question, Erudite Necros are cool.  There starting area in Painelle is probably (in my oppinion) one of the best from lvl 1-5.  Also once "the hole" opens up, it will be nice to have a good home base near by.<P>Necro's can group quite effectively.  Unlike other classes they can play quite a number of roles in a fight.  They may not be as good as an enchanter in strictly group play, but they are still fairly powerful.  Also, if you cant find a group for some reason, you can allways solo, which is something an enchanter has a much harder time doing.  <P>Look through some of the spells that necros get (on eq caster) and there is usually some good stratagies on how to use them.  I also saw a necro's guide to grouping some where that had good stratagies from low lvl all the way to dragon/plane raids.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=8&topic=000716.cgi&ReplyNum=000008&forum=Necromancer|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Necroes,+Groups,+Nerfing,+and+the+Planes">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#D9DCE8">

</FONT><HR>necros are VERY good in groups, but only if you play smart, but nobody knows that, and only a few necros actually know how to group well... if you are smart, a necro can be one of the better classes to add to a group in allmost any situation...<P>but....<BR>enchanters are also very good in groups, especially in dungions, where necros aren't quite as proficient... unless in an undead dungion...<P>I could give you a good tactics for any grouping combination/situation you could think of with a necro...<P>some of my favorites are 2 necros and a shamen... fear kiteing, with practically no downtime (also works with druid)<P>wizard and necro rule, just use your normal soloing tactics, (not fear kiteing) and just have the wizard burn some, your DOTs should keep the mob aggroed to you, so you just run around in circles, and let the mob have it with your DOTs, pet, and Wiz's nukes...<P>but if you really want to group alot, I would sudgest an enchanter, purely for their reputation for grouping, and what they can bring...<P>but if you have a good guild, a necro can be just as good, as long as you make a reputation...<P>	-Rolen</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=8&topic=000716.cgi&ReplyNum=000010&forum=Necromancer|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Necroes,+Groups,+Nerfing,+and+the+Planes">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#D9DCE8">
