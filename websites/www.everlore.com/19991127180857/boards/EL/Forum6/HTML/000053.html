</FONT><HR>Hiya Xavius here...<P>I have tried a few characters and amongst them I found a Human Druid was most entertaining... however I realised quite soon (7th Circle) that it wasnt the best choice of Race to play a Druid... I have just started another Druid as a Woodelf this time and for my starting points I decided that I would spend 5 points in Strength to help carry stuff and the rest went into Wisdom (115 base now I think) was this wise? can anyone comment please...?<P>Also, I think Woodelf is better than Halfling for the starting character as money for newbie druids is an issue... they need armour weapons and spells!! and as Faydark spawns skellies with weapons at the lower levels it is easier to get some decent starting money together than it is in Rivervale where you are stuck with Firebeetles and Klaknak's with rats, snakes, spiders and wolves (which you shouldnt hunt but that is another matter).<P>I find myself babbling once more I offer my apologies... anyway one more quick question then I will await your words of wisdom...<P>GUILDS! How in blazes do I join a guild? I am level 3 and want to get more involved in the roleplaying side of this character (like I have in my others) and would love to be part of a group/guild of people that I can help and assist and be recognised as being a helper... can anyone send me some advice or invite?<P>Thank you one and all for your patience and assistance...<P>Yours Friend Always,<BR>Xavius<BR>Bertoxxulous server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=6&topic=000053.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=Druids+Forum&TopicSubject=Druidic+Wisdom">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>Who cares about carry wait as a druid once you get teleports you can bind at fight spot then sell at druid ruines where you teleport.agility would help you get hit less, staminia gives more hp, dex helps with special effects going off more with items and charisma helps selling, buying and less resists to spells.I and my friends have experimented with these strength only lets you be able to loot more before sell not help in a fight.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=6&topic=000053.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=Druids+Forum&TopicSubject=Druidic+Wisdom">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>Well he is right after awhile you really don't get in close to fight with druid and str is a waste of time. I put stuff in str when I started too. I found I made a big mistake had to start over.After I reached 20th I found I don't even have to get close. I blow them up from far away. Even at 15th I didn't fight up close much. I was in group most of time I healed and blew things up with magic. Don't look at ranks before 14th as anyway to make your char. better to think above 14th and you will see it helps alot more.Well have fun and enough your druid for we are the best and the wisest. =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=6&topic=000053.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=Druids+Forum&TopicSubject=Druidic+Wisdom">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>    As a mid level druid I have found out several things for certain. <BR>    A: Druid are made to solo primarily, and always play a secondary role in groups. This is obvious to those who see that only a small portion of the buff spells accessable to druids are group compatable. Besides, roleplaying a druid the way I do requires me to be of in the Hinterlands insuring the easiest access possible for others.<BR>    B: Druids are part warrior, part healer, and part animal tamer. If you spend all of your points on Wisdom you have limited yourself to the role of spellcaster. Granted your Mana will be formidable, as will be your consistancy. But with the right weapons, (i.e. Screaming Mace, Staff of the Observers, Bloodforge Hammer, etc.) and the right buffs,(i.e SoE,SoT,TC,FF,Sow,SLR, etc.) you can become an effective fighter. At least to those conning white, with the occasional yellow. Now add in Summon Swarm, or Creeping Crud. Its all in the application I think. Dont forget your charmed friend either!<BR>    C: Level advancement is as hard as you make it. Scouting out areas in LF and BB enabled me to ascend through the ranks in terms of hours instead of days. The liberal use of Harmony made places like overfilled Orc camps and haunted Shrines the best place to solo. I would still lend my hand to groups, but it is never the source of experience soloing is. I join groups because even a confident druid sometimes needs companions around the campsite.<BR>  I leave you, my fellows with this:<P>  I have licked the collected teardrops<BR>  of the mountains from sparkling ponds;<BR>  appeased my hunger for warm flesh by<BR>  slaying the quarry of the fields.<BR>  I have drawn other life within me,<BR>  that I may have life, precious life.<BR>  For this, the One has made me, as I am.<P>  Gegladariel, humble servant of Tunare.<BR> <BR>    <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=6&topic=000053.cgi&ReplyNum=000005&forum=Druids+Forum&TopicSubject=Druidic+Wisdom">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>Well some might call it a mistake, but I only raised my wis to 100. My agility is also 100. And I get missed alot, I added nothing to strenght or dexterity, stamina is 80 int 80, and cha 80. <BR>   I know I won't have as much manna, but getting missed and being able to stay alive  longer, seems to me to be about the same as doing more dam with spells while taking more dammage. I know This wouldn't work as well with  npc spelcasting types, but I wanted a more rounded character. I am only 5th lev now, but I seem to be having a much easier time than my 5th lev ranger did. <BR>Tall me what you think. I don't want to start over just to have more manna. Pro's and cons on this? </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=6&topic=000053.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=Druids+Forum&TopicSubject=Druidic+Wisdom">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>At first, I really was getting bored with my Druid.  You try to solo to gain some levels, but the reward is low and risk high.  Plus, you have to med so long at these low levels to make sure you have enough mana for those nasties that just will not seem to drop.  Guess what, we do not get Meditate till later.  What a bummer.  This made my life tough at low level.<P>Until you get to level 9, life is tough. When you get to 9, you can solo more effectively and live.  Levels start to fly by and the rewards are high.  You can not be a very effective fighter as well as caster.<P>I myself gave my character a little Strength and Agility and put the rest in Wisdom.  Lets face it, you have to melee at low levels to survive.  You have to occasionally at high levels as well.  Sometime you get jumped when you just have the mana to get away.  The Agility will help you get missed more and the Strength will allow you to max your damage.<P>Lastly, the life creed of a druid is to be in harmony with nature.  This does not mean that you walk around not hugging trees and all things natural.  It means that you respect nature.  You protect the weak as well as the strong because all things are necessary to be in balance.  Druids kill animals when necessary for survival and to keep nature in balance.  Too much of anything is bad.  We are more comfortable in the woods roaming around than in cities.  We prefer to be in the company of our brother and sister druids as well as rangers.  Since we are lovers of nature it only follows that Wood Elves are the best class to take if you choose, if not in reality then at least in spirit.  We prefer to work alone than with groups.  That is why we are the optimal solo class.<P>With all this said, this does not mean that you have to be everything as said above to be a successful druid in game or in spirit.  It just means that there is no perfect path.  Do what makes you feel comfortable and live with the consequences and challenges that you set forth.  Not adding to your Wisdom and adding to your Strength and Agility only hurts you in the middle levels.  That is what magic items are good for.  Open your pocketbook and buy some Wisdom enhancing items to make up for that deficiency.  Soon you will be as effective as any other Druid who maxed their Wisdom with your spells and possibly a good attacker as well.<P>Good luck.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=6&topic=000053.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=Druids+Forum&TopicSubject=Druidic+Wisdom">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana"><A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum6&number=6&thisthread=000053&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum6&number=6&thisthread=000053&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
