We look like a bunch of goons in hobo clothes.  Monks also know the feeling of being limited to leather...we just don't look cool.<P>I am a level 24 wood elf druid.<P>I thought my tree-embroidered brown suit was cool for a while, but it sure got old fast.<P>Realizing this I had set out to get a suit of chain.  This would be really, really cool.  People would think I was a ranger at first glance!  I would look different from every other druid!  People would know me as the druid in metal!<P>Very excited, I began contacting other druids to compile a list of chain items that I could wear, so that I could begin obtaining them.  <P>Some of the items were very good:<P>Head - Runed Circlet.  4AC 4wis/int.<P>Wrists - Chipped Bone Bracelet.  4AC 5wis.<P>Feet - Dwarven Work Boots.  8AC 3str 5dex.<P><BR>Some of the items were mediocre:<P>Arms - Bone Armplates. 5AC +5str -4dex.<P>Legs - Bone Leggings.  6AC +5sta -4agi.<P>I was willing to make these sacrifices and wear them, for the sake of looking cool. (I'm a superficial guy, what can I say?)<P>This leaves out a couple visible slots:<P>Hands - I'm told that there are indeed some griffon-talon gloves out there that are chain look and druid-wearable.  The gloves are nothing too special (4ac 2dex I think) but are extremely rare and something I probably would never obtain.  I was willing to wear leather gloves anyway since chain gloves on a wood elf look like bare hands with chain on the back, behind the knuckles, and leather looks appropriate even with a suit of chain.<P>Chest - Nothing!   The most important slot and there's NOTHING OUT THERE.  Nothing besides vermiculated chain, which is from the plane of fear and no drop.  I have no hope of getting this.  And if I did get it, it's tinted green and looks stupid with the wood elf two-tone chain.<P><BR>Picturing what I would look like with all chain except a leather chestpiece, you could imagine my disappointment to learn that verant had implemented druid chain for all visible slots but one.<P><BR>I really  like the look of full chain, especially on wood elves, and I think that it should be a viable look for druids who are so inclined.  As such, I have asked verant to implement some form of chain tunic wearable by druids.  Be it in the form of a new item, or an old item converted to chain-look, I feel it is a reasonable request, as there exists such a piece for every other visible slot.  It would be nice if it were a good item, but I would wear it even if it were AC 1.<P>If you agree with me, please post your opinion here as well as performing a /feedback in everquest and letting verant know how you feel.  (I have)<P>If you want to add to what I have said, please share your opinion in this forum.<P>If you disagree with me, I would love to hear a counterargument (I haven't heard one yet.)<P>-Kline, Povar server.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#ffffff"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Tunarian</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Man I couldnt agree more.. Right now im wearing Jaded Electrum Bracelets on both wrists, Jaded Rings on my fingers, a Black Medallion around my neck and a Halo of Light on my head. I wear the halo of light cuz it looks cooler when someone inspects me to see an item called halo of light instead of "leather skull cap" its the same AC as leather cap and it gives a light equal to greater lightstone. I am also wearing snakeskin jerkin snakeskin gloves and mask, the rest is leather. With the bracelets and the halo of light, it looks like im wearing nothing on my wrists and nothing on my head.. im sick of looking green, id rather be naked right now.. and by the way, where can i find the bone armor with the chain look?

There is however a chief Goonda who cons very red and is at least level 34 as he can summon wolves.  <P>Chipped bone bracelets (not to be confused with polished bone, which comes from evil eyes.) are the best for us druids, though there are bone armplates and leggings, and a sheer bone mask, which is a +int item.

I will be in cloth look armor until level 20 or 30 at least. Because of the weight of leather, monk armor goes cloth-netted-woven-mesh------various magical items-POF armor.<BR>Even the quest headbands and sashes don't show up. That is sad. The monk only items that you have to work for don't even appear (that and the fact that the one obtainable at level 25 is like +3hp+3dex...not very attractive).</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#ffffff"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Kinidal</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">leather, leather, leather. thats all i have.

PLATE!  YES!  that's 2 items that look like plate!<P>Actually, Having plate look specifically isn't so important to me, as much as getting something besides the leather look.  SOmething to be unique.  Of course, by the time we can start getting the non-leather looking items, we're all baying at the moon anyway and it doesn't matter.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#ffffff"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Anon.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">You people are thinking like powergamers.  Oh! Oh! Somebody can do something that I can't!  This is the basis of BALANCE in EQ.  If Verant was to give all of the good armor and weapon options to druids, what would separate them from the mage-tanks of UO?  I personally am willing to make the sacrifice because this limit on armor is based on the background and beliefs that should be expressed by druids.  It is justified.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#ffffff"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Kline</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Several of you have misread this.  Read it more carefully.  I'm not griping about how my AC is so low because I can't wear ringmail or plate.  I'm griping because I don't look cool.<P>However, my gripes may be over because I have learned of an item called the werewolf-hide jerkin which may be chain-look. (Lupine gauntlets are chain-look and obtained in the same manner.)  <P>Which adds something else to the string:  If you have seen a werewolf-hide jerkin, and know whether its leather or chain look, PLEASE post it.  If it is, I'm gonna get one and complete my collection of druid-chain and look damn awesome!</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#ffffff"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Taibiuos</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">I hate that we druids all look the same except those who are really high lvls.

If your #1 priority in the game is to *look cool* then you are missing out on alot of really great aspects. Who cares if you have platemail or leather, when a HG steps on ye, you'll be just as dead as the next guy. Try making the game more interesting for yourself and don't focus so much on all the things you don't have. Druids have got to be the best class in the game as far as being well balanced and havign the best of all the other classes. We can cast, we can melee, we can tank, we can heal, we can do it all. Join a guild, roleplay more, challenge yourself with a high level quest. Stop worrying so much about what you look like since its not that important in the overall scheme of things.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#ffffff"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Dagmar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">You shouldn't worry about what you look like as soon as you hit 24th you can turn into a wolf and then you look like a bad ass.  I was turned into a wolf last night on the karana server since I have bone armplates I was solid I looked really cool it was fun.  I am a level 16 druid and if you have metal looking armor you will be solid like I was.

I'm online to hang out with my buds and have adventures in far-away lands.  I AM in a guild, and I DO roleplay, but I wanted the unique armor to add to my roleplaying...isn't roleplaying all about being unique?  I wanted the name Kline Metalclad, and I was going to fight with a Scimitar and a charred shield, and play as a mysterious woodsman with great tragedy in his past...who had forsaken the leather and staff for more "practical" gear and now kills animals despite his trade.  <P>And if trying to get a full suit of druid chain isn't a high level quest than I don't know what is.  I already have the runed circlet...and I didn't buy it either...I actually went to permafrost and got it off the preacher.  <P>Also, I do think that we are the best class in the game, but if you think we can melee OR tank you haven't played past level 20.  I'm level 26 now, and if I'm out of mana I'm more useful to the group medding through a fight than whacking the monster with my staff.  <P>Anyway, I'm sorry to reply so sharply, I know we have our own opinions, but many things in that post are just wrong.  <P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#ffffff"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Kline</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">The above post is in response to Tinina's post, not Dagmar's.
