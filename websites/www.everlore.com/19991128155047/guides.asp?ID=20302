<!--<tr><td><font face="verdana">You guessed it I am L24 so my guide is based upon my experience up until this point. Lets start off with race. Of course the obvious choice stat wise is High Elf.... what not a dwarf?? you say? nope High elf they have the most wisdom which means the most base mana. But stats aside be the race you are most comfortable with.
The newbie levels-
L1-5 Hunt in Greater faydark the game is plentiful and with your combination of healing and damage magic there are few classes as effective as a cleric in the early stages. Solo dont group in these levels. These are your training levels for 1h and 2h blunt as well as evocation and alteration and abjuration. I stayed in the newbie field until I reached 5, sure from L4-5 is a long process but you improve your melee skills so much it is worth it to get that good foundation. Plus with all the extra kills means more loot and believe me coin gets very tight after you start realizing I have to buy armor AND spells argghhh!!!
Buy your much needed L5 spells you should have accumulated enough for all your spells and at least patch work armor. The spells for L5 run you about 4 plat for all 10 a little more and patchwork will run you aboout another 2 so 6 plat in 5 levels is very realistic. The most important ones at L5 are light healing,holy armor, gate, and furor. Buy the others as you have the coin if you are short. Ward Undead is really not needed right now as you do not have meditate. One other note on the beginning levels practice divination with Sense magic early and often it pays off later, I will gfet to that.
L5-9 the infant levels
ok so you have some better spells and some armor ready to kick some arse and group..... blah not yet no need to group. Take advantage of the ability to solo while you can because it gets increasingly harder to do so later on. Another reason to solo is you have to worry of only you and you dont get meditate. If you group you will have to heal and end up with huge downtime. From L5-8 can seem like the longest levels of a clerics career all the more reason to be selfish and solo to get this p[eriod done with as soon as possible. Go to Butcherblock mountains and kill Large snakes. thesae creatures are great for expereince and relatively low on the damage you take. this should get you to 6 pretty easy. Now it is time to buy that ward undead spell. Use it sparringly though only at full mana or big downtimes incur. I would still concentrate on large snakes and blue goblins for the bulk of your exp with the occassional Dwarf skel to give that nice noticeable jump to keep you motivated. L7 woo hoo one more level til meditate. Kill goblins and large snakes and seek more dwarf skels and just keep consistent should be to 8 in no time. once you make L8 you have made your first milestone MEDITATE things mana wise will be sooo much better. group now? nah dwarf skels all the way kill them til you DING and go buy your new spells. Center, Fear, Hammer of wrath, Summon food, root and soothe are the most important here. If you have the coin buy word of pain but I dont recommend the use until L10 as it is very mana intensive and you tend to fail alot on spells in that round.
L10-14 the early teens 
Group Now? Oh yeah and how!!
Find yourself some goos pets (tanks) heh and go to work in CB. Start in the slaver houses out back and to the tents where Legionairre sometimes spawn. Group of 3 or 4 is perfect and make you get a tank that can taunt because the ocrs being semi intelligent know a good healer and want to take you out so make sure they know to taunt from you so you can keep them alive. You are still a VIABLE part of the melee still at these levels so mix it up and cast heal only when needed do try to keep everyone topped let them tanka  bit and keep all your tanks buffed at all times, AT ALL TIMES.
Stay in CB until 14. Great loot and very good expereince. Save every copper you get because this is perhaps the most trying time for a cleric, banded armor is now needed and those L14 spells are going to cost you a pretty platinum so always save and dont try any trade skills or any extra curricular activities. L14 woo hoo another milestone bind healing EXPULSE undead, Smite and another great buff Symbal of transal.
L14-19 the late teens almost there to full priesthood
these levels are very tough for where to fight? well CB can get boring and you can travel now so I suggest two great places, Steamfont mountains where the game in limitless it seems and even though they con blue taking them out one after another after another adds up quick, or go to Befallen and repeatedly kill the shadowknights and greater skels. Make sure you have a good group with good tanks and dont overdo it on the expulse heh.
Once you hit 19 you get some great upgrades to buffs but more so Holy might is now a valuble spell unlike stun use it to prevent damage and now you are ready for Mistmoore with a FULL group! Let me say that again FULL GROUP and hopefully with tanks 1 or 2 levels higher than you to take more punishment. that place is very good for experience just watch for Graveyard trains and not to pull to many. For those that are saying what are all these places? As you progress you will hear of these places and venture there then you will know or just ask around. L24 ahh another milestone a huge heal and a great DD to undead another great upgrade to a buff as well as a kick arse Symbal (but spendy) Unrest is definetly the place for you. As you enter zone type "/ooc L24 cleric looking for a group" and my screen goes purple with tells. Now from L19 on is where your shift in battle begins to change. No longer are as effective in battle as the tanks. Rangers get dual and double and warriors had it long ago and paladin get double at 20 while you swing your 8 damage mace. time to control crowds Damage through casting when appropriate and HEAL and buff. Remember dont draw attention the mobs hit MUCH HARDER now and if you draw attention too early in the fight you will have to wait for the taunts and may end up using mana on yourself which could of better been used on your tanks. Remember you are a support player in battle, but not many groups will go into battle without a good cleric backing them. Man am I rambling I will end it here with this final statement, No one takes it upon themseleves so much to keep the group alive than the cleric this is my view but I will do everything possible and play the best way to ensure my group is alive and well and able to say good job what a fight when everyone is under 2 bubbles of health and the exp and loot is great. Good luck to all the aspiring cleric and look me up on Brell server and we can talk</font></td></tr>-->
