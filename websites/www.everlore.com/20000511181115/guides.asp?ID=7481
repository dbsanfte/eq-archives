<!--<tr><td><font face="verdana">Hi this is Anarion and here are some ideas about roleplaying on Everquest. 

First of all, what is roleplaying? Since Everquest is known as a roleplaying game, some of you may wish to know what that is. If not skip the whole next paragraph.

Roleplaying is a lot like play acting. It is acting out a part, or "Role". When you roleplay you don't just kill monsters and get treasure...although that may be part of your character's "role" in the game. In order to roleplay your conversation should be "in character" meaning when you talk out loud you say things that your character might say if it were real. The thing to avoid is saying things like "what level are you" out loud. Your character would not know anything about levels. But actually there is a way to ask that question in character. One paladin might ask another paladin, "what is your season?" and the other paladin might respond, "I am a paladin of the third circle, according to the laws of my guild," meaning the second paladin was 3rd level. See the differece? You sitting at home at your computer know about levels. But if you are playing the part of a paladin in a midieval fantasy world, then this is the way that your character should talk. One note...you are not required to do this. Verant will never kick anyone off a server for not roleplaying. But please read the next paragraph if you care about letting other people have the game experience they would like to have.

The first thing you should know is that if you are a roleplayer you are vastly in the minority. Non-roleplayers are the majority, and they sometimes get mad at us. I often hear non-roleplayers complaining that they hate when people try to "make them" roleplay. So here is my suggestion for how we solve the problem. Everyone should respect other people's right to play the game the way they want to. If you are a roleplayer, find other roleplayers and roleplay with them. Don't expect people to roleplay on Everquest because at least 29 out of 30 do not and never will roleplay. On the other hand if you are a non roleplayer this is all we ask of you: use /ooc to say things out of character. Save shouts for important things like shouting for help or to get help finding a corpse. And you don't have to be roleplaying every time you say something out loud...but if you are having a conversation out of character please use tells. That way those of us who are really trying to get into the role of our character don't have to be distracted by people talking about real-life movies or what level their characters on another server are.

Everyone has a right to play this game and have fun the way they want to play it. Just try not to let what you say or do hurt somebody else's game experience. If you are new to Everquest I suggest starting on the Brell Serilis server. It has been dubbed by Verant as the "unofficial roleplaying server" and since it opened an amazing number of roleplayers have come onto the server. On brell you have a great chance to find other people who play in-character to roleplay with. Look me up...I am Anarion Half-Elven, Ranger of Surefall Glade. Good luck to all, roleplayers and non-roleplayers alike.</font></td></tr>-->

				 Wow, this is really helpful. But it still dosn't help me at all. Here are some of MY tips for roleplaying!<BR>
<BR>
 1.If you are a barbarian don't talk. You can't<BR>
 2.If you are an ogre mispell everything and piss people off. This works good for trolls too.<BR>
 3.If you are a halfling act like you are retarded.<BR>
 4.If you are a gnome act like you live in a hole and read too much. Not like you don't in real life. Pansy.<BR>
 5.If you are a Wood Elf act cheerful and piss people off.<BR>
 6.If you are a dark elf or a high elf, you just have to act like an ass. It's a given.<BR>
 7.If you are a human, you don't deserve to live. Please delete your character immediatly.<BR>
 8.If you are a half elf, partially delete your character because you are part human (example, give your items and money to Yiggs on the Nameless) and then act like an ass. You win both ways!<BR>
<BR>
 This is how I play my characters, and don't say I can't roleplay well, because I have 40 different characters.
