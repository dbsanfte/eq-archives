<!--<tr><td><font face="verdana">If you are a young Druid (or Ranger), from Surefall Glade, you will be making many a trip between Surefall and Qeynos.  There are several quests that I do each time I make the trip to the bank from the Glade.

Starting in the Druid Guild, talk to a Druid whose name starts with a V. He will give you a "claim check" to deliver to Nesiff in Nesiff's Wooden Weapons and ask you to pick up a totem for him.  After talking to him, head to the Ranger Guild.  Just inside the door on the right, you will find Sivina Lutewhisper.  Tell her, "I will deliver the mail to Qeynos."  She will give you a letter for delivery.

Head for Qeynos.

Inside the gate at Qeynos, find Guard Weleth (sometimes he is inside the gatehouse) and tell him, "I will take the crate."  He will give you a crate for Nesiff and ask you to bring him a receipt.

Now, head to the area in front of Sneed's Trading Post (or sometimes the Monk Guild) and find Phin Esrinap.  Ask him, "Where is Konem?"  He will give you a note for Konem Matse, a monk usually found in the Qeynos Hills along the road to Surefall Glade.

Zone into South Qeynos and head to Nesiff's Wooden Weapons, across the courtyard from the clock.  Give Nesiff the "claim check". You will get experience and the totem to return to the Druid in Surefall Glade.  Give him the crate and you will get experience and a receipt for Guard Weleth.

Now, go to the Bard Guild.  Give Sivina's letter to Traylyn Marsinger. You will get experience and some money. (As much as 4gp)

To Traylyn's left is a Bard named Jusean.  Ask Jusean, "What watch reports?"   He will give you the names of two pairs of watches.  Ask him "Who are ***?" (*** = The first pair of names). He will give you a note for them.  Ask him "Who are ###?" (### = The second pair of names).   He will give you a note for the second pair.  He will also tell you that one pair is on the docks and the other at the North Gate.  Head to the docks and find one of the watches.  He will be at the arch near Voleen's Baked Goods.  Give him the note from Jusean and you will get experience and the watch report to return to Jusean.

Go to the bank, (or take care of any other business in  S. Qeynos).  Then zone back to North Qeynos.

Give Guard Weleth his receipt. You get experience and a small amount of coin.  Find the other Bard Watch upstairs in the Guardhouse.  Give him the note from Jusean and he will give you his watch report.  You will get experience.

Head back to Surefall Glade.  Be sure to look for Konem along the way.  Give Konem the note from Phin Esrinap.   You will get experience and a note to return to Phin.

At this point, you have a totem for the Druid, 2 Watch Reports (to be returned to Jusean on your next trip) and a note for Phin Esrinap (also to be returned next trip).

Deliver the totem the next time you are in Surefall Glade and start the cycle for your next trip!

This sounds like a lot of work, but the time it takes is really not much after you do it the first time and find out where everyone is.    Also, you are making the trip to the bank anyway!  It is good experience for the new character and many of the people give you coin too!!
