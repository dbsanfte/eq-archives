				I only hope that the split goes fairly for Veeshan<BR>
Being I &amp; my 2 other family members Preformed the<BR>
'/movelog yes' command when specified between 8pm<BR>
to 12am CST on the 22nd.<BR>
Problem &amp; I know alot of people that play on this<BR>
server had the same problem was that after everyone<BR>
got together in their guild's and or with family<BR>
members to perform the command as close as possible<BR>
or within an acceptable time it could not be done.<BR>
Seem's alot of us could not even log in to execute<BR>
the command until 2 to 3 and a half hours after<BR>
it was activated.( I know that was not expected<BR>
and I'm sure it will be quoted). However despite<BR>
that fact of it being 'Not Expected' isnt going<BR>
to be a good excuse for a few reasons.<BR>
1. Post when the server in question is being prep'd<BR>
   for a split (With Time For Command) at least a <BR>
   week before hand.<BR>
  * And dont say you cant because I know you can*<BR>
2. IF there's a problem that occur's (overcrowding,<BR>
   server problem's,etc..) Beyond the customers<BR>
   power then have ,and or give, the customer another<BR>
   chance (another command time) to perform the<BR>
   command when these problem's are better stabilized.<BR>
   (this would also help the one's that simply couldnt<BR>
    perform the command because of power outages,<BR>
    the set time could NOT be meet for personal reason's<BR>
    etc..)<BR>
Look. Fact is,You guy's should do something to address this<BR>
if you havent already prepared to help those left behind.<BR>
<BR>
     Thank You.<BR>
       Voice of 220 plus (Veeshan) <BR>
P.S.<BR>
   On this night,during these hours a freind of mine<BR>
   went in EQ chat to find out what was going on that<BR>
   it was such a problem logging in.<BR>
   Also to find out if doing the movelog command the<BR>
   day before would be ok since word got out to MANY<BR>
   people on the 21st it was activated.<BR>
   A GM there TOLD him if you did that command on the<BR>
   21st you were disqualified from moving?<BR>
   Need to Speak to this (GM) if I were you.<BR>
   There is Absolutely no-way that will fly.<BR>

				I posted this the night you informed us about the split, and I am resposting since I haven't seen it responded to.<BR>
<BR>
Our guild figured that there would be a split on Bristlebane - guides had told us, common sense told us.<BR>
<BR>
Yet, the announcement is made on Friday night of Easter weekend!<BR>
<BR>
Although we had decided to go, we had to make the decision not to, because it was a holiday and many people who WANTED to leave were out of town, or spending time with family!<BR>
<BR>
The planning here was horrendous. I cannot believe that you did this to the members of the servers who wanted to leave. Additionally I made a suggestion to a guide (it came from a guild member) that you should have given the guild master the ability to do a &quot;guildmove&quot; command. That way we could have kept guilds together, and any individual who didn't want to go could have removed herself / himself from the guild (s) that they were in if they didn't want to go. Are you going to post how many people left the servers?

				Guess the extra 2 hours isnt just for those splitting but all of us.  By my calc the game should be up now but isnt, how much longeR????<BR>
<BR>
OH and you people whining about not getting to split, bigdeal.  You want to be on a diff named server?  The server is being split to reduce the population, for a time.  So if you DON'T get to move just think of all the people who DID move and now you are on a server with a smaller player base.  Its a WIN-WIN situation.  Wether you get to split or not is inconsequential, let the hordes of idiots go to the new server because its &quot;cool&quot; while you reap the rewards of you and your longtime frieds staying on the original server.<BR>
<BR>
This whining is pointless, when its such a obvious WIN situation wether you move or not.
