Good choice! The shaman is an all around excellent character to play in Everquest. I would like to share with you some of the tips and tactics I have used to raise my Shaman from levels 1 through 10. Let's go step by step through this process and begin with Stat and race selection. 

RACE & STAT SELECTION:

Why a barbarian shaman? Why not an overpowering Ogre, or a terrifying Troll? Well, they’re all good choices.  With each race, there are advantages and disadvantages. Let’s look at each race, and the pros and cons with choosing them…

OGRE : 

PROS
Highest base Strength and Stamina of any available shaman race.
Good starting point for newbies.
Slam ability from level one.
Infravision (allows you to see in the dark)

CONS
Lowest base Agility and Dexterity of any available shaman race.
Hated and killed on sight by NPC’s and Guards in most areas (Evil race)
Can only wear large armor.


TROLL:

PROS
Racial regeneration ability helps recuperate health rapidly.
Good starting point for newbies.
Slam ability from level one.
Infravision (allows you to see in the dark)

CONS
Lowest base Wisdom (shaman’s key ability) and Intelligence of any available shaman race.
Hated and killed on sight by NPC’s and Guards in most areas (Evil race)
Can only wear large armor.


BARBARIAN

PROS
Highest base Wisdom (shaman’s key ability) and Charisma of any available shaman race.
Accepted in most places except evil areas.
Excellent starting point for newbies.
Slam ability from level one.
Ability to wear large or medium armors.

CONS
Lowest Strength and Stamina of any of the available shaman races.
No infravision.

I am sure there are many more pros and cons but these are a few that come to mind right away. In making my decision, I chose a Barbarian. This was due to the fact that I like to explore and group with others and the Barbarians general acceptance made this preferable. Now that I have chosen the race, lets look at the stats of the barbarian shaman.


STR 	STA	 AGI 	DEX 	WIS 	INT 	CHR 	+ ADD 	

Barbarian 	103 	100 	82 	70 	80 	60 	60 	30 


The numbers that appeared in red (Wis, Sta, and Cha) are the prime attributes of any Shaman. I would rank Wisdom as the most important, as it will determine the base amount of Mana that you begin with. Mana is the force which allows you to cast spells, and is displayed in game as the blue bar below the red health bar. Mana is of highest importance to any spell casting class and the shaman is no exception. 

My recommendation would be to put as much of your additional points towards Wisdom as possible. I would say that at least ¾ of your additional points should go to Wisdom. You should try to have a minimum of 100 Wisdom to start. I know this seems like a lot, but believe me it will help in the long run, when spells take much more mana to cast. It is far better to create a character that has the skill early on, then to have to delete that character at level 20 because his Wisdom is too low. A stitch in time saves nine!

Any remaining points you have can be divided up into the various attributes you feel are important. Below is a description of each of the attributes and what they do. ( Taken from the EQ stratics webpage (http://eq.stratics.com/attr_ref.shtml)

Statistic scores in EverQuest govern many things about your character; how hard they can hit, total hit points, mana, chance to hit, chance to dodge, NPC prices and how quickly skills are learned. This article will explain the function of each stat. 

STRENGTH (Melee Damage, Weight Allowance) 
First and most apparently, STR determines your weight limit. Each STR point allows you a weight point. Secondly, STR determines upper damage caps which becomes more obvious at levels 20+. The bonus is significant, and the looting capacity is very nice at the upper levels when you are finding many weapons and plate level armor. For those reasons, I *highly* recommend this stat for melee types, and you might even consider a bit for mage types. 

STAMINA (Hit Points, Fatigue) 
STA determines your starting hit points and how many hit points you get per level. The other factors in this equation are race and class. This stat used to not do very much, but recent changes have made its impact significant. If you want to be able to take a bigger beating, put some points into STA. In addition, this attribute affects your Stamina points, and, therefore, how quickly your character fatigues over time. 

AGILITY (Dodge Percentage, Starting AC) 
AGI is a stat that affects your chance to dodge and/or avoid damage. Once you are hit, you take an armor roll for how much damage is absorbed. By this token, this stat is important even if you have great armor. I recommend this stat for all classes: for melee types, you will fight better, and magic types with low hit points/armor class should take as few hits as possible. Also, the less you are hit, the less likely you are to be interrupted in your casting. Your character's starting Armor Class (AC) is also directly affected by this attribute. 



DEXTERITY (Chance to Hit, Instrument Playing) 
DEX is a chance to hit stat. Some people believe it determines how often you reach your damage cap (the range of which is decided by STR), others believe it just determines hit or miss. Either way, it is an important skill for melee, and not very important for casters. Bards should take note, this is an important skill for them, and gauges how skillfully they can play their instruments (but most stats are important to bards). 

WISDOM (Mana for Priests, Resistance to Mind Spells, Tertiary Skill Check) 
WIS is the mana determinant for the priestly casters, and their derived hybrids (Cleric, Shaman, Druid, Ranger, Paladin). It is bar none the most important stat for the former three classes and a consideration for the latter two. This attribute also affects your character's resistance against mind-affecting spells, such as Charm. In addition, WIS provides a last chance to succeed at a failed skill roll. Although INT is the secondary skill-up attribute for most skills, WIS may grant you to continue a failed skill roll. Minimal as the chance may be, it is still the opportunity to succeed on a roll one has already failed via skill check. 

INTELLIGENCE (Mana for Mages, Skill Gain) 
INT is the mana determinant for the non-priestly casters (Wizard, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer), their derived hybrid (Shadowknight), and also determines how quickly one will gain skills. As such, it is important to all classes, but is especially so for the four non-priestly casters. 

CHARISMA (Faction Standing, Merchant Prices, Charm Success) 
CHA affects NPC prices--when both buying and selling--and also how NPCs will react to you. While generally not a stat that most people raise, saving some hard-earned platinum on that plate breastplate is always a nice bonus. Also, CHA is almost the INT of faction. By having high CHA, you reduce the amount of faction you need to have NPCs change their view toward you. This can be a nice bonus when questing. It is also a factor for Charm spells, which notably affects the enchanter. 
Hope this helped all of you, and feel free to email me at ffil@stratics.com with anything I did not make clear.

As mentioned earlier, Wisdom would be the most beneficial for the shaman. Any bonus points beyond that is really the players choice. My recommendation would be Agility, to allow you to dodge more blows in combat, or the one I overlooked, Intelligence. I think Intelligence is important because it determines how rapidly your skills increase. The more intelligence, the faster your skills progress. Shaman’s start with a low base intelligence and this can cause slow skill progression. 


STARTING OUT:

Your character will be opening their eyes for the first time in the Barbarian village of Halas. Halas has all the emenities of home, a bank, an armorer, places to buy food and water, and of course, the shaman guild. I am not going into a long drawn out description of where to find each place, but to assist you, feel free to ask some of the veteran players that will no doubt be there. Many will be happy to help out. Your first task should be to memorize your beginning spells, Minor Healing and Inner Fire. This is extremely important because if you die before you memorize them, you will lose them forever!!! ( you can always buy them later…but you will have to pay for them.) After you do that, you should go to the guild and give the guild leader your note. The note will tell you who to give it to. Once you have given your note to the guild leader, you will gain experience, and a guild tunic. You will probably want to equip your tunic as it will provide better protection than your clothes ( but not by much). Now you are ready to begin that long journey to level 50!

	At the guild you will also be able to train 5 points into a variety of skills. My recommendation would be 1 point to 1 handed blunt, 1 point to 2 handed blunt, 1 point to sense heading, 1 point to alteration, and 1 point to a trade of your choice ( my recommendation is tailoring.) These can be disputed in many ways but it is really up to you. You should also make a hot key to your slam ability. This will only ever do 1 point of damage, but it is an extra attack and it can disrupt spellcasting foes.

	You will begin by heading out to the Everfrost to adventure. When you first begin, you should remain close to the guards at the gate. If you ever find yourself in trouble, run back to the guards. They will save your bacon if things go bad! My recommendation is to head past the guards to the first open area, from there, turn left. You can wait here for creatures or venture a little further if that area is crowded. NEVER venture past the third tree before level 4. I believe this zone to be the best for newbie characters. The creatures are not extremely strong and actually give good loot. By attacking gnoll pups, or goblin whelps, you can actually make some money and find those all-important bags, boxes and backpacks. Polar bear cubs give skins which can be used to make armor. The one dangerous thing about this area is the preponderance of trains. Creatures will often gang up on you! The key to surviving this is two-fold. One, stay close enough to run to the guards if this happens. Two, most creatures tend to move down the middle of the valley here. Park yourself on one side near the wall and pull creatures over to that area to battle. This will prevent another creature walking up behind you and giving you a nasty bit of back door action!

	You should be able to gain enough experience here to get to level 5. You will want to spend the money you have made on the rest of your level one spells as you can afford them, and some patchwork armor. Patchwork armor is often made by players with the tailoring skill. It is inexpensive and can be purchased in pieces for a few gold each.  Be sure to head back to your guild to train your abilities. Remember that every level you gain gives you 5 more points to train with. You also should be looking for a better weapon, this might be a rusty mace, or if you want to go 2 handed (slower but more damage) a worn great staff.  These weapons can often be found on the decaying skeletons that roam the region. By level 5, you should be getting the hang and timing of combat. Casting direct damage spells (DD) in between your opponents attack is a crucial skill you will need to develop through play. Up to level 5, you will probably be going solo for most of your adventures, as the shaman at this point are almost as good as a regular warrior in combat.

	Level 5 brings a new challenge and also new spells. You will want to get your level two spells as soon as possible. Many of them can be purchased from the guild in Halas, some however are not so easily accessible. The spells I would buy in order would be…
			
Frost Rift

Gate

Feet Like Cat

Sicken ( only found on platform in Everfrost plains )

Summon Drink

Drowsy

…and the rest I don’t have a preference for the order.


LEVEL 5 AND BEYOND

	From this point on things get a little rough. These can be very slow for the shaman, and often a good hunting place is difficult to find. The fare you have been dealing with to this point will not give you experience anymore. Moving out to the plains of Everfrost is risky, as the creatures there are tough. Your best bet at this point is to take on the scrawny gnolls that populate the entrance to Blackburrow, or to go on your first roadtrip! Through Blackburrow and emerge on the other side in the Qeynos Hills. Continue following the road from Blackburrow through Qeynos hills and you should eventually come to the north Qeynos gate. Before I jump ahead, you may want to get a bind at the Qeynos city gate. That way, if you die in combat, you will re-appear there instead of back in Halas. If you ask around at the gate, someone should be able to do that for you. Qeynos should be your launching point for the next few levels. Qeynos Hills is a good place to gain experience. You can kill fire beetles (who’s eyes can be used as a lightsource and sell for a couple of silver each), scrawny gnolls, brown bears, and wolves. Be sure to /CON everything you see to make sure the risk is worth it.  
	
	At level 6, I would look at joining a group and venturing into Blackburrow. Blackburrow is a good area to hunt because the experience is good and you can make a lot of cash. Be wary of trains though, as this place has lots of them. You will die here from time to time, so be prepared! Again, be sure to /CON everything. You may want to stick to scrawny and regular gnolls to begin, and as you progress in levels, try out the brawny and gnoll guardsman. Make sure to have lots of bags and boxes as the loot these guys drop (cloth armor, Hunting bows and arrows, rusty weapons) can usually be sold in town for some gold. I would hunt here until level 8.

LEVEL 8

Level 8 is very important for the shaman. This is because you will need to return to Halas and train in Meditation. Meditation is a skill learned at level 8 that allows you to regain mana much faster than before. If you have been casting spells up to this point, you will know how fast you can burn through your mana! And how long it takes to regain it! When you choose to train in meditate, you will only need to assign 1 point to it. It will rise very rapidly on its own every time you meditate or memorize spells.
	While you are in Halas, you might as well buy some of your 9th level spells so you don’t have to make a return trip when you finally reach 9. I would recommend putting the spells in the bank until you gain the 9th level and can write them in your spellbook. The spells begin to get a little more expensive now, but you should have some money saved up from your ventures into Blackburrow. I would recommend buying a few spells at this point…

Spirit Of Wolf (A definite must have!!!)

Light Healing

Tainted Breath  (Must be purchased from platform in Everfrost plains)

Summon Food


It is also at this point that you should be considering started to upgrade the armor you currently own. Player’s with the blacksmithing skill can make a type of armor called banded. It is an excellent armor that is the most effective a shaman can wear besides magical armors. Banded mail can be quite expensive so keep you eyes and ears peeled for deals and try to buy one piece at a time. You will not be able to buy an entire suit until you are much higher level, so try to be conservative! You will have to buy some expensive spells as well as you move on. The advantage that Barbarian shamans have over Trolls and Ogres is that we can wear medium or large size banded armor. I would recommend buying medium sized as it is more readily available and is lighter but just as effective in terms of protection.


LEVEL 9

The last 2 levels were probably a living hell. That is normal, level 7 and 8 progress very slowly, but now you have reached a new pinnacle, Level 9. Level 9 is where a shaman is finally a real adventurer. Not only do you get some more health and mana, but you also get some fantastic spells. 

	Spirit of Wolf is the spell that makes you a real shaman! This spell allows you to increase the targets foot speed by 30 to 40%. This may not seem like much, but it certainly cuts down on travel time and will help you outrun the monster that has gotten the better of you. Many other players will ask you to cast it on them to help cut down on there travel time. Many players will even pay you for it! ( The first day I got the spell, I cast it at the Qeynos city gate on other players and earned 10 platinum! That is more than several hard days fighting in blackburrow!) I always keep this spell memorized and always on. You are going to start venturing out into the world soon so this spell will definitely help.

	Tainted breath will also help tremendously! It is your first potent DoT spell (Damage Over Time). It will do initial damage to a monster but continue to damage as the fight progresses. I cast this on a creature first as a lure, then back up, cast sicken or drowsy, then engage in melee. You can beat creatures that  /CON blue, white or even yellow this way. You must travel to the Everfrost plains to buy this spell from the merchant at the platform. Ask someone for directions and I am sure they will be happy to help.

	Light Healing is an upgrade to your now limited minor healing spell. It heals much more damage than the previous one, and you will need it for when you take on these more powerful creatures.

It was at this point in my career as a shaman that I first ventured to West Karanas. Here I stayed near the second guard tower and hunted young lions, giant spiders, and mist wolves until I had gained 1 bubble into 9th. From there, I will only tell you that I completed the Bloodforge Hammer quest to gain a better, magical weapon.  Not only was it fun to do, but I gained a really tough magic weapon out of it. 

	Well at this point, I am level 10 and currently hunting in Misty Thicket and gaining experience like crazy. These levels have been extremely fast. In a few hour of playing, I am 2 bubbles away from 11th level. As I start to gain more levels, I will write another guide to adventuring in your teens.


Until then,
May the Tribunal guide you safely!

STRENGTH (Melee Damage, Weight Allowance) <BR>
First and most apparently, STR determines your weight limit. Each STR point allows you a weight point. Secondly, STR determines upper damage caps which becomes more obvious at levels 20+. The bonus is significant, and the looting capacity is very nice at the upper levels when you are finding many weapons and plate level armor. For those reasons, I *highly* recommend this stat for melee types, and you might even consider a bit for mage types. <BR>
<BR>
STAMINA (Hit Points, Fatigue) <BR>
STA determines your starting hit points and how many hit points you get per level. The other factors in this equation are race and class. This stat used to not do very much, but recent changes have made its impact significant. If you want to be able to take a bigger beating, put some points into STA. In addition, this attribute affects your Stamina points, and, therefore, how quickly your character fatigues over time. <BR>
<BR>
AGILITY (Dodge Percentage, Starting AC) <BR>
AGI is a stat that affects your chance to dodge and/or avoid damage. Once you are hit, you take an armor roll for how much damage is absorbed. By this token, this stat is important even if you have great armor. I recommend this stat for all classes: for melee types, you will fight better, and magic types with low hit points/armor class should take as few hits as possible. Also, the less you are hit, the less likely you are to be interrupted in your casting. Your character's starting Armor Class (AC) is also directly affected by this attribute. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
DEXTERITY (Chance to Hit, Instrument Playing) <BR>
DEX is a chance to hit stat. Some people believe it determines how often you reach your damage cap (the range of which is decided by STR), others believe it just determines hit or miss. Either way, it is an important skill for melee, and not very important for casters. Bards should take note, this is an important skill for them, and gauges how skillfully they can play their instruments (but most stats are important to bards). <BR>
<BR>
WISDOM (Mana for Priests, Resistance to Mind Spells, Tertiary Skill Check) <BR>
WIS is the mana determinant for the priestly casters, and their derived hybrids (Cleric, Shaman, Druid, Ranger, Paladin). It is bar none the most important stat for the former three classes and a consideration for the latter two. This attribute also affects your character's resistance against mind-affecting spells, such as Charm. In addition, WIS provides a last chance to succeed at a failed skill roll. Although INT is the secondary skill-up attribute for most skills, WIS may grant you to continue a failed skill roll. Minimal as the chance may be, it is still the opportunity to succeed on a roll one has already failed via skill check. <BR>
<BR>
INTELLIGENCE (Mana for Mages, Skill Gain) <BR>
INT is the mana determinant for the non-priestly casters (Wizard, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer), their derived hybrid (Shadowknight), and also determines how quickly one will gain skills. As such, it is important to all classes, but is especially so for the four non-priestly casters. <BR>
<BR>
CHARISMA (Faction Standing, Merchant Prices, Charm Success) <BR>
CHA affects NPC prices--when both buying and selling--and also how NPCs will react to you. While generally not a stat that most people raise, saving some hard-earned platinum on that plate breastplate is always a nice bonus. Also, CHA is almost the INT of faction. By having high CHA, you reduce the amount of faction you need to have NPCs change their view toward you. This can be a nice bonus when questing. It is also a factor for Charm spells, which notably affects the enchanter. <BR>

As mentioned earlier, Wisdom would be the most beneficial for the shaman. Any bonus points beyond that is really the players choice. My recommendation would be Agility, to allow you to dodge more blows in combat, or the one I overlooked, Intelligence. I think Intelligence is important because it determines how rapidly your skills increase. The more intelligence, the faster your skills progress. Shaman&#8217;s start with a low base intelligence and this can cause slow skill progression. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
STARTING OUT:<BR>
<BR>
Your character will be opening their eyes for the first time in the Barbarian village of Halas. Halas has all the emenities of home, a bank, an armorer, places to buy food and water, and of course, the shaman guild. I am not going into a long drawn out description of where to find each place, but to assist you, feel free to ask some of the veteran players that will no doubt be there. Many will be happy to help out. Your first task should be to memorize your beginning spells, Minor Healing and Inner Fire. This is extremely important because if you die before you memorize them, you will lose them forever!!! ( you can always buy them later&#8230;but you will have to pay for them.) After you do that, you should go to the guild and give the guild leader your note. The note will tell you who to give it to. Once you have given your note to the guild leader, you will gain experience, and a guild tunic. You will probably want to equip your tunic as it will provide better protection than your clothes ( but not by much). Now you are ready to begin that long journey to level 50!<BR>
<BR>
	At the guild you will also be able to train 5 points into a variety of skills. My recommendation would be 1 point to 1 handed blunt, 1 point to 2 handed blunt, 1 point to sense heading, 1 point to alteration, and 1 point to a trade of your choice ( my recommendation is tailoring.) These can be disputed in many ways but it is really up to you. You should also make a hot key to your slam ability. This will only ever do 1 point of damage, but it is an extra attack and it can disrupt spellcasting foes.<BR>
<BR>
	You will begin by heading out to the Everfrost to adventure. When you first begin, you should remain close to the guards at the gate. If you ever find yourself in trouble, run back to the guards. They will save your bacon if things go bad! My recommendation is to head past the guards to the first open area, from there, turn left. You can wait here for creatures or venture a little further if that area is crowded. NEVER venture past the third tree before level 4. I believe this zone to be the best for newbie characters. The creatures are not extremely strong and actually give good loot. By attacking gnoll pups, or goblin whelps, you can actually make some money and find those all-important bags, boxes and backpacks. Polar bear cubs give skins which can be used to make armor. The one dangerous thing about this area is the preponderance of trains. Creatures will often gang up on you! The key to surviving this is two-fold. One, stay close enough to run to the guards if this happens. Two, most creatures tend to move down the middle of the valley here. Park yourself on one side near the wall and pull creatures over to that area to battle. This will prevent another creature walking up behind you and giving you a nasty bit of back door action!<BR>
<BR>
	You should be able to gain enough experience here to get to level 5. You will want to spend the money you have made on the rest of your level one spells as you can afford them, and some patchwork armor. Patchwork armor is often made by players with the tailoring skill. It is inexpensive and can be purchased in pieces for a few gold each.  Be sure to head back to your guild to train your abilities. Remember that every level you gain gives you 5 more points to train with. You also should be looking for a better weapon, this might be a rusty mace, or if you want to go 2 handed (slower but more damage) a worn great staff.  These weapons can often be found on the decaying skeletons that roam the region. By level 5, you should be getting the hang and timing of combat. Casting direct damage spells (DD) in between your opponents attack is a crucial skill you will need to develop through play. Up to level 5, you will probably be going solo for most of your adventures, as the shaman at this point are almost as good as a regular warrior in combat.<BR>
<BR>
	Level 5 brings a new challenge and also new spells. You will want to get your level two spells as soon as possible. Many of them can be purchased from the guild in Halas, some however are not so easily accessible. The spells I would buy in order would be&#8230;<BR>
			<BR>
Frost Rift<BR>
<BR>
Gate<BR>
<BR>
Feet Like Cat<BR>
<BR>
Sicken ( only found on platform in Everfrost plains )<BR>
<BR>
Summon Drink<BR>
<BR>
Drowsy<BR>
<BR>
&#8230;and the rest I don&#8217;t have a preference for the order.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
LEVEL 5 AND BEYOND<BR>
<BR>
	From this point on things get a little rough. These can be very slow for the shaman, and often a good hunting place is difficult to find. The fare you have been dealing with to this point will not give you experience anymore. Moving out to the plains of Everfrost is risky, as the creatures there are tough. Your best bet at this point is to take on the scrawny gnolls that populate the entrance to Blackburrow, or to go on your first roadtrip! Through Blackburrow and emerge on the other side in the Qeynos Hills. Continue following the road from Blackburrow through Qeynos hills and you should eventually come to the north Qeynos gate. Before I jump ahead, you may want to get a bind at the Qeynos city gate. That way, if you die in combat, you will re-appear there instead of back in Halas. If you ask around at the gate, someone should be able to do that for you. Qeynos should be your launching point for the next few levels. Qeynos Hills is a good place to gain experience. You can kill fire beetles (who&#8217;s eyes can be used as a lightsource and sell for a couple of silver each), scrawny gnolls, brown bears, and wolves. Be sure to /CON everything you see to make sure the risk is worth it.  <BR>
	<BR>
	At level 6, I would look at joining a group and venturing into Blackburrow. Blackburrow is a good area to hunt because the experience is good and you can make a lot of cash. Be wary of trains though, as this place has lots of them. You will die here from time to time, so be prepared! Again, be sure to /CON everything. You may want to stick to scrawny and regular gnolls to begin, and as you progress in levels, try out the brawny and gnoll guardsman. Make sure to have lots of bags and boxes as the loot these guys drop (cloth armor, Hunting bows and arrows, rusty weapons) can usually be sold in town for some gold. I would hunt here until level 8.<BR>
<BR>
LEVEL 8<BR>
<BR>
Level 8 is very important for the shaman. This is because you will need to return to Halas and train in Meditation. Meditation is a skill learned at level 8 that allows you to regain mana much faster than before. If you have been casting spells up to this point, you will know how fast you can burn through your mana! And how long it takes to regain it! When you choose to train in meditate, you will only need to assign 1 point to it. It will rise very rapidly on its own every time you meditate or memorize spells.<BR>
	While you are in Halas, you might as well buy some of your 9th level spells so you don&#8217;t have to make a return trip when you finally reach 9. I would recommend putting the spells in the bank until you gain the 9th level and can write them in your spellbook. The spells begin to get a little more expensive now, but you should have some money saved up from your ventures into Blackburrow. I would recommend buying a few spells at this point&#8230;<BR>
<BR>
Spirit Of Wolf (A definite must have!!!)<BR>
<BR>
Light Healing<BR>
<BR>
Tainted Breath  (Must be purchased from platform in Everfrost plains)<BR>
<BR>
Summon Food<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is also at this point that you should be considering started to upgrade the armor you currently own. Player&#8217;s with the blacksmithing skill can make a type of armor called banded. It is an excellent armor that is the most effective a shaman can wear besides magical armors. Banded mail can be quite expensive so keep you eyes and ears peeled for deals and try to buy one piece at a time. You will not be able to buy an entire suit until you are much higher level, so try to be conservative! You will have to buy some expensive spells as well as you move on. The advantage that Barbarian shamans have over Trolls and Ogres is that we can wear medium or large size banded armor. I would recommend buying medium sized as it is more readily available and is lighter but just as effective in terms of protection.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
LEVEL 9<BR>
<BR>
The last 2 levels were probably a living hell. That is normal, level 7 and 8 progress very slowly, but now you have reached a new pinnacle, Level 9. Level 9 is where a shaman is finally a real adventurer. Not only do you get some more health and mana, but you also get some fantastic spells. <BR>
<BR>
	Spirit of Wolf is the spell that makes you a real shaman! This spell allows you to increase the targets foot speed by 30 to 40%. This may not seem like much, but it certainly cuts down on travel time and will help you outrun the monster that has gotten the better of you. Many other players will ask you to cast it on them to help cut down on there travel time. Many players will even pay you for it! ( The first day I got the spell, I cast it at the Qeynos city gate on other players and earned 10 platinum! That is more than several hard days fighting in blackburrow!) I always keep this spell memorized and always on. You are going to start venturing out into the world soon so this spell will definitely help.<BR>
<BR>
	Tainted breath will also help tremendously! It is your first potent DoT spell (Damage Over Time). It will do initial damage to a monster but continue to damage as the fight progresses. I cast this on a creature first as a lure, then back up, cast sicken or drowsy, then engage in melee. You can beat creatures that  /CON blue, white or even yellow this way. You must travel to the Everfrost plains to buy this spell from the merchant at the platform. Ask someone for directions and I am sure they will be happy to help.<BR>
<BR>
	Light Healing is an upgrade to your now limited minor healing spell. It heals much more damage than the previous one, and you will need it for when you take on these more powerful creatures.<BR>
<BR>
It was at this point in my career as a shaman that I first ventured to West Karanas. Here I stayed near the second guard tower and hunted young lions, giant spiders, and mist wolves until I had gained 1 bubble into 9th. From there, I will only tell you that I completed the Bloodforge Hammer quest to gain a better, magical weapon.  Not only was it fun to do, but I gained a really tough magic weapon out of it. <BR>
<BR>
	Well at this point, I am level 10 and currently hunting in Misty Thicket and gaining experience like crazy. These levels have been extremely fast. In a few hour of playing, I am 2 bubbles away from 11th level. As I start to gain more levels, I will write another guide to adventuring in your teens.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Until then,<BR>
May the Tribunal guide you safely!<BR>
