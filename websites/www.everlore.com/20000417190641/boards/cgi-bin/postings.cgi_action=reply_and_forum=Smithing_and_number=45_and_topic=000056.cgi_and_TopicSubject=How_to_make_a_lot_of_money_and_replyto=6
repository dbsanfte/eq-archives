I'd certainly buy the ore and it would be profitable for whoever did it!                                           I'm on the tribunal and if your selling ore near Qeynos give me a tell! /tell Danthorn      Thanx, Will  <IMG SRC="http://www.everlore.com/boards/EL/smile.gif"><BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">FireBlaze</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">That could be a good idea. Why don't they sell ore near Qeynos. I have to travel to highpass or freeport often if I want to practice my smithing, i'm risking my life on the journey and it is getting really annoying. I'm probably going to give up smithing just because i can't get the materials i need! Sort it out Verant.

I mean everything is more expensive there, because qeynos never has what people want, and there are very few quests over there. here is a perfect example.<BR>When I had my bar/shm i was on the west coast and alot of people wanted bloodforge, constantly saw "auction wtb bloodforge" saw it sell for 100+ plat one day.<BR>However when I got to the east coast one day I was in nro and saw this guy that said "selling bloodforge any decent offers accepted I'm sick of this thing" ROFLMAO!</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">ShadoJak</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">I started out in Qeynos as a smith, at about lev 5 i started dumping all my stuff in the bank and running to highpass with only a rusty sword.  From there i would buy and bank supplies and usually end up taking the poor-mans gate home, meaning death... Eventually i realized that it was easiest to go to rivervale to convert ore to bits, since the water person is right next to the forge.  Still i wish i had relocated to FP earlier to gain skill there.<P>Master Smith 135</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Nymrod</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Ok THE best place in all of norath is freeport,(That i've been to).<BR>There is a shop in north freeport, that sells all the molds you need, and all the ore you want, they sell sheet metal too.<P>Nymrod, 11th lvl paladin, tarew marr.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Bethorne</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Selling ore in quenos is a good idea. Th e bad thing is when someone to run all the way to HH and back they expect to make a fortune. And whenever i hear anyone selling sharpning stones, the lowest cost i have seen was 5silver, and most is a gold, A sharpning stones retail price from the merchant is almost always below a silver. Buying 10 stones could cost you a gold or 10 gold depending on how far you are from freeport. </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Bard Valmi (Tunare)</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">What about Feydwer?

I made the trip at lvl 8 or 9. Just get SoW and if poss invis, I went straight along all the paths and was only attacked by a lion along the whole trip (which i killed and made into some boots). Just watch out in HH, only go through the spawning points when they are clear, there is nearly always people camping them so just wait till those people have killed all Gnolls etc. I made the trip carrying all my stuff, I just made sure that i got bound in HH and when i got to freeport, i would still recomend putting everything in the bank and make the trip with nothing on you, then if you die all you lose is Xp. Just make sure you get SoW and run and avoid things like HGs obviously.

As far as getting ore in Faydwer, the only place you can get them (as far as I heard), is at one of the windmills near the Mino Mine in Steamfront Mtn.  I'd would think it logical for the dwarves to have ore for sale in Kaladim considering they have a mine and all, go figure.<P>Cronyn Lonewolf<BR>32 Ranger of Innoruuk</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Danthorn</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Hi, if anyone needs to talk to me i'm on the tribunal, give Danthorn a tell. Youcan get ore in north freeport for sure, it's right next to one of the forges, getting water is hard to get though, you can buy it oposite the stage in west qeynos. If you need a hand give me a tell, if i'm around i'll try to help.       Bye, Will  <IMG SRC="http://www.everlore.com/boards/EL/smile.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Bard Valmi (Tunare)</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Thanks Cronyn, I found ore at the windmills.  Problem is they charge an arm and a leg!  I'm really beginning to like the idea of buying in HPass, and selling in Halas and Qeynos!  I learned (for those other lightweights) that a Large Sewing Kit weighs much less than a Backpack, and carries the same amount.  Every little bit helps when you're hauling ore out of Steamfront!  <BR>The above post is unclear. You talk about getting ore in Freeport, and difficulty getting Water in Qeynos!  Are you talking about buying water or ore across from the stage, and in what city?  Please clarify.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Frens</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">This topic gave me a thought: if you were high enough level, you could hunt a bunch of muddites and sell the clay and ore.  The clay may not fetch a great price in Qeynos because Halas is nearby, but the ore definitely should be worth something.  Then again, unless the person is a twink, by the time they actually need ore they should be able to travel a little.  So that sort of defeats the purpose.<P>Frens<BR>Forge-jockey extraordinarily</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Citer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">I am not a smith.  I am simply a magician.  However, do know that a good place to get ore and exp at the same time is in the Lavastorm mountains.  I have spent a great deal of time there making fantastic exp (when I started there I was only level 11, so it's not just for the high levels either), and beating up on stone dervishes who seem (in my experience) to always leave ore as loot.  Want exp and ore as a smith of any class?  Head to Lavastorm, that's my two cp.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Rankorian</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">I am a gnome, and Akanon seems to be a very nice place to learn smithing.  The water is near the forge. And a merchant is right next to the forge (for selling items).  The molds are just out of town, and the ore is next to some wonderful hunting spots.<P>Come to think of it...forget what I just wrote...I do not want the competition.<P>Rankorian</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Euar Firestreak -Veeshan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">I am a magician and a smith .. Magicians make the best smiths. Why? Because of the Dim Pocket spell and later the Dim Hole. 4/8 space no-weight container. Anything can fit in and if your carring Ore Small or Large you can do it with NO loss in speed ..IE 40 large bricks of Ore on you 40 in the bank and travel at full speed. hehe Any magician that doesnt smith is silly, no weight ,high int (for fast learning curve) and you dont use what you make.<P>Euar Firestreak Order of the Crimson Dragon<BR>Firing<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Wolfe</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">You guys need to do some adventuring...<P>For the sharpening stones, they are worth about 3 copper. That's it. I can therefore get 100 sharpening stones for 3 gold.  ore is also not too expensive. You just have to know where to look.  <P>OK if you want to smith, Freeport is the place to be. There is a forge near the Temple of Marr and next to the Bard's guildhall called GROFLAH'S FORGE.  Groflah Steadirt is upstairs, by the way, so if you have a quest, don't give the quest items to Ardiflah Steadirt!!!<BR>Anyway, there is a human merchant woman behind the counter who sells the stones, ore, and molds.  Buy these things from her. buy a lot of ore from her and put it in a backpack. If you need water, all you have to do from the forge is this:  If you are facing the forge, turn left and follow the wall. You will go on a grassy area with walls. Continue and stay left. There is a place called "Freepport office of the people."  You can buy water from the men behind the counter, as well as several other useful traveling items. If you are a Paladin, the sewer tunnel leads directly to the offoce of the people.  <P>That's all the components. The lady also sells molds to several armour pieces, and if you find yourself needing other molds, go to East Freeport and check out a place called "Armor by Ikthar." They don't seem to sell ore but you can take some from North to it.<P>Jamisson of Xegony</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Bummed</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">everyone and there mother TWINKS..who gives a rats ass</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Valmi</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">(it's amusing fellows like the previous post that keep me endlessly amused)<BR>Thanks for the idea Will!  With a WIS of 60, I finally had to give up on Trade Skills until I can get LOTS of +WIS items!  Until then I have a new field. Procurement. As a BARD, I can travel very fast, and often do. I'm perfectly able and willing to run ore and stones from Highpass to Qeynos.  I ran 40 stones and just one stack of ore pieces to Qeynos and sold them in the time it took me to get to the bank and get them.  Will do it again, and take orders!  I also will provide raw materials to Tradesman to practice with in exchange for the results. They get the improvement, I get the item at (at worst) 3/4 sale value. <BR>Valmi's Express Service, "We don't stop to play with the kitties in Karana"</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Kight-Bristlebane</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Wolfe is right, I've seen her ALL over the place on Bristlebane, wearing different, BETTER stuff everytime.<P>Kight, Dwarven Cleric of the 12 circle<BR>Open for guilds if anyone wants me!</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></td></tr></table>
