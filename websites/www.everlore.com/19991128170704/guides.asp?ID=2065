	Welcome children of the woods. We the rangers and our kin the druids
              are the keepers of the outdoors. No others are as well suited to being 
              outside the safe walls of the cities as we. We the rangers have certain 
              innate abilities that makes us valuable assets to any party.
 	This guide is only one way to play this excellent character. The ideas 
              suggested from here on are ones that have been hard learned and are
               passed on freely.
	The first step is your character creation. Choose wisely as these choices 
              will determine how you live, fight, and even die. I chose the half elf ranger 
              as they have the bonus of infravision from their elven heritage as well as some
               of the agility and dexterity bonus . The elves weaker strength is offset by the 
              human side of the combination. The half elf is an excellent balance between the two.
	Once you have entered the world of Norrath your first job is to visit your guild 
              master Hagar Sureshot. He is found close by in Surefall Glade behind the building. 
              Here you give Hagar the note that is in your inventory; in return he will admit you to
              the ranger guild and give you your guild tunic. You can spend your five practice 
              points that you get each time you level up here. I tend to use those on a trade 
              related skill or once your level is high enough on little extras such as kick. Your basic 
              skills such as 1 handed slashing, offense, & defense will improve as you fight so 
              spending valuable practice points on these is not necessary. After you have completed
              this equip your sword and venture forth to your first fight.

	The following is only a basic guide to provide ideas on how to start your character. I 
              leave all decisions up to you and your playing style. This is what worked for me and 
              may or may not work for you.

	As a level 1 character your best off fighting snakes and rats. Believe me they will be 
              tough enough for you. Before you initiate any combat you should target  the creature
              and consider it. If it cons yellow or red leave it until you are stronger. Anything less 
              should be a good if not tough fight. Fight all creatures until they con green. At this 
              point you will not get any experience from them. I still occasionally attack a decaying
              skeleton if it has a weapon in its hand. You can get better weapons and money for 
              them if you sell it. 
	Once you have reached level 4 you should be out exploring Qeynos Hills and been to
              near by Qeynos. As a recommendation avoid Black Burrow until you are at least level
             7 or in a party. It can be quite tough in there and is rather crowded.  At this point you
             should be able to attack giant rats, gray wolves, and gnoll pups no problem. 
	
              At level 5 you should be rather capable in a fight and with a party be able to take on
              creatures stronger than yourself alone. If you are in a good party you should consider 
             heading over to the plains of Karanas. Here you will gain experience quickly and collect
             valuable cat pelts which are used in the making of patchwork armor.
	
            At this point I will leave the rest up to you. You by now know what works for you and what
           you want to do as a player. Happy hunting and take care. Just remember we rangers and
          druids look after each other. If you see a young player offer some advice or if you can 
          spare give a better weapon or piece of armor. You never know when the great wheel will 
          come around and the same act will be returned by someone else.
