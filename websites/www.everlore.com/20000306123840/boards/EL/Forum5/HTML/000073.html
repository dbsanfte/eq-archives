</FONT><HR> Ok im just sick of this, people will say "oh <BR>wizs nuke for so much etc.." but maybe we can but does it do anything? Im lvl21 and i can only do 110dmg per spell because they made it so anything thats more powerful then other classes spells are resisted 100% by yellow and above and like 50% for blacks and below. And i see mages do 146dmg per spell at lvl21 too and plus their pet so they do more then us? Yea we can teleprt, but umm if we are supposed to be the best nukers why arent we? <BR>   Another thing they should really do something about medding time because the point of the game is not to stare at the screen of spells but fight. Either give us clarity or super-med or something so we don't hold up groups and waste half our time medding. Note: if you think about it we are the exact opposite of a warrior and only rely on mana and nothing else.<BR>  And this leads to my last point, as warriors have special items so should we, like nice wiz only int increasing items(A LOT of int, not like cyrosilk but along that range) Example: Robe of the High Wizard, Wizard's thinking cap etc..(and they should look cool!)<BR>   Ok thats about all i want to say and you can call me greedy and childish but anyone whos a wiz would agree with me totally. Call me names i don care i just want equality, and don't give me that crap about we nuke the best since we might do the most dmg but if you study you will see we rank 2nd or 3rd.<P>Your Friendly Neighboorhood Wizard on Quellious,<BR>Fauthon =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=5&topic=000073.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=Wizard|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Wizards+need+to+be+fully+upgraded">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>You are partially correct, wizards arn't really that great in DD compared to other classes below level 24.. 24 is when it starts to get good for us, and only gets better. You also have to take into consideration that wizards cast much much faster then magicians for less mana, and most times more damage. We are definatly best at nuking. At level 24 I nuke like a level 33 Magician ;-) Point being all classes have there good and bad levels. 12-16 is great for a wizard. 1-12, and 16-24 are very hard and trying  at times. <P>Vanta Elderblaze Lvl 26 wizard<BR>Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=5&topic=000073.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=Wizard|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Wizards+need+to+be+fully+upgraded">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>The above poster is one of the lucky few who has never had his team jumped by ssomething big, and consequently couldn't do a thing. You're completely happy about the resist cap, and think it works fine when lower level players can help when you can't.<P>That is a very interesting point of view.<P>All classes have their good and bad points. Yes, I agree (although I read a post on the necro board asking what "we as necros" have as bad points - replys all said that there aren't any - go read it. It's still there) BUT if you start posting responses like this where you compare classes, it's a mistake. Reason being that we are trying to get our class functional within a group setting. Which is to say, the resist cap problem.<P>I disagree with the first poster about "cool looking items", "wizard only items"...etc etc. He is shooting for too much, even if he was right. (yes, med-staring for 3 mins for a 1 min fight is not good design because players just don't enjoy that sort of thing - ???) You and I both know that isn't going to happen yet. So let's take one problem at a time, and see if we can make a diff to the class by talking to Verant and in-game feedback'ing. Verant staff would read a post like that, and get half way before stopping and close it, without reading further saying "this is ridiculous".<P>Neither you nor I wants that, I think you'll agree.<P>IF there is to be any difference made, we need to concentrate our efforts on one thing at a time. Right now we are like a group of crazed mice, with no direction or focus. And, as with all situations like that, will accomplish nothing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=5&topic=000073.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=Wizard|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Wizards+need+to+be+fully+upgraded">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>   Ok ok maybe im pushing for too much but the two things that piss me off the most are the resists against spells(they should increase to 10 lvls not 6) as its makes me feel REALLY useless when im trying to fight an avocet or a glyphed ghould in a group ad all i can do is use my strong tanking ablities? Also magic like force shoc and etc should not be resisted all the time, the resist should be close to flame shock.<BR>bUT THE medding time is a big problem. I dont understand why medding has to take so DAMN long but they should give a 20% decrease in the time for medding or something like that<BR>Fauthon<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=5&topic=000073.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=Wizard|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Wizards+need+to+be+fully+upgraded">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>ok guys, check this out. i'm a lvl 29 wiz, and its been rough goin to get here, but now, its GREAT. no questions asked, wizzies are the BEST nukers in the game at 29+. we nuke for 247dmg AND 10sec stun. also it takes a WHOPPIN 3.1 secs to cast, as opposed to the corrosponding mage spell 201dmg 5.3 secs to cast. also, i can nuke the crap out of anything lvl 0-35. i haven't been resisted ONCE with enfernoshock. i know the starting lvls are tough, but it REALLY pays off BIG TIME later. i agree they should lower resistances on lower lvl mobs, but i'd say, gut it out wizzies, cuz its gonna ROCK when ur here.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=5&topic=000073.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=Wizard|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Wizards+need+to+be+fully+upgraded">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>you "only" hit for 110 at lvl 21?  poor you... think about a mellee class, a monk or a warrior, they hit for, umm a whole 20 and a whole 50 (if warrior has a good weapon).  and then you get to mneditate, while warriors and monks have to sit their butts down for hours to recover hit points.   wouldn't you wish you'd have ice comet type of spells at lvl 1 just so that you're the pimp daddy of all classes, and the master kill stealer?  man, you're not supposed to kill everything in your way in one spell.  If you don't think your wizard is strong enough, go play a rogue, or try to solo a bard (also known as suicide) at 24 I have seen wizards that can take out yellow things.  for my monk at 24 to take out an even thing or make it at 25 to take on a lvl 24 creature it is called insta-death.  You don't get to complain about anyone kill stealing from you, you should be happy for that.  and for the love of God, why did you make a human wizard?  they are the worst for that class (an erudite or a gnome would be 10 times better)  that would be like a erudite or a gnome warrior, or a ogre wizard (well, not quite humans are a little smarter than that  <IMG SRC="http://www.everlore.com/boards/EL/smile.gif">.  take care ppl! (I wish I would find the time to egt my lvl 12 wizzy up to 24-28, it seems that that is where wizzies become super strong)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=5&topic=000073.cgi&ReplyNum=000008&forum=Wizard|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Wizards+need+to+be+fully+upgraded">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>Ok lets get this Wizards are the man your just playing em wrong we are not the focus of a team we are artillary and you have to have the right artillary for the fight.  If ya cant nuke it make it unhappy fire shield is a low lvl spell that is never resisted use it on the party.  I say we should get a few other buffs though not many just say one every other and clarity is a enchanter making spell ya know but maybe a weaker version say at 20th lvl or so because clarity is a oh my god type spell maybe a spell called focus  regen mana at 1.5 times rate for a short duration.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=5&topic=000073.cgi&ReplyNum=000009&forum=Wizard|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Wizards+need+to+be+fully+upgraded">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>WTF? At level 24 your complaining about only doing 120 damage?  Thats just sick.  You dont need updates, IMHO your perfectly fine.  So relax, there are other classes that need upgrades more than you, like clerics who need better cashflow and SOME SORT of DD that doesnt jsut effect undead and actually does half decent damage.<P>Jedekiah</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=5&topic=000073.cgi&ReplyNum=000010&forum=Wizard|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Wizards+need+to+be+fully+upgraded">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana"><A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum5&number=5&thisthread=000073&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum5&number=5&thisthread=000073&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
