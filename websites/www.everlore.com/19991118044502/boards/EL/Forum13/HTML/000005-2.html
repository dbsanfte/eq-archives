</FONT><HR>Pardon me Sir, but you are pathetic.<P>If you dont like the Paladin class, fine, go play your Mage.  Do you need to cut down the Paladin class to make yourself feel better?  That is truly sad.  Your that your selfish, power-gaming, non-helpful, arrogant attitude is very clear.  So you want to solo the whole game huh?  Why don't you go play something wihtout other real people in it if thats the case.  The best thing about MUDS, EQ etc.. is the interaction between people, your attitude is simply, ME ME ME!  For that reason, and many others you've shown us above I for one and very glad you AREN'T a Paladin.  You aren't cut out for it.... sir.<P>I'd ask that our fellow brother and sister Paladins dicontinue responses to this individual, he discraces our class simply to make himself feel better.

</FONT><HR>Again, some one has boiled down the "best class" to "This one has the best numbers" or "This one deals out the most damage"...which sounds similar to "My dad can beat up your dad" mentality.<P>The paladin is no good in soloing after 20th level.  I have yet to find this out with my paladin--  It's hard keeping track of all of them--  But, I think a paladin who solos follows one weird ethos.  You are the epitome of your god, and you don't want anyone else to see it?  Which god has a portfolio that is "isolation" and "don't talk to anyone else"?  What exactly did you think a paladin was meant for if it is not helping others?<P>Baffled at people's perceptions<BR>Awran Skullbearer (High Necromancer)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=13&topic=000005.cgi&ReplyNum=000027&forum=Paladin|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Mommas+Don|APO|t+Let+Your+Children+Grow+up+to+be+Paladins">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>You can solo very easy at 22+, its a little concept called ROOT, + ward undead...works great  <IMG SRC="http://www.everlore.com/boards/EL/biggrin.gif"> Goto Unrest, pull a carrion, or a Dry or some 2nd floor mob, be careful not to train, and root and blast that sucker till OOM then pound his skull in melee. I did it all the time until I found a group...do it when the zoneis packed though, so you dont get more then you can handle...and BTW, I can take 2 blues in unrest, like say a barbed bone and a skel monk with the assistance of my Ghoulbane. Spook one, kick the shit out of the other, which brings me to another great undead solo tactic...spook him and hit him from behind, do it again, etc. Sounds to me like those who say paladins can't solo in the 20's + just plain out suck at playing video games :P Use the abilities you have.<P>Metallicos</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=13&topic=000005.cgi&ReplyNum=000028&forum=Paladin|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Mommas+Don|APO|t+Let+Your+Children+Grow+up+to+be+Paladins">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>What happens if you want to hunt something besides undead. I mean, yeah, we can do it, but man it gets boring after a while! We do great at undead, but I would like not to be so one dimensional. Ghoulsbane is a great sword for the undead.

</FONT><HR>Hi folks  <IMG SRC="http://www.everlore.com/boards/EL/smile.gif">  <BR>I'VE READ EVERYTHING SO FAR AND LET ME START BY SAYING I HAVE A 19TH LVL PALADIN, 10TH LVL DRUID, 8TH LVL SHAMAN, 8TH LVL MONK, 7TH ENCHANTER, AMD JUST STARTED CREATING A WARRIOR.  I HAVE FUN WITH ALL OF THEM.<P>THE GUY WAS ROBBED BY THE GM'S AND SHOULD HAVE SAID HE DID IT WITH PPL HE HIRED. I KNOW I WILL.  HONESTY IN THE FACE OF STUPIDITY GETS YOU NOTHING EXCEPT WHAT HE RECEIVED. I AM SORRY HE WENT THROUGH THAT.<P>THE GM'S HERE ARE NOT VERY GOOD AND ARE NOT VERY HELPFUL IN ANYTHING. I HAVE DEALT WITH THEM AND FRIENDS HAVE ALSO AND WE BASICALLY NOW PETITION THEM TO PROVE THEIR WORTHLESSNESS.  THEN GO ON TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIX THINGS OURSELVES.  EVER TRIED A FEEDBACK?  I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED REPLIES TO ANY TO MY FEEDBACKS.<P>GM'S ARE THE ENEMY UNTIL THEY PROVE TO BE WORTH SOMETHING AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED.<P>AS FAR AS THE CHARACTER TYPES GO - I WILL SAY I HAVE FUN WITH ALL OF THEM AS I TRASH ALL THE REST HEHE -<P>AT LVLS 16TH TO 19TH I HAVE TRED SOLO WHERE NO ONE ELSE WILL GO:<P>ALL CASTERS AT MY LVL CANNOT WALK IN MY FOOTSTEPS.  THEY DIE TO MOST EVERYTHING I SOLO THAT IS BLUE RISKY AND HIGHER.<P>I LEAVE THE WARRIORS AND ROGUES BEHIND AS THEY SIT TO HEAL.  I HAVE HEALED MYSELF AND MOVED ON TO THE NEXT CRIT.<P>THE SHAMAN CANT WALK WITH ME BUT HE CAN CATCH UP LOL! (MY GHOD HOW I LOVE SOW <G>)<P>THE BARD TRIES TO KEEP UP BUT IS 2 STEPS BEHIND NOW AND FALLING FARTHER.  HIS HEAL IS MUCH LESS THAN MINE.  HE CATCHES ME WHEN I SPEND MAYBE 5 MINUTES TO MED SOMETIMES.<P>MY BROTHER THE CLERIC WALKS CLOSE BUT IS NOT WITH ME.  HE NEEDS A BETTER WEAPON ALSO SINCE NO ONE HAS ENOUGH MANA TO SUSTAIN THEM THROUGH A BATTLE.<P>THE MONK HAS NEITHER THE HIT POINTS OR THE HEALING TO STAY WITH ME, NOR THE SPEED TO CATCH UP. HIS MEND IS RISKY TO COUNT ON AT BEST. <P>I HOPE YOU ALL TAKE THE PRIOR WRITINGS IN THE LIGHT MOOD I MEAN IT TO BE.  STAY COOL FOLKS AND REMEMBER, ITS ABOUT FUN.<P> I DON'T BELIEVE I HAVE EVER LET A GROUP DOWN, AND NEVER PLAN TO STOP HEALING, AND CURING PPL AS I WALK THROUGH A TREMENDOUS GAME THAT IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS.<P>SPOILER TIME!<P>THE PALADIN - AS OF SEPTEMBER 18TH, 1999 - I STARTED THE QUEST FOR SOULFIRE AT LVL 18 - I TOOK A CLOTH TUNIC AND GAVE IT TO ALTUNIC, ON THE RUN BTW SINCE HE IGNORED HAILS AND DID GIVE ME THE TOKEN OF GENEROSITY WHILE STILL WALKING HEHE - THAT WAS A BIT TRICKY,<P> WHILE OUT THERE I LOOTED A POISON SAC, I TOOK BOTH BACK TO UM, DANG FORGOT HIS NAME - IN THE GRASSY AREA BEHIND THE HALL OF TRUTH - MERKOL?<P> ANYWAY - I HAILED HIM, WENT THROUGH ALL THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS UNTIL HE SAID WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE.<P>I GAVE THE TOKEN, HE TOOK IT AND GAVE ME EXP AND THE NEXT QUEST.<P>I GAVE THE POISON SACK, HE TOOK IT AND GAVE ME EXP AND THE NEXT QUEST.<P>I WENT RIGHT DOWN INTO THAT TUNNEL BELOW HIM AND KILLED THE SPY, LOOTED THE COIN AND WENT RIGHT BACK TO MERKOL<?>.<P>I GAVE HIM THE TOKEN AND NOW HAVE A TESTIMONY IN HAND.<P>I DID NOT DO THE LETTER TO THE GUY IN THE FREEPORT MILITIA HOUSE AT ALL.<P>I NEXT WENT TO FIND THE BEGGAR IN THE PORT BAR - I FORGET THE NAME.  I FIGURED OUT I HAD TO TIP THE BARD SINGING TO GET THE BEGGAR TO APPEAR.<P>I GAVE THAT BEGGAR 4 DROMS AND HE GAVE ME A BLANKET.<P>I WENT DOWN INTO THE WARRIORS CELLS AND FOUND THE UNNAMED PRISONER - GAVE HIM THE BLANKET, THE BOG JUICE I MADE ON SECOND TRY, AND THE GOO STUFF - SORRY I FORGET WHAT IT IS CALLED - MY GF MADE THAT FOR ME WITH A CHAR THAT HAD 10 SKILL.  EASY TO MAKE THE LAST TWO ITEMS.  THE PRISONER GAVE ME THE KEY.<P>I WAS ABLE TO GET SOW AND RAN OFF TO HIGHKEEP - I GAVE THAT KEY TO THE FEMALE BANK TELLER THERE AND SHE GAVE ME THE LETTER.<P>THAT IS WHERE I STAND AND I DID NOTHING LOWER THAN 18TH LVL AND DIDN'T DO HALF THE CRAP IN THAT QUEST SINCE IT IS ALL CRAP.<P>ONE PALADIN ASKED ME ABOUT IT AND I TOLD HIM HOW TO DO IT.<P>THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I AM GIVING THE INFORMATION OUT BECAUSE I FEEL THAT THE GAME HAS GIVEN US A BUM WRAP IN THE SWORD DEPARTMENT.  YOU CANNOT BUY HIGH LVL SWORDS FOR PALADINS.  A LOT OF WARRIORS ARE CRUISING WITH SOME SERIOUS STUFF BOUGHT FROM OTHERS.<P>I WOULD REALLY LIKE FOR SOME OTHER PALADIN TO TELL ME HOW TO CONTINUE ON TO GET THE BSOF.<P>SOULFIRE CAN CERTAINLY WAIT BUT I FEEL A PALADIN AT 20TH LVL - WHICH I WILL MAKE BY THE END OF THIS WEEK - SHOULD HAVE A DECENT SWORD AND TO ME THE BSOF IS IT.<P>I HAVE LOOKED EVERYWHERE AND CANNOT FIND THE STEPS ANYWHERE.  NONE OF THE PALADINS I TALK TO ON THE INNOURUK SERVER HAVE A CLUE THAT I HAVE SPOKEN TO.<P>I HAVE HEARD THAT ONLY ONE PERSON ON THE INN.

</FONT><HR>In response to what Jason said, I don't solo to be isolated. I solo for roleplaying reasons. In real life I'm somewhat of a loner, and hence my character follows along those lines. Furthermore, my complaint wasn't that paladins aren't good for soloing, it was that paladins aren't good for anything. Paladins are useless in parties with a cleric, since clerics spells are identical except for the fact that they get them earlier in levels. Paladins can't make up with thier loss at spell casting with combat ability either, since thier combat skills are only mediocre and honestly wouldn't be missed in the presence of a cleric. In other words, the cleric class makes paladins obsolete.<P>I'm not BASHING paladins, after all I am one.<P>I want to see paladins improved. I want to see paladins as an original part of the game instead of just weak warriors and weaker clerics. The Holy Knights of Norrath deserve more than that.<P>P.S. I'm ignoring all posts since Jasons since they all seem to be repetition.
