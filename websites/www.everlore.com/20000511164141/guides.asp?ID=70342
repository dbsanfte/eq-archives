  i was running around rivervale today and i was very bored, so i decided to take a trip to freeport.  i ran across kithicor and into the commonlands.. after a while i was in freeport.  i went to the bank and noticed my fishing pole there.  so i thought, "well, here is something to pass time."

  i ran down to the docks an started fishing.  after a few trys i cought a fish.  i went and sold the fish and noticed it sold for a little more than 1 silver.  i had no bait and figured bait would help me fish.  bait is 4 copper, and i had just sold my fish for 1 silver.  i could buy 2 cans of bait for that one fish, and then it hit me.  if you fish for a long enough time you can get quite a bit of money.  although this may take a while it's something to do if you're bored, and it wouldn't hurt to gain money!  i really don't know that much about what it's like to not have money because as soon as i started out people gave me equipment but i'm sure that lots of people would like to have a few plat just sitting in their pocket from fishing.  you can also get tattered cloth sandals, rusty swords, and fish scales from fishing.  my name in everquest is Clerik.  if you ever need a hand just send me a tell ;)
