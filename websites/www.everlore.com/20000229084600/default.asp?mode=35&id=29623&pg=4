			Apparently you need not to have much skill at all in blacksmithing to make this armor (thank god or I would have wasted around 500pp total) anyway two nights ago I finished gathering everything I needed for Ronium and had tons of money left to work on my blacksmith skill (which is 28) but didn't have time to do so and really wanted to finish the quest that night, so I figured I would go ahead with a luck roll, I put the ronium and the mold in the forge crossed my fingers and closed my eyes (lol) and clicked combine..... I opened my eyes again to a pair of greaves in my hand with my chat screen saying &quot;You have combined these items to make something new.&quot;<BR>
&quot;This item is trivial for someone of your skill.&quot; or something to that, so I suspect not much of a skill in blacksmithing is needed at all now...

			REPRIEVE!<BR>
Hello all interested Paladins,<BR>
I have completed two pieces of The Armor of Ro quest! The Breastplate of Ro, and the Greaves of Ro, are now mine! *does a little dance* And I bring you good news, and bad news, and some clarification on some REALLY erroneous posts about the Armor of Ro. <BR>
<BR>
First the good news; if you have your basics covered (been a good paladin and have made plenty of friends, got your masters in smithing, and got your faction appropriate) this quest isn't nearly as hard as it appears (although it is time consuming).<BR>
<BR>
Now, the bad news: a 50th level anything (except maybe a druid) could no solo this quest throught it's entirety (the MM cauldrons being the hardest part). So if you have a solo mentality, might as well give up now. However, a group of low 30's (POSSIBLY high 20's if they were really good) could do everything this quest asks for. <BR>
<BR>
Now for clarification on some seriously erroneous posts. First off, you do NOT need amiable or better faction to get the molds....indifferent faction will suffice. I was indifferent to both Elisabeth and Thomas, and received the molds and information I needed. With near opposing races, you will have apprenhensive faction, and THAT you will need to correct (alot of human pallies have apprehensive faction with the dwarves). You DO need amiable or better faction for the Temple of Solusek Ro (where you gain the Sol Cauldron to mix the Ronium). The best way to gain faction the fastest is NOT killing shadowmen, but taking derv rings (4 at a time) to the named orc in South Ro, and/or 30 GP to the named wizard in South Ro (they are in the same place, by a hut, in the north west part of the zone). This took me about 2 hours to accomplish the faction I needed (you can con the named orc to see if you have amiable faction with the temple). You have to mix both the Ronium AND forge the armor itself. The Ronium is not smith required I don't believe and is not NO DROP so someone can make this for you. However, the molds are NO DROP and while forging the armor was trivial at 102 smithing skill, I would not dare to try this at less skill for fear of failing to make it. To forge the armor, take the mold and Ronium to any forge, and combine them (NO WATER, just the mold and ronium will suffice). Finally, the Armor of Ro is not NO DROP, so you can wear it, sell it, drop it on the ground, whatever you like.<BR>
<BR>
The stats for the BP are as follows:<BR>
<BR>
20 AC +4 STR +10 Fire saves 5.0 weight with a steel look.<BR>
<BR>
The stats for the Greaves of Ro are:<BR>
<BR>
14 AC +6 Stamina +10 Cold 3.7 weight and steel look. <BR>
<BR>
This is how I accomplished the quest for these parts:<BR>
<BR>
For the greaves I needed a Nightfall Giants head. These are not that rare, and are not NO DROP so you can purchase them (50-200 PP I've seen for them). One of my guild's wizards gave it to me after practicing his Ice Comet spell in WC for awhile hehe. <BR>
<BR>
The materials for the Ronium:<BR>
<BR>
The melatite you can purchase (up to 1000PP I've seen it sold for). My group has been camping Solusek's Eye, an we gained it off a CWG model MA gnomebot (rare drop). It is my understanding that any of the gnomes/bots can drop it, just most common off the MC and MA models.<BR>
<BR>
The Soil of Underfoot is gained from the priestess Ghalea at Kaladim Clerics Guild, and you will need amiable or better faction and 4 faerie (not pixie) dust. The soil is NO DROP and LORE so you will return here after each piece of Ro you make (joy).<BR>
<BR>
Sands of Ro are an uncommon drop off of the Sand Giants of Southern Ro and Oasis. It is neither NO DROP nor LORE and you can usually get it for free from any SG killing group or purchase it (I purchased one for 50 PP).<BR>
<BR>
2 Bars of Enchanted Platinum you can buy from any alloy selling store and have enchanted by a high level enchanter. I don't know the price as it was given to me as a gift. 200PP per bar I believe though.<BR>
<BR>
MistMoore Granite is garnered off any of the gargoyles in MistMoore (most commonly dropped by the Flouting and Leering). This is drop is not THAT rare, as my party gained 9 pieces in a 4 hour camp. You will need a high level puller (druid pref) for this, or a tight low 30's party to camp inside the castle.<BR>
<BR>
Breastplate of RO item:<BR>
<BR>
Two Dark Cauldrons off the Ancille Cooks in MistMoore are needed for this. They sit right smack dab in the middle of the castle, so good luck (again low 30's party, camping and pulling from the correct room in MM should be able to accomplish this). I had a 50th ranger from my Guild (Jeygo you're the best!) and a 33 Paladin camping with me for this, and it was HAIRY! (WTB clean shorts). In a 4 hour span, we gained 5 cauldrons (uncommon drop). <BR>
<BR>
Boots of Ro:<BR>
<BR>
Needed are the Kilij plans off the unamed Sand Giant in Southern Ro. The only way to tell the difference is by conning it (conned black to me at 28th level). My group camped for it for 4 hours with no luck one night. Next night, while upping faction for Temple of Solusek, I ran right into it as it was beating up on a 31st level ranger. Between both of us we killed it (low 20's party could take this one no sweat). It doesn't have the HP or Damage that a full SG has  The Kilij plans are LORE but not NO DROP.<BR>
<BR>
Well that's one I've accomplished so far. Good luck to the rest of yas, and gimme a holler ifn ya needs help <BR>

			Just wanted to say thanks to the fella above who posted the correct info on making this armor.  I have made the gauntlets, the breastplate and the greaves so far and the last piece I desire are the arms.  Does anyone have more info on getting these diseased shark portions?  Where exactly does this &quot;plague shark&quot; spawn at?  How often does he spawn?  Is it necessary to kill the Killer sharks?  I would really like these arms and already have the ronium ready and waiting.  Thanks for any help you could provide!<BR>

			Greetings fellow Paladins!<BR>
The Ro armor: At least it looks good. All Id like to know is if the stats have changed since last update (20th january). Ive been in SK for 3 days now, constantly shouting if the sentry was seen. No replies :(<BR>
NM. If any of the stats have been changed plz write it here. If not write &quot;No changes&quot; or something like that.<BR>
<BR>
If you have any questions about whatever send a tell<BR>

			To obtain the armor of ro you need no smithing skill. It was soon changed after all the paladins were complaining that they were the only class that needed a trade skill to make there armor.<BR>
<BR>
All pieces of armor require one mold of the desired piece, and one bar of Ronium (no water).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
BP of RO:<BR>
You will need 2 dark couldrins from the cooks in MM castle. i would sugest getting your 7 pieces of granate while your deep getting the couldrins. You trade the 2 couldrins to the High Elf paladin in rathe mountains for a mold.<BR>
<BR>
Grieves or RO:<BR>
The grieves of ro require one nightfall giant head. This giant spawns at nightfall in WC, wandering around the druid ring usually, and is there till it is killed or till day time. You turn this in for the Grieves mold.<BR>
<BR>
Boots of RO:<BR>
The boots of ro require the plans for the Braizen Brass Kilji, a rather nice weapon if you use the plans to obtain the sword instead of the boots, that is one of the reasons this part is more difficult. The giant that drops the plans is killed by the merchants in SRO, and some of the high level twinkers want the sword for there twinks, this is one of the more interesting parts to get. You turn the plans to the dwarf paladin for the Boots mold.<BR>
<BR>
Helm of RO:<BR>
The helm of ro is obtained by killing the undead cyclopses in SK, as far as i have seen these cyclopses spawn at night and stay till killed, however they mey poof at day break. you will need two of the skulld which you turn in for the Helm mold.<BR>
<BR>
Gauntlets of RO:<BR>
The locket off the sentry in SK is needed for the gauntlets, i dont remember the name, sory, but he spawns randomly anytime, when night falls however the becomes a wearwolf. I have only killed him in human form but i bleieve that if you kill him in wearwolf form you dont get the faction hits. you turn the locket in for the gauntlet mold.<BR>
<BR>
Bracers of RO:<BR>
These are obtained by getting 2 nets off the net master goblins in Lake rathe. They basicly swim in a big circle around the lake. However currently they DWK faction needed to get the mold from David is still broken, try haveing an enchanter turn in the stuff for the mold and makeing the bracer, or wolf form. I used wolf form and it worked fine for me, but some of my friends told me it didnt work for them. You turn in the 2 nets to david for the bracer mold.<BR>
<BR>
Vambraces of RO:<BR>
You need 2 rottin portions from the plauge sharks in eruds crossing. This is the only piece i have yet to get so i really cant give to much info on how to find the sharks. Any information you have wold be appriciated. You turn in the 2 portions for the Vambraces mold.<BR>
<BR>
As i stated before, all you put into the forge is one mold and one bar of ronium. <BR>
<BR>
Have fun, and i hope this helps some.
