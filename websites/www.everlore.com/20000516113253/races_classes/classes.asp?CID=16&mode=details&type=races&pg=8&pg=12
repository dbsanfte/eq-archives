				The shadowknight is known as Paladin of Evil. For that, you may never be able to stand with NPC Paladin and Cleric.KoS(kill on Sight).... lotta KoS.You will get used to it. avoid any npc that says scowls at you... or they will attack you..<BR>
Yes, you get lots of KoS.Then why should you play SK? There are some reasonable reasons.<BR>
First of all , you can have a pet and you are a fine warrior youself.However your pet is much weaker than you .You will have to tank to protect your pet but having a pet helps you a lot.<BR>
Second , you have harm touch while Paladins have LOH(Lay ON Hand).The damage of harm touch depends on your level.(If you are level 10,the harm touch will do around 100 damage to monsters that con green and blue and black. Yellow and red might resist your harm touch.)<BR>
<BR>
Last ,you may look cool. There aren't many shadowknight in EQ world.Lotta people shout &quot;level # mage looking for a group&quot;,&quot;level # druid looking for a group&quot;,&quot;level #ranger,wizard,monk looking for a group.&quot; and you will shout &quot;level # shadowknight looking for a group&quot;. It may look cool that you are different from the others.<BR>
Once again, beware of being KoSed.

				Shadow Knights are regarded by many as the easiest (and possibly the only) combination able to solo effectively. This does not preclude grouping of course, but at least it gives you the option to take on enemies if there is no-one around to group with.<BR>
<BR>
You can play your SK two ways - as a Human/Dark Elf and concentrate more on the Necromancer side - or as a Troll/Ogre and concentrate more on the Warrior side. I would recommend playing as a Troll for various reasons.<BR>
<BR>
As a magic user you don't get any spells until level 9. The spells you get then, and even the spells you get at level 15, are not powerful and are merely additionally helpful rather than being hugely useful. Therefore it is important to be an effective warrior rather than a spell caster - at least until later levels anyway. <BR>
<BR>
Your pet will never be able to tank for you - it will never be good enough - so being able to stand in the thick of it and take damage, and enable your pet to get a few additional blows in, is the best way to go.<BR>
<BR>
Ogres will always be better at pure fighting than Trolls - however I would strongly recommend Trolls rather than Ogres for the simple reason of Regeneration. As a SK you don't get any kind of healing spell until at least level 22 - and that means (unless you are fortunate to constantly group with a shaman or, God forbid, a Cleric/Bard/Paladin) a lot of down time sitting waiting for your hp's to return. Trolls heal at least twice as fast and this means you will be up and ready for combat much earlier than Ogres, or any other Warrior type races, for that matter.<BR>
<BR>
TSK's are great fun, the exp point penalty for being one does not seem to be excessive - I got to level 16 in about 5 days of playing (total time, not in one sitting obviously) and this does not seem to be much longer than most other races although I would expect there are many out there who have done vastly better and would disagree with me. I died a lot, unfortunately - but don't let me put you off - you will die a lot whoever you are.<BR>
<BR>
Above all enjoy it - whatever race you chose. And Bash All Dat Yu Sie...

				I have a comment to make and opinion and well would like to see what someone<BR>
else thinks.<BR>
I have run a paladin on everquest untill that of 9th lvl and then I began to<BR>
run its counter part anti paldain so to speak shadow knight. A little look<BR>
into what the paladin and shadow knight are, paldins are 1/4 cleric and 3/4<BR>
warrior and shadow knights are 1/4 necromancer and 3/4 warrior so to speak.<BR>
The problem I am having is that well paldins have a special ability to lay<BR>
hands which is a heal of hp which works everytime once a game day. Now its<BR>
evil brother gets what is called a death touch which is a special power to<BR>
do damage that goes up as does the lvl of the SK but in contrast this<BR>
special power is resistable, why? Well in my opinion this is a special power<BR>
and shouldn't be resistable just like his goodie to shoes brother the<BR>
paladins lay hands. Either that or maybe the paladins lay hands shout have a<BR>
chance of failure then?<BR>
Also the paladin gets heal spells and such as he should , but the SK does<BR>
not get his version of this which is lifetap which is steal life from target<BR>
and add to yours why is this?<BR>
I think this is just a little much having a class that is suppose to be<BR>
equal to another but just of an evil aspect but yet besides being condemed<BR>
by all and the hardships of be shuned by all NPC's or attacked by them you<BR>
cant even heal yourself and must sit around for 20 to 30 min to heal after<BR>
big battles.<BR>
I feel that if these 2 minor flaws in the character where to be corrected it<BR>
would make for a much more rounded game play. Send me any opinions on this<BR>
maybe convince me why it shouldnt be this way.<BR>

				I have Played all the melle classes at least to level 8(the monk I have is level 8) And most over 10 I have a 20th level warrior, a 13th level Ranger and I deleted a 12th level paladin.. I Started an SK on friday evening and made Level 9 last night, (about 12 hours total playing time, I had to put a level on my Enchanter (13) in the mean time so I couldnt spend all the time on the SK.) The Monk is cool.. but ladies and gentlemen, If you want to play a mellee class, and can live with being evil, SK is the way. It completely spanks the other Melee classes AS IS. The Monk is the only one close. Harm Touch may be usable once a day, but has kept me alive MANY times. and a few times it didnt keep me alive, it at least let me burn down an opponent so I did nt lose as much. This may get worse as time goes on, and I will see.. But from the looks of it now, with the spells, pet and Harm.. it is a brutal combo. If you need to be good, Well, I suggest a monk. Paladins and Rangers get some nifty stuff, but nothing spectactular (except for maybe the  holy swords) and Warrior simply dont do enough damage to be effective. I dust mine off only for special occations as he is the highest level character in my arsenal. (he is also my smith..)

				I am a troll SK and here are my observations:<BR>
1. KOS is bad.  I even work hard on my factions within my roleplaying context to small effect.  I spent about 2 weeks in BlackBurrow killing over 1000 gnolls for Qeynos factions only to find out that Corrupt Qeynos Guards will still KOS me even though I am now aimibale with good guards, so I still cant go in city.<BR>
2. Trade skills: forget it.  Not a single oven, kiln, forge, etc. in Grobb and you get KOS in some places in Oggok and Neriak you have 3 zones that you have to walk in duck mode due to tiny inkie doorways - that is painful!<BR>
3.  Harm Touch - better at earlier levels, always useful.  Gets resisted by reds, which makes sense cuz so do wizards spells and physical damage - this keeps you from killing above your level and gaining exp beyond your means, which makes sense.<BR>
4. Pet - only to add damage and take that 2nd Sand Giant hit when you get ambushed meditating so you have time to run away and live!<BR>
5. Regeneration - awesome at early levels, always useful.  Combining Regen with Harm Touch makes the first few levels for a SK a joke because the HT will take over 20% of a mobs total HP and your regeneration as a percentage to total HP early on is incredible.  I watched myself regenerate over two full bubbles during the course of a battle at an early level, 40% more HP for a fight!<BR>
6. Faction with PCs is what makes this class my favorate!  With just a little bit of roleplaying you become a character in Human lands that is unforgettable and everyone remembers you and enjoys your company, I am always being asked to group with others yet the class is still able to support solo play effectively.

				I started Dumdum as a troll Shadow Knight to see what he could do, ended up liking the character and kept him. I am currently a level 12 TSK on the veeshan server. For those wanting some info and a guide of sorts, here goes;<BR>
<BR>
1. You are whats called kill on sight (KOS) even in you own swamp, there are npc's that will kill you especially at lower levels. Identify and con everything.<BR>
<BR>
2. Become familiar with the zone you are playing in, you may need to run to a troll guard for help, later you may need to run to a zone period. <BR>
<BR>
3. keep your back to a wall if possible when in battle, that way you do not get attacked from behind, everything in the swamp assists. you can and will at times get ganged by 10+ froggies and/or kobolds.<BR>
<BR>
3. If you know you are going to die do not run, you probably know where you are, but will get lost trying to get away. Be sure to use /loc before you go unconcious. <BR>
<BR>
4. Practice Hand to hand on occasion, this may save your live when running back to your corpse.<BR>
You will not get dual wield, so sorta specialize in 2handed weapons, may as well go for max damage. I used a long sword for a while and was still not able to wear a shield.<BR>
<BR>
5. Oh, almost forgot, don't waste anymore than 1 practice session sense heading ( darn near useless ) I still fail 39 out of 40 attempts.<BR>
<BR>
6. Stay out of GUK until you are lev 12 - 13. You may be able to kill a tad or sentry, but believe me the trains that follow the high levelers will get you killed. ( you will die enough on your own ).<BR>
<BR>
7. when going up against anything that casts spells, you will get a warning, once it says so and so starts to cast a spell, use slam, if it hits it interrupts the casting. This will get better as your slam/bash skill increases.<BR>
<BR>
8. I you don't want to run solo, find a consistant group to play with, you get to know how they work and react.<BR>
<BR>
9. when playing in sourthern ro, watch out for the char's headed for Guk, most are SOW'd (spirit of the wolf) and are dragging any number of things behind them. when you see them, move to the next hill, I have been a spot on the bottom of a sand giant foot more than once because of this. <BR>
<BR>
10. I posted this because i could find nothing like it when i was looking, so its up to you if you want to follow this, it worked and is still working for me, it may or may not work for you. Either way, enjoy and believe me i have much more fun with this char than i ever did running a barbarian.<BR>

				Nice post by DumDum except sense heading is far from useless. If you work it it becomes a lifesaver. I speak from expierence, Mine is at 140 right now and it workes 95percent of the time. It some zones it doesn't help but in anyone of the open areas its great for many things. Just keep working it I have it hotkeyed to my attack so when I start attacking I hit sense heading. Also when you meditate you have nothing better to do then hit sense heading.

				Dumdum's guide Part 2<BR>
<BR>
Just a note to Grilli, thanks, got sense heading up to 30 now. Once you get above 12 or 15 it seems to increase faster.<BR>
<BR>
1.  Practice taunt, it will save your party members lives, although this seems not to work if they are to far gone or running away.<BR>
<BR>
2. become familiar with what your spells do, your siphon strenght takes strenght from your victim and gives it to you (once). If you continue to cast the spell you will notice it says the the victim weakens. Hit them with disease, you will only do 5 points of non-melee damage but i have noticed the spell also prevents them from regenning hp.<BR>
<BR>
3. Using harm touch to kill a scarab, ok, but i would advise not doing that in an area that has multiple aggro mobs. Many times i was taking out a derv and that mummy or dry bone skeleton (DB) would start hitting me from behind. A group of three or four lev 12 to 17 trolls can take out that DB but your harm touch will save a party member. don't waste it, at higher levels.<BR>
<BR>
4. Don't pass up any decaying skeletons or normal skeletons, you will find that a supply of bone chips comes in handy for creating your pet.<BR>
<BR>
5. Your pet is not a tank, (haven't tried this at 15 yet) countinuosly hit taunt to keep it from getting killed. If you need to run for a zone your victim will focus on your pet, giving you a chance to run. This will not work if you get into a battle will multiple mobs, count on you pet biting the dust in 2 or 3 hits.<BR>
<BR>
6. ok, biggie here.... do not complete a quest where you get exp when grouped, Exp will be with party memebers, wait until you disband to complete quests.<BR>
<BR>
7. Stay out of human camps, do not forget you are a troll and KOS. HEH HEH, I tried to walk into a gypsy camp to check out the wares, died 2 times getting corpse back. Make a Corpse hot key so you can drag corpse while moving backwards, this will save you a lot of stopping to type /corpse when trying to get corpse out of an aggro area.<BR>
<BR>
8. Im trying to get my beg skill up, be careful NPC merchants will attack you. Found that out the hard way too. Beg seems to work better on npc's that don't con red. I actually went up 1 point. Have yet to get anything from begging.<BR>
<BR>
9.  Level 15 now, and guess what, I finally resisted my first rabies spell. now have endure cold, and that let me resist some frost rift spells. have not noticed if damage is less at this point. more on this later.<BR>
<BR>
10. South Ro Desert, you will want to avoid these mobs unless in a group 4 or more, and even then someone will probably die: Crypt mummies, Dry bones Skeletons, Casting Dervs, Casting madmen, Terrorantula, Named NPC's.<BR>
<BR>
11. If you take these mobs on in a group, co-ordinate your attack, let the tank take the hits, if you have no healer in the group this is where taunt will save his life. If you take on groups of mobs ALWAYS take out the caster first. There is nothing like being hit for 1 -10 points and watching your hp bar slide over half way because all of a sudden you get hit by spells that take 20-30 hp a pop.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this helps some, more when i hit level 20<BR>
<BR>
