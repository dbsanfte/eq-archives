<!--<tr><td><font face="verdana">I was reading through some of these guides and I noticed that the ones for rangers seemed to end around level 15.  Well, there's plenty more to do after that, and I thought I'd give you a few tips.  A lot of these are things that I learned the hard way, either by not doing them or doing them too late.

First, lets talk about spells.  Following your level 15 spells you get new ones at level 22 and then at 30.  The 22nd level spells are nice, especially your enhanced healing.  Another often overlooked spell is Harmony.  While it can go wrong sometimes, and cause some serious pain, when it works well it can pay off big time.  I owe my Rubicite greaves, in part, to harmony.  Try to get used to using it, even if it means taking a few lumps.  Your other two nice spells at that level are Skin like Rock, which is going to last you till 39, and Ignite, which does 37 points of damage, up from 15 points.  

Now, 30th level spells.  Frankly, don't get too excited.  Your new damage spell is Stinging Swarm, a great spell that does about 3x the damage of ignite in DoT format (120 points), however it is conjuration.  It is very important that you not put any training points into conjuration until 30th level, because when you put your first point into a skill, it starts at your current level. When I got my spells at 9th I put a point into every magic school, so my conjuration started at 9.  Rangers get no conjuration spells until 30th, so if I had waited my skill would have started 21 points higher.  Working it up is a real pain so please heed my advice, I fizzle all my mana without a single success often, though it's slowly increasing.  Another tip is not to bother buying Eyes like Cat.  It grants infravision, so I foolishly bought it thinking that I could use it to help my human and barbarian friends.  It's self only, and if you're a woodelf, it's absolutely uselss.  It's also your most expensive spell, at about 14pp.  My two favorite spells at 30th are Strength like Earth, to make up for the weak wood elf, and Barbcoat, cause at this point you're really hurting for plate (unless you're lucky enough to have a full suit of rubi) and you can take all the armor class you can get.

Now, having dealt with spells briefly, lets talk about some good places to hunt between levels 20 and 30.  Being from Faydwer, i spent a great deal of time in Unrest during the early 20's.  There's simply lots to kill there, and excellent loot that will keep you well provided for.  As you approach the mid 20's you may be willing to give up the nice loot and look for something that just gives pure easy XP.  My suggestion is taking a trip to Lake Rathetear.  There are aviak islands there were you can kill as many as you like and you never lose faction with them.  It's also generally a pretty quiet area so not much competition.  From about level 23+ you can also venture to Mistmoore, where the XP is fantastic, though there's a lot of danger.  I'm a big fan of the place personally, and you can adventure there well up until about 30th.  At that point you need to have a good group prepared to move into the graveyard, as the enemies near the opening of the zone are all green, and those deeper may rip your heart out.  From about level 25+ there is also Cazic Thule.  Everyone wants to go there because they assume that Rubi will just fall into their lap.  Not so, the higher levels (30+) are usually all over the rubi spawns, but there is still lots to do there.  First and foremost is pulling from the Maze.  There are lots of lizards that drop plat, and bronze and FS are everywhere.  Just watch out for trains, though I've never found Cazic trains as bad as Mistmoore and Unrest ones.  The Lizards there are mostly melee types, and their casters occasionally smite, but mostly heal themselves.  It's a pain, but you're usually not getting hit with huge damage spells, which everyone can appreciate.

As for 30th and beyond, Unrest has gotten really tiresome (and overcroweded as all the small races rush there to get bronze plate, and the lack of easy pulls caused by that makes people do riskier ones, which usually results in nasty trains of hags and the like).  Your two best bets are Mistmoore and Cazic Thule for the next while, until you can venture into Lower Guk.

My plans?  Well I'm going to check out Permafrost again, since I haven't been there in a long time, and now I can probably handle much more.

Remember though, a Ranger cannot really solo, a good party is your life's blood.
