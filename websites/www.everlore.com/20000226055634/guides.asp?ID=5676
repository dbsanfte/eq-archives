<!--<tr><td><font face="verdana">I played a wizard for a very long time, and became quite used to the root and nuke method for soloing.  Its risky and when that root fails, death will follow if you can't stick him again.
But now I play a cleric.  Of course the best way to solo is against undead.  Clerics have the burn power of a wizard and the melee power... well some melee power against undead, making them a perfect choice.
Most clerics will root, Ward, and then finish off on melee.  But there is a far better way.
Few people see the usefulness of Spook the Dead, a simple level 1 spell that makes an undead monster run away (the duration is based, randomly, on how powerful the creature is.  A level 15 cleric can SSpook a decaying skeleton for quite a while, but a ghoul won't be running too long).
Instead of root and nuke, use spook and nuke!  Use Sense Undead to find some undead, it works great on the south end of North Ro.  Go near them, and from maximum distance, cast a Ward Undead.  The creature will come running at you (albeit slow for the less-than-agile undead), and then cast Spook before it gets to you.  Unless you get a rare resist, it will turn around and run.
This is where the fun begins.  Follow it and pound it with your weapon, and then as soon as you can cast again, Ward it.  Melee it as it runs until the spell recycles, and then Ward it.  Spook will then run out, but you can recast it quickly.  Its a quick spell to cast, and your armor should protect you for a few tries while you re-Spook.  When its running again, pound its back and keep Warding it.
Using this method, I can easily solo yellow undead, often using only 3 bubbles of mana and barely using any HP.

Some other tips on clerics:  Put all of your points into Wisdom.  NOTHING else matters.  Strength?  Put the remaining points here, but no more.  Sure armor is heavy, but your mana is more important than your armor.  Also, picking a high elf cleric is the best choice.  You can get 130 wisdom with a high elf cleric, while most other clerics have 100 wisdom.  Thats 23% more mana with a high elf.  Nearly a bubble and a half more mana.  When the fights get close and each heal counts, imagine how much more thats going to help.
Mana is a clerics game.  When you're level 30 and trying to join a group, which is going to be the more desirable cleric:
Cleric A: "Cleric seeks group! I have 120 strength and can carry lots of loot and get hit with all my armor (if I had a way of making the monster angry enough to hit me)!  But I can't help much with melee, and oh yeah, I can only heal a few times since I don't have much mana."
Cleric B: "Cleric seeks group! I have MAXIMUM wisdom, and plenty of mana.  I can heal like crazy, and even take some hits, since I do have some armor.  With me you will live 20% longer than other clerics!"
Clerics can be a great help in melee up to level 10 or so.  Since they only get 4 points of melee skills per level, it really stacks against them past this point.  By higher levels, it becomes worthless to even carry a weapon, just have a nice mana or wisdom increasing item instead.

Well thats all for now.</font></td></tr>-->
