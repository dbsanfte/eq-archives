			<font face="verdana" size="2" color="black">  In the Druid temple in the back of the zone is Gerael Woodone, a guildmaster.  Hailing him results with him asking you if you'll ever be in the plains of Karana, and if you'd be interested in [delivering a flask].  Responding with &quot;I will dilver a flask.&quot; activates his response.  He wants you to deliver a flask of nitrates to a Linaya Sowlin, located in West Karana (location -3744.24, -7663.28).<BR>
<BR>
Upon delivery of the nitrates to Linaya, she mentions that she had a run in with a fellow while at a nearby merchants shop, and that he droped a [note] which she picked up and read.  It talked of the [Unkempt Druids], but before she could get any details it was snatched away.  She's frightened now, and would like for you to stay for a little while just in case he shows.  The villan is Draqze Slashyn, who is a member of the Unkempt Druids.  He challenges her to come out so he can kill her.  You have to act quickly, else he disappears.  He was a easy kill for me at 20th level.  On his corpse you find a note that reads &quot;To all Unkempt Druids;  Jake Phlintoes calls uopon you to seek out the Surefall Ambassador to Qeynos.  His name is Gash Flockwater, reward upon delivery of his head.&quot;  You then take this note back to Gerael Woodone in SFG.  For giving the flask and note you get exps and faction, not a whole lot but then again I was 20th when I started this.  Now comes the frustrating part.<BR>
<BR>
Gerael wants you to take the same note to Cpt Tillian in South Qeynos, and to warn Gash.  After you give the note to Tillian, he tells you to find Gash at the Lion Mane's inn and inform him [they are trying to kill him].  When you get to the Lion Mane's inn, go down the hall just behind the female innkeeper, all the way to the end just before the stair case.  Turn left, this is Gash's room.  Hail him and he will confirm that he is the same Gash that you think he is (Doh!).  Then he gets attacked by a Druid and Gash fights back.  Again, this Unkempt Druid conned green to me at 20th level.  He and Gash will go at it, but the Druid will run if he starts losing.  This is where it gets tricky (or may be broken).  <BR>
<BR>
You have to time your attacks (spell prefably) so that you are the one who kills the Druid, otherwise Gash immediately loots the body.  In either case though, he says that this Druid dropped something, and that you should take it back to Gerael.  The syntax is a bit broken, so it's hard to figure out what exactly to do, and there are no bracketed key words.  <BR>
<BR>
I have done this quest 5x now.  The first two times Gash killed the Druid before me, and I tried everything I could think of to get him to give me this fallen item.  I even whipped out a lightstone to fully illuminate the inside of the inn, went from top to bottom, and found no items lying around anywhere.  Even when I timed the spell casting so that I was the one who felled the druid, all I ever got was some silver and a rusty dagger.  In each instance Gash says the guy dropped somethign that you should take back to SFG.  Each time I have not been able to find it.  <BR>
<BR>
If anyone can tell me if I'm doing something wrong, I'd greatly appreciate it.  Or, if anyone else has had the same problem, then I'd also like to hear this as obviously then the quest is broken and the GMs should be notified.  TIA.<BR>

				Killing Gash seems like a counter-productive idea.  I'm not just after the item or exp, faction is a consideration too.  Besides, from everything I've heard, killing a quest NPC that isn't obviously someone you're supposed to kill nets you nothing worth any while.  But even if it did, I still wouldn't do it as it's against character concept.

				1. Raffel has Dialogue that he says and responses from other NPC's as you follow him. (inn keep throught the wall and the barkeep at the fish ale tavern).<BR>
2. Killing Gash nets you nothing but a bad faction hit. <BR>
3. If you let Raffel Kill Gash (which he needs no help doing). the whole cycle repeats. Raffel leaves the inn and procceeds to start over (dialogue mentioned in #1). Gash respawns and it all happens again. <BR>
4. Killing Raffel at any all 4 stages produces (before dialogue, after 1st dialogue, after second dialogue, after attacking Gash)nothing.<BR>
5. Since you can start the quest regardless of level a level limit should not be a concern.<BR>
6. Mentioning &quot;What about Unkempt Druids&quot; to Gleneal Woodone, in surefall glade, produces a rant about Jale Phlintoes. As I have never seen this person I can't say where to look, Woodone mentions nearby lands, (most people assume this to be the karanas or the hills. I think it may mean, Kerra Isle or Toxxulia (just my opinion). <BR>
7. The only key phrase that doesn't go to anyone is from the druid (woodone) in Surefall when he says (They intend on killing him). <BR>
8. Following all the catchphrases produces nothing new. <BR>
<BR>
On a Side note, after I saw another player kill a begger outside of the gates in N Qeynos the begger said &quot;...Long live the green...&quot;, this has been thus far relating to unkempt druids(I asked the person who killed him and he had nothing more then a rusty dagger and some silver...the same remains off Raffel Minnmorn). Which also reminds me on Tadan Nybright quest in Kelethin (hailing him normally does nothing but when you hail him &quot;Hail Tadan Nybright&quot; he will give you the quest for his daughters...just a thought to keep in mind...since Jale doesn't want to be found).<BR>
<BR>
I haven't given up on the quest but I don't know where else to go. It is either elusive OR broken of either I can't say. It is rumored that this is the Oaken Scimitar Quest, however Brad has already stated that the Oaken Scimitar is NOT in the game. <BR>

				Jale Phlintoes sounds like a halfling druid.  Anyhow, I think searching the area of for a &quot;dropped&quot; item might be an good idea.  The assassin spawns from the West passage connecting N.Q. to S.Q., maybe you should retrace the step between the passage to the lion's mane.  Also, if you hail the assassin, he would say he is going to make a FORTUNE out of this.<BR>
<BR>
I have see a &quot;wood chip&quot; on a vendor in Felwithe.  It's not &quot;treant wood chip&quot;, nor &quot;blacken wood chip&quot;, just &quot;wood chip&quot;.  I will log on tonight and try to purchase it (if it's still there), maybe it is the quest chip.

				Greetings all!  <BR>
<BR>
I to have done this quest repeatedly but have not found the black wood chips on the assassin nor anywhere on the ground after he is killed.  I refuse to kill Gash to see what he holds, but from reading here I guess he holds nothing anyway which is good. :) <BR>
<BR>
The Jale Phlintoes (sp?) I believe is in Rathe Mountains at the druid ring, but I would have to go back and check to make sure.  He gives a new weapon quest so I'm not sure if anyone would want to kill him or not.  <BR>
<BR>
A couple of things stuck in my mind about this very frustrating quest.<BR>
<BR>
1) Gash says that you should give Woodone ANY black wood chip and that all Unkempt Druids carry them.  No one that I know of that has hunted the Unkempt Druids (even the named ones) in Rathe Mountains has gotten a black wood chip from them, but I've never tried the druid in South Karana.<BR>
<BR>
2)  The second thing is when you talk to Gash (I think or Tillin) he says something to the affect of stop the assassin before he gets to Gash.  That made me think that you needed to kill the assassin before he engaged Gash, but even doing this gives no wood chips.  *shrugs*  <BR>
<BR>
I guess I'll visit the druid in South Karana or maybe there's some keyword we're missing that makes Gash give you what Raffel dropped...<BR>
<BR>
I wish you all luck and no the Oaken isn't ingame or it wasn't before this last huge patch.  The one person that has it got it from someone that shouldn't have had it in the first place, but the GMs said they wouldn't take it from this person so they are the proud owner if the one and only Oaken in existance so far.  :)<BR>

				I was searching for Quests, and came upon a Heart Quest in West Karana. It was told that a Unkept Druid was attacking people and after they killed her got her heart from it. Now, I haven't done the Quest myself, or seen her, But it could be a step in the direction for this quest.
