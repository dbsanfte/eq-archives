----------------------------------------------
PART ONE

Stradholm, Barbarian Shaman
AKA Jeff

 Thinking about it now...playing a Barbarian Shaman is a true Love / Hate ordeal.
 Mostly it is beacuse the Shaman is confused about his roll in life. 
Is he a Warrior? Is he a spell caster? Something in between? Well, that decision is really up to you. My advice would be to balance your Shaman as best you can.
 This guide will walk you through the first levels of your Shamans life.
Hopefully your will be able to progress quickly and efficiently with the insite (and hindsite) I have provided for you.

  Starting out...

 Well, when your Shaman is first Born, you will want to go strait to the Shaman Guild. I am not going to give you any Spoilers like where everything is, after a while BELIEVE me you will know your way around!
 First thing you need to do is memorize your first free spells: Minor Healing and Inner Fire. Also put a point in Sense Heading and save the rest.
 From here on out, you will want to save you level points for later levels.
Ok, now you are ready! The first levels are really going to be boring.
Stay right out front from the merchant camp and fight gnoll pups and Ice goblin whelps from level 1 to 4. Sell loot you get up at the merchant tents, also, if you get in trouble you can run up to the two guards to save your
bacon...
 
  Level 5...

 Finally! Now, you will have some cash, and a whole lot of new spells open to you! Frost Rift and Summon Drink are important, but Gate is a must have. This way, no matter where you are you can teleport back to the entrance to Halas.
 You probably have made a couple friends by now. You will NEED some friends now...hopefully they will want to group with you and make a trip to Black Burrow.
 You are not actually going to go IN Blackburrow (BB, as it is called), but hunt around the entrance and the surronding area. The Scrawny Gnolls and Gnoll
Guards are good exp, but tough, be careful. Two spawn outside the entrace, and two more inside..most will carry some weapons that sell for good cash. You will also be able to get a Rusty Mace or Worn Great Staff here.
 Hunt the Gnoll Pups, Polar Bear cubs, Ice oblin Whelps, and Decaying Skeleton that wander around as well...the skeletons are good cash cows, since they might have weapons and bone chips to sell. This is going to be your stomping grounds until level 9.
 Also, you will want to be equiping yourself with Leather Armor around this time.
 


(Note: At Level 8 you will be able to get the Meditate Skill...DO THIS! You will regain Mana, memorize spells, and Scribe Spells MUCH faster.)

  Level 9
 
 Ahh! this is the level where all your trouble pays off. This is when you get some truely great spells...Spirit of Wolf, which everyone is going to bug you 
to cast on them, Summon Food, and a couple of 'secret' spells.
 Make a trip to Queynos with about 6 platinum peices and head to the Herb Shop. They don't like barbarians there, so get an enchanter to buy you Serpent Sight.
This spell will cast Infravision on you and your freinds, so you can see at
night!
 Also, in the Plains of Everfrost at some ruins is a NPC selling poison spells. You will want to buy Tainted Breath from him...very nasty poison spell.
 With level 9 under your belt, you might want to go into BlackBurrow (which is crowded, and you most likely will die) or head for the plains and group up.
Your best bet is to hit the plains and group up with some Calf Killers. Good EXP and loot.
 Do this until level 11, keep saving cash because you are going to want to buy a Morning Star pretty soon, and those go for about 18 platinum! Once you get to level 11, find some friends who want to go to Splitpaw in South Karana.
You will need to get about 4 people together to really have a good chance of getting any of the magic armor the Nobels, Captians, and Commanders wear.
An example would be a Snakeskin Jerkin (tunic) AC 9 and +5 against poison. Also Snakeskin Gloves AC 3 +3 to Agility. In addition the Shamans carry Wood Totem that add +5 to Mana, or sell for 15 gold in Halas.
 Not only is this good armor, but it sells GREAT back in Halas to the guy behind the counter at the bank. Sell him any Cracked Staff or Bronze Weapons you might get as well. He pays top dollar!

 This ends part one of my cheesey guide. Below are a few more tips you might find usefull.

* Look for people selling Cut Throat Rings, they add a little to AGI, but don't pay over 8 gold a piece for them!

* Spiked Collars add +3 to STR, Studded +1 to STR and STA. About 1 Platinum is a good price.
