<!--<tr><td><font face="verdana">First of all I want to address the person who said dwarfs don't have infravision. Dwarfs DO HAVE INFRAVISION, they don't have ultravision which is what dark elfs have. I have a 37lvl dwarf warrior. I like the dwarf because he is only KOS in evil cities which makes him much more fun to play. A dwarf warrior starts with great str, sta, and dex. Dex is important because it increases the amount of times a proc will go off on your weapon and crit hits. I have a 145dex right now and I proc all the time. I also have a agility of 116 which I'm sure you will never see a troll, ogre, barb with stats like these. I do agree that str is important but there are so many str items out there that you really don't need to worry much about putting a lot of points into it. At 37lvl I have a little over 1300hps and a ac of 735. This ac total is with all my armor on and would be 700 with my stat boosting items on. I love the dwarf class because you don't see very many high lvl dwarfs around in dungeons and we all address each other as brother when we meet. There is no bond relationship like this between any other races. Us dwarfs remember each other and we stick together. People really get a good laugh when they see a group of dwarfs in a high lvl dungeon camping a room, just because we are so rare. I love the way my dwarf looks and we don't get in the way of caster line of sight when we melee a mob. We are small and that helps a lot in dungeons when there is very little space to move around. My dwarf warrior has a str of 142 which is well beyond enough to do the job well. If you want a warrior with all around good stats and no weakness pick the dwarf class. We have a lot of fun and we aren't KOS every where.</font></td></tr>-->
