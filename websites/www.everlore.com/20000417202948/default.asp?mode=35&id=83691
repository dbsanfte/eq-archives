				Ok last night I was brainstorming with a level 50 Paladin on the Veshaan Server.  We came up with a few good ideas of how to start it. One the Leader of Kaladim, he has been to quite for me to think no quest would go thought him plus wouldn't a leader of a town know all thats going on there. Second were the Paladins in Lake Rathe. i am just saying the main ones we came up with and the last one we thought of ,well i did right after we left, were the Paladins in Felwithe or the Drunkard in kelethin. Hope this helps but remember this is Brainstorming.

				Ok, everyone--the latest rumor is that the quest starts<BR>
with the Sphinxes in Rathe Mountains.  It is neceassary <BR>
to have high faction in order to get the good sphinx<BR>
to talk to you.  There is no confirmation on this, but <BR>
in a way it would make sense.  According to Gordon from<BR>
Verant, the Fiery Avenger Quest had been in the game <BR>
since its release but was apparently broken, then disabled <BR>
for the past three months, and now is active again.  The<BR>
sphinxes have been sitting there all along and no one <BR>
knew what their purpose was.  Now the question is how do<BR>
you improve faction with the Sphinx in order to get him<BR>
to talk to you?

				I HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH OF THIS IS TRUE, BUT I JUST PULLED THIS FROM ANOTHER BOARD.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You will require extraordinary faction with the paladins of North Freeport, and with the paladins in Erudin. When considering an individual of either faction, &quot;judges you amiably&quot; will not suffice. You need to be one step above this, &quot;smiles/considers you kindly/warmly&quot;.   In order to raise faction with the paladins of Erudin, you can acquire a quest to gather zombie skins. Slay zombie sailors in Erud's Crossing, harvest 4 flesh and return them for faction. <BR>
<BR>
Part 1: <BR>
<BR>
There is a high elf paladin in the Felwithe Paladin guild, in the basement that will reward you for completing the quest of returning Dvinn's Black Heart to him. There is a hidden quest here that he will not reveal to you unless you take the initiative. Slay Lord Grimrot in South Karana to earn &quot;Lord Grimrot's Misshapen Heart&quot;. Trade this to the paladin and with appropriate faction, he will reveal to you that a former knight one quested after a &quot;sword that purifies evil with fire&quot;. Take the note he gives to you and seek out the Drunk, a high elf, former knight it seems, wandering in Greater Faydark. Give him the note, which he reads, but decides not to give his information freely. The Drunk hands you a bottle, a two container slot, and requests an unusual drink before he &quot;spills his secrets&quot;.  The first of two drinks is the &quot;Tagglefoot Tingle Drink&quot;. This item is sometimes awarded by returning Runnyeye Warbeads to Rivervale in a side quest.  The second drink is created through Brewing. Find a craftsman to brew an Ogre Swill. The ingredients for this mix are a malt, yeast, froglock meat, and a cask. Combine the two drinks in the bottle, and return this to the Drunk. <BR>
<BR>
Part 2: <BR>
<BR>
The drunkard is impressed by the drink and unravels his tale. Apparently he once sought a &quot;sword of fire&quot;, but inevitably gave up. He hands you an &quot;Obsidian Key&quot;, and when you check your inventory, there is also a &quot;Key Ring&quot; present. He mentions that there are three keys he was after, but does not explain further, nor what the purpose of the keys is for. <BR>
<BR>
The second key is the &quot;Shiny Brass Key&quot;. This item is found off the Ghoul Magi in Unrest. <BR>
<BR>
The third key is a bit more elusive. In the Abbey of the Muse in Ak'anon, city of gnomes, you will find the cleric AND rogue guilds. The rogue guild is behind an illusionary wall, and behind an additional hidden wall within this complex is a gnome rogue, a master locksmith. Hailing him he talks about a &quot;skeleton key&quot; that is rumored to open many kinds of locks. When you ask him about the key, he hints that a rogue carried this key, but drowned long ago with a sinking ship.  Venture to the Ocean of Tears. Directly north of the small island with the dinosaur, and slightly to the left (near the isle of aviaks), dive deep under the water and near the bottom is an alcove with a zombie sailor type.  Killing him you find find the key on his body, which is actually called the &quot;Mythral Key&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Combine the three keys in the &quot;Key Ring&quot;, a 3 slot container, and create the &quot;Key Set&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Part 3: <BR>
<BR>
Venture to Erudin, to a chamber in one of the zones that constitutes the city. It is a long hallway with doors on both sides, one set of which leads to the bank. On the wall opposite the side with the &quot;Bank of Erudin&quot;, enter the chamber and locate the illusionary wall.  What is surprising about this setup is that the lower half of the wall is an illusion and fake, but the upper half is real! If you simply walk into the wall you not be able to pass, but your feet will stick through the base of the wall. In order to pass through this obstacle, you must be of gnome size and crouch low, or as of a recent patch, have a Shaman cast the spell &quot;Shrink&quot; on you. When you pass through the wall, you will come to a lobby room of sorts, a cubical with a door before you. Hold the &quot;Key Set&quot; with the mouse cursor and click on the door. The door will unlock and allow you to enter.  Inside is a study room of sorts, but also a living space and inside a human paladin in chain armor (not plate like the guild knights in Freeport and Qeynos). <BR>
<BR>
Hail the man and he mentions two things. He asks for his keys to the chamber that he lost (ignore this for now), or you can ask him who he is.  Apparently he is a former knight, seeking sanction in Erudin from the oppresive world. He is a bit curious/suspicious of your presence and requests/demands that you prove your worth.  He hands you a small bag, with four container slots. The knight says that the &quot;spawn of the burning prince&quot; must be stopped, and his skin brought back as proof of his demise. The Burning Prince is the name of Solusek Ro, god of fire, and the spawn is none other than Lord Nagafen.  You are required to obtain not one, but three red dragon scales off the wyrm. &quot;Red Dragon Scales&quot; is a moderately uncommon treasure item on the beast. Zero to as many as three (rarely) can be found on any one of his corpses. You will most likely have to slay the dragon three of four times to acquire an adequate supply.  The fourth item to be placed in the bag is a hammer. The reclusive paladin mentions a magic hammer to forge a blade like none other. The hammer he speaks of is the &quot;Thex Mallet&quot;, which is involved or referred to in at least two other quests, or can be used as a weapon after obtaining it.  To acquire the Mallet, slay the Elf Skeleton behind the third locked door in Befallen. He drops either the &quot;Head&quot; or &quot;Hilt&quot;, so kill the undead several times to get both pieces.  Also on the third floor is Commander Windstream, a level 20 or so zombie. He carries the &quot;stem&quot;, a two slot container in which you place both mallet pieces. Combine and create the hammer.  Place the dragon scales and mallet into the bag and return to Erudin to the hermit. <BR>
<BR>
Part 4: <BR>
<BR>
Hand the combined quest items to the knight. When you hail the knight now, he does mention &quot;returning his keys&quot;, or &quot;proving your worth&quot;. Instead he presents a different option.  He mentions &quot;supplies&quot;. Upon questioning his further, he hands you a piece of paper, a &quot;list&quot; of sorts, with various blacksmithing components noted, such as sheet of metal, ore, etc. Keep the list and gather the blacksmithing craft items. You will need to find a blacksmith to forge you some pieces. It is important to hail him along two different quest lines, in order to obtain both the list, and the backpack to combine all the smithing supplies.  (Similar to the Ice Comet quest in which you get both a book and the wheel container, but separately).  Return the backpack to the knight and he will tell you to return at sunrise, in one day's time. At this point he poofs. <BR>

Note: The knight will return to the room at 6am. Use the /time command to keep track. However it is important to realize that twenty four hours must have also passed in order for the room to be occupied once again.  Example: If you returned the blacksmithing backpack to him at 11pm, he will not be there at 6am because only seven hours passed, so an extra day must pass. However if you return the supplies to him at 5am, you will only have to wait 25 hours. <BR>

Part 5: <BR>
<BR>
The following morning, the knight will be back in the room, available for passers-by to initiate the quest. Hailing him he requests the return of his keys, or proving your worth, just as before. This time return the keys which you should have kept up until now. He thanks you, and on the side, asks if you have seen his list. You should still have the list of supplies as well. By giving him the list, you open up the next part of the quest.  He says that while you were gone, he had the Deepwater Knights forge a sword in reward for your heroism and courage, using the supplies and magical properties of the dragon scales. That is no doubt where the need for the mallet came into play. In any case, you are awarded a &quot;Forged Deepwater Blade&quot;.  [Forged Deepwater Blade Dmg: 18 Dly: 40 Class: Paladin]  Venture to North Freeport, where the Paladin Guild of the Marr twins can be found. Find the guild master of the guild, the one that a level 1 paladin human would present his guild note to. Hailing him will not present any recognition of the journey you have completed so far.   At this point, you must have the &quot;Soulfire&quot;. This holy sword is a prequisite for the last and final phase of this quest. In the trade window with the paladin knight, place both the Soulfire AND the Forged Deepwater Blade. If one OR the other is placed in the window alone, he will simply say &quot;thank you&quot;, and your sword will vanish. Killing the knight will not get the sword(s) back from his corpse.  You gain experience upon delivering both swords. Your additional reward is a scroll, as the knight speaks of a &quot;flaming sword&quot; to champion justice.  The &quot;Forged Deepwater Blade&quot; will be found in your inventory once again (placed their automatically), but the &quot;Soulfire&quot; is sacrificed at this stage.  Take the blade and the scroll and consult the leader of the Cleric guild in North Freeport, the temple of Marr. Hand the sealed scroll (you cannot read its contents) to the guild master, who casts some form of blessing/spell upon you. No effect will be readily noticeable, but upon searching your inventory:  The &quot;Forged Deepwater Blade&quot; of the Deepwater Knights of Erudin is replaced/transformed into a/the Fiery Avenger. <BR>
<BR>
Fiery Avenger <BR>
Dmg: 33 <BR>
Dly: 33 <BR>
Effect: Combust (182 dmg proc) <BR>
Class: Paladin <BR>
<BR>
This sword is not an artifact, but the quest is long and involved, demanding the pursuit of not just the deepwater blade, but the Soulfire as well. <BR>

				First of all, that huge quest above is a fake.  It's in other posts here and was out a while before they put it back in, so do not, I repeat DO NOT give up your Soulfire trying it.  Second, I bet it'll be a long time before anyone gets anywhere in this quest. Remember, Soulfire takes like 35 levels, literally, so, this bieng *the* holy sword to have, it should take longer.  However, to contradict myself, Verant probably made it easier than it should be to satisfy customer demand.  As for Equestrielle, who drops the hilt, that cuts down the Paladin's very image.  There's got to be another way to get it that doesn't involve killing it<BR>

				I was in the Ocean of Tears the other day and some of the level 50s in the zone were shouting about which NPC they need to kill for the &quot;Fiery Tome&quot; or something along the lines of that.  The reply I heard was Bob on the Brotherhood island.  Maybe this isn't true, but might be worth it to give it a try.
