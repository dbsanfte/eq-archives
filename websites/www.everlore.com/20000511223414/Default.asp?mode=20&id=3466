			<font face="verdana" size="2" color="black">*At the time of this story i was a level 5 Erudite Wizard.*<BR>
<BR>
The group had just gotten on the boat from erudin to Queynos. In the group was: Radicin, a level 8 Barbarian monk. Nevinyrral, a level 5 Erudite Wizard. Shadowheart, a level 7 Human warrior. And Imzadi, a level 8 Barbarian female. The dock floated back to shore and the boat began to gain speed as the winds of Norrath pushed it's mighty sails. The waves began to pound on the weathered hull as we picked up speed. I began to feel sick. I threw up over the side several times while Radicin laughed at my weakness of stomach. After what seemed like an eternity, we heard a distant cry &quot;BOAT!&quot;. That coud only mean one thing, we had arrived at South Queynos. The city dock came into view. Several people waiting for the boat and a few fishing. As we got off i kissed the ground. The city smelled of rotting fish and animal carcasses. We passed through the market area. Hundreds of people selling and buying items from all over the world of Norrath. We decided to stop and bought 15 fish and 20 bottles of milk each. The owner of the store was a crook but we didn't care, we were going on the biggest journey of our lives. As we exited the city gate, we bid farewell to the guards and stepped out into the Queynos Hills. We followed the path up untill a directional stone. People were hunting animals all around us. Carcasses littered the ground. Not just animal carcasses, human carcasses which had taken a larger enemy then they had bargained for. The rock said, Blackburrow forward.... Freeport Right! We went right on the road. We began talking about stories of our most prized kills. It was around 6 P.M. and it was getting dark. I gave Radicin a torch and summoned a sphere of light for myself. Suddenly we heard a growl comming from the side. A wolf jumped out of nowhere and bit radicin. Nevinyrral rushed and stabbed the wolf several times while Radicin kicked it. The wolf tried to run away, badly bleeding and bruised, barely able to walk. But i had no pity for it as it had bitten one of my freinds. My fists began to glow with fire and, the wolf was no more as its body burst into flames. Nevinyrral was already bandaging the barbarian. We began to slowly walk again, helping Radicin with every step. We saw a tavern ahead of us and decided to have a drink. It was full of music and laughter. We each had a few beers and got drunk. We all fell to the floor aspleep. I woke up first in the morning. I awakened the others. Ughh... we all felt terrible as the hangovers we were having ripped food from our stomachs. After an hour of vomiting, we stepped outside into the morning sunlight. We thanked the bartender and were back on our way. We began to sing songs and tell jokes while we walked several miles. Then as to ruin this day, it began to rain. We looked for shelter but couldn't find any. So we just continued ahead. After 3 hours straight of rain, it finally ceased and the land was yet again blessed by the rays of sunshine. We began to sing and laugh again for several miles. We saw strange sights. Beetles with pinchers that could slice a grown man in two. Spiders that were bigger than a cottage. We steered away from these monstrosities as conflict would have surely meant our demise. On the way we met a wonderfull gentleman that made us feel like we had spirits of wolves. Suddenly we were running so fast that the country scenary wizzed by in a colorfull blur. We were runnng so fast that we didnt  notice Nevinyrral trip. Untill we heard a horrible scream behind us. We stopped and turned around just in time to see two bandits stab and kill the poor Wizard. I shouted &quot;No!!&quot; and began to cast a spell. But they bandits were all ready laughing and running away. We went back to our freind's corpse and watched it as it slowly decomposed into the dirt of Norrath. We slowly continued forward, trying not to think about the death of Nevinyrral. We spotted a grizzly bear in front of us. Just as were were backing away, it saw us too. It began to run to us and slashed Radicin with its mighty claws. The three were fighting the bear as i froze its skin, then light it on fire. The bear quicly died in the flames and multiple stab wounds. The three were badly hurt. And suddenly a wolf attacked us. I used the last of my mana to burn it to the ground but not before it bit me twice in the leg and arm. We slowly began to walk, bleeding and bruised. We turned a corner and saw our fate. Staring down at us from 50 feet away with an evil grin, was a Giant of the hills, next to its side was a huge blood-thirsty lion. The two began to run towards us. I tried to root the to the ground but it had failed. The three tried to meelee the foes but Radicin and ShadowHeart were crushed by the giant in one hit while Imzadi was torn to pieces by the lion. I then did what all brave souls have down face to this opposition. I ran like hell. The lion was busy eating the remains of Imzadi while the giant didn't seem to see me. I ran far eough i thought and began to cast the spell of the gate. But the lion had seen me and right as i was about to finish my spell, the lion arrived to me. I stopped my spell. And i burned its skin. That made the creature furious and the last thing i remember is the thought of Nevinyrral and my allies as the lion slashed open my throught.
