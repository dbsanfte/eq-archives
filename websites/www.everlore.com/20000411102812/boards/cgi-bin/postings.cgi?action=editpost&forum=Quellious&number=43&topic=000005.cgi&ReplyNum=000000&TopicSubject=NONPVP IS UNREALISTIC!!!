<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">A Dark Elf Necromancer and Shadowknight team up with a Human Paladin and Cleric? WTF? I don't make a habit of searching for serial killers to become drinking buddies with, so why would my character? Likewise I don't go down the street to the nearest Crack dealer and talk smack to him, knowing that he has no ability to kill me... so why should my character? And I don't run around downtown Chicago asking how to get to Blackburrow, so why would my character talk about Chicago? (This last question pertains to ALL EQ servers)
   FIRST of all I'm not a lowbie slaying PK! Nor have I ever been. I don't profit off of looting the corpses of my player victims. I have even on two occasions been victim to player attacks. But I don't moan about it! I revel in it! WHAT A CHALLENGE! While most people spend there time hunting down NPC'c and creatures gaining experience for the purpose of going up against tougher NPC's and creatures, I'm doing the same thing but with a twist of the unpredictable... potential player opponents! 
   Now I am personally pro team pvp. I love it!! Unlike Rallos Zek there is structure. Your not looking behind your back every 5 seconds worrying about an attack from a fellow player. In team pvp you can can play it safe by sticking to your home area (except Freeport) or you can travel into other zones searching/causing trouble. As a Barbarian you will rarely see other teams and can therefore achieve L20+ without the fear of player attack.
  The Team server also add realism because the players have an incentive to roleplay. Built in to these servers is how each society views the other races, which provides roleplay opportunities. Many players refused to help my dwarf character. And pretty much every team is against the the Evil teams. I have played UO, as well and never found a server that consistently roleplayed. But Tallon and Vallon Zek are predominantly roleplay servers.
   EQ has 3 out of 25 servers pvp. Why? I think many people had heard stories of Ultima Online and feared getting PK'd. So when EQ shipped they had 1 out of 10 (i think) severs pvp. This drew the KILL KILL KILL crowd to that server. And it seemed that pvp meant Kill everything that moved! I played for 1 day and was immediately turned off by getting killed 5x in an hour. I never returned and played on a couple of nonpvp servers only to become bored and stopped all together. I started back up when the team pvp server came up and have been hooked since. IF YOU HAVE NOT YET TRIED THE TEAM SERVERS I HIGHLY RECCOMMEND THEM. You will find a true sense of community among your team mates. 
For those unwilling to try the Team servers I would be interested in hearing Why. My intent is to arouse interest in the Team servers so that others will be added. 
So why have you not tried Team Pvp? I would appreciate your responses. 
And If you have played I would appreciate your reactions too. 
            Sincerely,
              Luddha
