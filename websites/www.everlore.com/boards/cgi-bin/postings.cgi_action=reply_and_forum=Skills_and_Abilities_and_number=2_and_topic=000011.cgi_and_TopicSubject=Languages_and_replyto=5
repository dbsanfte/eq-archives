However, my skill level is not going up, and for the most part I can not understand, nor can I be understood by others.  Can someone assist me in how to raise my level in these different languages aside from just purchasing more slots?  Also, does anyone know how many levels you need in a language before you are fluent, or rather I should say excellent?</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Dumdum</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">when running with a friend, assuming you are troll and he is a ogre, have him make a hot key labeled teach or something. the command for that key would be /say hello how are you today. have him right click on the text area and change his lanuage setting from common to ogre. when you rest have him hit the teach key. I think at this point you need to change yours to ogre too. after a while you will see sentences instead of garbage.<P>I think this is the way it goes, someone correct me if im wrong.<P>Dumdum Troll SK (Veeshan)</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Jadow from Xegony</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Ok here's what you do. When you want to learn languages, wait for someone to /shout about teaching languages, or just /shout "Can anyone teach me a language?" and then someone might be willing to teach you Elvish or Erudian, or another lang, for a price or for free. What THEY then do is, spam you with the language enough times so your levels will raise enough for you to learn the language. Then when you speak it, others who know it will understand you.  The languages I currently know are: Barbarian, Erudian, Elvish, Troll, Gnomish, Thieves Cnt, Combine Tongue, Dragon, Elder Dragon, Gnollish, Dwarvish, Ogre, Tier Dal, Old Erudian, Halfling and Faerie. There are still more for me to collect, but it's not that hard. Anyway, have fun! Also, could someone please post a complete list of langs? That would be gr8!</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Iblazen</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">  Does anyone know why I would want to bother learning another lang?

Not a whole lot to do there. Form a group and each contribute a language they are excellent in. Hotkey a multi-line language spam and repeat over and over. By time boat docks, if not before, you will now be excellent in the new language(s). Outside of the research languages (Elder whatever) dark elf is useful, so when there are invasions you know what they shout!</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Askaria</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">I have a question.  I am a barbarian shaman, and just about every time I go to practice at the guild, there is a new language.  I alway practice at least once in the newer ones just so I can say I know 16 languages.  But they are not normal languages like elvish, ogre, etc... they are gnoll, orcish, lizardman, hill speak, faerie, froglok, etc... Should I use my practices in those?  Maybe be the first to talk to gnolls (well.. other than saying DIE YOU STUPID GNOLL).  <BR>I also wonder if they have gone so far as to make quests with these languages, like in BB or CB.  I never really know just how deep this game goes.  <BR>But back to the question... Should I pour in a bunch of practice to learn on of these languages?  I am lvl 21 so there is not much else to practice in, well.. other than Alchemy and specialization thingies.<P>Askaria Gunnarson   <IMG SRC="http://www.everlore.com/boards/EL/wink.gif"><BR>Karana Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">skai</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">When my friend spoke to me in Troll, I got a message that said that my language skills were improving, but I cannot speak troll, cannot learn it at guild, and it is not on my skill list.

I spoke to a GM about it and all he said was that there are a LOT more languages then i know about, but was not at the liberty to tell me about.
