[B]When I first got eq, I thought of the shaman as a crap class, and somethin that I wouldn't be interested in at all. I was thinkin "Tribal witch doctor, what a joke".  My first character originated from Freeport, and so I rarely ever saw any, and that just built up my ignorant idea.  The only thing I had heard that was good about them was their ability to SOW.  Then the new server came along, and I decided to try a shaman, so I could confirm my belief that they are crap...GOD DAMN WAS I WRONG!!!!.  I started a barbarian shaman, and it was the best thing i've done since buyin EQ.  To me, the shaman is a perfect class, and I'm completely happy with everything they have to offer.  I'm currently at lvl 16, so the greatness of being a shaman has only begun to shine, (I'm not old enough to be able to complain over the broken alchemy yet).

I just thought I'd like to share that with everyone.  Anyway, I feel that we as shaman don't really need to be changed in any way, I'm perfectly happy the way we are.  (Of course, I'm nearly as experienced as some of you EQ players that have been here for a while, so I may be missin some things).

This might be an instance in which verant hasn't bothered to change a class for a reason...cause we're badasses already (or at least I think so).

Not only are we the buff gods, by 14 level we can bind and sow as well as fight like warriors. I know that I can stand next to a druid friend of mine, dish out as much damage if not more, plus get off spirit strike three or four times. If I could add anything what would it be?

I wanna do this now.  *poof*  Downside - while it's a pain to have to walk 2 continents with all their requisite dangers (okay SoW reduces that somewhat), I can see people taking advantage of it.  Things like, need food?  Bind here, tele home, buy food, gate back.  Then again, wizards, etc.. can take advantage almost the same way.<P>2.  Inner fire - Great first level spell.  Still using it in fact at 18th level and prolly always will.  Let's see the exact same spell with some boost.  Inner Blaze, Soul Fire, Soul Blaze (or something to that effect).  Same thing, only more of it.<P>3.  Weapons - not too many out there.  In particular I'd like to see some cool piercing weapons for us.  There's only a handful we can use right now and as I recall getting our ability up to use them is a pain in and of itself.<P>4.  Pets - okay, the fact that we even get them is a good thing but I'd like to see something unique here for us.  Wolves?  I mean, I dunno, doesn't work for me all too well.  I'd love to see a different pet for each of the three shaman races like maybe a Polar bear for the Barbarians, a gator for the ogres and maybe a shadow wolf or something like for the trolls.  You get the idea, I'm sure.  <P>5. Aside from that, we're bloody near perfect.  I'm impressed with those who say they can continue to solo right up the line, I take on blue's and fear for my life on a fairly regular basis.  Maybe it's just my style.<P>Brus<BR>Shaman of Justice, 18th Circle<BR>Halas, Brell Serillis</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">fumeden</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">they need to patch the alchemy portion.  what a useless skill.  could they make it anymore useless?  how about lowering prices on herbs, maybe make them drop on mobs, and possibly throw some potions in that we can make that people would actually want.  Sow, bind, gate, whats wrong with those?  Who the hell wants to buy an invisibility potion that costs 400,000pp to make (i exaggerate) when you can pay someone (if you need to) 1or 2pp to cast it?  Other than that the shaman absolutely kicks ass.<P>Fumeden Ex<BR>27th season<BR>Solusek Ro<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Nadger</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">I agree we dont need to be messed with...it would be cool to see some new stuff for the shaman...but why fix it if it isnt broke?  I do agree alchemy is a joke...i have 50 practices saved up for when ever they decide to fix it.  1 of the coolest sounding potions is broken...potion of somber origens or somethign like that...it cures drunk...but lets you keep the stat boost.  Shamans...real shamans from tribes used spears...so i could see some room for some more pericing weapons...tribal shamans also wore differnt masks that supposivly had different effects...so maybe make some shaman only quests for masks like that.  I dont know, im just trying to compair eq shamans with real shamans.<BR>We will never get clarity, enchanters would bitch to much.  We HAD charm but enchanters bitched to much there so we lost it.  You can still buy the spell...but its level 62 or something so we cant even use it.<P>i only have 2 suggestions that are just common sense.<P>1) Our pets should allready have spirit of wolf on them when you summon them...i mean there a wolf...why do we need to give them spirit of wolf so they can keep up<P>2) Make spirit of wolf work indoors...i personally HATE dungens for that fact.  I mean weak non-shamans can get sow indoors with there gay lil jboots...seems like we shamans..the real spirit of wolf people should be able to cast it indoors...and jboots outdoors only.<P>but ill say it again...If it "aint" broke dont fix it.<P>Nadger Nagafen<BR>35 Troll Shaman<BR>Innorunk Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Grimhaed</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Don't get me wrong with my original post. I was just annoyed that all classes had some sort of adjustment or fix. Some even had gains, albeit small ones. Except for Shaman. Which had no gains, and no fixes. Alchemy being my biggest single complaint. What is the problem when rogues can get their precious poison proc and we can't get a working trade skill.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Thunndarr McDuff</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">I have to agree with many of the previous posts about Shamans being near perfect, but we really have some crappy weapons.  I am lvl 22 and can only hit for 30 with my Midnight Mallet.  Soloing is VERY tough, and MOBs that con high blue present quite a challenge at times.  I am envious of the SK that I group with that has double attack for about 44 a hit and casts like crazy, while I see "You try to crush a ****** but miss."  God forbid I am out of mana, cause that means big trouble, especially in dungeons where NPCs tend to train like mad.  Buffs are great, but whoever said we fight like warriors is just smokin' crack!</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Lengurena</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">We should be glad that Verant aren't tweaking our class.
