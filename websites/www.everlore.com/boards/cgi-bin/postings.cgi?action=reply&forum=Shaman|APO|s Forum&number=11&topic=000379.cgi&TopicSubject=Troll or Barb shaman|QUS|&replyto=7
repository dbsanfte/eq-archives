<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Myshra:
[B]I too have played both a troll and barb shaman, and both have their repsective advantages. But I prefer barbs for a couple of reasons.

First, the KOS factor. Yes, there are ways around it, but it annoyed me whenever I was running through a zone or city and some guy in a building or just walking (who I had neglected to fix my faction with) chased me out of the zone. It is just so much nicer not to have to think about it.

Secondly, making money. As a troll, most merchants dont like you. Trying to sell loot while hunting in CB or Everfrost can be a bother (gate home to Grobb? GAH!) Also, banking. Even if the guards like you, the bankers may not. 

Just keep these points in mind. If you can live with them, then a troll is great fun. Natural regen is great, as is troll lingo.

I was wondering what was better to start, a troll or barbarian. I like the way trolls look in all armor, but barbarians arent kos. But being KOS doesn't matter THAT much b/c we can make our own food and drink. So what do u guys think? thanx for the help. also any cool troll names would be greatly appricated, i think im gonna pick a troll. But i wanted to see what you all thought first. thanks godspeed<P>                     (??Name??)<BR>                   _______ Shaman Lvl O<P>                              =D</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Valantor</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">I hadda go with barb because nearly every NPC in the world hates ye if yer a troll/ogre. Sure they wont attack ye when yer forty fifth level and they are afraid of ye.... but they will NOT give ye cool quests, either.<P>Some monsters that are indifferent to me (aviaks) will attack a troll ogre on sight. ye wont find many trolls at aviak tree.<P>The roleplaying bonus of a man-eating shaman has its allure... the regen of the troll is nice... but if ye wanna play the game to its fullest ye should choose a barb so ye can go almost everywhere and not be afraid to hail that interesting NPC ye just saw.<P>Plus ye dont get invisiblity til 29th level...which bites if yer evil.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Bianca</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">I play a barbarian shaman, but i would have much rather played a troll shaman, just dont want to start over now. Im more into the roleplaying, i have a few troll characters, and nothing better than saying 'me no likey goody goody racey' when someone asks for a sow, or 'me barsh' is often fun to say.

Im lvl 23 and I absolutely LOVE IT.  Natural regenration's saved my butt a few times and helps me cut down seriously on my downtime.  There are ways around the whole KOS factor, it just requires a lot of work, or some ingenuity.  And the occasional long walk or two.  <BR>Once I hit 24 that means I get my regeneration spell.  On top of natural Troll regeneration, wich will now give me 16hp's a tick, and cannibalize I should be able to cut down on my downtime even more.  <BR>Sides which the roleplay aspect of a sparkling troll is just fun as hell.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Skyen</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Do you want the exp hit for being a troll? Barbarians can achieve the highest wisdom if they put all their points into this at creation. There are many a time when I wish my barbarian was a troll but equally as many I was glad I was barbarian. In the end it really doesnt matter when you are bashing frogs and the like, but one thing is for sure being a group orientated class barbarians will level faster.<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Bigdaddy</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">I run a troll Shaman and he's COOL!  I always wanted to be a shaman and I already have a Killer Barbarian Warrior, and I really don't like ogres.  So I made a troll, they seem to be good at casting and the KOS we get can be overlooked.

Currently, I play the troll. In fact, I deleted my lvl 13 barb shmn because the role play just isnt there. People love grouping w/ trolls, especially if they are roleplayed *well*. I dont mean talking trash to every wood elf you see, though giving the finger to a high lvl druid is always a hoot (in role, of course). Be sloppy, funny, dirty, crazy, gross and of course, always ready to BASH! As far as being KoS, yes, it is difficult. But think of it this way, if you are KoS in 80% of Norrath, thats just that much more you get to BARSH!! when you are an ass-kicker. Troll or Ogre? If I had to do it again, I would probably play an ogre. The same oportunity for great roleplay is still there and the wis and str are higher, making for a stronger shmn in the early stages. However, you *must* think long term as there are many items that will up your stats to even the race field. I played troll simply because the troll helms are about the most wicked in the game. Superfical? Oh well. Another word of advice, play your shammy to lvl 24 at least. You wont get all you can out of the class untill then! <P>This has been my 2 shinnies.<P>Sinnur Z'Lytpheets <BR>24th shaman <BR>Cult of the Blood Moon<BR>Tribunal<BR>"Death tu da hummyz!
