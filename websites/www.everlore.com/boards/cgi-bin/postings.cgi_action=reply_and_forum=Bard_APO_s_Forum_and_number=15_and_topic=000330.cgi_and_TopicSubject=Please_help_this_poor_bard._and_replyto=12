Starts with the lousy songs that are useless, and there is no place where they are applicable and usefull at all. I am 17 and just about died at hands of a raider that used some serious magic direct damage that I could not undo and for which ALL the songs we have are massively useless. I ended up running to the zone (stone bridge this happened at -- and I have good faction with the bandits due to all the gnolls and orcs stuff in Highpass for two full levels) before she was able to finish me off, and I had less that a half bubble left. <P>This is Verant's version of fairness. She con'd green to me, btw.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Moshkiae</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">(Sorry, didn't finish the post).<P>Eventually I ended up in the Oasis of Marr in a various groups. Fast level and a half, with only two deaths. Then decided that was enough, as Verant decided to let out the nasties twice as much now, and those dark devils are nasty, and not enough high level players are camping them ... like the Giants, they tend to clean house. When that happened, I called it quits in Oasis for good. Have been in Highpass ever since, and it has been highly profitable and nice, with the exception of one boner death that shouldn't have happened -- I panicked. I'll probably stay here for two more levels and then graduate into the dungeons some in groups, I imagine, since I do not relish the idea of going three or four zones looking for my body.<P>Moshkiae of the 17th song in Veeshan</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Bard Valmi (Tunare)</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">If you're coming from the Feydark area, I have some suggestions. I leveled from 11-15 off the Drake-Mino area in Steamfront, and the Orc camps in LFey. Tough to find blues in Feydark past about 14 though, so I suggest the Derv camps in Ro. At 18th, I still got exp off some of them. When you can find a good group, Oasis will really rock. You'll know very quickly if it's a good group by whether or not you're picking up your corpse. Watch out for the occasional Spectre train and wandering Sand Giant. Another great area is East Karana. If you bind in Rivervale or HighPass, you can hunt Carrion Spiders, Reavers, etc in EK. You can also go to Beholder's Maze and group hunt Minotaurs there atabout 15th. I used the zone level chart on Allakhazam's to pick out places to hunt. It's a great resource, and having travelled and tried many places; I can usually find good hunting no matter how crowded the server is.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Radink</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">I would have to definatly agree with Oasis.

You probably would get better experience going overseas to Oasis, but if you want to stay "close to home", bound in a zone that is close to everywhere you want to fight (short corpse runs!), you might try staying on Faydwer.<P>I started in Unrest at 14th level, and you could probably do well in there if you have a magic weapon and well-balanced group.  Death Beetles, Greater Skeletons, Tormented Dead, and Jack O'Lanterns are great so long as you stay against the wall and away from the house.  Bards are particularly appreciated in Unrest for their Restoration song, because that lets a Cleric meditate after battles to do damage against nasty undead things, rather than blowing their mana to top everyone's health off.  And Selo's Accelerando provides a quick escape for your party to the zone if a train is pulled over you.<P>Lilithiel Skye<BR>Songweaver on Karana<BR>Weeny Wood Elf Bard with 24 2/5 Songs<BR>The Bloodthirsty Blueberry Bardgirl<BR>lilithiel@norrath.zzn.com</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Eliandel</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Regarding fighting a green bandit and losing, don't worry yourself too much about it.  All magic users in the game are seriously under-conned since they have limitless mana and cast almost constantly with little chance of being interrupted compared to players, and tend to be able to deal out a great deal more damage over time than a melee type mob 5 levels below them.<P>It didn't beat you because you're a Bard.  Trust me.  Even Warriors get slaughtered by casters constantly.  The only thing that sets melee classes apart vs. green casters is bash/slam.  At level 20 (I'm a Bard) I still dread those packs of bandit casters.  You'd have to be one tough cookie to take on 4 of em, with half of em invoking lightning and the other half casting damage shields, ignite, and whatever wind spell they get at level 9.  Just thank God they don't cast DoTs.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Moshkiae</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">>>> I was reluctant (still am) to leave the continent of Faydwer for experirence. <<<<P>The game pretty much forces you to move around anyway, so the choices you make will eventually have to take you out of "home". The only thing you want to remember is to make sure and get a Bind everywhere that you can ... so your trip is not even longer and harried than one would desire.<P>>>>You probably would get better experience going overseas to Oasis, but if you want to stay "close to home", bound in a zone that is close to everywhere you want to fight (short corpse runs!), you might try staying on Faydwer.<<<<P>It's the fact of life. Expect two or three deaths per level. No matter how carefull, or hard I try to beat this, I have not been able to. Basically the only factor that matters is the quality and discipline of the groups that you enter into. If the quality and work is good, sacrifice and stay as long as possible, because the better groups help things move faster. The wild groups, where there is always someone that has hot feet and can't stand still and be patient, will usually level faster, but also die a lot more. If a warrior, I probably wouldn't mind. But as a Bard, or any caster, to have and reset all the spells and songs, and keys is a pain and a half.<BR> <BR>Moshkiae</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Atri</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">You really should travel and see the whole of Norrath. It is a rewarding experience.  The zones really do differ quite a bit and you can travel to many exotic places.  I usually try to donwload a map of the zone I want to hunt in first and that helps tremendously.  I spent alot of teen levels in east karana and hunted lions, then lion pats/mats, and then stalkers and hounds until I was almost level 20.  Highpass was great too for high teens and the keep is great for  levels 20-30.<BR>One final note.  If you are running across Norrath from Freeport to Qeynos and need to go through Kithicor woods make sure it is daytime and that you run along the zone border.  High level undead casters litter the zone at night and they will kill you dead (it happened to me more than once before I wised up).  Their spells have range and very high damage. 2-3 hits and its over.<BR>Most of the other zones can be run across with a drum without fear due to our speed.  Nothing was able to catch me from mid teens on if I had my drum and few things even without it.  Just be sure to warn people if you are training the zone, they hate it when you don't  <IMG SRC="http://www.everlore.com/boards/EL/smile.gif"><P>------------------<BR>Atri Drumrunner<BR>Ashenwood Elite<BR>Bard of 24 songs<BR>Erollosi Marr</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">nXgSpeed</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">>It's the fact of life.

I have had zero problems soloing from level 1 on up to 21 where I've had to move into more dangerous areas that require a good group. I'm always twisting the 3 songs that best fit the situation and i've never had to run from a low blue, although some high blues and evens got lucky and I had to kite them with bellow so I still got the exp rather then zoning. I've finally slowed down at 20th but In 4 more levels I will have fear and charm and I will never die unless I go into dungeons where I cant use selo's. All in all im very happy with my class   <IMG SRC="http://www.everlore.com/boards/EL/smile.gif"><p>[This message has been edited by nXgSpeed (edited 02-10-2000).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Atri</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">I don't die 3 times a level either.  If I die once in a level it is a bad level for me.  I have gone several levels without dying at all.  I find it is much easier to die in a group than solo.  I have not been killed by a blue con since my mid teens unless something else joined it against me (with the possible exception of Crag Spiders and their poison, and I was still able to get away before death).<BR>Groups can often get you killed due to cowboys and scrubs.  If you are in a dangerous area and they aren't good players, your group becomes a liability instead of an asset.  The only problem is that the best places to get exp and loot are the dangerous ones.

Make sure it's <b>BROAD DAYLIGHT</b> before you zone into Kithicor from either side.<P>A week or so ago I was leaving Highpass for Kithicor.  It was about 7 am game time; I was but a few Selo'd steps from the rocky pass that leads from Highpass, on the path, and then suddenly: "LOADING... PLEASE WAIT".  I scrolled up and discovered I'd been harm-touched by a Rotting Knight for 550 points of damage and then kicked for 12 points of damage. I pretty much died before I hit the ground.<P>Lesson learned: don't make the run through Kithicor at 23rd level before 10:00 am.<P>Moshkiae wrote in support of leaving Faydwer for zones distant, "<em>The only thing you want to remember is to make sure and get a Bind everywhere that you can ... so your trip is not even longer and harried than one would desire.</em>"<P>This is good advice; however, there are many instances where a travelling bard just <b> can't</b> get a bind, no matter how much plat is offered... this is one of the reasons I prefer to stay on Faydwer.<P>Highpass is nice for a 14-15 level bard, if you can get a good solid group to work with you every night.  At least on the Karana server, the Highpass orcs and gnolls are thoroughly camped, and only nukers are sought for groups.  Bards need not apply.  <IMG SRC="http://www.everlore.com/boards/EL/frown.gif"><P>Moshkiae also wrote, "<em>It's the fact of life. Expect two or three deaths per level.

Already had mine at 17 in the Kithicor Woods, courtesy of bad lag and zoning from Highpass. When I came up I was facing the Rivervale entrance. Turned around, started Seed, took three paces and ... LOADING, PLEASE WAIT ... a Rotting Knight had gotten me in one swell foop. It was 9AM in the game. This is the 2nd time I have been ding'd in Kithicor. I have petitioned a recoup in this loss of XP, and got the usual no reply from anyone. There is no way that one should zone and find themselves a fifth of the zone away from the zone cross area. Massive bug -- what else is new?<P>But if there is a frustration in my abilities is that I have a real hard time leveling. Groups, not so bad, and getting easier. But singles, is a foregone conclusion. I guess I don't have the compassion and patience to Bellow a Griffawn to death, and see if it takes 40 or 62 minutes to do it.<P>I can count five deaths in my gaming that should be considered "boners" as these games are way too new for me.  I can count 9 deaths on account of lag and crashes. I have upgraded things to an Intel Network card, which has improved things, but it did not help stop the last death in Kithicor, which I believe it to be a server side problem and fault, and not something I should be punished for. That leaves 15 deaths left in my 17 levels, or about one per level, three of those in Crushbone, because of bad groups that refused to use discipline, two of which I quit, but not before I died.<P>Aside from that, a Hill Giant, a Deepwater Caymen, a named Orc in Oasis, a Goblin Wizard in Butcherblock, an Aqua Goblin Shaman at the Kaladim Docks, one what's her name that protects the wolves in the Qeynos Hills, twice by Orcs in Highpass due to lack of knowledge of the area, ... nothing major, but a part of the learning how to play the game.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Atri</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Kith has become the most hated of zones for me.
