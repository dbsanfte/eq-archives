<!--<tr><td><font face="verdana">  I don't see much for Clerical guides, so I figured I'd give some advice based on what i know.

  I play a Dwarven Cleric, currently lvl 12.. But this guide should be alright for anyone that has access to the Freeport areas.

  I'm not going to tell you what to put your skill points in like most other guides do.  I figure this is your decision for your character.  But I will say don't bother saving your skill points up for when you get Meditate.. Pump 1 or 2 points into it to get started, and after that it will go up really fast on its own from being used so much.

  Starting out from roughly lvls 1-5, I suggest just sticking locally around your hometown and killing things like bats, snakes, spiderlings, fire beetles, decaying skeletons, etc.. Try to save some money for when you reach later levels, because your spells wind up getting pretty expensive.  Every dime counts with a Cleric.

  After I hit level 6, I immediately hopped on the boat over to Freeport and got myself bound there.  I haven't left yet, and I'm level 12.  Clerics around these levels will ALWAYS be able to find a group, so do just that. Find some people around your level in the commons, and go out killin' some giant scarabs, giant spiders, pumas, etc.. As long as your group is smart and well-rounded, you should have no problems getting up to about lvl 10 around here.  After that, group up some more and take out the orc camps (centurions and oracles). Also try the Desert of Ro, where you can find more scarabs, tarantulas, and maybe even try the occasional madman.

  Right now at level 12, I am spending most of my time grouping in the West Commons, fighting wisps, kodiaks, and more orcs.  Sometimes I go to Ro and take out some dervs for a nice change.  

  If you plan on soloing, do it against undead.  Root them down and blast away with Ward Undead.  Do this with caution tho, because 2 or 3 zombies or mummies on you can be a very very bad thing. Even tho Clerics are masters of taking the undead, it's still much more rewarding and much safer to get yourself in a group. You'll be much more efficient there.

  Anyway, I can't stress enough about saving money.  We Clerics have it tough. Splitting your money between better equipment and new spells is difficult.  I suggest saving for the spells. I've been using the same patchwork armor for a while, and I've been alright. =)


  Anyone else that feels they could continue on from lvls 12-14+, feel free. I will be back after I advance a bit more to add on to this.
