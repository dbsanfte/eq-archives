<!--<tr><td><font face="verdana">On my opinion, this is the absolute best warrior race there is.  Not only are u strong, agile, and have a lot of stamina but u heal TWICE AS FAST as any other race!!! Well as far as stats go, i put 2 into strength, 7 into agility, and 16 into stamina altho i wish i put more into strength now.  I'm not going to go through where ur guild is and to equip ur tiny sword blah blah blah. Just when ur done with it go outside and prepare to fight.

Levels 1-3
These are incredibly boring and easy levels, i finsihed within an hour.  Just kill Froglok Tadpoles, Skellies, Rats, and the ocasional snake.  At level 2 you can kill all of the above plus some lesser kobolds. Kill a lot of these cuz they drop bags sometimes which u will need a lot of.  Save EVERY Froglok Tadpole flesh u get! This is a great way to make money in the near future so put every one in the bank. Save all ur money from these levels until you can buy a Rusty 2-Handed Sword from a merchant, they run about 4 gold each. That brings us to level 4.

Levels 4-7 At level 3 i was lucky and found a group of level 4 and 5's to kill frogloks in. Get a group like that and let them lead you to the best hunting zone for ur level range in the entire world as far as i kno, and i have started every single race there is.  Here kill in the group until level 4 then disband and solo.  Solo any blue conning or white conning frogloks you see and you will get to level 5 VERY quickly. Now by now you should have a lot of froglok meat, if i didn't mention to save those i am now, go to ur guild leader with all those peices of flesh and meat and give him groups of 2 flesh and 1 meat, for every 2 flesh and 1 meat you get a 2handed battle axe that sells for 2 gold 1 silver each at the merchant! Those along with weapons and netted armor made me about 4 plat every visit to froglok land! Now buy leather with all that money until you have a full suit then start saving that money in the bank for banded. Continue fighting like this killing anything that cons blue or green over in froglok hunting land and when i get past 7 i will tell u what i did!
