</FONT><HR>Well lets look at it at a variety of ways.<P>Mages:<BR>Pets: Pets are a very good thing. You can solo things with them, and you wont need to med as much if you didnt have them. They take a little exp, but this is irrelevant because you don't have to wait to gain your mana back. The sucky thing is that pets suck in dungeons and are not as effective as you get into the higher levels. (note the "not as", i'm not saying they are worthless, anyone that has sacrificed a pet to a sand giant knows they are VERY useful.)<P>Spells: The mage spell selection is good IMHO at all stages of advancement. However, people can say that wizards spells do more damage, I say so what. You can do the mana/damage conversions if you want to see the best ratios, and mages and wizards equal out. (somewhat)<BR>All in all pets make up for any spell damage loss.<P>Wizards:<BR>Spells: Since this is all they have the better damn well have the most damaging spells. I would seriously look at the commitment it takes to level a wizard. The are very slow to advance because you are constantly medding. Grouping is essensial with a wizard, not so with a mage. But, once you get higher in rank then, boy oh boy, you can just about solo anything. (ala Root n Shoot) This is why you always see a group of high level wizzes camping all the hotspots. Curse you spellflingers!<BR>And don't forget about teleport too. Go first class anywhere!<P>All in all it just depends if you want to group or not. Wizzies at high levels are a staple of any group, mages not so much. Mages can solo better than wizards at almost any stage of the game (in the right areas!)<P>So do you want it easy at the beginning and hard later (mage) or do you want it hard now and easy later (wizard)?<P>Me, i pick mage but thats me. =D<P>Ftini</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=7&topic=000059.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=Magician|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Magi+or+Wiz">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>I must agree with ftini. The best way to decide in my opinion is do you want to solo or team? If you go magician as I have soloing is a lot easier. I love my pets, sometimes they make for good, oh how shall I say it, sacrifices. Getting hit too hard let the pet take the brunt and rlh. (run like heck). I have yet to play a wiz, so I am kind of bias. But I would try for some thing that you can solo until you meet more players that you can get along with and work with. I've found some I can, and some I can't. If I could all 2 of my characters would worship bristlebane ,the god of practical jokes and humor.<BR> I hope this helped a bit though.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=7&topic=000059.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=Magician|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Magi+or+Wiz">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>Some of your points are valid. Others are not (IMHO). I don't think a wizard is a good solo player. Spells get resisted a lot, root doesn't last long (if it sticks at all) and you won't have enough mana to kill multiple mobs. And a wizard without mana is completely useless. <P>You are probably right about the fact that wizards are more useful in high level groups than magicians. At level 24 I know I can still be a valuable addition to a group. But I'm aware this will change when I'm forced to fight in a dungeon.<P>I group a lot with a druid of my level and he has *NOT* a much easier time soloing until now (he hates kiting). When fighting single mobs, I'm more powerful than he is.<BR>A druid can't beat a combination of a pet with fireshield + nukes (unless kiting).<P>At level 23 I can look a level 24 tidal lord in the eyes and kill him (ok. with a pet in front of me). That is real power!  <IMG SRC="http://www.everlore.com/boards/EL/smile.gif"><BR>Who cares about the fact that a druid can kite him?

</FONT><HR>Mage,<P>I do not know what your problem against magician is. I'm sorry you hate them so, however, state your points *for* a wizard, state your points *for* a mage. Then state the points against. The purpose of this particular post is to help someone decide for themselves which is a good class for him. Not the *BEST* class. There is no *best* class. As for /who all mage and /who all wiz, big deal. Not many people pick mages and that's not a bad thing. There are people that have found the magician class to be extremely fun to play, yes fun, it is a GAME after all. You can't make it your goal to discourage newbies from playing a mage, let them discover for themselves how bad or good a class is. Just tell them what you like about whatever class they are interested in and try to be as nuetral as you can. We could sit here all day battling back and for about which class solo's better, which one has the better spells, which levels faster, which is more powerful, and we will get nowhere. The point is this: A class is only as powerful and effective as the person controlling him.<P>Your friendly mage,<BR>Ftini</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=7&topic=000059.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=Magician|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Magi+or+Wiz">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>This is a post from someguy in "wizards suck" thread.<P><BR>                         A rather longer post than intended -- and one that I have not proof read...<P>                         The most popular comparison seems to be Wizard to Mage, and, I would agree, that these two are the most<BR>                         compatible for the types of comparisons that are being made.<P>                         I have played both classes past mid-level (Considering 25 to be mid-level). It seems that damage is what<BR>                         everyone wishes to compare. At every? level a wizard does SLIGHTLY more damage per cast, with SLIGHTLY less<BR>                         mana, for a SLIGHTLY faster casting / recycle time. The wizard also gets a much wider variety of types of<BR>                         damage, making the wizard more versitile, and forcing the mage to choose mobs much more selectivly. All of the<BR>                         wizards damage spells are Evocation (not so with the mage -- some are summoning), this makes specialization<BR>                         more valuable for the wizard. Wizards get gate spells -- giving them a Much wider selection of zones and mobs.<BR>                         And while the mage spends 30 to40 minutes running across zones, the wizard is able to spend that time finding a<BR>                         group/getting exp/or just realizing that there is not good opportunity in this zone and gating someplace else --<BR>                         oops, thats another 30 minutes for the mage.<P>                         The wizard gets the root line of spells -- and yes, the get resisted about 60% of the time, and a DD can knock a<BR>                         mob free early. But they are much better used to keep a mob out of combat, stop an early runner, allow a<BR>                         wounded player to retreat giving the healer a little extra time to get that heal off.<P>                         The wizard gets stun spells. resisted more than i would like, but very valuable if used properly -- I'm not going<BR>                         into this.<P>                         The wizard gets the Skin series of spells.<P>                         The mage gets summon spells. These are not especially valuable, except for summon bandages, and the summon<BR>                         (20) food and water. But really, ive found even as a mage I would just buy a backpack full of food, because<BR>                         summoning it was rather a bother and is by no means unique to the mage.<P>                         The mage gets a pet, and, quite a nice pet if used intelligently. This is most usefull when fighting single mobs, or<BR>                         even using the pet to buy you enough time to run/gate. On a solo-note, I am able to solo whites and<BR>                         occationally yellows with a Strong pet in my high 20s, by carefully keeping a mob balanced between attacking<BR>                         myself and the pet. This would result in myself ending the fight with about a bubble, the pet at 10%, and having<BR>                         expended all of my mana. You can usually tell if the fight is going to go badly, and gate out early, so it is fairly<BR>                         safe, if done properly -- but certainly not a good/fast way to gain any experience. And the pet can be valuable<BR>                         to certain group composition and/or fighting situations.<P>                         But, how often do you see pets in a dungeon? Almost never. At least not in Guk or Solusek, or Perma. Certain<BR>                         places in CT and Unrest, but not all.<P>                         Without the pet, the mage is a Slightly underpowered wizard, that can't stun/root/evac when needed.<P>                         I've found both classes a LOT of fun to play. I would try to solo Neither for exp, at least not past low level. Both<BR>                         can be very valuable to a group. MANY situations make the mages pet a great reason to choose the mage over<BR>                         the wizard. Especially in a smaller group fighting in the open. The wizard, though, is by far the more versitile, and<BR>                         more usefull in a full and/or well balanced group. And certainly more useful in most dungeons. But this always<BR>                         depends on playing the proper role for the group that you are in.<P>                         To end what has become longer than intended. A situation for comparison can easily be chosen, such that the<BR>                         mages pet can be fully utilized, and such that the mages DD is just as effective on the chosen mob as the<BR>                         wizard's DD at the chosen level, and such that ... etc etc. and in these certain instances (which are many) the<BR>                         mage will out perform the wizard. But dont be fooled by the perfect situation in an argument like this, it is<BR>                         dangerous. Ask a high level mage how many times he was in a situation where he was unable to use a pet, and<BR>                         was relegated to being an underpowered wizard. And how often he wanted to go to perma, when all he had was<BR>                         a cold-based spell, or solusek, armed with a fire-based spell. Or when he finally got a new DD and it relied on<BR>                         summoning and he has speciallized in evocation.<P>                         Just try to look at All that both classes are when making these types of comparisons, don't focus on one set of<BR>                         numbers or just what each class can solo, or just how they each perform in PK situations. -- again, though, i am<BR>                         sorry about the long length, and rambling nature of the post.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=7&topic=000059.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=Magician|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Magi+or+Wiz">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>This thread is to help NEW players decide which class is better magi or wiz.<P>I hope above post helps you in your decision.<P>The guy who wanted to duel me, sure anytime loser I'm 17th level magi. <BR>I'm glad so many of you are having FUN playin g a magi. Don't you guys have any complaints?<P>my complaint/whine<BR>1. summon item/weapon is worthless.<BR>2. we have no strategy /pet kill, nuke(shock,flame) <BR>3. Pets are USELESS in dungeons.<BR>4. No group useful spells.<P>my solution<BR>1. This class needs group useful spells, either buff/debuff or Teleport spells.<BR>2. Need root or lull series of spells since pets are not always useful and you are dead w/o pets.<BR>3. summon item/weapon need to be changed to make them useful, We get ring of flight at 39th level, WOW a levitation spell at 39th.<BR>Maybe if we could summon jboots or SOW boots <BR>now that would be useful.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=7&topic=000059.cgi&ReplyNum=000008&forum=Magician|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Magi+or+Wiz">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>Bravo - the above thread from an experienced mage / wizard is excellent and I agree on all points.  There are things I like and dislike about both mages and wizards.  I wish mages could teleport and I wish wizards got pets  [LOL and LOL again]  I'm glad there's class distinction though.<P>I must agree that having AT LEAST personal teleport presents much better flexibility for wizards in finding appropriate hunting ground or getting to geographically remote friends for grouping.  After all, wizards are really a group-oriented class.<P>Still, can't tell you how frustrating it can be to search for 30 mins or more for a hunting partner as a wizard when I can simply summon one as a mage.  Pets are just so cool and quite addictive.<P>For newbies trying to decide between mages and wizards, the simplist advice is go with the "am I a really social person" rule of thumb.  Wizards must rely on others more than mages...  Of course, you'll probably end up playing both eventually    <IMG SRC="http://www.everlore.com/boards/EL/smile.gif"><P>Raddz Mtaz<BR>L25 Mage on MM</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=7&topic=000059.cgi&ReplyNum=000009&forum=Magician|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Magi+or+Wiz">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana"><A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum7&number=7&thisthread=000059&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum7&number=7&thisthread=000059&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
