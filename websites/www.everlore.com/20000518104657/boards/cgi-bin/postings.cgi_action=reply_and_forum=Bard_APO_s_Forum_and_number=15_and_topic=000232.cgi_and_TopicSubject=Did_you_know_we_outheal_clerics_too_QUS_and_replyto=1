At least until they get complete heal at 39 - but thats not until 450 or so hours of playing.  And this is IN ADDITION to all the other stuff we do (read "No one outdamages a Bard" for more info)<BR>Just do the math with me a sec (or on your own if you wish.  <BR>Take a mature level 30 cleric - greater heal for 270 points or so - say 300 just to be nice - give the cleric 150 wisdom (pretty high for lev 30)<BR>That means he has 960 mana (fact).<BR>Work it out through testing and youll see it would take him around 65 seconds to meditate the 150 mana for the Gheal.  But we will err on the side of the cleric and say 60 seconds to be nice. So basically AT THE MOST he can heal 300 hp a minute.<BR>For us its easy - 10 ticks a minute - 15 hp a tick (with lute) - so 150 hp per person.<BR>So with 2 tanks we break even - 300 hp a minute.  WOW a bard keeping up with a cleric.  But what if there are 3 people taking damage as there often are - well step aside cleric - 450 hp a minute.  50% More! That can keep up with superior heal too.<BR>And of course if you really get beat up and have 5 people damaged (we've all been there) well thats 750 points a min...<BR>And dont tell me clerics buff AC so mobs hurt less because our speed buffs end the battle quicker and chains slows the mob 25-30% - we win that one too.  Im not saying clerics or other healers arent necessary - they CERTAINLY are - but just know that most of the time we are outhealing them.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Quinn</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Ok, Artian...we know.

It doesn't matter if there is a Cleric or a Bard, but how can we utilize each's abilities to better finish the critter safely for all members of our party. <P>The point might be well taken. With 3 tanks, it may be better to let the Bard do the Restorations, and the Cleric to help buff the mana users and so on. After a certain level (in these examples looked like 25+)this may change. <P>All in all, the thing we have to learn is how to maximize everyone's abilities. And in a group, this is always going to change and often we need to experiment to see what is most efficient. <P>I have teamed with a Cleric once, and he was ecstatic that all he had to regain was his mana, and not worry about HP. As have all Neromancers, Wizards and Enchanters I have worked with.<P>Moshkiae of the 13th Song</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Milli</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Unfortunately, you can't land all that healing on one or two people in thirty seconds. Which is nearly always where its needed.<P>So in fact you out heal an OOM cleric ?<P>Still pretty darn fine healing though, although over level thirty, I never see a bard using it (unless the **** hit the fan, and only one mob left), cos they have so many other groovy songs.<P>TTFN</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Raiel Kendan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">At level 44, my favorite group is 3 tanks, an enchanter, and a healer.  In this scenario, I whip out my lute and twist Hymns in with my mix.  If the tanks are doing their job correctly and spreading damage, the amount of healing we do during the fight means less downtime and mana consumption after the fight.  The healer is almost always FM at the end of the fight, and I can run out for the next pull when the mob is about 1/4 health.  Conversely, wielding weapons, the healer either has to spend post-fight mana healing everyone up (requiring mana-singing downtime) or I have to do it with my lute (everyone sitting on their butts going nowhere).<P>With 3 tanks, I will pretty much always pull out the lute.<P>Raiel Kendan, Traveling Minstrel of Karana<BR>Bard of the 44th Song<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Faldyyen Thunderleaf</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">You may able to outheal them in the long run, but that's doesn't mean too much. Clerics can sit, med, and when someone gets in trouble, they cast, and a few seconds the person is good as new. Bard healing is a plus, but kind of like a reverse DoT vs. DD debate. DoTs do more damage, but most of the time you don't have time to wait for it to run down.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Raiel Kendan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Here's my reasoning regarding Hymns/Heal:<P>With a heal, you have to wait until enough damage has been received to justify using the mana on a heal.  This means, the heals come later, thus mana used comes later.  The maan is expended more toward the end of the fight, meaning your clerics are not at full mana at the end of the fight.  Depending on how much they've used, your party may be sitting around on their duffs waiting for healer mana to be able to pull.  My melee contribution to the speed of taking down a mob does not make up for the time spent post-fight on healer meditation, in my observations.  (Note: This assumes three melee'ers are in the group, other than myself.  If there are only 2, it generally works out better to play the third melee role.)<P>With Hymns, you are doing the healing during the damage receipt.  There is no need to wait until the tank is down to 40% health to heal -- in fact, with 3 solid tanks sharing the damage, it's unlikely they'll get below 70%.  When the fight is over, health is in good shape, cleric has good mana, and you're free to pull.<P>Same reasoning applies to DoT/DD, I assume.  DoT'ers can DoT, then sit and med, and be at full mana when the fight is over.  DD'ers can't nuke at the beginning, or risk pulling the mob onto themselves.  DD'ers can finish the mob faster, but then have to med post-fight.  Each way probably takes about the same amount of time, but the DoT'er has less chance of pulling the mob onto himself, from what I've seen.<P>Raiel Kendan, Traveling Minstrel of Karana<BR>45th Bard of the Missing Song<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Moshkiae</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Once again, I really think that each situation will require different needs. It may be that we will be fighting a nasty caster, and the Cleric's help and DD may be more efficient, or otherwise. Or we maybe fighting a nasty hammer and he needs a different approach.<P>Basically, as I mentioned before, we need to concentrate on how the Cleric can help the Bard and the Bard help the Cleric. I have done this twice now, and we tested both times. Once I used all strings and asked the Cleric not to use the mana unless we needed a major push -- noticed that we have to be carefull here so we do not super impose the Bellow over another casting blast (one will get sidestepped, for example), so we would have a "push" when we needed it. The other time, I suggested he blast once AFTER the hammers get started (so not to pull critter to Cleric) and then sit back to restore the mana, and let us finish things.<P>Once again, the matter here is not who heals better or faster, but how we can COMMUNICATE to be more efficient. The two examples I had pretty much worked out to the same "result". My preference is that we have the mana for serious moments that we may need it, since a caster, or neo-caster without mana can be a bit of a liability. However, with the strings on, I have yet to lose a caster in a normal size group taking on MOB's either at Crushbone or the orc Camps. Yes, they needed to med back up, but all in all I like the safety of having a push if we need it, and I find that very important. But each situation requires a different handling of things.<P>Moshkiae</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Tgcid</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">I think your healing spell is pretty wasted after you get the mana song, it is much better to be playing that and regening your cleric's mana then be playing your healing song. Oh and at 30 non twinked I had 172 wis, and thats pretty average. The last 30 wis points are generally the slowest for us.<BR>And as for the arguement that bards are better healers then clerics, have you looked into the mana efficient spells we get at 34? Word of healing and Superior healing both can be casted for very little mana cost relatively...<BR>And I almost never run out of mana, so in fact you will never outheal me because I don't go oom. If a cleric learns to play their class right, they should not be going oom that often heh  <IMG SRC="http://www.everlore.com/boards/EL/smile.gif"><P>------------------<BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/timessquare/avatar/8033/pics/headpic3.jpg><BR>Tgcid Stormcaller 40th Cleric of MithMarr<BR>Member of Divine Destiny<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Raiel Kendan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Heya, Tgcid,<P>  Don't worry, we're definitely not advocating that clerics are not needed.  The thread would probably be more appropriately titled something such as "How we can ease the burden of the cleric."<P>  With my favorite group mentioned above (3 tanks, enc, bard, healer [cleric when available]), there is a big difference in downtime when I use the lute during the fight and when I don't.  Mana song can not be effectively twisted (requires 2 out of 3 song twist slots to twist it), whereas Hymns can be.  Thus, while us playing pure mana song may be more beneficial than us playing pure Hymns, we wouldn't be able to do the other things we do during the fight and still be able to achieve that.  Hymns, however, only requires 1 of 3 song slot twists for full effectiveness, thus allowing two other combat or crowd control related tasks.<P>  Again, do not think the bards are advocating that we don't need clerics.  If there isn't a healer in the group, I get very nervous doing the things I normally do.  Bards love clerics.  As Moshkiae pointed out, it isn't an issue of who can heal best (I'd say Clerics, hands down), but how we best can complement each other.  With one twist, we can very easily lighten the load on the cleric, and even allow him/her to use some of the spells they don't get to often use (ie, a nuke or two -- everyone needs to have a little fun).<P>Raiel Kendan, Traveling Minstrel of Karana<BR>Bard of the 45th Whistled Tune<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Tgcid</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">*nods*  <IMG SRC="http://www.everlore.com/boards/EL/smile.gif"><P>------------------<BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/timessquare/avatar/8033/pics/headpic3.jpg><BR>Tgcid Stormcaller 40th Cleric of MithMarr<BR>Member of Divine Destiny</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Moshkiae</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">>>>And I almost never run out of mana, so in fact you will never outheal me because I don't go oom.

If cards played right, as you say, everyone should have mana and HP on the right place, and the down time will be minimized for all, WHICH should be the goal. In highly dangerous, strong spawn areas, this is a must.<P>I never want to worry about who does more damage. I just want to augment everyone's damage, cleric or otherwise, but it is a bonus if we get to the end of this MOB and we have some mana to spare and HP to spare. Much safer, and smarter. This is the only point I would like to make.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Moshkiae</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Someone mentioned that in one very high level they had a Bard and two Clerics. One Cleric's job was to make sure the Bard did not lose HP. The 2nd Bard's job was to make sure that the 1st Cleric did not lose his mana. And this way the other 3 tanks did the rest and the Bard was able to use the DoT songs. <P>I actually thought this was funny, but I guess it is effective. I would rather wait a little before playing a DoT to pull the mobs to me. But I did notice something the other night rather interesting. In a group fighting a Dervish Camp in RO and I had the strings on with Restoration since the others needed HP. The MOB came to me immediately (only three of them). Noticed that as they hit me, they were doing minimal damage, and the others could hit them behind their backs ... that was interesting. I held up fine. <P>Just tells me that my future is not with a weapon, but an instrument. Or the truth maybe that I can better defend with the Strings (at this level) than with a weapon in my hand. <P>Certainly a note that I want to tuck away into my think tank. I am not sure that this would be AS EFFICIENT if we had a nasty caster, and I may have to twist Bellow or equivalent (I'm only 14th song) to hold them at bay. <P>Moshkiae</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Moshkiae</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">>>>is much better to be playing that and regening your cleric's mana then be playing your healing song.

I reload the cleric, and the cleric reloads everyone else. The cleric reloads me and I reload everyone else. Probably about even, I bet (just 1cp).<P>I figured this out earlier, when I noticed that the down time and the length of the fight were juxtaposed. Faster fight=Spent Energy=Long rest period. Slower fight=Less spent energy=smaller rest period. The end result ends up in the same (let's say) five minutes to have everyone up to 100%. I actually think that this is the way that things are configured and how they adjust one's hp/ac/atk configuration. <P>Verant's chart has some sort of equation that balances these things out ... so in the end, chances are that there is no way that a Cleric, or a Bard can out-damage each other in a group.<P>The only variant here should be IF there is a Level differential between the two characters, like I am 5 levels below you or so, or vice versa, for which we have new songs/spells that have a marked difference.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></td></tr></table>
