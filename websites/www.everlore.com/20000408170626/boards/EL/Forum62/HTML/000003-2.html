</FONT><HR>>>>Holy crap Jasmine can you stop being so bloody negative! Read my reply on the Wizards forum DIRECTED AT YOU AND SOLEY YOU!!! Man you may have gotten the Wizards petition going but since then every damn post that you write is NEGATIVE!!! <P>Not every post I have written has been negative.  In fact most of my post have not been negative although you seem to only isolate those out in that small little mind of yours.  I read you post and replied to it and noticed you havent posted there since.. heh.  What you call negative post I call the truth, because it is.  Anyone that actually plays the game knows it is.  Verant leaves it self wide open for attack by providing poor service on several ends.  Sure, they have thier good qualities and I acknowledge those too.  On this issue, they have already stated it isn't coming out on time.  Paineel and the Hole are the same way, promised release date last year and to this day they still arent up.  The list goes on...<P>>>>Get off of it dreamer this is not a perfect world, stop complaining and start doing something about it.<P>I am doing something about it.  You have read the post.  I make the customers realize the truth and what they are missing.  I also make them realize there is bigger and better things out there then EQ planned in the future.  I'm use realistic ideas... having a good and competent customer support as well as delivering what is promised with minor delays expected is a bit more realistic then ignoring customers and consistently delaying product/upgrade releases.  It's not a dream at all, in the real world the best provider of services or goods get the money.  EQ can easily be outclassed in both categorys considering how the MMORPG market is still very young.<P>>>> Don't tell me that Verant never listens either, the petition thing was definetly heard, you may fail you may succeed but complaining and giving everyone a bad taste in their mouths is just what a whinning dreamer does.<P>HAHAHAHAHA... really, no.. lol.  You consider the truth complaining, then you might wanna re-evaluate your argument here.  The petition issues and the changes they made have NOTHING to do with each other.  You obviously haven't read the petition.<P>Jayle, grow up.. if you dont like hearing the truth then go sit in a corner and ***** to yourself, seriously.  You wanna talk about doing something not productive, read your own post.. heh.<P>Jas<p>[This message has been edited by Jasmine (edited 01-31-2000).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=62&topic=000003.cgi&ReplyNum=000025&forum=Ruins+of+Kunark&TopicSubject=Ruins+of+Kunark">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>Hmm Jasmine, I disagree with you entirely. Do you realize that there are countries smaller than the 250 000 player base? There are so few actuall EQ employees that they are swamped. Such a big world that they are overloaded with work. How can you possibly say that Verant is doing nothing for its customers? What are all of the changes for? What about the patch every 2 weeks? Do you not understand the type of work required for this? Obviously your small mind is out to godamn lunch. <P>Hey this is a big job started by a small company that has brought more joy to its customers than ANY OTHER COMPUTER GAME IN HISTORY. And you stand around *****ing that a few people were accidently kicked off the game because of a mistake? Do you change countries when you hear of people being put into jail for a crime that they didn't commit, only because the justice system is not perfect? Man!!! Anyways they are swamped with e-mail, and it takes a week to get back to anyone. Also it would take a while to look into why someone was banished,mistake or not. I seriuosly doubt, that just because you zoned into a zone that there was an error occuring in that zone that you would just be banished. If that ever happened its a mistake. Verants not perfect, i'm not perfect nor are you and especially the whole human civilzation is far from perfect. Verant obviously ignores people only because they get 5000 e-mails a day,they have little choice unless they hear enough of an uproar on a subject. Its not a great system but if I can get this much enjoyment out of a game for 5 months then i'm not complaining, why are you?<P>Jasmine, you have helped me a lot and I know its wrong of me to be so negative towards you and I apologise. I will not write a negative post to you again. I am not always here to read the posts thats why there was the delay. Lets stop this stupid thing, I was a jerk and thats that. To understand why I posted these things towards you: I was agreeing with you on a lot of your topics till you posted other links to other games that are coming out, hey that would be fine and all but you started preaching how bad EQ is and that you will leave as soon as you get the chance. Come on pls don't do that.<P>------------------<BR>If you only knew what I know, you would not be so secure, times will be changing.<p>[This message has been edited by Jayle (edited 02-01-2000).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=62&topic=000003.cgi&ReplyNum=000027&forum=Ruins+of+Kunark&TopicSubject=Ruins+of+Kunark">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>Jasmine,<P>As an software 'industry insider' maybe I can answer your question.  I'm not 'defending Verant' this is just how things are and how I've seen them work for years.<P>What you're seeing is a truism of the software industry.  It's called 'value added'.  It is very very customary for 'next releases' to have significant new features added without a change in the price of the package.   Usually, Sales&Marketting has already worked out 'what the traffic will bear' the first go around and increasing the price is just not an option-- EQ makes money at 40$ a pop.  It may well make LESS money at 60$ a pop even WITH the expansion.<P>Moreover, usually, when a new release comes out, to get the new features you have to buy the WHOLE new release. Incremental expansions are a comparative rarity.<P>So, could pay 15 (10, 20 whatever) bucks and buy an expansion pack or you could pay 40bucks and buy the whole new release 'over again'.  <P>Consider hardware.  They keep adding features (speed, size, etc) but the price is relatively the same.  Is it fair that a monster Pentium III costs the same as a 286 did 15yrs ago?  Those poor 286 buyers really got ripped for not waiting eh?<P>As to your 'what have we been paying 10$ a month for'.  You've been paying that for access to the servers. It's the difference between capital costs (the cd) and operating costs (being able to connect and play).  The 10 bucks a month is paying for the current server farm PLUS those new servers we've been demanding and the lines to feed them and the people to babysit them and and and...  The money you spend on service doesn't go in a big vault so they can give you capital items for free.  It is the other half of the whole that makes EQ possible.  Just like buying gas for your car doesn't make your next car cheaper. (a weak and easily overstressed analogy, but I hope you see the point).<P>Incidentally...<P>Three months ago I noted a universal DROP in the price of EQ (from 65$Cdn to 45$Cdn).  This may well have been in anticipation of Kunark which will probably retail at around 65$Cdn again (for the FULL install).  So I may just be getting Kunark for about the same price as a first time buyer.  I can live with that!<P>Even if not, I really don't expect to get a whole new continent by virtue of being a 'loyal customer'.  That's just unreasonable.<BR>I'll get more and I'll pay for it. Fair exchange.   If you don't think it's worth the money then don't buy it or go buy one of those other games you've been touting when THEY come out.  But, you can lay off now. You've said your piece and we all heard you.<P>Regretably, I must agree with Jayle that you have become perceptively more hostile and negative towards Verant since you started your (very sensible and sadly ignored) spell cap petition.<P>Warmest Regards,<BR>Tubineus<BR>Magician<BR>Scholar<BR>Letch<BR>Bristlebane Server<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=62&topic=000003.cgi&ReplyNum=000028&forum=Ruins+of+Kunark&TopicSubject=Ruins+of+Kunark">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>I completely agree, I think that is perfectly reasonable to charge at least 20 or 40 dolloars for this game.  Complaining isnt going to change the price and you know just as I do that you would buy it if it were 60 dollors!    Because you cant stop playing!  It is a drug!  IT IS EVERCRACK!  <P><BR>I am playing a gnome wizard and I know i will still play him.  But i am sure that i will at least make a Lizard guy and probably go into the new city to see it, and then play it, and play it, and play it till i like him way too much!<P><BR>Also i am glad that there will be another Monk race even though the idea of Lizard monks id really dumb.  The reason i am glad is because i am plaing in the commonlands right now and i am sooo sick of seeing humans!  I hate humans!  They are the dumbest looking characters in the game!Whenever i see one that cons blue i just wish that we were both PvP!  HAHAHA i just went back and read this and i am really rambling on.  Oh well, these are all just my personal opinions so dont take them to heatr and get really mad or delete your human after reading this.<P><BR>Well...thats all i have to say right now.<P><BR>Happy Hunting and Good luck to you all!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=62&topic=000003.cgi&ReplyNum=000030&forum=Ruins+of+Kunark&TopicSubject=Ruins+of+Kunark">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>I think that Verant has this idea that Kunark is going to bring other players to the game and such. Basically all it is going to do is have all the old users drop their main charactes and go pick up a new one. Also, we know that there are going to be zones for all Level 50's and above and this is going, hopefully, going to alleviate some overflow in various zones in the game.<P>But I really doubt, with all my heart, since there have been no indications to that effect, that Verant is working on making sure they have a good product that does not crash so daing much. It is inexcusable in this day and age for any program to be crashing this much unless its main design configuration is poop. In the past month, Verant has really messed up the game and made it very difficult for individuals to join their friends ... and not all of us have DSL or Cable where we can ignore the size of the packets in these games.<P>All in all there are major server side issues, and Kunark is not going to fix those. Until those issues are resolved, this game will be doing itself a dis-service and hurting its future. It's their game, so if they want to screw things up, go ahead ... but when it takes 40 people to kill a God, it will take 60 to kill one of the level 75 critters ... and right now the Lag and problems in the game are so bad when in crazy zones, that you really think this is gonna get better with tougher and bigger critters? You gotta be kidding me.<P>Moshkiae</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=62&topic=000003.cgi&ReplyNum=000032&forum=Ruins+of+Kunark&TopicSubject=Ruins+of+Kunark">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >
