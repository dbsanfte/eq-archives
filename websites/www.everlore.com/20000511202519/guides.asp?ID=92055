1. USE PROPER GRAMMAR! I cannot stress this enough. If you change one thing about the way you play, change THIS. "R u want to group" is a tell most people will ignore right off the bat. Don't abbreviate - take the 1.2 seconds to type the extra letters in the word - it will definitely improve your dealings with others.

2. Try to roleplay. You don't have to, but roleplayers get better responses when looking for groups, they occasuionally get more money and more responses in auctions, and they are looked upon as more intelligent players overall.
 
3. Don't beg. Usually a /shout or /ooc of "Can anyone spare some change for a newbie?" (or armor, etc.) is met with hostility, jeers, and rudeness. This is because we have all had to WORK for our money and items, and we expect you to do the same. Now, many people are HAPPY to help newbies if you PHRASE things the right way. Do not ask for money. Try this - /auc "WTB - decent newbie weapon. I can't pay much but I will be very grateful". This sounds like you are at least willing to pay something (even a copper), which is respectable, and it also gets word out that you are a struggling newbie and some generous folk will help you.

4. Looking for a group? So is everyone else. You need to employ a little salesmanship here. "Lvl 10 shaman looking fr group" is not likely to get much response. However "Brave Shaman in tenth season is looking for hunting fellows in the Tundra!" is different, noticeable, and marks you as a somewhat witty and fun to be with!
 
5. don't be discouraged if your auction, shout, or ooc is not answered right away. If you ask a question, and no one answers, you only make it FAR worse by following up with "you ppl r rude!" Instead, wait several minutes (15 - 20, don't spam) and ask again. 
 
These tips are sure to increase your enjoyment of the game, and give your character a distinct presence in Norrath. Happy hunting!</font></td></tr>-->

				 for the most part i think your right, but i know from lots and lots of experiance that asking people nicely for items works very well. Someone was even going to give me crushes tunic(no joke) for free just because i asked for it. I was given bronze and cast iron rapires and a fs short sword for free. I also got a cutthroat insignia ring. Usually when somebody says &quot;first lvl 1 druid to poke me gets a free gift&quot;, ill go and poke them and act surprised when they say &quot;your not a druid&quot;. In this case i was given 2 scrolls that sold for about 1pp each at a merchant. I dont care if im a begger, at least im not dead or low on cash. <BR>
       and im sure everyone who read this can guess what class i am. You guessed it a rogue  <BR>
