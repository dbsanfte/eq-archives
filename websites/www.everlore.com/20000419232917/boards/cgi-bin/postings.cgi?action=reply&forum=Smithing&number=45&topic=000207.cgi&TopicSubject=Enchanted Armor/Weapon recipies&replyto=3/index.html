[B]Maybe, kind of like Wu's Gauntlets for Monks. But what would be the point, given the availablility of cheap combine weaps?

*If* they ever add the weaps, which I doubt, it seems more likely that it would:

1) Require very high smithing skill. The best jewelry doesn't trivial, even at 200 skill. That would probably be the case for the enchanted weaps, too - this serves to reduce the # items out there, so an enchanted forged sword doesn't become the standard newbie weap.

2) Have either an expensive component (jewel) or a rare component (rare drop mold or something) as part of the recipes.

The other alternative is what you said - that neither of the above is true, and that all you need is to mix in a GLS or a vial of viscous mana or some other common ingredient. But the result would be a rather weak weapon (same as forged weapons, but magic) - in which case, what's the point?

I'd prefer #1 and #2 above with a resulting nice weapon, to the other option (weak, easy to make weapon).

I have played since Beta 2 and they have barely ever changed anything except to adjust prices of items (with the exception of adding silk armor pieces).  They have not added ONE DAMN ITEM to smithing.  I think that they are simply too LAZY or want to get more money (expansion or something like that).  They are not interested in increasing the enjoyment of the current players, they simply want to maintain the status quo.<BR>That is why you will not see any new items for Smithing.  Making it more expensive to get better at smithing, such as making the banded available at the low 40s-high 60s and then making chain, scale, plate at the higher levels of smithing would allow someone to spend 350-500plat to get up to the good stuff.  I guess they simply expect people to just kill the guards for the money instead of making it an item we can make. Come on, they haven't even added weapons and the game has been out for well over a year.  They aren't going to add them unless we throw a BIG stink.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Ratmaster2000</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Ah, what game are you playing?

After all, we currently can make only banded armor and 3 forged weapons.  true, there's stuff we can make for bakers, but what kind of market is that??  i would suggest to verant that sometime in the future they implement some higher level stuff for us to make.  who knows? there may be a way to make it now, but those who may know sure aren't telling, not that i blame them.  <BR>But i thought a clue might have been the folded sheet of metal as described in the basic smith book.  but combining a block of ore with water does NOTHING.  Whether this item may be relevant to plate armor or not is still reletively unknown, but we should at least be able to make it to try out for ourselves.<P>Sir Balgus of the Knights of Truth<BR>Paladin of the 18th Circle<BR>Master Smith</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">stumped</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana"> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Krasx:<BR><B>Let's face it people:  If anyone figures out how to make enchanted weapons or armor, do you really think they would just share that information with the message boards?
