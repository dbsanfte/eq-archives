Turns out Giagas, as he is known on Quellious, does this a lot. He pulled a switch on me as I was trying to buy something and I lost 30pp to him. I admit I was stupid enough to not recheck the item, so I advise anyone who wishes to obtain items this way, to check and recheck before hitting that trade button. I've learned my lesson the hard way and won't be using the auction route again. It was very disappointing and depressing, since I've met a majority of very nice and very ethical people. But these are real people playing a game, so I am now a wiser, albeit a little more guarded, gameplayer. I will say that there were a TON of players who rallied behind me afterwards and offered support, money, dueling privileges <smile>, etc., so I thank all of those wonderful people on Quellious. The game goes on!</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Divad</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Heard about this guy all night that night....avoid him.....</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Scrawny Knoll</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Also watch out for a character named Tootles who sells screaming maces.

He has a nasty habit of acting like a friend, then making off with all the group loot. He will let you die, then offer to loot your stuff and bring it back to you, then log off with it all. He also frequently cheats in deals. Beware, as more than one friend of mine has had reason to complain about this person.<P>------------------<BR>Helen Gurley Brown:<BR>"Good girls go to heaven, bad girls go everywhere."</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Caveat Emptor</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">I think it would be great if there could be a "/who scammers" list to check for each zone  <IMG SRC="http://www.everlore.com/boards/EL/smile.gif">  People that have been complained about on several occasions could be added, and other, newer users wouldn't get fleeced as often.

I've had two deals with that sour twit that went bad. No robberies, just attempts to pull wool over your eyes and make you pay more than something is worth.

I personally have never been jacked on Quellious, and more than one person has had the opportunity to do so, but if they had I think I should be able to get it back (maybe one player kill per RL week per character).

I think he uses tow computers, cause he was never seen again.  PP down the drain.  It's a shame that people do this.  Guess they don't care about anyone but themselves.  I try not to buy from people that are that much lower level than me now, It usually stops the thievery.  Im at 24, and if they con blue to red to me, I figure that they will have the character on the game for a while.  So they wont camp, come back later, pass over the good to another player, then cancel the character.  Such a shame really.  Just beware before you click trade.  Don't fall for the "I have to log ...hurry hurry," rush routine.  Any if they show you the goods once, don't asume when it comes trade time that it will be the same thing.  These two things are what got me.  I was rushed, the price was good and the A hole showed me the Mace once but when I went to the bank, he put in a rusty for the trade.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Baxt</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">I'm sorry to hear about the bad traders and am glad to hear about the EQ Patch regarding trades.<P>As a small spot of hope on this day, I offer my services.  I'm a Barbarian in Halas and have gotten my skill in tailoring up enough that I can competently make PW armor.  If you approach me with a bear pelt and a pattern, I will make you some armor at no additional charge.  If you catch me on a good day(i.e. I have money), I might even buy the pattern for you.<P>I can cast SoW and other buffs as well.  I know a lot of people charge for this.  If people give me money, I certainly don't turn it away, but if you need a buff, just ask.  I won't make you pay me for it.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Fenre</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">  I've got a question though.  If the person who baits you and then trades a rusty or whatnot is a rogue or evil race type, isn't it just good RPing?  I mean hey.. that seems a TOTALLY acceptable tactic for the Roguish folk... you don't expect us to get jobs like the rest of you folk, do you?<BR>  Being the honest rogue that I am though, you'd *never* have to verify something I'm trading you.

I hate being cheated, though it is most of the time my fault. Every since lvl 8 when I was robbed of 7pp (alot for me at that time, I was just starting out) by thinking I was buying leather but being given PW instead! I don't remember the name, but it was a barbarian warrior. <BR>But don't always accuse people of stealing right away, I once had a strange accident where a paladin wanted to try on my hat (scarab helm) and when he gave it back his banded helm was gone. We never found it. Or I didn't, maybe he did later on.
