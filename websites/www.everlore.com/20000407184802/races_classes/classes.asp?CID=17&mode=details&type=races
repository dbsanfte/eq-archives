				Note:  This info is based on what I have experienced from being in a group with a shamen.<BR>
<BR>
Which are the two best classes to have in a group?  Bards, and SHAMANs.<BR>
<BR>
Friends take my advice, you have never been 'buffed' until you've been buffed by a shaman.  They have spells that will raise every single attribute that you have, plus spells that make you run faster, fight harder, and heal faster.  They are decent fighters (at low level before anyone can afford decent armor they are as good or better in combat then a cleric), and they have excellent physical stats because of the races that they have to choose from.<BR>
Far to often the Shaman class is overlooked by those trying to create a new and different character.<BR>
But then thats just my opinion...I could be wrong.

				The Shaman<BR>
<BR>
The shaman is a great class, which offers a tons role-play opportunity in EverQuest.   First, they are only for the &#8220;Large&#8221; races (Barbarians, Trolls, and Ogres).  You are the Wise one in the midst of mindless warriors, eager for the slaughter.  You are responsible for guiding your brethren, because you are wise.  Being of a big race gives you a nice advantage when first starting out, as you will have an easier time gaining your first few levels.  Second, you&#8217;re probably going to be rare.  Most people who play the big races want to be the strong warrior or shadowknight.  They will probably wonder why you&#8217;re a shaman as they go stomping about the newbie grounds killing everything in sight.  When they die again and again from levels 5 up, they start to shout:  &#8220;Looking for shaman level 6-8!&#8221;,  &#8220;Can anybody heal me?&#8221;, &#8220;Can someone plz cure my plague rat disease?&#8221;  <BR>
<BR>
Once they have partied with a shaman, they will always want a shaman.  Here&#8217;s why.  You can buff.  Shaman buffs are the second best in the game (behind Enchanters) but you have more buffs to choose from.  Virtually every physical attribute (like Strength, Agility, Dexterity) can be raised through your buff spells.  You can heal.  This dramatically reduces time warriors spend sitting on their butts.  You can draw enemies.  Although shaman damage spells are pretty weak, they will get a monster&#8217;s attention and draw him to your party.  If a warrior wants to do this, he has to run up to the monster and start attacking it.  You&#8217;ll see lots of guys chasing down mobs, too, when a few of your spells can finish it off.  Eventually shamans get nice DOT (damage over time) spells.<BR>
<BR>
The starting shaman<BR>
<BR>
When distributing your starting ability points, your race is fairly important.  I suggest putting a few points into agility and the rest into Wisdom.  Wisdom directly affects your mana.  And if you are playing well, you will need as much mana as possible.  You are a big race and will start out stronger than most warriors in the game.  Don&#8217;t put any in Stamina for the same reason.  The rest of your stats are not bad.  Don&#8217;t waste any on Charisma.  You might consider a few in Int to help with skill learning, but I wouldn&#8217;t even do that.  Focus on 1. Wis 2. Agility.  Not being hit is often more important than hitting for a few extra points of damage.<BR>
<BR>
You start out with 2 spells (Inner fire and Minor healing) in addition to a newbie club and food, water, guild note, and your PK book.  Be sure to scribe these spells into your spell book before you do anything else.  The reason is that if you die without having scribed those spells you lose them.  Poof.  Don&#8217;t do that.  <BR>
<BR>
After giving the note to your guildmaster, train 5 points in 1 &#8211;Handed Blunt, memorize the two spells and head out to your local newbie area.  I have played both a Troll and a Barbarian shaman, and think that Barbarians have a little easier time starting out, mainly because there are more players around to help you out.  Also, the Barbarians have merchants in the newbie zone, so you don&#8217;t have to go very far to resupply or sell your goods.<BR>
<BR>
Tactics<BR>
Cast Inner fire on yourself, this will give you a few extra hit points and an armor class bonus.  Make Slam a hot key.  It usually won&#8217;t do much damage, but then again, most newbie creatures can&#8217;t take a lot of damage.  Many shaman forget that as a big race, you start with the Slam skill.  Use it!  At first you&#8217;ll be running up to monsters and attacking them.  Keep bashing until it is dead.  As soon as you&#8217;ve saved up some money (around 1.5 gold or so) immediately go back to town to buy Burst of Flame spell.  Memorize this spell and head back out.  I usually have both the healing spell and the Burst of Flame spell on hot keys.<BR>
<BR>
With burst of flame you become much better at killing things.  Use it first on a monster to get its attention.  It will only do about 4 damage, but the monster will run right up to you.  No chasing it down like a grunt warrior.  You can pick your battles.  (If you see a warrior trying to run up and attack a creature, don&#8217;t steal it from him, even though you can.  This is rude.)  Your main priority is decaying skeletons with weapons.  Always always always attack decaying skeletons with weapons.  You will make more money that way than any other as a newbie, and you stand a good chance of getting a weapon you can use.<BR>
<BR>
Level 2<BR>
When you hit level 2, life becomes a little easier.  Save your practice/training points.  You don&#8217;t need to use them yet.  You have more mana, more hit points, and more money.  Your next goal is to get money to buy 2 more spells:  Strengthen and Dextrous Aura.  These are buff spells and they make you even with Warriors in terms of battle.  With Strengthen, Dextrous Aura and Inner Fire, you should be able to safely handle anything in the newbie zones except multiple monsters.  There are exceptions to this (Trolls have to face a Fungus tracker which tends to spawn right at the beginning of the zone.)  Don&#8217;t waste money on Endure cold.  No one is attacking you with cold attacks just yet.  Flash of Light can help in a tight situation, but it&#8217;s better to just use Burst of Flame.  Practice using it in between monster attacks while fighting.  Before you know it, you&#8217;ll be level 3.<BR>
<BR>
Level 3 <BR>
At this point you&#8217;re even stronger and the newbie monsters won&#8217;t even be a challenge.  Be sure to save all of those Bear pelts for level 3.  When you hit level 3, go back to your guild and train 10 practice points (you did save them didn&#8217;t you?) into Tailoring.  Trust me on this one.  You should also have enough money for a tailoring kit and the &#8220;How to Sew&#8221; book or pamphlet.   Now you can make your own patchwork armor from the bear pelts.  Don&#8217;t even bother with buying any armor yet.  Just use those pelts and buy a pattern and put them in the sewing kit.   You might fail a few times.  I had 6 pelts to practice with and was successful 4 out of the 6 times.  One of the failures actually raised my skill 1 point to 11.  Now you want to keep fighting bear cubs and even buying pelts from other players until you have a full set of patchwork.  As a Troll shaman you should always be on the lookout for Froglok tads which can carry pieces of netted armor.<BR>
<BR>
Future levels<BR>
The first spell to buy at level 5 is Create water.  This will save you and your party much money over time.  You can even store created water in the bank and retrieve it.  The second spell to buy is Feet like Cat.  This is an agility buff spell, and makes you harder to hit.  If you are low on mana, use this buff spell first, because agility directly affects how often you are hit.  Trust me.  This is more important than strength of dexterity.  Other useful spells are Drowsy (a debuffing spell which slows a monster&#8217;s attacks) and Fleeting Fury which is like a temporary boost to your stats.  All of the spells at this level are useful, and I would buy that Endure cold spell you skipped on earlier too.  You can make some money by making patchwork for other players, but most you will get from adventuring.  Money will always be tight like any spellcaster, but your situation is a little worse than most, because you also have armor and weapons to worry about.  Get the spells first and armor second.  At this point you will know how to play your character as well as anyone.<BR>
<BR>
General tips<BR>
At low levels you can fight as well as a tank and help speed the recovery process with healing spells.  Your main strength will be in Buffing other players and keeping them alive to fight for you.  You can go in and bash with the best of them, but your main priority is keeping them alive, by healing and making them stronger.  Be friendly to those around you.  Cast buff spells on people you don&#8217;t know and always heal someone if they are about to die.  Warriors may laugh until you save their butt, and then you will have their respect forever.  Later in life, you might want to find a Monk to team up with.  Your buffing spells will make that character a Mega tank.   Clerics and Shaman start out similar in that they are like a hybrid class, fighting and casting.  But Shaman will always be better at melee, because of your naturally high race stats.  When you factor in your buff spells, Shaman can almost go solo through the entire game.<BR>

				Troll Friends,<BR>
If you crush food, and wanna be magjick user, da great power of shaman will be good choooice.<BR>
<BR>
Here is a little guide, when just newborn,<BR>
Lv 1-5:<BR>
Give note, to Shaman leader (He is in &quot;Root of Innuruuk&quot;), wear all. Go to swamp. When entering swamp, take directly to the left, and pass the second basher, and stay there.<BR>
Thats a very good 'hunting-spot' to start at, kill some critters, you need like 2 yella shinies, then head back to leader, buy &quot;Burst Of Flame&quot; from leaders friend. Go back to 'hunting-spot'. Now you just pick monster-food with &quot;burst of flame&quot;, not so much runner anymore. Depending on how many Trolls there are in da area, you will hit LV 5, in no time, app 3 Hrs. And also use second Basher if in trouble, he kill critters for you..wich means that you have close to safe-spot also...and if you die, you will be respawned at safe-spot....get da idea of hunting-spot greatness?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
-Rememba before enter swamp, study spells, or they will be gone if Troll dies....<BR>
<BR>
-Rememba to go back to leader, buy Strengthen and Dexterity spell from da leader friends, when you got more of da yella shinies...<BR>
<BR>
- It can be nice to save skinny man leftover, da bone chips, you not need them, but troll friends need them, they buy them for plenty of shinies....<BR>
<BR>
- Rememba to save snake scales, you will need them later, cast snake skin spell... <BR>
<BR>
- Rememba you close to LV 4, and short of food in bag, visit our God, for a short while, and you got new food in bag...<BR>
<BR>
Take care of food, and not speak when eating!<BR>
<BR>

				Barbarian Shaman:<BR>
<BR>
There are many advantages and disadvantages to  playing a barbarian shaman over a troll or ogre.  If the other guides haven't convinced you that being a shaman is a top choice, I suggest you try it for a few levels - you'll be sold.<BR>
<BR>
PROS: Halas and Everforst. These are truly superb hunting grounds for levels 1 - 5. Not only are there tons of MOBs, but they carry excellent loot. Gnoll <BR>
pups and Ice goblin whelps often drop backpacks and bags which saves you one decision regarding initial investments. As you will have such good strength you <BR>
can carry a lot more equipment, and therefore make less trips home for selling. There are also some shop<BR>
keepers outside the city so you don't have to zone.<BR>
One of the most impressive things about Everfrost is the variety of players. There are often very high level characters there preparing for a journey into Permafrost, so you can get lots of advice. Another advantage to starting in Halas is the quests. There are literally dozens of them, and some of them give really useful items and gold. For example, I have received five of my spells through questing - always a <BR>
nice gift!. Once you move up to levels 6 and above, it gets  a little more difficult, and having played a lot of<BR>
different class combos, I have to say I think that level 8 for a shaman is harder than any other I have encountered. You simply must group or you will never get to the new rank of spells.<BR>
<BR>
Barbarian buffs are the best. You can buff specifically  without wasting mana, keeping the agility for spellcasters<BR>
and the others for tanks. You can melee blues up to level 8  without any spells if you choose wisely! That plus the fact that shamans get Wolf Spirit at level nine (and not fourteen like druids)<BR>
makes it worth while on it's own.<BR>
<BR>
CON: Despite what I have heard other people say, I have seen an awful lot of Barbarian shamen. In fact, Everforst seems to be overloaded with them, as the only choices for a barbarian are warrior, rogue and shaman. So, if you don't mind others of your class all around, go for it. The other downside to playing a barbarian shaman is night vision. In Everfrost, this handicap cannot be  overestimated. It gets PITCH BLACK at night, and is very easy to get<BR>
lost. God forbid you should die without taking a /loc. However, you o eventually get the spell 'Serpent Sight' which makes life a lot easier.<BR>
<BR>
If you do decide to play a Barbarian Shaman, I would say prepare for three things. A quick start, with good loot and some excellent starting stats. Difficult middle levels which can be soloed but with a lot of difficulty, and finally a great role-play character that becomes more and more enjoyable once you<BR>
surpass the nightmare level 8!<BR>
<BR>
Enjoy!<BR>

				  I just started a Barbarian Shaman and I love him. I think I you want to be a Barbarian being a Shaman is the only way to go. Because you are still a great fighter but you also get great buffer spells to help you. <BR>
  You also get to start in Halas which is a great place to start because of the polar bear cub which give you bear pelts, so you can make your own armor. So I just have to say that a Barbarian Shaman may be very well the best class and race to be period.<BR>

				I made a Barbarian Warrior and Barbarian Shaman, and  I believe I like the shaman best.  At first I was thinking &quot;yeah Im gonna make him buff&quot; but then I saw all the hides I was getting and then CHING CHING  I saw there was good profit in tailoring so what I did was go the route of smith/tailor/Shaman.  After I would level up I would start off any skills that needed starting at that level and then I would work them up to good stature.  I still fight and raise my skills, but I spend all my extra points into tailoring and smithing until 15 each, thats when I start to tailor.   I cant get ore yet because I have to travel to Qeynos and I dont feel like doing that yet.  So I stay and I tailor my hides and sell them to the npcs for now.   Later Im hoping to make reinforced and studded armor and selling it all around.  I think it would be even more neat if we Shamans can enchant our hides at higher levels like enchanters can enchant jewelry. This way we can make Polar bear capes like the NPC Hagar (which dies often to higher level players because of their greed for the Cape of the Ice Bear he has on him).  This way if someone knows a good tailor they can give the polar bear hide to the tailor and he can enchant it with a endure cold spell or heat spell and it would make the polar bear cape more versitile.  Can you see a polar bear cape with Inner Fire or another Ac/Hp boosting spell on it??   It would make the player to player buying and selling alot better.  There would be more interaction between players.   Im just now starting to tailor but Ill be great at it soon and anyone who reads this can look me up soon on Bristlebane.

Okay, as you've probably read already, you start out with food, drink, Inner Fire scroll, Minor Healing scroll, and a club.  The first thing to do is scribe and memorize your spells.  Then buff yourself with Inner Fire.  Next go to the guild house and turn in your note.  Put all 5 points into Fishing (it's a great way to make money early on).  Now, hail the Troll you gace the note to and get the quest where you got to turn in 2 Bone Chips and 2 Pieces of Froglok Tad Skin.  Then, go out into Innothule Swamp, and remember to re-buff yourself whenever needed.  Loot everything worth more than 4 copper (looting 1 cp snake fangs is basically pointless) definitely go after Decaying Skeletons they have nice loot, and remember to get the Bone Chips for the quest.  Also kill Froglok Tads they occasionally drop Netted armor (same AC as cloth, magical, fits all) which is up to you whether you want to sell it or wear it.  After you got 2 Bone Chips and 2 Pieces of Froglok Tadpole Skin go back to your guild and turn them in.  You will get the Burst of Flame scroll (DD spell that does 4 damage) this is very useful for pulling monsters.  Now, if you're level 2 (which you probably are) put 5 more points into Fishing.  And, if you have enough money, buy a Fishing Pole and several pieces of bait.  Fishing Poles cost around 2 gold 5 silver; bait costs 4 copper.  Now find a nice place to fish inside the town, since your skill level is 10 your fishing pole will rarely if ever break.  Using fishing I made enough money at level 2 to buy all my 1st level spells and had a lot left over.  It usually goes pretty quick a fish is worth 2 silver and you can also catch things like tattered cloth sandals (1.6 silver), rusty daggers (2.4 silver) and Fish Scales (4 copper).  After you have made quite a bit of money go buy as many spells you can of your level don't waste money on Endure Cold, it is useless to your level.  The 1st level buffs are very good (Dexterous Aura, Strengthen, and Inner Fire) always have them all on at all times.  Now its time to go back into Innothule and 'bash'.  Kobolds give good loot and experience mainly stick to them and of course kill decaying skeletons with weapons.  Don't waste time on 1st level creatures kobolds give 4 or 5 times better experience and a lot better loot.  At level 3 some Frogloks may con blue or white to you kill them of course as well as Froglok Tads and Decaying Skeletons.  Do NOT go to the Froglok islands near Guk, you will get swarmed and killed.<BR>
At level 4 you should go out by Guk, some Froglok Fishermen will con white so kill them and be near the wall at all times so you can run back to the Bashers when things get ugly.  At level 5 you get a new set of spells (you should have been saving up from the time you bought all your level 1 spells, which I think I forgot to mention).  I bought almost all except Endure Fire and Spirit Pouch (which I have no idea what does).  Now you can take most Fungus Man Trackers, Frogloks, Froglok Fishermen, Swamp Alligators, and some Froglok Foragers (don't go looking for these they are too far out but kill one if someone trained it to where you are hunting).  By now, if you havent found one on a decaying skeleton, you may want to procure a Two-Handed Blunt weapon of some sort, they do much more damage than One-Handed Blunt and the delay is worth it.  A worn great staff is usually a good choice and decaying skeletons drop these.<BR>
<BR>
Well until next time I feel like posting, good luck in your 'bashin'.<BR>

				Not only are these guys good I think they've got the best abilities and spells in the game. True a Wizard can wipe a hefty chunk of HP off of almost anyone near their lvl, they have nothing on the shamans as far as buffs, special trade skills (ALCHEMY), and HP.  You pit a shaman against a warrior of the same race,OGRE TROLL or the best BARBARIAN they will wipe the warriors ass for them with plenty of HP to spair.  Now pit a wizard against a warrior and if the wizard is lucky he'll last 10 melee's with HP in the 200's when they are lvl 15-20 (pathetic of most magic casters) they will surely die in minutes if not quicker.  Now a shaman's life is about up there with a warrior when they start out but then after like 5 lvl's a warrior will have like 10-20 HP more than a shaman and like 50-70 over main magic casters. It gets worse for the magic casters as they get bigger. At lvl 15 a warrior will have appr 450 HP and a shaman will have about 380 HP (unbuffed hehe), and a main magic caster will probably only boast 170-200, (unbuffed). But then that unbuffed issue is interesting, a magic caster class will be able to buff about 50-80 HP at lvl 15, while a shaman can put upwards of 180 HP and other stats like Dex + about 9 points. SHAMANS can heal up there with druids, not quite clerics, but they can increase their own and others' HP.  Now what does a wizard do hit a lot.  While shamans will hit for about 76 at lvl 14 the wizards i hear do about 90 at lvl 12.  This is not enough to even the advantages. Shamans help your brothers.  I have a wizard that is around lvl 11 and I don't have many friends because you can't heal people or even help them kill their creature (I usually end up stewaling the kill if I try to help!), but with my lvl 24 shaman I can heal buff almost any stat and cast SoW so people can escape if they wish.  I have a full friends list of people I see every day with my shaman and I need about 45 extra slots for all my cross-country buds and my wizard has only 5 of his own friends (I let him borrow some of my shaman friends |:-)   <BR>
<BR>
Over all I would say that a wizard is accepted in the world but a shaman is wanted, needed, and apprciated thoroughly<BR>
<BR>
Hope this has leaned you enough into deciding to be a shaman because we need more great people in this world!<BR>

				This is in response to rodricks comments about everfrost being hard to see at night, he is wrong. Everfrost is one of the easiest places in the game to see at night because it is all WHITE snow. I find it is better than any other infravision or not. The tundra on the other hand is very hard to see at night, but should not be ventured to until about lvl 5 or 6. By that time you should have a respectable light source.
