*THIS IS THE SPOILER TO THE FIERY AVENGER DO NOT READ BELOW IF YOU DONT WANT TO BE SPOILED!*

Anyway heres the exact post from the site :)

"The Quest for the Fiery Avenger?
MAJOR WARNING:  This quest was sent to me unsolicited and has not been verified in any way.  I am printing it belwo exactly as sent to me.  It is either acurate or a very impressive hoax, because the detail is amazing and enough of the information corresponds to items and quests which I can verify actually exist to make it seem valid.  If you do this, be aware that it will require a huge amount of time to complete as well aas the sacrifice of several highly sought after items such as Soulfire.  The reward is said to be the best sword in the game, which is wielded by Aradune yourself.  If you do it all and get nothing, just consider yourself forewarned. 

The following information is undisclosed. No you did not read it here; you did not read anything at all. 

Below is an account of the steps taken in order to acquire an elusive, highly prized sword. 

You will require extraordinary faction with the paladins of North Freeport, and with the paladins in Erudin. When considering an individual of either faction, "judges you amiably" will not suffice. You need to be one step above this, "smiles/considers you kindly/warmly".   In order to raise faction with the paladins of Erudin, you can acquire a quest to gather zombie skins. Slay zombie sailors in Erud's Crossing, harvest 4 flesh and return them for faction. 

Part 1: 

There is a high elf paladin in the Felwithe Paladin guild, in the basement that will reward you for completing the quest of returning Dvinn's Black Heart to him. There is a hidden quest here that he will not reveal to you unless you take the initiative. Slay Lord Grimrot in South Karana to earn "Lord Grimrot's Misshapen Heart". Trade this to the paladin and with appropriate faction, he will reveal to you that a former knight one quested after a "sword that purifies evil with fire". Take the note he gives to you and seek out the Drunk, a high elf, former knight it seems, wandering in Greater Faydark. Give him the note, which he reads, but decides not to give his information freely. The Drunk hands you a bottle, a two container slot, and requests an unusual drink before he "spills his secrets".  The first of two drinks is the "Tagglefoot Tingle Drink". This item is sometimes awarded by returning Runnyeye Warbeads to Rivervale in a side quest.  The second drink is created through Brewing. Find a craftsman to brew an Ogre Swill. The ingredients for this mix are a malt, yeast, froglock meat, and a cask. Combine the two drinks in the bottle, and return this to the Drunk. 

Part 2: 

The drunkard is impressed by the drink and unravels his tale. Apparently he once sought a "sword of fire", but inevitably gave up. He hands you an "Obsidian Key", and when you check your inventory, there is also a "Key Ring" present. He mentions that there are three keys he was after, but does not explain further, nor what the purpose of the keys is for. 

The second key is the "Shiny Brass Key". This item is found off the Ghoul Magi in Unrest. 

The third key is a bit more elusive. In the Abbey of the Muse in Ak'anon, city of gnomes, you will find the cleric AND rogue guilds. The rogue guild is behind an illusionary wall, and behind an additional hidden wall within this complex is a gnome rogue, a master locksmith. Hailing him he talks about a "skeleton key" that is rumored to open many kinds of locks. When you ask him about the key, he hints that a rogue carried this key, but drowned long ago with a sinking ship.  Venture to the Ocean of Tears. Directly north of the small island with the dinosaur, and slightly to the left (near the isle of aviaks), dive deep under the water and near the bottom is an alcove with a zombie sailor type.  Killing him you find find the key on his body, which is actually called the "Mythral Key". 

Combine the three keys in the "Key Ring", a 3 slot container, and create the "Key Set". 

Part 3: 

Venture to Erudin, to a chamber in one of the zones that constitutes the city. It is a long hallway with doors on both sides, one set of which leads to the bank. On the wall opposite the side with the "Bank of Erudin", enter the chamber and locate the illusionary wall.  What is surprising about this setup is that the lower half of the wall is an illusion and fake, but the upper half is real! If you simply walk into the wall you not be able to pass, but your feet will stick through the base of the wall. In order to pass through this obstacle, you must be of gnome size and crouch low, or as of a recent patch, have a Shaman cast the spell "Shrink" on you. When you pass through the wall, you will come to a lobby room of sorts, a cubical with a door before you. Hold the "Key Set" with the mouse cursor and click on the door. The door will unlock and allow you to enter.  Inside is a study room of sorts, but also a living space and inside a human paladin in chain armor (not plate like the guild knights in Freeport and Qeynos). 

Hail the man and he mentions two things. He asks for his keys to the chamber that he lost (ignore this for now), or you can ask him who he is.  Apparently he is a former knight, seeking sanction in Erudin from the oppresive world. He is a bit curious/suspicious of your presence and requests/demands that you prove your worth.  He hands you a small bag, with four container slots. The knight says that the "spawn of the burning prince" must be stopped, and his skin brought back as proof of his demise. The Burning Prince is the name of Solusek Ro, god of fire, and the spawn is none other than Lord Nagafen.  You are required to obtain not one, but three red dragon scales off the wyrm. "Red Dragon Scales" is a moderately uncommon treasure item on the beast. Zero to as many as three (rarely) can be found on any one of his corpses. You will most likely have to slay the dragon three of four times to 
acquire an adequate supply.  The fourth item to be placed in the bag is a hammer. The reclusive paladin mentions a magic hammer to forge a blade like none other. The hammer he speaks of is the "Thex Mallet", which is involved or referred to in at least two other quests, or can be used as a weapon after obtaining it.  To acquire the Mallet, slay the Elf Skeleton behind the third locked door in Befallen. He drops either the "Head" or "Hilt", so kill the undead several times to get both pieces.  Also on the third floor is Commander Windstream, a level 20 or so zombie. He carries the "stem", a two slot container in which you place both mallet pieces. Combine and create the hammer.  Place the dragon scales and mallet into the bag and return to Erudin to the hermit. 

Part 4: 

Hand the combined quest items to the knight. When you hail the knight now, he does mention "returning his keys", or "proving your worth". Instead he presents a different option.  He mentions "supplies". Upon questioning his further, he hands you a piece of paper, a "list" of sorts, with various blacksmithing components noted, such as sheet of metal, ore, etc. Keep the list and gather the blacksmithing craft items. You will need to find a blacksmith to forge you some pieces. It is important to hail him along two different quest lines, in order to obtain both the list, and the backpack to combine all the smithing supplies.  (Similar to the Ice Comet quest in which you get both a book and the wheel container, but separately).  Return the backpack to the knight and he will tell you to return at sunrise, in one day's time. At this point he poofs. 

Note: The knight will return to the room at 6am. Use the /time command to keep track. However it is important to realize that twenty four hours must have also passed in order for the room to be occupied once again.  Example: If you returned the blacksmithing backpack to him at 11pm, he will not be there at 6am because only seven hours passed, so an extra day must pass. However if you return the supplies to him at 5am, you will only have to wait 25 hours. 

Part 5: 

The following morning, the knight will be back in the room, available for passers-by to initiate the quest. Hailing him he requests the return of his keys, or proving your worth, just as before. This time return the keys which you should have kept up until now. He thanks you, and on the side, asks if you have seen his list. You should still have the list of supplies as well. By giving him the list, you open up the next part of the quest.  He says that while you were gone, he had the Deepwater Knights forge a sword in reward for your heroism and courage, using the supplies and magical properties of the dragon scales. That is no doubt where the need for the mallet came into play. In any case, you are awarded a "Forged Deepwater Blade".  [Forged Deepwater Blade Dmg: 18 Dly: 40 Class: Paladin]  Venture to North Freeport, where the Paladin Guild of the Marr twins can be found. Find the guild master of the guild, the one that a level 1 paladin human would present his guild note to. Hailing him will not present any recognition of the journey you have completed so far.   At this point, you must have the "Soulfire". This holy sword is a prequisite for the last and final phase of this quest. In the trade window with the paladin knight, place both the Soulfire AND the Forged Deepwater Blade. If one OR the other is placed in the window alone, he will simply say "thank you", and your sword will vanish. Killing the knight will not get the sword(s) back from his corpse.  You gain experience upon delivering both swords. Your additional reward is a scroll, as the knight speaks of a "flaming sword" to champion justice.  The "Forged Deepwater Blade" will be found in your inventory once again (placed their automatically), but the "Soulfire" is sacrificed at this stage.  Take the blade and the scroll and consult the leader of the Cleric guild in North Freeport, the temple of Marr. Hand the sealed scroll (you cannot read its contents) to the guild master, who casts some form of blessing/spell upon you. No effect will be readily noticeable, but upon searching your inventory:  The "Forged Deepwater Blade" of the Deepwater Knights of Erudin is replaced/transformed into a/the Fiery Avenger.

This sword is not an artifact, but the quest is long and involved, demanding the pursuit of not just the deepwater blade, but the Soulfire as well. "

				Has anyone actually tried any of this? Or to see if any of this stuff exists? About the drunk, yeah he has a quest for his daughters.. but not all npc's are just for a single quest. It is possible that by giving him the note, it initiates the other quest line. If anyone has and real evidence that any of this is true, please post. Btw... im pretty sure that you cannot, no how, no way cast shrink without being in a dungeon. But if that wall exists as he says, I know a way that I might be able to get in. I will venture forth to see if this even exists. <BR>
..and so the quest for fire contiues.........<BR>

				Wow, some people really have toooo much time. To write such a long quest just for nothing....<BR>
Im only lvl 17, but I sure its a hoax, cause <BR>
1) it has 33dmg 33dly.... better than swords found on Cazic Thule??? and 2) If someone knows the whole quest someone should have it, right? But i never heard of someone who has it.<BR>
BTW, if Aradune has one it doesnt mean anything, if Aradune wants to have a sword with 5000dmg 2dly, he can create one, or let others create it for him :) . But nice Story anyway(i hope the quest is a hoax in the early parts, too. I hope nobody can really do a quest like this, maybe some parts are in the game, until the point with the Soulfire...the person would really do something very BAD if he gives it away for nothing.)  <BR>

There is *no* second secret door in the rogue's guild in Ak'Anon - I checked this after readin' this crock in the vain hope that me Guildsmaster's 'ad learned ta talk in me absence.  No dice.  No phantom rogue locksmith, either.<BR>

Save yer energy.  I hope someday the gnome rogues (and clerics) will get some quests of our own, but I ain't holdin' me breath.<BR>

				I don't have much time right now so I skimmed through it but if I'm right, I didn't see anything involving all the Gods.  I read that soemone said that Aradune told him that this quest involves all the Gods, sort of throwing him a bone on the quest but that was all.  Of course, he may be lying, also.
