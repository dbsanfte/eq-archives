</FONT><HR>The only main bad thing about being a wizard really is the res. cap right now. Rather then that I love my wizard. I am able to solo anything that con's white or blue, and most things that con yellow, and even a few reds. I never have problems finding a group and I just always enjoyed playing a Wizard. I think most people's problems have to do with how they play wizards. Wizards aren't supposed to be easy to play. But if you play them right, at least so far as I have seen, they can run with <beat> any other class hands down !!! To back this up, I am soloing in unrest right now. I fight in the house on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd floors and can take almost any baddy that spawns except hags, a few barbed, most GDB's, and a very few werebats one on one every time. And this is fighting in the house alone. And as far as grouping, people love to group with a well played wizard, and I say this because I get invites everyday asking me to join the group camping the knight room, or the group camping the balcony. Now this group is ussaly on average about 3 to 5 levels higher then me, but they ask for me when they have an open slot over other people because I know how to use my wizard and I am a good plus for the group and they know it. So in sum things up, LEARN TO PLAY YOUR CLASS or choose a class that is easy to play. I have died at least 200 times learning to play my wizard, but the key is I LEARNED. Now the only time I die is when I know I am getting in over my head, but I want to try it anyway for the challenge or the fun of things. Or I am saving some tanks ass because I don't want to have to wait for him to run back from the bind point and he needs to zone.<BR>Now I know I am going to get flamed hard for this post. I am just curious if any other wizard actually has fun and makes there class work or has people impress by what they can do as a wizard.<P>Zothen Runecaster<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=5&topic=000090.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=Wizard|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Are+there+any+good+wizards+in+EQ+|QUS||QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>I agree with everything said hre. I love playing my Wizard, frankly i can't stand anything else. I've heard comments like "u guys rock" and "gee u guys are awesome" etc etc. from ppl i bailed out of SERIOUS TROUBLE who were a couple of levels higher than me. For example i was only 12th lvl when i saved the butt of a 16th lvl Bard. The guy was so impressed he asked me to group with him! Now at lvl 14 i reckon we rock even badder. I don't go up to the big bad uglies and slog it out with them, if i did i'd cark it pretty quick. The wizards work is artistry, we to MEGA dmg from a distance and we are AWESOME at getting others out of trouble. Were probably THE BEST trouble shooters in Norrath. Combine us in a group with a healer and there is a group that is absolutely awe inspiring.<BR>Also i like the fact that wizzies are hard to play. So they should be!<BR>As for pets, i don't want one. I'd much rather have the ability to travel far and wide (i conceed at a much higher level than what i am now) although that is something to look forward to.<BR>I can go on like this for ages but to cut a very long story short, i wish ppl would top whining regarding Wizards. They arethe ones who don't have the patience,tenacity or ability to be a decent wizard so they shoud switch to something that suits their personality more.<BR>Have lots of fun blowing me to pieces, yours truly <P>Fabo<BR>14th circle wizard<BR>Quellious server :=))))</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=5&topic=000090.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=Wizard|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Are+there+any+good+wizards+in+EQ+|QUS||QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>This is all very sad.<BR>It is true that wizards are extremely slighted. I've read all the replies (and new topics) I could, and now I will compile all the complaints I can think of.<P>-The spell cap, though it is NOT EXACTLY 5 LEVELS ABOVE still inhibits us tremendously.<P>-Magicians can match us in most ways and also get pets, though we can cast slightly faster than them and get more damage at higher levels.<P>-I read in the Gamezboard forums that a lvl 50 enchanter sucessfully killed a lvl 50 wizard in a deul. Upon starting the enchanter, you are given a message telling you the difficulty of the character choice, and it is lower than that of a wizard. By all rights we should eventually be better.<P>-Everyone had too great expectations.<BR>one-Your decision/motivation to become/stay a wizard was based largly off Ice Comet.<BR>two-You read books that have great wizards in them and they are always the best.<BR>three-you wanted a challenge and you new wizards were very griped-about so you wanted to see how hard it was.<P>Now I believe I can change everyone's mind with the next thing I have to say.<P>Wizards have and always will have the most powerfull Direct Damage spells. The Expansion pack will allow for you to gain to about lvl 75 instead of the current accepted cap of 50. There will be a multitude of shiny new spells that will leave magicians in a cloud of dust when it comes to damage. Sure, magicians will get new spells, but they have always been seen as summoners and will probaly get new pets and be able to summon more things. Ice Comet is just the begining.<P>The second thing I have to say is that we are the masters of self and group teleportation and probably will always stay at the top of that too. I can reasonable forsee a spell that allows you to actually select the location you wish to be teleported to.<P>The third and FINAL>: ; WE ARE THE MASTERS OF THE PLANES. I seriously doubt that any other class will gain access to the planes. As long as a party want to go to the planes they NEED a wizard to take them there. And if they take him there and then disband him out (which they probably wouldn't) the wizard could leave them on the plane to rot.<P>I know many of you will now say, "But I want it now! I can't wait till level 75 to have power!". Then I say to you: Hang up your green cloak, erase your spell book and become a Magician YOU %*$^# TRAITOR! MAY INNORUK ROAST YOU FOR ALL ETERNITY!!! Sorry, got a little carried away in my role playing. I was saying, we will get a lot more benefits and the distinction will widen, leaving us far ahead of magicians in some areas while, I'll admit, they will be ahead of us in others.<BR>With enchanters, I don't know, because they seem really cool, too. Of course we will leave them behind on DD and warp spells, but woe the day a wizard challenges an enchanter to a deul and doesn't see that they have Lord Nagafen as a PET.<P>This is a culmination of all the woes of the wizard, and how it is thought we will be freed of them. If you would like to add to my comprehensive guide, go right ahead.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=5&topic=000090.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=Wizard|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=Are+there+any+good+wizards+in+EQ+|QUS||QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana"><A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum5&number=5&thisthread=000090&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum5&number=5&thisthread=000090&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
