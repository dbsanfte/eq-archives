I have only recently begun experimenting with the class and I have met with many grumbles and gripes from players whom I did not heal or buff at a moments notice...Is this normal? Or have a just run afoul of some misguided individuals?<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Arakiel72</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">I wouldnt say its required of you, especially not if your arent grouped with them.  However, it's better roleplaying to play the kind, giving, priestly sort of cleric who would do such things.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">DIERA</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">I THINK IF THEY ASK FOR HEALING OR BUFFING THEY SHOULD PAY FOR IT I DO IF I ASK FOR A BUFF OR HEAL I TRY TO OFFER MONEY FOR THEIR TIME  I KNOW I HATE WHEN I HAVE TO SIT THERE TO HEAL GETTING MANA BACK IS JUST THE SAME IF YOU SEE THIS  OFFER MONEY OR SOMETHING TO THEM IF YOU WANT IT IT IS FAIR HE HAD TO PAY FOR THE SPELL AND HAS TO SIT THERE WHEN YOU GO BACK TO FIGHT <P><BR>DIERA <BR>QUEEN OF BLACKBURROW <BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">DIERA</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">sorry i wasn't looking when i typed didn't see caps on heheeheh</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">uh</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">The way I've seen people do it is clerics are generally nice people who buff and anything else without expected payment, but say something to the effect of "Donations to the church are always welcome". Good RPers will always donate if they aren't short on funds. This is effective, I've seen my friend the shaman earn a platinum in about 15 minutes off of donations for casting Spirit of Wolf.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">deira</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">uh is right ask for donation is a good way some people are rude though i know 2 people who have money and when they ask for stuff and people give it to them they never pay up that is sad but i think it has to do with there ages they act young so you have to know that some younger kids will be alittle cheap hehe</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Aydo</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">I am not a Cleric, Im a druid but I think to some extent the same question applies...<P>And I wanted to say "Hi" to Fargo who I met in Freeport (if I remember rightly) but haven't seen since.<P>My opinion is this:<P>You don't have to roleplay a kindly wise cleric to roleplay a cleric, that's oversimplistic and I 'd argue against the statement that it is "better". <P>But even if you are kindly and wise, you don't have an obligation to buff any sword-brained idiot who demands it, any more than they have an obligation to rescue you if you get in melee and shout for help.<BR>Its down to individuals either<P>a) out of character being helpful, returning a favour, or responding to bribery or simple politeness<P>or b) in character, behaving as they feel _their own personal character_ would, not how they feel a stereotype of a priest would.<P>If you play your character consistently people will come to know your name and react accordingly; if you just give out a standard buff/heal/response to every hail, you might as well be an NPC.<P>Just my 2pence worth.<p>[This message has been edited by Aydo (edited 08-19-1999).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Skeeve</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">When I was a cleric initially (before I got meditate) I could never buff or heal anyone as I was constantly saving my sps. When I got meditate, and worried less about the sps, I started buffing and healing. The main difference I noticed was that you make a LOT more friends as a healer. You may get bored while soloing because you can't take out much, but as a healer people will, after you have healed, buffed or cured them, be asking you constantly to group with them. They will also be constantly asking you for more heals though, but be kind... I know that I would lend any amount of money to my cleric friends, the number of times they saved my hide from poison, or trains.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Elindil</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Here is my take. Priests follow the path of their diety in how they react to people. I always charge evil races up front before I cure or bind, no exceptions. but that is my character. As far as the healing and buffing and curing and binding goes, it is simple, If i have mana and myself or my group are not low on health or without buffs, not a problem. My first priority is always to my group!! I personally never charge for any spells that I cast (except Darkies) If someone offers me money I never turn it down, I thank them and tell them this will go towards purchase of greater spells that I may use on them again one day, but I never ask.<P>That is take on it</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Fletcher</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">This is a little late for a reply but I have some input. If I was a doctor and someone came running up to me after a big shootout in the street saying "Heal me it's your job so I can go back out fighting." I would tell them to get lost. If I was a priest, only my religion would dictate my reaction. How far do you want to roleplay. I have a suggestion<BR>: require them to listen to your sermon before healing. They will run away fast. I once heard a dwarf priest ridicule a poisoned elf until he died for being rude. It was great fun to see him toast the spirit into the next life.<P>Fletcher</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Falon</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">If you respond to every hail and request for heals and buffs and give them for free, some people may start to seek you out for these free spells more often.  I'm sure it can get quite overwhelming to try to keep up the requests sometimes.  If you're healing and buffing for free, then you're paying to play a game so that other people can advance their characters while you sit around and meditate.  If this is what you enjoy, then by all means, do so!  I'm sure that lots of people will thank you for it, myself included.  That's the point of view from a power leveling, non-role playing perspective.  If you want to make money and have time to advance your character, then charge a flat fee or ask for donations.<P>I am not, however, saying that I advocate this.  It's your character, you paid for it...play it how you choose.  Do whatever is the most fun for you.  Role playing can be an absolute blast.  I would have LOVED to have been there to see that dwarf taunt the rude little elf.  I'm sure you can have quite a lot of fun playing the wandering healer.  I really like that idea of preaching to those wanting healing before you will cast on them.  It probably would work as a rather good deterent for too many people wanting spells cast on them.  Instead of saying the standard 'donations accepted' you could try to come up with some other way of making it known that you would accept cash in return for your time and effort.  Emote that you rattle the donation box or something.  <P>Personally, I always at least offer to pay when I have people cast spells on me and I have cash on hand.  More than half the time my offers are refused and I get the spells for free.  I also cast what buffs I can on the person who cast theirs on me.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Paladin</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">OOC<P>I typically will heal freely when I am able to.  If I am in a group I heal others before tending to my wounds.  However, as many have mentioned, it is completely up to you.  From an RP point-why should I charge something that my god gives to me freely to help others?<P>One thing I have seen is that most folks will donate for buffs (ie sow etc) but very few offer any payment for healing (I have been offered payment, but typically just ask for them to help another in a time of need).  Is this being taken for granted?  I am not sure, maybe folks view them as distinct and separate.<P>I know many who buff/heal for no charge, especially so for young characters (yay for those kind folk!).  The only time I have flatly refused to heal someone is when they wanted me to help them powerlevel by healing them as they fought creatures that out classed them.<P>One policy that seems to work:<BR>If you have the mana and feel charitable heal others without them asking.<P>If someone asks for a heal, well then its up to you isn't it =)<P>Paladin of Underfoot</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">loozar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">well i'm a ranger and the little bit of healing ability i have, i freely use it on people in need.  i've depleted my mana many of time in the newbie zone only to find that i should have saved it for myself.  i solicit clerics and druids to cure my diseases often and the ones that repeatedly help me, i usually return the favor with a majic item.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Evilsbane</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Coming from 16 years of Catholic Education, I can tell you that there is a lot of variation in the character and personalities of priests: gruff to tender, taciturn to loquacious, pious to rakish, generous to stingy, etc.  And these are all of the same denomination of the same religion.<P>My opinion is you should roleplay your character's take on how to serve his/her diety.  Maybe you freely help co-religionists, but anyone else has to pay. Maybe you won;t help those of other races.  Maybe you make only co-religinists pay.  you get to decide.  Then you can discuss this with other clerics of your own deity and try to get some consensus -- even start an Order!<P>My shaman character freely heals other barbs, especially the young warriors and is always good for a SOW for a higher level barb going after a corpse.  However, he only helps Outlanders he feels to be particularly deserving.  And when he gets scolded for not helping strangers, he can get pretty shirty and haughty in return.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></td></tr></table>
