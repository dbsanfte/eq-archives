			A correction to an earlier post, the effect is Mana Sink (much like the Enchanter spell Mana Seive) and it does NOT transfer the mana to the wielder, it just disappears from the target. The effect drains ~150-200 mana, when the effect goes off it says &quot;(target) winces&quot; and there is no spell effect (i.e. no pretty colors, you just have to look for the winces message to see if it procs.)

			I tracked this staff wielding lizard for a very high level shaman one night, and was rewarded for my efforts with a beautiful white wolf cloak. He was running (faster than I with SoW) past the inn, and had a pet in tow. We finally ran him down at the gypsies, but was a heck of a fight. Good luck getting him to go down!<BR>

			While hunting HG's our ranger got this lizzie on track and we took a look.  Our party of five took him down without our wizard who got lost on the way to the battle and it was one hell of a fight.  There's a screen shot of the fight on Bilge Hunter.<BR>
<BR>
As for cost, I was offered 10KPP immediately by somone in the area who had a high level shaman I have been offered even more since then including any droppable item I wanted plus plat and I will not give this staff up for anything.<BR>
<BR>
As for the mana sink effect, there is no visible proc as noted in an earlier post, it merely says that the target winces.  If there is a transfer of mana I have never noticed it.  I wish there was as this would take this from an incredible weapon to pretty much the ultimate non-planar/dragon gear out there.<BR>
<BR>
Do not attempt to solo this lizzie, I would estimate it at a minimum of 39th and possibly higher and between it's pet and it's fighting ability a solo character is gonna die unless you're very very good.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks again to my group, hunt well, live bravely...<BR>

			Just today me and a couple friends got this staff.  A druid in our guild noticed him being up while hunting hill giants, she tried to kill him but died (lev 33 druid). So she called in the guns :)  . Me, a level 47 shaman, and a level 47 druid got there fast and we had no trouble at all taking him out.  The staff is great and we gave it to our shaman, he loves it.  It is truly massive when held by an ogre.  In regards to anyone looking for him, we found him on the rock near the giant area where all the mobs get stuck.  Good luck getting him.

			Let me tell you how i got my Mortificators staff tonight. While completley lost in Rathe mtns I stumbled across a guild member who is also a shaman. We chatted for a bit when he says to me &quot;HOLD&quot;. I'm like what? I turn around and not more than 20yrds from us is good old Mort. Im 35 along with my buddy and he conned red. Im guessing hes 38ish. Standing there stunned we were afraid to attack him cause he was red and had a pet(necros are never any fun). Next thing I know someone starts blasting it, so I start blasting and was connecting on him for full DD of 253pts and he went down quick. I didn't get the kill but of all the luck in the world the guy who got the kill was very a old friend of mine and he rushed up and slammed the staff into the trade window and gave it to me. Woohoo. For about the next 20minutes i was stunned. I dreamed about this wep, but never thought it would be realistic to actually camp him since he is so rare. I was using OB staff and was doing about 32pts max damage with it. Now with the mort im cranking for 42pts of damage every once in awhile. The effect Mana Sink procs more often than you would think. Typically 2 or 3 times during a good melee fight. The staff looks HUGE in my barbarian hands.I have no intentions of trading it for anything, even a spiritualist hammer or a withered. I actually had a guy want to trade me his withered staff for it to give you a idea how sought after it is. Since I'm on rallos zek this staff will come in very handy against those naked erudite wizards. Damn now i cant get any sleep since im so stoked :)

			WOO HOO! I got my Morti staff today :) camped the dumb lizzie for 5 days, found out on the 5th day that he had spawned while i was sleeping on the 2nd day :( but i said oh well and kept on exterminating lizards everywhere and wouldnt you know it not 2 hrs later there he was, my ranger friend picked up on him and we were off! But a lvl 45 druid and wizzie got the kill :( but they gave me the staff since i'd been there for 5 days looking for this guy and by then everyone knew that....so YAY ME! I love it and it is interesting he spawned again after 3 days and it wasnt a whole week, i had doubted that number in the 1st place ( i mean who sits around for an entire week waiting for one spawn over and over?)but good luck to anyone else who wants to try it, i did feel as though i was going to lose my sanity on several occasions but the staff is definatly worth it :)
