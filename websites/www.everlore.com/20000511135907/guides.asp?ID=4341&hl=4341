<!--<tr><td><font face="verdana">	i suggest you start with at least 10 skill in pottery. i started with 9. I was in halas when i decided to do pottery. when you first enter halas there are 2 merchants by the gate...one of them is named Sconi or something in that direction...she sells the sketches need for pottery. next you shall need to go to the cigar shop. when you first enter it the woman to the left will sell you clay, firing sheets, and glass shards which are all crucial componets. I will list the directions for different items later in the guide.
	
	The first thing you should make are small jars, i think you can make this to about 20-25 of skill then it becomes trivial, then move on to medium jars til you get to about 40 in skill. Now you make large bowls til 50. This is were you make a lot of money...at 50 skill you'll be able to make pie tins to the point where the return is greater than your loss. Pie Tins sell for 5-6 gold depending on your charisma. Do not bother with other things like deities or skewers or anything else...waste of money and some things like deities does not work yet...look for that in a later patch. Pie tins will get you all the to master in pottery and you can make well over 200 plat in about 3-5 days depending on how fast you work, i made master in 3 days. The reason pottery is not a favorite among most people is that the clay is not stackable and neither are the firing sheets, the sketches are and so is the water. It does get annoying digging through a bunch of backpacks but you need patience for this trade.

	ok, here we go...these are the materials used for pottery- small block of clay, block of clay, large block of clay, quality firing sheet, firing sheet, high quality firing sheet, and glass shards. 

*very important*- always remember to include a flask of water when you use the pottery wheel, i forgot a couple times*  

Small Jar- block of clay + small jar sketch + flask of water- these are placed in pottery wheel. then if you are successful you will need a quality firing sheet. when you are in the Golden Torch there is a  door leading to a backyard...the Kiln is out there and when you get to it place the product you got from the wheel and place the quality firing sheet in as well and then hit combine...if you make it you get a small clay container that holds two things.

that was a recipe as well as an example as to how you create things...i will now list the medium jar, large bowl and pie tin.

Medium Jar- block of clay, medium jar sketch, flask of water, quality firing sheet
Large Bowl- large block of clay, large bowl sketch, flask of water, glass shard
Pie Tin- 2 blocks of clay, pie tin sketch, flask of water, high quality firing sheet

*by the way...Halas is the best town to get started in pottery with, the whole town is one zone and everything you need is 15 seconds apart in 2 different shops which are accross from each other. and i only spent 14 plat raising it to master!*

Good Luck to all of you with Pottery
