				   Perhaps the reason there's so little information here on Clerics is they are pretty straightforward conversions from D&amp;D.  <BR>
   Clerics can wear plate mail, use any blunt weapon, have hitpoints somewhere between a warrior and a wizard, and cast the most powerful healing spells.<BR>
   Clerics are extremely good beginning classes as their ability to heal themselves and others means very little sitting time between experience earning.  If you compare the /who list for clerics of varying levels you will often find far more clerics at higher levels than you will at low levels.  For most classes it's the other way around.  (Although I have not seen it first hand, it stands to reason that there's so many more higher level Clerics than lower level ones that there is a bit of a surplus in Clerics when you get higher up, so you may find it harder to get a group).<BR>
     Clerics do not seem to suffer any experience handicaps as they are not considered a hybrid as Paladins are despite their ability to wear armor as well as use weapons.  However, this does not come entirely cost-free, as Clerics receive their spells slower than straight spellcasting classes as a consiquence.<BR>
    Clerics get some dreadfully powerful spells quite early.  Divine Aura takes a very long time to recycle between castings but makes the Cleric temporarily unable to attack or be attacked - this gives them a nice ability to escape a combat gone bad.  The Courage spell keeps raising in potency as the cleric gains levels so that a Level 20 cleric who casts Courage on a Level 3 character would probably give them several times their normal HP and AC.<BR>
    While Clerics were may never have been intended to be direct casting combat mages, against undead they are able to inflict damage that would make a wizard envious, while still possessing the ability to wear the best armor and use nice weapons.  This makes them excellent soloers and, because of their ability to heal, they have minimal difficulty finding a group.<BR>
    When you get right down to it, the only thing the Cleric really lacks is originality, in two ways:  First, their spellbooks are rather boring as they contain mostly healing and boosting spells.  You can consider yourself lucky you have of you get an attack spell every spell rank as a Cleric.  Secondly, so many people tend to play them as Cleric levels probably shoot up faster than any other class and they are very secure due to their being able to heal themselves or cast divine aura if things go wrong.<BR>
   These advantages are nice and all, but have caused more than one cleric has complained of being bored.

				Clerics may be boring but is indispensible. They make a great solo character because of their reasonable fighting fighting skills. Clerics can tank if needed but are the ultimate auxiliary class. The major drawback is that not only must the cleric buy spells but also armor in which they are not restricted. I recomend acquiring a mace as soon as possible along with a shield. A staff is ok if nothing else is around. Light heal, holy armor and ward undead are the most useful spells at the early stages (1-8). A good cleric always keeps an eye on the hit points of the other group members during a fray and casts healing spells throughout the combat. This assures the fighters that you are watching and won't let them get too low so they can fight on. Always remember to buff the other party members before combat. This is a big help. Clerics are always welcome in a group, so be gracious and helpful even if you aren't grouped. Good acts tend to be remembered and reciprocated.

				Clerics are the ultimate high-level group members.  Soloing is easy until about 20th level, when blues are starting to really hit hard.<BR>
The best advice for beginning clerics is to find some banded mail early on from another player.  A mace, morning star or other good one handed weapon and a shield are very helpful when soloing (can't have too much ac!).<BR>
For spells - divine aura WILL save your life and others' if you use it correctly.  It's best not to depend on it, as it takes so bloody long to recharge, but if you and your group are being swarmed, it has the effect of an anti-taunt, being that the creatures will often ignore you so you can start healing.<BR>
The stun spell early on is basically useless - 2 seconds of stun isn't going to help you.  Courage is irreplaceable, as are all of the following spells (center, daring, bravery, etc.).<BR>
Strike, furor, smite, wrath etc. are great spells, but very mana inefficient.  They're nice if something is running, or if you're soloing, but don't use them much in combat with a group of more than a few people, save your mana for heals.<BR>
<BR>
By 15th level or so, you should have at least close to a full set of banded and your 14th level spells (nice ones!  Healing, etc.).  Try to find a nice 1h or 2h magical weapon (like a runed totem staff, or JOY! a glowing crook staff).<BR>
Buy whatever resistance spells you can get.<BR>
<BR>
My best advice really is to find a group to &quot;grow up&quot; with.  People you like, who play the same times that you do, and especially who you trust.  This can be difficult, but if you start early you're much better off than a 30th level cleric who has to bounce around from group to group.<BR>
<BR>
When you hit 19th, definitely buy Holy Might.  It only does about 30 points of damage, but the stun is worth the mana.  It has an 18 second stun, I believe, and this can mean the difference between saving someone's life with a heal when a critter is beating on you.<BR>
<BR>
I recommend buying Hammer of Wrath if you aren't able to lay your hands on a better magical weapon, but DO NOT bother buying Hammer of Striking at 24th.  It's a truly pathetic weapon, and hardly better than the hammer of wrath.<BR>
<BR>
Otherwise, be a good cleric.  Heal people you don't know who are getting whooped in battle, and NEVER charge for things like curing disease.  It's unclericly, and pretty much downright rude.  Making friends is a cleric's forte'.<BR>
<BR>
You will obviously have a distinct advantage over everyone else with undead.  Even necromancers won't get your spells at the same levels, so keep that in mind.  Soloing a giant skeleton who is 3 or 4 levels higher than you is a possibility once you have dismiss undead (which does about 140 points of direct damage).<BR>
<BR>
Okay, I rambled :)  - Main points:<BR>
Find a good group that you like and STAY WITH THEM.<BR>
Only buy spells that will be useful (things like calm/lull, stun, and hammer of striking are worthless)<BR>
Heal people you don't know who need it.  You never know when the favour will be repaid.<BR>
Do some serious holy butt-kicking on any and all undead you can get your hands on.<BR>
And don't forget!  A cleric's job is to save lives.  Sometimes it means you go down with the ship, but do everything you can to save your group and yourself.<BR>

				Lull the first lvl spell is quite useless, but soothe works grand.  If you have never played an enchanter or bard, well then the cleric line of spells of lull seems useless, but in fact are such a major help, it's just one more thing a cleric has to burn mana on.  Sure you'll be an ok, maybe considered competent cleric if all you do is buff and heal, but that is BORING.  And soloing wise, sure we can solo, but after the low teens it's kind of hard to find an undead alone which you can use ward on.  Sure we could probably burn them all down to nothing, but in micro dungeons like Unrest, or dungeon settings like Befallen, the mobs will all go agro on you if you are just trying to whack on one of them, which presents a lot of problems for casting.  Finally, like any priest class we need the least experience to advance, one reason you will see many higher lvl clerics faster than any other class is the plain fact that they lvl faster than any other.  So to put that into prospective, if you play as much as another person don't be afraid to just cast heals and let yourself die to get them to the zone border, as you'll probably catch up and beat them in lvls almost no problem, especially compared to a hybrid, like a bard.  Finally, to use the soothe line (I say soothe, because lull 1st lvl is resisted way too much by even blues) just target the blues or greens you don't want to come running to help, and pull the mob you want out of the camp while they are all broken for the help link to fight just one.  Repeat as necessary in a multiple mob camp.  This makes it so we are useful before with soothe and buffs, and after/during combat with heals, and makes it so life isn't sooo boring.

				This is DEFINATELY getting on my nerves, all this &quot;Clerics are boring&quot; BS. Clerics are fun and worht it. They get the fun experience of smashing stuff into the ground, OK buffs, great heals, and mediocre Evocation (great Evok. vs. Undead). All throughout the above info, everyone has underrated Strike, Furor, etc. It does as much damage as a Wizard DD spell, and while it takes up a lot of mana, THAT'S NOT THE POINT! Buff yourself, get up full mana, and use your really good blunt weapons to beat your foe into a pulp while blasting him with Furor. One more thing that was not touched on here. At early levels, up to about 10, CLERICS ARE THE BEST PvP. The little-used spell called &quot;Flash of Light&quot; makes your opponents screen go COMPLETELY black, so while they are stumbling around, you can beat on them with staff and spell. And at lvl 9, Clerics get Root, so they can freeze, blind, and then batter. AND on top of all this, Clerics get some of the coolest summoning spells. Hammer of Wrath, Summon Food, and Summon Drink. A lot of classes get food and drink, but it is still QUITE advantageous since from level 9 on, you need not buy food or water again.

				Here is a Top Ten list of CLERIC issues.<BR>
<BR>
(Please read it through before you comment)<BR>
<BR>
1. BLUNT WEAPONS. Our weapons are ok till about level 20. From then on, cleric weapons are worse than any class in the game. When a gnome enchanter is outdamaging you in melee you know something is wrong. Which leads to the next issue.<BR>
<BR>
2. CLERIC-Specific items. It seems every class in the game has thier own items. Be it armor, shields, or weapons... something to make them more individual. Even though my friends Bloodforge has a better ratio, he still uses his Wee Harvester just because its a druid only 2h Blunt... Im not asking for superweapons or super-armor... just something to aspire for. Which leads to issue 3.<BR>
<BR>
3. QUESTS! Have any of you heard of that great cleric quest?? Dont know<BR>
which one I mean??? THATS BECAUSE THERE ARE NONE!!! Our quests are few<BR>
and far betweeen and all of which are useless or broken. When all my<BR>
friends are out doing quests, I have to settle for making the old Bloodforge run, just to keep myself busy. Verant... throw us a bone man.. every class needs decent class-specific quests to keep us<BR>
interested. This is a reasonable request man. Hell... even if they made you do a quest in order to get a normal spell like WRATH it would make me happy. I have yet to ever hear a cleric tell me about a good quest they did. Everquest or Neverquest??<BR>
<BR>
4. DIRECT DAMAGE. We all loved Smite at lvl 14, but GOD ALMIGHTY we have<BR>
to wait 15 more levels for a new Direct Damage??? One problem is not<BR>
only the bad damage ratio but also the fact that they have a really long recast delay. The Worst problem by far is that they are SO few and far between.  There are levels where HYBRIDS can do more damage than we<BR>
can!! ask a level 28 cleric about his direct damage and he will laugh (though probably cry ) . A ranger or shadowknight will outdamage him at<BR>
that level.<BR>
<BR>
5. SUMMONED HAMMERS. Now everyone knows the Hammer of Wrath is a decent enough weapon for its level. Not great... but decent. But the next two hammers just seem like a mistake. They are completely useless at those levels required to summon them. Come on Verant... you can kill two birds with one stone by making the summoned hammers decent weapons that SOME people would consider USING!! At this point, the way they are now, I'd say about 0.01% of clerics actually use their summoned hammers after hammer of wrath.<BR>
<BR>
6. SUMMON FOOD &amp; DRINK. Is there really any legitimate reason why we<BR>
must wait so damn long to get the Plentiful Food and Drink spells? What it does is make us just forget about summoning food and drink after 20th level or so. &quot;Ah.. might as well buy it. not worth the time to summon it... &quot;<BR>
<BR>
7. INVIGOR spells. Does anyone ever use these? Ever? Its not as though<BR>
they buff your Stamina stat like a shaman can. Wow... they restore<BR>
fatigue. ooooh. I have yet to ever memorize one of these line of spells. and have yet to ever meet a cleric who cast it.  Who ever has the extra mana to spend in a battle on restoring ones stamina?<BR>
<BR>
8. YAULP. Why do we even get these spells??? These are good for<BR>
paladins, but we clerics are obviously a GROUP CLASS, so this minor upgrade spell should be area effect buff. Only then would i really consider keeping this line of spells memmed. Otherwise it stays in my book unmemmed forever.<BR>
<BR>
9. RESURRECT. How in the world did we let Verant get away with this<BR>
guys??? They reduced the death XP penalty by a whopping 50% but did not reduce the tremendous amount of MANA required by clerics to cast these spells? How is that justifiable I might ask???<BR>
<BR>
10. TRAVEL. I hate the fact that all these hybrids and casters get<BR>
travel and we get nothing. I wish we clerics got a LLOYD's Beacon at<BR>
level 29 or so. It may not be the perfect answer, but any kind of travel would help us greatly. This is one thing I know will never be addressed. But here is to hoping.

				Boring? Boring they say? Bah! I am a halfling cleric and i have a jolly time where ever i go, nothing like seeing the look on a mummies face after he gets rooted and you cast ward 4 times :) I meet plenty of people that would just love to be my friend and they make good friends them selves, except those ogres that try to eat me. I make a valuable addition to any party and every one is friendly to me...except the ogres that try to eat me...=) I would just like to say that in no way have i found being a cleric to be boring.

				I'd like to add my voice to the &quot;anti-boring&quot; group. Especailly when you get into the high teen levels you learn to use techniques that keep a whole group alive juggling mana and health, and making the crucial judgment on whether or not to use mana for a offensive spell at a critical time in the mele. <BR>
<BR>
I think too that to enjoy being a cleric and finding it exciting, you have to care about the people you group with. If you are just there to power game to get loot, its not for you. If you care a lot about the people you are with, even<BR>
if you just met them, its a fun challenge to do everything in your power to keep your new friends alive in a nasty mele.

				*yawn* I don't really want to discuss the whole boring/not boring issue, but I feel that I must. Let me just say that there's nothing greater than the thrill of knowing that YOU'RE the one that is<BR>
keeping your group alive.  While this takes a LOT of practice (knowing when and why to use mana, when to attack etc) it is COMPLETELY worth it. I've played other classes and I just don't get the<BR>
same rush, and all you players who AREN'T Clerics can't deny how relieved you are when you're being smacked around, are at 1/2 a bubble of health and<BR>
then become miraculously saved by our heal spells.<BR>
<BR>
One thing you have to be careful of, is casting too many heals too soon. Healing party members is just like doing damage to the monster/whatever you're fighting, if you cast too much, you'll be getting hammered by everything and you'll be <BR>
SCREAMING &quot;GET 'EM OFF ME&quot; and hoping your tanks have a good TAUNT rating.<BR>
<BR>
Another not so nice, yet pleasing aspect of the Cleric is, well, watching people die.  This isn't a good idea to to with great frequency, however, you've all grouped with that @$#%%$# who does<BR>
nothing but take all the loot and who couldn't care less about the rest of the group....ANYWAY, after you've taken about as much as you can, you just simply stop healing, say &quot;I'm out of mana, oh crap!&quot; or something, and watch them die.  You'll be feeling better in no time.<BR>
<BR>
ROOT and SMITE will be your best friends for a long while.  So will the spell that causes blindness if you're +pvp or in a duel.  It's so funny to watch people run around aimlessly, while<BR>
you a)med b)wail on them c)cast on them or d)run away as fast as you can.<BR>
<BR>
HAMMER OF WRATH is nice because it gives you a magical melee ability early on, only monks get it as early or earlier.<BR>
<BR>
SUMMON FOOD AND DRINK are nice too, but irritating You'll be poor most of the time, as you'll have to pay for armor and weapons AND spells.  I suggest<BR>
getting a fine steel morningstar as early as you can, to go with the hammer of wrath.<BR>
<BR>
Soloing is an option, but if you aren't doing undead you'll have to be careful after 16 or so depending on where you are, and combat will get mind-numbingly boring.  You wont hit for much, and<BR>
wont get hit for much, so combat will take FOREVER at times, no dual wield or double attack sucks. You'll be able to go afk in the middle of a fight.<BR>
<BR>
Overall, being a cleric is a lot of fun, but it has its drawbacks, the games designers seem to overlook it, no class specific stuff that I know of, cool quests etc, you're POOR, I can't stress<BR>
this enough, especially since they continually change the high loot areas, you'll be reduced to healing and fighting undead a lot of the time.<BR>
<BR>
But your direct damage spells will be better than a magicians at times, you'll be able to solo stuff easier that others of your level if you know what you're doing, and you'll be worshipped by those<BR>
whose lives you save.<BR>
<BR>
The only thing that TRULY irritates me is the fact that some Shaman and Druids will continually tell you that they can heal as well as you can, which is essentially the same as an enchanter telling a wizard that his direct damage spells are just as good, or a rogue or bard telling a warrior that they're equals in hand to hand combat.<BR>
<BR>
My last comment will be simply this:<BR>
<BR>
Halflings kick ass.  Never underestimate the short guy with big feet.<BR>

				You will not regret playing a cleric.  That comment about hi-level clerics being too common, and, therefore, it will be hard to get a party - WRONG!  I am a Lvl 34 cleric and I am swamped with requests to party within a minute or two of loggin on.  You are the indispensable party member.  <BR>
One point, however, if you really want to have fun and be respected and loved in your role, PLAY YOUR CLASS. Sure, I can do several hundred damage with my DD spells, but it is nothing compared to the true nukers.  And your fighters, given time and healing, will wear ANYTHING down.  So, why are you indispensable and loved in a party?<BR>
To truly be respected and sought after you must paly your role - you are a healer.  Your party's health, safety, and effectiveness are your concern.  When you join a party, put your best buffs on each and every party member.  This will ultimately add hundreds of HP to EACH paryt member and, believe me that is appreciated. If appropriate, place protective spells on each member, like Endure Magic or Poison or whatever.  Do it when you join and keep those buffs up.<BR>
Then HEAL.  Carefully gauge how many HP your healing spell can do max, and then hit your players with that heal as soon as they lose that many points.  One exception to this.  I carry a big heal spell and the next lower one as well.  I heal the magic user's as soon as they lose the max HP that the LESSER spell will heal.  You need to keep them up to max HP -- they will appreciate it a lot! And they can die on you quickly if you wait.<BR>
Finally, don't be afraid to med during a fight.  Once you pass level 25 your weapon damage is trivial compared to your fighter's.  So, med up so the party can keep fighting.  If you get ahead of the game, rebuff or cast those DD spells.  I see so many clerics in there pinging away in melee and then yelling &quot;OOM&quot; later in the fight as their fighters start yelling for heals. Ridiculous!<BR>
If you follow these precepts, it won't be the grand nuker that will get the hearty hails and hugs, it won't be the fighter that gets the compiments... It will be YOU, the provider and protector of your party!
