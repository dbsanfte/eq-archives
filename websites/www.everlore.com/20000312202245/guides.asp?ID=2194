Choosing race-
This is very important when you make your Rogue character as you want to choose the race that best fits the way you want to place. Here is a rundown of the available races-

Barbarian-The strong Rogues of Norrath I would suggest only being this if you want a warrior/rogue.

Dark Elf-The Dark Elf rogue isn't very strong but is quite agile and dexterous. However the DE is also evil, which means you will be Killed on Sight (KoS) in most non-evil towns (Freeport for one).

Dwarf-The race I chose. I chose the dwarf because they are strong AND dexterous (unlike the Barbarian who is more strong than dexterous). A good choice for a Rogue. Plus they start out with good sense heading skills.

Gnome-Not as strong as the Dwarf but more agile and dexterous. Plus they have Tinkering, which allows you to create cool little things.

Half Elf-Very agile and dexterous this race makes a fairly good choice for a Rogue.

Halfling-Make the BEST rogues. Their agility and dexterity is the highest of all the classes. This is a VERY good choice for the rogue class.

Human-Personally I don't like Humans. They are base line for everything and are average at all the classes (except for monk). Plus no nightvision REALLY sucks.

Wood Elf-Another very good choice up there with the Halfling. This is a good choice plus the ability to forage for food makes this class a little easier to play a Rogue.

Now that you have an idea of what race you want I will cover the Rogue skills.

Sneak-You start off with this skill and should use it often. This allows you to move slowly and quietly. While this has no real use in the early levels it will later as you will find out.

Hide (LvL 3)-This skill is pretty useful and should be used often to raise it's level. It allows you to disappear from sight making sitting and gathering HP back much safer and easier.

Sense and Disarm Traps-These skills don't have any real use in the game right now as there really are no big traps.

Pick Locks-Again another skill that really have no use as of yet.

Pick Pocket-A very nice skill to have this allows you to steal money from monsters and NPCs. Contrary to popular belief you CANNOT pick pocket PCs. Damn.

Apply Posion and Create poison-Yet more skills that do not have a use as of yet.

Backstab-This skill is what Rogues are known for. This skill is capable of inflicting INCREDIBLE damage, almost as three times as much as a normal attack. You MUST use a piercing weapon (so plan ahead and only use piercing) and you MUST have their back facing you.

Safe Fall-The ability to fall from the highest point in Kelethin and survive where others would leave a soggy stain is quite cool.

Parry-Another way to dodge (in a way) an attack

Dodge-Dodges attacks

Double Attack-This allows you to get that second shot off on the monster while he is recovering from the first. Could mean the difference b'tween life and death.

Dual Wield-The ability to use a weapon in each hand almost doubling the attacking power.

Instill Doubt-Useful when that Hill Giant and the like wants to turn you into a meal this makes them think twice.

Disarm-When fighting an opponent that is wielding a weapon this skill allows you to smack it outta his hand thus rendering nearly defenseless. It also adds a nice variety of weapons to your arsenal.

Riposte-The ability to take an instant potshot at an opponent after they attack you.

Now for the guide.

First off merchants HATE Rogues. The city you start in will tolerate you but, say, if you go to Freeport as a Dwarf Rogue (like me) most merchants will tell you to buzz off. And the ones that do sell jack the prices up. Although this can be a hard life...at least you aint EVIL! That has gotta be harsh to be a Dark Elf.

Level 1-

Grab that lil' dagger and start hacking everything you see. Con EVERYTHING before fighting it otherwise you could find yourself running from a bat whose cousin you just beat the hell out of and you thought you could take this bat that is biting your ass. Gather as much money as you can here you will need it later.

Level 2-5

At this point you should have a decent amount of money saved up and should start looking for patchwork and leather armor. Also at around Level 5 look for a Giant Snake Fang. They have them in Freeport. DO NOT BUY ONE FROM A MERCHANT! They sell them for 7 platinum. Find a player who has one and how much does he sell it for? 5 gold MAX.

Level 6-10

In these levels you get Pick Pocket and Backstab. After getting Backstab the rest of a rogue's life is pretty much easy street. When you reach lvl 5 though SAVE YOUR PRACTICE POINTS. Save the practice points from lvl 6 too. Then when you hit lvl 7 spend them all (15) on Pick Pocket. When you hit lvl 8 save your practice points...same with lvl 9. When you hit lvl 10 waste em all on Backstab.

This concludes my guide for a Rogue and I hope that I was of some help to you beginning rogues out there. Hope to see you on Tarew Marr sometime!
