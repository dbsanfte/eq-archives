</FONT><HR>I have recently recieved an email about an account of someone being wrongfully banned. (I believe it was intended for Verant but was sent to us.) He is appartently being accussed of hacking using some spell cheat. <P>I am putting this account up becuase I believe he is innocent. Recently I have had a friend in Everquest banned for hacking, but he doesn't even have a clue how to hack. My friend would never do such a thing, yet was banned for what I believe to be  misinturrpreted on the Everquest cheater's log. I am guessing that many others have also been wrongfully banned.<P>Just would like to hear an opinion on this matter, and if anyone knows others that have been wrongfully accused.<P><BR>Submitted by: <a href="mailto:jstein@westworld.com">Jeff W. Stein</a><P>---------------------------------------------<P>To Whom It May Concern,<P>Tonight, December 1, 1999 my account was suspended. My account name is "Mesclun" on the Bertoxxulous server. I was" Summoned by the gods" to be told of this. The "god" I spoke with was Tinysa or Tinsya. I was then told my account had shown up on your cheater log. I asked for an explanation of how I cheated, the response was that the god was hoping I could tell her. I went on to plead my case. I told the god to simply look at me, my equipment, my money, my level, my time logged with this character, the records you must keep of my petitions. The response I got was " You are Banned ". I was given no instances in which I cheated, no evidence, and lastly, no care or concern for the actions being taken against me. I HAVE NEVER CHEATED! I'm not aware of how your systems work , but in all lines of work and in all operations, I have never heard of a perfect system that exists! Yet your representative apparently believes yours to be so. Do not forget I am the customer, and that a contract works both ways, that being the case I feel I have been treated disrespectfully! Quite simply, it is your obligation to prove I have cheated before you take action, and to make that evidence available to me. In your "reviewing" of my account you will find that I never have cheated, therefor your actions are premature and are a fine example of your regard for your customers. I am very upset by this, as would be anyone who has put over 27 days of time into Everquest, you will see it's more than that in your review. <P>When my account is reinstated, I expect a check to be made out to me for the time my account was suspended. I, unfortunately, will continue to be your customer, but only because of the product. No apology is necessary, as it is meaningless to me, the damage is done. Your actions have already demonstrated to me your true nature. Rest assured, I will take this situation much more seriously than your representative has. Lastly, I will state my case again - I have never cheated, nor would I know how.<BR> <BR>P.S.-From a business stand-point your GM who I had the displeasure of dealing with said something to me along the lines of "You're banned hacker!". I'm sure you don't want your representatives portraying this type of attitude/image to the public. You should review your log, I'm sure you can check this out.<BR> <BR>Added Dec. 2 for JButler@verant,<BR> <BR>I just spoke with Frank Lizarraga from tech support as that was the telephone number I was given to call. He confirmed that I have been banned for "using a spell hack". Simply I am not, I wouldn't know how, but I can think of a possible problem. You can verify this, My character "Mescalito" reached level 27 and acquired skill points suitable to that level, I have since lost my level. Is it possible that this caused a glitch or gave your GM a misrepresentation of the truth? Again, quite simply, look at my character. I have all the spells suitable for my class/level and many I haven't got because my research ability is too low. My spells fizzle just like everybody's, they get interrupted,etc... I do have one more posible solution, sometime over the holiday weekend the Greater Faydark zone was down and on numerous occassions I tried to teleport there, only for the spell to act like a gate spell, returning me to the zone I was bound in, but not the location of binding. Again, please check your records, as I petitioned about this very problem, but unfortunately there was no response, for whatever reason no Names came up when I hit the GM list button. Lastly, Mr. Lizarraga first suggested that I contact the GM that banned me. Due to the fact, that this GM, did nothing help me last night, or in any way try to ease the situation, I am fearful that he/she rather enjoys having the final say. Please, I appeal to your business sense, review the evidence for yourself, look at the logs of our conversation when I was banned, look at my character, I offer you free access to my computer and all it's files, I may even consider sending it to you for your own evaluation- as long as it be timely and I can be assured it will be treated properly. The bottom line is this, I did not cheat, and being that I have logged as much time as I have I am willing to do whatever necessary to rectify this mistake. I have added my telephone number so that you may contact me immediately if you have the need. ***-***-*** <P>Sincerely,<BR> <BR>Jeff W.

</FONT><HR>After reading the submitted letter, I definitely think he is wrongly accused and disciplined in an ill manner at best.  My opinion doesn't count for anything when it comes to this, I know.  Still, I would like to think that Verant would use the "Innocent until proven guilty" method.  It seems they do not, and that is disturbing.  I wonder how many have been innocent and still banned from a game they invested much time and energy into.  Jeff has my sympathy.  I hope Verant makes whatever compensations they can.

</FONT><HR>Well, I guess I'd better not sneeze while playing as I may inadvertantly hit a keystroke and therefore be banned for hacking.<P>Seriously, we all have probably done something(albeit innocently) that could be considered cheating.  If it is done innocently, then it is a mistake, as in, "Oops, I'm sorry, it won't happen again."  If it is done purposefully, then it is cheating and therefore bannable(is that a word?).  However, I'm not sure that "cheating" is "hacking".  Yes, hacking is cheating, but cheating isn't necessarily hacking.  If I'm going to go to jail, I'd really like to know what for instead of just getting thrown into a cell and being told, "YOU BROKE THE LAW!"<P>This definitely isn't right.  However, we haven't heard Verant's side of the story(although from what he described and from the experiences I've seen with the GMs and the power trips they get on, I wouldn't be suprised).  Xanthus, I believe you would make a good "moderater/judge" and I think Verant and the accused should bring their cases before you and let you decide.<P>Jalagi Wardancer<BR>Warrior in the realm of Rallos Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=001016.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=Everlore+Main+Hall&TopicSubject=Everquest+Banning+-Wrongly+Accused">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>Hmmm...I hope I'm not banned for something I did!<P>I wanted my girlfriend to play EQ with me when it first came out. She brought her computer over and I plugged it into my extra phone line. I wanted her to play on my account so that she could use one of my characters to goof around with. Also, so she would get killed in two seconds flat by every little level 1 PK in Rallos Zek. (You know who you are!)<P>Not even thinking I was doing anything wrong, as soon as she logged in with my password and Station ID, my main character frose up on my screen. I then got the message "Cheater File Updated." I was like, "WTF!?"<P>I guess logging your own ID and password twice is against the rules (and no where does it state that in any literature that Verant has published, including the opening agreement). So, I guess I am a cheater for trying to let my girlfriend use one of my characters while I play my main one. <P>The thing is, if I am paying $10 a month to utilize my account and characters, why can't I log two computers and use the same account, especially if it is in the same hosuehold? I can understand this being a crime if you were passing your information out to every message board and all of a sudden 1000 people are using your station ID and password to play for free. But, hell, there is my girlfriend right next to me and I'm being called a cheater. <P>I hope I'm not banned...BAH!<P>/rude Verant<P>------------------<BR>Synnyr Seyvyer<BR>48th Season Halfling Druid<BR>Rallos Zek<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=001016.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=Everlore+Main+Hall&TopicSubject=Everquest+Banning+-Wrongly+Accused">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>I sympathize with the first poster about the treatment he is receiving. He should have the right to confront his accuser and review any evidence against him. I will make no judgement on innocence or guilt  until or unless I hear Verant's side. We have no idea why they banned the account.Perhaps someone hacked his account and was using it (on another server) when he wasn't on. <BR>Froggystyle, I believe there is something in the license about having only one active version running per account. Hopefully it is not a banable offence. As long as you don't repeat the offence and are appologetic you should have no trouble.<BR>This is how I see it I have no power in Verant.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=001016.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=Everlore+Main+Hall&TopicSubject=Everquest+Banning+-Wrongly+Accused">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR> I agree completely that the writer of the above letter is innocent! Verant should have to prove that the person actually hacked.I hope this does'nt happen to me or anyone else.If someone hacks they should be punished but banning is a little extreme for a first offense don't you think?
