<BR>
&quot;East Common lands is one of the most popular regions of Norrath. The Scenery is spectacular, the wildlife is stunning (even the griffins), and the area is filled with people. There is also many people seeking partners for fighting if your interests lie there. The one downfall to East Commons is the great problem of the DeathFist Orcs. These orcs have been causing the city of Freeport and the commonlands a great deal of trouble. Besides this little problem, the East Commons is an area to love and explore!<BR>
<BR>
							-Trumpy's guide to the Galaxy&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Well, thought Faradil, I guess that place is for me then, a calm quiet place for me to sell my wares in peace. Faradil was a great Paladin of Norrath. He had been living for many years and practically knew his way all around Norrath. The one problem with being a human not liked by the people of Freeport is you never really come near Freeport without getting killed. Because of this, he never really spent much time in that area. This had been true after the little mishap he had with a prisoner he found in the Freeport Arena. Life had never truly been the same after that. Anyway, back to the story&#8230;.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Faradil was a powerful Paladin who needed a rest. After his long and tiring quest for the Fiery Avenger, which he now prided himself in having, had really started to take a toll on the amount of energy he had. Also, his endless campaigning had brought him to great wealth and now he though it time to settle down and relax for a few days. East Commons seemed just the place. He had just packed up and was on his way North. Living in Upper Guk right now, it really wasn't the place that suited him. Constantly having to fight off frogs of all kinds, this place was going to be a much needed rest.<BR>
<BR>
The journey up to East Commons was relatively UN-eventful. He has a small miss-hap with the specters of Oasis but that was quickly resolved without much problems by talking with the end of his sword.<BR>
<BR>
Faradil was very lucky, usually people going on vacation had to pay large sums of Platinum to be able to stay in the area, luckily for him, he had a old Paladin friend who was away on some quest for some flaming sword and let him stay in his hut. Far was just lying down to have a nice sleep when he heard the strangest sound. &quot;Bandolaf yells for help to the North West of you&quot;. Now, this is not something you hear yelled every day. Whatever the problem, Far jumped quickly out of his bed, Grabbed his sword, stored safely in a large Iron Box, and ran off to see what the problem was. Instantly after he ran out the door, he saw what was the problem. A dwarf, about 500 feet away, was being chased by 4 large green Orcs. Quickly, he ran up to them and proceeded to lay waste to all in his path.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You slash a Orc Warrior for 550 damage.<BR>
A Orc Warrior has been slain by Faradil!<BR>
Faradil slash a Orc Warrior for 436 damage.<BR>
A Orc Warrior has been slain by Faradil!<BR>

A Orc Warrior has been slain by Faradil!<BR>
You Slash a Orc Priest for 305 damage.<BR>
A Orc priest says &quot;Conrads avenge my death! Centurions to arms!&quot; <BR>
A Orc priest has been slain by Faradil!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Thank you so much for helping me&quot; thanked the dwarf. &quot;It was nothing&quot;, said Far as he walked back into his house. &quot;Those Orcs were just really stupid to try and attack around here&quot;. &quot;They are pretty extremely normal around here now, they basically own the place. Whenever their Legionnaires come out, all people flee for their lives.&quot; &quot;Is it that big a problem?&quot; Far asked. &quot; Extremely&quot; wailed the dwarf. &quot;And the problem is getting worse all the time. Nobody can travel around the forest anymore.&quot; &quot; Well I, Faradil of Tunar, vow that I will cleanse this area of the foul orcs&quot; &quot;Aye you will, and my name is Bandolaf the Dwarf.&quot; &quot;By the way, what is your name, now that you bring that up?&quot; &quot;Bandolaf the Dwarf, Servant to the great healer&quot;. Far stopped and thought about this for a second&#8230;&quot; Hey, so you believe that I will be will be able to do it?&quot; &quot; Aye, I do&quot;. With this said, Band slapped Far over the back and they both went off to have a great feast of Wild Boar. <BR>
<BR>
After they had both had a lot of Dwarven Ale, that Bandolaf had so conveniently brought with them, the talking began about their new found quest. &quot;So&quot;, Far started, &quot; please give me a better insight on what is going on with these orcs&quot;. &quot; There is not much to say, I guess the orcs came here a few years ago, not many of them at the time, nobody really cared about them. Then the Legionnaires came with the great Weapons smith and all hell started to break loose. Now both the commonlands are filled with these creatures, nobody really has any idea what to do&quot;. Far sat back and thought about this, there didn't seem to be much in the way of planning to do for this he thought. &quot;I have an idea, it might take some work and a lot of fighting but if we could slowly nock out the Orc camps one at a time, we might have a chance.&quot; Now Band sat back and thought about this, &quot; That would work, There is usually one to two orcs max at each camp. If we could systematically take one camp at a time, we might have a fighting chance!&quot; &quot;Well then,&quot; Far shouted &quot; Let our quest commence!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
And so, Faradil and Bandolaf attacked the Orc camps one at a time,  always in the dead of night. Coming and going just as fast they were thought to be ghosts or evil spirits. They encountered less problems than they had thought. The orcs weren't really much of a match for the two conrads and so the going was rather easy. Finally, on the Eve of Christmas, just as a light dusting of snow came was coming out of the night sky, Faradil and Bandolaf approached their last camp. This was the one of the weapons smith himself. He had a large band of his best troops stationed there and Bandolaf had though it best if they brought some help. His help came in the form of a powerful druid named Shaeria. Bandolaf had heard of Shaeria from previous battles that she had taken place in and now he doubted that they would have any problems. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;So&quot; Scoffed Shaeria, &quot;Why did you drag me down here to deal with these measly orcs? Really, they are so easy, I can kill this entire camp, no problem!&quot; &quot;Calm down Sha,&quot;Band soothed,&quot; These are much harder than normal. These are the top soldiers of the Orc Weapons smith, the leader of the Orc raids in this area. We will have a much harder time with these 10 or 12 Orcs that here that with any others we have faced.&quot; &quot;Now&quot;, interrupted Faradil,&quot; We must think of I plan, I personally think that we can make the attack directly, who is with me on that?&quot; &quot;The plan is kinda basic but if we plan our attack routes, we should have no problem keeping alive. Far, I will stay back healing while Sha nukes them. All you gotta do is take the hits.&quot; &quot;That's easy for you to say, you just heal the holes,  you don't get them&quot; After little planning, they had come up with good routes of attack that allowed for a quick escape, if that would be needed.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Faradil shouts &quot;ATTACK!!!!!&quot;<BR>
The Orc Weapons Smith shouts &quot;Conrads to arms, send these filthy vermin back to their graves!!!&quot;<BR>

Bandolaf says &quot;Wow, awesome luck, good job sha!&quot;<BR>
Shaeria says &quot; I think I will keep this as a pet, I shall call it Silverwing&quot;<BR>
Faradil says &quot;Ya good work Sha, we finally eliminated the Orcs from this land!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And so, all returned to normal. Faradil left to go back to Lower Guk where some of his friends were stuck in a room and they needed help. Bandolaf continued to walk around shouting healing and buffs for donation! And Shaeria and Silverwing decided that they now needed a vacation and made a journey to Kunark where there was rumored to be some interesting sights to see!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The End<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Well, Second story complete! I think that this one is shorter than the last one but still good. I really appreciated the replies I got on my last story and I look forward more. Thanks for the encouragement,<BR>

				Actually, Faradil(my character) is only a level 5 warrior. I just make up the stories with names of characters that I get. If you want me to do up a story with certain names and characters, e-mail them to me. On the Bertoxx server, please feel free to give me a small donation if you feel this story is worth it(main character:shaeria).<BR>

Thanks<BR>

				Note: Changed last name, I just leveled to 20 today! and wolfshadow was taken. Anyway, new last name is Wisperwolf. I just thought that I would let everyone know that I am basing my next story on a suggestion I recieved from e-mail. It will involve a group of adventurers taking back a city(probably Freeport but I am opened to suggestion) from the currupt city guards... sound interesting, I hope it turns out well,<BR>

				One note, if Far was using the fiery avenger he would have had to be a paladin, but you had him kick a orc, which paladin's can't do. Should do a tad more research. *grins*<BR>
