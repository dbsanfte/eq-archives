<!--<tr><td><font face="verdana">    These notes are mostly for newer players, but many of the things are still seldom heard of.  Also if you have heard of other nifty ideas that might aid in adventuring, contact me at daakon@daakon.com.
    In the game world, many items you find can aid you more then if you sell them.  Taking this in mind, here is a list of things to think about.  I am rather new to the world with a couple chars around the early teens, but my travels have been with some much more experienced players.  I will also offer other various insights of things to use to your advantage.

    Food and drink:  Snake eggs count as a food item.  If you can find milk or bread to fill these needs, they are the cheapest things around.

    Light sources:  Fire beetle eyes can be of some assistance in others finding you.  Take this into consideration when traveling with a group.  It allows fer easier following of one another.

    Hunting:  Many a time you can find 2 different creatures within yer level range.  Many a time one creature is easier for you to kill or may offer better loot.  Consider this when fighting many things.  Also to consider is the weight of items if you cannot carry a lot.  The other thing to think about is if the items a creature gives are stackable.  If yer inventory fills up very quickly yer efficiency goes down.  Also hunting critters that can allow you to accomplish a quest repeatedly can be very helpful, as well as creatures that give you status.  These help you more in the long run then you may realize.  Costs of items will be better as well as you may get more rewarding quests in the towns.

    Quests:  When trying to complete rather simple quests you may want to think about trying to bring enough of the needed things back to complete the quest multiple times.  Also another note when talking to NPC's.  Remember that the quests are case sensitive so capitalizing the words the NPC says is important.

    Trade skills:  If you ant to work on gettin a skill up.  Offer attemps at item creation for ppl fer the price of the materials.  This way they may save significant amounts of money and also allow you to go up in that skill.

    Kindness:  Now I am sort of a preacher of being kind unto others.  But let me list a few reasons why you might want to consider kindness to all you meet.  After staying in an area fer a while I began to see familiar faces often.  We began setting up trading between several ppl creating a network that allowed us to find items we were looking fer as well as saving us money all around in the long run.  Beyond that we also saved one another from time to time.  Most of these folks I spoke very little with and never grouped with any of them.  I have noticed this is a good thing to do in almost any land as any race/class.

    Combat Note:  Attacking from behind a critter offers bonuses to the attack.  But also a critter attacking from behind you offers them a bonus.  try to always face yer enemies if yer fighting more then one.  Also if in a group try surrounding the critter to confuse it as well as offer a better advantage in ways of attacks.

I will try to record more of the little subtleties that can aid in yer adventures fer a future addition to this guide.</font></td></tr>-->
