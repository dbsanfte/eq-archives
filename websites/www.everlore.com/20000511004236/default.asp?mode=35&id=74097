			<font face="verdana" size="2" color="black">As most of us Ogres already know Clurg is the Bar Keep<BR>
of Oggok.  With a little investigation, actually, just asking<BR>
him questions about the bracketed text he will tell you <BR>
a little bit more about himself.  Ask him this question <BR>
first off, &quot;What are Bouncers?&quot;  He will then procede to <BR>
tell you that he was a world traveler and that he encountered<BR>
great enforcers called Bouncers.  After he rose to greatness<BR>
after the creation of the Flaming Clurg he organized a <BR>
Bouncer squad to keep the [rival guilds] in check.  He tells<BR>
you of the feud between the Greenbloods, Crakneks, and<BR>
Shamans of War and then mysteriously he gives you a clue<BR>
of his past.  &quot;Few remember that I, Clurg, was once dim<BR>
but know I now speak with great words.&quot;  I then proceded<BR>
to bombard him with questions involving the text.  Nothing.<BR>
No further words at all.  I decided to go to my guild leader<BR>
Soonog of the Greenblood Knights.  Tell him you are a <BR>
Greenblood regardless of your class.  He will give you a <BR>
lizard meat quest.  Ask him, &quot;Who are Crakneks?&quot;.  He<BR>
will then tell you that they are the Greenbloods enemy <BR>
and that the Bouncers keep them from bashin'.  Ask him, <BR>
&quot;What are Bouncers?&quot;  He will then say, &quot;I'm a Bouncer. <BR>
I'm the bestest Bouncer.  Clurg makes us.&quot;  When you<BR>
ask him, &quot;Who is Clurg&quot;  He will go through a spiel.  &quot;He is<BR>
the best grog maker.  He gives speshil mug for grog to<BR>
Bouncers . . . You can read it for yourself.  Everyone knows<BR>
that the &quot;speshil&quot; mug is the Crude Stein do to the <BR>
recent fad of slaying Ogre Guards in Oggok.  I happened<BR>
to have one in the bank so I decided to give it to Clurg<BR>
to see what would happen.  *Quest Music* &quot;Hmm its <BR>
empty.  Only Bouncers and lucky ones get to drink this.<BR>
It will take your pain away.&quot;  This is where you take your<BR>
Crude Stein to get it refilled but be warned.  After you<BR>
give it to him it becomes NO RENT so if you log it will<BR>
be missing from your inventory.  You may be wondering <BR>
where the hell I'm going with this.  What I've written so<BR>
far is how I stumbled on the quest.  Here is the interesting<BR>
part.  After giving Clurg the Crude Stein I was at a dead <BR>
end.  I went to my guild and asked series after series <BR>
of fruitless questions. So I walked to the Craknek guild and asked Guntrik<BR>
the leader of the Warriors, &quot;Who was Clurg?&quot; to humor myself.  To my <BR>
surprise he gave me the same spiel that Soonog gave <BR>
me when I asked him.  I then asked every single warrior<BR>
in the guild the same thing.  Only Lork didn't answer me.<BR>
All but one gave the same spiel.  So I decided to give the<BR>
Bouncer a shot.  They said the same thing.  Then the <BR>
merchants.  The same.  Can this be the quest?  To try<BR>
and find the few that remember when Clurg was once dim.<BR>
I asked this to every single NPC in Oggok.  Marda, Zulort, <BR>
Jargo, and Lork didn't give me the spiel.  This is basically<BR>
where I am today.  I don't know where to go from here.<BR>

				  im very impressed by the amount of work you put into this, but  im curious about your result to date.  you say that you got your stein recharged by giving it to clurg, but what effect or power does it get? the stein of moggok, which clurg gives after the bartender's compendium quest has an effect of light healling (which would certainly take your pain away...) i wonder if this has anything to do with the quest at all.  I am reluctant to give my moggok stein to him to find out if it gets recharged.  Please post what effect was given to the crude stein.  <BR>

				  Ok i tried my crude stein, giving it to clurg.  indeed it does get charged with the effect of light healling.  i used this effect, on a lark, to see if i could immediately get it refilled again.  no dice.  clurg pretended to refill the stein, but he pulled a fast one on old Hecubis.  he kept my crude stein.  i dont feel so robbed, i'll get another easily, but be forwarnd that the item cannot be recharged more than once, and that recharging it even a single time most definately results in a no rent mug.  this further clinches my resolve to not try getting my stein of moggok recharged.

				Okay just a minor update.  Since all of the Oggok Npc's say the same thing with regards to Clurgs past I began to wonder if the &quot;one who knew&quot; was even in Oggok at all.  Clurg talks of an imposter drink being served in Neriak so I decided to go ask Pungla, who I have killed many times for Clurg in the past, who Clurg was.  She didn't say anything of course.  I asked her &quot;What is a Flaming Clurg?&quot;  She said this, &quot;What!?  Me not hear of that.&quot;  Could this mean that Clurg is an imposter?  I don't know.  I tried to jog Pungla's memory by giving her a Crude Stein and a Flaming Clurg to see what she would say.  &quot;Thank you!&quot;  You can purchase Flaming Punglas for three gold a piece but who would want to drink the imitation when they could easily get the real thing?  Does anyone know who to give Flaming Punglas to?  Okay that's where I am today.  Oh, and I found out that the Npc's in Oggok respond to &quot;Who is Greenblood?&quot; and &quot;Who is Chef Dooga?&quot;  I could use some help on this.

				Lets not get too distracted by the imposter drink quest because as far as I know (and I've done that quest a few times too) it has no relation to the question at hand. We're searching for some ogre history involving Clurg, Chef Dooga, and the mysterious Moggok.<BR>
<BR>
Moggok interests me the most and I've only seen a few references to him. One would obviously be the Stein of Moggok (Please do not ask for info on this quests, there is a very good walkthrough here at Everlore under &quot;Complete Spoiler for Stein of Moggok Quest&quot;), the right eye of Moggok (a no drop item you sometimes get by giving Lenka Stoutheart her pouch back), and a message from Ping Fuzzlecutter (A gnome merchant who sold Moggok a wig in West Freeport).<BR>
<BR>
If anybody has any info about the whereabouts or any more references to Moggok, please post them. Try to ask every ogre you can find, there are the ones in West Karana, the merchant in West Freeport, the one with Lenka Stoutheart (watch out, he's part of Wolves of the North and will kos ogres), the ones in Neriak (though very few talk), and obviously there are the ogres in Oggok itself.

				I just read the new posts and I'll start on the search for Moggok immediately but I have a few more things to add about the faction structure of Oggok itself.  Here's a little tidbit on the &quot;feud&quot;.  The Greenbloods, the &quot;Shamans and Shadder Knights&quot;, are at war with the Craknek Warriors led by Guntrik.  This is for all you Ogres out there who unknowingly replied to one of Guntrik's questions, you aren't the only ones out there who fell for it.  I too asked for my face to be bashed.  He slashes for 356 and bashes for 256.  What purpose does that serve other than exp loss?  Is it just Verant's way of saying, &quot;Silly Ogie Monkeys!  Its no wonder you have fallen from Zek's grace.&quot;  Well I was determined to figure out a purpose for those brackets so one day I got a cleric buddy of mine to hit me with a resolution and a symbol, downed a SoW potion, and headed to the warrior guild.  My logic here was that since Crakneks and Greenbloods are at war with each other they would certainly have negative faction with each other and the result of this, if brought in close proximity of each other, would cause them to fight.  I summoned a pet (SK Wuss Skeli), gave myself a shieldskin to humor myself, and hail Guntrik with &quot;I want you to bash my face!&quot;.  Narrowly escaping with have my life I called for my pet's assistance and stumbled half dazed into the Greenblood guild.  I feigned death and when had about 4 bubbles of Hit points I stood up to re-agro him.  My Class Guildmates didn't do Jack!!  Silly Ogie Monkey Kegg, why, oh why must you be so damn curious to the point of stupidity.  I'm thinking now that I have to kill Clurg for all hell to break loose in Oggok but ya know what?  That can wait.  Anyway, I just wanted to not that all Greenblood and Craknek quests give positive faction with themselves and Clurg while Shaman quests only give faction with themselves.  As far as the Stein of Moggok is concerned I'll buy one and try to get it recharged today.  I'll also ask everyone in Oggok if they know about Moggok.  Alright back to Norrath, late.

				Anyone interested in the stein of moggok quest needs to read here.  You need to get 4 items from all accross Norath.  You need kiola nuts from the island of Erollisi, Eruds tonic from Erudin, Honey jum from rivervale, and a koalindl fish from the temple of life pool.  The kiola nuts can be bought from the vender in the building right off of the docks on Erollisi Island in the Ocean of Tears. You get the Erud's tonic buy going to the bluehawk Inn in Erudin and buy a drink off of Geord BlueHawk called Innoruuks kiss of death.  Take this and give it to Sinnkin Highbrow at the top of the library in Erudin and she give you the tonic(lore item, no drop).  Next you need to get the koalindl fish out of the temple of life pool. The easiest way to do this is create a human SK and jump into the pool and harmtouch the fish.  Then log in as you main charactar and pick up the Koalindl fish off of the corpse(pray its there because after killing one of these your sk becomes kos in Quenos and you will most likely have to start a new sk) The Koalindl fish is also no drop.  The last ingredient you need is hunny jum from rivervale. Kill bixies to get 3 honey combs(or just give a tell and people will sell willingly) then give the 3 honeycombs and 30 gp to Kizzie Mintopp(kizzie is in a small building close to the Fools Gold)She will give you the honey jum.  Now take all these items to the a bar that is on the docks in East Freeport and give them to Gregor(gregor uses these items to make the flaming clurg drink that clurg talks about).  He will then give you a bartenders compendelum(lore-item, nodrop).  You take this to clure and he give you stein of moggok(it may be just a glowing stein so you may have to identify it to see that its the stein of moggok).  And that is the whole quest start to finish. Good luck because i hear gregor doesn't like dark races, and there isn't that big of a chance that clurg is going to like light races. 8*P

				The Stein of Moggok isn't our concern here.  We are currently trying to track down Moggok, or any information pertaining to him or his location.  Does anyone know if there is a text file to the Barkeep Compendium?  Just curious.
