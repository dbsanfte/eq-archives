			<font face="verdana" size="2" color="black">It was a fine sunny day as I entered this world with nothing but a note a little food and water and a cheapo dagger and 2 glorius spells.  Yet I did not no how to cast oh the glorius spells the magic of this world was so beautiful.  I set off into my home town all the time wondering around the world wa sos beautiful to a newborn magician.  I asked around being polite to everyone how to get to my guild and a kind soul I forget the name it was so long ago told me I have to zone into another part of the city.  That I did and soon found my guild.  Well accidentally typeing &quot;hello&quot; to my guild leader I hit &quot;a&quot; and started attacking her.  She nuked me for god knows what and her damage shield was enough to kill me. What a great start I said to myself as I wetn back I was careful not to say anything this time. I gave her the note and recieved a beautiful tunic.  I was petrified with joy as I reacher greater faydark with my new spells memerized and ready to take action.  I did not know what I was doing and attacked a bee after I buffed my self with the crapiest shielding ever.  But the colors were so beutiful as that magic streamed out of my high elf hands I didnt care.  I attacked the bee and to my suprise I died.  I tried nuking it and forgot I had a dagger.  I was very discouraged and ready to give up when a kind soul came by.  He said dont worry son you will become strong in time and people will love all the stuff you can summon for them.  So I stuf with it and killed a couple beees nuking and stabbing soon I hit lvl 2.  I felt like I could kill anything and was almost foolish enough to try.  &quot;aka the priest of dischord&quot; haha that would have been a funny joke.  Next thing you know I was already lvl 3 being careful to attack easy stuff since I had no good magic and no elemental yet. I bought summon food and water and next thing ya know everyone was begging me for soem summoned stuff.  Not knowing how the stuff worked I summeoend like 60 of each not knowing that when I went to sleep and woke up again my food and water and all summoned stuff would be gone.  I was very sad but it was good practice for my conguration skill.  Soon I hit lvl 4 and finnaly saved up enough cash to buy my new nulkeing spell a new buff and an earth elemental pet.  They looked so beutiful especially when they cast spells that earthquake spell looks so cool. I had make my way to orc camp with my new found abilty to make my own friends I was very excited.  I relized I had to split some damage with them at this lvl and take some of the hits from orcs.  It was ok though I was very happy.  I had made many freinds now and was ina  guild knights of rage.  we had a couple lvl 30 and everyone in their was very nice to me.  I had a full set of cloth armor by then and when I hti lvl 10 I mad ea decision.  I was going to leave greater faydark.  It was a big step to think you can travel the world but my friends gave me directions and I came to the butcherblock mountain entrances.  I came in and met a friened named kittie a fellow magcian who had a beutiful gossimer robe.  She introduced me to her friends tiffanyhead, tryx, and bubblegoose they were a higher lvl than me but helped me fight my way to lvl 12 at the chessboard.  Tryx and I became very good friends and I later asked her to marry me but was rejected.  I found it was time to leave this continent.  Of course this was after I fought in lesser faydark a lot.  I was so excited to take the boat. It was mystical in all its wonders.  I came to freeport like a kid on christams and talked to everyone.  I got myself a bind by myself and bound like 5 other people hehe.  I went over their for a reason though.  I wanted woven armor reel bad and I was determied to get it. So I traveled invis to upper guk a wretched place I would liek to never return to.  the frogs were easy ubtil you actually went ina  little bit and everytime they would run when you were about to kill them.  And in dungeons pets arn't welcome as they start mobs of trains coming from every direction. but I fought hard an liong for a while and fiunnaly I had a full suit of woven and had met a nice necromencer named hillbilly.  I was yet to meet my greatest of freidns in the game though.  Also I bought a beutiful gossimer robe for a good 30pp off a nice fellow.  And next thing you know I was lvl 16 and pissed at a guy named Dorn B Dynn.  A dark elf NPC who killed everything I have even seen him kill lvl 24 clerics and what not.  But the worst part was I couldnt find my earth pet.  I heard a fellow say try researching it.  So I did and wasiets 60pp all my money on fails.  But finnaly I got it.  Pissed at dorn I though I would just try him he conned black to me at lvl 16 but people say he fights like a lvl 21.  I said what have I got to lose and to my suprise I barley beat him.  I though I would have surley died but I won.  I was so happy I didnt knwo what to do.  Poeple all cheared and congragulated me.  But my life was getting boring so I decided to be reborn asa dwarf paladin I sold all of my stuff including my dragoon dirk and all my armor and bought some bronze armor and a combine scimatar and a SBS.  but I was bound in greater faydark as I decided to go to freeport at lvl 5. That is when I met one of my best friends Orec Kookie.  At the time he was a lvl 35 wizard and said he would port me.  I thanked him greatly and when I got their and got to the platform someone brough dorn and I died. still bound in kelethin I was sad as I was tired I said I cant log by the time I get their I will lose all my stuff.  That is when I made the stupidest mistake of my life.  What I thought obe  a kindf player said she would teleport my stuff back stole it all.  Vixonia was her name.  I was filled with rage.  She could not even teleport and was reborn into bimbonia.  A Dark elf warrior.  I was so mad I didnt know what to do. Everything I had worked for gonbe all of 2 months work.  I was so sad. I finnaly returned with Ace and was campng byt the platform but it was too late.  Bimbonia was gone.  But I saw the resurring shiny rubicite armor of the nicest and my best freind sin the game Kiarae.  She had a ghoulbane one of the best 1hs weopons in the game and a full suit of rubicite armor.  The best armor in the game in my opinion. She was so nice she talked to me for a while and I helped her kill soem stuff.  I asked her where she got the armor and sword and she smiled and said.  I have a lvl 50 the highest in the game named blazen.  Blazen is a cleric.  But I got reborn into kiarae to try a paladin.  I talked to kiarae every day and asked her out only to relize she was married.  To someone i nto dare argue with.  It was Mills the lvl 50 palidin with Soulfire.  The hardest and best known weopon in the wolrd of norrath.  I was happy I had got back some of my stuff and met some nice friends when I emt a very kind warioir.  He asked if I could summon him 80 bandages he said he would pay well.  I said I will do it for free because it was no task for me a lvl 18 magician.  I was in oasis when I gave them to him and he though I was so nice he gave me a ring.  I sold it for 300pp and bought a stein of maggok.  With no weopon and a stein of maggok in one hand and a skull of jntra in the tohewr I ventured out into lake rathe to fight guards.  Aviak guards that is.  Byt his time my guild had been disbanded to my dissapointment it was ok though I had many other firends starting a guild but it never happened.  They are still freinds though.  I finnaly hit lvl 20 and met an old friend in lake rathe. It was nuna a druid now lvl 21 we talked about our adventures since we had not seen eachother since lvl 4. Then another suprise I saw bubblegoose.  She was almost lvl 30 by bow and very powerful.  I ahd bad news thought o share with everyone the next day.  I had to leave norrath for I faields a spanish test.  Not know what to do with about 600pp worth of magician stuff I had orec teleport me to my hometown in greater faydark.  I took off al my stuff and though you know what this game is prejiduce.  people are only nice to high lvl people most of the time.  And never talk to other newbies.  Unless you have nice items they consider fighting orcs a more worthwhile time.  I took off al my atuff so I was almost naked and asked politley for some food.  I went anonymous but still had a last name.  That should have given it away.  I must have asked liek 20 people and veeryone was to busy fighting orcs.  Oh well their loss I found a nice little gnow enchanter by the name of mbenie and she gave me 3 iron rations.  In return for her being so nice I gave her 600pp worth of stuff to a lvl 2.  This was alwats my dream tthat someone would do this for me and it never happened.  It just shows yuo be nice to everyoen and good things will come to you.  Well I hope you had fun reading ym life it was fun to live.  I have come back to norrath for I passed the next spanish test and hopefully I will see you on EcI.  Good luck to you all and thankyou for your time.
