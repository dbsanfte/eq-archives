It's pretty easy for us from levels 1-5.  If you are leaving Neriak take the path into Nektulos and start heading down the path.  You will run into a stump to your right and a log to your left.  Hunt on the left side of that log....you will find decaying skeletons, spiderlings, fire beetles, wolves and snakes.  Occasionally a Bear, Young Kodiak or Skeleton may run through their....be carefull not to attract their attention.  If you haven't read about it yet, let me tell you.  Nektulos is the hardest newbie grounds in all of Norrath.  It has everything from moss snakes and spiderlings too Young Kodiaks, Mummies and Tree Snakes...all of which are at least 8th level and above creatures...all running around the same forest.  If you stay to the left of that log your first 5 levels should be a breeze....and Nektulos being so large....you'll know right where your corpse is.  

In those first five levels also work on your skills like taunt and sense heading.  Basically put Taunt and Sense Heading on hot keys....and everytime you get into a fight...just keep hitting them until the fight is over.  You won't go up very fast...but they will go up eventually.  Also work on your swimming skills inside Neriak.  There are many places for you too swim around with no danger to you....practise in those small lakes and ponds and remember to surface for air.  

After level 5 it becomes a little more annoying for Shadow Knights.  We aren't as good as a warrior and we still can't cast at all.  These levels will be tough and be prepared to die alot.  My best suggestion through is too group up and hunt at the first intersection before the bridge...you should get good exp and make plenty of loot.  After 7th or 8th level...with a group you can safely hunt at either the rune near the ECom border or the temple.  Be carefull though because every once in a while a mummy or zombie will pop up...plus random young kodiaks wander around.  Also watch out for halfling camps.  These little runts are viscious.  If you get a good group of 8-10th levelers you can take most of em out no problem.

Nektulos forest will get you to 8th-10th level with not too many problems....eventually you can head to East Commonlands and have a blast...you'll be around 9th level then...so enjoy your spells and spread the word of Innoruuk my brothers.</font></td></tr>-->

				At around the 9th lvl, you should head to Najena through the lavastorm mountains.  The entrance has a few spawn spots for large and greater skeles.  Fight anything blue to you, and dont worrk about trains.  Stay near the zone entrance and if you're in trouble, zone.  Large skeles give good exp to a lvl 9 sk.  Once I was in Najena, and saw a lvl 8 necro, with healing from a lvl 16 cleric, solo 3-4 large skeles.  The next day, he was lvl 12.  Exp is good for lvl 9's, but prepare to zone a lot.<BR>

Find me there if u r on Xegony.<BR>
