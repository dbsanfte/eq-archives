</FONT><HR>You my friend have some problems, and I don't think eq is to blame.  <P>Clip:<BR>(And to live life... with passion and mystery... to love that life you were given. When you have found your true love, when you have explored this world that God gave us, when you have fully done everything you need to in life, when you have achieved all that you want, then you can flame me. Then you can tell me I'm wrong. Because then, you'll have nothing else to accomplish in life. Then, you'll be truely happy. <P>Not now. All I sense here is hate. Ignorance, and hate. Fear.)<P>What's this all about?  When we find our true love?  When we've achieved all that we want?  The world God gave us?<P>Talk about fear...whew!  You stink of it.  If you aren't a preacher you missed your calling my friend.  <P>You are reaching desperately hard for something and I don't think you know what.  Giving up eq does not = enlightenment, as you seem to think it does, or that you think you've accomplished by teaching us all your wisdom.  Giving up eq does not = happiness, does not = peace of mind, does not = stability or reliability or more friends or anything else. It may help some that are playing more than is healthy, but simply quitting is not the cure...that's like saying one who has lung cancer can quit smoking and the cancer will go away...sorry, doesn't work.  The problem has grown beyond the smoking now, just as the problem is not eq...eq may have been the trigger firing the bullet, but something else was the problem and your post to which 100's of people replied leads me to believe you are not yet aware of what ails you...you've only seen a symptom...eq.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003725.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=Everlore+Main+Hall&TopicSubject=To+Aerio+:+R.I.P.+preacherman.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#D9DCE8">

</FONT><HR>Aerio was right about how addictive some things can become, but almost everyone is addicted to something, and I'd even say addiction is a very natural human tendency.  How many people does everyone know who are addicted to sweets, coffee, television, or blaming others for their personal problems?  He was wrong that addiction is not normal.  It is very much the norm.  Most Americans are fat and watch too much TV.  Most of their kids too.  Where you draw the line is a personal affair, and bystanders scrutinizing it rarely have much of worth to say because they don't realize the value of the pay-offs the addict gets from his behavior; they only think of the downsides.  Like smoking, drinking coffee, or drinking beer, playing an online game or doing anything obsessively is a form of self-medication, and in a sense is doing a positive good for the indulger even despite any damage caused -- and that's exactly why it is done.  It's patronizing to say the addict can't control himself.  He simply has no reason to control himself that is more compelling than the rewards of the addiction.  Although American culture is no longer a culture wherein taking responsibility for one's actions is thought of as a great virtue, the truth is that addicts are not crazy; they are making decisions, generally spurred by very deep personal problems or egregious stupidity, and accepting the consequences because it seems the best bargain at the time.<P>For Aerio, the bargain no longer worked out.  The return did not justify the expenditure.  Addicts hit that wall at different times; some dead ones don't hit it except with death.<P>But it's very individual.  Aerio's conclusions about the terribleness of self-medicating via Everquest fall pretty short.  It's better than doing so with crack or booze, and much easier to quit.  And for some, it's the medication they need to get through life with more success than they would otherwise.  For others, it's just some fun, whether for long hours or short.  <P>So Aerio's writing can strike a chord with us because it is very human and we can recognize that, but it resonates more with the personal situations of some than others, because we are not all Aerio or like him.  It's not really a fair understanding of either addiction or of Everquest or game players in general.<P>And, unfortunately, I agree with some of the responders to this thread that Everquest, for Aerio, is likely a proxy for something else.  He got great rewards by ignoring his life for a long time, or he wouldn't have done it, because he had problems he couldn't deal with  except by escaping them.  Everquest let him deal with his life in the best way he knew how, but it could have been drugs or being a workaholic or almost anything; it probably hardly matters.  Giving up playing Everquest too much won't solve the underlying problems that led him to take it up so ferociously in the first place; unless he addresses those problems, he'll probably find some other destructive behavior.  And while clearing up a problem - or merely seeming to - can produce a honeymoon period, life goes on, and  those goofy flowery feelings of dancing through the tulips are kinda creepy, and fade, thank goodness.  Cuz if you need to be giddily, hippity-hoppity happy to be happy, or hope to sustain that, you've got a lot of growing up to do, and there may not be enough time in one lifetime. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003725.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=Everlore+Main+Hall&TopicSubject=To+Aerio+:+R.I.P.+preacherman.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#E8EAF0">
