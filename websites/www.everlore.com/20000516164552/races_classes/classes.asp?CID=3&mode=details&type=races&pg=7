				As one of, in my opinion, the least played classes the enchanter has certain advantages and disadvantages. At low levels they are probably the weakest offensive character, but from a fun and roleplaying<BR>
standpoint they have some cool abilities to utilize. At first get &quot;minor illusion&quot; immediately! it transforms you to the closest inanimate object ie. a house, a rug, a lamp, a cactus etc... sound useless? <BR>
you can still cast and fight but not move, it does however have the advantage of not being attacked while resting. This give you the opportunity to regain HP's and mana anywhere without fear of attack. It <BR>
is also great for pranks! Also if you want to travel at low levels enchanters get a great combination early on. Invisiblity and Gate can both be bought at 4th level. Allowing you to travel unmolested and <BR>
still return to your point of origin with no hassles. I have not advanced my enchanter high enough to know if the offense picks up in later levels but the illusions allow you to enter any city without fear <BR>
being killed by gaurds... sometimes looking like the enemy aint to shabby! well good luck fellow enchanters!

				At level 8, Enchater's get a spell called &quot;Chaotic Feedback&quot;, which will do 43 points of damage initialy, plus 1 point for every level above 8. Quite a nice spell.  The benefits of their ability to become other races are wonderful as well.  Just think. Become a half-elf, gain infravision. Need to regenerate? Become a troll.  By far, this class can be the wildcard of a party, and add lots of fun.

				Enchanter could be a lot of fun, if you know how to utilize every single spells you get.  Their Pet is not bad, having someone to help you kill something is pretty good.<BR>
You will find that your pet will hit more often and harder than you.  But I recommend that you get the biggest/baddest Animation spell you could get.  When I hit level 4, I couldn't afford the Juli's Animation spells and the fightwas<BR>
very tedious and hard.  As soon as I bought that spell, I could do 8-9 combats, taking on Sperlings (they gang up), until they were are clear from the area.  Remember to buff yourself and your pet, Minor Shielding, Haze, Strength.<BR>
When you could afford it, get invis, gate, and fear.  People will love you to help them get their corpse back with invis.  The Shocking Spears and Color Flux could wait.  They eat too much Mana and does not do too much.  Once you hit level 5, <BR>
you will noticed that most stuffs do not give you exp anymore, the White mobs are hard to come back and they gang up(Kobold Scouts).  But if it's an easy kill, I recommend that you still kill those mobs that give you good coins (sperling, kobold runts and decaying gnomes/skeleton)<BR>
You could get an average of 2-3 silvers per kill.  That's a lot of money, especially when each spells for level 4 are 4g4s.  Try not to let your pet tank, they'll die way too fast.  It's better that it helps you hit.  More info, as I gather them.<BR>

				Some additional observations since posting 'Enchanter's Advice':<BR>
On animations, the effectiveness of your pet is only as good as<BR>
the spell level is close to your own level, so upgrade and you<BR>
will reap the benefits.  Animation pets behave erratically in<BR>
dungeons, 'pacing', getting lost and pulling back more trouble<BR>
than it may sometimes seem they are worth.<BR>
While illusion spells will help overcome racial prejudices, they<BR>
do not affect faction in general.  I question why someone who<BR>
doesn't recognize me under illusion would know my religion or deeds,<BR>
but that is the reality that has been handed to us, probably to <BR>
encourage the use of faction-affecting spells.<BR>
The first Evocation spell that enchanters get isn't until level 8,<BR>
Chaotic Feedback.  As a result, one of the most costly spells in<BR>
terms of mana for a young enchanter will fizzle much more often than<BR>
cast successfully, so training in evocation may be something to <BR>
consider.  This is the main direct damage spell for some time, so<BR>
your develop your evocation skill accordingly, or practice on green<BR>
creatures until you cast more successes than fizzles.

				   Enchanters initially are the weakest of all spellcasters.  Their focus is Alteration, and all alteration spells cast on creatures have a chance of being resisted.  This means unlike an Evocation spell, when you blast a monster with Sufficating Sphere there's a chance (depending on comparitive levels between you and the monster) the spell will be resisted for absolutely no effect.  And the monster will be angry at you!<BR>
   However behind this weakness lies the little known fact that Enchanters may well be the most powerful spellcaster of all.  At a casual glance the Sufficating Sphere, a level 4 enchanter spell, inflicts a mere 10 damage - if it's not resisted.  Compared the Magician and Wizard spells at level 4 it's about equivilent damage-wise but is neither area affect nor unable to be resisted.  Now cast it on yourself and watch your hitpoints... 10 damage initially but then the damage just keeps going!  Before the Sufficating sphere spell has worn entirely off, it has inflicted no less than *40* damage, and lowered your stats while it was in affect on you - and your just a level 4 enchanter when you cast it!<BR>
   While this is good, the attack spell resistance hurdle is still a tough one to deal with, but fortunately Enchanters gain Chaotic Feedback at level 8, and it's Evocation.  (Unfortunately it's the very first enchanter evocation spell so you'll have to practice it alot before you can cast it reliably without it fizzling.)  Chaotic Feedback inflicts damage that matches the best level 8 Wizard and Magician direct damage spells, so all is well in the Enchanter direct damage world.<BR>
   This is just the tip of the iceburg, however, as Enchanters also get to mess with monster minds.  One of the most expencive but very handy spells you will gain at level 4 is Fear.  This spell allows you to almost always (baring interuption) scare off a monster you are fighting so you can get a head start on a getaway.  Later Whirl Till You Hurl makes a monster sit and spin, and is said to be much more effective than Root.  Chase the Moon is likely an improved verison of fear, perhaps allowing you to make a much longer escape.    This and a variety of other spells can make an Enchanter equally as handy to have in a party as a Wizard.  For example, if that bandit is about to kill off your party, you can scare it away and buy your party time to escape - all a wizard or magician could do is try to kill the bandit like everybody else.<BR>
    The enchanter's non combative abilities aren't bad either.  Enchanters can enchant ore so they can be made into magicial ones (a spell only purchasable in the Dark Elven city it is rumored), they can create the illusion they are another race (allowing you to walze into unfriendly cities), they can turn invisible and see invisible at the earliest level of all classes (lvl 4), and many other handy affects.  This is not to say your the king of utility as an enchanter, but it cirtainly leaves you a few handy options for cirtain situations (mostly public relations).

				As an enchanter who has gone up a few levels, and has played a few other classes since beta, I wish to pass on my words of wisdom. First off I will not try to paint a pretty picture, enchanters ARE the hardest class in the game to play, and that is reflected by the number of people that actually play the class. As a level on enchanter I recommend getting minor illusion first off, as this allows you to rest anywhere without being disturbed by monsters want to gnaw on low level players. While level 4 or lower try spending yer time in the newbie playgrounds honig your skills on those decaying skeletons and whatever else is in that zone in the level 1-3 monster range. Upon reeaching level 4 get these spells in this order, juri's animation, haze, suffocating sphere, and invisibility. The enchanter pets tend to be very weak compared to other classes but they are not without thier uses. Even though Pendrils' animation pet spell makes a 10 hitpoint pet, juris is a little bit tougher and can tank a bit when in a fight. This allows you to get off an attack spell or two before the mosnter homes on on you. As an enchanter I can't stress the importance of being in a group! soloing as an enchanter, even at higher levels, is suicidal. The reason for this is that we are great at buffing our group members, debuffing monsters, and stunning/rooting monsters. Not to say enchanters can't blast, but when you compare at level 20 enchanters have only 2 direct damage spells, level 8 chaotic feedback that does max 48 damage for 55 mana and level 16 sanity warp that does max 96 damage for 75 mana, that cause a monster to go into an instant frenzy its best to leave the blasting to the other casters in the group. This never really evens out but the best thing about being an enchanter is its hard to steal kills from an enchanter in a group. This is all thanks to a spell called charm. Ever been in a spot where its pretty much free for all but the one high powered group or individual there is killing everything? No problem charm the monster that you want to kill and grab your group and run to a spot where no one is at. When charm wears off you and your group and finish off that monster with ease! Best of all since charmed monsters are considered pets, anyone else who is trying to blast a charmed monster is wasting ALOT of thier mana trying to kill something they cannot. Also upon reaching level 16 get the illusion tree form as it is very very useful. Its basically an invisibility spell in open areas that doesn't have a random duration. The only word of caution with illusion tree or other inanimate object spells is that on steep hills or by zones there is a tendancy to &quot;fall' through the map. Normally when this happens you are teleported to the nearest safe spot in the zone you are currently in, but on occasion, the enchanter will fall to his/her death for 10000 damage. If anyone has any questions about the enchanter class and how to better play it please feel free to email me.

				Taking Big Mobs&#8230; Enchanter-Style<BR>
For enchanters level 4 and up<BR>
<BR>
Being an enchanter in Norrath can be difficult. We don&#8217;t have big burn spells like wizards. We don&#8217;t get smart pets like necros and magicians. We can&#8217;t even heal. Some enchanters have said that we need more enhancements to be an effective class. I say&#8230; when used right, with the right tactics and the right party, our unique abilities are extremely powerful and are a HUGE asset to a group trying to take out a big mob. Here&#8217;s a strategy I&#8217;ve found that allows me and my group to take out mobs that are way too difficult for other parties our level. <BR>
<BR>
Let&#8217;s say your party finds an area with several baddies in it. Using ordinary run-in-and-bash tactics, you&#8217;d have to fight the whole mob at once. But with the enchanter&#8217;s Soothe and Mesmerize spells (or Lull, Enthrall, etc. depending on your level), you can fight them one or two at a time. I like to think myself as the traffic cop of the party&#8212;I tell the monsters when to STOP, and when to GO.<BR>
<BR>
Okay, so your group has staked out the area you want to take. There are 3-6 baddies of an appropriate level, and they&#8217;re scattered around a room or a camp. You&#8217;ll want to fight the closest ones first, for reasons that will be apparent in a minute. Announce to your party the order in which you want to fight them. For example, say &#8220;Left front woman bandit, then right front woman bandit.&#8221; Your party targets the first one and waits for you and the designated &#8220;puller&#8221; to call them in. <BR>
<BR>
Make sure your party is ready, then Soothe the BACK monsters (furthest from party) and make it quick. As soon as you&#8217;ve got 2 or 3 soothed, say &#8220;GO&#8221; and have the designated person PULL the targeted baddie with a spell or range weapon. When this works, i.e. when your Soothe takes, the front baddies run to your party and the back ones sit there patiently until you&#8217;re ready for them. <BR>
<BR>
A couple points here: If you soothe the front baddies and call the back ones, the front ones wake up when the back ones run through them. Also, make sure your party is far enough from the remaining mob that they won&#8217;t join in when they awake.<BR>
<BR>
So now let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re fighting a group of six, with three soothed and three on your party. Here&#8217;s where the power of an enchanter really comes in. Your well-trained party knows to use the /assist command to assist your &#8220;designated hitter&#8221; (usually our biggest tank), so they&#8217;re all attacking ONE of the THREE baddies on your group. You, as the enchanter, now click madly on the pile of baddies bashing your group to select one that&#8217;s not being hurt. Use Mesmerize to put that one to sleep. Your party is now taking damage from only TWO of the three. Mez the other baddie not being hit. Now your party can now easily finish off the ONE left fighting. <BR>
<BR>
Now you step back and keep an eye on things. If any new critters join the fight, mez them quickly. You can cast Suffocating Sphere (choke) on the one the party is killing, though this shouldn&#8217;t be necessary and it&#8217;s best to save your mana for mez. <BR>
<BR>
An interesting point: When a creature is soothed or mezzed, it can be safely debuffed without waking it. So, if you&#8217;ve time and mana and a big ol&#8217; mezzed monster, cast Tashan, Languid Pace, some form of Weaken, or whatever else you&#8217;ve got handy on the critter. When it wakes, your party will be amazed at how easy that big ol&#8217; monster was.<BR>
<BR>
Next, the first baddie finally dies. The party looks around to see the other ones mezzed and waiting patiently. The designated hitter starts in on one and the party joins in. The third creature should wake up shortly, so keep an eye on it.<BR>
<BR>
Important point: Make sure your party understands the need to attack THE SAME TARGET. If everyone in your party is thumping on a different creature, your powers of Mez are useless because a mezzed creature wakes up the instant someone hits it or casts a damage spell on it. Also, make sure your spellcasters know NOT to use area attack spells or group damage spells for the same reason.<BR>
<BR>
That&#8217;s the basic strategy. It&#8217;s beautiful when it works, but sometimes things go terribly wrong. When that first or second soothe fails horribly, you&#8217;ve suddenly got 5 or 6 monsters in your lap. We fragile enchanters can&#8217;t take much bashing. In this situation, your party needs to GET THEM OFF YOU. They need to get in a couple hits on everything to distract them from you. The healer, assuming you&#8217;ve got one, needs to keep you alive. Once the critters are back on the rest of your party, back away from the mob. At this time you&#8217;ll have a couple bubbles of HP and be full of mana. <BR>
<BR>
Now your party needs to concentrate their attack by assisting the designated hitter. Then start mezzing like crazy and the baddies shouldn&#8217;t bother you any more. I find it also quite helpful to have my own &#8220;guardian angel&#8221;. This person watches over me. If a spell doesn&#8217;t take and pulls one of the critters to me, my angel whacks it a couple times to get its attention, then returns to the designated hitter&#8217;s target, knowing that I will mez that naughty critter right quick. <BR>
<BR>
When the battle is going and the corpses start dropping, loot the first one as soon as it falls. When the second falls, leave it a bit before looting. The tactic here is to spread the spawn. You want to loot them far enough apart that you could kill one between loots. Now, instead of having to perform the heroic battle vs. 6 creatures every time, you can take them one at a time as they spawn. <BR>
<BR>
The wonderful thing about this strategy is that if the party is fighting only one creature at a time, you&#8217;re dishing out a whole lot more damage, more stuns and bashes, and the creature can barely manage to get any hits in. Those previously nasty casters can hardly get a spell off. It&#8217;s like taking your group from one single baddie to another, but you don&#8217;t have to travel for it. <BR>
<BR>
Regarding the education of your companions&#8230; some can learn, some can&#8217;t. Find people who understand and enjoy this strategy and group with them. It&#8217;s easier to convince new party members when the whole party agrees that this is the ONLY way to go. It&#8217;s amazing how this can spoil the people you party with. They&#8217;ll get used to taking big tough mobs with you, then try the same mobs with a mass battle tactic and everyone will perish. <BR>
<BR>
It&#8217;s a work of art when everyone knows his or her part and it&#8217;s done right. Try it out and help spread the word. It&#8217;s tough trying to educate the masses when many of our own class don&#8217;t know how powerful an enchanter can be. <BR>
<BR>

				I am what one would call a newbie? Nahh... level 19 ehchanter<BR>
charm is a great spell fighting orcs anywhere in Norrath.<BR>
For example go to a camp where there are three orcs or even two.<BR>
Charm the orc that is the closet to you and run to the orc and let him<BR>
hit you just once.  Since you can not control your pet the pet or charmed <BR>
enemy is just there to protect you.  He will have no choice but to help you fight.<BR>
Make sure you tell your party your charming because if you at charm and your party does not know<BR>
they will try to kill him and he wont die.  The enemy is now your pet you can not have two pets so whatch out<BR>
do not charm when you have a pet already.<BR>
Then sit back and watch eachother fight until he is dead from the other enemy or when he breaks the spell<BR>
this is the so cool when ur are in a train or have more than u can handle<BR>
anatsia &lt;WoR&gt;<BR>
see you in norrath
