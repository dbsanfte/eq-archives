			<font face="verdana" size="2" color="black">Paladin Armor of Ro:  The paladins in the paladin camp will tell you how to acquire the armor of Ro, a high quality paladin-only armor.  It is currently under debate whether you need the blacksmithing skill to do the quest.  You do need to develop a high faction with each of the paladin guilds to get all of the armor.  You will only get the quests from those who view you warmly.  Below are the methods of getting the molds for each item.  All molds are no drop lore items, so whoever turns in the items must finish the quest.  You need to take the mold to Lord Searfire, the Dwarven Smith in The Temple of Solusek Ro, to get the item made.  He must consider you warmly before he will deal with you.  He talks about using a new metal called ronium to forge the items and supposedly will sell it to you if your faction is high enough.  It is not certain if he makes it himself or if you make it through the blacksmith skill in his forge. <BR>
<BR>
Helm of Ro:  Given by Paladin Thomas.  Faction needed with Temple of Thunder in Qeynos [Knights of Thunder].  If you are not given the quest outright, go ask someone (not sure who) in the Temple if you have proved your nobility and if he answers yes, you have good enough faction to do the quest.  Bring him 2 skulls from the undead cyclopses (plains of thunder/Karana) and he will reward you with the mold for the helm. <BR>
Gauntlets of Ro:  Given by Sentry Joanna.  Faction needed with the Temple of Marr in Freeport [Priests of Marr].  If you are not given the quest outright, go ask Gygus Remnara at the Temple if you are an [honored member] and if he answers yes you have good enough faction for the quest.  Bring her the locket from Sentry Alechin of Qeynos (get when he is werewolf form at night - may be called Grimtooth) and she will reward you with the mold for the Gauntlets. <BR>
Greaves of Ro:  Given by Paladin Elisabeth [Half Elf Paladin].  Faction needed with the Hall of Truth in Freeport [Knights of Truth].   If you are not given the quest outright, go ask High Lord Dushire at the Hall am [I an honored member], and if he says yes you have good enough faction for this quest.  Bring her a head from a Nightfall Giant (West Commonlands - spawns at the druid ring right at nightfall) and she will reward you with the mold for the greaves. <BR>
Breastplate of Ro:  Given by Paladin Abigail.  Faction needed with the Clerics of Tunare in Felwithe.  If you are not given the quest outright, go ask the leader of the church in Felwithe if you are a [honored member] and if he says yes you can do this quest. Bring her 2 Dark Cauldrons (from the cooks in Mistmoore) and she will give you the mold for the breastplate. <BR>
Vambraces of Ro:  Given by Paladin Marianna.  Faction  needed wtih the Temple of Life in Qeynos [Priests of Life]. If you are not given the quest outright, go ask High Priestess Jhanda am [I an honored member] and if she says yes you have good enough faction to do this quest.  Bring her 2 rotten shark portions (diseased shark skins?) from plague sharks (oceans around Qeynos Hills/not in Eruds crossing) and she will reward you with the mold for the vambraces. <BR>
Bracers of Ro:  Given by Paladin David [Erudite Paladin].  Faction needed with the Erudite Paladin's Guild [Deepwater Knights].  Bring him two Goblin Nets from the elusive goblin net masters/deepwater goblin netmasters (the waters of Lake Rathe) and he will reward you with the Bracer Mold. <BR>
Boots of Ro:  Given by Paladin Nicolas [Dwarf Paladin].  Faction needed with the Dwarf Paladin's Guild [Miners Guild 249].  Bring him the plans for the Brazen Brass Kilij from a Sand Giant in South Ro and he will reward you with the mold for the boots. <BR>

				According to previous posts on this discussion database Grimtooth spawns in north Karana.  I have yet to see him nor have I met anyone who have seen him for 3 weeks.<BR>
I heard that the &quot;diseased shark&quot; are from the sewers of Qeynos.<BR>
So far, these quests are quite aggitating since the information we have been given is so vague.  Add to the fact that if we do indead need to forge our own armour it makes it next to impossible for the other 96% of the paladins who have no blacksmithing skill.  There's the whole faction situation.  I don't care what the other classes have to say but ours seems to be the most tedious of them all.<BR>
If you have any information and facts about these quests please post them here.  I hope for the sake of all questers that it's not as bad as I see it.

				I talked with Lord Searfire in the Temple of Solusek Ro. He has told me that the Paladin must make his own armor. I assume he means that it will be no drop. He said that Ro want's his paladins do be blacksmiths as well. He also told me that to create the items you will need one sheet of metal, the mold and one flask of water. The big problem I seem to have is with faction. I just spent the weekend trying to raise my faction with the High Elves. I began the weekend with amiable faction (do to the fact that I have done the Princess Layna quest in Highpass Keep three times). Well after completing the Nybright quest three times, the D'Vinn heart quest four times, the orc runner quest four times and the bone chip quest ten times my faction has not changed. I find this fairly ridiculous. How much will I need to do with the guilds that I have indifferent faction with (like the dwarves)? Will I be running newbie quests for the rest of the year? Is this armor really worth that? I have yet to see any stats on the items in question. I am not even sure I have warm faction with my own guild in Freeport and I have the Testiment of Kighthood from there and am about half done with the Soulfire quest. Well I am just wndering if anyone has some suggestions on how I might raise my faction with the Elves and the other guilds that I do not know or have not though of. The idea of running around killing skunks in Butcher's Block does not thrill me.<BR>

				Well I can tell you that there are only 3 things that can raise your faction with the Dwarven Paladin guild in Kaladim. bone chips, aviak chick talons (not many running around BB newbie area) and returning the remains of Cromil. I do agree though that the quests for our armor seem to be very in-depth and tedious, but I personally find it very exciting. We are going to have to keep each other informed on any new information found out. I already screwed up and talked to the Prince in the basement of the Temple of Ro and my faction with the temple went down. Is there anyway to raise your faction with the Temple of Ro? Please let me know. Good luck fellow paladins!<BR>

I waited for 2 entire game days but he never turned so along with a lvl 34 wizard, we killed him.  He conned red to me but blue to the wiz.  After killing him, I was surprised to see that my faction got worse with the knights of truth and priests of marr but it got better w/ the freeport militia.  I am a paladin and I am anxious to know how much faction was changed when killing him - I haven't been to my guild yet to see how they look at me - it used to be kindly - hopefully, it is atleast amiably... anyway, i looted him, got some words, an FS rapier, and a locket... I'm hoping this is the locket for the gauntlets quest.  Any info would be well appreciated.<BR>

PS: The sentry was very tough - double attacked for 100+ and almost killed the wiz but I used lay hands on him.  Also, the sentry is NOT in north karanas, west karanas, east karanas but is in south karanas... he walked back and forth from near the bridge to the aviak house.. good luck, fellow paladins

				Darnoth, you have done a very bad thing. From what I understand the faction hit with Ro you get from hailing him is -50. There are only two ways that I know of to increase your faction with Ro. Killing dervishes and turning in four rings to Ortallius the named orc in South Ro. He is along the west zone wall. Second way I know is killing shadowed men. Something I am hard pressed to do at my level. That is another thing the does bothers me a bit. Before the last patch I had been preforming the dervish ring quest. At my level then it was good experience and fairly good loot from both the dervishes and Ortallius. I did have an amiable faction with Ortallius but now he views me indifferently. ARGH!! So back to the camps for more rings, I can asure all that I only camp them when there is no one else around. Actually have gotten into an argument now with some players in their teens, who walked up on me, about my camping the dervishes in South Ro. They are telling me I have no business there being 21, at that level you can still get experience from about 50% of the dervishes though not much. Well I think that I will put this quest on the back burner for awhile. Good luck to all involved and if are on the Innoruuk server and you get a full set of the armor send Annja a tell I'd like to see what it looks like.

				I will like to add i thing about making faction with temple of solusek RO. In mistmoore, in the graveyard there is a crypt with a NPC shadow man behind it. To get better faction go in the crypt take the flower that is in there ( it spawn every minute or so) then give the flower to the shadow men. Your faction will be better with solusek ro.<BR>
