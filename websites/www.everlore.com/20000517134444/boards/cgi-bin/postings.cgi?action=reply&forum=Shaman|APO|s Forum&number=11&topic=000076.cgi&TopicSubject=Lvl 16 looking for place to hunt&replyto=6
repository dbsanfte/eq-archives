[B]Hunt at oasis by the NRO zone wall.  If you get in trouble, just zone.  Madmen, orcs and tarantulas are good there.  I went there at 16 and left at 20.  Great exp and some of those orcs carry bronze.  You can find people to group with right there.  Everybody loves a shaman :)

While you hunt in Oasis you will have to set up residency in Freeport.  While there, occasionally hunt wisps in East Commons.  Don't sell the greater lightstones to those guys offering 5 plat for them.  Save them, and when you have a bagful, sow yourself and head to North Karana.  Take the road after the big wood bridge where the zone is and at the crossroads hang a left to the gypsy camp.  See the gypsy named Mylana or something and "Give her a Greater Lightstone".  She will give you a box that you will immediately sell to the gypsy to her right for 8 pp if you have the "Spirit of the Snake" buff on. Repeat procedure for each Greater Lightstone.

After you finish selling your bag or two of greater lightstones, you will have enough to buy that Glowing Wooden Crook :)[/B][/QUOTE]

The last few lvl's I spent at Erud's Crossing(Wisp Island) killing willow wisps for cash, and Black Burrow camping the knoll high shaman's room in a group. Since this is my first character, I know not where to go next. I made an attempt at hunting mammoths in everfrost with a group, but the group fell apart when we could not find enough kills to keep us occupied. I also tried heading to Split Paw with a group...big mistake, the group fell apart when ppl started to die(there is no place to bind close to Split Paw...). I've wasted over 12 hours just trying find someplace to hunt and ended up dying enough to actually set me back experience.  <IMG SRC="http://www.everlore.com/boards/EL/frown.gif"> Right now all I am looking for is someplace low risk to hunt with a small group(hopefully in the open, after spending countless hours hunting/running from trains in that hell hole called Black Burrow. Also at this time I really don't have a tight group to hunt with(all my old hunting partners I have surpased in lvl), so I am looking for some place where I can also join a new group without to much trouble. I would greatly appreciate any advice.  <IMG SRC="http://www.everlore.com/boards/EL/smile.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Sindaena</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Hey, <P>Try Misty Thicket, I think I read somewhere that it's the ideal place.

Both are over on the elve's island.  Couple requirements however, you'll need to group.  Things do too much damage for you to tank anymore if you're a Barbarian.  Ghouls & mummies in Unrest both require a magical weapon to hit.  Other things to hunt are Dark bones, tormented dead - if you're will a really good group (19s-16s) you can take most everything from werebats down.  Excellent xp and loot as well.  SOW makes hunting in both Crushbone and Unrest easier on us than many others.<BR>- Fenira, Barbarian Shaman of 16 seasons</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Caminari</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana"><BR>I hunted in Lavastorm until around 17 or 18.  Excellent loot and good experience as well.  A shaman can solo well here as every creature in Lavastorm has poor cold resistance, and all of our DD spells are cold based.  Also, one can make a pretty platinum up there with SOW's and Endure Fire buffs on other players.  After 18, I spread myself around the Beholders Maze, South Karanas, and Lake Rathe until 21.  Now I find myself mostly in Unrest.<P>I don't know if I would recommend hunting Unrest until maybe level 19+.  Not because you cannot kill anything there, but more because at less than level 20, the tormented dead, death beetles and greater skeletons (aptly named 'yard trash' by the regulars of unrest) will not ignore you as they do for higher levels.  Not good when healers are trying to get spells off and a death beetle, even if they only do 10 damage, is gnawing on his leg.  I went there also around level 16, and found the constant attacks of death beetles and tormented dead very tedious, as they give very little xp and loot and take about 10 minutes of garbage time after every fight.  At 21 though, I find hunting Unrest loads of fun, with much loot and xp to go around for all, and only occaisional encounters with Yard Trash.<P>------------------<BR>Caminari<BR>Level 21 Barbarian Shaman<BR>Quellious<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Ammon</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">I have been hunting in Oasis of mar from 14-17. I find that the loot is poor, but the exp is most excellent. Here is where you will want to find a monk to tank for you, and buff the heck out of him and then start blasting. Orc Priests are diffucult because they heal them selves, and more than one priest in a melee can prove very challenging depending on the size of your group. Another good reason to hunt here is becuase you can get some of your spells from the Gypsie camp in Oasis. Happy Hunting.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Dragidar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Actually, I have to agree with Caminari. I am a 16th level barbarian shaman and found that hunting that yard trash in Unrest a difficult task. There has been one to many nights where a Spirit Strike spell was used to pull a Jack-o-lantern, which in turn snagged three or four death beetles that were just off to the side....and in the end had all of the beetles con green. So, actually we lost our wizard and almost our ranger just for the exp of the jack, since the DB's didn't give any. This swarm does not stop at the beetles though, I have had my tank killed while puling a tormented dead because four or five spanwed right behind him as he was bringing the first back to camp. My advice? Be careful. Me and my group left for the throne room of Castle crush, and are waiting until level 19-21 to return to the Unrest Estate.<P><BR>Dragidar<BR>Shaman of the 16th season<BR>Mithanial Marr</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Vonia Stormweaver</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Hunt at oasis by the NRO zone wall.
