			<font face="verdana" size="2" color="black">Greetings all Halas Barbarians and travelers.<BR>
<BR>
I recently discovered a cave guarded by Ice Goblin Divers.  Upon entering, I discovered Ice Boned Skeletons and an NPC Necromancer that was less than happy to have me as company (ie, he was KOS to me).  I was wondering if anyone else has discovered this cave and if there's anything they can add about it.  I don't know if this is part of a quest, but I've heard various rumors as to it's purpose.  I'll share what I've heard below:<BR>
<BR>
1) This rumor I heard from an experienced player.  He stated that it appears it will be an entrance to one of the new alternate planes being implimented in an upcoming update.  He doesn't know what plane, but thinks the Plane of Hate would be most likely.<BR>
<BR>
2) This rumor I heard from a random player.  He stated that it's likely to be a future dungeon entrance that he thinks will be packed with high level undead.  I doubt this one, as there's already one that I know of (Unrest).<BR>
<BR>
3) This is my guess based on a piece of Norrathian history and I read on the Everquest homepage (read the history section called &quot;The Erudites, Necromancy, and the rise and fall of Miragul&quot; and what I've seen for myself.  Basicly, this piece of history gives a rather brief biography on a powerful Erudite named Miragul who was obsessed with arcane knowledge from all fields of magic.  In his old age he focused heavily on Necromancy to find a way to cheat death and live forever to continue amassing knowledge.  He finally found a way to become a Lich and transformed himself into one.  However, he made a mistake and the Lich retained all his power and abilities, but not the spirit or ambitions to continue amassing knowledge and power, so the Lich just roamed his secret headquarters.<BR>
<BR>
Ok, now that you have a brief history, this is where it all seems to fit into this Cave.  Miragul's lair is supposed to be in the far North, located in the Frigid Plain in an underground network of tunnels and rooms he created himself.  It is my best, educated guess with all the evidence I've read and seen, that this underwater cave might perhaps be Miragul's lair, or atleast an entrance to it.  This would account for all those ice-boned skeletons and the Necromancer, and given that there's so little info available, this is the best I can surmise.<BR>
<BR>
As I said, I'd like to see what everyone else thinks and has to say about this little known area of Everfrost.  I am thinking of getting a big group of adventurers together and make a brief raid/exploration venture to find out and make a map of this area.<BR>

				The cave is part of the new Cleric armor quest given in the Temple of Sol Ro.  There is a VERY large bear here and I do not remember what it is called but the cleric who gives the quest calls him the &quot;white beast&quot;. The bear is about level 30 (con blue to me at level 33) and not to difficult to kill.  He drops one of the ingots needed for the armor quest.  He roams around the caves and I believe has a long spawn rate of about 6 hours.  There is also the high level caster who is KOS to all...con red to me and did not mess with him, but he sits in the far back corner of one of the paths and is easy to spot and stay clear from.  Other then that, I have found nothing usefull in this cave except some Ice Bone Skells which would be good for 20ish level players.  I am sure there will be something else here in the future, but for now I have yet to see anything.

				Aha!  The new Shaman quests for armor involve a large bear there too.  It's a Glacier Bear, and us shamans need the Glacier Bear Pelt.  At least, I hope it's the same bear.  I haven't seen any glacier bears above ground, and I heard somewhere else someone saw a glacier bear in these caverns.  Why would Verant make it a 6 hour spawn if two classes need it for their armor tho?  Man, I can see a long wait ahead of me...

   The entranc to the cave is guarded by a couple of goblin divers..very easy to kill for a 16 Barb<BR>
   And there are in fact two rooms with Iced Boned Skeletons in them....one is the hut with the rod in it(it has three)...the other is fairly close to the wiz and has two IBS's guarding a teleporter that doesnt work  (yet!)<BR>
  It has been petitioned and a guide came out and looked at the teleporter...but was either unable or didn't know anything about why it doesn't work or where it goes.

				We went to this cave last night looking for the Glacier Bear for part of the Shaman armor quest.  We found the 2 ice bone skels (green to my lvl 21 partner) and the &quot;broken teleporter&quot;.  Thank goodness we did not see the NPC wiz.  Does anyone know where exactly the glacier bear spawns in there?  It is an awful big maze from what we saw.

				here is a repost from &quot;All of Norrath&quot;. it is about Miragul and the Lich, and it involes the 2 new zones (The Hole and Paineel) that are coming soon, as well as some others on the boxed map (Frigid Plain, Winter's Deep) that I hope will be instituded soon.<BR>
After reading this text, it is my opinion that the caves under the river (which are the northernmost point in norrath apart from halas) are indeed the way to Winter's deep and The Fridgid Plain. Winter's deep would probably the the body of water that the everfrost river empties out into on the other side (assuming the water is flowing beneath the network of caves). Miragul's trapped soul and the soulless Lich he created are trapped in the network of caves he magically constructed in the Fridgid Plain (north of Winter's Deep).&quot;Miragul, being a member of all four schools, was not blind to the implications when the conflict began. He left the heretics before they fled the city, abandoning his fourth identity and siding apparently with the council. But this was only a ruse in order to buy time. He soon gathered every artifact and tome he could discreetly steal and then left Odus entirely, taking a ship back to Antonica and to the city of Qeynos. The lands of men, however, were not only to his dislike, but also filled with Erudite spies. Miragul grew afraid, even paranoid, and soon fled again. He headed far to the north and then to the east, wishing to avoid the barbarians of Halas. After many weeks he found himself near the great lake called Winter&#8217;s Deep and he hid there for some time. <BR>
<BR>
While Miragul waited in secret his mind was not idle. He schemed and planned, and looked over every letter of every scroll and tome he had taken from Erudin. Time passed and his understanding and power grew. But he was unsatisfied and a deep hunger for even more arcane knowledge ate away at him. He soon left his hiding place and began to travel long distances in search of more ancient texts and artifacts. His power had grown and confidence overcame his fear of Erudite spies. Once again he cloaked himself in false identity and countenance and traveled the lands of men. <BR>
<BR>
Not far to the south of where his cache of artifacts lay, Miragul soon found another of the new races, the Halflings, and their town Rivervale. The mage feared these small people and their propensity to sneak and to steal, and as his treasures grew in both size and value, he eventually made the decision to move even farther north, and away from all intelligent life. He traveled leagues and leagues, far beyond the range of both Erudite spy and curious Halfling, and eventually came to a vast tundra. This land had no name, and was not until centuries later referred to as merely the Frigid Plain. This frosty and remote environment appealed to Miragul&#8217;s heart, for it had grown cold, obsessed with only knowledge and the abstract, and filled with only hatred for others. Creatures with intelligence forced him to be discreet and slowed his acquisition of knowledge and items. He had as little to do with them as he could, only hiding amongst them when absolutely necessary. <BR>
<BR>
Under the icy ground of the Frigid Plains, Miragul created a large network of tunnels and rooms in which to hide and study his collection. He used no labor, but rather deep magic to remove the earth from his way. Room after room, passage after passage, he did create to house his store of artifacts. He split his years, spending one score out in the world, exploring and amassing knowledge and items, returning them to his cache, and then the next dabbling with them, experimenting in one of several laboratories he had created. <BR>
<BR>
Many years passed, even centuries. Miragul grew old, even though he did his best to extend his life using magical means. There was a limit to his enlightenment when it came to aging, and he soon acknowledged that one day even he would die. Only one aspect of death did he fear, and being no longer able to learn and collect wrought him with terror. As his skin grew wrinkled, and his breath short, Miragul&#8217;s time was spent less exploring the world of Norrath and more studying the existential. He soon discovered the various hidden dimensions that neighbored his own, the Planes of Power and Discord. He discovered means by which he could traverse these planes, making portals that led between them. But his strength was leaving him, and his journeys into these realities were short and often unprofitable. More and more, his own mortality limited his reason for living, and the specter of death haunted him daily. <BR>
<BR>
The mage&#8217;s research into life and death was built upon a foundation he had learned from his fellow outcasts centuries before in Erudin. Necromancy, more than any other art, became Miragul&#8217;s obsession. Eventually he discovered a means by which to create portals within his own plane and made them to travel great distances in mere seconds. He traveled back to Odus, to its southern regions, in search of the other Necromancers. Perhaps, he mused, they had unearthed by now a way to cheat death. <BR>
<BR>
The mage soon found that the heretics of Erudin had built a city into a great hole that led to unknown depths beneath the earth. This chasm was apparently the result of that huge civil war from which Miragul had fled centuries earlier. The city, called Paineel, though somewhat suspicious, allowed Miragul to enter and after a time he earned its inhabitant&#8217;s trust. Many humored the old man and his claims, while a select few respected him and were willing to trade knowledge for knowledge, power for power. They revealed to him the true power of necromancy, the ability to raise the dead, creating zombies and wraiths obedient in every way to their master. Many of the heretics planned to assault Erudin with vast armies of undead, to wreak revenge upon the council that had exiled and made war upon them in centuries past. <BR>
<BR>
One important aspect of their necromancy interested Miragul, the fact that the undead ceased to age. Their lives appeared endless and the elderly mage knew that he must discover a way to be like them. He feigned interest in the heretic&#8217;s goals, learning spells to raise the dead, helping them raise their undead army. All the while, however, he was experimenting himself, hiding much of his research in the small home he was given in Paineel. After some time he discovered that which he had sought, a way to transform a living being, as opposed to a corpse, into the undead. Unfortunately, time was scarce, for he was tired and almost dead himself, his body deteriorating with age, and the heretics were almost ready to make war once again. <BR>
<BR>
Miragul then left Paineel, using a small portion of his dwindling life energies to make a portal back to his cache hundreds of leagues to the north. Upon arrival, he withdrew silently to his most secret laboratory and prepared his final spell. Dreaming all the while of endless exploration and discovery, he slowly made ready his ultimate experiment. The enchantment laced with necromancy was finally made, and Miragul hid his remaining and fragile life within the phylactery, a small device he had pilfered from the other necromancers. Clouds of mystical energy gathered and then dispersed, revealing a shell of the man Miragul once was, an undead mage, what ancient scripts and legends called a lich. <BR>
<BR>
In his haste, however, Miragul had made a miscalculation. The lich, while retaining all the mystical power of his formal self, lacked a spirit. Only the mage&#8217;s soul, now locked within the phylactery hidden deep in the cache, retained the ambition and desire to amass knowledge and power. The spiritless lich possessed none of these human traits, and Miragul&#8217;s soul screamed in silence as the undead creature began to aimlessly wander his menagerie of wisdom and enlightenment, his rooms filled with artifacts of power.&quot;<BR>
