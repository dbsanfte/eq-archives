<!--<tr><td><font face="verdana">This guide is not aimed for any specific class or race, i have used this tactic in all the races i have been, and consider myself an expert at power leveling considering im currently playing a lvl 12 cleric after only 2 days of playing it, this is how i start out, if you know your way around norath you should have no problem getting from your starting area to freeport or qeynos, either place is the best for starting levels, but what i recommend is starting in freeport because well that is what works good for me.  Anyway start out by killing rats in freeport till your about level 2 then you can take on fire beetles alone since they give great exp for lower levels.  then when your level 3 or four go out into the east commons killing wolves, black bears, spiderlings and whatever else is in there but stay clear from lions, and griffins cuz they will kill on sight.  Then when your level 5 or 6 go out into north ro and team up with a few people taking on tarantulas and scarabs, untill you can solo them, when you solo them. when your about level 9 travel to qeynos if you know the way and go to black burrow and kill giant snakes in the snake ledge/pit that is great exp and 4 snakes pop up at a time, that can get you to level 12, and after that you can explore all over, since im a cleric i went back to kill willowisps since they give greater lightstones and they equal around 5pp pvp selling and 3pp selling to merchants.  from there you can go to lots of different places im killing minos in the mino caves in steamfont mountains but that is something new for me and im not sure how good that is, but the rogue clockworks seem to give good exp and the mino slavers have mino axes which you can sell for 5 pp.</font></td></tr>-->
