<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by BigDrew:
[B]So, my wife's been playing EQ for a while, and I'm going to start playing soon. She spends a good deal of time fishing, and maxing out her fishing skill, so I have a question:

Why do people fish? From what I can see, you get one of 4 items: fresh fish, fish scales, sandals, and daggers. I can see that some of these might be useful for a low-level character, but once you are beyond lvl 4 or 5, it seems like hunting monsters would be a more effective use of your time. If you are a spell user and you want fish scales to swim underwater for extended periods, you can always buy some. So why do so many people fish in EQ? Actually, you could probably ask that question in the real world as well ;-P

I'm sure there's some benefit I just haven't thought of, so please enlighten me!

Thanks,

    Drew[/B][/QUOTE]

If your waiting for the ship to come its a godsend.  lets face it, sitting on the dock o the bay watching the tide roool away is boring as hell.  Fishing gets you skill and chow.  and you WILL one day eventually sit on the dock waiting for the damn ship.<P>2.  Its a cheap food source, and once your good it can be done very fast.<P>3. Cash.  Fish can be sold.  Once your skill level is up to around 80 you will catch in excess of 200 fish in an hour.  If you can bake, making baked fish, they sell for up near 4 silver.  Do the math here folks;<P>200 fish = (aprox) 300 baked fish fillets<P>300 x 4 silver = 1200 silver, 12 pp in an hour.<P>if your fishing and baking are both over 100 you can pull down even better numbers, and if your a Ranger and can forage for grubs, well, it gets better and better.<P>It IS boring, true.  But there is money to be made, thats why you see folks fishing after all.<P>Cinnabar<BR>Ranger of the 13th season<BR>Quellios</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">valkry</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">If you are in a zone w/ a body of water & need to rest to re-gain hit points or mana, you can sit & rest, or fish. I find a "friendly" NPC/pet & practice my begging, forage & practice my direction sense while fishing. I also camp for the evening while fishing & usually get a fish or 2 in my last 30 seconds of play. I very rarely buy food (umm raw fish again - yummy!), and am able to eat well & still have enough fish to learn the basics of cooking (fish-rolls)and enough rusty daggers to sharpen to get my smithing skill into the 20's.<P>The very first item I try to buy for a new charcter, is the fishing pole.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Lothlin</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">To take a stab at your other question, BigDrew,  Why do people fish in ? real life? and "time better spent at other activies".  Why do people do anything at all?  Because they want to.  Because they can.  Sure, they might go out and earn enough to advance their level.  They might take a job to earn more money.  (Do you have any idea of where this is headed?)  They might start up some little business.  Making Role-Playing games.  So people like us can sit at our computers playing them.  Which to to me, is a very nice way to spend time.<P>To re-ask your question, Hey, BigDrew, why are YOU playing EQ?  Why aren't you out fishing and earning more money to support your family?<P>(By the way, when my own spouse concludes the present university-year and graduates, the two of us will finally have a chance to adventure together in EQ.  I'm not attacking you in this posting, I'm envying you!)<P>Lothlin, the pining Druid of the 10th, Innoruuk   (just couldn't resist that one)<P>[This message has been edited by Lothlin (edited 10-16-1999).]<p>[This message has been edited by Lothlin (edited 10-16-1999).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Gruntz</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">I have a Dark Elf Necro on ECI who fishes purely because buying anything is difficult for him..if I do find an NPC who won't kill me the prices are outrageous..cant do much about water..just have to stock up whenever possible but fishing for food is a godsend  <IMG SRC="http://www.everlore.com/boards/EL/smile.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Freth</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">I fish for baking purposes, and to pass time waiting for the boat.  The above figures for fish fillets are wrong.  You get two fish fillets per 1 fresh fish and 1 jug o'sauces.  This doubles your output.  Take away 5-10% of the fresh fish due to baking failures and you end up with approx 380 fish fillets which you can sell for 5sp 3cp per (1pp 6sp for a stack)---this varies depending on what merchant you sell to and your standing there.  19pp altogether (minus your pole/bait/jug o'sauces cost)... 18pp profit.<p>[This message has been edited by Freth (edited 11-20-1999).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Abinu</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Hmm.. most has already been said, but i try to make a short summary what you can do while fishing:<BR>1. resting for hitpoints<BR>2. regenerating mana<BR>3. improve language skills<BR>4. improve sense heading skill<BR>5. improve begging skill<BR>6. do tailoring, fletching, jewellery or cooking, if you have the appropriate kit (or spit) with you<BR>7. give information to others (especially to newbies)<BR>8. ask for information on your own<BR>9. auction off surplus loot or selfmade stuff<BR>10. improve casting skill with seldom used spells<P>or<P>just enjoy the dawn!<P>If somebody has new ideas, feel free to post them.
