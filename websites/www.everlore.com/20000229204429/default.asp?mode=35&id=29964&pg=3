			<font face="verdana" size="2" color="black">Well this is part on the New Class specific Quests.  It looks very indepth so be prepared to spend lots of time on these.  First you must go to the Paladin Camp in Rathe Mountains.  There a different Paladin will give you information on each of the different pieces of armor.  They will say you seek the Sacred Mold.  I recieved 2 Quests because I have good faction in Qeynos and freeport.  The others said I must become an [Honored Member} and once i was told I was an honored member to return for my Quest.  So, as you can see there will be a lot of Faction raising time spent.  These quests are going to require a lot of travel, the follwoing is a list of the Item and area theQuest is in or whp you have to raise faction with.<BR>
HELM - Temple of Thunder (Qeynos)alls I was told was to go here?<BR>
BREASTPLATE - Clerics of Tunare (Felwithe)this one said Ihad to be an [Honored Member]<BR>
VAMBRACES - Temple of Life (Qeynos)<BR>
I am suppose to return with 2 rotton shark portions to get the MOLD. Q Hills was mentioned as a lead but I have no idea where i would find a shark in Q hills. It said the meat was plaguing the countryside there, I checked the vendors but nothing, and the small lake was empty as well? I was told that there was a diseased shark in Erudin by the docks so I went there.  He atcked me as soon as I jumped in the water but couldn't hit me.  I managed to kill him to about 20% then he swam off and I couldn't catch him. I waited but he didn't spawn again for at least 2 hours. I will try this again just to eliminate the possibility or confirm it.<BR>
GREEVES - Freeport countryside. I have to kill a Nightfall Giant and rreturn with his head for the MOLD.  A friend of mine said he saw one in West Commons so I am going to assemble a group to try and slay one of these.  Have no Idea what lvl they are.<BR>
GAUNTLETS - Temple of Marr.  I must have Gygus Remnara answer yes to the question that I am an [Honored Member]<BR>
BOOTS - The little short guy at the pally camp,a Halfling I belive told me to leave I wasn't worthy or something. Mentioned something about Clerics of Underfoot. I guess I need a ton of faction here.<BR>
BRACERS - Erudin Paladin Didn't Like me either. So no clue here either.<BR>
I am a lvl 26 Paladin and have traveled to most of these places mentioned above, I saw a much higher paladin at the Paladin camp in Rathe MNTS and again in Qeynos. she was more lost than I so any info on any of these Quests will be helpful.  I fear that once I return with one of these items I will get this Mold but than there will be much more to do to actualy get the peice of armor.

			Rain, the faction you need to turn in the Nightfall Giants head is with the Knights of Truth (Paladin guild in Freeport). But, I highly doubt you'd be able to finish the quest all the way through. The mold you get is no drop, and I'm not sure if Lord Searfire will give you the quest for Ronium if your not a Paladin.<BR>
<BR>
Ok, for everyone who likes to complain about our Ro armor let me point something out. The AC on this armor is as high as a Paladin can get until he can get to the PoH and get Valorium. Also, the stat bonuses on them are fairly good (+26 wis if you have a full suit) and adds to each of your resistances.<BR>
Yes, it is generally agreed upon that Ro armor is the toughests to get of all the class armors, but very few of the quests for Paladins are easy.<BR>
In short, if you don't like it, don't do the quests.<BR>

			REPRIEVE!<BR>
Hello all interested Paladins,<BR>
I have completed two pieces of The Armor of Ro quest! The Breastplate of Ro, and the Greaves of Ro, are now mine! *does a little dance* And I bring you good news, and bad news, and some clarification on some REALLY erroneous posts about the Armor of Ro. <BR>
<BR>
First the good news; if you have your basics covered (been a good paladin and have made plenty of friends, got your masters in smithing, and got your faction appropriate) this quest isn't nearly as hard as it appears (although it is time consuming).<BR>
<BR>
Now, the bad news: a 50th level anything (except maybe a druid) could no solo this quest throught it's entirety (the MM cauldrons being the hardest part). So if you have a solo mentality, might as well give up now. However, a group of low 30's (POSSIBLY high 20's if they were really good) could do everything this quest asks for. <BR>
<BR>
Now for clarification on some seriously erroneous posts. First off, you do NOT need amiable or better faction to get the molds....indifferent faction will suffice. I was indifferent to both Elisabeth and Thomas, and received the molds and information I needed. With near opposing races, you will have apprenhensive faction, and THAT you will need to correct (alot of human pallies have apprehensive faction with the dwarves). You DO need amiable or better faction for the Temple of Solusek Ro (where you gain the Sol Cauldron to mix the Ronium). The best way to gain faction the fastest is NOT killing shadowmen, but taking derv rings (4 at a time) to the named orc in South Ro, and/or 30 GP to the named wizard in South Ro (they are in the same place, by a hut, in the north west part of the zone). This took me about 2 hours to accomplish the faction I needed (you can con the named orc to see if you have amiable faction with the temple). You have to mix both the Ronium AND forge the armor itself. The Ronium is not smith required I don't believe and is not NO DROP so someone can make this for you. However, the molds are NO DROP and while forging the armor was trivial at 102 smithing skill, I would not dare to try this at less skill for fear of failing to make it. To forge the armor, take the mold and Ronium to any forge, and combine them (NO WATER, just the mold and ronium will suffice). Finally, the Armor of Ro is not NO DROP, so you can wear it, sell it, drop it on the ground, whatever you like.<BR>
<BR>
The stats for the BP are as follows:<BR>
<BR>
20 AC +4 STR +10 Fire saves 5.0 weight with a steel look.<BR>
<BR>
The stats for the Greaves of Ro are:<BR>
<BR>
14 AC +6 Stamina +10 Cold 3.7 weight and steel look. <BR>
<BR>
This is how I accomplished the quest for these parts:<BR>
<BR>
For the greaves I needed a Nightfall Giants head. These are not that rare, and are not NO DROP so you can purchase them (50-200 PP I've seen for them). One of my guild's wizards gave it to me after practicing his Ice Comet spell in WC for awhile hehe. <BR>
<BR>
The materials for the Ronium:<BR>
<BR>
The melatite you can purchase (up to 1000PP I've seen it sold for). My group has been camping Solusek's Eye, an we gained it off a CWG model MA gnomebot (rare drop). It is my understanding that any of the gnomes/bots can drop it, just most common off the MC and MA models.<BR>
<BR>
The Soil of Underfoot is gained from the priestess Ghalea at Kaladim Clerics Guild, and you will need amiable or better faction and 4 faerie (not pixie) dust. The soil is NO DROP and LORE so you will return here after each piece of Ro you make (joy).<BR>
<BR>
Sands of Ro are an uncommon drop off of the Sand Giants of Southern Ro and Oasis. It is neither NO DROP nor LORE and you can usually get it for free from any SG killing group or purchase it (I purchased one for 50 PP).<BR>
<BR>
2 Bars of Enchanted Platinum you can buy from any alloy selling store and have enchanted by a high level enchanter. I don't know the price as it was given to me as a gift. 200PP per bar I believe though.<BR>
<BR>
MistMoore Granite is garnered off any of the gargoyles in MistMoore (most commonly dropped by the Flouting and Leering). This is drop is not THAT rare, as my party gained 9 pieces in a 4 hour camp. You will need a high level puller (druid pref) for this, or a tight low 30's party to camp inside the castle.<BR>
<BR>
Breastplate of RO item:<BR>
<BR>
Two Dark Cauldrons off the Ancille Cooks in MistMoore are needed for this. They sit right smack dab in the middle of the castle, so good luck (again low 30's party, camping and pulling from the correct room in MM should be able to accomplish this). I had a 50th ranger from my Guild (Jeygo you're the best!) and a 33 Paladin camping with me for this, and it was HAIRY! (WTB clean shorts). In a 4 hour span, we gained 5 cauldrons (uncommon drop). <BR>
<BR>
Boots of Ro:<BR>

Needed are the Kilij plans off the unamed Sand Giant in Southern Ro. The only way to tell the difference is by conning it (conned black to me at 28th level). My group camped for it for 4 hours with no luck one night. Next night, while upping faction for Temple of Solusek, I ran right into it as it was beating up on a 31st level ranger. Between both of us we killed it (low 20's party could take this one no sweat). It doesn't have the HP or Damage that a full SG has  The Kilij plans are LORE but not NO DROP.<BR>
<BR>
Well that's one I've accomplished so far. Good luck to the rest of yas, and gimme a holler ifn ya needs help <BR>

			Also to clarify some argued things about the armor<BR>
Gauntlets of Ro - need locket from werewolf-Sentry Alechin in South Karana turns into a werewolf at night and drops this no drop item ( spawns in random places )<BR>
<BR>
Greaves of Ro- Easiest of all pieces- Nightfall Giants's head ( purchased from kind person for 20p (= ) in West Commons <BR>
<BR>
Vambraces of Ro- Plague Sharks- Erud's Crossing behind sunken ship ( beware the low level zombies like to attack us Paladins ) 2 rotten shark pieces<BR>
<BR>
Breastplate of Ro- Mistmoore Castle- off of the Cooks in center of castle- 2 Dark Cauldrons <BR>
<BR>
This all the for sure info i have aquired over the past week ( hehe ) <BR>
 Faction Tip: to gain better faction with freeport just give Altunic a medium tunic ( for token ) and give ( the paladin nearest the water ) ( i forget his name  starts with Q )a spider venom sac ( for other token ) and give him both tokens ( at same time ) to reveal a Militia Man in the sewer nearest you ( shoot arrow at him or he will run away )  Killing this Militia Man gives EXCELLENT faction with freeport Paladins and Clerics

			Ok...I have almost gathered all of the needed materials to do the helm and vambracers quest...However, I am still caught on the fact if I truly need to learn to Smith.  I was told anyone could smith the Ronium, and give it to me.  And that the dwarven smith will help me smith the actual armor with the ronium and mold.  Is that true?  Or should I start on my smithing again once more.<BR>
Thanks for all of your help!<BR>
