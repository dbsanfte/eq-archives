<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Daknar:
[B]I agree entirely about this problem. I'm tired of hearing about all these great events going on in other servers. I've invested a ton of time developing a character on The Rathe and have no inclination to start from scratch on another server. It is not fair that we on the Rathe don't get the same level of service that the other servers get. By not having events on the Rathe, we are reducing the overall experience of playing in an online roleplaying environment. I believe that there should be at least one event for all level ranges a month. One every week would be ideal. GM run events should not be a dream but a reality for every person that shells out $11 in service fees a month. Hell. I'd even pay a little more if it would mean having regular events. The lack of events makes the environment too static and things get boring too easily. Verant, if you want to keep us playing, make it worth our while to continue playing. Otherwise, bye,bye.

Now that I've vented my frustration, I want to know if there is anything I can do to help. Perhaps an events commity could be set up by players such as ourselves to help verant and GM's create events. I am willing to take on a pro-active role if it means more events. If any of you players or if any of you Verant administrators would like to discuss this vein of thought, please email me at alexisbryers@hotmail.com. This game is a great roleplaying environment. Lets do what we can to take full advantage of it!!!!

The quest was challenging and entertaining, and by the end of it, my partner and I had won a Fine Steel Longsword and a Blood Stained Mantle.  This was a newbie quest, and these were definitely nice to have for a newbie type-items. I heard one shout from some whiney baby who got some silver dwarven hammer or something or other I had never heard of, and they were crying about how it just was'nt all they had hoped and dreamed about, but hey KID: Welcome to planet earth!  Anyway, I just wanted to thank all of the people involved and who took part in the event for making it the really nice experience it turned out to be for my partner and I.  The event was posted well in advance (late October in fact) on stratics or somewhere, so to the rest of you who put posts here after that complaining about no events, it may do you well to read the news before posting your gripes.  There were announcements at this last event of another event coming up in Greater Faydark next Friday night (11/19), so there's your chance if you missed out on the last one!</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Mithandriel</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Just some shameless advertising:<P>The Brotherhood Frost will be hosting "Adopt a Zone" this Sunday evening (around 7PM(EST) in North Ro.
