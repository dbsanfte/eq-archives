<!--<tr><td><font face="verdana">I read a post before with a guy that claimed that he was a expert power lvler since he got a lvl 12 cleric in 2 days playtime. When I saw that I just had to replay I got my warrior to lvl 20 in 2 days 20 hours and 40 min playtime. This is how you do since I was an ogre I will tell you what I did but it will work with any warrior class or tank but remember that warriors lvl faster ten the other tanks.
The first 5 prectice points I used on this 2 skill on 1hs 1 on sense heading 1 on kick 1 taunt and 1 on 2hs. The 2hs weapons are better then the 1hs so you will do more dmg if you go with them and those who say that 1hs are better vs magic users are wrong. Its almost impossible to interupt and npc spell casting and they almost alwasy have some sort of buff the will burn you everytime you hit them and doind some dmg with the 2hs you wont hit them so often but you will hit hard. Then I started my killing. First I killed the few lizzard man and froglog tads that you find in the ferrot which is the Ogre newbie zone. I really was going to the Innothule swamp which is the troll newbie zone since that is much more populated but I was luckey and got to lvl 2 before I got there. I went back and got my 2hs skill up 5 more then I went to grobb and got a bind since you die to often at hte newbie lvls. The ogres are the most powerful race to choose they have by far the best stats for their class unless you choose the shaman. At lvl 2 I hunted kobolds and dont waste your time with lvl 1 creatures since they hardly give you any exp at all at lvl 2. When you have killed enough to be lvl 3 I bought myself a 2hs weapon form the merchant then I went to oggok and got my 2hs skill up some more. This is very good at low lvl since they skills dont raise fast then and you will kill the monster you fight faster and thous loose less hp so you can fight more. after I got back form my oggok visite I ran to Fp and got a bind there. then I started to kill those spiderlings and fire beetles in the N Ro zone. you will never have to look for something to kill and when you hit lvl 4 you should have so much money that you can start to buy some bandages. This is a very usefull skill that many people think is to expensive to use but if you buy from mages you can get it cheap and when you are low lvl they usually sell it cheap if they are nice. when you get the skill up to lvl 20 or so you heal 6 or 7 hp per bandages which will shorten your heal time alot. After that you kill jackals and orc raiders at lvl 4 or 5 dunno which lvl it was you hunt thewm untill you can kill rattlesnakes. When giant spiders con white you can take them if you have almost maxed skills with the ogre warrior since they are so powerful. If you find a scarab kill it even if it cons yellow. They are just as hard as Giant spiders without the poison and they are much better exp but make sure someone is close if you need help. BTW if you are an evil race you can sell to the Shady swashbuckler in the N Ro to East commons tunnel. At lvl 9 or 10 you should go to West commons and kill young Kodiaks (YK). They should con white by then. Stay close to the derv cmap since it is almost alwasy camped and you will then get help easy if you need it. Stay and kill there until lvl 13 or 14 then you should kill caimans and crocs in Oasis but at lvl 15 you should go and camp a derv camp. If its full when you get there get help to clear it out but you should really solo camp it since that is much better exp. Just make sure you got about 200 bandages and a few hours and you will be lvl 17 in no time. Try to camp it at an late or erlie hour so you dont have much competition. At lvl 17 go to East Karanas. The High hold pass people will NOT KOS you. Get the Bind in HHP and hunt dark stalkers, gorge hounds, Undead reavers (if you have a magical weapon) and gnoll reavers. the gogrge hounds and dark stalkers are best hunted from the village close to the beholders maze zone. Just pull them back so the many evil eyes wont attack you (You will be KOS by the guard if you enter the small village) Its best if you can have sow but its no must. Stay there until lvl 23 then go to Najena. There you should be able to solo kill the tentacle terrors that drop the Tentacle wjip and in a group (This should be the first time you group) you can kill ogre officers and the Bonecracker who drop the barbed leather whip. I just got to lvl 24 so I cant help you much more now. Happy hunting and I hope I see you on the Erolisi Mar server My name is Klauk.  </font></td></tr>-->
