-Siela, Gnomish Wizard

Why would anyone in their right mind want to take up baking you ask?  Some of you may have heard this question before, but here is Siela's explanation...

It is fun, yea I dont care what you say people, it is fun.  It feels nice knowing you can bake.  It MIGHT be worth money some day when the expansion comes out.  You might have a sick sence of humor and like eating Hot'n'Spicy Toelings.  You just want to see the really sick picture of Blackened'Teir'Dal!

Well now you know some of the reasons why...  but how?

First step to baking:  If they are not or have never been a master baker, stuff their big fat blabbering mouth with their own pathetic attempts at making edible goo to shut them up because they have no idea what they are talking about.

Siela subtly points a finger at all the trade skill web sights.

Second Step to baking:  What is baking?
Baking is a lost art in EQ.  Here is what I think...

One day happy Mr. Verant walks into his cubicle and says "Man, I am making minimun wage, maybe I should ask Bradd over there if he has any ideas for ripping thousands upon thousands of people off and getting them addicted to things that will hurt their real life relationships".
Brad auctions 'Everquest, 50 dollars for game and 50 dollars to play!'
Verant tells Brad 'Oh I will buy it!  Let me go to the bank first'

Later that year Brad and Verant have beta going and they need to add a few more trade skills so they say 'Hey, lets make pottery have tons and tons of profit for awhile to get people pissed at us for it being too profitable then lets ruin it so badly that there is no chance in hell you could get a copper off of it.  Oh, and someone throw together baking within the next 20 minutes'
So the poor beaten Verant employees whom we now call GMs had a little chip labelled 'Made in Akanon' implanted into their heads so that Verant could controll their minds.
**********************************
In the begining Verant created Brad Mcquaid and Everquest.  Everquest was without form, and baking.  And the advertisements were distracting UO players from UO.
Then Verant said 'Let there be trade skills':, and there were trade skills.
And Verant saw the trade skills, that they were bad, and Verant decided to keep them anyways.
Verant called the items lore, and the best items no drop.
Verant called upon one of its mind slaves and commanded 'Create baking'
10 minutes past, and another 5, and there was baking.
**********************************
Because baking was thrown together in 15-20 minutes, some of the books are WRONG, actually MOST of the books are WRONG, and most of the players are WRONG, and most of the web sites are WRONG =)

"So where am I to start?" a player once said.

With about 2pp, and 8 backpacks in your bank.  Baking may be the cheapest combining trade skill there is.

Most of the following is in list form for your convenience.

Read this, and you shall bake my friend...
-Baking is cheap and it is good to start early.
-Pottery and blacksmithing friends are great to have for a baker.
-Buy yourself a spit, it IS the SAME as an oven, use this spit as a container in your inventory when not using it.  It holds 6 spaces which in fact is quite nice.  I have 5 backpacks and a spit in my inventory, and my bank has a lexicon, a concordance of research, a mixing bowl for dough, and 5 backpacks in it.
-There is only one type of shop for baking that is very good, and it will have spices, jug of sauces, cup of flour, milk, etc, and many many recipe books.
-Write down all the recipes for baking on paper and put 2 columns next to it, I recommend doing this in old fashioned PENCIL as you might need to erase Verants mistakes sometimes.  use the columns for the following:   First colemn is Spit or Mixing bowl, X for spit - for mixing bowl.  Second colemn is TRIVIAL, check this box in if the item is trivial for you to bake, this way you will always know what to bake at your baking level.
-You dont need to keep the baking books for god sakes so throw em away now.
-Save up meat in your bank, and eggs, and other baking supplies then one day bake it all at once, thats what I do.
-Beer braised bear does not require tall beer, just use short.
-IMPORTANT:  Almost all of the pie recipes DO NOT REQUIRE SPICES, with the exceptions of 1 or two.
-I have not tested it but it seems to me that some foods do last longer than other foods, but the important thing to remember is weight, fish fillets, muffins, etc weigh almost nothing so you can advertise that to people if you want to try to sell baked goods to PCs.
-Sandwiches are made in an OVEN
-I will give you the dough recipe because it is very important for master bakers:
One Snake Egg, One Cup of Flour, One Bottle of Milk
Dough is trivial at early lvls and CAN BE EATEN, so be carefull not to eat your snake eggs or dough.  For snake eggs I recommend stomping around the front of FP and slaughtering regular snakes and stone snakes, any snake lvl 1-2 basically.  Large snakes and higher lvl snakes seem to have less eggs on em.
I would list all the recipes but they are already listed in detail in many places, just remember about the pies and sandwiches and beer braised bear.

I will pay 5pp for 5 brownie meat if you ever get so even if you dont need 5pp PLEASES TELL ME.

You can find baking ingredients...
Butcherblock, right outside of Kaladim in a little hut.  Steamfont, if you follow wall to the right when coming out of Akanon, also in a little hut.  In the first commonlands from Freeport next to the first inn a man in a small hut sells them.  In Halas they can be found in the attic of one of the houses.  In Toxuilla Forrest in one of the corners of the zone.  And right outside of Rivervale in a little hobbit hole when you follow wall to the right.
I am sure the dark elves, ogres and trolls also have access but I have never been a dark race because I am too wimpy to face the Felwithe guards. (THEY ARE BEASTS!!)

All that I ask in payment for this is to go into EQ and type /feedback
When it brings you to the feedback screen tell them that snakes should carry eggs way more often or snake eggs should be made more easily available.

Good luck bakers, when I wrote this I was lvl 142 in baking making me far over mastery.  Send me E-mail with questions or comments you might have.   Zoomoes@hotmail.com</font></td></tr>-->
