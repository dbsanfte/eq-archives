WTF? I don't make a habit of searching for serial killers to become drinking buddies with, so why would my character? Likewise I don't go down the street to the nearest Crack dealer and talk smack to him, knowing that he has no ability to kill me... so why should my character? And I don't run around downtown Chicago asking how to get to Blackburrow, so why would my character talk about Chicago? (This last question pertains to ALL EQ servers)<BR>   FIRST of all I'm not a lowbie slaying PK! Nor have I ever been. I don't profit off of looting the corpses of my player victims. I have even on two occasions been victim to player attacks. But I don't moan about it! I revel in it! WHAT A CHALLENGE! While most people spend there time hunting down NPC'c and creatures gaining experience for the purpose of going up against tougher NPC's and creatures, I'm doing the same thing but with a twist of the unpredictable... potential player opponents! <BR>   Now I am personally pro team pvp. I love it!! Unlike Rallos Zek there is structure. Your not looking behind your back every 5 seconds worrying about an attack from a fellow player. In team pvp you can can play it safe by sticking to your home area (except Freeport) or you can travel into other zones searching/causing trouble. As a Barbarian you will rarely see other teams and can therefore achieve L20+ without the fear of player attack.<BR>  The Team server also add realism because the players have an incentive to roleplay. Built in to these servers is how each society views the other races, which provides roleplay opportunities. Many players refused to help my dwarf character. And pretty much every team is against the the Evil teams. I have played UO, as well and never found a server that consistently roleplayed. But Tallon and Vallon Zek are predominantly roleplay servers.<BR>   EQ has 3 out of 25 servers pvp. Why? I think many people had heard stories of Ultima Online and feared getting PK'd. So when EQ shipped they had 1 out of 10 (i think) severs pvp. This drew the KILL KILL KILL crowd to that server. And it seemed that pvp meant Kill everything that moved! I played for 1 day and was immediately turned off by getting killed 5x in an hour. I never returned and played on a couple of nonpvp servers only to become bored and stopped all together. I started back up when the team pvp server came up and have been hooked since. IF YOU HAVE NOT YET TRIED THE TEAM SERVERS I HIGHLY RECCOMMEND THEM. You will find a true sense of community among your team mates. <BR>For those unwilling to try the Team servers I would be interested in hearing Why. My intent is to arouse interest in the Team servers so that others will be added. <BR>So why have you not tried Team Pvp? I would appreciate your responses. <BR>And If you have played I would appreciate your reactions too. <BR>            Sincerely,<BR>              Luddha<BR>President of TSAC<BR>the Team Server Awareness Committee<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#D9DCE8"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Silversight</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Good for you. :-)<P>------------------<BR>Silversight Quellious Server Master of the following: Baking, Blacksmithing, Brewery, & Fletching.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#E8EAF0"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">Bumbles</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana">In a sense, I agree with you.  You should have to "watch your back" as it were, but if I understand the team server concept, around home, ie; Riverdale for a halfling - you are safe from other halflings.  Let me know if I'm off base here.  I would point out that I am new to the game.  My first experience with online gaming was Diablo - I tended to develope a serious case of paranoia there.  I saw EQ and thought this would be very cool, avid AD&Der from long ago.  Unfortunately, the first character I created was on a PVP server (didn't notice the marking - my bad).  I am trying to fumble my way along as a 1/2 elf rogue, some one says, "Hey, let's group, we can kill more stuff and rate some good exp pts."  NP, I'm all for that.  We barely walk away from an elevator (Kelathan woods I believe) and some guy walks up and starts beating the heck outta three newbies.  I couldn't figure out what was going on.  I come back and head for my corpse, the same SOB is standing there finishing off someone else, walks up and starts kicking crap out of me again.  This happened a third time, as soon as I saw the guy I started running but no chance, DEAD!!!<BR>I realized I was on a PVP server and switched to a NON-PVP server.  There is sooo much to figure out, worrying about some one walking up and beating on you just isn't a hassle you need starting out.  PVP TEAM may be a good alternative.  I hate to start from scratch so soon (only managed to make it to 6th level rogue so far) but, I may give it a try.

If i have 20 lvl 1 friends we should be able to attack a lvl 10 guy and maybe win but most likly die. Why isn't the game like this ? If someone is lvl 50 then i want them to be able to walk into a newbie zone and make people kiss thier feet feet. Think about it don't people in the real world act this way? The realism is eliminated by these caps. Many a war was one by bands of under equiped  hordes beating down a smaller well equiped army. Its just the way it is. I play on a "blue serverr " most of the time becuase of  getting things stolen on other servers, and I'll be honest about that. I spent 2 weeks  of camping  to get my BiBs. I lost many a bubble and so did my frinds that where trying to help me. If after trying so hard for 2 weeks i had been pked and lost the item, I don't think i could play that character anymore. The only character i might play would be a monk who doesn't need anything but magic gloves which are fairly easy to aquire. So i do have a monk on the teams server, but I really don't play him much. Does this ansxwer  your question?<P>Beureguard</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></td></tr></table>
