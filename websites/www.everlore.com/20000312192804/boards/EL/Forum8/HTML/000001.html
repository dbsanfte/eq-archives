</FONT><HR>We have all seen the recent debates about Necros being able to resurrect.  I saw a post from someone that suggested that on the PvP servers (Rallos/Tallon Zek) that Necros be able to raise the dead of a PC into a ghoul or something.<P>I have a refinement on this idea that I think is very cool....Please read on...<P>I think that Necros should be given a new spell for use on the PvP servers.  This would probably be a research spell that you can get at 16 or 20.  This spell would be called Will Of Innoruuk.  Basically, it would be like making a sacrifice to Innoruuk.  Here's how it would work...<P>Say I need a pet, and there happens to be a halfling just a Shadow Step away.  Well, I would just:<BR>1.) Cast Will of Innoruuk on the target PC to flag that this is a sacrifice.<BR>2.) Try to kill the pitiful lightdweller just as one would in any other battle.<P>IF I SUCCEED AT THE SACRIFICE (win the fight), then I have a new pet ghoul.<BR>BUT,<BR>IF I FAIL AT THE SACRIFICE (lose the fight), then I die and lose a VERY LARGE amount of xp (maybe 1-2 bubs) for wasting Innoruuk's time, not using my skills wisely, and for bringing shame onto the Church of the Firstborn by dying to a lightdweller.<P>FAQ<BR>Q: So, what happens if I get sacrificed?<BR>A: You return to bind point as if you died from...uh...natural causes.<P>Q: Will my body still be there after I get sacrificed?<BR>A: Yes, the Necro steals your soul, not your whole body.<P>Q: Can the Necro loot my corpse too?<BR>A: No, he already got your soul.  Isn't that enough?<P>Q: Is there any chance for revenge if I get sacrificed?<BR>A: Oh, yes!  If you see hat Necro again and kill him, you get your xp back from the last time he sacrificed you (with a bonus added).  Plus, you can loot him.<P>Q: If I try to kill the Necro after he sacrifices me, can he use my own soul (in ghoul form) against me?<BR>A: Yes.  You might want some help if you plan to get revenge right away.<P>Q: Won't this spell lead to newbie hunting?<BR>A: Not really.  Necros would be limited to sacrificing PCs that con white and above.<P>Q: So, I risk alot by trying to sacrifice someone.  How good is this pet anyway?<BR>A: The new pet should probably be a ghoul, since it is technically a gift from Innoruuk in return for a sacrifice.  It would be the level of the PC that was sacrificed.<P>Q: During a Sacrifice Battle, what about 3rd party players?<BR>A: Innoruuk prevents ANY 3rd party players from getting involved.  (Nobody else can heal or attack the Necro or Potential Sacrifice)<P>Q: How much mana and damage will this spell, Will of Innoruuk, take?<BR>A: The mana to cast this should be pretty low.  Probably around 10 or so.  However, this spell will do NO damage.  It is a mere flag to the game that a Necro is attempting a sacrifice and a flag to the hunted that he is about to get lain on the altar.  (If sacrifices become unbalanced, this could be offset by giving the sacrificial lamb a slight buff - like Fight or Flight - that gives them either a chance to get away or stay and fight better.  After all, their SOUL is at stake here!)<P>*NOTE*:  These are just ideas that I came up with today.  I think they are pretty cool and would add lots of excitement to the PvP world.  These ideas are far from polished, but I did try to think of everything and keep it as balanced as possible.  Please send me your feedback and, if necessary... FLAME ON!<P>---------<BR>Kazmodeis<BR>13 DE Necro<BR>Prexus<BR>Soon to be another DE Necro on Tallon Zek...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=8&topic=000001.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=Necromancer|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=PLEASE+READ+AND+RESPOND!!!+(long+msg)">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#D9DCE8">

</FONT><HR>  OK  this subject about the "low energy" and then doing so forth with the sacrificing. i think that there should be a certain weapon for this that does less dmg  depending on how much health youre aponnent would have when you flag them saying hey im comin to kill you. also how would you know if they flaged you? i think that there should be some kinda cost to sacrifice them like you do when you are pulling youre pet. you have to have bone chips to pull a pet why not have something you have to have to sacrifice a PC? and i thik the mana cost should be a little more maybe 10 at the start but when you lvl and get more mana and be able to sacrifice a higher lvl that the mana cost should go up. i just  wanted to put a few words in as i have a lvl 15 necro on inorukk server.  <IMG SRC="http://www.everlore.com/boards/EL/smile.gif"> (^.^) </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=8&topic=000001.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=Necromancer|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=PLEASE+READ+AND+RESPOND!!!+(long+msg)">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#D9DCE8">

</FONT><HR>Although I am  a dark elf necromancer I know of many that are not of my race and I do believe that they don't warship Innoruuk so why would they sacrifice their enemy to a different god?  So necromancers warship the plauge bringer (LOSER GOD)  or some other god besides Innoruuk.  It sounds good but can use some work = )</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=8&topic=000001.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=Necromancer|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=PLEASE+READ+AND+RESPOND!!!+(long+msg)">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#E8EAF0">

</FONT><HR>Concept is cool but here are some problems with it.<P>1) If you prey is white or above name a class that wouldn't be able to kill you if you didn't already have a pet.  If you did your spell couldn't work because you don't have a pet.  Necros are not good at Hand to hand.  But on PvP you would kite them...and that isn't fare either.  PC's aren't like NPC's.  PC's have alot harder time running down a caster than NPC's.<P>2) About not letting anyone interfer.  Thats not a good.  Programming wise this would take a fair amount of effort.  One way around this could be make it a duel but on a PvP server they are useless except within the same race.  Plus even in Duels other people can heal you.  I don't think its fair to hit someone out of the blue (not con) and allow no one to help.  This would cause necros to sit and watch players that are higher then them fighting and when they are low on hitpoints just cast the first spell, then DoT them and run.  Said prey would have no hope as the necro could get off 2 spells before anyone knows what has happened...even 3 then run.  You are now invisible to all their friends, He or She has 200hp but you just hit them with HeatBlood and Engulfing Darkness.  Bamn they are dead in 30 seconds without you breaking a sweat.<P>The other thing is that if you have thier soul then what is their new body walking around with?  <P>Overall I see this as too unbalanced especially at level 16-20. <P>My 2 cents worth<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=8&topic=000001.cgi&ReplyNum=000008&forum=Necromancer|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=PLEASE+READ+AND+RESPOND!!!+(long+msg)">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#D9DCE8">

</FONT><HR>You have obviously put some good thought into this but it is too complex. I have a vision of a new person coming into the game and someone does some weird ritual thing to him and he dies for some reason and he does not know how to get his stuff back, or he is now lost and confused etc. Why not just play the game instead of always looking for some sort of edge over everyone else?<P>------------------<BR>Pharao<BR>Dark Elf Necromancer of the 12th Season<BR>Resident of the world of Tarrew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=8&topic=000001.cgi&ReplyNum=000009&forum=Necromancer|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=PLEASE+READ+AND+RESPOND!!!+(long+msg)">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana"><A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum8&number=8&thisthread=000001&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum8&number=8&thisthread=000001&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
