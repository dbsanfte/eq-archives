<!--<tr><td><font face="verdana">There are many options for classes and races in EQ, all having in one form or another some kind of attraction and benefit.  This guide applies to the WaRRIOR class, and is specifically aimed at general applications of skills and training in order to make your beloved warrior a force to be dealt with and respected in all of Norrath.

First, understand your limitations.  *You cannot cast spells, but more vital, you cannot heal at a rapid rate, and this will lead to a serious amount of down time should you enjoy solo carving.

*You have few "utility" skills when compared to you brethrin in the hybrid classes.  Accept this, and learn to live with it.  You will be a superior melee figure, just learn to deal with the fact that this superiority comes at the expense of much needed utility.

*You can become one dimensional should you not WORK at being diverse. Simple rule, but more on this later

Now lets have a glance at your talents and what you must work on to be skilled at higher rank.  Remember, nearly any warrior can be skilled at level 20, but if you fail to plan your road will be much less rewarding as you advance.

You are a weapons master.  rather, you CAN be a weapons master if you put in some work.  This means that you MUST train with many types of weapons.  Do not ignore the two handed slashing blades because you believe you will dual-wield at rank 13.  The fact is there are many weapons in the land, and you do not know what you will scrounge up as you walk along the path of glory.  So, make a plan, train in at least three types of weapons, and dont box yourself in.

Learn to use a bow.  No, dont become a fletching master at low rank.  That is far to expensive.  get ahold of a good hickory bow and train your fletching up to around a 30.  This will allow you to make minor arrows to keep your quiver filled, though it will not allow much more than this.  The bow is your method of pulling enemies to you.  use it.  After all, what good is a warrior if he has no ranged attack?

learn to bandage yourself.  And learn it well.  It is a difficult skill to begin learning, and I advocate putting at least 5 pracs toward it to start out.  Your down time will be long enoough, being able to bind your wounds will speed things alone a bit.

Be BRAVE.  What do I mean by this?  Simple, act like a warrior when faced with danger.  Fall in place of your fellows allowing them to escape.  Be the brunt of the battle, be the leader of your group. let no one think for a moment that you will falter.  Why?  As a warrior you will represent the holdout, the true hero, the lone figure who refuses to bank on spirits or potions.  let them know that as a warrior you will face down your foes, in doing this you set a tone that will allow others of our kind to prosper.  Further, and perhaps more vital to the young warrior, running is foolish.  If you run you usually just die tired.  let the mages flee, let the priests fall back, your place is at the front, blade in hand, ready for battle.

A final note to you young warriors.  Many of the hybrid fighter classes have skill sets that are close to ours.  I have heard Rangers laugh at our brave warriors, claiming that they have more skill that we. After all, the only warrior skill rangers lack is bash.  But this is the fact, Warrior skill levels have higher max totals, that, coupled with plenty of warrior only weapons and armor makes us the true lords of battle.

Good luck, see you on the front.

				For those who feel that a warrior starts to suck after level 20 have faith.. you are designed to be the lord of the mob, a dungeon master of battle.<BR>
Do not get jealous of low levels soloing crap you cant... cause guess what they are normaly the first to die in a dungeon. While us brave hitpoint AC mob bashers are the last to go.<BR>
So when you hit your mid 20s start heading towards the dungeons to fell appreciated and ignore the soloing... We arent designed to solo, we are designed to be in a dungeon with a mob around us hacking away.<BR>
<BR>
Now if verant will only give us a AoE taunt at high levels we can go out in a BLAZE OF GLORY!!!
