				an update to my above post.  I was given an offer I couldn't refuse for my helm.  So yesterday I camped the bear again with success.  The girl that was there previously had camped the bear for 13 hours without success.  I camped the bear for 9 1/2 hours until it finally spawned.  Which makes me believe it is indeed a 24 hour spawn.  Also I took a good look at the bear an it is huge.  Its bigger than Iceberg.  Almost twice as big.  Also only the pelt was on the bear and not the ingot.  So if your camping for the ingot, you may have to kill several Glacier Bears.

				I camped the Glacier Bear for just over 1 hour when he appeared. He spawns at the entrance to the house with the skeletons in it. He is as big as a mammoth and cons blue to me. I am level 34 Barabarian Shaman. I cast my toughest spell on him(winters roar) and he resisted it. Seeing that he resisted my spell I sat back and let my pet kill him while I healed my pet and hit the bear every once in a while to distract and inflict damage. I greater healed my pet with greater healing 3 times and he killed the bear. And the bear dropped the pelt only. One footnote is that my pet conned blue to me which puts him in the 25-27 range. So if you pull a green pet, kill him and summon a new one.<BR>
My recommendation to someone wanting this is to try and summon a tough pet and sit back and heal your pet. You will surely die if you waste all your mana on him and he kills your pet. He is very tough! Good luck and don't believe all the others who say this is a easy bear...he is not easy.

				To the previous poster who said this bear was not easy, you aren't doing it right if its not easy for you, especially if you have a pet.  I doubt I could have solely meleed it myself, but at 29 I took the bear out.  All you need to do is plaster it with DOTs, roughly 5 or 6 of them and just play around with it until it dies.  The reason your Winters Roar didn't work on it is because it is 100% resistant to our shamanic DD's, the cold ones at any rate.  As a side note, I saw one ingot drop in 30+ hours, which does make me glad I'm not doing the cleric armor quests.

				ok this is straight from the gm's mouth. the bear, like many other spawns is randomized.but its done all based on percentages, based on the last spawn and rate of spawn. so i just hit a string of bad luck when i tried. it had died three times in a row on friday. so on saturday and sunday the chances of him spawnin was super slim. the chances get better with time. its all just luck. it is an 8hr spawn. give or take 15min.<BR>

				Well there is a bit of information that is very important to this quest that needs to be cleared.  First of all there is a MAJOR bug in this quest so BE WARNED.<BR>
 If you do not have a PRIMARY inventory slot open and attempt to right click to loot the Glacier Bear pelt YOU WILL LOSE THE PELT.  I have petitioned the GMs over 3 times on this Bug with no luck.<BR>
 This is a known bug that has been there since this quest began.  Simple solution is to make the pelt regular sized, proper solution make the pelt fall back on the corpse saying you do not have room in your inventory.<BR>
<BR>
Ok, here are some facts from my communcations with several people (the poor clerics I feel for them, as the icon is not on every Glacier bear) and from what I have seen down there.<BR>
The spawn is in fact 8 hours with a 30 minute window either way.  Right before the Glacier bear is suppose to spawn you will find  a roaming Ice bone skelly, kill it immediately. There are suppose to be two of them, after you kill the one that is the trigger I have seen either another Ice Bone Skelly or the Glacier Bear come out.<BR>
The two times I have seen the bear he came out WITHIN 5 minutes of killing the Ice Bone Skelly roamer (although I have ben told it can be as late as 30 minutes afterwards)<BR>
People have told me of two roamers I have only seen one on a regular basis, I believe the second one they see is actually the Glacier Bear Place holder.<BR>
If you spend any time down there you will be familuar with the area I am about to describe. Go close to the area of Suloon Mcmoor, pull back to the intersection that leads towards the exit.<BR>
the two times I have seen the bear the IBS placeholder was in that area, one time he was just standing there a little ways from suloon (May have just spawned and not started walking) and the other time he met me at the intersection as I was walking in.<BR>
Both times the Bear appeared for me it was 5 minutes after I killed the roamer. (the other 3 almost exactly 5 miuntes afterwards the IBS place holder came)<BR>
The bear did not appear to spawn at the exact location the two times I saw him. Although he may have given me the slip the second time. (he is a HUGE bear, but you know how packet loss and other factors in this game effects things:) Although from what everyone has told me the bear comes from Suloon's area and the first tmie I saw him, indeed he did.<BR>
The second time I saw him I was heading FROM suloons to the intersection and I saw a quick peak at him and again to packet loss he disappeared. I went around the corner and he was just standing there in front of the stationary IBS area.  I really think he came from suloon's area and he &quot;skipped&quot; me somehow.<BR>
 My advice is after you kill the roamer be on the look out and at the very least turn around and look around a bit.<BR>
My other bits of advise is to wait at least 30 minutes after you kill a roamer to log and now you at least have an idea on the approx time of the spawn. There are a few more tricks to getting this bear.<BR>
1. If you have the luxury of having two accounts and two computers you log a ranger or other tracker down there and wait <BR>
(actually any other character capable of handling IBs is good enough, the tracking is a definate bonus though)<BR>
2. My favorite is get set up at the spawn area BEFORE the system is to be taken down for a known outage. Use evermon to know when to log in and get on ASAP. A lot of people do this so you had better get on ASAP.<BR>
Most of the time after a system reset the hard to get items will be reset, this is one of them. There have been two times I was close to the area after a system reset I ran down there casually to check it out and found another person coming out after bagging the bear. This is not a 100% system but it seems to be the least painful option.<BR>
3. Another option is to get in with a person that needs the other item (pelt or Icon)and agree to camp for x hours each. Bind yourself there and play around a bit ie Icey Orcs and agree to swap out in a bit. You can get in or out without enduring breath, MAKE SURE you know where the small hole is near Megan's tower as the larger more used hole is too far away.<BR>
<BR>
A couple other notes on the bear, he resists Shaman Cold DD 100% so don't waste your mana on them, instead use dots, root and/or run around at lower levels at 34 and above use Dots and your pet. If you try this at a lower level (below 28 or so) the bear will give you some trouble. Even if you die you can still kill the bear. Make sure you are not fighting right over your bind spot. (BTW, you should never ever ever fight over your bind spot,imho)if you die mem your Dots and Root real quick and get back at it.<BR>
<BR>
The pelt and Icon are Lore/no drop also there is usually some meat and a ruined bear pelt too. BE SURE YOU click on the items first and loot the Glacier bear pelt first into an open primary inventory slot. The other items are there to screw you out of the Glacier bear pelt and serve no other benefit or purpose, you can remember to have an open slot, loot the ruined pelt and meat first, fill up your slots with junk and lose the pelt even though you remembered to have an open slot. THANKS VERANT.<BR>
BTW, even though the items are no drop DOES NOT MEAN you can not finish the quest even though a buddy of your has it and you have the rest or the needed items. Go TOGETHER at the same time to the proper NPC in Lake Rath, both of you turn in the items to the NPC and you still get your quest item. All the totemic works that way(along with most other quests of this nature), set on triggers and a time limit.<BR>
<BR>
This is by far one of the most ignorant quests and is an insult to those that have to or want to do it.<BR>
By the time you are high enough to kill the Glacier Bear you get no other exp down there. If you get exp down there the Glacier bear will kick your rear if he comes out.<BR>
To add more insult is to have another IBS as a place holder. this has lead to much confusion on if the place holder has spawned or did I kill the &quot;other&quot; roamer. A place holder for this quest is ignorant enough, making it the same as the trigger is just plain lazy and stupid on verant's part.<BR>
<BR>
For those of you considering trying to kill Suloon for fun I suggest not trying. He is about level 47 not 50 as someone else already noted . A 49 shaman, 35 cleric 38 bard and me at 39 (shaman also) tried and only got him 1/2 way down, and all of the damage was via our pets. 100% resists on all our our spells. In the cave environment it was extremely difficult to coordinate anything and heal anyone. I had to gate with 90% mana and 2 of us died trying to kill him. Definately not worth the trouble.<BR>
<BR>
Although my lengthly article may have errors in it I have spent much time getting this information and a large part of this information has been gotten via first hand experience.<BR>

Brothers and Sisters of the North.  It has come to my attention that<BR>
recently in one of the patches Verrant has changed the PH of the Ice Bear from that of a IBS to<BR>
a lvl 45 Necro.  And no this is not the same Erodite hermit either. Please petition the GMs about this and spread the word.<BR>
If I am wrong about this please correct me.<BR>

				Just some input it seams since they added the Glacier Bear for the Class specific quests any new patch has added a new bug to it.As a lvl 31 barbarian warrior i went down into the caves the 3rd day after the patch with a Shaman friend to get the pelt for him it was early in the morn so it wasnt camped lucky for us we got lucky again walking along the wall left of the entrance where you come in from the river was the bear just walking along he conned blue to me i soloed him with just 2 minor heals from my shaman friend hes tough as far as size goes hes no bigger than Iceberg,he looks bigger cause your inside a cave thats all.Oh also he dropped both the pelt and the ingot.

				I encountered the Glacier bear after my second visit to the caves.  I took the advice of earlier posts and used the spell &quot;Sense Animal&quot;.  It saved me loads of time looking around and let me stop in for a quick visits.  Use it!<BR>
<BR>
The bear conned blue to me as a Lvl 30 Shaman.  It resisted all cold DD spells so I stacked a couple of DoTs and rooted it.  While rooted, I switched to my 2 handed blunt Ogre War Maul since I didnt need the extra wisdom items for the remaining battle.  Big Mistake!  I found out the hard way the the Glacier Bear is invunerable to non-magic weapons.  This required a quick switch back to the trusty Enamelled Black Mace to finish it off. Note: requires magic weapons.<BR>
