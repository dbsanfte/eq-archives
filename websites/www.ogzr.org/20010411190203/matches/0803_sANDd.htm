        Our first outing in STA Alpha and we are victorious. We played against <a target="_blank" href="http://sd2k.clanpages.com/">[S&amp;D]</a>
        on cs_militia. Just prior to the match the other team claimed they could
        only field 4 players, then miraculously they had 7 joining the server.
        Pings were equal and the game was started.<br>
        <br>
        Round one began poorly for the Geezers as [S&amp;D] brought the pain.
        The Geezers were CTs and S&amp;D were Ts. [S&amp;D] employed a simple 3
        front, 3 back strat that had us gasping for air within 5 rounds. But
        then the Geezers changed the batteries in their hearing aids, unlocked
        the wheel-break on their wheelchairs, and started to take longer to die.
        As the first 30 minutes were counting down the geezers were coming back
        though and we finished the first rotation at Geezers 6, S&amp;D 10.<br>
        <br>
        Round two is where the Geezers excelled. As Terrorists the Geezers were
        nearly undefeated, keeping [S&amp;D] held back each and every round. The
        [S&amp;D] team was becoming angry and displayed it freely, but the
        Geezers stayed vigilant and brought home victory after victory. The
        second rotation ended at Geezers 9-[S&amp;D] 1, for a match total of
        Geezers. 15-[S&amp;D] 11.<br>
        <br>
        A big congrats to the team, and a thank you to VRMan for stepping in
        when Nasty's ISP gave him trouble. Also, I want to thank [S&amp;D] for
        coming to the match.</td>
