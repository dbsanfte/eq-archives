        Round 1: 19-43<br>
        Round 2: 8-41<br>
        <br>
        We played both rounds on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.assassinsclan.com">aC</a>'s
        server since we are still working out some issues with our servers.
        Pings were fairly even, except for a couple of our guys (but they have
        problems everywhere). OGzr had to fill in a couple roster spots at the
        last minute due to some real life(tm) issues. Big thanks to Mr.McFeely
        and Frank the Avenger for coming out of &quot;retirement&quot; to join
        us. Try as we might to get our STA record to .500, it was not to be
        thanks to aC's great teamwork.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Round 1</b><br>
        Both teams sprint out at start and both got fairly quick touches. aC had
        good success in bringing home several full caps. OGzr got a couple
        movement points but were stymied until late in the round when Mr.McFeely
        pulled out 2 full caps. Round 1 score 19-43.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Round 2</b><br>
        More of the same. They shut their defense down even harder this round
        and they sure kept on capping flags too. OGzr got a few movement points
        but no real caps. Things deteriorated a bit at the end to a crowbar
        scout taking on our HWguy, but hopefully he was taught a lesson. :^)
        Round 2 score 8-41<br>
        <br>
        aC handled us pretty well but they remained great sports and fun
        competitors. This was a clean match, and they just flat-out beat us.
        Final tally: 27-84. GG and good luck in the future!
