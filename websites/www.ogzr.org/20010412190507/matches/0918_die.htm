        The Geezers girded their loins on Monday for some Openfire action
        against clan <a href="http://dieclan.clanpages.com/" target="_blank">[DIE]</a>.
        The Old Ones felt quite confident about this old favorite map…perhaps
        too confident!<br>
        <br>
        <b>Round 1</b>: Geezers pull a quick cap with some conc’ing
        magic…then, another with some coordinated spy work. Defense holds
        tight with excellent communications, able to shutdown [DIE]’s Offense
        when the flag started moving. In the heat of furious spies and lights,
        the score ties…Only to fall in OGzr’s favor with a third and final
        cap. Final score—30-20!!<br>
        <br>
        <b>Round 2</b>: Geezer confidence set in while we patted each other on
        the back in mIRC…meanwhile, [DIE] was hot and heavy on their server
        improving their strat. The round starts much tighter than the first,
        with the Defense earning their sweat and blood. SG’s go up, SG’s go
        down. [DIE] pulls two caps, then [OGzr] brings it within one. The bad
        guy stepped up his spy employment, and pulled a third, to end the
        round…30-10. Final score, 50-40.<br>
        <br>
        While the competition was stiff, [DIE] remained true professionals, a
        fun clan to do battle with. GG [DIE] and GL!
