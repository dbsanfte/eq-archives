We also decided to check out the reavers since it was the only piece she was missing. We got a Jade reaver on the second kill of the first cycle. How awesome is that. Anyway, everyone give a big Grats to our first epic Druid. We also looted the second stone, not sure if it can be MQed but if it can we will be getting Emong's in the next couple days.</p>

They had engaged a Senior Guard and the battle was going well when Sabanizi yelled that she was under attack. Chracner spun to face this new enemy. Rage filled his heart as he saw the much dreaded enemy of the Ancients Captain Bvellos beating on Sab. Without regard for personal safety he rushed in and landed a flying kick to get Bvellos's attention. Chracner's staff and feet worked as one as they landed blow after blow on this hated foe. Alas he was out matched, not only in size but in fighting ability. All that kept him standing were the magics of his friends and pure hatred of Bvellos.<br><br>It was then that Chracner heard a loud crash behind him and knew that help was coming. With the guard dead the rest of the Ancients fell upon Bvellos like a pack of ravenous wolves. For the first time in thier rivaled past Bvellos knew fear. He turned to flee but the ice beneath his feet cracked as vines and roots broke through to entangle him. As he fell he uttered a prayer that fell on the uncaring ears of Rallos Zek. He had been forsaken......</p>

Our aventures are always filled with heros to cheer for but often lack the monster that most adventures are defined by. This adventure is a little different. Its whole theme is based on trust. The kind of trust one can only put in their closest friends.<br><br>Our heros, Saxmoore, Halicia, Jovvi, Sindaria, Chracner, and Miss, yes Miss. It seems like only yesterday we saw little Miss killing no name monsters on the planes of the Overthere and now to see her deep in the heart of Old Sebelis seemed kind of odd. Barely out of the food her mother had packed for her when she left the great city of Halas, to be traveling with the likes of these other five battle hardened heros was an adventure in itself.<br><br>Alas, were our adventure to end with the journey itself it would have grand enough, but it did not. <br><br>Down the twisting halls they battled, monster after monster, they faught, to the very entrance of what the old timers fondly call "the Disco". At the entrance they were stalled, Chracner lay flat on his back daring not move for fear he would bring the wrath of the froglok nation down upon them. The battle raged around him as he lay there helpless to offer anything save advise. The only things standing in the way of total destruction and an end to the adventure were a young barbarian rogue named Miss and trust. Her trust that the others would not let her fall and their trust that she would not quit, not run, not fail in the task they had appointed her.....<br><br>Oh what battles they faught. Everyone had a place and knew what it was. Everyone faught like true heros.<br><br> These rare moments when you only have your faith to guide you, it is nice to have someone to put that faith in......Dremarian</p>

    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Standing in the Nexus, our band of adventurers commited to a course. This night, the Plane of Disease would be explored even at the cost of our lives if need be. The brave souls at the beginning of the journey included Marloon, talented mage and master of the elements; Baron Saxmoore, the powerful wizard and leader of our small army; Baronness (?) Cristineiya, the druid, one with nature and bearer of formidable earthen magics; Halicia, faithful vicar and restorer of life; Sindaria, the beguiling Enchantress, able to fascinate and charm the worst of beasts long enough for us to vanquish their brethren; and myself, a humble Cavalier of Marr, ready to bear the brunt of whatever onslaught we might face in that blighted place.<br><br>After speaking to the keeper of the gateway to the outskirts of Bertoxx' plane to get clearance to enter, we all leapt into the gate itself, a huge foul-looking spigot, ever flowing with unnatural murky waters. We arrived in the graveyard of this dark humid place, surrounded by the corpses of other adventurers, a warning perhaps? This was a hideous place, sticky fetid humid, with an evil odor drifting from the rivers of waste that flow thru it. We made our way thru the huge hairs growing out of the ground, past several other brave souls, til we found a clearing near a nest of venomous spiders. I set off to bring one to us and its offspring, which I hadn't seen, came as well. To our shock these evil beasts tend to wield magics almost as powerful as our own, so our Enchantress had to weave her spell of fascination on one, keeping it enthralled as we destroyed the other. Marloon's elemental servant fought valiantly as I kept the attention of the huge arachnid. Halicia saved my life many times over, completely healing me as this vicious....thing, tore into my armored form. Cristineiya while summoning thorny vines to shield me and damage the beast, also managed to patch a wound that might have killed me seconds before Halicia's healing could take effect, thus once again saving the life of this humble knight. Finally, with a devastating blast from our wizard we vanquished the more powerful of the 2 and went to work destroying its foul offspring. This went on in similar fashion for a time, until a crafty pair of spiders finally got the better of me, as one held my attention as it's cunning sibling relentlessly attacked our beloved healer. It refused to be deterred even by Sindaria's considerable enchantments. I swore beneath my breath as I turned, much too late, to see faithful Halicia fall to its fangs. Vowing vengeance, I shouted to Baron Saxmoore to call upon his magics to whisk the others clear as I too fell to their attack, mercilessly struck down from behind by the original monster....<br><br>Later after Halicia called on her(his) powers to revive us, we ventured out again, unfortunately without the assistance of the mage Marloon, but we attracted the attention of an outrider of considerable experience who was exploring the area on his own, traveling under the name of Breowan. He assisted us in ridding the area of scores of its revolting inhabitants, including different varieties of tsetsian flies, larvae, and vile pox-ridden disease infested rats. He fell valiantly at one point in the battle as well but Halicia speedily returned him to the fight. All in all, I think we made our mark on this foul place, though it did seem to mock us as we left and more vile fiends appeared to replace those we laid waste to...<br><br>(as you can see, it's a slow day at work. long story short we went to PoD camped spiders, whacked em, me and Hali died once, then mar left and breowan was tryin to solo where we were pulling from. we took all spawns so he joined our group. He died once, then we killed stuff til we got sleepy and left......Jaimekash</p>

Island one went great and we got our keys with no problems at all. We then moved to island two and the home of Gwan, our target. <br><br>Everyone was in the wind mill which is the center piece for this tiny island, they were all buffed as planned, this is the last thing that went right for the team. <br><br>The plan was for Gymli to aggro Gwan and pull him into the wind mill where everyone else would kill him. Chrac did the hand in, said the magic words, and the fun began. Gymli got Gwan to the ramp then got blown backwards off the island and out of the zone. Dan took over as MA and we proceeded to hack him good. Then Dan gets summoned outside on a bad pathing deal and blown off the island. Now here is where things get realy crazy. Chracner and Graphyte start ping ponging Gwan back and forth until finally Chracner gets blown out of the mill and off the island. Now if you are keepin score, Chracner is the reason they went to this place, and now they have lost not 1 but 3 tanks from the main group. Now at this point most weaker souls would have packed their bags and took the leap off the side off the island, but not our team. Graphyte, who for the record is ten levels lower then Gwan, gave him a timely 650 point Harm touch to get its his attention, and group two, with the tattered remains of one took it to the hoop. <br><br>Now some would say that we are weak for having had it get that out of control. I say we did it our way and won. That was quite possibly 5 minutes of the most intense fighting I have seen in game to date, and I had to watch most of it on anothers screen because I was out of the fight. Some were lost through no fault of their own, they gave their lives for the cause. I solute you all, I am proud to stand among your ranks and be called an Ancient.</p>

It is however filled with terrifying monsters that live for the sole purpose of gnawing on the bones of those foolish enough to venture here.<br><br>So why would anyone be foolish enough to go here? Well that is exactly what I set out to find tonight, the reason. I joined a group of Ancients, grim faced and hardened by battle, these were a motley bunch of misfits. I will have to tell you I had great concerns as we faught our way to the very foot of the great Ssraeshza temple in the center of the zone. Once there my mind was put at ease as this band twisted and turned and conformed into one leathal killing machine. Arm to arm with their back to the temple they layed waste to all that dared near them. <br><br>I dont know that I learned the reason that folks go to the Grey, it is a frightening place no matter the company. I did not take home the riches and loot the great items of mythe that are said to be had in this zone. I did however learn something, something very valuable. Standing at the base of that temple, side by side with these great people, I learned what it meant to be an Ancient of the Realm. They are much more then what they appear, alone they may be nothing, but when they are together they are a force to be reckoned with. They are much more then the strength of their steel and the power of their magic. Their strength goes much deeper than that. They are friends.............</p>
