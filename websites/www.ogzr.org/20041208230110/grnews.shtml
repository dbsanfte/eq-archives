    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">BATTLE REPORT<br>By Lt.Sam <br><br>The Night....!<br><br>Friday night started out as another night. We were to play AOW but CGI also showed up and we all decided to do a 3-way. CGI has been around for a long time. Just like AOW their a great bunch of guys who love to play Ghost Recon the way it was meant to be played.<br><br>The Battles...!<br><br>The match started out with CGI winning the first map. AOW took the second. The Geezers first win cam on the 5th map. We trailed the other teams 2-2-1. CGI and AOW won the next 3 maps before the Old Geezers won their second. We trailed the other teams by the score of 4-3-2 with CGI in the lead. The battles were brutal and furious. Each team moving in formation to engage the enemy and at times one team getting slammed quickly by the other two.<br><br>THE Defense...!<br><br>It was now midnight. The War still raging. A few maps ended in draws with the Geezers battling hard to stop the on-slaught from the other two teams. CGI was a dominating team. Their aggressive style of play made it difficult to formulate plans and tactics. We continued to find ourselves defending from the SHOCK and AWE Spamming and pounding they delivered upon us but still we survived. We were not to be pounded, not in our server.<br><br>THE COME BACK...!<br><br>With the score CGI 4 AOW 3 Geezers 3, we decided it was time to take the battle to them. It's our turn to pound AOW and CGI. It was time to take back the maps we lost and it was time to show them. We WILL NOT SURRENDER!<br>We won a desperately need map keeping the Geezers alive and in the hunt. Now with 3 wins, we entered the next map feeling a little more confident that we could actually win. Unfortunately, AOW took the next map. It wasn't luck; it was good gaming that put them ahead. CGI and AOW now each had 4 wins. But still we felt good that we had given them a good match with 3 wins. The next map started slow with each team playing very cautiously. We got a great spawn point. Geezers started to Spam the other spawn points just as the timer reached the end of the map and scored a couple of lucky hits.<br>It was unbelievable that we won. We took the map and tied the match at 4 wins apiece. We survived and now we decided we weren’t going to lose.<br><br>The Final MAP...!<br><br>Tied at 4 wins apiece it was anyone’s match. The map started and the OGzr Ghost Recon Team moved out. We spammed a spawn point and got a lucky kill. Knowing where the other 2 team were we took an aggressive position one where we could attack from. Ahead of us there were sounds of gunfire and massive explosions similar to the SHOCK and AWE campaign unleashed by the U.S. in Iraq. AOW and CGI were battling hard, still we waited. Cautiously like a predator, while our enemies killed themselves. After a few minutes of silence we move out on the final attack. Cint got shot but was able to communicate with me where he was. Lt.Sam killed the enemy while Dent and Wild Flanked the other side. With 2 CGI and no AOW left alive, the Geezers attacked.<br><br>The VICTORY...!<br><br>With seconds left on the clock The OGzr's cornered the last remaining CGI players. Lt.Sam got killed by a sniper who was near Wild. Wild saw the tracers and found the enemy. With a single bullet Wild extinguished the CGI sniper... Victory was ours...!<br><br>Final score [OGzr]5 / CGI 4 / AOW 4<br><br>THE END...!<br><br><br></p>

Only one team will claim the Gold Medal.<br><br>Top Thud, 30+ and the [Ogzr]’s squared off in a three-way slugfest that lasted 8 maps. Each team needing the points to climb the TCZ ladder, each team playing for bragging right. <br><br>The first map ended in a draw. [Ogzr]’s and TT both scoring 4 kills to tie and 30+ wiped-out. Each team had a victory on the second, third and forth maps. With the score tied up at one win apiece, and a long night ahead of us, it was now time to get down and dirty. With our game faces on, the [OGzr]'s moved out of their spawn points like an elite Military unit. Alpha Squad, Cint and Stat, Bravo Squad, Wild and Nix and Charlie Squad, Dent and Lt.Sam. Alpha Moved out to the right on most maps and Charlie moving to the left. In a Pincer style of play we squeezed our enemy close together and forced them into the trap, where Bravo Squad was waiting. The Team played extremely well. All team members scored kills and supported their teammate with covering fire. Top Thud and 30+ also played well, but for them, it was a bloody and brutal night. The [OGzr]Ghost Recon Team Shock and Awe style of play overwhelmed both their defenses and it allowed us to roll through. <br><br>History is written by the Victor and on Friday night the [OGzr]'s were the Victor.<br><br>The final score was [OGzr]'s 5, [TT] 1 and [30+] 1.<br><br><br>Recap: It was a great night of gaming with 2 other great clans..

The Geezers started out well with a win on the first map but =SW= stormed back to win the next two. The battle raged on as the Geezers found themselves pulling yet again ahead of their opponent. Stat scored an impressive 3 kills on one map to help pull the Geezers ahead. Dent also dropped the enemy while flanking their positions. =SW= was not finished. They won the next two maps tying the match at 4 . After two consecutive draws the Geezers found themselves up against the ropes. The last and final map was Beach. The Geezers spawned on the high ground. Wild went on the offensive killing two =SW=. Cint also scored a kill as he naded the enemy tango up against the corner wall. With the Geezers up the =SW= team now had to move out on the offensive if they were to tie up this map or have a chance of winning it. =SW=Thrashe went on the offensive. Dent met him as he was charging up the ramp on the beach side of the map. In a hail of bullets Dent fell. Thrashe was the last enemy opponent left and he was making it tough. Now behind our lines Thrashe had to be stopped.. Lt.Sam ran to cut off Thrashe and block his escape. Near the edge wall Lt.Sam waited for the unsuspecting Thrashe to run by. With his reticule tight on the corner Lt.Sam sighted his target and quickly dropped his opponent. Victory was ours as the last =SW= player fell to his death. <br><br>This win was the 5th in a row for the Geezer Group. The win was worth 3 points but since the 15th game dropping was also a 3 pointer the Ogzr Ghost Recon Team remains strong in the top ten while only one win away from 5th place.<br><br>This win was a TOTAL TEAM VICTORY..!<br></p>

Now we hold a higher rank position.<br><br>Last nights win was not an easy one. Team MERC is an outstanding team with mature leadership and good sportsmanship. We stepped on the battlefield ready to battle. The first map went to MERC. They came to win starting out fast and furious, But the OGzr were just getting settled and the next 4 maps went to the Home team. Through out the match the OGrzs' played very well. We were executing battle plans, moving in squad formations and using comms as an elite fighting force. JR was racking up kill after kill. Dent and Wild provided cover fire as we moved, both scoring kills when needed. Stat and Cint make up the Alpha Squad. Moving to the left they provided support and flanking movements at key intervals during the match. <br>The 6th map was taken by MERC in a desperate attempt to stay alive. Using the MM1 effectively and cutting Alpha Squad up. The Last map was one of our home maps, Vilnius. Charlie Squad, consisting of Lt.Sam and Dent moved up the street fast. As soon as we reached the end we found ourselves in a fierce battle with MERC. After killing a MERC player Lt.Sam moved back under the cover fire from Dent. After re-grouping with Dent Charlie Squad moved back up the street on the offensive. A lucky grenade toss by Lt. killed another MERC and again a grenade toss towards the archway under the buildings eliminated an unsuspecting MERC player. With 3 kills under their belt Charlie Sq moved towards the end of the road to provide support to Bravo and Alpha.<br><br>In the end only one MERC player was left, cut off and alone, we showed no mercy as we left his busted body bleeding and in pieces on the street corner in a small town called Vilinus.<br><br>This win places the <b>OGzr Ghost Recon team in 6th place</b> out of 49 registered teams in the TCZ.<br><br><i>.......To Be Continued</i></p>

We placed our friendships aside to duke it out with a <b>top</b> clan, a group of highly skilled players. <br><br>The team consisted of JR, Dent, Wild and Lt.Sam. Right from the get-go it was down and dirty. 30+ came out firing, taking the first map. That only enraged Dent, and pissed off Wild. The Geezers came back not only winning the next map but we took the next 3. With a commanding lead of 3 to 1, the Geezers experienced the <b>fog</b> of war on the next map losing it to 30+. Lt.Sam was the first to fall, then JR. After that Wild and Dent felt it was time to get down and dirty, but 30+ was hunkered down defending their position and defeated us. With the momentum changing in their favor, 30+ won the next map. Now tied up at 3 the Geezers awoke to find themselves backed into a corner. It was getting ugly... real ugly. Even our comms weren't pretty. With the F-word, B-word, Mother-F@&#en word and the C-word fully in use. This would have made Stat cry! It was time to draw the line.. <b>here and now</b>! We lost the last 3 matches to 30+ and we decided we weren't going to lose this one.<br><br>We stood our ground and on the next map we tied. We stopped their winning streak, now its time to take back our pride. Winning the next map, the geezers found themselves up again. Now the score is 4-3. We were playing the best we could and up against a very good team... but they weren't finished yet. 30+ won the next map. Tied at 4 the next map would decide our fate.<br><br>We battled hard getting the kills we desperately needed to stay alive. 30+ came at us with everything they had and still we battled hard. Now some 2 1/2 hours into the match we found ourselves again fighting for our lives and our honor. We battled the next 4 maps only to <b>draw</b> on all 4 of them.<br><br>The final map. It was Military Camp. We spawned at Red. Dent and Wild took a defensive position on our right side as JR started grenading the left corners. I went inside to cover the camp and left side. We battled. 2 geezers down 2 30+ down... the final charge... We stood our ground. We won the map and the match.<br><br>There were no heros, just a <b>total team victory!</b><br><br>This win is worth 3 points securing the [OGzr] at <b><a href="http://www.thecombatzone.net/tcz_modules.php?op=modload&name=Team_Standings&file=index&ladder=GRT" target="_blank">9th Place</a></b> on the TCZ ladder.</p>

New member Dent played well . the RWG team went to 4 maps to 3 on the Geezer team. Not to be denied the squad won the next map pulliing even on maps 4-4. Then the match winning map came up. It was Village. The Geezer team got the bad spawn and was down players in a blink of the eye. This left JR all alone and pinned down. He was not to be denied and defeated 4 of their players alone to win the match for the Geezer team. This puts the team in a good spot to break into the top 10 at TCZ.<br> The OGzr team welcomes new members Wild and Dent to the team</p>

[OGzr] bolted out of the starting gate on Village, where LtSam scored early gun and grenade kills, and was slain as he capped his third enemy.  Stat added a kill, and JR was talked-onto-target to kill the remaining enemy with an expertly thrown grenade.  LtSam came right back on Castle, killing 3 enemy again.

Spawning on high ground, JR and Tracker6 teamed up with 1 kill each on the near-spawn corridor, while Stat and Vaulden blocked up the far corridor, each with a kill.  JR finished the map by killing the sole remaining bad guy.<br><br>After an extended "intermission" where *RWG* could catch their breath, [OGzr] returned to lose the next 4 maps straight.  Aurora and Ghost Town were disappointing losses...possibly a symptom of being over-confident on maps that [OGzr] feels comfortable with.  After adding a sixth player to each side, *RWG* took Market and Night Castle before Old Geezers regrouped on Battlefield.  Vaulden and Stat aggressively hunted the enemy and killed 2 each.  LtSam iced another enemy to leave the remaining *RWG* player alone and outnumbered.  As [OGzr] reduced their perimeter, the bad guy exposed himself by firing at LtSam, and Tracker6 zoomed in on an easy target.<br><br>Tied at 4-4...the teams spawned on the expected rubber match, Mountain.  [OGzr] went down quickly, and with time running out, it looked like *RWG* would maintain a 1 player advantage.  Alas, LtSam scored a well-placed shot to force the match to another map.  On River, the map progressed similarly, with [OGzr] suffering a 1 man deficit...until JR tossed an amazing grenade long-distance with 2 minutes left to force another map.  Unfortunately, even though [OGzr] took the lead early on Roadblock, *RWG* showed true perseverance and edged out a win.<br><br>The match was one of the most spirited in recent [OGzr] history...we tip our caps to *RWG*, a well-disciplined and fun opponent.

The Old Geezers succeeded at accomplishing this objective...but walked away empty-handed (yet again) as their rest-home compadres scored another win.<br><br>There was no slow start tonight, as the teams spawned a stone's throw away from each other on Riverbed.  JR saw three separate enemy within his field of view, but was gunned down before he could switch off his weapon's safety.  Trakcer6 scored a lucky grenade kill while the enemy loitered at their spawn point, but was then quickly silenced.  Later, Statilius managed to ice a bad guy, but it was not enough as even he was hunted down. [OGzr] showed signs of life on the following night map, Airbase, and scored a win by taking down all of [30+] without suffering a single casualty.  JR took aim out of a high window to score two kills, and LtSam also notched 2 kills from his sniper rifle.<br><br>With the score tied at 1-1, Old Geezers appeared poised to take another win on Prison, but a last-minute rush by [30+] forced a draw.  The enemy demonstrated excellent patience on Plantation, even in the face of Stat and JR scoring consecutive kills by working around the far road.  [OGzr] turned out another draw on Roadblock.  Stat scored an early kill on the road, and LtSam followed with a long-range sniper round.  Tracker6 bottled up the northern gap with 1 gun kill and another grenade kill.  Unfortunately, The Geezers ran out of steam, and suffered 3 map loses in a row on Bridges, River and Red Square (even with Cintilious' gun and grenade kill on Red Square, it seems like this communist map is the curse of [OGzr]).<br><br>Matching with [30+] continues to be fun and rewarding...but it appears after consecutive loses, it's time for The Geezers to adjust tactics.

With only 1 enemy left, Stat moved into commanding terrain, and was able to maintain cover while the lone *CoRe* player stalked the remaining Geezers.  Stat added the final kill of the map, bringing [OGzr] their first map win of the night.<br><br>On Day Farm, it appeared as if the Geezers would maintain momentum.  JR silenced 2 enemy, but a rogue sniper hugged the ground, killing T6, LtSam and JR, before Cint was left to fend for himself.  Before Mountain Stronghold, *CoRe* StoneCold joined to make the final 2 maps of the night 5v5.  This turned out to be a bad omen for [OGzr]...for even though Stat killed 2 enemy on the map, StoneCold unleashed his fury, killing 4 [OGzr] and pulling a draw out of thin air.

It was a team effort. Due to the size of the match it broke down to two teams  subbing. Newcomer Slimwit played well. He got the needed kills and provided accurate intelligence when needed. All players played well and the group worked as a team. Let's keep this up and get some more wins. this puts us at 35th spot on timed and 19th at rumble. Good games</p>

Coming off of a very productive training camp with Clan FR last week, the Geezers immediately put into action its position strategy.  The squad went up 1, then went even; went up 1, then went back to even; and finally, went up for the third time of the round, and managed to win on time.  JR had an impressive 3 kills (2 shots, one grenade).<br><br>The following two rounds of RRBridge went progressively worse for the Geezers...in fact, Round 3 was a genuine slaughter (all six Geezers killed, all six Recon Battalion shooters sill alive)!  Indeed, Recon Battalion adapted well to the opening round, and ended up dominating the map.<br><br>The final two rounds played on Recon Battalion's choice of maps, Caves.  Round 4 was ugly; the Old Ones had poor spawn placement, and Recon Battalion showed their true mastery of sniping from what seemed like all directions (PaleRider scored the only kill).  The final round was much more even, but [OGzr] was no match for the enemy snipers.<br><br>The high quality of their Clan webpage (<a href="http://recon.rabidd.com">http://recon.rabidd.com</a> ) turned out to be quite indicative of the high quality of their Ghost Recon game play.  Recon Battalion is a professional team, we look forward to a future firefight soon.<br></p>

By Round #4, [OGzr] was truly warmed up...the squad locked down the map and [OGzr]s Viagra and Cint commanded a 2v1 advantage for most of the round.  Again, [OGzr]Viagra's patience paid off, as he scored the final cap to put *AP to rest.  Unfortunately, *AP came back with a vengeance for the final round, and slowly picked off the Geezers one-by-on, until only [OGzr]LTSam was boxed in and finally gunned down.<br><br>American Patriots *AP was definitely a class act...though [OGzr]sfpops would likely disagree with their political courtesy!

OMG, what have we gotten into!  [JAG]Joey was unstoppable, killing Pale, Cint, Cart, sfpops and T6...and even killing one of his own in the rampage.  Thankfully, the Geezers got their heart-pacer batteries recharged during the intermission.<br><br>Round 2:  Geezers score two kills during a much more even match.  Pale Rider stalked to the second floor of a corner building to score a sniping kill, and Tracker6 put his 7.62 carbine to work at long range while an enemy ditty-bopped down the street; but in the end, [JAG] came away with their second win.<br><br>Round 3:  Geezers choose Plantation as the next map...and it pays off.  sfpops scored a very solid 3 kills, and Pale Rider turned in another 2 to finish off [JAG].  Geezers worked a good checkerboard pattern to cover all avenues on the map, and used team communication well to identify enemy locations.<br><br>Round 4:  A heartbreaking tie, where a Geezer 2 v 1 advantage was lost with one second left in the round!!  Pale Rider and T6 went down quickly...then sfpops began to snipe like a king!  Unfortunately, he went out at the last second, leaving Cint as the lone Geezer.<br><br>Round 5:  Another well played and even match, with some [JAG] players claiming it to be the most nerve wracking match they'd ever played; they come out with a close win.<br><br>It was a good battle, we look forward to our next run-in with the classy folks from [JAG].<br></p>
