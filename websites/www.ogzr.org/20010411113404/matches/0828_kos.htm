        Who woulda’ thunk it…a Title Shot for the Geezers!! Cynicism aside,
        the squad was charged up from the beginning, in spite of the Tempest map
        choice.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Round 1</b>: A quick touch for the [OGzr] offense side,
        then…shutdown! <a href="http://www.clankos.com/" target="_blank">|KoS|</a>
        demonstrated tenacious teamwork, especially by attacking water and
        flinging conc’s like they were going outta’ style. Geezer defenders
        held their turf, but the overwhelming waves of |KoS| meds and scouts was
        too much. Final tally: 165-3.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Round 2</b>: After a brief cry in mIRC and some strategy adjustment,
        Geezers took the battlefield with much better success. A quick cap and
        early lead seemed promising, thanks to VitD’s persistence. An
        adjustment of SGs in the FR and Reaper going banzai as HWG seemed to
        improve the performance. But, alas, |KoS| brought out the spies, stepped
        up their defensive coordination, and started to put some caps together.
        Final run: 63-15.<br>
        <br>
        |KoS| was an extremely mature bunch of gamers, and even though they
        bloodied the Geezers this round, we look forward to a future meeting.
        Hats off to their class act.</td>
