        Round one remained quite tight throughout…score tied at one, then at
        two. [OGzr] defense was able to lock-down several times after the flag
        was on the move. <a target="_blank" href="http://smpclan.clanpages.com/index.html">[SMP]</a>
        used an army of snipers and HWGs to bloody the midfield…but alas,
        Geezer teamwork pulled through once again. Final tally: 3-2.<br>
        <br>
        Geezers returned to the field for round two much pumped up. Having
        dropped a player, [SMP] pulled back the tight midfield defense…but the
        day was not to be theirs! Geezers continued to push relentlessly through
        the tunnel, making solid use of spies, and keeping constant pressure on
        the switch. At the bell: 7-1, making the total score [OGzr] 10, [SMP] 3.<br>
        <br>
        We had a blast playing with the guys from [SMP]…good luck in your
        quest with TFC.!
