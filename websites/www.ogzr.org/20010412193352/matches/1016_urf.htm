        The Old Geezers and <a href="http://clanurf.cjb.net/" target="_blank">United
        Resistance Front</a> started off without a hitch. Very nice indeed. [URF]
        grabbed our flag quickly and capped early. They kept the pressure on and
        about the halfway point had a 2-3 lead. The Old Geezers not wanting to
        beat down, came back with a vengeance. They setup defense on the bridge
        and went to work on the offense. It was a very tough round for all of
        us. Ending the round at 5-5. Whew!
        <p>After a ten minute break we got right back into it. We don't screw
        around with multiple restarts which was very nice. Thanks for being a
        very mature clan, [URF].</p>
        <p>Round 2 started off even faster. Before I could detonate their
        tunnel, they had our flag. Surprisingly enough, my detpack not only took
        out the tunnel, but destroyed their sentry too. Oooops. The battle went
        back and forth with both teams owning the bridge. [URF] kept better hold
        of the bridge in round two. They moved into an early lead and setup a
        wall of defense on the bridge. They had the win for sure, when [OGzr]
        just wouldn't quit. We gave them all we had. When the dust had settled,
        3-5 was the score. Total score 8-10.</p>
        <p>United Resistance Front wins. Great Game Guys!&nbsp; You are a very
        mature and classy clan. Hope to frag you soon!</p>
