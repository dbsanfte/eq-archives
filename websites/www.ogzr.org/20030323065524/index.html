Coming off of a very productive training camp with Clan FR last week, the Geezers immediately put into action its position strategy.  The squad went up 1, then went even; went up 1, then went back to even; and finally, went up for the third time of the round, and managed to win on time.  JR had an impressive 3 kills (2 shots, one grenade).<br><br>The following two rounds of RRBridge went progressively worse for the Geezers...in fact, Round 3 was a genuine slaughter (all six Geezers killed, all six Recon Battalion shooters sill alive)!  Indeed, Recon Battalion adapted well to the opening round, and ended up dominating the map.<br><br>The final two rounds played on Recon Battalion's choice of maps, Caves.  Round 4 was ugly; the Old Ones had poor spawn placement, and Recon Battalion showed their true mastery of sniping from what seemed like all directions (PaleRider scored the only kill).  The final round was much more even, but [OGzr] was no match for the enemy snipers.<br><br>The high quality of their Clan webpage (<a href="http://recon.rabidd.com">http://recon.rabidd.com</a> ) turned out to be quite indicative of the high quality of their Ghost Recon game play.  Recon Battalion is a professional team, we look forward to a future firefight soon.<br></p>

Only [OGzr]Viagra showed any promise with the sole Geezer kill during Round #1, and staying alive for the longest in Round #2 (though, all five Geezers took a dirt nap after less than two minutes of gameplay!).<br><br>Round #3 on OGzr's choice (Plantation) showed signs of promise.  The Geezers were able to cap 2 Patriots, and movement/control of the map was better coordinated.  By Round #4, [OGzr] was truly warmed up...the squad locked down the map and [OGzr]s Viagra and Cint commanded a 2v1 advantage for most of the round.  Again, [OGzr]Viagra's patience paid off, as he scored the final cap to put *AP to rest.  Unfortunately, *AP came back with a vengeance for the final round, and slowly picked off the Geezers one-by-on, until only [OGzr]LTSam was boxed in and finally gunned down.<br><br>American Patriots *AP was definitely a class act...though [OGzr]sfpops would likely disagree with their political courtesy!  Hey...Bush did win, 'ya know?!  GG *AP.<br></p>

OMG, what have we gotten into!  [JAG]Joey was unstoppable, killing Pale, Cint, Cart, sfpops and T6...and even killing one of his own in the rampage.  Thankfully, the Geezers got their heart-pacer batteries recharged during the intermission.<br><br>Round 2:  Geezers score two kills during a much more even match.  Pale Rider stalked to the second floor of a corner building to score a sniping kill, and Tracker6 put his 7.62 carbine to work at long range while an enemy ditty-bopped down the street; but in the end, [JAG] came away with their second win.<br><br>Round 3:  Geezers choose Plantation as the next map...and it pays off.  sfpops scored a very solid 3 kills, and Pale Rider turned in another 2 to finish off [JAG].  Geezers worked a good checkerboard pattern to cover all avenues on the map, and used team communication well to identify enemy locations.<br><br>Round 4:  A heartbreaking tie, where a Geezer 2 v 1 advantage was lost with one second left in the round!!  Pale Rider and T6 went down quickly...then sfpops began to snipe like a king!  Unfortunately, he went out at the last second, leaving Cint as the lone Geezer.<br><br>Round 5:  Another well played and even match, with some [JAG] players claiming it to be the most nerve wracking match they'd ever played; they come out with a close win.<br><br>It was a good battle, we look forward to our next run-in with the classy folks from [JAG].<br></p>

They had engaged a Senior Guard and the battle was going well when Sabanizi yelled that she was under attack. Chracner spun to face this new enemy. Rage filled his heart as he saw the much dreaded enemy of the Ancients Captain Bvellos beating on Sab. Without regard for personal safety he rushed in and landed a flying kick to get Bvellos's attention. Chracner's staff and feet worked as one as they landed blow after blow on this hated foe. Alas he was out matched, not only in size but in fighting ability. All that kept him standing were the magics of his friends and pure hatred of Bvellos.<br><br>It was then that Chracner heard a loud crash behind him and knew that help was coming. With the guard dead the rest of the Ancients fell upon Bvellos like a pack of ravenous wolves. For the first time in thier rivaled past Bvellos knew fear. He turned to flee but the ice beneath his feet cracked as vines and roots broke through to entangle him. As he fell he uttered a prayer that fell on the uncaring ears of Rallos Zek. He had been forsaken......</p>

The kind of trust one can only put in their closest friends.<br><br>Our heros, Saxmoore, Halicia, Jovvi, Sindaria, Chracner, and Miss, yes Miss. It seems like only yesterday we saw little Miss killing no name monsters on the planes of the Overthere and now to see her deep in the heart of Old Sebelis seemed kind of odd. Barely out of the food her mother had packed for her when she left the great city of Halas, to be traveling with the likes of these other five battle hardened heros was an adventure in itself.<br><br>Alas, were our adventure to end with the journey itself it would have grand enough, but it did not. <br><br>Down the twisting halls they battled, monster after monster, they faught, to the very entrance of what the old timers fondly call "the Disco". At the entrance they were stalled, Chracner lay flat on his back daring not move for fear he would bring the wrath of the froglok nation down upon them. The battle raged around him as he lay there helpless to offer anything save advise. The only things standing in the way of total destruction and an end to the adventure were a young barbarian rogue named Miss and trust. Her trust that the others would not let her fall and their trust that she would not quit, not run, not fail in the task they had appointed her.....<br><br>Oh what battles they faught. Everyone had a place and knew what it was. Everyone faught like true heros.<br><br> These rare moments when you only have your faith to guide you, it is nice to have someone to put that faith in......Dremarian</p>

    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Standing in the Nexus, our band of adventurers commited to a course. This night, the Plane of Disease would be explored even at the cost of our lives if need be. The brave souls at the beginning of the journey included Marloon, talented mage and master of the elements; Baron Saxmoore, the powerful wizard and leader of our small army; Baronness (?) Cristineiya, the druid, one with nature and bearer of formidable earthen magics; Halicia, faithful vicar and restorer of life; Sindaria, the beguiling Enchantress, able to fascinate and charm the worst of beasts long enough for us to vanquish their brethren; and myself, a humble Cavalier of Marr, ready to bear the brunt of whatever onslaught we might face in that blighted place.<br><br>After speaking to the keeper of the gateway to the outskirts of Bertoxx' plane to get clearance to enter, we all leapt into the gate itself, a huge foul-looking spigot, ever flowing with unnatural murky waters. We arrived in the graveyard of this dark humid place, surrounded by the corpses of other adventurers, a warning perhaps? This was a hideous place, sticky fetid humid, with an evil odor drifting from the rivers of waste that flow thru it. We made our way thru the huge hairs growing out of the ground, past several other brave souls, til we found a clearing near a nest of venomous spiders. I set off to bring one to us and its offspring, which I hadn't seen, came as well. To our shock these evil beasts tend to wield magics almost as powerful as our own, so our Enchantress had to weave her spell of fascination on one, keeping it enthralled as we destroyed the other. Marloon's elemental servant fought valiantly as I kept the attention of the huge arachnid. Halicia saved my life many times over, completely healing me as this vicious....thing, tore into my armored form. Cristineiya while summoning thorny vines to shield me and damage the beast, also managed to patch a wound that might have killed me seconds before Halicia's healing could take effect, thus once again saving the life of this humble knight. Finally, with a devastating blast from our wizard we vanquished the more powerful of the 2 and went to work destroying its foul offspring. This went on in similar fashion for a time, until a crafty pair of spiders finally got the better of me, as one held my attention as it's cunning sibling relentlessly attacked our beloved healer. It refused to be deterred even by Sindaria's considerable enchantments. I swore beneath my breath as I turned, much too late, to see faithful Halicia fall to its fangs. Vowing vengeance, I shouted to Baron Saxmoore to call upon his magics to whisk the others clear as I too fell to their attack, mercilessly struck down from behind by the original monster....<br><br>Later after Halicia called on her(his) powers to revive us, we ventured out again, unfortunately without the assistance of the mage Marloon, but we attracted the attention of an outrider of considerable experience who was exploring the area on his own, traveling under the name of Breowan. He assisted us in ridding the area of scores of its revolting inhabitants, including different varieties of tsetsian flies, larvae, and vile pox-ridden disease infested rats. He fell valiantly at one point in the battle as well but Halicia speedily returned him to the fight. All in all, I think we made our mark on this foul place, though it did seem to mock us as we left and more vile fiends appeared to replace those we laid waste to...<br><br>(as you can see, it's a slow day at work. long story short we went to PoD camped spiders, whacked em, me and Hali died once, then mar left and breowan was tryin to solo where we were pulling from. we took all spawns so he joined our group. He died once, then we killed stuff til we got sleepy and left......Jaimekash</p>

Island one went great and we got our keys with no problems at all. We then moved to island two and the home of Gwan, our target. <br><br>Everyone was in the wind mill which is the center piece for this tiny island, they were all buffed as planned, this is the last thing that went right for the team. <br><br>The plan was for Gymli to aggro Gwan and pull him into the wind mill where everyone else would kill him. Chrac did the hand in, said the magic words, and the fun began. Gymli got Gwan to the ramp then got blown backwards off the island and out of the zone. Dan took over as MA and we proceeded to hack him good. Then Dan gets summoned outside on a bad pathing deal and blown off the island. Now here is where things get realy crazy. Chracner and Graphyte start ping ponging Gwan back and forth until finally Chracner gets blown out of the mill and off the island. Now if you are keepin score, Chracner is the reason they went to this place, and now they have lost not 1 but 3 tanks from the main group. Now at this point most weaker souls would have packed their bags and took the leap off the side off the island, but not our team. Graphyte, who for the record is ten levels lower then Gwan, gave him a timely 650 point Harm touch to get its his attention, and group two, with the tattered remains of one took it to the hoop. <br><br>Now some would say that we are weak for having had it get that out of control. I say we did it our way and won. That was quite possibly 5 minutes of the most intense fighting I have seen in game to date, and I had to watch most of it on anothers screen because I was out of the fight. Some were lost through no fault of their own, they gave their lives for the cause. I solute you all, I am proud to stand among your ranks and be called an Ancient.</p>

I will have to tell you I had great concerns as we faught our way to the very foot of the great Ssraeshza temple in the center of the zone. Once there my mind was put at ease as this band twisted and turned and conformed into one leathal killing machine. Arm to arm with their back to the temple they layed waste to all that dared near them. <br><br>I dont know that I learned the reason that folks go to the Grey, it is a frightening place no matter the company. I did not take home the riches and loot the great items of mythe that are said to be had in this zone. I did however learn something, something very valuable. Standing at the base of that temple, side by side with these great people, I learned what it meant to be an Ancient of the Realm. They are much more then what they appear, alone they may be nothing, but when they are together they are a force to be reckoned with. They are much more then the strength of their steel and the power of their magic. Their strength goes much deeper than that. They are friends.............</p>

Anyway... here's <b>T9</b>'s wrap-up:<br><br>August 23, 2002: OLD GEEZERS CELEBRATE (BELATEDLY) THREE YEARS OF PROSPERITY AND GROWTH<br><br>As the flurry of Geezer-gaming continued in to its third year of existence...we collectively felt a pang of shock and regret upon reading SlimWit's post on the Forum: HOW COULD WE FORGET?!!  Imagine the personal tragedy that befalls those unforgiven spouses who have committed the egregious sin of overlooking their wedding anniversary.  Quickly, upon realizing that our founding date had passed, the Old Geezers resolved to recognize the momentous occasion with a most befitting event, an All-Comers game of the saga that started it all three years ago: Team Fortress Classic.<br><br>And so, they came by the dozens (about two-dozen, to be more precise!).  Well before game time, Geezers were found loitering on our mIRC channel, waiting to check in and bid each other "Happy Anniversary".   [OGzr] mAdmOnk is reputed to boast the record of at least six-hours prior to game time (of course, he had the UK advantage working for him!).  After catching up on old news...who had new kids, who had a new job, who had been in jail...it was off to our very own Walker Wars server, graciously administered by [OGzr] JackhOle, and loaded with all our favorite maps.<br><br>'Lo...this was no organized, disciplined practice session in the traditional Geezer vane!  While the initial rust of re-learning old moves, positions and strategies was highly evident, the skills, camaraderie and teamwork seemed to come back quickly.  By the time "Well" was loaded, Geezers seemed to be coming back into old form, with strong defenses set-up around the FR, and routinely ferocious movement of the flag once it had been dropped to the bottom.  Crossover and Shutdown2 proved to be as enjoyable as always (though the concs just didn't seem as refined)...and 2Mesa3 proved as frustrating as it was the first day we practiced on that map!  So, it was fitting that with the clock approaching midnight for our East Coast bretheren, Geezers took their leave back to mIRC to talk smack about who crowbarred and wrenched who, and to say their goodnights.<br><br>We've come a long way: from TFC, to CS...to EQ and Tribes 2 (and don't forget Gang Wars!).  It's been a hell of a ride.  We can be proud that after three years of prosperity, Old Geezers from all of our Clan's generations returned on the Anniversary to experience what makes us unique in the Gaming community: maturity, camaraderie...and our trademark canes and wheelchairs!  See you next year.<br><br><a href="http://marz.org/cgi/mmartian/ogzr/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=1&t=001050"><i>Be sure to add your comments in the forum!</i></a><br></p>

Although a few persons short, 57th showed their resolve and played on through some great battles.<br><br>First map: Katabatic. Starting off with a flourish, 57th got the first touch on the flag, and the race was on. A tough 57th Offense made the Old Ones have to backup a step and put the brakes on the flag grabs. Some good midfield work on the part of both teams made the match a good one. However, when the dust settled, the Old Geezers were able to pull an 8-2 win.<br><br>Next was Sanctuary. The 57th Defense made our cappers earn every step of our attempts to capture the flag. 57th pulled one cap, but then our D held solid, and was able to get the flag back each time it disappeared from the stand. By the time the clock ran out, the Old Geezers had again won the map, but not without a hard fight. OGzr 2-1.<br><br>Last was Drifts(x), a new map to the BEML. After making sure that everyone was ready to go, the final map started, and 57th came out charging. Flying cappers everywhere. The Defense pulled up their Depends, and held fast to the flag. Meanwhile, mortars were flying around the 57th base, and our cappers were stopped numerous times at the flag stand. The OGzr Offense stepped it up a bit, and was able to pull a few flags out of the base and back home. OGzr 4-0.<br><br>Our hats off to the 57th group. They fought well, and are a great addition to the BEML. We wish them well, and hope to play them again soon.</p>

The scrim helped us to welcome MA into the TIW program with BEML, as well as to get some good games going!<br><br>Started on Harvester(x), where the MA Offense just kept coming and coming... old bodies tried to defend as best they could, but apparently our Depends gave out, and MA took the map by a shutout / cap out.<br>Next was Sanctuary, and we were warned that MA was good at capping out this map. The old ones held their ground, and only allowed a few caps after the bomber of doom hovered overhead. This map goes to MA also.<br>Final map was Slapdash(x). After losing a few Geezers to sleepiness, the game was on. With a fresh set of Depends and Viagra in our veins, the old ones were able to pull off a series of caps and get a shutout of their own.<br><br>Great games were had, and we appreciate MA allowing us to host on our server. It got a workout! We look forward to our next matchup with them.</p>

The modified Quagmire map worked well with the Old Men launching out a fast assault while the Defense deployed and parked a Juggernaut on the flag to stay! The persistant EW Offense managed a few grabs, but couldn't pull off the full carry home. OGzr capped a shutout on EW 6-0. <br><br>The next map was Sanctuary and once again (after a few Geritol pills and Ensure chasers) the Old Farts were up to the task. EW came in hot and quick, taking down OGzr's gens and sending the D scrambling. EW was kind enough to return our flag after taking home for a moment. Not bad for being a few players down. The caps however, ended there. OGzr Offense redoubled efforts and pulled off 4 complete flag carries before time ran out. 4-1 OGzr win.<br><br>Thanks for coming out EW!<br></p>
