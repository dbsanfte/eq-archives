        We met clan <a href="http://teamidc.clanpages.com/" target="_blank">[IDC]</a>
        tonight for another lesson of how to win in a league match, at all
        costs. Both rounds were played on Walker Wars as [IDC]'s server was
        unavailable. The map was cs_docks with a 30 minute time limit.
        <p><b>Round 1<br>
        </b>Geezers played CTs, [IDC] played Ts. The Geezers came out guns a-blazin'.
        Apparently, with old age comes bad eyesight as we couldn't seem to put
        them [IDC] boys in their place. [IDC] camped the roof exclusively and it
        gave them a strong edge tactically. Ended with a 13 to 1 lead for [IDC].</p>
        <p><b>Round 2<br>
        </b>Time for the Geezers to take advantage of the Terrorist friendly
        map.&nbsp; One problem, however: it was as if the CTs didn't come for
        the game. [IDC] decided to take advantage of a league technicality and
        not bother trying to rescue the hostages. The Geezers just sat there,
        protecting hostages, getting older with every passing minute. This was
        the longest, slowest, and most boring round we have ever played. While
        we find their tactics to be fully legal, we feel they are not in
        following with the spirit of the game. It's a shame the game played out
        that way. But in the end, we won 6 to 1, for a total of 14 to 7.</p>
        <p>On the plus side. Rice (of [IDC]) came to our IRC channel and
        apologized after the match. I doubt they will change their ways. We
        should probably expect more of this style of play from our opponents in
        the future.</p>
