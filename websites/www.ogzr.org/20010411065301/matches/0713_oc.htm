    	The Geezers came out in full force and had a great time playing a CS match against
        <a href="http://www.ocoutcasts.homestead.com/main.html" target="_blank">[oC]</a>. The Geezers came out on top during both games, with scores of 13:5 and 26:2. To 
    	[oC]'s credit, they were a great bunch of guys who showed good attitudes throughout, even 
    	though they were playing one short for the entire match. Near the second round end, one 
    	of their players had to leave, leaving them two members short. Both [OGzr] and [oC] had 
    	a great time playing together and finished up the evening by congratulating one another 
    	on a game well played.<BR><BR>
		[OGzr] truly shined on this evening in a way not completely reflected by its score. We 
		reached a new height in teamwork and communication through pre-game strategies and the 
		use of Roger Wilco. Good job Geezers! Let's get some more of those trophies! Them is shiny.</td>
