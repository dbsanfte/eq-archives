        Both rounds were played on the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/silentdevil/" target="_blank">Mercenary
        Outpost</a> server where pings were not far apart. Server settings were
        NOT STA, but we played anyway.<br>

        <b>Round 1</b>: Geezers as Ts, Mercs as CTs.<br>
        The round began with almost no warning and caught we Geezers off guard,
        but that did not stop us. We pulled to a quick lead. But it didn't last
        long. After a couple of their members dropped and rejoined (with higher
        pings) they started bringing the pain. Their amazing accuracy brought
        them back to a round win at 14 to 9.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Round 2</b>: Geezers as CTs, Mercs as Ts:<br>
        This round started bad for the Geezers. While we couldn't hit a bottle
        of metemucil if it was right in front of us, their accuracy was good
        enough to puncture a colostomy bag at 100 yards. We lost each round big
        and bold as they always seemed knew where we were. After the first eight
        or so losses, we realized that we couldn't count on being able to get to
        the timer in time, so we just tried to kill them all. The round ended in
        a 13 to 3 loss for the Geezers.<br>
        <br>
        This match showed an interesting result of our practices. Each and every
        one of us went to our positions and did what we were supposed to do.
        Damn fine job of that, but the other team was still able to kill us, no
        matter what we did. Just goes to show, a superior plan and a group of
        great players can still be beaten if the other team takes the right
        steps.
