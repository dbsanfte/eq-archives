        Meeting up on the [OGzr] server, we girded our loins for some heated action…
        <p>Round 1, the Geezers seemed well coordinated on Offense, and scored consecutive caps with well-organized rushes. While pairs of Geezers conc’ed, grabbed, and gradually worked the flag back, the Aged Defense held very tight. Heavy yard defenders stemmed the xD| offense, and locked in a solid win (20-6, [OGzr] winner).</p>
        <p>Round 2, xD| cranked it up a notch, with some incredibly improved conc’ing inside the Geezer base. [OGzr] offense found a new challenge in meeting better placed SGs high and on the spirals. Still, the Geezer defense held their ground…the bad guys win this round (4-10, xD| winner).</p>
        <p>The Old Ones were sweating and gasping for air at the end of this one…still, a well deserved win (24-16). Hats off to xD|…we look forward to a future meeting; good luck.
