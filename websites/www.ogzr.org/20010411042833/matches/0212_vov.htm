        Location: VOV server for both rounds because of ping issues on Kane Wars<br>
        Result: Defeat
        <p><b>Round 1</b>:<br>
        Both teams lost last week but apparently learned some good lessons
        because there was no scoring for quite a while. Defenses were holding
        tight, until the internet gremlins hit. We dropped one or two guys,
        opening up a slot for VOV to yank our flag. They also snuck in a
        computer det somewhere. Later in the round, it was VOV's turn to drop a
        couple players, and our offense capitalized with our only score of the
        match. Great struggle and a close round. Final score 15-20.</p>
        <p><b>Round 2</b>:<br>
        Both teams had learned each others setup and tried to attack
        accordingly. However, VOV had considerably better success this round,
        pulling out several caps and a few dets. Meanwhile, our O was struggling
        to even touch their flag. Players were dropping on both sides for most
        of the match. Our O just couldn't get things happening and VOV locked
        down tighter and tighter until time ran out. Final score 0-55.</p>
        <p>VOV played well and were pleasant competitors. Good luck in the
        future.</p>
