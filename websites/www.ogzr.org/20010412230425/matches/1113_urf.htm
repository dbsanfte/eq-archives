        The Geezers met <a href="http://clanurf.cjb.net/" target="_blank">URF</a>
        on the field of battle for another STA face-off. We've met URF before
        and they whupped us. Since old men have nothing much to do in life
        (except shine their dentures), we practiced a little more for this
        match.
        <p>Round 1 started out with both teams in a mad rush for the flag. URF
        and OGzr both got early touches. These touches continued and many a cap
        was had by both teams. As the round wore on, URF once again showed us
        they were in charge, ending the round with a 190-160 loss.</p>
        <p>Round 2 was where the gloves came off. Then the Geezers put some ace
        bandages in their place, 'cause hey... we're old. Anyway, the Geezers
        started with a 3 scout, 1 medic rush that blew through their defense.
        URF sent a similar team our way. This round had a nearly continuous
        stream of caps for the Geezers, and a slightly slower stream for URF.
        The Geezers gummed their enemies to a round win at 250 to 130, for a
        match total win of 410 to 320.</p>
        <p>Thank you URF for the fun match. You were all gentlemen, and a
        delight to play. We look forward to meeting you again.
