Kutlachs, Kikash, Valrain and her trusty pet, and I met in Lakeshire to defeat an enemy of Stormwind and collect the devices they used to channel the Arcane.<br><br>We started with single gnolls, worked up to groups of two followed by three.  Our shining moment was a much harried battle against at least six gnolls, each our level or higher.  Everyone in the group was patient and didn't panic, and our only loss was the valiant pet Thathos.  We mourned his loss and healed in order to continue the fight.  In the end, the only death our party suffered was due to a server crash or disconnection for all and I was able to gain a level (Priest 23).  Here we are returning to camp after completing the quest.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120904/returningfrombattle.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120904/returningfrombattle.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>After cleaning up and reconciling our accounts with Lakeshire's shopkeepers, we moved just out of town to help a local inhabitant rid her garden from an unwelcome guest: Bellygrub, a huge boar.  The experience gained from this encounter was enough for Kutlachs to level (now Warrior 22). <br><br>We did very well tonight and I think our proudest moment was not panicking against larger numbers and being patient enough to keep everyone alive and kicking.</p>

    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">We put together a pretty strong group last night with Valrain (21 Hunter), Kutlachs (20 Warrior), Kikash (16 Paladin), and myself (22 Priest) to take on a couple of elite quests in Loch Modan that I wrote about <a href="#newsitem1101996285,47097,">earlier</a>.  The plan was to head out to complete the first quest and level Kikash to 17 so he could get credit for completing the Chok'sul quest.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/ogreparty.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/ogreparty.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>That strategy went well as we easily completed the first elite quest and Kikash hit the requisite level 17 for the next quest.  Additionally, we were joined by Edeilirra.  We entered the cave to battle the mighty Chok'sul.  The adventure here is best summarized by "Just like a Geezer to bring a knife to a gunfight."  <br><br>We assisted another party in their quest by handling the additional monsters besides Chok'sul before we got our chance.  We waited for Chok'sul to respawn, and waited, and waited, and waited.  Finally, he spawns with his two friends, but unbeknownst to us, two more behind us spawned.  We weren't able to handle the encounter and ended up wiping and all running on water to retrieve our corpses.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/wiped.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/wiped.gif"></IMG></A><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/runningonwater.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/runningonwater.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>So, we regrouped and tried again, and again, and again, and again.  I think we wiped at least five times.  Also, Blizzard dropped Kutlachs with their random patching mechanism and we wiped then, too.  Finally, with our equipment close to breaking, we engage a higher level party to provide covering fire for us to handle the adds.  Well, that stroke of genius proved to be very timely, as we made short order of Chok'sul and returned to town to lick our wounds.  The quest rewards were excellent and we absolutely learned a ton.<br><br>I was in need of visiting the Elf city of Darnassus to train with their Artisan Alchemist. Valrain and I took the boat to Darkshore, flew from Darkshore to Teldrassil, and ran to the Elven capital.  To cap the night off, we fished a bit before retiring.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/flyingtodarnassus.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/flyingtodarnassus.gif"></IMG></A><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/fishingwithfriends.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/fishingwithfriends.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER></p>

    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I stumbled onto an unbelievable gaming session this morning.  As some of you know, I awake at 5am to get a couple of hours of grinding and other administrative stuff done.  I don't expect much out of this time; I was <B>very</B> wrong about that this morning...this morning was on of the best times I've had in-game, yet.  It's always a pleasant surprise to group with people you don't know and actually have a fun time.  World of Warcraft is a great game and my gaming in the early hours connects me with fellow serious and mature players.<br><br>I was headed out to the East side of Loch Modan to pick up a few quests.  As I was waiting for the NPC to show up, I partied with a level 15 Dwarf Paladin so we could do the quest at the same time and not have to wait further.  We escorted the NPC to <a target=“_blank” href=http://i1.thottbot.com/Interface/WorldMap/LochModan/LochModanbig.jpg>Ironbad's Excavation Site</a> and I picked up a quest that the Paladin said he had difficulty with earlier.<br><br>We ventured into the excavation site and started knocking off some mobs, and were joined by a level 18 Night Elf Warrior.  He helped tremendously in pulling and holding aggro.  We completed that quest for all three of us, feeling rather flush with our success, I must admit.<br><br>The Dark Elf asked if we wanted to try the two Elite quests in Loch Modan and we agreed after the ease of completing the former quest.  Along the way we found a Gnome Mage and asked if he wanted to join us.  He inspected us and surmised that we'd need a lot more horsepower to survive and departed.  No hard feelings on our part, but we decided to focus on the lower of the two quests based on his feedback: <a target=“_blank” href=http://www.thottbot.com/?q=666>Mercenaries</a>.<br><br>We approached the ogre camp with some trepidation based on the Gnome's wisdom, and inched slowly against the ogres.  The Warrior pulled one and I quickly went through my mana as we defeated it.  Being out of mana as a Priest is not a good thing for the party, so I began to scale back my damage spells a bit.  We made nice progress against the quest but only because we were engaging one or two at a time.<br><br>Along came a level 23 Dark Elf Hunter and we invited him to join us.  That addition to the party really turned the tide against the ogres and we made quick work of the quest, pushed into the cave, and made the decision to go for Loch Modan's other known Elite quest: <a target=“_blank” href=http://www.thottbot.com/?q=661>WANTED: Chok'sul Alliance</a><br><br>The pace was pretty frenetic.  So much so that I don't have the normal screenshots to share with you unfortunately.  We engaged more ogres in the cave (level 19 or 20) and made it to Chok'sul's chamber, where 2 casting ogres and Chok'sul were waiting.  The fight was a long one, and I was largely in the role of healer as I should have been.  The Priest's Power Word: Shield was invaluable to our survival.  After eliminating his companions, we focused on Chok'sul and defeated him with tanks at 50% health and a dead pet for the Hunter who was a true hero in the engagement.<br><br>I'll spare you the details of returning to Loch Modan (I died once, we fought the Loch Ness Monster, etc.), but I do want to share the rewards.  Twenty silver pieces for the Mercenaries quest, and for Chok'sul: <a target=“_blank” href=http://www.thottbot.com/?i=2525>Minor Channeling Ring</a> and <a target=“_blank” href=http://www.thottbot.com/?i=2535>Kimbra Boots</a>, as well as a new level for me, <a target=“_blank” href=http://wow.allakhazam.com/profile.html?2433>SlimWit</a>.</p>

    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The first weekend of the World of Warcraft is complete.  Blizzard has begun to settle down the servers and the game is looking sufficiently stable.  With the long weekend, many of us spent a lot of time in-game (probably too much).  I recall seeing four or five Old Geezers logged in at the same time.  We grouped for the first time and made some significant quest progress.  One night, Stumpmen (<a href="http://ogzr.org/forum/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_profile;u=00000159">aspalmat</a>), Banquor (<a href="http://ogzr.org/forum/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_profile;u=00000031">VRMan</a>), Valrain, and I got together for some Tunnel Rat stomping in Loch Modan.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/112804/surveyingthewaste.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/112804/surveyingthewaste.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>After that late night of gaming, Valrain and I met VRMan's alt (Xevi) to head to Westfall for some higher level adventuring.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/112804/waitingonthebridge.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/112804/waitingonthebridge.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>Stumpmen joined us and after questing for a bit, we headed to the beach for some surf and turf.  Unfortunately, no one told us that we were the turf part of the meal as we were clearly outmatched by monsters of a much higher level than most of us.  We persevered, recovered our corpses, and retreated to the city for the evening.<br><br>The weekend gaming for me wrapped up this afternoon with some great work with Stumpmen as uber-tank.  We completed a long quest for a stew recipe and then cleared out some bandits from a neighboring farm.  During that time, Stumpmen was able to work on his mining skill and, after I purchased the Guild Charter for 10sp, we had our first two guild members sign up.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/112804/ivebeenworkingontherailroad.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/112804/ivebeenworkingontherailroad.gif"></IMG></A><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/112804/guildstart.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/112804/guildstart.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>A good weekend for all...I think Valrain is leading the pack with a level 17 Hunter.  Exciting times ahead of us!</p>

    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I feel a little background is necessary before you read this.  I have successfully resisted massively-multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPG) since the beginning because I am completely cognizant of the fact that I am an inherently undisciplined and addictive person.  There is a reason they call it “EverCrack” I think.  That feeling, however, is in direct opposition of the cheap gaming b@st@rd in me that can’t pass up free multi-player gaming.  So, when a friend at work mentioned that I should try the Open Beta of World of Warcraft (WoW), I said “sure.”  Well, I liken the “Open Beta” to “high school heroin dealer” as they both put out free stuff to get you hooked and then you willingly pay later.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/111804/valandslim.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/111804/valandslim.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>I was finally able to hook up with <a HREF="http://ogzr.org/forum/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_profile;u=00000159">aspalmat</a> last night.  We’ve been talking a lot about the game but haven’t been able to meet-up in-person until last night.  My friend at work (Valrain) and I traversed to the Dark Elf island and met <a HREF="http://ogzr.org/forum/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_profile;u=00000159">aspalmat</a> before he logged off.  The time was about 11:30pm.  A “raid” was starting from the Dark Elf land planned to go into the Horde (the other player side in the game).  Valrain and I decided to join the raid to see how it went.<br><br>First step was to get from the Dark Elf island to the enemy.  We took hippogriffs to the next land and then boats to the land after that.  I recall that <a HREF="http://ogzr.org/forum/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_profile;u=00000159">aspalmat</a> mentioned in chat that the transportation is a lot quicker and more often in WoW than in the original EverQuest, FWIW.  After getting off the boat, here is where the raid goes a little squirrelly.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/111804/hippogrifftoauberdine.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/111804/hippogrifftoauberdine.gif"></IMG></A><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/111804/catchingboat.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/111804/catchingboat.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>Those of us that had been on the Eastern Kingdoms before were able to take an air taxi (Griffon) to the next rally point, which was Loch Modan.  Those that didn’t had to take the long and dangerous land route which just happened to skirt the enemy land.  At that fork in the road, a lot of the raid participants (40 in total) turned North to the Undead city instead of South to the rally point.  They got slaughtered as their numbers were small and they were relatively unsupported.  You see, there was only one priest out of the forty players in the raid...not a good thing.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/111804/griffontoloch.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/111804/griffontoloch.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>While we were cooling our heels in Loch Modan waiting for numbers, the enemy Horde had attacked in significant numbers on Kalimdor which is the western big island and the first stop mentioned above.  The raid purpose immediately went from offense to defense as we all land traversed back to the port town to hop on a boat and repel the assaulters of Auberdine.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/111804/traversebacktoboat.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/111804/traversebacktoboat.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>The boat landed and we immediately traversed to the South of town and succeeded in repelling the attacking Horde.  This was a massive PvP battle of Horde against Alliance.  I have never seen as many corpses in all my time in this game.  Unfortunately, our numbers were down to about 30 with others following.  The raid then turned to offense as we made a loooong land traverse South to end up in The Barrens.  Along the way engage some of the Horde remnants, but encountered a huge resistance in The Barrens at the Crossroads, where I quickly died to a huge monster.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/111804/highwatermark.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/111804/highwatermark.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>The time was about 1:30am, so I decided to take my old and weary bones to bed.  I teleported via my hearthstone back to Loch Modan, took a griffon to the Dwarven city of Ironforge, and went to bed.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/111804/griffonenteringironforge.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/111804/griffonenteringironforge.gif"></IMG></A><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/111804/griffoninforge.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/111804/griffoninforge.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>Overall, the raid was good experience.  I learned a lot about the Horde vs. Alliance aspect of the game and enjoyed that.  I also learned a lot about how to conduct such a raid, but that diatribe would go on for a lot longer, and I've already tortured you enough.<br><br><a HREF="http://ogzr.org/forum/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_profile;u=00000159">aspalmat</a> and I (<a HREF="http://ogzr.org/forum/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_profile;u=00000014">SlimWit</a>) are planning to lead an Old Geezer guild in WoW.  There hasn’t been much existing Geezer interest (VRMan and rumored others) so we will likely be recruiting outside the existing roster.  If you are interested, please hit the <a HREF="http://ogzr.org/joinus.htm">Join Us</a> page and we’ll look you up in game.  As Blizzard has not yet announced the servers names yet, I can’t tell you where will be, but I will announce in <a HREF="http://ogzr.org/forum">The Forum</a> what we decide.</p>
