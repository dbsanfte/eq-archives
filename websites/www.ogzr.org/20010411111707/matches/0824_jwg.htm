        Tonight, we played clan <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jediwithguns.com/">[JwG]</a>.
        The map was de_prodigy. We came into tonight's match, wanting and
        needing a win, after a few disappointing weeks. The match started a few
        minutes late, waiting for a few of our players that had difficulty
        connecting. [JwG] was gracious in waiting.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Round 1</b><br>
        On Walker Wars. We were T's. The whole round stayed close, staying
        within one or two of each other. Came down to the last round, with us
        trying to plant the bomb, and time running out before the timer did. It
        showed with the final score 10 - 9 [JwG].<br>
        <br>
        <b>Round 2</b><br>
        On their server now as CT's. The fighting was fierce, with them wanting
        to hold their lead from the first match, and us needing to win by 2.
        They split up and hit us from both sides, ever vigilant with their
        grenades. The score stayed close like the first round, until the last
        eight minutes, when they decided to hang back a little, forcing us to
        rush. Final score: 12 -7 [JwG].<br>
        <br>
        Overall Score: 22 - 16 [JwG]<br>
        <br>
        It was a very close match, and very enjoyable. Good game to all the guys
        in [JwG], and all the Geezers. Coder, thanks for Walker Wars: it ran
        good tonight. Despite the confusion and personnel trouble we had
        pre-match, and not having Roger Wilco running, we did very good. The CS
        team is coming together more and more each week, and I think it shows in
        the scores.
