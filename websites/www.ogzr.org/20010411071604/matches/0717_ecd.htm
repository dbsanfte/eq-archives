        Our TFC team did a great job playing <a href="http://www.clanecd.com" target="_blank">|ecD|</a> in their first STA match. Though we didn't win, the Geezers put up a valiant effort on Monday night. We won the first round at 98:90. The second round proved to be more difficult for both teams involved and much higher scoring, with a final combined score of
        308:290. |ecD| were a bunch of great guys to play with. They were good-natured oponents who even stopped by the mIRC room afterwards to compliment OGzr on a game well played. Who knows, we may see these guys in a scrim again someday soon.<br>
        <br>
        Keep up the good work TFC team! That was an incredibly close game. We were only a few caps away from a victory. Patience little grasshopper. For soon you shall be the master.</td>
