        <b>Round 1</b>: [OGzr] 70 -- [WW] 10<br>
        Round 1 got started a bit late, but not a big deal. We got warmed up a
        bit while we waited, so it worked out good. When the gates opened, it
        was a mad dash for both teams to get to the bridge and their perspective
        positions to get set first. The <a href="http://weedwarriors.clanpages.com/" target="_blank">[WW]</a>
        guys got to the bridge first, and before we could get our defense in
        positions and set, they grabbed our flag and made a mad dash for home.
        They got the early cap they were looking for and started again. By that
        time our Defense was ready and waiting for them. Our offense started
        making steady progress with their flag, by this time, and the spam on
        the bridge was in full swing. Our offense started making successful runs
        for the flag, getting several caps in a short period of time. Toward the
        end the [WW] guys were getting closer and closer to capping, moving the
        flag several times, but had to carry the flag through the base giving
        our defense a chance to close in and stop them. Through it all both
        sides were going all at it. The [WW] guys did great being one player
        short. I think it would have been a whole different match if they would
        have been fully staffed. They are a group of highly skilled, especially
        their soldiers, and classy group to play against.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Round 2</b>: [OGzr] 150 -- [WW] 10<br>
        Tonight's second round pre-match started up with the usual stress
        relieving game &quot;Spam Your Respawn&quot;. Similar to the
        fantastically popular game &quot;Mine Sweeper&quot;, there was carnage
        everywhere! Oh the humanity!! Then the match started with a ROAR! The
        Geezers headed across the bridge with guns blazing! Unfortunately, [WW]
        was well on their way to the Geezer flag already. They got the quick and
        fast cap but then the Geezer defense set up shop, but they weren't
        selling entrance tickets. The Geezer Offense set about penetrating the
        [WW] defenses. The [WW] soldiers were whupin' on the Geezers as they
        tried to get thru, but the Geezer Offense managed to snake by a few
        times.<br>
        <br>
        Kudos to the [WW] team members who stuck it out thru the whole match to
        the end. Great match all around. We look forward to our next encounter.<br>
        <br>
        Also, thanks (again) to Sieveman for loaning us the fantastic TPF
        Rymatics server. We love you, Sieve, and Coder will have your baby if
        you desire!
