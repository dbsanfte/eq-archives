        We've been looking forward to playing our fellow old farts in <a href="http://www.clancrack.net/" target="_blank">[CRACK]</a>
        for a while as there reputation preceded them as a great opponent. The
        were exactly that from our perspective.<br>
        <br>
        Round 1 was on the excellent [CRACK] server. The PM TK-ing ended, and we
        were able to get the switch down quickly and the flag out, but the
        [CRACK] defense stuck the flag for a return. Meanwhile, our defense was
        keeping the flag safely home, with many returned flags. The Old Geezers
        offense was working as we pulled out two caps, and then three quick
        ones, while the [CRACK] offense was pulling out a few. Round 1 was
        70-20, [OGzr].<br>
        <br>
        They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks--not so. During the
        break, the [CRACK] defense obviously had a chat because they adjusted
        greatly to our attack. Although we were able to get the switch down
        occassionally, the great [CRACK] defense was able to keep the flag in
        the FR. Meanwhile, the [CRACK] offense was able to move our flag a
        little and sneak three caps out, but our defense made them pay by
        flinging empty pill bottles and O2 bottles. A few return flags on our
        end, while our offense was snookered by the [CRACK] defense--Round 2
        score was 0-30, [CRACK]<br>
        <br>
        Final score: [OGzr] 70 -- [CRACK] 50. GG [CRACK]. You were great
        opponents. Look forward to playing again.
