        This is the second time the Old Geezers have faced off against the <a href="http://run.to/ad" target="_blank"> Attack Doggs</a> in the past three weeks, and we were looking forward to seeing them again. They're classy, fun guys. They beat us last time on Canalzone, and we hoped to exact a bit of revenge on 2Fort. Alas, 'twas not to be.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Round 1</b><br>
        Attack Doggs server, pings pretty even, favoring A-D about 128-107. Out of the gates, A-D scouts came flying over our battlements as the Geezers did the same. However, the A-D rush was successful with a few quick caps, while the Geezers managed a touch early, but couldn't get it out of the basement. This trend continued. A-D went heavy on D, or at least it seems that way because everywhere we looked we found soldiers and demos waiting. A-D brought home a few more caps, and our Offense couldn't crack their D. We managed I think 3 touches, but no scores. Our D was scrambling, but those Doggs were just too quick. Final, 50-0.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Round 2</b><br>
        Old Geezers Walker Wars, again pings even, favoring A-D about 102-72. The Geezers spent some time in IRC getting our heads together, and shuffled the O and D lineups a bit. Still had to wait a few minutes for our subs to appear, so thanks for your patience. Scout rush again, and again A-D brings it home quickly. Geeers not so lucky, because A-D locked down even more on D than the first round. [OGzr]VRMan managed to grab their flag and get into the open. A-D pounced on it, but eventually [OGzr]JackhOle was able to bring it home. A-D grabbed another flag, then pretty much went all D, and had a sniper and Demo holding the bridge. OGzr kept pushing, but could not break through their many defenders. Final, 20-10.<br>

        GG Attack Doggs. Nice deadeye soldiers.</td>
