        After a lot of grief for both teams on our Walker Wars server, we
        commandeered TPF Rymatics server for our match. Thank you Sieveman and
        12PackAttack.<br>

        Round 1 [OGzr] over <a href="http://www.planetiodine.com" target="_blank">[IOD]</a>
        / 120-10<br>
        Round 1 started out fast. Both teams setting up multiple sentries on
        defense. Both team had heavy offense attacking and clearing the enemy D.
        Old Geezers were able to hold their defense a bit longer each sortie. [IOD]
        kept the heat on and most of the time the only thing that stopped them
        from capping was our capping.<br>
        <br>
        Round 2 [OGzr] over [IOD] / 150-20<br>
        [IOD] had to loose a player for unknown reasons. We agreed to drop a
        player as well. Making the match 7vs7. [IOD] was hot off the starting
        blocks and capped first. They had good timing and kept the pressure on
        at our APC. Again, the only thing that ended up stopping them was our
        ability to cap. Many times they were at the cap point as we capped. Both
        teams changed their strategies from the first round. Making use of the
        lack of a full house. [IOD] did drop an additional player as did we. We
        had a sub jump back in, but they did not.<br>
        <br>
        The Golden Walker goes to [OGzr]Tusk for his great soldiery on defense.
        He held fast and never let our cap point be over run. Great job!<br>
        <br>
        Final score: [OGzr] 270 / [IOD] 30<br>
        <br>
        Great games guys! Fun was had by all!</td>
