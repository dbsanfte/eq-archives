    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The Old Guard made its first all-Geezer foray into the Scarlet Monestary, a World of Warcraft instance found deep in Tirisfal Glades.  There was not much planning beforehand but it proved to be great fun nonetheless.  The party was Valrain (lvl 45 Hunter), Eownmacmedb (lvl 45 Druid), SlimWit (lvl 45 Priest) Edeilirra (lvl 42 Warrior), and Chovak (lvl 38 Rogue).  This was a group adventuring together in a significant scenario for the first time in this fivesome. The evening began with the necessary and long crossing of the Western territory, deep into Horde-controlled land. <br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/031205/overlandcrossing.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/031205/overlandcrossing.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br><br>Scarlet Monestary is a group of four instances in which we had quests for three.  We started with the easiest of the three and steadily moved through the dungeons.  As you would expect, there were numerous books to read in the Monestary; some so interesting that you sometimes forgot what you were doing and why you were there...then again, maybe that was only my problem.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/031205/agoodbook.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/031205/agoodbook.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br><br>We tried a variety of attacking strategies and found that Chovak's sneaky ways really allowed us to control the opening of each battle when we hit the groups of two or more.  There were a couple of moments where this did not work, however.  On at least one occassion, dispatching a key enemy caused a swarm of enemy to respond, overwhelming us to a humorous point at least once.  Fortunately, Valrain was patient enough for the rest of us to return as she survived this swarming by feigning death.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/031205/overwhelmed.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/031205/overwhelmed.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br><br>The fact that it took three separate instances to complete the quests we had lead to a late night we old people, especially because each instance respawned many of the monsters.  We had to fight our way in and out in two cases.  In the end, The Old Guard was successful: we completed our quests and had fun doing it, not to mention the fact we learned quite a bit.  Valrain gained level 46 and the loot was decent.  After defeating the final enemy (one of them twice as he was resurrected), we gathered for a group picture and rode hearthstones home.  Thanks to all who participated!<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/031205/groupshot.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/031205/groupshot.gif"></IMG></A><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/031205/stoningout.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/031205/stoningout.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER></p>

We did hold on, however, with Kikash surviving enough to resurrect SlimWit, and then both of them returning the party to their corpses.  It had been a while since we took a beating like this, so we dusted ourselves off and proceeded deeper into the cave.<br><br>We did very well and entered a very large room where Kikash placed a staff into a small statue, which caused the staff to generate a bright beam of light, destroying a large, sealed door and freeing a massive monster that was a higher level than any of us had ever fought.  It was a long battle, with Eownmacmedb bravely throwing himself in front of the monstrosity, followed by Valrain, and then SlimWit, before Kutlachs and Kikash, both very low on life, were able to take Ironaya down.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/021205/spawnbig.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/021205/spawnbig.gif"></IMG></A><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/021205/deadbig.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/021205/deadbig.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>After reforming the party, we press deeper still, and encountered some huge battles against incredible numbers.

Uldaman is an instance that respawns, so we returned in, but it was clear to us that The Old Guard would not take the instance.  Returning through the portal, we hunted some of the missing quest items and turned in three quests for a lot of experience and some decent rewards, but wondering when we would return to this extremely fun instance.</p>

    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The Old Guard has been very active in recent weeks, but last night a few of us met to take on some new "instance" content on the Western shores of Kalimdor in the Blackfathom Deeps.  After putting a call out to Kutlachs (lvl 33 Warrior) and him dying a few times on the cross-ocean feature ("a feature"), Valrain (lvl 38 Hunter), Eownmacmedb (lvl 29 Druid), and SlimWit (lvl 38 Priest) picked up a non-Guild but equally worthy party member in Ruta (lvl 30 Druid) and ventured into the Deeps.  Both Ruta and Eownmacmedb had been here before and were our seasoned guides, but neither had seen it to the end of the instance.<br><br>Like other instances, the path to the portal was harried but we eventually made it through.  Our progress was steady through the instance with a lot of underwater battling.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/011705/seawitch.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/011705/seawitch.gif"></IMG></A><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/011705/moreunderwater.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/011705/moreunderwater.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>Unfortunately, Ruta has some serious connection issues and was dropped  and didn't reconnect until we were almost done.  Eownmacmedb also had a connection, but was able to rejoin us and remain connected to completion.<br><br>I must say that the dungeon was very impressive and worth the time investment.  We fought underwater and on the surface; casters and melee enemies; humanoid and summoned pets; all with one thing in common: triple the life as everything was "elite."  We have one particular battle towards the end where the enemies kept coming and coming that was extremely fun.  Then, soon after, we got a little cocky and did not heed our guide's advice of "don't touch the candles and stay away from the middle."  Well, it seems that translated in our heads as "hey, this is interactive...I wonder what happens when I click it?"  Instead of taking 20 or so enemies in 1/4 at a time, they all rushed us and we all paid for our lack of respect.  No worries, though, as this instance is not a re-spawning one: we returned to our corpses, resurrected, were rejoined by Ruta, and proceeded through again, taking a turn or two that we missed before to close a quest for Kutlachs.  Into the room where we died with a little more caution rewarded us with victory and access to the final boss, which Kutlachs pulled brilliantly and we made short work of.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/011705/finalbattle.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/011705/finalbattle.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>While the adventure may not have gained us many experience points, it was great content, the drops were fine, the cash was decent, and the quest rewards were excellent.

We modified our pulling strategy during the quest because once Valrain hit a monster, it wanted only to taste Valrain's blood and we preferred to keep our enemy in front of us more consistently.  Eventually, we did encounter VanCleef and his hirelings and defeated him after putting up with his overly confident boastings...dirt nap for VanCleef and good loot for us all.</p>

Our shining moment was a much harried battle against at least six gnolls, each our level or higher.  Everyone in the group was patient and didn't panic, and our only loss was the valiant pet Thathos.  We mourned his loss and healed in order to continue the fight.  In the end, the only death our party suffered was due to a server crash or disconnection for all and I was able to gain a level (Priest 23).  Here we are returning to camp after completing the quest.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120904/returningfrombattle.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120904/returningfrombattle.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>After cleaning up and reconciling our accounts with Lakeshire's shopkeepers, we moved just out of town to help a local inhabitant rid her garden from an unwelcome guest: Bellygrub, a huge boar.  The experience gained from this encounter was enough for Kutlachs to level (now Warrior 22). <br><br>We did very well tonight and I think our proudest moment was not panicking against larger numbers and being patient enough to keep everyone alive and kicking.</p>

    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">We put together a pretty strong group last night with Valrain (21 Hunter), Kutlachs (20 Warrior), Kikash (16 Paladin), and myself (22 Priest) to take on a couple of elite quests in Loch Modan that I wrote about <a href="#newsitem1101996285,47097,">earlier</a>.  The plan was to head out to complete the first quest and level Kikash to 17 so he could get credit for completing the Chok'sul quest.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/ogreparty.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/ogreparty.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>That strategy went well as we easily completed the first elite quest and Kikash hit the requisite level 17 for the next quest.  Additionally, we were joined by Edeilirra.  We entered the cave to battle the mighty Chok'sul.  The adventure here is best summarized by "Just like a Geezer to bring a knife to a gunfight."  <br><br>We assisted another party in their quest by handling the additional monsters besides Chok'sul before we got our chance.  We waited for Chok'sul to respawn, and waited, and waited, and waited.  Finally, he spawns with his two friends, but unbeknownst to us, two more behind us spawned.  We weren't able to handle the encounter and ended up wiping and all running on water to retrieve our corpses.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/wiped.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/wiped.gif"></IMG></A><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/runningonwater.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/runningonwater.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>So, we regrouped and tried again, and again, and again, and again.  I think we wiped at least five times.  Also, Blizzard dropped Kutlachs with their random patching mechanism and we wiped then, too.  Finally, with our equipment close to breaking, we engage a higher level party to provide covering fire for us to handle the adds.  Well, that stroke of genius proved to be very timely, as we made short order of Chok'sul and returned to town to lick our wounds.  The quest rewards were excellent and we absolutely learned a ton.<br><br>I was in need of visiting the Elf city of Darnassus to train with their Artisan Alchemist. Valrain and I took the boat to Darkshore, flew from Darkshore to Teldrassil, and ran to the Elven capital.  To cap the night off, we fished a bit before retiring.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/flyingtodarnassus.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/flyingtodarnassus.gif"></IMG></A><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/fishingwithfriends.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/fishingwithfriends.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER></p>

    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I stumbled onto an unbelievable gaming session this morning.  As some of you know, I awake at 5am to get a couple of hours of grinding and other administrative stuff done.  I don't expect much out of this time; I was <B>very</B> wrong about that this morning...this morning was on of the best times I've had in-game, yet.  It's always a pleasant surprise to group with people you don't know and actually have a fun time.  World of Warcraft is a great game and my gaming in the early hours connects me with fellow serious and mature players.<br><br>I was headed out to the East side of Loch Modan to pick up a few quests.  As I was waiting for the NPC to show up, I partied with a level 15 Dwarf Paladin so we could do the quest at the same time and not have to wait further.  We escorted the NPC to <a target=“_blank” href=http://i1.thottbot.com/Interface/WorldMap/LochModan/LochModanbig.jpg>Ironbad's Excavation Site</a> and I picked up a quest that the Paladin said he had difficulty with earlier.<br><br>We ventured into the excavation site and started knocking off some mobs, and were joined by a level 18 Night Elf Warrior.  He helped tremendously in pulling and holding aggro.  We completed that quest for all three of us, feeling rather flush with our success, I must admit.<br><br>The Dark Elf asked if we wanted to try the two Elite quests in Loch Modan and we agreed after the ease of completing the former quest.  Along the way we found a Gnome Mage and asked if he wanted to join us.  He inspected us and surmised that we'd need a lot more horsepower to survive and departed.  No hard feelings on our part, but we decided to focus on the lower of the two quests based on his feedback: <a target=“_blank” href=http://www.thottbot.com/?q=666>Mercenaries</a>.<br><br>We approached the ogre camp with some trepidation based on the Gnome's wisdom, and inched slowly against the ogres.  The Warrior pulled one and I quickly went through my mana as we defeated it.  Being out of mana as a Priest is not a good thing for the party, so I began to scale back my damage spells a bit.  We made nice progress against the quest but only because we were engaging one or two at a time.<br><br>Along came a level 23 Dark Elf Hunter and we invited him to join us.  That addition to the party really turned the tide against the ogres and we made quick work of the quest, pushed into the cave, and made the decision to go for Loch Modan's other known Elite quest: <a target=“_blank” href=http://www.thottbot.com/?q=661>WANTED: Chok'sul Alliance</a><br><br>The pace was pretty frenetic.  So much so that I don't have the normal screenshots to share with you unfortunately.  We engaged more ogres in the cave (level 19 or 20) and made it to Chok'sul's chamber, where 2 casting ogres and Chok'sul were waiting.  The fight was a long one, and I was largely in the role of healer as I should have been.  The Priest's Power Word: Shield was invaluable to our survival.  After eliminating his companions, we focused on Chok'sul and defeated him with tanks at 50% health and a dead pet for the Hunter who was a true hero in the engagement.<br><br>I'll spare you the details of returning to Loch Modan (I died once, we fought the Loch Ness Monster, etc.), but I do want to share the rewards.  Twenty silver pieces for the Mercenaries quest, and for Chok'sul: <a target=“_blank” href=http://www.thottbot.com/?i=2525>Minor Channeling Ring</a> and <a target=“_blank” href=http://www.thottbot.com/?i=2535>Kimbra Boots</a>, as well as a new level for me, <a target=“_blank” href=http://wow.allakhazam.com/profile.html?2433>SlimWit</a>.</p>

Blizzard has begun to settle down the servers and the game is looking sufficiently stable.  With the long weekend, many of us spent a lot of time in-game (probably too much).  I recall seeing four or five Old Geezers logged in at the same time.  We grouped for the first time and made some significant quest progress.  One night, Stumpmen (<a href="http://ogzr.org/forum/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_profile;u=00000159">aspalmat</a>), Banquor (<a href="http://ogzr.org/forum/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_profile;u=00000031">VRMan</a>), Valrain, and I got together for some Tunnel Rat stomping in Loch Modan.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/112804/surveyingthewaste.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/112804/surveyingthewaste.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>After that late night of gaming, Valrain and I met VRMan's alt (Xevi) to head to Westfall for some higher level adventuring.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/112804/waitingonthebridge.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/112804/waitingonthebridge.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>Stumpmen joined us and after questing for a bit, we headed to the beach for some surf and turf.  Unfortunately, no one told us that we were the turf part of the meal as we were clearly outmatched by monsters of a much higher level than most of us.  We persevered, recovered our corpses, and retreated to the city for the evening.<br><br>The weekend gaming for me wrapped up this afternoon with some great work with Stumpmen as uber-tank.  We completed a long quest for a stew recipe and then cleared out some bandits from a neighboring farm.  During that time, Stumpmen was able to work on his mining skill and, after I purchased the Guild Charter for 10sp, we had our first two guild members sign up.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/112804/ivebeenworkingontherailroad.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/112804/ivebeenworkingontherailroad.gif"></IMG></A><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/112804/guildstart.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/112804/guildstart.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>A good weekend for all...I think Valrain is leading the pack with a level 17 Hunter.

I have successfully resisted massively-multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPG) since the beginning because I am completely cognizant of the fact that I am an inherently undisciplined and addictive person.  There is a reason they call it “EverCrack” I think.  That feeling, however, is in direct opposition of the cheap gaming b@st@rd in me that can’t pass up free multi-player gaming.  So, when a friend at work mentioned that I should try the Open Beta of World of Warcraft (WoW), I said “sure.”  Well, I liken the “Open Beta” to “high school heroin dealer” as they both put out free stuff to get you hooked and then you willingly pay later.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/111804/valandslim.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/111804/valandslim.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>I was finally able to hook up with <a HREF="http://ogzr.org/forum/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_profile;u=00000159">aspalmat</a> last night.  We’ve been talking a lot about the game but haven’t been able to meet-up in-person until last night.  My friend at work (Valrain) and I traversed to the Dark Elf island and met <a HREF="http://ogzr.org/forum/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_profile;u=00000159">aspalmat</a> before he logged off.

Valrain and I decided to join the raid to see how it went.<br><br>First step was to get from the Dark Elf island to the enemy.  We took hippogriffs to the next land and then boats to the land after that.  I recall that <a HREF="http://ogzr.org/forum/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_profile;u=00000159">aspalmat</a> mentioned in chat that the transportation is a lot quicker and more often in WoW than in the original EverQuest, FWIW.

Those that didn’t had to take the long and dangerous land route which just happened to skirt the enemy land.  At that fork in the road, a lot of the raid participants (40 in total) turned North to the Undead city instead of South to the rally point.  They got slaughtered as their numbers were small and they were relatively unsupported.  You see, there was only one priest out of the forty players in the raid...not a good thing.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/111804/griffontoloch.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/111804/griffontoloch.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>While we were cooling our heels in Loch Modan waiting for numbers, the enemy Horde had attacked in significant numbers on Kalimdor which is the western big island and the first stop mentioned above.

This was a massive PvP battle of Horde against Alliance.  I have never seen as many corpses in all my time in this game.  Unfortunately, our numbers were down to about 30 with others following.  The raid then turned to offense as we made a loooong land traverse South to end up in The Barrens.

I also learned a lot about how to conduct such a raid, but that diatribe would go on for a lot longer, and I've already tortured you enough.<br><br><a HREF="http://ogzr.org/forum/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_profile;u=00000159">aspalmat</a> and I (<a HREF="http://ogzr.org/forum/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_profile;u=00000014">SlimWit</a>) are planning to lead an Old Geezer guild in WoW.  There hasn’t been much existing Geezer interest (VRMan and rumored others) so we will likely be recruiting outside the existing roster.  If you are interested, please hit the <a HREF="http://ogzr.org/joinus.htm">Join Us</a> page and we’ll look you up in game.  As Blizzard has not yet announced the servers names yet, I can’t tell you where will be, but I will announce in <a HREF="http://ogzr.org/forum">The Forum</a> what we decide.</p>
