Army of Shadows* and [30+] joined [OGzr] on our home server, and were singing the Walker Wars praises after experiencing a lightning quick lag test that confirmed the superiority of our venue.<br><br>JR got things started for [OGzr], drawing first blood and killing another on Wilderness.  Tracker6 added a grenade kill, but AoS* outlasted everyone and took the opening map.  [OGzr] stormed back on one of their favorites, Swamp Airfield, and expertly closed down the center airstrip to take a convincing win.  Cint scored 3 kills, while Stat and JR added two more.  The Geezers closed in a perimeter with a good defensive triangle to win the map.<br><br>[OGzr] would only win one other map out of a total of 17 this night, but played several memorable scenarios with their worthy opponents.  On Farm Day, Stat secured a draw by killing along the southern field.  LtSam went on a fairly long expedition only to be gunned down by an expecting enemy...but JR followed behind to avenge his death.  POW Camp was a disappointing loss, and a virtual grenade-fest.  [OGzr] scored their second win on another favorite, Docks, where LtSam again went hunting, and this time bagged three enemy.  JR and Cint also added kills to demonstrate to AoS* and [30+] why it's a bad idea to hang out at night on a secluded pier.<br><br>After 3 1/2 hours of play...AoS* won their fifth map to take the Golden Turkey trophy home.  It was a great night, and all teams demonstrated good spirit and mature gamesmanship.

[OGzr] bolted out of the starting gate on Village, where LtSam scored early gun and grenade kills, and was slain as he capped his third enemy.  Stat added a kill, and JR was talked-onto-target to kill the remaining enemy with an expertly thrown grenade.  LtSam came right back on Castle, killing 3 enemy again.  Tracker6 avenged JR's death, and Cint scored the final grenade kill of the map.  Next up...Beach.  Spawning on high ground, JR and Tracker6 teamed up with 1 kill each on the near-spawn corridor, while Stat and Vaulden blocked up the far corridor, each with a kill.  JR finished the map by killing the sole remaining bad guy.<br><br>After an extended "intermission" where *RWG* could catch their breath, [OGzr] returned to lose the next 4 maps straight.  Aurora and Ghost Town were disappointing losses...possibly a symptom of being over-confident on maps that [OGzr] feels comfortable with.  After adding a sixth player to each side, *RWG* took Market and Night Castle before Old Geezers regrouped on Battlefield.  Vaulden and Stat aggressively hunted the enemy and killed 2 each.  LtSam iced another enemy to leave the remaining *RWG* player alone and outnumbered.  As [OGzr] reduced their perimeter, the bad guy exposed himself by firing at LtSam, and Tracker6 zoomed in on an easy target.<br><br>Tied at 4-4...the teams spawned on the expected rubber match, Mountain.  [OGzr] went down quickly, and with time running out, it looked like *RWG* would maintain a 1 player advantage.  Alas, LtSam scored a well-placed shot to force the match to another map.  On River, the map progressed similarly, with [OGzr] suffering a 1 man deficit...until JR tossed an amazing grenade long-distance with 2 minutes left to force another map.  Unfortunately, even though [OGzr] took the lead early on Roadblock, *RWG* showed true perseverance and edged out a win.<br><br>The match was one of the most spirited in recent [OGzr] history...we tip our caps to *RWG*, a well-disciplined and fun opponent.

The Old Geezers succeeded at accomplishing this objective...but walked away empty-handed (yet again) as their rest-home compadres scored another win.<br><br>There was no slow start tonight, as the teams spawned a stone's throw away from each other on Riverbed.  JR saw three separate enemy within his field of view, but was gunned down before he could switch off his weapon's safety.  Trakcer6 scored a lucky grenade kill while the enemy loitered at their spawn point, but was then quickly silenced.  Later, Statilius managed to ice a bad guy, but it was not enough as even he was hunted down. [OGzr] showed signs of life on the following night map, Airbase, and scored a win by taking down all of [30+] without suffering a single casualty.  JR took aim out of a high window to score two kills, and LtSam also notched 2 kills from his sniper rifle.<br><br>With the score tied at 1-1, Old Geezers appeared poised to take another win on Prison, but a last-minute rush by [30+] forced a draw.  The enemy demonstrated excellent patience on Plantation, even in the face of Stat and JR scoring consecutive kills by working around the far road.  [OGzr] turned out another draw on Roadblock.  Stat scored an early kill on the road, and LtSam followed with a long-range sniper round.  Tracker6 bottled up the northern gap with 1 gun kill and another grenade kill.  Unfortunately, The Geezers ran out of steam, and suffered 3 map loses in a row on Bridges, River and Red Square (even with Cintilious' gun and grenade kill on Red Square, it seems like this communist map is the curse of [OGzr]).<br><br>Matching with [30+] continues to be fun and rewarding...but it appears after consecutive loses, it's time for The Geezers to adjust tactics.

It started out friendly enough, with the Old Geezers hosting again on Walker Wars (this time a 4v4 match), and battling to a draw on the first map, Castle.  Tracker6 drew first blood, but was killed by the late-*CoRe* player as he got off a lucky round.  Stat rallied to avenge both T6 and Cint's deaths.  [OGzr] spawned low on Beach, and suffered a loss as the enemy skillfully maintained the high ground.  Tracker6 killed two bad guys on Night Farm, but it wasn't enough as [OGzr] suffered their second map loss of the night.<br><br>[OGzr] suffered their third map loss of the night on Hunting Lodge, despite expert marksmanship from Cint.  After avenging T6 and Stat's deaths, he scored his third kill on the map...but was unfortunately slain by a stray bullet, narrowly missing a draw.  [OGzr] took an extended pee-break before the next map, Night Battle, and it paid off.  Stat quickly killed two *CoRe* players trying to flank his position...JR added a third kill.  With only 1 enemy left, Stat moved into commanding terrain, and was able to maintain cover while the lone *CoRe* player stalked the remaining Geezers.  Stat added the final kill of the map, bringing [OGzr] their first map win of the night.<br><br>On Day Farm, it appeared as if the Geezers would maintain momentum.  JR silenced 2 enemy, but a rogue sniper hugged the ground, killing T6, LtSam and JR, before Cint was left to fend for himself.  Before Mountain Stronghold, *CoRe* StoneCold joined to make the final 2 maps of the night 5v5.  This turned out to be a bad omen for [OGzr]...for even though Stat killed 2 enemy on the map, StoneCold unleashed his fury, killing 4 [OGzr] and pulling a draw out of thin air.  On the final map of the night, Prison, the Geezers ran out of breath...<br><br>[OGzr] looks forward to another meeting with *CoRe*, always a classy bunch.

However, after a brief rest and opportunity to adjust their battle-sights,  [OGzr] showed true resiliency on the very next match, coming back to win on one of our favorites, Ghost Town.  Tracker6 was steered onto enemy targets around the house, and was able to run down 3 bad guys before he took a round in the back running to linkup with his teammate.  sfpops was the remaining Geezer, and expertly adjusted OICW rounds onto the remaining *CoRe* player.<br><br>[OGzr] took a draw on the next map, Airfield, after LtSam and Cint investigated center map and scarred the enemy into the open terrain.  sfpops covered JR up top and allowed him to knock off 2 enemy, while Tracker6 killed 2 bad guys at the bottom of the map.  Unfortunately, this was the last gasp for the Geezers; *CoRe* took out their superior night-vision goggles to blank [OGzr] on Aurora, and then showed up on Beach...where at least LtSam killed one enemy as he crossed the wall...while Cint tried to fool everyone by standing straight up and playing rabbit!  Market was a disappointing wipeout to end the night.<br><br>*CoRe* is a very talented team that moves quickly and shoots accurately.

The match set several records for The Old Geezer Ghost Recon squad, including:<br><br>Longest Match: 3 hrs. 40 minutes<br>Most Maps: 16<br>Most Draws: 8<br><br>After the first four maps, [OGzr] led 2-1, and felt confident that their stamina would carry them through to ultimate victory.  Winning first on Docks, the Geezers suffered an early sniper kill, but 30+ spawned on the western dock and decided to stay put, sealing their fate.  Tracker6 succeed in killing 3 enemy as they loitered behind their cover, and the rest of the Geezers closed in to prevent [30+] from breaking out.  [30+] turned around on then next map, Market, and beat the Geezers in a final 1-on-1 duel with sfpops.  JR returned on map 3, Beaches, to help secure the second OGzr victory of the night.  The map appeared to be heading for a draw, but JR notched his second map kill with only 5 seconds left to assure victory.<br><br>The Geezers accounted for their third win on map 7, Beach Resort.  JR, Cint and LtSam all scored 2 kills each to exterminate [30+].  The map required a tremendous amount of movement, as the Geezers spawned in the SW, and moved clockwise all the way to the top of the map, clearing enemy out of the resort, and icing the remaining [30+] players while they were wading in the water.  In true [30+] style, they returned to win the next map, Train Depot, by blanking OGzr without a single kill.  [OGzr] managed to stabilize themselves next on Red Square by pulling a draw after getting bunched up in a difficult spawn point.  Stat was the lone Geezer to break out, and scored two kills by working his way along the opposite side of the map.  [30+] tied the match score at 3-3 later when they won on Village...even after sfpops got his first kill of the night!<br><br>The Geezers couldn't manage to regain their strength, and suffered several more draws and 2 losses on Battlefield and RRBridge to lose the match.  More likely...the geritol bottles ran low, and with the wives already in bed, no one was available to provide a quick resupply.  Though retiring in defeat, the Geezers played well together, and thoroughly enjoyed matching another classy, mature GR clan.  We look forward to matching again, [30+]...and this time, we'll start at noon!<br><br><b>Final Score:  [OGzr]</b>...3  <b>[30+]</b>...5<br></p>

The tables turned during the first night map of the match, as JR and the rest of [OGzr] cleaned-up on Airbase.  Again, Cint and Cart combined for 1 kill each while hugging elevated ground...while JR maneuvered into a hangar and proceeded to exterminate the remaining enemy.<br><br>Hitting his stride, JR returned on the next map, Train Wreck, and came close to wrecking ]RS[ single-handedly.  For the second map in a row, he killed 4 enemy...on both sides of the track, but somehow it wasn't enough.  On Military Camp, ]RS[ scored 3 quick kills and successfully maintained momentum throughout the match, even in light of sfpops's stellar grenade kill and Cint's rifle kill.<br><br>[OGzr] had moderate success on the second night map of the evening, pulling a draw on Beach, as Cint and T6 bottled up the western low ground, while LtSam, JR and sfpops moved in aggressively to the high ground and cleared the buildings in the east.  On the last two maps of the evening, [OGzr] showed some promise, with noteworthy rifle success as Cint and LtSam both killed 2 enemy on the beach, and lethal sniper accuracy from Cart.

While its website declares that =CGi= is "committed to the common sense of fair play"...it didn't seem fair that [OGzr] got stomped almost as ruthlessly as they did in the first match of the night (see news post below)!

But then, LtSam and Tracker6 went down in short order, leaving SlimWit and sfpops unprotected and vulnerable to the enemy as they streamed through the airfield.  Cint was the sole survivor, and was a victim of inferior terrain as he crossed the stream only to meet an enemy peering down at him from up high on the opposite bank.<br><br>The Geezers' shining moment came on '<i>Beach</i>'. Spawning on the low ground, Cint and SlimWit proceeded to lock-down the west corridor, while LtSam and sfpops moved into position near the east corridor.  Cint scored the opening 2 kills, but the western beach defenders were eventually silenced by a sniper.  LtSam had great success on the east corridor, also scoring 2 kills.  The remaining enemy sniper, in true heroic fashion, sprinted from the west, into the surf, and reemerged face to face with LtSam.  LtSam was quicker on the trigger, and the Geezers (after losing 8 consecutive maps on the night) finally triumphed.<br><br>Unfortunately, the last 2 maps of the night were similar to the pace of the first 2.  On '<i>Airbase</i>', an [OGzr] favorite, the Geezers were pinned down in their spawn corner, and subjected to overwhelming enemy sniper fire and quick maneuver.

    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It was "old timers" versus "older timers" tonight, as the [OGzr] men in wheelchairs met-up with 7 rest home residents from clan The Final Option [TFO]. Not only was this the first ever 7v7 match for the Old Geezer GR Squad...it was the first time we played against not 1, but 2 players who are actually older than our own beloved sfpops!<br><br>After welcoming [OGzr]Thar T'Pak to his first team match, the Geezers checked their "bins" and launched into 'River'.  [TFO] flooded the top of the map and rained down OICW shells until [OGzr]sfpops was last man standing.  He successfully took down 1 enemy, but was quickly silenced.  The Geezers fared much better with 'Red Square', where both teams spawned directly across from each other and fought back and forth from impenetrable cover.  Stat cleaned up a couple bad guys to start the round, and LtSam expertly maneuvered around the flank to reduce the map to only 2 enemy.  Still, the Geezers couldn't hold them off, and [TFO] advanced, score 2-0.<br><br>The Geezers caught fire on the next two maps.  Recovering from an early tragic team kill, [OGzr]Tracker6 and [OGzr]sfpops finished 'Ravine' with a draw by working in tandem to kill 2 enemy each.  [TFO] met their match on Map#4, 'Farm Day'.  Cint made quick contact on the bottom of the map, and JR made contact up top.  The remaining [TFO] players insisted on running across the open field...and right into Tracker6's sights, who left 4 enemy bleeding to death center map.  LtSam brought the 3 remaining Geezers in tight to wait out their hard-fought win.<br><br>Trailing only 2-1 going into Map#5, 'Valley' got the better of [OGzr].  Cint and Stat worked well together, as Cint scored a couple of kills with well tossed grenades.  In the end, Stat played cat-and-mouse with the remaining [TFO] player until the 2 met gun-muzzle to gun-muzzle.  The next map, 'High Sierra', may as well have been named 'Rape in the Sierras' as [TFO] swept the Geezers without losing a single man.  In the last map, 'Train Depot', Thar, LtSam and JR headed up the hill to a meeting engagement with several [TFO].  JR killed 1 with a grenade and 1 with a bullet, but the squad was flanked by two enemy, and met an untimely end.  The map was methodically reduced until 5 enemy chased the lone [OGzr] Stat.  Using the buildings and train cars to his advantage, the outnumbered Stat successfully murdered 2 enemy, but was eventually killed.<br><br>[TFO] demonstrated a very aggressive style of play and excellent mastery of the maps.  [OGzr] raises their canes to their fellow Depends-wearing opponents, and wheels off to bed.  Final Score: 5-1-1.</p>

On the third map, [30+] secured the high ground to clear the map.  The fourth map had the Geezers lose the middle and then had their flanking attempts thwarted but good [30+] covering fire.<br><br>The Geezers then took some good cover on the fifth map with interlocking fields of fire to reduce [30+] to one soldier.  SlimWit even had a kill, holding the friendly side of the bridge to the North.  The sixth map, however, was a great demonstration of patience by [30+] as they cleared [OGzr] in short order.<br><br>The Geezers finally found the replacement batteries for their hearing aids on the last two maps, with <a href="http://ogzr.org/forum/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_profile;u=00000302" target="_blank">JR</a> and Lt.Sam doing the heavy lifting.  On Embassy, [OGzr] took advantage of a bad spawn for [30+] and made short work in the garage from both directions with Cintillious on one end, JR and Lt.Sam clearing the embassy and then focusing on the other end of the garage.  On the final map of the night, the Geezers were able to get to good firing positions to reduce [30+] around the Military Camp, with Cintillious and JR each downing one and Lt.Sam taking two.<br><br>It was a professional and enjoyable match for the Old Geezers.  [30+], as always, distinguished themselves as great competitors!  <b>Geezers win</b>: [OGzr] 5 -- [30+] 3.</p>

The fifth map, Roadblock, started better with the Geezers quickly taking down two WDA soldiers, but WDA battled back to clear the map.<br><br>After finishing off the rest of our meds, the Old Geezers stormed back  on Castle, with <a href="http://ogzr.org/forum/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_profile;u=00000034" target="_blank">Tracker6</a> killing one then flushing the last WDA soldier to <a href="http://ogzr.org/forum/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_profile;u=00000014" target="_blank">SlimWit</a> to win the map.

Vaulden returned to the team for action and the geezers took 5 maps in a row.<br>The Geezer squad challenged the higher ranked Band of Brothers and showed no mercy. Playing in the new format of random maps and best 5 out of 9 the team won 5 in a row.Three maps had been won when out of the blue the team heard a blast from the past. Their old team mate Vaulden had returned to fight. Showing some rust he was killed in map 4 but the Skills of Statilious led the team to victory.Vauldens rust wasn't showing in map 5 as he got two kills. The map looked like it was going to be a lost yet for the courage of JR. He killed 2 players with the last being killed with less than 10 seconds in map. The team played well tonight and match was worth 2 points</p>

We also decided to check out the reavers since it was the only piece she was missing. We got a Jade reaver on the second kill of the first cycle. How awesome is that. Anyway, everyone give a big Grats to our first epic Druid. We also looted the second stone, not sure if it can be MQed but if it can we will be getting Emong's in the next couple days.</p>

Coming off of a very productive training camp with Clan FR last week, the Geezers immediately put into action its position strategy.  The squad went up 1, then went even; went up 1, then went back to even; and finally, went up for the third time of the round, and managed to win on time.

Indeed, Recon Battalion adapted well to the opening round, and ended up dominating the map.<br><br>The final two rounds played on Recon Battalion's choice of maps, Caves.  Round 4 was ugly; the Old Ones had poor spawn placement, and Recon Battalion showed their true mastery of sniping from what seemed like all directions (PaleRider scored the only kill).  The final round was much more even, but [OGzr] was no match for the enemy snipers.<br><br>The high quality of their Clan webpage (<a href="http://recon.rabidd.com">http://recon.rabidd.com</a> ) turned out to be quite indicative of the high quality of their Ghost Recon game play.  Recon Battalion is a professional team, we look forward to a future firefight soon.<br></p>

By Round #4, [OGzr] was truly warmed up...the squad locked down the map and [OGzr]s Viagra and Cint commanded a 2v1 advantage for most of the round.  Again, [OGzr]Viagra's patience paid off, as he scored the final cap to put *AP to rest.

Thankfully, the Geezers got their heart-pacer batteries recharged during the intermission.<br><br>Round 2:  Geezers score two kills during a much more even match.  Pale Rider stalked to the second floor of a corner building to score a sniping kill, and Tracker6 put his 7.62 carbine to work at long range while an enemy ditty-bopped down the street; but in the end, [JAG] came away with their second win.<br><br>Round 3:  Geezers choose Plantation as the next map...and it pays off.  sfpops scored a very solid 3 kills, and Pale Rider turned in another 2 to finish off [JAG].  Geezers worked a good checkerboard pattern to cover all avenues on the map, and used team communication well to identify enemy locations.<br><br>Round 4:  A heartbreaking tie, where a Geezer 2 v 1 advantage was lost with one second left in the round!!  Pale Rider and T6 went down quickly...then sfpops began to snipe like a king!  Unfortunately, he went out at the last second, leaving Cint as the lone Geezer.<br><br>Round 5:  Another well played and even match, with some [JAG] players claiming it to be the most nerve wracking match they'd ever played; they come out with a close win.<br><br>It was a good battle, we look forward to our next run-in with the classy folks from [JAG].<br></p>

With the guard dead the rest of the Ancients fell upon Bvellos like a pack of ravenous wolves. For the first time in thier rivaled past Bvellos knew fear.

At the entrance they were stalled, Chracner lay flat on his back daring not move for fear he would bring the wrath of the froglok nation down upon them. The battle raged around him as he lay there helpless to offer anything save advise. The only things standing in the way of total destruction and an end to the adventure were a young barbarian rogue named Miss and trust. Her trust that the others would not let her fall and their trust that she would not quit, not run, not fail in the task they had appointed her.....<br><br>Oh what battles they faught. Everyone had a place and knew what it was. Everyone faught like true heros.<br><br> These rare moments when you only have your faith to guide you, it is nice to have someone to put that faith in......Dremarian</p>

This night, the Plane of Disease would be explored even at the cost of our lives if need be. The brave souls at the beginning of the journey included Marloon, talented mage and master of the elements; Baron Saxmoore, the powerful wizard and leader of our small army; Baronness (?) Cristineiya, the druid, one with nature and bearer of formidable earthen magics; Halicia, faithful vicar and restorer of life; Sindaria, the beguiling Enchantress, able to fascinate and charm the worst of beasts long enough for us to vanquish their brethren; and myself, a humble Cavalier of Marr, ready to bear the brunt of whatever onslaught we might face in that blighted place.<br><br>After speaking to the keeper of the gateway to the outskirts of Bertoxx' plane to get clearance to enter, we all leapt into the gate itself, a huge foul-looking spigot, ever flowing with unnatural murky waters. We arrived in the graveyard of this dark humid place, surrounded by the corpses of other adventurers, a warning perhaps? This was a hideous place, sticky fetid humid, with an evil odor drifting from the rivers of waste that flow thru it. We made our way thru the huge hairs growing out of the ground, past several other brave souls, til we found a clearing near a nest of venomous spiders. I set off to bring one to us and its offspring, which I hadn't seen, came as well. To our shock these evil beasts tend to wield magics almost as powerful as our own, so our Enchantress had to weave her spell of fascination on one, keeping it enthralled as we destroyed the other. Marloon's elemental servant fought valiantly as I kept the attention of the huge arachnid. Halicia saved my life many times over, completely healing me as this vicious....thing, tore into my armored form. Cristineiya while summoning thorny vines to shield me and damage the beast, also managed to patch a wound that might have killed me seconds before Halicia's healing could take effect, thus once again saving the life of this humble knight. Finally, with a devastating blast from our wizard we vanquished the more powerful of the 2 and went to work destroying its foul offspring. This went on in similar fashion for a time, until a crafty pair of spiders finally got the better of me, as one held my attention as it's cunning sibling relentlessly attacked our beloved healer. It refused to be deterred even by Sindaria's considerable enchantments. I swore beneath my breath as I turned, much too late, to see faithful Halicia fall to its fangs. Vowing vengeance, I shouted to Baron Saxmoore to call upon his magics to whisk the others clear as I too fell to their attack, mercilessly struck down from behind by the original monster....<br><br>Later after Halicia called on her(his) powers to revive us, we ventured out again, unfortunately without the assistance of the mage Marloon, but we attracted the attention of an outrider of considerable experience who was exploring the area on his own, traveling under the name of Breowan. He assisted us in ridding the area of scores of its revolting inhabitants, including different varieties of tsetsian flies, larvae, and vile pox-ridden disease infested rats. He fell valiantly at one point in the battle as well but Halicia speedily returned him to the fight. All in all, I think we made our mark on this foul place, though it did seem to mock us as we left and more vile fiends appeared to replace those we laid waste to...<br><br>(as you can see, it's a slow day at work. long story short we went to PoD camped spiders, whacked em, me and Hali died once, then mar left and breowan was tryin to solo where we were pulling from. we took all spawns so he joined our group. He died once, then we killed stuff til we got sleepy and left......Jaimekash</p>

We then moved to island two and the home of Gwan, our target. <br><br>Everyone was in the wind mill which is the center piece for this tiny island, they were all buffed as planned, this is the last thing that went right for the team. <br><br>The plan was for Gymli to aggro Gwan and pull him into the wind mill where everyone else would kill him. Chrac did the hand in, said the magic words, and the fun began. Gymli got Gwan to the ramp then got blown backwards off the island and out of the zone. Dan took over as MA and we proceeded to hack him good. Then Dan gets summoned outside on a bad pathing deal and blown off the island. Now here is where things get realy crazy. Chracner and Graphyte start ping ponging Gwan back and forth until finally Chracner gets blown out of the mill and off the island. Now if you are keepin score, Chracner is the reason they went to this place, and now they have lost not 1 but 3 tanks from the main group. Now at this point most weaker souls would have packed their bags and took the leap off the side off the island, but not our team. Graphyte, who for the record is ten levels lower then Gwan, gave him a timely 650 point Harm touch to get its his attention, and group two, with the tattered remains of one took it to the hoop. <br><br>Now some would say that we are weak for having had it get that out of control. I say we did it our way and won. That was quite possibly 5 minutes of the most intense fighting I have seen in game to date, and I had to watch most of it on anothers screen because I was out of the fight. Some were lost through no fault of their own, they gave their lives for the cause. I solute you all, I am proud to stand among your ranks and be called an Ancient.</p>

It is however filled with terrifying monsters that live for the sole purpose of gnawing on the bones of those foolish enough to venture here.<br><br>So why would anyone be foolish enough to go here? Well that is exactly what I set out to find tonight, the reason. I joined a group of Ancients, grim faced and hardened by battle, these were a motley bunch of misfits. I will have to tell you I had great concerns as we faught our way to the very foot of the great Ssraeshza temple in the center of the zone. Once there my mind was put at ease as this band twisted and turned and conformed into one leathal killing machine. Arm to arm with their back to the temple they layed waste to all that dared near them. <br><br>I dont know that I learned the reason that folks go to the Grey, it is a frightening place no matter the company. I did not take home the riches and loot the great items of mythe that are said to be had in this zone. I did however learn something, something very valuable. Standing at the base of that temple, side by side with these great people, I learned what it meant to be an Ancient of the Realm. They are much more then what they appear, alone they may be nothing, but when they are together they are a force to be reckoned with. They are much more then the strength of their steel and the power of their magic. Their strength goes much deeper than that. They are friends.............</p>

    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This comes from <b>Tracker6</b> who was a very active Geezer during our glorious stint in STA Team Fortress League. *sigh* Those were the days... we were so young (for being old) and we had so many good times. Anyway... here's <b>T9</b>'s wrap-up:<br><br>August 23, 2002: OLD GEEZERS CELEBRATE (BELATEDLY) THREE YEARS OF PROSPERITY AND GROWTH<br><br>As the flurry of Geezer-gaming continued in to its third year of existence...we collectively felt a pang of shock and regret upon reading SlimWit's post on the Forum: HOW COULD WE FORGET?!!  Imagine the personal tragedy that befalls those unforgiven spouses who have committed the egregious sin of overlooking their wedding anniversary.  Quickly, upon realizing that our founding date had passed, the Old Geezers resolved to recognize the momentous occasion with a most befitting event, an All-Comers game of the saga that started it all three years ago: Team Fortress Classic.<br><br>And so, they came by the dozens (about two-dozen, to be more precise!).  Well before game time, Geezers were found loitering on our mIRC channel, waiting to check in and bid each other "Happy Anniversary".   [OGzr] mAdmOnk is reputed to boast the record of at least six-hours prior to game time (of course, he had the UK advantage working for him!).  After catching up on old news...who had new kids, who had a new job, who had been in jail...it was off to our very own Walker Wars server, graciously administered by [OGzr] JackhOle, and loaded with all our favorite maps.<br><br>'Lo...this was no organized, disciplined practice session in the traditional Geezer vane!  While the initial rust of re-learning old moves, positions and strategies was highly evident, the skills, camaraderie and teamwork seemed to come back quickly.  By the time "Well" was loaded, Geezers seemed to be coming back into old form, with strong defenses set-up around the FR, and routinely ferocious movement of the flag once it had been dropped to the bottom.  Crossover and Shutdown2 proved to be as enjoyable as always (though the concs just didn't seem as refined)...and 2Mesa3 proved as frustrating as it was the first day we practiced on that map!  So, it was fitting that with the clock approaching midnight for our East Coast bretheren, Geezers took their leave back to mIRC to talk smack about who crowbarred and wrenched who, and to say their goodnights.<br><br>We've come a long way: from TFC, to CS...to EQ and Tribes 2 (and don't forget Gang Wars!).  It's been a hell of a ride.  We can be proud that after three years of prosperity, Old Geezers from all of our Clan's generations returned on the Anniversary to experience what makes us unique in the Gaming community: maturity, camaraderie...and our trademark canes and wheelchairs!  See you next year.<br><br><a href="http://marz.org/cgi/mmartian/ogzr/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=1&t=001050"><i>Be sure to add your comments in the forum!</i></a><br></p>

Although a few persons short, 57th showed their resolve and played on through some great battles.<br><br>First map: Katabatic. Starting off with a flourish, 57th got the first touch on the flag, and the race was on. A tough 57th Offense made the Old Ones have to backup a step and put the brakes on the flag grabs. Some good midfield work on the part of both teams made the match a good one. However, when the dust settled, the Old Geezers were able to pull an 8-2 win.<br><br>Next was Sanctuary. The 57th Defense made our cappers earn every step of our attempts to capture the flag. 57th pulled one cap, but then our D held solid, and was able to get the flag back each time it disappeared from the stand. By the time the clock ran out, the Old Geezers had again won the map, but not without a hard fight. OGzr 2-1.<br><br>Last was Drifts(x), a new map to the BEML. After making sure that everyone was ready to go, the final map started, and 57th came out charging. Flying cappers everywhere. The Defense pulled up their Depends, and held fast to the flag. Meanwhile, mortars were flying around the 57th base, and our cappers were stopped numerous times at the flag stand. The OGzr Offense stepped it up a bit, and was able to pull a few flags out of the base and back home. OGzr 4-0.<br><br>Our hats off to the 57th group. They fought well, and are a great addition to the BEML. We wish them well, and hope to play them again soon.</p>

Both teams came out with mortars flying!  Lots of grabs were made and the score stayed close the entire map.  Ogzr pulled ahead with an early 3-1 lead.  However, the lead was short-lived and =W= pulled out a 5-4 victory on the map.<br><br>Great games =W= and well-fought.  Looking forward to the next matchup!<br></p>
