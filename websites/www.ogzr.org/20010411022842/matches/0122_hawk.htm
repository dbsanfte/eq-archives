        We just played <a href="http://www.clanhawk.com/" target="_blank">{HAWK}</a>
        on Darkness 2 weeks ago and they beat us pretty
        soundly. We were looking for some payback and managed to pull out a win.
        We have bad memories about Tempest, but this new version gave us fresh
        hope to put up a decent showing.
        <p>Round 1:<br>
        On {HAWK} server, pings very smooth and even. Nice! Pre-match ends and the
        scouts are off to the races. I think we had attackers in their base
        before {HAWK} had even cleared the bridge, but they had some Engineers
        quick with the wrench because our O was cut down pretty quickly. We
        finally started getting some movement on the flag and brought home a few
        caps. {HAWK}’s offense wasn’t far behind. They had some trouble
        getting a hand on our flag for the first half of the round but they
        eventually cracked the code and brought home several caps of their own.
        Our D held tight and held {HAWK} to a couple less caps than we got,
        including getting our flag to return a few times. Final for Round 1:
        72-53.</p>
        <p>Round 2:<br>
        Pings were a bit high on our server so we decided to play Round 2 back
        on the sweet {HAWK} server. {HAWK} needed a few extra minutes to start Round
        2, I think because of Roger Wilco or Battlecom problems. Round 2 started
        off the same, except this time our initial rush was more successful.
        Their Engineers must have spawned at the wrong side of the base. {HAWK}’s D was much tighter this time. Everywhere we turned we saw a
        Sentry Sun or a Soldier licking his chops. {HAWK} knew they had to score
        some to make up the difference and their attacks were relentless. The
        bridge was slippery with all the goo leftover from the mid-field
        scrimming. However, our D held incredibly tight only allowing one cap
        and a few movement points. Meanwhile, if our offense was able to get
        past the bridge, we were getting decent touches on their flag and
        managed to pull out a handful of caps to solidify our lead. {HAWK} kept
        pushing but just couldn’t break out. Round 2: 63-19.</p>
        <p>Final score: 140-72. Good game {HAWK}. Good luck in the future.
