        First round 203 - 212. <a target="_blank" href="http://run.to/ad">[A-D]</a>
        started out strong. They attacked our base with brutal force. They
        capped points fairly fast and almost had a quick &quot;All Cap&quot;.
        Towards the end of the round, the Old Geezers made a strong comeback,
        but it was to no avail. They came just short of an &quot;All Cap&quot;
        as the time ran out.<br>
        <br>
        Second round 171 - 245. The second round started out fairly even with
        cap points changing back and forth. The mach was even more intense then
        the first. It seemed very evenly paced when out of the blue the Attach
        Doggs made a strong surge. They capped all points except for 1. They
        even had a man on guard there waiting for his scout. It was very close
        to being an &quot;All Cap&quot; for them. After coming back and
        reclaiming some cap points, the Geezers had some technical difficulties
        and three players dropped about the same time. With some switching of
        positions and extra scout work by our defense, we were able to keep this
        from being an complete disaster. The match ended with the Attack Doggs
        taking the round and the match. Good games guys!</td>
