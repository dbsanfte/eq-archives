    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">If you've been wondering why there hasn't been an update about our WoW activities and if you lost your faith and feared that we stopped playing: think again!  We've been playing so much lately that there has not been enough time for an update.  When it comes to deciding between updating the Web site and questing with The Old Guard, trust me when I say that The Old Guard wins and wins always.<br><br>So, where to  begin?  We are up to <b>six</b> level 60s: Edeilirra, Eownmacmedb, Kikash, Kutlachs, Slimwit, and Valrain (with Chovak nearly there).  We have our first Elite Mount (congratulations Eownmacmedb!).  Valrain has achieved the highest PvP rank amongst us at Sergeant Major and is one step away from the Officers' Barracks.  Finally, we've knocked out some pretty high-level content and are excited that a ton still remains.  I'm going to group all the pictures at the end, but what you'll see is Maraudon, the Sunken Temple, Blackrock Depths, and the Marshal Windsor escort completion which leads eventually to one of the biggest and most difficult 40 player Raid instances: Onyxia.  We have a little more work left in BRD, but our adventures may take us into Dire Maul in the near future.<br><br>As always, we are looking for like-minded gamers to join us on Argent Dawn.

There was not much planning beforehand but it proved to be great fun nonetheless.  The party was Valrain (lvl 45 Hunter), Eownmacmedb (lvl 45 Druid), SlimWit (lvl 45 Priest) Edeilirra (lvl 42 Warrior), and Chovak (lvl 38 Rogue).  This was a group adventuring together in a significant scenario for the first time in this fivesome.

We started with the easiest of the three and steadily moved through the dungeons.  As you would expect, there were numerous books to read in the Monestary; some so interesting that you sometimes forgot what you were doing and why you were there...then again, maybe that was only my problem.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/031205/agoodbook.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/031205/agoodbook.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br><br>We tried a variety of attacking strategies and found that Chovak's sneaky ways really allowed us to control the opening of each battle when we hit the groups of two or more.  There were a couple of moments where this did not work, however.  On at least one occassion, dispatching a key enemy caused a swarm of enemy to respond, overwhelming us to a humorous point at least once.  Fortunately, Valrain was patient enough for the rest of us to return as she survived this swarming by feigning death.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/031205/overwhelmed.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/031205/overwhelmed.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br><br>The fact that it took three separate instances to complete the quests we had lead to a late night we old people, especially because each instance respawned many of the monsters.  We had to fight our way in and out in two cases.  In the end, The Old Guard was successful: we completed our quests and had fun doing it, not to mention the fact we learned quite a bit.  Valrain gained level 46 and the loot was decent.  After defeating the final enemy (one of them twice as he was resurrected), we gathered for a group picture and rode hearthstones home.

    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The Old Guard has been very active in recent weeks, but last night a few of us met to take on some new "instance" content on the Western shores of Kalimdor in the Blackfathom Deeps.  After putting a call out to Kutlachs (lvl 33 Warrior) and him dying a few times on the cross-ocean feature ("a feature"), Valrain (lvl 38 Hunter), Eownmacmedb (lvl 29 Druid), and SlimWit (lvl 38 Priest) picked up a non-Guild but equally worthy party member in Ruta (lvl 30 Druid) and ventured into the Deeps.  Both Ruta and Eownmacmedb had been here before and were our seasoned guides, but neither had seen it to the end of the instance.<br><br>Like other instances, the path to the portal was harried but we eventually made it through.  Our progress was steady through the instance with a lot of underwater battling.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/011705/seawitch.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/011705/seawitch.gif"></IMG></A><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/011705/moreunderwater.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/011705/moreunderwater.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>Unfortunately, Ruta has some serious connection issues and was dropped  and didn't reconnect until we were almost done.  Eownmacmedb also had a connection, but was able to rejoin us and remain connected to completion.<br><br>I must say that the dungeon was very impressive and worth the time investment.  We fought underwater and on the surface; casters and melee enemies; humanoid and summoned pets; all with one thing in common: triple the life as everything was "elite."  We have one particular battle towards the end where the enemies kept coming and coming that was extremely fun.  Then, soon after, we got a little cocky and did not heed our guide's advice of "don't touch the candles and stay away from the middle."  Well, it seems that translated in our heads as "hey, this is interactive...I wonder what happens when I click it?"  Instead of taking 20 or so enemies in 1/4 at a time, they all rushed us and we all paid for our lack of respect.  No worries, though, as this instance is not a re-spawning one: we returned to our corpses, resurrected, were rejoined by Ruta, and proceeded through again, taking a turn or two that we missed before to close a quest for Kutlachs.  Into the room where we died with a little more caution rewarded us with victory and access to the final boss, which Kutlachs pulled brilliantly and we made short work of.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/011705/finalbattle.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/011705/finalbattle.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>While the adventure may not have gained us many experience points, it was great content, the drops were fine, the cash was decent, and the quest rewards were excellent.  Well done, all!</p>

The Imperial armies ruled it for centuries. The Emperor valued its use and saw that Arx Mercatus was watched over by the soldiers of the Adeptus Astartes, and led by a trusted commander, Librarian Hernnahan of the Dark Angels.<br><br>The evils of Chaos were always at work, looking for ways to dethrone the false Emperor. The Blood God Khorne was alerted to the importance of the stronghold. Khorne wished to ruin the Emperor and cut off all trade through this route.

Although the bodies of many soldiers from either side were destroyed, the stronghold still stood. Librarian Hernnahan was able to empower his troops to hold their position and maintain the Stronghold. It took all of Hernnahan's power to do so, and in the end it was his undoing. Somehow, among the fighting, a lone assassin had crept into the main fortress. Stabbing Hernnahan in the back and killing him in an instant, the assassin fled with his mission successful.

He taunted us but, in the end, perished like his friends.  After him, it was a long haul through encounter after encounter. We modified our pulling strategy during the quest because once Valrain hit a monster, it wanted only to taste Valrain's blood and we preferred to keep our enemy in front of us more consistently.  Eventually, we did encounter VanCleef and his hirelings and defeated him after putting up with his overly confident boastings...dirt nap for VanCleef and good loot for us all.</p>

Our shining moment was a much harried battle against at least six gnolls, each our level or higher.  Everyone in the group was patient and didn't panic, and our only loss was the valiant pet Thathos.  We mourned his loss and healed in order to continue the fight.  In the end, the only death our party suffered was due to a server crash or disconnection for all and I was able to gain a level (Priest 23).

The experience gained from this encounter was enough for Kutlachs to level (now Warrior 22). <br><br>We did very well tonight and I think our proudest moment was not panicking against larger numbers and being patient enough to keep everyone alive and kicking.</p>

    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">We put together a pretty strong group last night with Valrain (21 Hunter), Kutlachs (20 Warrior), Kikash (16 Paladin), and myself (22 Priest) to take on a couple of elite quests in Loch Modan that I wrote about <a href="#newsitem1101996285,47097,">earlier</a>.  The plan was to head out to complete the first quest and level Kikash to 17 so he could get credit for completing the Chok'sul quest.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/ogreparty.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/ogreparty.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>That strategy went well as we easily completed the first elite quest and Kikash hit the requisite level 17 for the next quest.  Additionally, we were joined by Edeilirra.  We entered the cave to battle the mighty Chok'sul.  The adventure here is best summarized by "Just like a Geezer to bring a knife to a gunfight."  <br><br>We assisted another party in their quest by handling the additional monsters besides Chok'sul before we got our chance.  We waited for Chok'sul to respawn, and waited, and waited, and waited.  Finally, he spawns with his two friends, but unbeknownst to us, two more behind us spawned.  We weren't able to handle the encounter and ended up wiping and all running on water to retrieve our corpses.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/wiped.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/wiped.gif"></IMG></A><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/runningonwater.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/runningonwater.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>So, we regrouped and tried again, and again, and again, and again.  I think we wiped at least five times.  Also, Blizzard dropped Kutlachs with their random patching mechanism and we wiped then, too.  Finally, with our equipment close to breaking, we engage a higher level party to provide covering fire for us to handle the adds.  Well, that stroke of genius proved to be very timely, as we made short order of Chok'sul and returned to town to lick our wounds.  The quest rewards were excellent and we absolutely learned a ton.<br><br>I was in need of visiting the Elf city of Darnassus to train with their Artisan Alchemist. Valrain and I took the boat to Darkshore, flew from Darkshore to Teldrassil, and ran to the Elven capital.  To cap the night off, we fished a bit before retiring.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/flyingtodarnassus.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/flyingtodarnassus.gif"></IMG></A><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/fishingwithfriends.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/120804/fishingwithfriends.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER></p>

    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I stumbled onto an unbelievable gaming session this morning.  As some of you know, I awake at 5am to get a couple of hours of grinding and other administrative stuff done.  I don't expect much out of this time; I was <B>very</B> wrong about that this morning...this morning was on of the best times I've had in-game, yet.  It's always a pleasant surprise to group with people you don't know and actually have a fun time.  World of Warcraft is a great game and my gaming in the early hours connects me with fellow serious and mature players.<br><br>I was headed out to the East side of Loch Modan to pick up a few quests.  As I was waiting for the NPC to show up, I partied with a level 15 Dwarf Paladin so we could do the quest at the same time and not have to wait further.  We escorted the NPC to <a target=“_blank” href=http://i1.thottbot.com/Interface/WorldMap/LochModan/LochModanbig.jpg>Ironbad's Excavation Site</a> and I picked up a quest that the Paladin said he had difficulty with earlier.<br><br>We ventured into the excavation site and started knocking off some mobs, and were joined by a level 18 Night Elf Warrior.  He helped tremendously in pulling and holding aggro.  We completed that quest for all three of us, feeling rather flush with our success, I must admit.<br><br>The Dark Elf asked if we wanted to try the two Elite quests in Loch Modan and we agreed after the ease of completing the former quest.  Along the way we found a Gnome Mage and asked if he wanted to join us.  He inspected us and surmised that we'd need a lot more horsepower to survive and departed.  No hard feelings on our part, but we decided to focus on the lower of the two quests based on his feedback: <a target=“_blank” href=http://www.thottbot.com/?q=666>Mercenaries</a>.<br><br>We approached the ogre camp with some trepidation based on the Gnome's wisdom, and inched slowly against the ogres.  The Warrior pulled one and I quickly went through my mana as we defeated it.  Being out of mana as a Priest is not a good thing for the party, so I began to scale back my damage spells a bit.  We made nice progress against the quest but only because we were engaging one or two at a time.<br><br>Along came a level 23 Dark Elf Hunter and we invited him to join us.  That addition to the party really turned the tide against the ogres and we made quick work of the quest, pushed into the cave, and made the decision to go for Loch Modan's other known Elite quest: <a target=“_blank” href=http://www.thottbot.com/?q=661>WANTED: Chok'sul Alliance</a><br><br>The pace was pretty frenetic.  So much so that I don't have the normal screenshots to share with you unfortunately.  We engaged more ogres in the cave (level 19 or 20) and made it to Chok'sul's chamber, where 2 casting ogres and Chok'sul were waiting.  The fight was a long one, and I was largely in the role of healer as I should have been.  The Priest's Power Word: Shield was invaluable to our survival.  After eliminating his companions, we focused on Chok'sul and defeated him with tanks at 50% health and a dead pet for the Hunter who was a true hero in the engagement.<br><br>I'll spare you the details of returning to Loch Modan (I died once, we fought the Loch Ness Monster, etc.), but I do want to share the rewards.  Twenty silver pieces for the Mercenaries quest, and for Chok'sul: <a target=“_blank” href=http://www.thottbot.com/?i=2525>Minor Channeling Ring</a> and <a target=“_blank” href=http://www.thottbot.com/?i=2535>Kimbra Boots</a>, as well as a new level for me, <a target=“_blank” href=http://wow.allakhazam.com/profile.html?2433>SlimWit</a>.</p>

I recall seeing four or five Old Geezers logged in at the same time.  We grouped for the first time and made some significant quest progress.

Unfortunately, no one told us that we were the turf part of the meal as we were clearly outmatched by monsters of a much higher level than most of us.  We persevered, recovered our corpses, and retreated to the city for the evening.<br><br>The weekend gaming for me wrapped up this afternoon with some great work with Stumpmen as uber-tank.  We completed a long quest for a stew recipe and then cleared out some bandits from a neighboring farm.  During that time, Stumpmen was able to work on his mining skill and, after I purchased the Guild Charter for 10sp, we had our first two guild members sign up.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/112804/ivebeenworkingontherailroad.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/112804/ivebeenworkingontherailroad.gif"></IMG></A><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/112804/guildstart.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/112804/guildstart.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>A good weekend for all...I think Valrain is leading the pack with a level 17 Hunter.

There is a reason they call it “EverCrack” I think.  That feeling, however, is in direct opposition of the cheap gaming b@st@rd in me that can’t pass up free multi-player gaming.  So, when a friend at work mentioned that I should try the Open Beta of World of Warcraft (WoW), I said “sure.”  Well, I liken the “Open Beta” to “high school heroin dealer” as they both put out free stuff to get you hooked and then you willingly pay later.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/111804/valandslim.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG  SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/111804/valandslim.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>I was finally able to hook up with <a HREF="http://ogzr.org/forum/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_profile;u=00000159">aspalmat</a> last night.  We’ve been talking a lot about the game but haven’t been able to meet-up in-person until last night.  My friend at work (Valrain) and I traversed to the Dark Elf island and met <a HREF="http://ogzr.org/forum/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_profile;u=00000159">aspalmat</a> before he logged off.

Valrain and I decided to join the raid to see how it went.<br><br>First step was to get from the Dark Elf island to the enemy.  We took hippogriffs to the next land and then boats to the land after that.  I recall that <a HREF="http://ogzr.org/forum/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_profile;u=00000159">aspalmat</a> mentioned in chat that the transportation is a lot quicker and more often in WoW than in the original EverQuest, FWIW.

Those that didn’t had to take the long and dangerous land route which just happened to skirt the enemy land.  At that fork in the road, a lot of the raid participants (40 in total) turned North to the Undead city instead of South to the rally point.  They got slaughtered as their numbers were small and they were relatively unsupported.  You see, there was only one priest out of the forty players in the raid...not a good thing.<br><CENTER><A HREF="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/111804/griffontoloch.jpg" TARGET="_BLANK"><IMG SRC="http://ogzr.org/slimwit/newsposts/111804/griffontoloch.gif"></IMG></A></CENTER><br>While we were cooling our heels in Loch Modan waiting for numbers, the enemy Horde had attacked in significant numbers on Kalimdor which is the western big island and the first stop mentioned above.

This was a massive PvP battle of Horde against Alliance.  I have never seen as many corpses in all my time in this game.  Unfortunately, our numbers were down to about 30 with others following.

We were to play AOW but CGI also showed up and we all decided to do a 3-way. CGI has been around for a long time. Just like AOW their a great bunch of guys who love to play Ghost Recon the way it was meant to be played.<br><br>The Battles...!<br><br>The match started out with CGI winning the first map. AOW took the second. The Geezers first win cam on the 5th map. We trailed the other teams 2-2-1. CGI and AOW won the next 3 maps before the Old Geezers won their second. We trailed the other teams by the score of 4-3-2 with CGI in the lead. The battles were brutal and furious. Each team moving in formation to engage the enemy and at times one team getting slammed quickly by the other two.<br><br>THE Defense...!<br><br>It was now midnight. The War still raging. A few maps ended in draws with the Geezers battling hard to stop the on-slaught from the other two teams. CGI was a dominating team. Their aggressive style of play made it difficult to formulate plans and tactics. We continued to find ourselves defending from the SHOCK and AWE Spamming and pounding they delivered upon us but still we survived. We were not to be pounded, not in our server.<br><br>THE COME BACK...!<br><br>With the score CGI 4 AOW 3 Geezers 3, we decided it was time to take the battle to them. It's our turn to pound AOW and CGI. It was time to take back the maps we lost and it was time to show them. We WILL NOT SURRENDER!<br>We won a desperately need map keeping the Geezers alive and in the hunt. Now with 3 wins, we entered the next map feeling a little more confident that we could actually win. Unfortunately, AOW took the next map. It wasn't luck; it was good gaming that put them ahead. CGI and AOW now each had 4 wins. But still we felt good that we had given them a good match with 3 wins. The next map started slow with each team playing very cautiously. We got a great spawn point. Geezers started to Spam the other spawn points just as the timer reached the end of the map and scored a couple of lucky hits.<br>It was unbelievable that we won. We took the map and tied the match at 4 wins apiece. We survived and now we decided we weren’t going to lose.<br><br>The Final MAP...!<br><br>Tied at 4 wins apiece it was anyone’s match. The map started and the OGzr Ghost Recon Team moved out. We spammed a spawn point and got a lucky kill. Knowing where the other 2 team were we took an aggressive position one where we could attack from. Ahead of us there were sounds of gunfire and massive explosions similar to the SHOCK and AWE campaign unleashed by the U.S. in Iraq. AOW and CGI were battling hard, still we waited. Cautiously like a predator, while our enemies killed themselves. After a few minutes of silence we move out on the final attack. Cint got shot but was able to communicate with me where he was. Lt.Sam killed the enemy while Dent and Wild Flanked the other side. With 2 CGI and no AOW left alive, the Geezers attacked.<br><br>The VICTORY...!<br><br>With seconds left on the clock The OGzr's cornered the last remaining CGI players. Lt.Sam got killed by a sniper who was near Wild. Wild saw the tracers and found the enemy. With a single bullet Wild extinguished the CGI sniper... Victory was ours...!<br><br>Final score [OGzr]5 / CGI 4 / AOW 4<br><br>THE END...!<br><br><br></p>

Alpha Moved out to the right on most maps and Charlie moving to the left. In a Pincer style of play we squeezed our enemy close together and forced them into the trap, where Bravo Squad was waiting. The Team played extremely well. All team members scored kills and supported their teammate with covering fire. Top Thud and 30+ also played well, but for them, it was a bloody and brutal night. The [OGzr]Ghost Recon Team Shock and Awe style of play overwhelmed both their defenses and it allowed us to roll through. <br><br>History is written by the Victor and on Friday night the [OGzr]'s were the Victor.<br><br>The final score was [OGzr]'s 5, [TT] 1 and [30+] 1.<br><br><br>Recap: It was a great night of gaming with 2 other great clans..

The Geezers spawned on the high ground. Wild went on the offensive killing two =SW=. Cint also scored a kill as he naded the enemy tango up against the corner wall.

Dent met him as he was charging up the ramp on the beach side of the map. In a hail of bullets Dent fell. Thrashe was the last enemy opponent left and he was making it tough. Now behind our lines Thrashe had to be stopped.. Lt.Sam ran to cut off Thrashe and block his escape. Near the edge wall Lt.Sam waited for the unsuspecting Thrashe to run by.

With this title and two other key announcements to come in the next few days, Ubisoft is expanding its lineup of war games to every segment of the military category, from historical to near future, and aggressively positioning itself in the competitive war games market which accounted for 5 out of the top 10 shooter franchises in 2003. The Ghost Recon™ franchise contributed greatly to the strength of this segment with more than 5 million copies sold worldwide.<br><br>"Our ultimate goal is to become the primary player in the military shooter game arena, thanks to both our internal studios, proven to be amongst the best in the world in this category, and also through strategic alliances with high profile 3rd party developers," said Yves Guillemot, Ubisoft's President and CEO. "Stay tuned for more announcements that will significantly expand this area of the industry and further reinforce our overall military strategy."<br><br>Developed by Ubisoft's award-winning Red Storm studio, Ghost Recon 2 launches on next-generation consoles and PC this Holiday season. The game is set in the chaotic battlefields of tomorrow, and will offer gamers an insider's view of the way large scale conflicts will be fought in the near future.<br><br>"Ghost Recon has established itself as a mega-selling franchise, and we've retained the core elements that made the first game such a success," said Laurent Detoc, President of Ubisoft, Inc. "But for Ghost Recon 2, we wanted to dial up the intensity and adrenaline to create an experience of total war. We've retooled and improved every aspect of the game, and have integrated a host of incredible new features - and the result is amazing. You will truly feel like you are the hero of a near-future war movie when playing this game."<br><br>Ghost Recon 2 will continue the tradition of intensity and realism associated with Ubisoft's Tom Clancy brand, with an emotionally charged storyline, a completely redesigned graphics engine and the most intuitive gameplay to date, to fully immerse gamers into the chaos of a high tech war. The game will offer more action than ever before, as it puts players in command of an elite squad of special forces thrust into a tense political situation in East Asia. In addition, the top-notch multiplayer action that gamers expect from Red Storm will once again place Ghost Recon at the top of online console and PC gaming and will be a must-have for all online gaming fans this holiday season.</p>

All map play was close with some showing the expertice of some of the Geezer squad. Many maps had one player rising to the task with multiple kills. New member Dent played well . the RWG team went to 4 maps to 3 on the Geezer team. Not to be denied the squad won the next map pulliing even on maps 4-4. Then the match winning map came up. It was Village. The Geezer team got the bad spawn and was down players in a blink of the eye. This left JR all alone and pinned down. He was not to be denied and defeated 4 of their players alone to win the match for the Geezer team. This puts the team in a good spot to break into the top 10 at TCZ.<br> The OGzr team welcomes new members Wild and Dent to the team</p>

Perhaps it was the earlier practice session or perhaps it was AoS Ha\/ok having too many drinks(not that that is a bad thing)yet the team won. It was a great win and a fun one also.

LtSam went on a fairly long expedition only to be gunned down by an expecting enemy...but JR followed behind to avenge his death.  POW Camp was a disappointing loss, and a virtual grenade-fest.  [OGzr] scored their second win on another favorite, Docks, where LtSam again went hunting, and this time bagged three enemy.

Spawning on high ground, JR and Tracker6 teamed up with 1 kill each on the near-spawn corridor, while Stat and Vaulden blocked up the far corridor, each with a kill.  JR finished the map by killing the sole remaining bad guy.<br><br>After an extended "intermission" where *RWG* could catch their breath, [OGzr] returned to lose the next 4 maps straight.  Aurora and Ghost Town were disappointing losses...possibly a symptom of being over-confident on maps that [OGzr] feels comfortable with.  After adding a sixth player to each side, *RWG* took Market and Night Castle before Old Geezers regrouped on Battlefield.  Vaulden and Stat aggressively hunted the enemy and killed 2 each.  LtSam iced another enemy to leave the remaining *RWG* player alone and outnumbered.  As [OGzr] reduced their perimeter, the bad guy exposed himself by firing at LtSam, and Tracker6 zoomed in on an easy target.<br><br>Tied at 4-4...the teams spawned on the expected rubber match, Mountain.  [OGzr] went down quickly, and with time running out, it looked like *RWG* would maintain a 1 player advantage.  Alas, LtSam scored a well-placed shot to force the match to another map.  On River, the map progressed similarly, with [OGzr] suffering a 1 man deficit...until JR tossed an amazing grenade long-distance with 2 minutes left to force another map.  Unfortunately, even though [OGzr] took the lead early on Roadblock, *RWG* showed true perseverance and edged out a win.<br><br>The match was one of the most spirited in recent [OGzr] history...we tip our caps to *RWG*, a well-disciplined and fun opponent.

Tracker6 drew first blood, but was killed by the late-*CoRe* player as he got off a lucky round.  Stat rallied to avenge both T6 and Cint's deaths.

After avenging T6 and Stat's deaths, he scored his third kill on the map...but was unfortunately slain by a stray bullet, narrowly missing a draw.  [OGzr] took an extended pee-break before the next map, Night Battle, and it paid off.  Stat quickly killed two *CoRe* players trying to flank his position...JR added a third kill.  With only 1 enemy left, Stat moved into commanding terrain, and was able to maintain cover while the lone *CoRe* player stalked the remaining Geezers.  Stat added the final kill of the map, bringing [OGzr] their first map win of the night.<br><br>On Day Farm, it appeared as if the Geezers would maintain momentum.  JR silenced 2 enemy, but a rogue sniper hugged the ground, killing T6, LtSam and JR, before Cint was left to fend for himself.  Before Mountain Stronghold, *CoRe* StoneCold joined to make the final 2 maps of the night 5v5.  This turned out to be a bad omen for [OGzr]...for even though Stat killed 2 enemy on the map, StoneCold unleashed his fury, killing 4 [OGzr] and pulling a draw out of thin air.  On the final map of the night, Prison, the Geezers ran out of breath...<br><br>[OGzr] looks forward to another meeting with *CoRe*, always a classy bunch.

Unfortunately, this was the last gasp for the Geezers; *CoRe* took out their superior night-vision goggles to blank [OGzr] on Aurora, and then showed up on Beach...where at least LtSam killed one enemy as he crossed the wall...while Cint tried to fool everyone by standing straight up and playing rabbit!

The match set several records for The Old Geezer Ghost Recon squad, including:<br><br>Longest Match: 3 hrs. 40 minutes<br>Most Maps: 16<br>Most Draws: 8<br><br>After the first four maps, [OGzr] led 2-1, and felt confident that their stamina would carry them through to ultimate victory.  Winning first on Docks, the Geezers suffered an early sniper kill, but 30+ spawned on the western dock and decided to stay put, sealing their fate.  Tracker6 succeed in killing 3 enemy as they loitered behind their cover, and the rest of the Geezers closed in to prevent [30+] from breaking out.  [30+] turned around on then next map, Market, and beat the Geezers in a final 1-on-1 duel with sfpops.  JR returned on map 3, Beaches, to help secure the second OGzr victory of the night.  The map appeared to be heading for a draw, but JR notched his second map kill with only 5 seconds left to assure victory.<br><br>The Geezers accounted for their third win on map 7, Beach Resort.  JR, Cint and LtSam all scored 2 kills each to exterminate [30+].  The map required a tremendous amount of movement, as the Geezers spawned in the SW, and moved clockwise all the way to the top of the map, clearing enemy out of the resort, and icing the remaining [30+] players while they were wading in the water.  In true [30+] style, they returned to win the next map, Train Depot, by blanking OGzr without a single kill.  [OGzr] managed to stabilize themselves next on Red Square by pulling a draw after getting bunched up in a difficult spawn point.  Stat was the lone Geezer to break out, and scored two kills by working his way along the opposite side of the map.  [30+] tied the match score at 3-3 later when they won on Village...even after sfpops got his first kill of the night!<br><br>The Geezers couldn't manage to regain their strength, and suffered several more draws and 2 losses on Battlefield and RRBridge to lose the match.  More likely...the geritol bottles ran low, and with the wives already in bed, no one was available to provide a quick resupply.  Though retiring in defeat, the Geezers played well together, and thoroughly enjoyed matching another classy, mature GR clan.  We look forward to matching again, [30+]...and this time, we'll start at noon!<br><br><b>Final Score:  [OGzr]</b>...3  <b>[30+]</b>...5<br></p>

    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It was "old timers" versus "older timers" tonight, as the [OGzr] men in wheelchairs met-up with 7 rest home residents from clan The Final Option [TFO]. Not only was this the first ever 7v7 match for the Old Geezer GR Squad...it was the first time we played against not 1, but 2 players who are actually older than our own beloved sfpops!<br><br>After welcoming [OGzr]Thar T'Pak to his first team match, the Geezers checked their "bins" and launched into 'River'.  [TFO] flooded the top of the map and rained down OICW shells until [OGzr]sfpops was last man standing.  He successfully took down 1 enemy, but was quickly silenced.  The Geezers fared much better with 'Red Square', where both teams spawned directly across from each other and fought back and forth from impenetrable cover.  Stat cleaned up a couple bad guys to start the round, and LtSam expertly maneuvered around the flank to reduce the map to only 2 enemy.  Still, the Geezers couldn't hold them off, and [TFO] advanced, score 2-0.<br><br>The Geezers caught fire on the next two maps.  Recovering from an early tragic team kill, [OGzr]Tracker6 and [OGzr]sfpops finished 'Ravine' with a draw by working in tandem to kill 2 enemy each.  [TFO] met their match on Map#4, 'Farm Day'.  Cint made quick contact on the bottom of the map, and JR made contact up top.  The remaining [TFO] players insisted on running across the open field...and right into Tracker6's sights, who left 4 enemy bleeding to death center map.  LtSam brought the 3 remaining Geezers in tight to wait out their hard-fought win.<br><br>Trailing only 2-1 going into Map#5, 'Valley' got the better of [OGzr].  Cint and Stat worked well together, as Cint scored a couple of kills with well tossed grenades.  In the end, Stat played cat-and-mouse with the remaining [TFO] player until the 2 met gun-muzzle to gun-muzzle.  The next map, 'High Sierra', may as well have been named 'Rape in the Sierras' as [TFO] swept the Geezers without losing a single man.  In the last map, 'Train Depot', Thar, LtSam and JR headed up the hill to a meeting engagement with several [TFO].  JR killed 1 with a grenade and 1 with a bullet, but the squad was flanked by two enemy, and met an untimely end.  The map was methodically reduced until 5 enemy chased the lone [OGzr] Stat.  Using the buildings and train cars to his advantage, the outnumbered Stat successfully murdered 2 enemy, but was eventually killed.<br><br>[TFO] demonstrated a very aggressive style of play and excellent mastery of the maps.  [OGzr] raises their canes to their fellow Depends-wearing opponents, and wheels off to bed.  Final Score: 5-1-1.</p>

On the final map of the night, the Geezers were able to get to good firing positions to reduce [30+] around the Military Camp, with Cintillious and JR each downing one and Lt.Sam taking two.<br><br>It was a professional and enjoyable match for the Old Geezers.

Coming off of a very productive training camp with Clan FR last week, the Geezers immediately put into action its position strategy.

Round 4 was ugly; the Old Ones had poor spawn placement, and Recon Battalion showed their true mastery of sniping from what seemed like all directions (PaleRider scored the only kill).

Geezers worked a good checkerboard pattern to cover all avenues on the map, and used team communication well to identify enemy locations.<br><br>Round 4:  A heartbreaking tie, where a Geezer 2 v 1 advantage was lost with one second left in the round!!  Pale Rider and T6 went down quickly...then sfpops began to snipe like a king!

The battle raged around him as he lay there helpless to offer anything save advise.

Her trust that the others would not let her fall and their trust that she would not quit, not run, not fail in the task they had appointed her.....<br><br>Oh what battles they faught.

This night, the Plane of Disease would be explored even at the cost of our lives if need be. The brave souls at the beginning of the journey included Marloon, talented mage and master of the elements; Baron Saxmoore, the powerful wizard and leader of our small army; Baronness (?) Cristineiya, the druid, one with nature and bearer of formidable earthen magics; Halicia, faithful vicar and restorer of life; Sindaria, the beguiling Enchantress, able to fascinate and charm the worst of beasts long enough for us to vanquish their brethren; and myself, a humble Cavalier of Marr, ready to bear the brunt of whatever onslaught we might face in that blighted place.<br><br>After speaking to the keeper of the gateway to the outskirts of Bertoxx' plane to get clearance to enter, we all leapt into the gate itself, a huge foul-looking spigot, ever flowing with unnatural murky waters. We arrived in the graveyard of this dark humid place, surrounded by the corpses of other adventurers, a warning perhaps? This was a hideous place, sticky fetid humid, with an evil odor drifting from the rivers of waste that flow thru it. We made our way thru the huge hairs growing out of the ground, past several other brave souls, til we found a clearing near a nest of venomous spiders. I set off to bring one to us and its offspring, which I hadn't seen, came as well. To our shock these evil beasts tend to wield magics almost as powerful as our own, so our Enchantress had to weave her spell of fascination on one, keeping it enthralled as we destroyed the other. Marloon's elemental servant fought valiantly as I kept the attention of the huge arachnid. Halicia saved my life many times over, completely healing me as this vicious....thing, tore into my armored form. Cristineiya while summoning thorny vines to shield me and damage the beast, also managed to patch a wound that might have killed me seconds before Halicia's healing could take effect, thus once again saving the life of this humble knight. Finally, with a devastating blast from our wizard we vanquished the more powerful of the 2 and went to work destroying its foul offspring. This went on in similar fashion for a time, until a crafty pair of spiders finally got the better of me, as one held my attention as it's cunning sibling relentlessly attacked our beloved healer. It refused to be deterred even by Sindaria's considerable enchantments. I swore beneath my breath as I turned, much too late, to see faithful Halicia fall to its fangs. Vowing vengeance, I shouted to Baron Saxmoore to call upon his magics to whisk the others clear as I too fell to their attack, mercilessly struck down from behind by the original monster....<br><br>Later after Halicia called on her(his) powers to revive us, we ventured out again, unfortunately without the assistance of the mage Marloon, but we attracted the attention of an outrider of considerable experience who was exploring the area on his own, traveling under the name of Breowan. He assisted us in ridding the area of scores of its revolting inhabitants, including different varieties of tsetsian flies, larvae, and vile pox-ridden disease infested rats. He fell valiantly at one point in the battle as well but Halicia speedily returned him to the fight. All in all, I think we made our mark on this foul place, though it did seem to mock us as we left and more vile fiends appeared to replace those we laid waste to...<br><br>(as you can see, it's a slow day at work. long story short we went to PoD camped spiders, whacked em, me and Hali died once, then mar left and breowan was tryin to solo where we were pulling from. we took all spawns so he joined our group. He died once, then we killed stuff til we got sleepy and left......Jaimekash</p>

    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Tonight, the Ancients gathered in Greater Faydark for a trip to the plane of sky. When all were gathered and ready Cal ported us up. Island one went great and we got our keys with no problems at all. We then moved to island two and the home of Gwan, our target. <br><br>Everyone was in the wind mill which is the center piece for this tiny island, they were all buffed as planned, this is the last thing that went right for the team. <br><br>The plan was for Gymli to aggro Gwan and pull him into the wind mill where everyone else would kill him. Chrac did the hand in, said the magic words, and the fun began. Gymli got Gwan to the ramp then got blown backwards off the island and out of the zone. Dan took over as MA and we proceeded to hack him good. Then Dan gets summoned outside on a bad pathing deal and blown off the island. Now here is where things get realy crazy. Chracner and Graphyte start ping ponging Gwan back and forth until finally Chracner gets blown out of the mill and off the island. Now if you are keepin score, Chracner is the reason they went to this place, and now they have lost not 1 but 3 tanks from the main group. Now at this point most weaker souls would have packed their bags and took the leap off the side off the island, but not our team. Graphyte, who for the record is ten levels lower then Gwan, gave him a timely 650 point Harm touch to get its his attention, and group two, with the tattered remains of one took it to the hoop. <br><br>Now some would say that we are weak for having had it get that out of control. I say we did it our way and won. That was quite possibly 5 minutes of the most intense fighting I have seen in game to date, and I had to watch most of it on anothers screen because I was out of the fight. Some were lost through no fault of their own, they gave their lives for the cause. I solute you all, I am proud to stand among your ranks and be called an Ancient.</p>

It is however filled with terrifying monsters that live for the sole purpose of gnawing on the bones of those foolish enough to venture here.<br><br>So why would anyone be foolish enough to go here? Well that is exactly what I set out to find tonight, the reason. I joined a group of Ancients, grim faced and hardened by battle, these were a motley bunch of misfits. I will have to tell you I had great concerns as we faught our way to the very foot of the great Ssraeshza temple in the center of the zone. Once there my mind was put at ease as this band twisted and turned and conformed into one leathal killing machine. Arm to arm with their back to the temple they layed waste to all that dared near them. <br><br>I dont know that I learned the reason that folks go to the Grey, it is a frightening place no matter the company. I did not take home the riches and loot the great items of mythe that are said to be had in this zone. I did however learn something, something very valuable. Standing at the base of that temple, side by side with these great people, I learned what it meant to be an Ancient of the Realm. They are much more then what they appear, alone they may be nothing, but when they are together they are a force to be reckoned with. They are much more then the strength of their steel and the power of their magic. Their strength goes much deeper than that. They are friends.............</p>

    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This comes from <b>Tracker6</b> who was a very active Geezer during our glorious stint in STA Team Fortress League. *sigh* Those were the days... we were so young (for being old) and we had so many good times. Anyway... here's <b>T9</b>'s wrap-up:<br><br>August 23, 2002: OLD GEEZERS CELEBRATE (BELATEDLY) THREE YEARS OF PROSPERITY AND GROWTH<br><br>As the flurry of Geezer-gaming continued in to its third year of existence...we collectively felt a pang of shock and regret upon reading SlimWit's post on the Forum: HOW COULD WE FORGET?!!  Imagine the personal tragedy that befalls those unforgiven spouses who have committed the egregious sin of overlooking their wedding anniversary.  Quickly, upon realizing that our founding date had passed, the Old Geezers resolved to recognize the momentous occasion with a most befitting event, an All-Comers game of the saga that started it all three years ago: Team Fortress Classic.<br><br>And so, they came by the dozens (about two-dozen, to be more precise!).  Well before game time, Geezers were found loitering on our mIRC channel, waiting to check in and bid each other "Happy Anniversary".   [OGzr] mAdmOnk is reputed to boast the record of at least six-hours prior to game time (of course, he had the UK advantage working for him!).  After catching up on old news...who had new kids, who had a new job, who had been in jail...it was off to our very own Walker Wars server, graciously administered by [OGzr] JackhOle, and loaded with all our favorite maps.<br><br>'Lo...this was no organized, disciplined practice session in the traditional Geezer vane!  While the initial rust of re-learning old moves, positions and strategies was highly evident, the skills, camaraderie and teamwork seemed to come back quickly.  By the time "Well" was loaded, Geezers seemed to be coming back into old form, with strong defenses set-up around the FR, and routinely ferocious movement of the flag once it had been dropped to the bottom.  Crossover and Shutdown2 proved to be as enjoyable as always (though the concs just didn't seem as refined)...and 2Mesa3 proved as frustrating as it was the first day we practiced on that map!  So, it was fitting that with the clock approaching midnight for our East Coast bretheren, Geezers took their leave back to mIRC to talk smack about who crowbarred and wrenched who, and to say their goodnights.<br><br>We've come a long way: from TFC, to CS...to EQ and Tribes 2 (and don't forget Gang Wars!).  It's been a hell of a ride.  We can be proud that after three years of prosperity, Old Geezers from all of our Clan's generations returned on the Anniversary to experience what makes us unique in the Gaming community: maturity, camaraderie...and our trademark canes and wheelchairs!  See you next year.<br><br><a href="http://marz.org/cgi/mmartian/ogzr/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=1&t=001050"><i>Be sure to add your comments in the forum!</i></a><br></p>

With no working knowledge of the zone or the monsters that lived there they made thier way to top of the battlement before having to evac and regroup. Thier second run netted them many failed attempts at breaking the hand room and a final resting place just south of the jail. All was going fine until a bad pull cost Drgo and Sab thier lives. Some ports were done, some rezz's were done, and it was time to go to bed for the night. <br><br>Before they left Chrac sent Sax a tell.<br>Chracner: Hey Sax wanna go turn in that item. <br>Sax: alone, can we do it. <br>Chracner: Dunno, but what the hell, we can try, I will pull them through and clear a path you get the item and port out. <br>Sax: So no port for you?<br>Chracner: Nah, I'll be alright.<br>Sax: Ok.<br><br><br>LOL, Chracner thought to himself, this guy is crazier then I am. After some great buffs by Drgo and Sab, Chrac prepared himself for what was sure to be a one way trip. Chrac turned to Sax and with out hesitating said lets go do this........Dremarian</p>

Starting off with a flourish, 57th got the first touch on the flag, and the race was on. A tough 57th Offense made the Old Ones have to backup a step and put the brakes on the flag grabs.

The 57th Defense made our cappers earn every step of our attempts to capture the flag. 57th pulled one cap, but then our D held solid, and was able to get the flag back each time it disappeared from the stand. By the time the clock ran out, the Old Geezers had again won the map, but not without a hard fight. OGzr 2-1.<br><br>Last was Drifts(x), a new map to the BEML. After making sure that everyone was ready to go, the final map started, and 57th came out charging. Flying cappers everywhere. The Defense pulled up their Depends, and held fast to the flag. Meanwhile, mortars were flying around the 57th base, and our cappers were stopped numerous times at the flag stand. The OGzr Offense stepped it up a bit, and was able to pull a few flags out of the base and back home. OGzr 4-0.<br><br>Our hats off to the 57th group.
