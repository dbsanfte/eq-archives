        <b>Round one</b>:<br>
        The Geezers were CTs, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.goonsquad.net/">(gs)</a>
        were the Ts. Pings were fairly even all around. The Goons quickly showed
        off their shooting skills, taking down Geezer after Geezer while the Old
        Ones struggled to reinforce. We quickly realized that these guys knew
        their stuff. The Geezers were able to rally for a few rounds, but the
        Goons quickly adapted and brought home the lessons. The final score was
        Goonsquad 17, Geezers 4.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Round two</b>:<br>
        Switch teams, start again. The Goon Squad quickly showed that their
        amazing marksmanship was not a fluke, and coupled with an intimate
        knowlege of the map (and great communication, it was guessed) the
        Geezers were slapped down hard. It seemed no matter where we went, there
        was a passel of Goons with guns waiting. The Geezers managed to out-wait
        the Goons on a (very) few occasions, but for the most part the day was
        theirs. Final score Goons 16, Geezers 3. A tough match for us, and very
        well played by the Goons.</td>
