        Ouch. Ride The Lightning used to be in Silver and tonight they showed us
        why. We were looking forward to playing them because we had heard about
        their new &quot;just for fun&quot; attitude, and we thought we might
        actually put up a decent showing. Oops.<br>
        <br>
        Round 1<br>
        RTL scored a very steady stream of caps, taking a commanding lead early
        and never letting up. We struggled against their D, but were finally
        able to drag out a cap. Yay, matches like this make you happy for the
        small things. Their O was very efficient, and our O never found a
        rhythm. Round 1 final: 15-195.<br>
        <br>
        Round 2<br>
        I think RTL eased up a bit on us as they didn't score nearly as much
        this round. That was nice of them. We managed to pull one flag to their
        balcony but they got it to return. Grr. We did finally get another flag
        out for a cap. Round 2 final: 10-45.<br>
        <br>
        GG RTL. I think we learned a few things.
