				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">THOSE THAT DESIRE TO POST AN APPLICATION TO JOIN INFINITE VISION ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE ONE CHARACTER LEVEL 65. WE ALSO REQUIRE FLAGS UP TO OUR CURRENT LEVEL. ASK AN OFFICER WHAT FLAGS ARE REQUIRED AT THE TIME OF YOUR APPLICATION. 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
1.	IV is primarily a raiding guild. If, for any reason, you consider raiding as a "waste of time," then you are advised to search elsewhere for a new guild
<br />
2.	IV awards loot based on a DKP merit system. We always have and always will. If you are unwilling or unable to wait your turn for loot items behind those who have earned them, go elsewhere.
<br />
3.	IV is not a loot factory: if your goal is to "get better stuff" as quickly as possible, then you are advised to go elsewhere or be patient.
<br />

<br />

<br />
A great number of IV members are "old school" players and know many people in many guilds. If you have a bad reputation from past actions or misunderstandings, it is best to bring it up immediately and explain it; otherwise, people tend to assume the worst about you. It is also surprising the number of people who apply, or ask about applying, who have bad histories with one or more of our members; if you do, you are advised to work out the problem before applying. 
<br />

<br />
We are getting more and more selective about new members. We have an abundance of some classes and lack others. Please keep this in mind when you apply for membership. An upbeat personality and a positive attitude are the most important factors for membership and always will be, but some people will find simply that they have a harder time shining among all the great members we have already. 
<br />

<br />
It is advisable to group with our members prior to applying in order to get to know them and give them the opportunity to get to know you. If you come on a raid and do not joke, chatter, play around or have fun, you won't make much of an impression, and that won't endear us to invite you into our family. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="color: yellow">APPLICATION PROCESS </span>
<br />

<br />
Post an application thread in the Membership Application section. Tell us about yourself and why you want to join Infinite Vision. 
<br />
:
<br />
Below is a guideline for application, feel free to add any other information you feel may help us get to know you and better evaluate your application. Applications will be moved to private boards within 1-2 days as long as they are filled out completely. 
<br />

<br />
Name: 
<br />
Class: 
<br />
Level: 
<br />
Pop flags: 
<br />
Epic: 
<br />
AA#: 
<br />
AA skills: 
<br />
Resist: 
<br />
Magelo (mandatory): 
<br />
Time of play: 
<br />
Reason for applying: 
<br />
Previous guilds/server
<br />

<br />

<br />
Applicants who have not attended their first raid within 30 days will have their application deleted with the assumption you are no longer interested in admittance to Infinite Vision. Exceptions to this rule will be reviewed by the Officers and dealt with on a case by case basis. 
<br />

<br />
Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact and join in experience groups with Infinite Vision members. These groupings will speed the voting process considerably. Although these groupings will not count as a raid, you should post to your raids attended with the group leader and where the group was fighting for experience. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: yellow">PROVISIONAL MEMBERSHIP </span>
<br />

<br />
If the candidate has met the above criteria, then the candidate will be invited to the guild by either the Admissions Officer or a designated Officer. He/she will have access to our guild tag, chat, and limited access to our message board. As a provisional member, they are on a 30 day probationary term. During this probationary period the new member is required to do the following: 
<br />

<br />

<br />
1.	Learn and follow guild policy. 
<br />
2.	Attend scheduled raids (if they are online). 
<br />
3.	Attend scheduled guild meetings (unless RL circumstances do not allow). 
<br />
4.	All applicants are required to attend no less than twenty guild raids before they become eligible for a guild vote for full membership. 
<br />
5.	Each applicant is required to have two Infinite Vision sponsors to speak on their behalf
<br />

<br />
It should be remembered that the initial 30 days of membership are probationary. The guild leaders have the right to remove anyone during their probation period for any reason the officers deem reasonable. Failure to meet these requirements at the end of the 30 day term is grounds for dismissal. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: yellow">THE VOTE </span>
<br />

<br />
30 days following Provisional Membership Invitation and successful completion of the above listed requirements, our recruiting officer, will create a post in our members section where members will have one week (1 week) to vote. A minimum of 40 members are required to pass with no more than 10 votes against. After the 1 week period, our recruiting officer will inform you on the outcome of the vote. 
<br />

<br />
If you do not pass the vote because you have more than 10 votes against, that usually means you have some issues to work out with a few members before being able to reapply. You will not be able to reapply for a period of 60 days. 
<br />

<br />
If you do not pass the vote because you have less than 40 sponsors *and* you have no more than 10 votes against, this usually means not enough people know you and you must continue to make friends in the guild and make yourself known to our members. You will be able to reapply in 30 days time. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: yellow">THE "MORTAL ENEMY" CLAUSE </span>
<br />

<br />
If a candidate has wronged an Infinite Vision member to the point where if that candidate were to join the current member would leave, that candidate cannot continue in the process. Infinite Vision is building our tight family atmosphere by being, well, a tight knit family. Officers will always side with the guild in these kinds of matters. It should be noted however that invocation of this clause requires an investigation into the situation between the candidate and the member, and is not to be used lightly. Abuse of this clause is against Infinite Vision policy and carries with it heavy consequences (suspension, guild removal). 
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: yellow">FULL MEMBERSHIP </span>
<br />

<br />
Full membership is granted to a new member at the end of the 30 day period provided they have met the above requirements. You now are officially part of the IV family.
<br />

<br />
FAMILY MEMBERSHIP
<br />

<br />
All members may have 1 family member added to our roster. This will be dependant upon on the current level of guild membership, and will be at the discretion of the officers.
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: yellow">RESPECT </span>
<br />

<br />
We are a family and as such arguments are inevitable. This is a fact of life and we expect this to occur from time to time. Foul language and disrespectful / rude remarks will not be tolerated in guild chat.
<br />

<br />
If you have an issue with someone take it up in tells. If someone is sending you tells that you don't want to read put that person on ignore or if they are harsh enough simply /report and let the GM handle the problem for you. These outbursts are harmful to guild morale and distractive to those of us trying to lead as well as everyone else in the guild. We all want to spend our time in game having fun. 
<br />

<br />
Playing is one thing but once it gets out of hand an officer will step in and handle the situation. Logs are required to substantiate offences.
<br />

<br />

<br />
1.	First offense: The offending person(s) will receive a warning from an officer either in tells or guild chat / raid chat. The offense will be noted in the officer forum just for tracking purposes and to alert the officers who happened to be offline of the offense.
<br />
2.	Second offense: The offending person(s) will receive a merit deduction (10-50+ points depending on the severity of the offense and at the discretion of the officer handling the situation). Officers will usually discuss this in the officer forum.
<br />
3.	Third offense: If you haven't figured it out by now that you will conduct yourself with some degree of common decency ....well, /guildremove is the next step. This also will be discussed in the officers forum and at least 2 officers will have to agree it is in the best interest of the guild to remove this player.
<br />
4.	If any offense occurs that is harsh enough to warrant immediate removal an officer will do so without the proposed forum discussion.
<br />

<br />
To put it quite simply, act like an adult. If you are mad take a deep breath and calm down before you start typing those rude or offensive remarks. They will cost you. 
<br />

<br />
The officers expect everyone in the guild to show their guild mates (all of us) at least some modicum of respect and act with some common decency so all of us can enjoy the game for the time we are logged on.
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: yellow">PUBLIC DECORUM</span>
<br />

<br />
We expect all of our members to stay away from public boards where rants and flames are concerned. 
<br />

<br />
Whereas it concerns our intra-guild business, anyone who posts regarding our inner policies or decisions will receive one warning before guild removal. Second offenses will result in immediate removal. 
<br />

<br />
If you have a problem...you post on this website. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: yellow">MAGELO</span>
<br />

<br />
We require all members to have magelo profiles linked to our DKP system. You will not be allowed to loot if this is not done. We do this so we can track progress and guide the guild to where the need is greatest. 
<br />

<br />
Go to <a href="http://www.magelo.com" target="_blank">www.magelo.com</a> and make one. If you have never done it, its not hard, its fun and you can see things like your total bonuses from items, total mana and other interesting facts about your character you cant see in game. If you have a magelo, go to DKP settings and simply enter your magelo profile number in the space provided. Our board admin can help anyone having problems doing this. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: yellow">FLAGGING</span>
<br />

<br />
We are a raiding guild first and foremost. A character must be 65 and a main to participate in a raid, unless requested by an officer to play an alt or bot a toon due to needs specific to that raid. 
<br />

<br />
Flagging Raids: No alts or bots will be allowed to attend and get flags until we have successfully done the encounter a minimum of 2 times. Minimum level for alts and bots will be 60. 
<br />

<br />
The order of priority in flagging will be: 
<br />

<br />
1.	Mains
<br />
2.	Bots: Another members main played at officers request or with officer approval
<br />
3.	Alts: Another character owned by a main
<br />
4.	Members of other guilds
<br />

<br />
A maximum of 1 alt per main will be permitted to flag. 
<br />
A maximum of 6 alts will be flagged per raid and it will be based on main's merit .
<br />

<br />
The guild will not invite for flagging any members of another guild until said guild has successfully done the encounter at least 2 times
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: yellow">MERIT SYSTEM </span>
<br />

<br />
The guild merit system is designed to allow for a fair distribution of almost all armor, weapons, items and spells (loot) acquired through large scale encounters (raids). 
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: yellow">EARNING MERIT </span>
<br />

<br />
Members accumulate merit through the participation of successful guild merit raids. Each raid or mobs within a raid earn points for members in attendance. A guild merit raid must satisfy the following requirements: 
<br />

<br />
1.	Include at least 18 characters (exceptions may be made for epic encounters) 
<br />
2.	Composed of at least 75% guild members 
<br />
3.	Incorporate attainable goals that benefit the guild or its members 
<br />
4.	No merit will be awarded for unsuccessful raids. No merit will be awarded to members who leave before the conclusion of the raid.
<br />
5.	Members may be asked by an officer to bot a character if the guild needs said character or class. Merit will be awarded to the main requested to bot and the bot since they are fulfilling a guild need.
<br />
6.	All players are responsible for checking their merit for mistakes and sending a private message to an officer that same day or not get credit for raids. Rosters will be posted at the end of each mob barring a race with another guild. If you arrive late, go LD or whatever you must ALT ENTER out and check your merit to ensure accuracy.
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: yellow">SPENDING MERIT </span>
<br />

<br />
Loot shall be awarded to members on the basis of total merit points and usability. Upon the availably of any loot item, members who can benefit from said item may request it. The member who has the highest number of merit points and can use the loot item will be awarded 
<br />

<br />
1.	A designated amount of merit points will be deducted from the members merit pool for each item awarded. 
<br />
2.	Members are eligible to receive only one major loot item per raid, unless there are no requests for an item. 
<br />
3.	Mains will pay for all items looted from their DKP pool.
<br />
4.	Items may be looted by alts if they are rotting and will cost 50% of the base charged from the Mains DKP pool.
<br />
5.	Botted characters may not loot on any given raid before mains or alts. If the bot is allowed to loot in a rot situation the merit will be deducted from the bots merit pool.
<br />
6.	Any member who misses all raids during a 7 day period will not be allowed to loot upon their return for 3 raid days during which they are required to to attend raids.
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: yellow">MERIT DEDUCTIONS</span>
<br />

<br />
1.	A deduction of 10% of the current total remaining merit per month will be made from the main account of any player who is missing in action for a period of 30 days or more.
<br />
2.	Exceptions will be made on an individual basis dependant on individual circumstances. Typically exceptions will be made for extended periods of sickness or military service.
<br />
3.	These exceptions will be at the discretion of the officers.
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: yellow">LOOT EXCEPTIONS </span>
<br />

<br />
1.	Quest pieces (e.g. tears from HoT drakes) may be awarded to the participant who is nearest to completion.
<br />
2.	Components quest keys (e.g. Trak tooth for VP) may be awarded by the officers discretion based upon availability and classes needed for a successful raid. 
<br />
3.	Particular spells and items (e.g. Greater Remove Curse) that are of a tactical use for the guild may be awarded by the officers discretion based on the betterment of the guild. 
<br />
4.	Epic components shall be awarded to the member who is nearest completion or banked until they are needed, unless the goal of the raid is to acquire specific component(s) for member(s). 
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: yellow">CLASS LOOTING PREFERENCES</span>
<br />

<br />
In general the following is true. 
<br />

<br />
1.	Bows are ranger first 
<br />
2.	Piercers are rogue first 
<br />
3.	Agro procs are warrior first 
<br />
4.	Flowing thought is casters first 
<br />
5.	Vengeance is melee first 
<br />
6.	Haste is melee first (if the haste is sufficient to merit this i.e. not 20% or something).Typically now it would have to 41% or higher 
<br />

<br />
All/All items that have great stats and some affects are going to be "classed" based on what the effects are since many items have similar stats. The effects typically decide the issue.        
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: yellow">LOOTING RESTRICTIONS</span>
<br />

<br />
1) Any member who misses all raids during a 7 day period will not be allowed to loot for 3 raid days upon their return. This means they will be allowed to loot on their fourth day back. 
<br />
2) Any member who is seen to be consistently absent or logging off for  specific mobs will receive a warning. A second occurence will result in said member not being allowed to loot for 3 raid days during which they are required to be in attendance.
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: yellow">DEGUILDING</span>
<br />

<br />
1.	The act of deguilding will result in a merit deduction of 200 points from the mains account in all cases.
<br />
2.	Automatic reinstatement will be allowed with 7 days of deguilding
<br />
3.	An absence of longer than 7 days will require reapplication and a vote by the membership. All normal rules regarding applicants will apply.
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: yellow">SWITCHING MAINS</span>
<br />

<br />
No guild, officer or member likes to see people switching mains from one to another especially after they have been geared up. However, we all do realize that people can become truly unhappy with their current main and are no longer playing them for one reason or another. If forced to keep playing the character, the guild risks loosing the person and both characters. 
<br />

<br />
Trying to come up with a consistent standard to be applied to those who choose to switch, the officers have set the following restrictions: 
<br />

<br />
1.	The new main must be level 65. 
<br />
2.	The new main must be fully flagged. (Does not apply to Sol Ro minis) 
<br />
3.	Merit transfer will be limited to 50%. Only 50% of a persons merit can be moved over to the new character. They do not loose any merit as it still remains on their old main. 
<br />
4.	Official notification of the decision to switch mains must be communicated in writing to the guild officers via the website, email, etc. before the switch.
<br />
5.	An exception to this rule will occur when a player is requested to, by the officers, and is willing to switch mains for the betterment of the guild.
<br />

<br />
Additional restrictions are being discussed concerning AA requirements, length of time between switching, looting, etc. When these are finalized they will be added to this policy and go in effect at that time. Switching mains is STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.
<br />

<br />

<br />
The above are policies and guidelines that may be subject to change should circumstances dictate. They are proposed and implemented to ensure equity and respect to all members of Infinite Vision,
<br />
