&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BIO<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Born in western plains of Karana, My parents were farmers. Well, they were living as farmers when I was a child. One day we heard news of a dragon sturring up trouble in the north. Thats when I found out my parents were once great explorers. People from the near city came to ask for help. My parents left me behind with my nanny while they went to investigate. They never returned. A messenger came with news, that till this day, I will never forget. My parents were slain by this dragon they called Lady Vox. I had no known living relatives. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So my nanny took me in. There we lived in Surefall Glades. Such a place filled with people with such high pride in a small village. I trained in the arts and skills of a druid here. These people all soon became my family. After years my life been bore. I felt the need to adventure as my parents did. See the world.... and be sure that dragons will never harm anyone AGAIN !!!<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adventures<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the deaths of my parents whom were slained by Lady Vox. Lead me to live with my nanny in Surefal glades. I trained as a druid there and when I was done, I set out to adventure. I first came upon a dungeon people called Black Barrow. These gnolls that lived here were vicious and did not like any visitors. Seeing that there were rewards for their tooths, I slained them and got my rewards. I had to make a living somehow.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I made enough to travel further, I went to the plains of Karana where I lived as a child. I had heard bandits dwel these lands. As I traveled through the western area, I ran into A man named Saredar. A warrior willing to defend rightousness. We defeated many bandits and the creatures that roamed the area. We made some good money by turning in the sashes off these bandits. I felt I had to move on and see more of Norrath.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rumors of a continent called Kunark was about. This place sounded exciting. So I packed my bags and headed out to this place. I came upon a lake. It was known as Lake of Ill Omens. Wow, was this place filled with people. Creatures named Sarnarks had over populated here. The near outpost known as Firona Ve was having trouble getting scouts through here. These were aggresive creatures so I had to fight them to help this great outpost.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I was here, I ran into 3 fellow adventurers. Yazaru, a handsome charming dark elf. Hike, A proud dorf whom sworn to protect me. And Teca, a powerful and crazy high elf. They were members of the Dragons Revolt. I admired them so, for heroes they have become. I joined them in their cause for Dragons too, have slained my parents.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the mountains near by, stood giants whom were very nasty. Intruders were killed and eaten. I could not stand it and help fight them off. They had these magical earings that I loved. I did happen to come by a pair which help me in my adventures trememdously.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yazaru told me of troubles from the outpost where he came from. He warned me that I was not welcomed there by the natives but he can use my help. So I went to help him slain Sarnarks and got braids from them. He needed those to turn in as proof of loyalty to the outpost.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We went to the Dreadlands in search of treasure. There was a castle in those lands. People referred it to as Karnor's Castle. We hunted outside of that castle for many years. Killing Drolvargs and other creatures in the area. Here, I met more friends and more family members.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had grown to love these Dragons Revolt. For a family they were. My family now. I spent many adventures with our family.<br>
<br>

Oh mighty Karana! God of Rain!<br>
Please don't let Dalila be slain!</font>
