              the guild.</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">Within the guild,
              racial and religious conflicts will NOT occur. Thou are dedicated
              to eradicating the dragon threat, not enforcing our beliefs on
              Norrath.</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">We will honor all
              alliances. Treat our allies as guild members.</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">As a group, we seek
              to assist each other in any way we can, be it the passing
              heal/buff spell to aid our fellow friends, or
              trading/manufacturing items for guild members. By banding together
              we can increase our strength and our numbers until we are a force
              to be reckoned with.</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">Members of Dragons
              Revolt will not use the /anonymous mode. If you feel you need to
              go anonymous, you may use /roleplay mode. We will wear the Dragons
              Revolt banner over our heads proudly.</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">A member who receives
              a complaint regarding their poor behavior will be investigated.
              Depending on the seriousness of the offense, the first offense
              will be a warning, a second will cause removal from the guild.</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">If you are in a
              confronting situation, use /log to record the events. Send an
              email to the appropriate officer, with a copy to the guild leader,
              to resolve the dispute. If the dispute is with members outside our
              guild, invite them to the dispute section of the message board to
              discuss resolution. Without a /log file, disputes will be resolved
              at the guild officer's discretion. Dueling may be used in these
              circumstances. Remember that you represent not only yourself but
              your guild.</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">The true purpose of
              the Dragons Revolt is to have fun for us and everyone around us.</font></li>
