<br>
Some of you might wonder why we havent had an ezboard for the last few days well Im going to enlighten you all.<br>
<br>
We havent had an ezboard for the last few days because of the dishonorable actions of one person, Cerasmuerto. <br>
<br>
I know you are saying to yourself right now "What the hell is Hawke talking about Ceras would never do something like tha he is to honorable." Well in answer to your question let me say this bullshit. <br>
<br>
The other night Ceras, under the guise of our old ezop (that is the person who founded the board in this case Aernn/Zantes) came on to our boards and messed with them. He systematically moved members who were adminstrators on the board back to member status (so that we couldnt fix what he did) and then proceeded to hide our board from us. You might ask how this could happen well back when Aernn left our guild he honorably turned over the passcodes to Ceras who in what I consider a vile and dishonorable thing he went and took away a board from an entire guilds membership. And for what reason, there is no good reason to hurt an entire guild he may not agree with me but there is no reason to take it out on everyone who didnt follow him blindly elsewhere. <br>
<br>
You may be saying to yourself right now this is all very well in theory and makes a good story but where is your proof. Well my friends the proof is in the following two links.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://ezboard.supportclient.com/tickets.php?ticket=4584676E0aba" target="_new">ezboard.supportclient.com/tickets.php?ticket=4584676E0aba</a><br>
http://ezboard.supportclient.com/tickets.php?ticket=4584676E0aba<br>
<a href="http://ezboard.supportclient.com/tickets.php?ticket=459822B7714F" target="_new">ezboard.supportclient.com/tickets.php?ticket=459822B7714F</a><br>
http://ezboard.supportclient.com/tickets.php?ticket=459822B7714F<br>
<br>
If those links to the ezboard support site dont work I have cut and pasted the messages down to the bottom of this post in order.<br>
<br>
Now Im going to stop being nice and forgiving right here. HOW DARE YOU CERAS, how dare you come into our home and do this, what gave you the right to do that to another guild. You talk constantly about honor and integrity, I now believe that you know nothing of those concepts and that you should be ashamed of yourself for besmirching those concepts with your taint. My God if we look at the front page of your website <a href="http://www.honorwithin.com" target="_new">www.honorwithin.com</a> you have just made your own Three Tenets of honor out to be a joke. You have been posting barbed comments on this board and others about myself and the guild since you left. We all tried to rise above it and not get sucked into it with you, Buddar slipped but I also know he apologized to you for that slip and that happened awhile before you did this to our site. I personally have let you be, I havent said anything to you or gone to YOUR website and posted anything trying to put all this behind me but you just couldnt let it go could you. You have just gone and permenantly damaged your own rep by your own hand. There was no justification for this no amount of BS you can put into this is going to make it better or make you look like a good person. If anyone believes that this act makes you honorable and full of integrity I weep for them. I feel sorry for you and those who followed you, you not only tainted yourself with this act but them as well. And for what? Nothing this is a damm game that you have let get into your head I think it is time for you to retire and take up checkers or paper airplane modeling something a lot less stressful. <br>
<br>
I have had my say I cannot tell you how angry you made me and a lot of other people, people who I am sure want to have their say about this as well. <br>
<br>
Goodbye Ceras I called you friend and believed in you at one point but not anymore. You sir are not welcome on our boards or anything else we do.<br>

The board is exactly the same, no forums have been deleted. They are invisible forums and cerasmuerto took you off the allowed users list so it looks like there are no forums, but they are all still there. I gave aernn back the account today, gave him the password, changed the account's email and secret question. It's up to him now, all he has to do is add people back into the allowed users lists. By the way he admits he GAVE the aernn account to cerasmuerto, but then he changed his mind after cerasmuerto closed down the boardd. So there really was no hacking involved, just bad judgement on who to give the board to.<br>
<br>
If there is anything else you need help with, please let me know.<br>

When does our board come back up? <br>
  <br>
ezboard Support [EzStaff - Helpdesk Representative] July 19, 2003 16:31:20 <br>
 <br>
Cerasmuerto claims the original Aernn gave the account away to cerasmuerto. Cerasmuerto provided an email from Aernn that gave him the password, the secret question and answer, etc. Only Aernn would have known those things and he gave it all to cerasmuerto. <br>
<br>
But I also got a ticket from aernn saying he was hacked. I am trying to investigate, but thank you got getting aernn to file a ticket because I almost gave the account back to Cerasmuerto when he provided the secret answer.<br>
<br>
I hope this is cleared up soon.. If there is anything else you need help with, please let me know.<br>
sincerely, helpdesk representative <br>

Thank you very much, this is very helpful. May I ask how long this ticket will stay up for viewing so we have proof? <br>
  <br>
ezboard Support [EzStaff - Helpdesk Representative] July 17, 2003 20:56:28 <br>
 <br>
Yes it does match. That user has a very LONG list of IPs,, but the one IP that was used today to revoke your mod powers and to remove everyone from private forums is one of the IPs on that long list. It resolves to sprint.<br>
<br>
We are sorry for the inconvenience. If there is anything else you need help with, please let me know.<br>
sincerely, helpdesk representative <br>
  <br>
Customer [Chris Demetreon] July 17, 2003 11:56:06 <br>
We have a hunch who did this. Can you check if the new IP address that logged in is the same as an old member ID called cerasmuerto please? <br>
  <br>
ezboard Support [EzStaff - Helpdesk Representative] July 17, 2003 11:58:31 <br>
 <br>
I see the ezop aernn today has revoked all other admin's powers, and removed private forum access from everyone. The IP used to do this is not the same as the IPs used by that ezop previously. I will lock down the ezop account for now, then the true owner of the account needs to contact us to get the account back. It looks like no topics or forums were deleted so I don't think a restoral is needed.<br>
If you are friendly with aernn, can you please have him open a ticket and get in contact with us to take his account back?<br>
<br>
If there is anything else you need help with, please let me know.<br>

I will also change the secret question for you, since Cerasmuerto knows the current secret question he could just take it back at any time.<br>
To prove you are the original owner, please provide the state and zip code you gave when you registered.<br>

But what needs to be restored? Nothing was deleted.<br>
<br>
Cerasmuerto did revoke all the other admin's powers and removed everyone from the private forum. He admits doing this. The only question is, did he hack your account or did you give it to him? Because if you gave it to him, then he really can do what he wants with it. Once you give the account away, you no longer call the shots. If you gave it to him, then only he can request a restoral as the rightful board owner. If he hacked you, Then I can give you the account back and we can restore you although nothing was deleted today.<br>
Please let me know which it is.<br>
<br>
If there is anything else you need help with, please let me know.<br>
sincerely, helpdesk representative <br>
  <br>
Customer [AJ Walike] July 18, 2003 00:00:22 <br>
Yes I did give it to him. I had "retired" from that board and someone I trusted needed to have power. Cerasmuerto wouldn't have changed anything without reason, he's not that kind of person. A restoral would be nice. Let me know. <br>
  <br>
ezboard Support [EzStaff - Helpdesk Representative] July 18, 2003 00:00:40 <br>
 <br>
The user cerasmuerto claims you gave him the aernn account and has an email from you where you gave him the password, secret question, etc. Is that not true? If you didn't give him the info, how did he know your secret question and answer?<br>
I'm going to leave the account banned until I can clear this up, and if you were hacked I will change your secret question for you because the other guy knows it and all your registration info.<br>
I don't see the log listing any posts or forums being deleted. All of the actions done by the aernn account on July 17 are revoking other admin's powers and removing people from private forums. We can do a restoral but I don't see anything being deleted. Do you need a restoral?<br>
<br>
We are sorry for the inconvenience. If there is anything else you need help with, please let me know.<br>

Hacked ezboard.<br>
<br>
I am the ezop of the http://pub48.ezboard.com/bdivineglory board and my account was hacked. I would like my account reactivated with a new password. Refer to the URL in the specific URL of Posts section for details. Also, would it be possible to restore all the forums and posts that were deleted?<br>

IMO It would have been better to simply say &quot;We're sorry for the inconvience the MB not being up has caused but it is back now and should be fully operational.

<br>
I first want to state that I have no issues with anyone in the guild, and still have quite a few friends in here, so please do not take my post as being anything but what I state in it. I left DG to stay with my hubby, Orolin, and to do what I felt was best for me. Thus being said, here are my thoughts.<br>
<br>
 When I saw what Hawk had posted, I was concerned, and wanted to find out from the &quot;horse's mouth&quot; so to speak, before I posted my thoughts on the matter. I know that with feelings being high and aroused greatly, that what I say may not be believed, but I know the man behind the toon and I believe him. Being in grad school for counseling and only having 1 year to go has given me lots of knowledge about people, and I feel that what I am going to say is the God's honest truth. I have also been involved in many conflict resolutions and I hope that I can do some good here. I hope that anyone who reads this will, if nothing else, think about what I am writing, regardless of what they may be feeling or thinking inside, and try to give it a chance. Beyond that I can only pray that all will have peace with each other so that our playing time can be pleasant and fun as it has been.<br>
<br>
As you know, Ceras has had some frustrations and so forth, (to be said lightly and plainly). And at the risk of causing more of a stir, I tell you the following information, but I believe that both sides need to be heard, and I want to say what I know. When I asked Cerasmuerto what had happened, he said that he had not done what this forum has stated, however, he knows who did. Ceras stated that his daughter was upset with what has happened in the past, and that while he was in the hospital having surgery last week, she had gotten on his computer onto his account without him knowing it, and changed the admin rights. He only found out about it later when the board was &quot;down&quot;. She admitted to changing it because she felt loyalty to him and was upset. He knows that now this means the impossible task of trying to straighten it out, and in my conversation with him, he seemed to feel  as though even if he told his side that no one would believe him anyways. Ceras took himself off of admin rights right after he left and also cannot see the board, so I am taking the risk of posting this without his knowledge. <br>
<br>
He DID NOT ask me to post my thoughts. I wanted to post in order to help relieve the confusion a little. I realize that his daughter shouldn't have done what she did, and Ceras shared the same sentiment with me. The problem now is how the aftermath will be handled. She made a mistake, but Ceras did not do what everyone thought to be a malicious act on his part. He did not tell his daughter to do it, nor did he want anything to happen to the guild board. I truly believe in my heart that Divine Glory has every right to be upset, however, I also believe in my heart that Ceras is not the horrible person that he has been made out to be from this incident. Ceras is still a kindhearted, compassionate person. He is still the same Grandpa that everyone knows and loves, still the same person who has traditions fo the heart and mind, and I only hope that those who read this will hear me out and try to understand how this may have gotten out of control. <br>
<br>
Please, for everyone's sakes, let's try to have peace. I am still friends with all of you, and want our families to get along always. I wish you all well, and I hope and pray that I was eloquent enough to make sense in my writing. <br>
<br>
Thank you all for letting me post this. I appreciate the respect and honor you have all given me and my hubby, Orolin.<br>
See you all in the game,<br>
<br>

Everyone please read.*****</span><hr size=1> Thank you Morgyn for your point of view.  I come from a medical background and have dealt with many people that present to the hospital with mental or behavioral problems.  This is not an instance of crisis intervention, this is an instance of a man who has lost touch.  The question I have for you Morgyn is that if it was not Ceras, then why the following responses, and I do quote from the tickets posted above.<br>
<br>
QUOTE***Cerasmuerto did revoke all the other admin's powers and removed everyone from the private forum. He admits doing this ****QUOTE<br>
<br>
QUOTE***Cerasmuerto claims the original Aernn gave the account away to cerasmuerto. Cerasmuerto provided an email from Aernn that gave him the password, the secret question and answer, etc. Only Aernn would have known those things and he gave it all to cerasmuerto. ***QUOTE<br>
<br>
Ceras HIMSELF admitted to doing this.  It is pathetic to put the blame on a child, she must be, what? a teenager? Only a child would have the mentality to &quot;throw a tantrum and break things&quot; so to speak.  How would his daughter have known where to access the admin area, know where she needed to go and what she needed to do to disable our board? She must be pretty savvy to be able to navigate the admin side and systematically remove all other admin's powers, and remove private forum access from everyone?  <br>
<br>
You can continue to blindly stand behind him and continue to protect, honor and believe in his good name, more power to you.  Many people have now had their eyes open to a small portion of all that he has done.  All I have to say is that I have NO respect for a man who knows not the meaning of the words honor and integrity and can stoop to the levels that he has.  It is time that he become a man and face what he did with what little honor and dignity he has left and take the consequences instead of continuing to hide behind pathetic excuses.  <br>
<br>
Finally, this is a game that we play to enjoy ourselves and make an escape from the realities of the world for a brief time.  It is my hope that I can continue to enjoy this game and that Ceras has learned to leave well enough alone. <br>

<br>
Having read your statement I have one question.<br>
<br>
How is it possible that Ceras daughter had access to Aernns account?  I mean that is the account that got used to change our boards not Ceras.  The account passcodes were given to Ceras from Aernn awhile ago and from what I can see they werent even in use until we had to fix the board.  Now unless you are telling me that Ceras had Aernns account loaded in his ezboard management setup instead of his own ezboard name (which I can see no reason for as the account hasnt been used in some time) there is no way she could have known what the passwords were for our site.  Nor would she have know that Aernn was our ezop because as you stated Ceras had taken himself off as adminstrator to our site so it wouldnt have been to easy to see who was what.  And this all from a teenage girl who hasnt even been playing in EQ on her account for the last 4 months or so.  Because Ceras gave Rhyna the character that was set up for his daughter to use as the guild banker and that was who was using it.  I have been a professional investigator for the last 8 years and this has holes in it as big as Buicks this is like saying I didnt do my homework because the dog ate it.  I want this situation to end Im not happy about what was done and neither are a lot of other people but unless you can fill those holes Im going to stick with this.  In all fairness it could have been his daughter but that is just stretching the realm of reality a bit far.  If you convince me otherwise I will believe that it was his daughter.<br>

Ceras is an old guy.  It is quite possible that he has a teenage daughter, however, I've known him for about a year and never heard of a daughter at home.<br>

<br>
I understand where the skeptisicm (sp?)and anger are coming from. However, I imagine with all ceras has to remember, my guess is that he could have had it posted on his computer with all his other passwords, I do this myself with all the passwords I have for my million accounts on my computer. His daughter is not a teenager, and knows her way around a computer. She is in college as well and is home for the summer. <br>
<br>
When Orolin had an ez board account, I helped him manage it. I did not find it hard to figure out how to manage everything while he was at work, and I imagine Ceras' daughter is smart as well. As far as Ceras admitting it himself, the admin staff was talking to the name, not the person himself. His daughter was representing &quot;Ceras&quot;. I am assuming that once Ceras found out and realized what had happened, he tried to fix it as best he could by not making things more complicated by telling his side to the admin staff so the board could be restored quickly. <br>
<br>
Like I said, I understand both sides, and no, I do not see this as a crisis intervention, Ladiana, but something I saw both sides on and thought I could shed some light on the situation. I cannot say more than what is already there in my earlier post. I want to thank you for hearing me out, I do appreciate it, and wish you all well and safe in your travels.<br>
<br>
Peace and friendship always,<br>

<br>
I have to believe, based upon what I once thought of him, that Ceras' own conscience will do a much better job.<br>
<br>
I sent an e-mail to Ceras asking what had happened. I have not yet, to my knowledge, recieved a response. <br>
<br>
Daughter or not, the man should step up and offer his own public apology and explanation, be it on these boards, or the public section of the Honor Within boards.. Until that happens, I will not support or contact any persons that defend his actions.<br>

<br>
The account that was used to remove the admin rights and change passwords and remove members, etc from this board was NOT Ceras's account.  It was someone else's account that held ownership to the board.  Are you going to come back and explain how you said one thing and now mean another?<br>
<br>
You better get your story straight with Ceras before you post any more.  Because all you are doing is making yourself look foolish.  Ceras needs to be a man and face this on his own.  Stop making excuses for him.  <br>
<br>
As McMad has said, I will have nothing to do with anyone asscociated with him, because it is a joke to display a guild tag of Honor Within when the crux of the guild has none. <br>

Have you seen the E-mail that he sent to my house that had chat log cut and paste to make Bearenmore look bad? He then lied and said that the sentences' did it all by them selves. What the @#%$ do I look like? That was when I first realized Ceras to be a little liar and lost respect for him.<br>
 Then...just before he left our guild...did you ever hear the comment's that he would make? I don't remember the comment's now as they weren't worth it, but it does affect the way people see a person. <br>
And then after he left...the jab's and the barbed comment's...I mean come on...pull your head out...Ceras is a very bitter and resentful person. Ok...even if he didn't do it...and believe in my heart that he did it and he's come up with a pathetic excuse to blame it on.... he still lost respect by posting the stuff that he would post.... just because you go in and edit and remove what you post, it still show's the child like behavior.... does he blame all of that on his daughter as well? <br>
His ego was hurt when Hawk told him to back off and quit saying your guild leader,or what ever it was that Hawk told him. He tried to save face and made another guild...and just to let everyone know in &quot;Honor Within&quot; your guild name is just a jab at Divine Glory...if it isn't...well that's how it seem's. Ceras would do something like that.<br>
 Even after he made the new guild and recruited from our rank's, he would still post on our board...It is mine and other's belief that that was to try to recreate discontent and recruit yet more of our rank's..and I applaud Ceras because it worked....look at who you took and brain washed...and that's what I believe everyone in Honor Within to be ...brain washed.<br>
<br>
If you read this far...that's how I feel and what I see.<br>
<br>
I will not associate with Honor Within again.<br>

<br>
The people involved know what theyve done and shouldve done.  This is true on all sides.  <br>
<br>
The people that followed Ceras, followed a friend that they have had and continue to have faith in.<br>
<br>
This current situation had to be handled publicly to keep it from happening again.  Past that, I will make this point very very clear.<br>
<br>
This situation sits squarely in the lap of the responsible parties.  God help them for this.  This situation IS NOT going to be extrapolated out to reflect upon every person that went with Ceras or continues to support him.  I will not log into this board in any evening and see this turn into a for/against story.  Morgyn has posted it as she understands it.  Agree or dont.  I personally dont, but Morgyn is also my friend.<br>
<br>
I do think that the person that needed to speak here hasnt and that is the only person I would wish to talk about this incident.<br>
<br>
It is thru his computer information, either directly or indirectly, that this has happened.  The man I knew would be loath about this.  I hope that is still the case.<br>

I do understand that problems must be resolved and involved parties must talk through their differences. However, considering that Ceras has informed me that he absolutely refuses to come to the DG message board for any reason, it seems that all involved parties have spoken. I absolutely refuse to log in and find people I've come to know and respect acting in such a way.<br>

Everyone please read.*****</span><hr size=1> Ceras owes DG an apology. <br>
<br>
His actions thus far reinforce the belief that he is the responsible party.<br>
<br>
Honor Within has a public section on thier message boards. Ceras can post his thoughts/explanation there. He should step up and act like a man. Take the bullet and post his own explanation instead of having guildies clumsily try to defend him without full knowledge of the situation.<br>
<br>
I really expected Ceras to have the Honor to put forth an apology. I really did. I had a great deal of respect for him but, the fact that he dodges his responsibilities to DG in this matter, says volumes about the true figure behind the toon.<br>
<br>
It would have been incredibly easy for Ceras to come here, or to post on Honor Within's public section, his version of what had happened and an apology. He has refused.<br>
<br>
Until Ceras makes that effort, I will assume that I greatly misjudged what I thought was a friendly, caring, mature individual. <br>
<br>
It's easy for Ceras to address this issue and rectify it with most of us. I don't want to crucify him, I want to see him stand up like a man. It's what I would do.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://pages.prodigy.net/asaintone/mad1.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:xx-small;"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub48.ezboard.com/bdivineglory">Divine Glory</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> | <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:xx-small;"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=216142">Magelo Profile</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

I caution everyone that reads this to remember that we have friends in both guilds.  No one has turned into the devil.  While this started with a misunderstanding, these things take on a life of their own, and misery begets misery.<br>
<br>
We need to look to the future and put this unfortunate thing behind us.  <br>

May fortune shine on your journeys through Norrath, my friends.<br>
