I thought I would post this so you could learn some of the finer points of grouping and soloing. <br>
<br>
1)  Mage's have the hardest time getting groups, few people aside from other mage's know how powerful we are.  Our pets have several K hp and hit in the 50's, our nukes aren't as good as Wizards but can come fairly close, and we get the best AE spells aside from Druids, maybe.  Groups don't know this so if you see people shouting for group members send tells asap trying to get in cause you can spend an hour and a half sometimes shouting for a group and never get one<br>
<br>
2)  Grouping rules:  Always keep control over your pet, one of the worst things that can happen to a group, and one of the main reasons people don't want mage's is because their afriad we wont be able to control our pet and he will start breaking mez or attacking the wrong mob or something.  Don't send you pet in until the warrior has agro and remember to USE YOUR ASSIT KEY!  warriors get very angry when they have to keep bailing the mage out of trouble cause their pet wont stop attacking the wrong mob.  Remember your pets agro is the same thing as your agro so when you cast your adding to the agro and its easy for the mob to want to attack you.  <br>
<br>
3)  If you can't get a group, go soloing, there are plenty of spots to solo at.  BW, DL, KC entrance (just be careful of trains), and other such spots.  just watch your pets hp and the enemy mobs, if the mob seems to be doing better than the pet nuke once or twice then sit back down; away from the mob cause you wil have some majorly bad agro for a few moments.  Also its best to use the air pet if your soloing,  It has lots of agi and will take less dmg, its stun spell is very useful too.  Earth has most hp but no agi and will take max dmg from hits almost every time.  and use your Dmg shield!  It can really add up in a fight!  If your soloing you should also use your bolt nukes since they have great range, and have a SoW potion or two on hand, unless you have Jboots; just incase something goes wrong.  <br>
<br>
4)  The fastest exp, if you want to know, is with one a druid or bard; perhaps enchanter, as a partner.  That way your pet wont take half the exp and you get max exp from group.  I teamed up with Isay in BW and got mad exp from it.  When soloing against the same mobs I got less cause of the exp my pet took.  Mage's are probably one of the best soloing partners in EQ, mainly because you have a tank/nuker/AEer/manamachine with several other things rolled into one class.  If we had fear and snare we'd be unbeatable!  Its best to stay in places where you have a place to run if something goes wrong, places like BW and DL where you have several zones close by are the best, then if something goes wrong you can have a place to run too, I don't suggest dungeons since its so easy to get adds which you might not be prepared to deal with.  <br>
<br>
5)  Use your buffs to best effect, the armor bufs add a very nice regen for hp, and a minimal mana effect, it can mean a lot when your injured and running around trying to get away from a mob to get your hp back faster.  Also use your Hp buffs, they can save your life, I know they've saved mine!<br>
<br>
6)  Watch your mana as much as possible, cause if you pull something while soloing and are lom your probably dead unless the mob is weak, and never make the mistake of under estimating your enemy, they can surprise you!<br>
<br>
I hope this helps you somewhat, and if your can do as I can and make your pet jump through hoops your a good mage!  Hope you guys can add something to this and make it an even better Post<br>

Dont forget that a mage can make an addition to an AE group, since their AE spells are the second best in the game. I dont know if they get any Point Blank AE spells after lvl 50 though, I need to check this up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And dont take the Mage cannot get a group perspective to harsh, a lot of classes feel this way and all the class based boards says the same for their own class. The classes in EQ that do have problems getting groups in the late 50 game are Necromancers, Mages, Wizards and possibly Paladins and Shadowknights. I dont know if Beastlords will be added to the list yet, time will show us I suppose.<br>
<br>
IMHO mages rocks in groups as long as camp spot aint moving to much, its hard to move that pet in large areas especially indoors. If Celtharion joins our group we seldom need an enchanter or bard for Crowd control, his pets and another casters root spell takes care of any adds. Earth pets are great for saving time to get the main target mob killed.<br>

I slow mob(it aggros me), pull it away from others, or mob always strike a PC instead of pet. After about 10 seconds of pet hitting mob it has aggro and i can backaway.<br>
<br>
If needed ill just heal pet with Torpor, cost less than recasting broken roots all time.<br>
<br>
Also we got the new pet superior heal for mages, and thats really good. All other mage pet heals are a disgrace.<br>
<br>
And, why we rather heal then make a new pet...  Love buffing that monster Earthpets hp even more <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Even if Bolts suck because of the need for a clear path to the target. The added range and delayed effect of a bolt is very much a cool thing. <br>
In short I miss the bolt spells I had on the lower lvls (last one on lvl 25 I belive)<br>
<br>
I remember very much when I was on my last Kael raid.<br>
I think we had every highlvl mage in the guild on that raid.<br>
<br>
I was roaring jelouse of your bolt spell. Watching those Giants getting 3 bolts in an all out attack from 3 magicians at the same time just looked so darn cool.<br>

When I cast a little fizzle happens around the mob.<br>

In most cases, with an exception or two, (like between 34-39 when mages have Cinder Bolt, which beats the wizard best 34-39 nuke which is not a bolt), if you take a wizard and a magician and compare their ability to deal damage, wizards can do more damage faster, and use less mana doing it.  Includling area effect damage.  <br>
<br>
As far as getting groups goes, yes I agree that it can be a pain sometimes, but this is for all classes.  Even clerics and enchanters sometimes have to beg for long amounts of time to get a group, it just depends on what is needed in the area at the time.  Smart people looking for extra damage who already have the essenstials will not hesitate to add a LFG mage to group, and that leads me to my next magician opinion.<br>
<br>
Mages rock, if you ask me.  I have had lots of my conjuring colleagues ask me if I get as irate about mages &quot;sucking&quot; or being &quot;nerfed&quot; too much.  I don't see this as the case, I tell them, I see mages as not only a fully viable class on EQ, but a kick ass one at that.  I never have understood why some magicians complain, or any class for that matter.  Every single class in the game can be extremely useful and kickass, it just depends on how well the person sitting at the computer knows how to play their character to the fullest.  People who shout things like &quot;rangers suck&quot; and &quot;paladins blow&quot; (and are serious about it and not joking) are simply ignorant newbies, the way I see it.  Anyone who thinks those two classes suck, or for that matter thinks any class or race sucks, just plain doesn't know what is going on.  And yes, I have my set of gripes about Everquest, but as far as any class or race &quot;sucking&quot; argument, I totally disagree.  Most of my gripes have to do with the stupid little rules they make that seem to do nothing more than annoy and waste time =).   But anyway, there's my two coppa. <p>Kjata Holythunder<BR>Battlemage<BR>"You bastards!  You killed Kebarn!"

Groups just don't know how powerful mage's are, probably because they have never played a mage or seen a good mage being played.  I have saved my groups several times when we had our healer or chanter agrooed and I sent my pet in to take agro off for a moment or two so the mob could be rezzed or just let sit there and beat on the mob forever hehe.  And if you really want to argue it, Mage's out damage wizzy's in dmg flat down cause of pets, we cast char for 670dmg and have a fire pet sitting next to use casting three times for 200 each hehe, and the pet never runs out of mana muhahahahaha beat that wizzy's!

<br>
some points that Every class should know....<br>
<br>
1) Every class has their levels in which they are not the most useful to a group...for some classes however the level range is small and perhaps low level...for instance, at low level 12 or so a druid or shaman can be as effective as a cleric, in some cases a shaman is prefered since it has sow at level 9.  Mages fall into this range for awhile, level 29 to 50+ however, this is when their soloing might comes to its true power (if done right).  At level 50 i soloed a 100 percent MR level 50 guard in the karana's, soloed ice giants down going to vox's priest, and almost had the PoD.<br>
<br>
2)  The main reason for mages getting a bad rap, and i'm sure people will hate me for this, i've seen really good mages and i've seen really crappy mages....not implying anything about the people in this guild...i've just never seen a so/so mage.<br>
<br>
Tips to being The Mage:<br>
<br>
1) Know your spell book, no matter how you organize it, know what spells are in what slot....this is easy for the most used spells, but sometimes its the least used spells that are needed FAST.<br>
<br>
2)  Know your pets, sit down and calculate the average damage and hp of each pet, as well as the rate at which they are hit...sometimes earth pet is not the prefered on low mana.<br>
<br>
3)  Wizards out nuke us...but in the long run a mage can do more damage than a wizard any day of the week....wizards will argue, but i've fought a fight for 10 minutes and ended with 20 percent mana.  I'll let you figure that out =o)  BTW this was at level 50 and i had crappy gear =o)<br>
<br>
4)  Don't get hung up on Necro's do this, Druids do this, Wizard do this...where do mages fit in?  Bend the rules...make due with that you have.  Sounds hard, but the mages, if played well, are a VERY prefered class.<br>
<br>
5)  Enchanters won't fear you if your good....Ask any enchanter what is their worst fear....10 to 1 they say a pet, or a newbie who's bought a level 60 melee.  You CAN use your pet both to play crowd control, AND you CAN pull a pet consistantly off of a mes....cuspid has seen me do this in hate against a mob that wasn't slowed...consistantly....practice this, if you can do this mages you are the prefered damage dealing caster hands down.<br>
<br>
Other tips:<br>
<br>
Get those HP up!  not sure what going rate for level 55 mage hp are, but syden had near 1700hp self buffed....i could literally nuke hard, stand in there to get mobs off cleric, or enchanter, have my pet on it and live.<br>
<br>
Mod rods...a chanter gets low on mana, startmodulating them...common sense i know, but VERY few people ever do this in the middle of a fight....you can nuke your heart out, but if the cleric or enchanter dies you fooked...save some mana for mod rods 25 percent is what i used to use as my soft cap.<br>
<br>
Train the pet!<br>
<br>
This is where you become the most valuable...Cleric oom, enchanter oom, tanks and melee 25 percent health...one mob full hp...you can literally take care of it for 10 minutes as long as its one mob...2 mages you can prolly take care of 4mobs at a time.  (My record with Ropise is 14 mob train in KC taken out by 2 mages...no healers).  <br>
<br>
Cast pet, send pet in.<br>
<br>
watch pet's health, monitor rate it is going down<br>
start casting pet (10 seconds or so-seems like forever)<br>
hit enter<br>
type in:  /pet get lost<br>
wait til you are half a bub of casting time left<br>
hit enter<br>
use hot key to send new pet in on old target (prefered to use earth pet for this in most cases)<br>
<br>
<br>
if you have 2 or 3 mages doing this, its a joke, you can literally med 95 percent of the casting cost for that pet back by the time you need to summon another one...at 5 percent mana loss per pet you are looking at 20 pets by the time you have to book that zone, thats also dependent on if you have a mod rod somewhere on you before the fight.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm sure most of you guys knew this, but for some non mage players, this might open the world of tactics up for the guild...considering the amount of mages we have in the guild now...level 60 mob will summon if a mage sits down too long, however standing up chances are it will leave you alone...great way to start a figth too...send the pets in mages stand, let the mob get his HT's and dots down, waste his mana on the pets, send in MT (clerics now still have full mana) tank goes in and the pets and mages are now above agro range than the cleric who needs to heal him....its VERY risky for mages and havn't played like this for Luclin...but it works in Kunark for sure.<br>

Warrior had resonable resists, along with the inate magic resist warriors get. Once i landed Malosini the fire pets nuke hit for 176 almost every time. <br>
I havent tested it with the new fire pet, but it acts weird anyway. <br>
As far as i have noticed there are atleast 4 types of fire pets you can summon.<br>
<br>
1)Chain rooter, this pet will cast root everytime it casts a spell<br>
<br>
2)Rooter and stunner, this pet will cast root and stun often<br>
<br>
3)Chain stunner, this pet is a mean stunner. With malosini on mob it can almost perma-stun a mob. 3 of these mofos will keep the mob frozen for the entire fight.<br>
<br>
4)Wizard, this pet will root, stun, nuke, dispell and do whatever else a wizard can do.<br>
