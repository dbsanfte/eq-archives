<br>
My Father, a strong warrior named Dorious and my mother a wonderful woman named Sornum passed the long winter days by hunting mammoth calves and slaying orc's and goblins when the situations called for it. They had a deep love for one another and had plenty of time together to talk of the daily routine's of hunting for food, keeping the Orc's at bay, and fending off the Goblin's that alway's seemed to be near.<br>
Dorious's sence of humor always made Sornum laugh, even when they where being chaced by skeleton's he would crack a joke about how easily they would be caught if the skellies had any meat on thier bones to keep up.<br>
<br>
These where the day's single men drempt about. To have a woman that was so gorgeous, eloquent, and could cook the best of meals from what seemed like nothing....he was truely blessed.<br>
<br>
Then when Dorious thought he could not be happier, Sornum told him she was expecting a child....... He was so happy. He had dream's of being able to teach his child the way's of the Northman.. <br>
<br>
Many month's later Sornum gave berth to a healthy baby boy. Dorious named him Shamer, after the shame he knew the big baby boy would put to his foe's.<br>
<br>
Shamer grew up slow, spending his early years with his mother helping with the meal's and learning about the herb's, root's and flower's of the area. He loved to create mixture's to help cure minor ache's and pain's, and would put that extra flavor into a sometime's tough puma meat.<br>
<br>
Then one day his whole life would be turned upside down. His Mother and Father went out to take down a mammoth calf seen wandering away from it's mother. Sornum would distract the beast while Dorious would come in from the side and hope for a well landed slash to the neck. An easy kill, they would have food for at least a week. When they began to come upon the unwerry calf they were jumped by Redwing and his fiendish orc henchmen. Dorious screamed at Sornum to run as fast as she could to get Bandll the warrior seen in the area prior to their hunt. Dorious take's a blade across his leg from an orc and is slammed by a direct damage spell from Redwing. He regains his sence's quickly as he know's he must hold them off as long as he can for his wife to have any chance of making it back to Bandll. He reaches deeply inside his soul and summon's the stength and fury to face the overwhelming number's. He count's 4 henchmen and the towering Redwing. <br>
Maimed from the slash to the leg and unable to run, Dorious hold's his ground fending off blows and landing a couple of his own. He land's a crippling blow to an Orc's neck and render's the brut lifeless. Another Orc take's off after Sornum to halt her persuit of a savior. Dorious see's this and tries to stop the Orc and get's another blast in the back from Redwing for offering his backside as such an easy target. He fall's to the ground paralized in pain and near death, he look's up in time to see the love of his life scream as she is stuck down from behind in a lifeless heap. Over come with rage Dorious climb's to his feet, turn's to face his foe just as Redwing let's yet another blast rip into his already broken body. He fall's to his knee's gripping his chest in pain, not sure if the blast's or the sight of Sornum falling was the cause. Tear's start to roll down his face as he look's up into the eye's of his foe who rush's up to` finish's him off with a mighty blow to his head. He know's Sornum will be waiting for him at the end of this now blinding light which seem's to be pulling him from the pain and frozen ground upon which he lay. <br>
<br>
Not being all that far away, Bandll hear's the scream's and runs quickly in the direction from which they came. He arives to late to help. Both of his fellow villager's lay motionless in the snow with no sign of an attacker anywhere around. From the look's of the bodies, he know's who is responsible.<br>
He carries the bodies back to the village one by one knowing that thier son is now with out a mother and father. He can do little more then ask the Shaman guild to raise this boy as everyone know's the boy to be fond of the way's of a shaman. <br>
Shamer had one last chance to see his parent's before their bodies are burned in the pyre. Tear's ran down his face as he swore to them that he would avenge thier death. And from that day forward everything he did, from practicing his alchemy, to sharpening his casting abilities, it was all with the thought of his parent's in the front of his mind, fueling his desire as he would make every attempt to rid the land's of the foul blooded Orc's, where ever they may be.<br>
<br>
After eight season's of killing Orc's, Goblin's and other evil in the area, he felt he could make it across the Karana's. Shamer had heard of a city of Orc's in the Old country of Faydwer called Crush bone and the Clan Crush bone orc's that were enslaving the enhabitant's of the area.. The journey would not be easy by no mean's, but the reward of laying waste to Orc's was over powering. He had to go and the people of the Halas knew they could not stop him. All they could do was prepare and train him as best they could. Shamer had a heavy heart for leaving the shaman guild, the villager's and the only home he had ever known, but he had a look in his eye that could not be denieded. And with that look, he set out.......<br>
<br>
Across the Karana's he went, avoiding bandit's, lion's, and larger unknown beast's that could easily slay him along the way.  After a couple day's travel and no sleep he found his way to Freeport, the human city, and the cross road's of the continent's. He would set sail on the next ship that would take him even further away from everything he thought he knew. After quite a sail and a little fishing, he arived in the mountains of Butcher Block. A name he did not want to find the meaning too. He quickly found someone to lead him thru the hill's with out bloodshed to the city of the wood elves called Kelethin. Shamer beded down near the bank to gather his strength and rest up from the long journey. <br>
<br>
The next day Shamer woke up with a fire burning inside like the ones back home that would light half the village. But this fire didn't bring warmth, it brought a lust for blood....Orc blood. He bound himself at the nearest lift to Crush bone and readied himself and his spell's for what ever he may run into.<br>
<br>
Up a and over a hill he could hear them. Their pathetic grunt's and snorts, the growls that must have been the last thing his parent's heard before their lives where cut down and left him alone in the coldest place in Antonica, cold not only from weather, but from loneliness and sadness. <br>
Shamer summon's up a jagged ball of frozen sliver's and send's it slamming into one of the orc's. It is shredded and near death but still comes running at him. Two well placed swing's with his hammer and the beast fall's crying out that his death will not go unnoticed....as I though of my parents death not going unnoticed. <br>
These Orc's were young and weak, and I knew that if I was to gain ground on their land's I would need to venture further into their lands.<br>
<br>
Seeing some stronger adventurer's than myself running towards a cave in the side of the hill I followed them to see where about's they were heading. Thru this cave I saw dozens of Orc's. This was to be my place of vengence or my place of burial.<br>
<br>
