However I do have a serious question that may be prone to generating some heat (thus im not posting on Ahjess's/Alihja's board)<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Q- Whats the general consensus on killing the 4th warder on Druzzil Ro? I guess at the moment this question should be aimed at Vindication, HOSS, and maybe Lmalla..since those 3 seem like they would have the best chance atm of killing Ventani anytime soon.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br><br>Just for background info when a guild kills the 4th warder and frees The Sleeper, all the dragons start babbling crap about the sleeper being freed, an hour or so of hell breaks lose in some Velious zones, and then nada, zip, ghandi. Well theres a small catch. Several pieces of primal weaponry become almost near extinct, no more SODs and some other warder only drops. The warders and the Sleeper do not respawn. Primal bows and hammers pretty much become extinct, and ST is relegated to a zone that people farm crap from the golems. Not to mention word is in that over the entire zone the primal drop rate hits the shitter. In addition to the problem it creates with primal weaponry drops, it also denies many people the experience to see the sleeper, battle the warders,  etc etc. <br><br>IMO killing the 4th warder is an _extremely_ selfish act that does absolutely nothing except screw over your peers, and others who are not yet able to hit ST. I know on some servers theres a consensus to leave the 4th warder up. But on others one of the high end guilds took the opportunity and slew Ventani.<br><br>Whats the consensus for this on Druzzil? Would be nice if he could be left up so everyone could have a chance at experiencing ST pre-Sleeper release.<br><br><br>ps. Those post-Sleeper quests are decent, but again word is in that the scales are almost as rare as primal hammers and bows after the sleeper is released. Clearly there is a problem post Sleeper.<br><br> <p>Belegir~Retired~<b><i>"Restorer of Nature's Balance"</b></i></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub48.ezboard.com/unumenorean.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Numenorean</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif" BORDER=0> at: 11/19/01 4:49:50 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub48.ezboard.com/uducetgladio.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ducet Gladio</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#939393>(11/19/01 6:39:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub48.ezboard.com/fbishboardfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Sleepers Tomb-serious bish board question for Druzzil</span><hr size=1>  Hoss is the only guild i imagine has the &quot;Skillz&quot; to kill warder 4. I would also say Hoss has the deciency not to, least until sleeper is killed and his loots are revieded for Risk versus Reward. Mobs like Tunare, whose loots totally suck compared to time spent killing her, are not worth killing even though loots are very good and &quot;coolness&quot; factor is off the scale. Before 4th warder is killed, i think the risk versus reward is very bad, not to mention primal weapons would be alot more scarce. <br><br>Plus i doubt anybody could kill 4th warder on Druzzil at the momment... perhaps in a month or 2.

There is no need to kill all 4, and if you want to see if you can down Venati (or however you spell it), it can be done without releasing the Sleeper.  If you want to know what happens when you release the sleeper, go read FoH's board.  Basically you end up cutting off the primal source.  There are a few quests after that, but they've been reported as being pretty stupid.<br><br>There is no point in releasing the Sleeper, absolutely none.
