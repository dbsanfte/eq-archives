Bard Melee:<br>
<br>
Bards do about 50-65% of the damage a similarly equipped warrior can do. A bards defense is equal to that of a ranger and the bards hitpoints are equal to those of a rogue. With very few exceptions instruments equip in the offhand (and prevent the equipping of a weapon in the primary hand). So although songs with instruments equipped can be amazingly powerful the bard loses her melee ability. <br>
<br>
<br>
Bard Songs:<br>
<br>
Bards receive one song per level (sometimes 2-3 at higher levels). Songs can effect the party, the target, AE or be self-only. Each song has an instrument skill associated with it (Drum, Strings, Brass, Wind or Voice). Using the appropriate instrument will greatly enhance the effect of the song. It varies from song to song but a very general rule of thumb is a song will be twice as effective if an instrument is equipped. There are a few songs that require the appropriate instrument be equipped before the song will work (invisibility, occlusion, cantana of soothing (mana/HP regen), and the Ervaj line (5% and 10% hastes that stack with everything)). These songs can be very nice but the loss of the bard’s melee ability to get the song’s benefit usually prevents them from being sung except for special circumstances or if the Bard has an epic weapon. <br>
<br>
Bards usually do not use mana when they sing. The one major exception to this is charm, which uses mana each time it is refreshed. Nothing will speed up a bard’s mana regeneration so after a res (mana drops to zero after res) it takes a bard a long time to regain enough mana to charm effectively. Also, bards get zero medding skill so it takes them longer then most casters to memorize songs.<br>
<br>
For a run down of bard songs and what each one does check out <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.geocities.com/eqreed/BardSongSpreadsheet.html">Reed’s Spreadsheet</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->. <br>
<br>
<br>
Stacking:<br>
<br>
Bard buff songs tend to stack with other buffs with the major exception being haste, of course. There are two bard haste songs that do stack but they are both instrument only and so (with few exceptions) will only be used by epic equipped bards. Many bard songs have multiple effects. So even if one effect is negated because of some other class’s spell the song can still be useful. For example many of the haste songs have stat bonuses as well and the higher level snare song is actually slowing and debuffing the mobs AC and AGI.<br>
<br>
<br>
Twisting:<br>
<br>
Song effects usually last 12 seconds. It takes 3 seconds to stop a song and start a new one. So typically a bard can twist 3 songs at a time. Some bards can twist 4 with a good Internet connection, but the general bard community’s opinion is it’s not worth the hassle or the tendency to have a buff drop. With buff procing (BoH) weapons it’s easy to give the impression of stacking 4 songs. Often one or more songs are targeted on the mob and if buff slots are tight it’s a good idea to ask the bard how many slots you should be keeping open for Bard songs. If you have every buff slot filled there is a good chance that what you are missing from the Bard is better then at least one of your buffs. If you aren’t sure ask the Bard what the exact stats on their song buffs are (and if the bard doesn’t know kick em in the butt and tell em to down load Reed’s Spreadsheet and find out). <br>
<br>
<br>
Pulling with Lament:<br>
<br>
Bards are extremely good at single pulling groups of mobs. The level 8 Lament song is a single target song that will basically decrease the mobs agro range to zero. It is a bit like harmony but works indoors. Since it’s a targeted song it will not work well in locations were mobs agro as soon as you turn a corner or open a door. This songs duration is fairly long however no message is received when it breaks so usually its best to not try and lament more then 3 or 4 mobs before making the pull. Lament tends to be very effective on any mob that is blue to the bard, although of course some are more resistant then others. There is a possibility the mob will agro if Lament is resisted and the pulling bard should be far enough from the group she can stand and die if a pull goes bad. With a high level bard Lament will work just about any place (including many high end dungeon encounters) and can be very useful for pulling just the named mobs out of areas. Some bards like to use a tagger who will target the desired mob and then pull on the bard’s command. <br>
<br>
Lament is also a great song for getting past mobs that see through invis. Just toss on a Lament and the whole group can quickly run past, though it is best to stay as far away from the mob as possible when doing this.<br>
<br>
<br>
Crowd Control:<br>
<br>
Bards are very effective at crowd control (CC)and in many situations can be used in place of an enchanter. Bards can’t lock down as many mobs as a good enchanter can so pullers who insist on bring back 4 or 5 mobs are not a good match for a group using a Bard for CC. <br>
<br>
Bards have two songs they use for crowd control, Solon’s Bewitching Bravura (charm) and Song of Twilight (mez). Both songs do not work on mobs that are 56+. Bard charm lasts 18 seconds and the song can not be refreshed until it has broken. So a bard will almost always take a bit of a beating when she is charming. Careful timing and the ability to step a distance away from the fight will minimize this. With just one add many bards prefer charm over mez since the charmed mob will do a lot more damage then the bard melee will contribute. Bard mez can be used to keep up to 3 mobs locked down (4 with a skilled bard, good connection and no resists). Bards can also keep multiple adds busy by charming one and setting it to attack another extra instead of the primary target or by using a combination of charm and mez. Bards can be used for CC pretty much anyplace you would go for an experience grind and even in many high end dungeon encounters depending on the ability of your puller and the levels in your group.<br>
<br>
Song of Twilight (mez) also has a magic debuff component (-14MR or –25 w/ instrument) and will push the mob in the opposite direction the bard is facing. So mez is also useful to pull mobs away from walls during a fight and for general mob positioning.<br>
<br>
<br>
Song Selection (single group):<br>
<br>
The power of a bard in small groups is their ability to fill many different roles. Bards take into consideration what classes are in the group and the type of mobs being fought when picking out their songs. Assuming no specialty songs such as fear, or resists, are needed a bard needs to decide if their role is to maximize the damage the group can do or minimize the damage the group will take. <br>
<br>
Setting up songs to minimize damage is usually the best approach when there is no cleric in the group. A bard has a number of regen and damage absorption songs to choose from. The amount of damage a bard can prevent is impressive and pairs great with shaman slows when you have a shaman for primary healer. The party should spread the damage around as much as they can to maximize the HP regen. These songs work best in a typical experience grind situation and this is not meant to suggest a bard and shaman can replace a cleric on heavy hitting raid mobs. One draw back is (depending on the exact song selection) the bard might need to equip a lute and so bard melee is lost. <br>
<br>
It is impossible to point to one particular song line up when it comes to maximizing group damage. Song choices depend far more on bard level, the exact make up of the group and rather the bard is epic equipped since the bard probably wouldn’t want to go all instrument attack. Typically if there is no one else to haste the bard will pick her highest haste song, the slow/snare/AC debuff song and some other party buff song (mana/hp/stamina regen if the party is heavily caster based or stat buffs if the party is mostly melee based). A great deal of damage can be done by equipping a drum and twisting the 3 bard DoT songs but then bard melee input as well as the additional input from bard buffs on the group is lost. However DoTing with a drum is a great way to go if you are rooting the mob (no melee) or if a pet is tanking. A lot of song selection in this type of group is simply personal preference. <br>
<br>
<br>
Song Selection (large raids):<br>
<br>
Song selection on large raids will depend first on what mobs are being attacked. Obviously the need for Occlusion or resist buffs will take precedent. In high end encounter song selection depends on the group the bard is in. When bards are present on the raid more consideration needs to be put into building the groups. Keep in mind that bards are most effective if they are concentrating on one task, either trying to buff melee to maximize damage or providing mana regen. The primary tanks group should get the highest level bard (or the bard with the epic if one is present) and consist of 4 melee, the bard and a cleric (no other casters). This bard should then concentrate on singing the best party buff songs and DS songs they have (more then likely the mana/HP/stamina song will not be in this line up). The bard in the caster group is then free to concentrate on mana regen and not worry about buffing a party for melee.<br>
<br>
<br>
Bard Epic:<br>
<br>
The bard epic is the most powerful tool a high level bard can get. When the epic first came out many bards scoffed at the stats and commented it simply wasn’t going to be worth the hassle. However the epic was enhanced so it gives the same song benefits as having all the different instruments equipped. This makes it possible for a bard to sing any of the instrument requiring songs (Occlusion and the Ervaj line) and still melee and also to receive the full benefit of any song without having to equip an instrument. The instrument component of the epic makes it one of the most powerful epics in the game and probably the best at increasing a groups overall damage. Obviously there are many ways of defining the best epic and I am in no way trying to say the Bard epic is the best overall epic. The cleric epic is best at decreasing rezzing time after a large wipe out (a VERY important thing for a raiding guild) and the enchanter epic is probably the best at decreasing buff time for raids. That being said the bard epic rocks and I threw this section in here because of the large number of people who don’t realize the instrument component of the epic or the importance of this feature.<br>
<br>
<br>
Travelling with a Bard:<br>
<br>
A high level bard singing Selo’s with a drum will make SoW feel like a crawl. There are two Selo songs. The first is received at level 5 and only increases travel speed. The second is received at level 51 and increases travel speed, levitates and invisis the party. When a party is using bard Selo’s to travel all party members need to remove SoW. SoW will not overwrite Selo’s so if SoW’s are needed at the end of the journey be sure and wait for Selo’s to time out. <br>
<br>
All group members should auto follow the same person and it should NOT be the bard who leads the way. If the bard leads it is easy for someone to fall towards the back of the group and lose a pulse of Selo’s. If the bard is in the middle of the pack it is much easier to keep everyone in the song effect radius. If the bard must lead (because no one else knows were they are going or other party members are AFK) it is a good idea for the bard to turn walk on so there is little chance of outrunning party members. Level 51 Selo’s is instantly interrupted if you are attacked and all effects are lost. Because of this and because there is always a chance your bard will go LD it is not a good idea to get any higher off the ground then you are willing to fall when using this song.<br>
<br>
Bards also have a group invis song that requires a wind instrument (so don’t ask a naked bard to invis you anyplace). This song should be used as a party travel song only as a last resort, unless party members are all familiar with the technique. Party members should all stay BEHIND the bard and should NOT use auto follow. Sometimes to be extra safe the bard will turn on walk or at least stop often to make sure everyone is present. Do not get impatient with your bard and run ahead – most bards have died more then once when trying to use this song and tend to be overly cautious about keeping everyone in song radius. Bard invis song will not effect an invis already cast on anyone in the group though it will prevent invis from sticking if it is cast while the bard is singing. Often it is handy to invis everyone the traditional way and then stay close to the bard just incase an invis wears off prematurely. <br>
<br>
<br>
Mana Song:<br>
<br>
There are 4 songs that provide some type of mana regeneration, two clarity songs and two cantata songs. The clarity songs are received at level 20 (2 mana) and level 32 (7 mana). These songs are pulse songs (it is a mana infusion not a speeding up of mana regeneration) and do not generate a buff icon. The songs will stack with each other and with themselves so multiple bards in a group can sing them for full effect. Since the songs are pulse based the effect does not last the usual 12 seconds and should be twisted every other song to receive the maximum mana infusion. So full mana infusion can still be achieved while twisting in one other song but not while doing the regular three song twist.<br>
<br>
The cantata songs are received at level 34 (5 mana; 8 HP; stamina regin – lute REQUIRED) and level 55 (12 mana; 11 HP or 23 with lute; stamina regin). The cantata line is a true regeneration song and it does result in a buff icon. The songs do not stack with each other although they can be used with the clarity line to increase mana regeneration even more. <br>
<br>
So the highest possible mana regeneration would be achieved by twisting 55 Cantata and 32 Clarity. However there are very few situations were a 55+ bard would ever memorize Clarity or bother twisting it into a song line up other then during a corpse retrieval and major rezzing party. <br>
<br>
While a mana song is always a crowd pleaser keep in mind there are a lot of useful bard songs and depending on the situation a bard can add more to a party by leaving this song out and putting in a buff or some other song. This of course depends on the situation but particularly if the bard is doing CC and their isn’t a shaman present for haste expect to see the mana song left out of the twist a great deal. Also in a group that is melee heavy and the cleric is keeping up with heals there are probably more effective songs that can be sung, particularly if the bard is high level and has an epic weapon.<br>
<br>
<br>
Bard Equipment and misc info:<br>
<br>
There are a number of useful right click items that are bard only. Singing Steal (SS) helm summons an eye of zoom. SS boots cast a long duration group lev. The lev is duration is shorter then most spells but longer then your typical bard song. This lev will overwrite other lev spells though, including the lev portion of DMF so some care should be taken when using it. This effect is very useful when the party needs to be lev’d for a short period of time for travel. SS bracer casts a 9 pt DS that stacks with all other DS as long it is stacked on last. There are many other useful tools for a bard and I’m making no attempt to list them all here. I just wanted to mention a couple of the effects that might be useful to the group as a whole.<br>

Bard of 56 level <br>

<br>
Let me finish this with adding a few of my own comments.<br>
<br>
1) Haste.<br>
This is worth repeating since a lot of folks don't know it, bard haste does NOT stacking with any form of spell/proc/effect haste. Only the best haste applies.<br>
You can ONLY have 1 permanent haste + 1 song/spell/effect at a time.<br>
I repeat, does NOT stack with spell/proc/effect haste.<br>
Now, many of the bards haste songs have additional effects. These will in most cases stack and which is why you might see both a chanter haste and bard haste buff icons up at the same time. All components of both buffs will usually stack, EXCEPT the haste effect. Everyone got that now?<br>
Ok, so every rule has an exception...<br>
L50 and L60 and bard haste songs stack with EVERYTHING but not past the haste cap. BUT for a bard to use one of these song he must equip an instrument and the haste % is so pathetic that you wont see any bard using this if it's not a bard with his epic.<br>
<br>
2) The bard epic.<br>
This needs emphasizing. The bard epic works as all instrument types (as well as a weapon...), meaning that the bard don't have to juggle his instruments and weapons in order to play song that otherwise would REQUIRE an instrument.<br>
For example, invis song, the haste songs mentioned in 1) and occlusion of sound.<br>
Not only that, it also boosts ALL songs as if an instrument of the appropriate type was equipped.<br>
Not to mention the kick-ass proc on that weapon....<br>
Needless to say, this epic never leaves a bards hands once he gets it (except when he dies, but then it's still in his hands technically).<br>
<br>
3) Crowd control.<br>
Bards are excellent at CC, but there are a few things to remember before trusting this to the bard.<br>
Bards have a number of ways of doing CC, but the most common and least fatal (if used correctly) are, mez and charm.<br>
Bards get three forms of mez. First mez is gained at 15 and is actually an AE mez. Don't use this. Ever. It's hopelessly broken, but &quot;working as intended&quot; according to Verant. Second form of mez is gained at 28 and that worked quite good when I got it many years ago. Since then a secondary resist was added and now this will only land once in a blue moon. But the bard is stuck with that until 53. Then bards really shine at mezzing. The L53 song is so good that it has never left my song bank since I got it. A few things you need to know as the non-bard here, is that:<br>
1. Nothing above 55 can be mezzed with this. So if you're going to face multiple 56-60 mobs you better think of something else.<br>
2. This song needs to be refreshed every 3 ticks or so, so the most a bard can mez is 3 (or 4 if he's really good and on a fast machine with a solid connection) if he don't get too many resists.<br>
3. Make sure you know the bard, and that he know's how to mez. This applies to any class in any pick-up group situation. It's not the class/race that gets you killed, it's the moron behind the keyboard.<br>
4. If all 3 of the above is followed don't be surprised by what you can do. If you can't get an enchanter to accompany you, don't be afraid to ask the neighbourhood bard. In a lot of normal grouping situations the bard will do just as well as the chanter.<br>
<br>
A few words about charm. This will usually be the bards best form of CC before L53. There are two charm songs. The first one is a L27 song. It costs no mana and works on all mobs L1-37. L38+ mobs will have to be charmed with the second charm song, which is gained at L39 and works on all mobs L1-51. Nothing L52+ can be charmed by a bard. One thing to remember here is that the second song cost mana to use. Each pulse cost 20 mana. Let's say each charm lasts 15 seconds (high), thats 80 mana per minute to keep something charmed. For a L60 bard with 100 Int, that's 15 minutes worth of charm before he's OOM. Which brings me to..<br>
<br>
4) Manaregen.<br>
Nothing speed up a bards manaregen besides sitting. All those manasongs and none work on ourselves! This includes clarity etc. Not even +Mana items effects a bards manapool.<br>
 This means that after the bard dies there will be no CC in the form of charm for quite awhile (well, nothing L38+ that is).<br>
<br>
5) Manasong.<br>
Nothing makes the bard aggro on you as much as hearing that dreaded, &quot;manasong plz&quot;.<br>
If it's downtime, first make sure you haven't turned off all particle effects and bard-spamming before saying those words.<br>
Secondly, casters have a tendancy to scatter all over the room. If you are not getting the effects of manasong you are most likely out of range. In my oppinion it is NOT the bards duty to dance all over the room trying to get casters in range of the manasong. If you want manasong, go park your ass next to the bard, he's most likely already playing it while you're busy typing out your &quot;manasong plz&quot;.<br>
<br>
Read the above about the different forms of mana that the bard can provide. But I'm going to throw out some numbers there for you to think about.<br>
L32 song gives everyone in the group a shot of 7 mana on each pulse. L55 puts up a buff icon that last 3 ticks and gives the party 12 mana, 11 hp and stamina per tick.<br>
Over a minute that's 70 mana with L32 and 120 mana with L55. In a long fight, sure I'll start up manasong but consider those numbers before you ask the bard to turn on manasong during combat. There's alot of other things the bard can do to take out the mobs besides pumping mana to the casters.<br>
Just using myself as an exampel, if I were to equip my drum and start up all my DoT's that's almost 200hp/tick damage on one mob. Or how about 30% haste, +30 str, +30 agi, +21 AC on all party members PLUS 32% slow, -16 AC , -47 agi on one mob PLUS +32 MR/HR/CR, +6 AC on all party members.<br>
I could go on, but you get the idea.<br>
<br>
Think about it an extra time before starting to type out &quot;manasong plz&quot;<br>
<br>
Can't think of anything else but if I do I'll update this guide.<br>
I hope you've all learned something new and look upon the bard with awe... if not, you've already had the pleasure of grouping with a bard <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Jokes aside, I gotta agree with you one the manasong part. There are far better things for a minstrell to do. There is also some sort of damage absorbing songas far as I know. Now there's something worth using. Maybe not against boss mobs who hit for 400+ every hit.<br>

Bards are always an asset to a group, far more usable than a Shadowknight or Ranger and don't even get me started on Pallies.<br>

Especially paired with shammys slow and regens.<br>
<br>
I don't have my spreadsheet handy so I can't give you the correct figures but,<br>
Shield of Song (L49, our best &quot;Rune&quot;) absorbs about 20 damage singing and 40 using a banjo.<br>
Hymn of Restoration (L6, regen) heals about 10 HP or 20 with banjo per tick for 3 ticks.<br>
Using the 7-stringed lute from Maestro in Hate increases the numbers to about 50 for SoS and 25 for HoR.<br>
<br>
A good 3 twist would be, SoS - SoS - HoR.<br>
<br>
Shammy slaps a regen on each tank before fight.<br>
When mob is pulled he slows it.<br>
Start your twistin'<br>
Get the tanks to spread the damage.<br>
<br>
I even heard reports of deep Sebilis groups done without clerics using that combo <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
But as you said, I wouldn't try that on Inny <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
