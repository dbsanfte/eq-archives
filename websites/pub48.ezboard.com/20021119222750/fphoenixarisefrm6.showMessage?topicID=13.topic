Wizard style.</span><hr size=1> Hello all fellow wizards I am back.<br>
<br>
This time I will try to explain how to quad kite in CS. I did it successfully at lvl 51. It was not easy and I had a few bad incidents. (1 death due to own fault, 2 deaths in all).<br>
<br>
So here comes my experience on how to quadkite.<br>
<br>
Again this is a subjective matter and people's opinion may differ. All comments are welcome as long as they are in a constructive fashion.<br>
<br>
Oki your lvl 51 and you are about to begin your quadkiting days. But are you ready ?<br>
<br>
Here are the bare essentials in my viewpoint to quadkiting wizardstyle.<br>
<br>
Staff of the temperal flux<br>
Jboots, Tboots, or sow potions (in that order of preference).<br>
Pillar of Frost (51)<br>
Atols shackles (51) or Bonds of force (29) (in that order of preference).<br>
Mana pool 2.5K or more<br>
Faction dubious against ToV.<br>
<br>
I will try to explain why these things are needed.<br>
<br>
Staff of the temperal Flux<br>
This is a quest staff you get from Solusek Ro Temple. It is a right clickable targeted debuff with a casting time of INSTANT.<br>
<br>
The beauty of this baby is that you do NOT have to equip it to make it work. I have it in a main inventory slot with a equip slot on my main 8 slot action bar.<br>
Now it debuffs fire and cold for 6 resistance both. That is weak compared to so many other classes debuff abilities. BUT it is the ONLY debuff you will ever have in the game (luclin not included). There is another good catch to this if you attempt a debuff with this low agro effect item you gain faction for that kill. Faction gaining in kael anyone ?<br>
<br>
This staf can be used ON THE RUN and it has a nice range. It is the main reason I have had a good succes with my Quadkiting.<br>
<br>
Jboots, Tboots, or sow potions.<br>
Why do I pick em in that order simple.<br>
<br>
Jboots casting time INSTANT.<br>
You can activate em on the run...<br>
Tboots over sow potions ... you can run out of sow potions.<br>
you need speed for quadkiting. If you don't have speed forget quadkiting.<br>
<br>
Pillar of Frost (lvl 51)<br>
This is the baby that makes it all possible. It is massive damage on a large scale.<br>
<br>
Stats:<br>
mana 325<br>
damage 755 (lvl51) upto 4 targets*.<br>
*There is a catch the 4th victim is never hit by the full effect. always a partial resist.<br>
Area of effect 15 feet radius.<br>
<br>
So a best scenario you hit 3 times 755 and the last is a partial for 600 or so. That is above 3K damage in one blow or above 9 points of damage per mana. Enough said.<br>
<br>
Atols shackles or bonds of force.<br>
<br>
It comes down to the most limiting factor for wizards TIME.<br>
Now if we look at our quadkiting brothers and sisters (druids) they have a nice cheap single target snare spell with a duration of 10 minutes. If only we where so lucky.<br>
<br>
Bonds of force AE slow 55% 2 minutes.<br>
Atols shackles AE slow 66% 2,5 minutes.<br>
<br>
2,5 minutes not much compared to the druids snare. But done properly its all the time in the world. Your could probably do it with only 2 minutes but 30 seconds extra (or 25% more time) sounds nice to me.<br>
<br>
Mana Pool 2.5K<br>
This is how much mana you should have before attempting my tactic. It was my mana pool at lvl 51 and it usually ended with 20% mana and 4 dead wyverns. The 20% mana is a nice safety valve incase you need to nuke that annoying &quot;I'm still standing&quot; wyvern. Or root an add, Fast getaway etc. etc.<br>
<br>
So its time to get to the tactic part.<br>
Now hop over to CS get a feel for the place. If at all possible note where ALL the wyverns spawn and the Drakes pathing. Usually the place is camped bare. But occasionally (after a patch) its fully populated. Now you need to setup your 3rd person view points. If you don't know what I am talking about Give me a tell in game. Basically its F9 alternate viewing angles. Now aline em to the look back and forth on the rock formations from the Dragon circle up to the skyshrine exit stone. These will be your way of keeping tabs on your targets. Now your ready. Oki here goes....<br>
<br>
you locate 4 wyverns they don't have to stand neck and neck they can be in each end of the zone.<br>
<br>
Oki you hit your auto run tab ( from this point on your running untill you hit em with AE snare )<br>
 and debuff the first wyvern. Switch to your alternate viewing angles and check your progress. If everything is oki head for the next wyvern do the same. <br>
<br>
Now if all goes well you have 4 wyverns on your tail and they are pretty pissed off. <br>
<br>
start circling them until they are stacked. (don't fall down)<br>
<br>
When they look like one you gain some distance. stop AE snare em. START running again instantly the spell hits. It can be resisted. Two scenarios can happen.<br>
<br>
Scenario 1<br>
All 4 got snared. Your home free. Start gaining a little ground and Kite em to death with pillar.<br>
<br>
Scenario 2<br>
1 resisted. Now you can still make it. But if you want to play it safe gate out. Here is what you do. Get some distance circle back and when you have the proper distance ae snare the last one. Now your on a timer you have 150 seconds from the FIRST snare so keep that in mind. if you have wasted a full minute its time to gate out call it a day. You have used minimal of your mana and the biggest loss is the 4 kills. Gate out, gate back, med up to full. Start anew.<br>
<br>
If you have everything under control get em together again and start nuking em down.<br>
<br>
That is the basics. Now a little note of caution.<br>
<br>
Drakes: They roam. They have a clear cut path they do not deviate from. They AE nuke for 300 DD. You do not want to mess with em any more than your forced to. They can be kited. But generally its the Necros who kill em.<br>
<br>
NAMED MOBS: They exist, there is a named Drake and a named WYVERN. Always look for them. They are almost always guarantied to be there. You will take negative CoV faction from killing em. So leave em alone.<br>
<br>
BULROGS: Nasty mobs live down on the beach but sometimes they get agroed and the fool trains em to SS zone. They are KOS to all. They hit hard, have a ton of hp and are generally unkitable (oom). (maybe higher up).<br>
<br>
Sirens: Same as the bulrogs except they are enchanter class monsters. and they Charm. They really really like to charm.<br>
<br>
Ottermen: They are cute they are nonaggressive (unless you kill em) and they are the only merchants in the zone.<br>
<br>
That is it. My experience from Cobalt Scars.<br>
<br>
If you ever consider kiting I will be happy to assist for a trial run. and some added pointers. (This post is way to long already.<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading<br>

<br>
Nice to know someone reads my posts :-)<br>
<br>
A little added info I did not include plus an correction.<br>
<br>
First of all exp gain plus loot.<br>
<br>
At 51 I gained half a blue bubble from a single quadkite.<br>
<br>
They drop random amounts of money, think the highest gained from one is 6pp.<br>
<br>
They drop research components for all spell classes. Lvl 39 spells I belive.<br>
<br>
They drop jewelry items. They commonly go for 10 15 pp a piece.<br>
<br>
They drop gems..... armor quest gems..... and crap gems.<br>
<br>
Crap gems goes for 46pp with the ottermen. Maybe more if you have higher charisma (92) or better faction (indifferent).<br>
<br>
Quest armor gems.<br>
In the beginning of my kiting days I exclusively got flawed gems. But with time I have gained other types. Nephrite and jaudice. I have however not received any crushed gems.<br>
<br>
Arctic wyvern skin. Velious tailoring armor component (shaman only) Got 23 in the bank. Might even give it a go if I can get my tailoring up to 150 (Trivial &gt;200).<br>
<br>
Now my correction. In my original post I wrote that the fourth hit from pillar of frost was always a partial effect. I can say that I have successfully at lvl 52 nuked 4 wyverns for full effect. So max effect on Pillar at frost (lvl 52) is.<br>
<br>
4 x 760 = 3040 points of damage. :-)<br>
<br>
9.3 points of damage per mana.<br>
Enough said.<br>
<br>

Wizard style.</span><hr size=1> Really Nice post Akbah!<br>
<br>
Me being a druid I know a thing or two about quadkiting(druid style). As Akbah said in his post mana is one of the main focuses in quading. Before you start to REALLY quad kite mobs do a trial run. <br>
A trial run is simple to do. Pull one mob and start quading it using the quadkite spells, get a feel and you will find out wether or not you have sufficient mana for quading the mobs. If things go wrong you only have one mob aggroed and that makes it easier to get away alive.<br>

Wizard style.</span><hr size=1> Adding some info, since I have quadded in CS with belcarl a lot. Note that Im a lazy gnome, and Akbahs way is more mana effective, although mine is slightly safer.<br>
<br>
Crushed gems do drop as do chipped. No BP gems have dropped in Cs to my knowledge though, but Ive given away like 8x melee greaves gems.<br>
<br>
when my mana pool was large enough, around 2800 I didnt bother to hit them with a lvl 1 blast to aggro. I just snared them one each (safer) then ran around in circles (again to lazy to use 3rd view although Ive done it that way too) and finally reapplied BoF. Didnt use Atols since it costs more mana and if someone resists Atols when I pulled with BoF they have different running speed.<br>
<br>
Drakes stopped aggroing once I hit lvl 52 unless I quadded straight through them. Yvolcarn and Azurake are still a pain though, Ive tried to solo Yvolcarn but the bugger seems immune to snare.<br>
<br>
Finally, once you hit lvl 51 and can quad with Pillar of frost Spirocs in Timourous deep is actually better. Less hp, 1500-1800 to Wyverns 3000(correct me if Im wrong here bad memmory). Spirocs are harder to pull though, but not impossible <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
the loot is not as phat though, and one cannot bind in TD, so only way to get there is through the boat in oasis. Some spirocs will start to become lightblue at lvl 52, but I made lvl 53 in like 10 hours of quadding at the spiroc tree. I could make 2 quads and still have 20% mana left, thats an amazing xp rate.<br>
<br>
Once I hit lvl 54 there suddenly where no place left to quad for me. 75% of the wyverns in CS are Lightblue and more or less all spirocs are, Raptors in TD still takes pretty much of my mana bar if I solo one. Add that their aggro range is like 300, anyone with a good throwing weapon will see how nasty it is. I will probably try them again once I hit lvl 55, Ive manage to kill 3 at a time but it was a lucky shot.<br>
<br>

All the spirocs (or most of them became light blue) and didn't give sufficient amount of exp for the amount of time it took to med and actually do the kite.

I did find this AWESOME place in echo caverns where i can dot kite; however, it's kinda difficult w/o my epic or Winged Death (53) so until then i dunno what i'm gonna do.  There's also these skellies in Echo Caverns w/ only 1k hp which is pretty dang good.  (INC nerf).  also there's archers in there who drop 2 bows that...if i read it right go for about 20pp per and don't move...just shoot. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Once again it's a dot kite if you're into that type of thing.
