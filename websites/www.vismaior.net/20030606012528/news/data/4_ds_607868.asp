							The Associated Press<br><br><br>JERUSALEM<p class="nitfp">Israeli troops shot and killed a 16-year-old Palestinian boy and critically wounded two children, ages 7 and 9, during confrontations that erupted Tuesday in the West Bank as Israeli and Palestinian leaders moved toward talks on a new Mideast peace plan.</p>
<p class="nitfp">The shootings - which the Israeli army said came in response to attacks by Palestinians throwing stones and molotov cocktails - took place a day after Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon declared that Israel's occupation in the West Bank must end, stunning both dovish opponents and hardline allies.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Sharon's remarks and Israel's conditional acceptance Sunday of the so-called "road map" to peace were expected to jump-start stalled Mideast peace negotiations.</p>
<p class="nitfp">A summit between Sharon and his Palestinian counterpart, Mahmoud Abbas, is planned for later this week and a three-way summit with President Bush could take place as early as next week, possibly in Jordan.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Israeli soldiers shot and killed a 16-year-old Palestinian boy and wounded a 7-year-old boy after opening fire at stone throwers in the Tulkarem refugee camp in the West Bank on Tuesday, Palestinian hospital officials said. The army said troops fired, and hit a boy, after a Palestinian youth threw a molotov cocktail.</p>
<p class="nitfp">In a village near the West Bank city of Nablus on Tuesday, Israeli troops opened fire on youths throwing stones, hitting a 9-year-old Palestinian boy in the head and critically wounding him, and hitting two 12-year-old boys in the legs, lightly wounding them, Palestinian hospital officials said. A 10-year-old boy was struck in the leg by a rubber bullet, but was not seriously hurt, the officials said. 	Military sources said troops were trying to break up stone-throwing protests, but did not use live fire. The army was not aware of any injuries.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Five Palestinian children, a Palestinian woman and a police officer, were injured Tuesday after accidentally detonating explosives in the West Bank city of Hebron, Palestinian security officials said. The children found the explosives in two plastic bags under a tree and accidentally detonated the first bag. After a police officer arrived, the second bag exploded, seriously injuring him, the officials said.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Israeli troops killed a Palestinian teenager Monday and another surrendered after infiltrating from Gaza, the military said. They were unarmed and apparently looking for work. In a village near the West Bank town of Qalqiliya, an 11-year-old Palestinian boy was killed during an exchange of gunfire.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Also Monday, Israeli soldiers fired on four diplomatic vehicles in the northern Gaza town of Beit Hanoun, diplomats said. There were no injuries from the incident. Peter Lundberg, an official from the Swedish Consulate in Jerusalem, said that two bullets hit the windshield of the consulate's armored car, and that small-arms fire also was directed at other diplomatic cars from Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark and the European Union.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Military sources said the Israeli army had established roadblocks at the entrance to Beit Hanoun to prevent Palestinians militants from leaving the area. The sources said shots had been fired in the air when vehicles tried to skirt the roadblocks.</p>
<p class="nitfp">The violence erupted after Sharon endured withering criticism Monday from members of his own Likud Party over his Cabinet's acceptance of the U.S.-backed "road map" peace plan.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Sharon indicated a 180-degree turnaround after decades of warning that an Israeli withdrawal from even small parts of the West Bank could endanger Israel's existence.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Skeptics, however, said it was yet another master performance from a wily politician who expected his newfound pliability would never be put to the test.</p>
<p class="nitfp">"To keep 3.5 million people under occupation is bad for us and them," Sharon said in remarks broadcast on Israel Radio.</p>
<p class="nitfp">The term "occupation" is anathema to the Israeli right, which believes Israel has a legitimate claim to the West Bank and Gaza Strip for religious and security reasons.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Palestinians and their dovish Israeli allies routinely use the word "occupation" when demanding that Israel leave the West Bank and Gaza and dismantle Jewish settlements.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Palestinians claim all of the West Bank and Gaza for a state.</p>
<p class="nitfp">On Sunday, Sharon's Cabinet conditionally approved the "road map," a three-phase plan that begins with a halt to violence and envisages a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 2005.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Sharon told party critics he was committed to finding a political solution to the conflict, including an Israeli withdrawal from West Bank population centers.</p>
<p class="nitfp">"This can't continue endlessly. Do you want to remain forever in Ramallah, Jenin, Nablus?" he asked.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Likud lawmakers charged that the road map was slanted in favor of the Palestinians and endangers Israel.</p>
<p class="nitfp">In his remarks Monday, Sharon left himself an out.</p>
<p class="nitfp">"What will happen if Palestinian terror continues? Nothing. Nothing will happen. The Palestinians will get nothing," he said.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Critics have said Sharon's long-held condition that all violence must stop before peace moves is unrealistic and guarantees failure of any peace initiative, including the road map, thus releasing him from the necessity of following through on his remarks.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Liberal lawmaker Yossi Sarid argued Sharon was trying to keep his intentions murky to persuade the U.S. government that he was committed to the plan, while his hawkish allies could assume he was just making a tactical move to end U.S. pressure.</p>
<p class="nitfp">"Ariel Sharon likes to walk in the fog, because then no one knows where he is headed," Sarid wrote in the Yediot Ahronot daily.</p>
