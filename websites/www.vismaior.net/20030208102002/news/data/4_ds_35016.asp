							02:27 AM EST January 29, 2003 
							<br>
							The Associated Press<br><br><br>ALEXANDRIA, Va.<p class="nitfp">Computer files and handwritten notes by Brian Patrick Regan suggest he promised foreign leaders U.S. secrets and sought advice on how to use offshore bank accounts and credit cards.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Yet government agents can't prove Regan ever sent his writings anywhere, acknowledges an FBI agent who investigated the former Air Force master sergeant.</p>
<p class="nitfp">"I am a Middle East/North Africa analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency. I am willing to commit espionage" against the United States, Regan allegedly wrote in a letter to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Regan wrote a nearly identical letter to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Both documents, found on a laptop computer agents seized inside his home, were read Tuesday in U.S. District Court by FBI agent Steven Carr, who headed the investigation leading to Regan's arrest.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Carr acknowledged the computer once belonged to the government and might have contained information from past users.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Regan worked as a civilian contractor at the National Reconnaissance Office, a secret government spy agency. He indicated in his letters that he was a 20-year CIA veteran nearing retirement and deserved more than the agency's small pension. He offered to provide access to more than 800 pages of classified information in exchange for $13 million in Swiss francs. He called the offer "a chance of a lifetime."</p>
<p class="nitfp">Regan has pleaded innocent to charges he offered sensitive information to Iraq, Libya and China. His espionage trial is the first in 50 years that could result in the death penalty.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Defense attorneys maintain that the Bowie, Md., resident was acting out a spy fantasy, lacked access to valuable information and never had any serious intent to jeopardize U.S. security.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Under cross-examination, Carr acknowledged that agents failed to find any of the hundreds of top-secret documents Regan claimed he possessed in his letters.</p>
<p class="nitfp">FBI agents had tapped Regan's phone, tracked his computer keystrokes and videotaped him at work for weeks before his Aug. 23, 2001, arrest outside Washington Dulles International Airport, where he was prepared to fly to Zurich, Switzerland.</p>
<p class="nitfp">A jail officer who conducted a strip search of Regan after his arrest testified Tuesday he found a piece of paper tucked between two insoles in one of Regan's shoes. The paper contained the addresses of the embassies and other diplomatic buildings that Iraq and China occupied in France, Switzerland and Austria, according to a retired State Department officer who examined the document.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Carr said Regan constantly accessed information, some classified, on Iraq and Libya while he worked at the National Reconnaissance Office, which operates U.S. spy satellites. He also frequently used a public library's computer to get details about foreign embassies. However, Carr said he was unaware of any personal contact Regan made with possible foreign officers, either in the United States or during a June 2001 trip he took to Europe.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Few spy cases ever make it to court, because the government would rather cut a deal than risk revealing its secrets in open court. As a partial resolution of that problem, attorneys have been displaying evidence to jurors and witnesses on computer monitors and a large television screen that is out of view of court spectators.</p>
