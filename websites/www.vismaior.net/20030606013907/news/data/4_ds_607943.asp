							10:13 AM EST May 27, 2003 
							<br>
							The Associated Press<br><br><br>MOSCOW<p class="nitfp">Chinese President Hu Jintao and Russian President Vladimir Putin called for a central United Nations role in rebuilding Iraq as they held talks on Tuesday aimed at strengthening the strategic partnership they formed after decades of rivalry.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Hu and Putin issued a joint declaration that appeared to be an attempt to defend their nations' economic interests in postwar Iraq.</p>
<p class="nitfp">"The legitimate rights, interests and concerns of neighboring nations and other interested parties must be taken into account during the postwar settlement and rebuilding of Iraq," the two leaders said in the declaration.</p>
<p class="nitfp">"The United Nations must be given the central role in the postwar reconstruction of Iraq."</p>
<p class="nitfp">The two leaders added that the international community must make joint efforts to "minimize the damage incurred to international relations by the war in Iraq."</p>
<p class="nitfp">Putin and Hu made a customary reference to the "multipolar world" - the term they use to describe their ambition to offset U.S. global power.</p>
<p class="nitfp">"Russia and China stand for a multipolar, just and democratic world order on the basis of internationally recognized principles of international law," they said.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Russian media said both leaders were interested in mending ties with Washington and were trying to avoid anti-U.S. statements.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Putin and Hu also pushed for a peaceful settlement of the standoff between the United States and North Korea, urging Pyongyang not to develop nuclear weapons and calling for the security guarantees sought by North Korea.</p>
<p class="nitfp">"Any scenarios of forceful pressure or use of force for solving the existing problems are unacceptable," the two leaders said.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Hu chose Russia for his first trip abroad after replacing Jiang Zemin as president in March in a long-planned succession.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Russian officials have stressed that they expect Hu to carry on the course of Jiang, who in 2001 signed a friendship treaty with Putin - the first since 1950, when Josef Stalin and Mao Zedong created a Soviet-Chinese alliance that eventually slid into hostility in the 1960s.</p>
<p class="nitfp">"Relations between Russia and China have reached their highest level ever," Putin said at the start of talks Tuesday.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Hu arrived in the Russian capital on Monday and met with Putin at the Russian leader's Novo-Ogaryovo residence outside Moscow - an informal setting Putin said emphasized their "personal relationship."</p>
<p class="nitfp">Putin already has had several meetings with Hu, the last in December.</p>
<p class="nitfp">China has strongly for a pipeline to bring crude oil from Angarsk in eastern Siberia to the Chinese city of Daqing. Russia, however, is considering a rival, Japanese-backed proposal to the Russian port of Nakhodka on the Sea of Japan.</p>
<p class="nitfp">The Russian government has sought to satisfy both China and Japan by offering a compromise that would build the pipeline to Nakhodka with an extension to Daqing.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Putin was noncommittal on the projects Tuesday, saying experts should discuss the routes.</p>
<p class="nitfp">In Tuesday's joint declaration, China also supported for Russia's bid to join the World Trade Organization.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Later this week, the two leaders will take part in a Moscow summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a six-nation group that also includes four ex-Soviet Central Asian republics. Hu is also scheduled to attend weekend festivities marking the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg, Russia's former imperial capital.</p>
