Sunday (Sep 30), I was surprised by it being my turn to select a place 
to<br>go. We quickly decided the best use of our time would be to get 
Millay<br>leveled to 49, and we hustled over to the City of Mist to make this 
happen.<br>Paldaan, Millay, Gitt, Tennyson and Dunnan were present for the 
festivities.<br>It turned out to be a big leveling night as Millay (49), 
Tennyson (51) and<br>Gitt (41) leveled.<br><br>On Tuesday night (Oct 2), I at 
least had an inkling as to what I wanted to<br>do. I had been drooling over an 
Onyxbrand for as long as I can remember<br>(well, as long as Dunnan can 
remember) Shortly after logging on, we all<br>popped into Crystal Caverns to 
take care of this short quest for Dunnan.<br>Coleridge, Millay, Gitt, Dunnan, 
Gruffydd, Manelin, and a new friend,<br>Seeldar were present for taking out 
the Ghost of Burneal. After Gruffy,<br>Millay and Gitt buffed everyone, 
Manelin handed in the book and we began<br>dispatching the ghost. Heh, you 
know the ending - Dunnan has now been seen<br>brandishing this new weapon all 
over Velious! Thanks everyone!<br><br>We then headed over to Velketor's 
Labyrinth for the remainder of the evening<br>for some experience gathering. 
We dispatched a number of blizzard spiders,<br>shard spiders as well as a 
crystalline devour and a crystalline statue<br>before calling it a night. 
Dunnan dinged (41)!

Tuesday we went up against Shardwurms in the hopes of&nbsp;getting some biles 
for the&nbsp;shawl quest.&nbsp; We walked out with&nbsp;1 bile, one flayed

For Sunday night we went to Velketor's Labyrinth (sp?) for the first time as a 
group.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tennyson, Gruffydd,&nbsp;Millay, Coleridge and Paldaan (from 
Spirit Guardians) setup behind the bottom of the ramp on the right side of the 
first floor.&nbsp; Things went well except for one death for our puller 
(Coleridge) and some inconsiderate pullers who did not keep track of where 
their mobs were going.&nbsp; Later we were joined by Jarre from Amnesty.&nbsp; 
We collected some silk threads and made about 7 blue bubs of experience, 
resulting in a level for Tennyson (50) and Millay (48).&nbsp; Tuesday we're 
headed into the Shardwurm Caves to gather some bile and a piece from the 
Phenocryst's Focus quest.&nbsp;

Wednesday we did something a bit different - instead of doing one of regular 
hunt we joined in on a Vox raid.&nbsp; Here's Millay's comments:
<p>
i have mixed feelings about it. negative first: the usual complaint about it 
taking SO long to get going. hell, we buffed naltron symbol (with peridots at 
10pp a pop) so early that some people's were dropping by the time we finally 
went in to Vox's lair. i was unhappy to begin with because the raid organizer 
had forgotten or overlooked me and didn't even assign me to a group to begin 
with, but stuck me in the 'leftovers' group, with a druid, shaman, and a 
couple of casters. (this was Gruff's group too...FP didn't seem to be high on 
the preference list this time). then i found out that Paldaan's group had 4 
tanks and no healer, so i asked Cade to switch me, which he was very nice 
about doing. there were also just too many people. if he'd been smart, he 
would have closed the raid when it hit about 35-40 in the zone instead of 
waiting for 53 people to say it was closed. of course, there were still 
expected people who hadn't arrived yet, so the total number was 60. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>otoh, with that many people, it was fairly easy to kill Vox. my 
group had the tasher, who died right away mainly because i couldn't get him 
targetted, in spite of my hotkey. i thought at first i'd been boneheaded 
enough to spell his name wrong, but afterwards realized that he was simply too 
far away, even though i dind't have trouble targetting anyone else and 
everyone was pretty much in the same place. i am proud to say that no one else 
in my group died. the total carnage was only about 10, so not 
bad.<br>&nbsp;<br>on the postive side, it was impressive to see vox for the 
first time. her wingspan is huge. i took quite a bit of damage and got most of 
my buffs dispelled, but never got feared or incapacitated. also, my group did 
the most damage so we got experience for the kill. that gained me half an 
orange bub!<br>&nbsp;<br>finally, the loot was disappointing. the best items 
were a couple of cleric hammers with not such great stats considering they 
dropped from a named dragon. but, i won the first roll and walked away with a 
hammer.<br>&nbsp;<br>was it worth it. i'm still not sure. from all accounts, 
it went very well, so i'm glad of that. was it time well invested? half an 
orange bub for 6 hours isn't shabby. would i do it again? i don't know. 
probably, but i'd like to go with a slightly smaller group.<br>

Once again we (Col, Gruff, Kera, Mill, Tenn, and Pal) had planned to once 
again head to the seventh floor of the Tower of Frozen Shadows and once it 
again it was camped (by the same people even!).&nbsp; Plan B was Karnor's 
Castle so off we went...
<p>
We get in, do a camp check, mull around for a bit, and end up in RCY.&nbsp; 
Things were pretty fast &amp; furious with constant pulls, several with up to 
four mobs which were squeakers.&nbsp; Eventually we either got a pull of six 
or a pull of four with some backspawn, Tenn went down despite frantic healing 
by both Millay and myself, and the rest of us evaced (with everybody stunning 
like mad to get the mobs of me).
<p>
We regrouped, got Tenn rezed, and started clearing the area from the bridge to 
the courtyard.&nbsp; Millay went ahead (we had invised and her see-invis 
dropped - she thought we had already left for RCY again).&nbsp; We got her 
rezed and started again.&nbsp; Then Coleridge got killed somehow - I think we 
just weren't paying attention to what we were doing.&nbsp; 
<p>
Finally we got our act together and took over the Captain camp.&nbsp; We did 
real well there with constant, small pulls.&nbsp; Unfortunately it was fairly 
late so we couldn't stay long and never saw the Captain.
<p>
Coleridge dinged 48.

Last Wednsday it was off to the tower of Frozen Shadow again to test ourselves 
against the seventh and final floor.&nbsp; Unfortunately it was camped 
(mysteriously - the campers kept logging in and out and in and out, 
hmmmmmm).&nbsp; So we cranked the exp on the sixth floor some.&nbsp; Toward 
the end of the evening Vhal popped and we jumped in and downed him easily 
(Cole managed to pull him without the batfriends).&nbsp; We cleaned out all of 
6b and decided that what the heck, we'll at least go look around.
<p>
We let the campers know we're just going to have a peek and head up to 
seventh.&nbsp; After cleaning out all the junk up to Tserrina's room we 
discover our campers are missing!&nbsp; hmmmmm....&nbsp;&nbsp; We explored a 
bit in the upper reaches of the tower and on the way back to T's place Cole 
tells us tp jump off the stairs to avoid agro'ing unnecessary mobs.&nbsp; 
Manelin thinks he's kidding and goes the long way around and sure enough, 
agro's a bunch of mobs.&nbsp; No problem, more experience for us.
<p>
Shortly after that Manelin went link dead.&nbsp; We waiting around for about 
half an hour but he wasn't able to get back on and since by this time it was 
really late we were forced to leave.&nbsp; Manelin apparently got back on 
later and decided to just his chances and try to gate before dieing - and 
guess what happened?&nbsp; Oh well, maybe next time the dufus will let us 
rescue him :)

We bid adieu to Paldaan the other day as he moved on to Spirit 
Guardians.&nbsp; I'm sure we're not completely rid of him yet though :)

Sunday night we had a pretty good adventure as we attempted to conquer the 
upper reaches of the Tower of Frozen Shadow. Coleridge, Paldaan, Gruffydd, 
Millay, Tennyson and Manelin were present for the outing. It was my first trip 
beyond the third level, so while I picked the poison the only thing I could 
have led us to would have been our doom. Coleridge and Paldaan 
graciously&nbsp;picked up the lead spots.
<p>
If I learned nothing else in Burning&nbsp;Woods,&nbsp;I learned&nbsp;it's 
helpful to follow someone else to keep the group together. Upon porting to 
Iceclad, I followed Tennyson, and he got us lost at sea, but we evenutally 
made it to the Tower. My invisibility down, I was beset upon by a number of 
shadow guardians giving me my allocated&nbsp;death for the 
evening.&nbsp;Cumulative lessons learned: 1) Follow someone, 2) Don't follow 
Millay while swimming, and 3) Don't follow Tennyson when it's snowing.
<p>
We moved swiftly through the lower&nbsp;reaches of the tower and didn't stop 
until we reached the 4th floor. Here Cara got smacked around as we made our 
way through, and Nosja dropped the Ceremonial Wedding Sword as the wedding 
party was dispatched on the 5th floor. A number of ice shades and shadowguards 
had to be dealth with on the 6th before ValSera surrendered to us twice. We 
didn't attempt to wander up the ramp to the other portions of the 6th floor. 
The goal was to get additional keys for safekeeping in the bank. Now we have 
two additional keys to the 7th&nbsp;floor. The last pull of ValSera 
was&nbsp;tough and we had to evac after killing ValSera - everyone was oom and 
there&nbsp;were three enshrouded bats left.
<p>
After the evacuation, we decided to head over to Crystal Caverns to complete 
the Onyxbrand quest. We moved swiftly down and into the terror room, cleared 
it out and anticipated the moment Paldaan would hand the book to the Historian 
to spawn the Ghost of Burnael. He spawned, a dwarvish looking ghost 
(lvl&nbsp;51), and he fought bravely before surrendering his Onyxbrand to 
Coleridge. Yay Coleridge! And in the words of Kerawack, there was rejoicing 
and a good time was had by all......&nbsp;

Finally, after enduring connectivity problems for an hour right as we were 
getting started, we payed a visit on the Froglock King.&nbsp; We invised to 
the noble room, cleared that out, and then our noble warrior started 
pulling.&nbsp; The Huge Elemental room was cleared without particular effort 
and we moved in and started pulled the king-prep room.&nbsp; The first pull 
was middling-huge and included two boks, a guk, miscellaneous shamans, and the 
shaman pets.&nbsp; We perserved though and after a rousing good fight we stood 
triumphant over the field of battle.&nbsp; After a brief rest we finished 
after the stragglers from the area, moved in, and eyed the king room.
<p>
The king room had three visible shaman - one a guk.&nbsp; Since there is no 
place to go but in and single pulling probably wouldn't happen, there is only 
one possible choice of action, CHARGE!&nbsp; Another good fight later and 
Furor Poeticus has officially conquered Lower Guk!
<p>
Thing settled into the usual routine after that with us pulling all the way 
back to the Huge Elemental room.&nbsp; On the final spawn of the night the 
King finally showed himself and we promptly give him a taste of our 
displeasure at being made to wait.&nbsp; We had little difficulty but in our 
arrogance failed to properly notice the arrival of his Tactician.&nbsp; Our 
poor cleric died incredibly quickly but yours truely stepped in and kept 
everybody together until we were ready to reaquaint Millay with her corpse.
<p>
For our efforts we were rewarded with a Crown of the Froglock Kings, a Black 
Tome With Silver Runes, and a ding for Tennyson (49), and Millay (47).

We started out Sunday by taking another crack at the Dark Elf Corruptor for 
the druid/ranger epic.&nbsp; We lined up, I did my thing, the DE popped, we 
engaged the corruptor, and Tenn dropped instantly to a double&nbsp;harm 
touch&nbsp;from the reavers.&nbsp; Unduanted, the rest of us continued to dump 
on the Corruptor with everything we had.&nbsp; Despite several of us getting 
feared (he had an uncanny ability to fear just as the fearless discipline wore 
off apparently) we dropped him and I looted a few seconds before the reavers 
finished off the druids.&nbsp; Thanks guys, I'm now several steps further 
along on my epic!
<p>
The plan after that had been to pay a call on the Froglock King in Lower Guk 
but he was apparently entertaining guests already.&nbsp; So we just went off 
to the City of Mist to soak in some experience.&nbsp; We set up camp at the 
gazebos just outside the Reaver room and pulled steadily all night.&nbsp; Both 
Coleridge and I dinged 47 before the night was done.

Kedge was changed to 6th floor of ToFS since I thought it would be easier to 
do with only 5 of us showing up, plus Gruff had mentioned he planned on Kedge 
soon.&nbsp; We opted to pass on ToFS however and did Trak's Teeth, killing 
Silvermane, a bunch of hunters/foragers, and Trak Rex(?) who unfortunately did 
not drop the rogue dagger; there was much rejoicing though and a good time was 
had by all.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenn got the components for his Sebelis keys I believe; 
there was also much rejoicing and a good time was had by all.&nbsp; Oh yeah, 
Gruff gave his virtual life in the TRex battle; there was still&nbsp;much 
rejoicing and a good time was had by&nbsp;all those that lived.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Fall slowly turned into a harsh&nbsp;winter and we had to eat the monks to 
survive; there was much rejoicing and...yeah, yeah...

Sunday - Well we were without our Enchanter again for the whole week, but I 
wanted to give Karnage Castle a good old college try...
<p>
We were short people but I want to welcome 2 people that we have FINALLY made 
part of our family.&nbsp; Manelin and Orestes can often be seen kickin' it 
with the FP crew and we've now made them a permanent part of Furor 
Poeticus.&nbsp; Welcome to our nightmare!&nbsp; j/k.&nbsp; See the new added 
screenshots for the new "evil" side of FP.
<p>
Anyway, back to KC.&nbsp; I gathered everyone and decided to make a run at the 
right courtyard area of Karnage Castle.&nbsp; We got in with no problems and 
everyone started getting ready...I pulled one room pop and things were going 
fine..&nbsp; Well someone trained the left courtyard, who in turn trained us, 
and although Gruffydd made a valiant attempt, he went down faster than 
Tennyson with Trakanon on him trying to evac us.&nbsp; Train to zone, we ran 
out.&nbsp; Millay ressed Gruffydd and I decided it would be a safe night in 
Trakanon's Teeth.&nbsp; Many a forager and hunter fell to our swift blades 
and....um...colorful spell thingies that those finger wagglers do..but alas, 
no named spawns to be found.&nbsp; No one else died, except a level 60 Shaman 
that proceeded to buff us to the hilt...woot!
<p>
Tuesday - CAN YOU PLEASE MOVE OUT OF THE TUNNEL SO THE FAT ASS BARBARIAN CAN 
GET INTO SOLB!?&nbsp; Some people are so inconsiderate, it's hard being big, 
those elves never listen and won't let me into the bigger dungeons, I think 
it's a conspiracy!&nbsp; They won't let me into the North Freeport bank 
either!
<p>
After clearing everyone else's trains, we slowly made our way to the stone 
spider room in SolB and got a nice BCP for Sadornn.&nbsp; We did bats and bugs 
the whole night and there was much experience gained by all.
<p>
Wednesday - More SOLB!&nbsp; Took longer to get going this time, and this time 
we picked up a 42 Ranger and brought him along since Kerawack was AWOL.&nbsp; 
Stone spider room can get exciting at times, the bats and bugs seem to jump 
you when you least expect it.&nbsp; We did a great job of root parking though 
and Manelin only died once!&nbsp; It was great to have him along though, he 
was a great spider magnet and often I did not even have to pull!!&nbsp; Oh, 
and I dinged 46, finally.

Tuesday night was the "Great Server Outage of '01" where half the servers, 
including our beloved Saryrn, were barraged by network problems.&nbsp; Most of 
our City of Mist group got one blue bub Tuesday and four blues on our followup 
Wednesday.&nbsp; We left a little early due to a train including an army 
behemoth - frantic chain stuns and an expert evac got us all out of there in

Last Sunday was an awesome night in the City of Mist.&nbsp; We decided to move 
into the middle third, near the "Goo room".&nbsp; After one accidental sky 
pull from the right side of the goo room we evac'd, regrouped, and camped the 
left side instead without much incident.&nbsp; Some mobs were even to 45 but 
all died very efficiently.&nbsp; I myself netted 8 blue bubs of xp and 
everyone else in the group reported similar gains.&nbsp; We had 3 levels for

I played Millay to give us a better group, and was joined by Cole, Kera, and 
Gruff.&nbsp; We popped over to KC and joined up with a 49 Pally (Danar) and a 
45 Chanter (Katho).&nbsp; We camped the LC and just mowed down everything that 
moved.&nbsp; We&nbsp;got a couple of Jarsath Gauntlet drops, but nothing much 
in the way of loot except for a Kunzar cloak that Gruff won the roll on!&nbsp;

Well, Tuesday night was kind of a mess.&nbsp; The only FP people present were 
myself and Coleridge.&nbsp; We had Manelin and Orestes joining us, but no 
Cleric, Druid, or Enchanter.&nbsp; M &amp; O brought a couple of their 
friends, a 45 Druid and a 37 Pally, and after meeting up in DL we decided to 
brave the likes of KC...&nbsp; It didn't work very well.&nbsp; We set up in 
Right Corner, and just didn't have a way to deal with many heals or multiple 
pulls.&nbsp; Cole died once, and Orestes also did.&nbsp; Our group makeup just 
wasn't there.&nbsp; We basically had 5 tanks and an offensive semi-healing 
caster...&nbsp; We'll get them next time :-)

Faulkner is going on a much-needed sabatical to..um..return to EverFrost and 
continue his shamanic studies on the complicated social/genetic causes of the 
much dreaded "Tainted Wooly Mammoth syndrome".&nbsp; Just how does a wooly 
mammoth become tainted?? or even corrupt?&nbsp; Does it accept bribes from ice 
goblins? Faulkner has had a burning need to answer these questions since his

It was a beautiful Sunday night...&nbsp; As we casually&nbsp;strolled through 
WC and met at the druid ring, none of us knew what to expect...
<p>
Except Coleridge, of course :-)&nbsp; Myself, Millay, Gruffydd, Kerawack, and 
Coleridge took a quick evac to Emerald Jungle, and quickly zoned into 
Trakanon's Teeth for a night of hunting hunters, foragers, and whatever else 
might cross our paths.&nbsp; &nbsp;After sorting out who could kill what and 
who had laid claim to the spawn cycle, we quickly proceeded to pull a named 
spawn.&nbsp; I don't remember his name, but he was a nasty BITCH!&nbsp; Even 
to me at level 50, it took about all we had to kill him.&nbsp; We were 
rewarded with an Iksar Hide mask, and it was time to get down to 
business.&nbsp; The forager seemed to spawn near our camp site, so in about 15 
minutes we had killed a forager for everyone in the party.&nbsp; The hunters 
spanwed quite a bit away, but the joys of tracking allowed us to take down 4 
of those relatively easy, with the fifth drawing a crowd of 3 adds.&nbsp; I 
kited and zoned while the rest of the party finished off our last hunter, and 
in under an hour and a half we had all the components for our Sebilis 
keys.&nbsp; So, we proceeded to the Emperor and turned in our newfound 
treasures, and we now have five keys to the ruined castle.&nbsp; Alas, it was 
an early night since people had company and weren't feeling well, but the 
primary mission was accomplished in record time.&nbsp; All hail the tracker!!!

Wednesday:<br>Once again, the Hole was camped, so six of us (no Faulkner again 
tonight) headed to the Tower of Frozen Shadows to conquer the 6th floor. This 
was challenging because no maps exist of this floor. At least there were 
helpful text guides from adventurers who went before us so we had a good idea 
of what to watch out for. We killed icy shades for a couple of hours before we 
got Val Shera to spawn.
<p>
The night didn't go smoothly, though: there was a lot of downtime from server 
crashes and linkdeaths. We finally got to the room where Val Shera was and 
pulled him.&nbsp; He came with several bats (all blue to us, but tough 
buggers), which Tennyson did an admirable job of keeping mezzed so that we 
could focus on Val. Paldaan got charmed and when charm wore off, he couldn't 
attack. He had to camp out and come back again, which lost valuable damage 
output on the mob. It was a very difficult fight, the most challenge we've had 
in a long time.
<p>
Our warrior managed to resist being feared for the entire fight. Way to go, 
Cole!&nbsp; I'm sure Soulfire was a big asset in this fight too. We were all 
out of mana, had used LoH, and the tanks were on their last bubble of health 
by the time we killed Shera. we looted quickly and evac'd, not a second too 
soon, with the cleric crossing her fingers that the ranger's fraction of life 
would last through the port. All we got for our trouble was a key to the 7th 
floor (whoo hoo!) and a rather pathetic talisman.
<p>
This floor has 2 parts: to the left is where the ice shade spawns, which has 
to be killed to cause the keyholder (Val Shera) to spawn. He spawns in a room 
to the right, through a one-way mirror. The shades aggro through the floor, 
though, so if they haven't been cleared, they'll swarm while you're trying to 
kill the keyholder. The best strategy is to take 2 groups (or split in 2 
groups, if everyone is high enough) and have one group clearing the bottom 
floor and looking for the PH while the other keeps the upstairs cleared in 
preparation for the keyholder spawn. We're rather proud of the fact that we 
did it with a single group of 44-50.<br>

Tuesday: We ended up not doing the Hole tonight as it was already camped at 
the entrance. instead, we did the soulfire quest for Kera. All were present, 
including Manelin and Orestes, except Faulkner, and we logged him on to be a 
backup healer. he did a few buffs, stood and watched, mostly, and healed 
Paldaan once or twice. he wasn't even grouped. but now, his faction with 
Freeport Militia can't possibly get any worse. sorry about that. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>Millay's faction also plummeted to KoS. she should have zoned 
before Sir Lucan died (like Paldaan did) instead of listening to Cole who 
swore she wouldn't take a faction hit from just healing 
:)<br>&nbsp;<br>Killing Sir Lucan went amazingly smoothly (the hardest part 
was trying to get Lucan to stay put out at the edge of the zone...he persisted 
in running around killing rats and snakes!). Paldaan pulled him to the far 
wall in West Freeport and zoned out. We hailed Lucan while the rest of the 
guards returned to their posts, then killed him without a problem. We had a 
small crowd watching and cheering us on as we destroyed the leader of the 
corrupt Freeport milita. His skeleton spawned, we quickly dispatched that, and 
Kera looted his quest item.
<p>
Then we went to Paw to turn in the item and get the sword. it was funny to 
waltz in and have everything be green. the last time we went there, we spent 
more time zoning out than killing stuff!&nbsp; we went and killed ishva too, 
since we were there, and got a necro spell for our trouble. <br>

The Golem Incident(s)
<p>
We finally decided we were bad-ass enough to venture into the Hole and get 
some&nbsp;of that great&nbsp;exp down there.&nbsp;&nbsp;we called upon our 
good friends Manelin and Orestes to join us, which they naively agreed to, 
since we were missing our paladin. We assembled,&nbsp;created an alt to buy a 
key and be the doorperson, and headed in.
<p>
The entryway was already camped so we boldy took off down the hall. Silly us. 
We were beset immediately by 3 elementals. 4 people died before the elementals 
were subdued. Then we did corpse recovery. In the middle of rezzing corpses, 
the other group trained us with a golem&nbsp;and an elemental so it was gate 
time and one more death. *sigh* 
<p>
At this point, there was some discussion as to whether to abandon&nbsp;the 
Hole and just go do something safer. (Even with a 50% rez and a 25% group 
experience bonus, we were sitting at a 25% exp deficit.) But we said, No, 
we're Furor Poeticus! and regrouped. One of the zone campers left so we 
assimilated the other, a 44 paladin, and then had 9 people total. That worked 
pretty well and we merrily slaughtered elementals and an occassional golem. 
Boy, those things are tough though!
<p>
Millay levelled to 45 and then our new paladin friend levelled too, and 
promptly disappeared. Once again, the fight was much tougher. Paldaan did an 
overpull and took the fall for us once at the hands of a golem, and&nbsp;again 
later&nbsp;we were beset by a golem right after finishing one off, with 
everyone out of mana. A couple deaths that time too. 
<p>
All in all, it was Golems 8, Furor Poeticus 5. We're going back in for a 
rematch on Tuesday though!

I find it ironic that I joined a regular group in order to avoid doing 
outdoor, pick-up group type encounters, yet last night we killed giants in 
Great Divide for almost 3 hours.&nbsp; With only 4 people showing up though, 
there's not much we could do about it.<br>Not much to report...Kera dinged 46

It was a dark and stormy night...&nbsp; OK, no it wasnt.&nbsp; With Kera being 
out, it turned into Paldaan's night out.&nbsp; I had gotten a burnt sash while 
trying to take out Naggy, so I had all the components needed for my Call of 
Flames spell.&nbsp; We ported over to EK, buffed up, and spawned Vance 
Bearstalker.&nbsp; He's a 53 mob, but melee only, and after a long fight we 
took him down with everyone still near full health.&nbsp; So, I scribed my 
brand new spell, and we went off to Velious.
<p>
We decided to go to Wakening Lands, so those of us with teeth ported over, and 
Faulk, Millay, and Cole all ran through Kael (successfully) and obtained their 
WL teeth!&nbsp; That run through Kael certainly is a lot more fun when people 
don't die...&nbsp; So, Millay camped out, and the rest of us proceeded to kill 
Tigeraptors and the occasional other mob..&nbsp; After an hour of that, Cole 
Dinged 44 (WOOT!) and that was that...

was dubious so he didn't need invis in SS but Tennx was KOS.&nbsp; My favorite

Well last night didn't exactly go as planned...
<p>
I'd convinced myself that we could take out the Dark Elf Corruptor for the 
druid/ranger quest.&nbsp; So we got together in EK, went over the plan a 
couple times, buffed the $$^T@# out of ourselves, and went to it.&nbsp; I ran 
around to activate the spawn and then met up with everybody at the camp 
spot.&nbsp; A minute or so later the Corruptor and his two Reavers 
spawn.&nbsp; We engaged the Corruptor and Faulkner started kiting the Reavers 
as per-plan.&nbsp; The Corruptor wasn't particularly tough and we were beating 
him down good.&nbsp; We got him down to less than a sliver when *poof* he 
despawned - apparently the Reavers got tired of chasing Faulk and went and 
killed the druids without Faulk noticing.&nbsp; Oh well, nothing lost but the 
time it will take to get the coin to spawn him again.&nbsp; Next time we'll 
just mez.
<p>
After bitching a bit we headed off for Guk again - this time to see how far we 
could push into the King area.&nbsp; We got there and crawled our way to the 
noble room and there's another group there starting to push in 
themselves.&nbsp; So we just spent the evening doing the Crusader one more 
time.&nbsp; He never did spawn although we got another Priest and even got the 
Noble once.

Sunday we were in Lower Guk to have a conversation with the Froglock Crusader 
in hopes of convincing him to give up his tunic. 
<p>
On the way in Cole's invis dropped right outside the Patriarch room. We agrod 
about three instantly and started to take them down, and got some more adds, 
and some more, and some more, and some more, and, well you get the idea. I 
think Tenn had 5+ on deck for five minutes straight and Cole and Kera weren't 
taking taking their time killing stuff. The pile of dead mobs was waist deep 
and took up about three-barbarian lengths worth of hallway when we were done. 
Quite some fun!&nbsp; We then stopped at the EE and picked up a new bag for 
Tenn (he gave his old one to Tennx). We need to get another for Kera also.
<p>
The bunker break went smooth although I'm glad I've been there before so I 
could tell Cole what to expect. The crusader only popped once and droped a 
sword (Runed Falchion? - his common drop). Never saw the priest.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Tenn dinged 46 and I dinged 45. I got about four blues of hell exp for the 
night. The Wan's greened out for Tenn after he dinged but we were mostly 
fighting zols so it shouldn't have been to bad.

Wednesday we spent the evening at the Ry'Gorr fort with the hopes of bopping 
Firebrand the Black a few times.&nbsp; We got there and had the whole place to 
ourselves.&nbsp; After a few easy pulls Paldaan pulled the Chief and two 
elites.&nbsp; We weren't really prepared for it and the Chief is much tougher 
than he cons so we end up with all the tanks dieing and the casters getting 
evaced out at the last moment.
<p>
We pulled ourselves together, got back, rezzed the tanks, started pulling 
again and soon noticed that a high level druid was grabbing all the elites and 
the other inner fortress mobs without even so much as a "thanks for clearing 
the trash" to us.&nbsp; After a few rounds of trying to pull fast enough to 
get some elites of our own we decided to just move in to the fortress 
itself.&nbsp; We took over Firebrand's room and basically hung out all night 
killing the two or three mobs that spawn in there and the mystics just outside 
while farmers took the chief room and the rest of the fort.&nbsp; Firebrand 
only popped once (the last pop of the night for us) and dropped the gloves 
which Kera is now wearing.

Well our fearless leader (Coleridge) was AWOL last night and Kera and Tennyson 
were out as well.&nbsp; However Manelin and Orestes were around so we were 
able to muster a full group to go after the Lord.&nbsp; Those deepwater aqua 
goblins spawn fast and we got unexpected adds quite often.&nbsp; On one 
occasion we ended up with four.&nbsp; Manelin got agrod and despite me chain 
healing he gave one up for the group.&nbsp; The rest of us managed to squeak 
it out and finish the off.&nbsp; A while later the same thing happened but 
this time it was Orestes on the chopping block.
<p>
After all that the Bergurgle was to timid to show himself.&nbsp; We did get 
the Corrupted Aquagoblin Shaman for the druid epic however so the night wasn't 
a total loss.&nbsp; We all agreed that we'd give the goblins a rest and come 
back after we've forgotten what a long camp it is...

Kunark's more little-known dungeons.&nbsp; We started off pulling the zone in 
area and then moved farther in.&nbsp; A bad pull forced an Evac and we 
ran&nbsp;back to the&nbsp;City again after gathering ourselves again.
<p>
We then proceeded in a bit further and pulled Golems, Skeletons, Appartitions, 
and Shadows.&nbsp; The Captain of the Guard showed up but he doesn't drop 
anything "phat".&nbsp; Not much was really challenging but then again we did 
not go in that far either.&nbsp; Great experience SHOULD have been obtained by 
all.&nbsp; Coleridge is now 42, I think that was the only ding for the

Ahhhh, Wednesday.&nbsp; We had a big turnout with myself, Kerawack, Gruffydd, 
Millay, Faulkner, Coleridge, Manelin, and Orestes there the whole night.&nbsp; 
Tennyson had link problems and was only there off and on.&nbsp; We started by 
crawling to the Guardians.&nbsp; I believe on our fourth kill, we got the 
elusive Celestial Healing spell!&nbsp; Only two more levels til Millay 
can&nbsp;scribe and cast it!&nbsp; After getting what we came for, we moved to 
the crystalline wurms in the back of the caves.&nbsp; They are arranged in a 
huge room with a total of four spanws spread out nicely.&nbsp; We just did the 
spawns in a circle, and by the time we finished the fourth the first had 
respawned.&nbsp; We got several 50 spells, including ones for Faulkner and 
Kerawack, and then were done for the night.&nbsp; Not a big XP night, but the 
addition of Celestial Healing makes the last two days more than worth it.

Tuesday...&nbsp; I decided to hunt shardwurms in Great Divide in hopes of 
securing Celestial Healing for Millay, and was joined by Gruffydd, Faulkner, 
Coleridge, Millay, and Tennyson.&nbsp;We&nbsp;began by killing ancients and 
elders near the entrance to the tunnels, then moved into the Guardians.&nbsp; 
We dropped about 10 Guardians and obtained an assortment of spells, but none 
were Celestial Healing.&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn't too exciting of a night, but I 
think everyone learned a bit about the wurms and their habitat.

There we were....&nbsp; In the Tower of Frozen Shadows...&nbsp; We decided to 
take the 4th floor and get some more keys.&nbsp; Upon breezing our way through 
the first three levels, we found one of the named spawns up on the&nbsp;4th 
floor, Cara Omica, a very ugly hag.&nbsp; After taking her down in fairly 
short order, we proceeded to lay waste to everything on the East side of the 
floor.&nbsp; After 3 hours or so, we finally got the keyholder to pop, and we 
now have two keys to the fifth floor.&nbsp; We ended the night with two 
embalmer's knives from Cara, a SK-only shield from another named spawn, a 
decent necklace, and the final key.&nbsp; It was a slash and burn kind of 
night, with only Cole not quite making it back from a long pull and 
needing&nbsp;one of Millay's new 50% rezzes...&nbsp; Tuesday night will be

Tuesday night was another foray into the Tower of Frozen Shadows. Tennyson was 
still on another continent and Paldaan was feeling under the weather, so the 
rest of us were joined by the lovely and talented Orestes, a magician of the 
40th level. We'd hoped to take out the angry librarian again for some nice 
loot on our way through the second floor, but it was heavily camped so we went 
straight to the 3rd&nbsp;floor. We killed off all the&nbsp;zombie maids and 
shadowbeast servants until we&nbsp;enraged the Shadow Beast Lord, whom we also 
made short work of. Then we proceeded to the 4th floor for some cursory 
investigation. 
<p>
This floor looks to be&nbsp;not much&nbsp;more challenging than the previous 
two, although the Shadows are rather ornery for being nothing at all. No 
exciting loot, no exciting experience, but no mishaps either. We're&nbsp;ready 
and eager to&nbsp;conquer the 4th floor tonight.&nbsp;

Only 4 of us were able to meet on Sunday night (Gruff, Cole, Faulk, and 
Millay) so we hesitated to go to the Tower of Frozen Shadows as we'd planned. 
Instead, we headed off to Rathe Mtns to help Faulk with an item for his epic 
weapon quest, which was&nbsp;quickly accomplished.
<p>
That done, we decided to try for Millay's first item in her quest, which 
involved swimming to an underwater cave in Lake Rathe and killing Lord 
Bergurgle. According to all we'd heard, it should have been easy enough for a 
group of&nbsp; 4 40's to take him out. Alas, he was guarded by deepwater 
goblins, some of which could cast heal. We'd use up all our resources on just 
2 of them and not have enough to go after the Lord, and by the time we were 
ready, they'd respawned. Kedge Keep was good practice for this place! We 
decided we'd come back another day when we had more resources and headed off 
to Eastern Wastes to slaughter snow griffins.
<p>
There were no snow griffins to be found, though, so we settled for merely 
getting experience at the Rygorr fort. After an hour, Kera arrived so we felt 
brave enough to try the Tower. We had nothing to fear: we went to the 2nd 
floor, cleared it in short order (half the spawn is green to us now), got the 
Angry Librarian to spawn and drop the Student's Homework and a key to the 3rd 
floor (giving the group its second key). Fearlessly (ok, not fearlessly, we 
were nervous), we made our way to the 3rd floor. Much to our suprise, even 
though all the mobs here conned blue to us, it was easier work than the 2nd 
floor had been when it was all blue. We found the Enraged Shadow Beast three 
times, for 3 keys to the 4th floor and a lovely war/sk/nec no-drop scythe that 
turned out to be useable only by evil races. Gruffydd, Faulkner, and Coleridge 
all leveled so it turned out to be a very productive night, in spite of being 
short-handed.
<p>
Tuesday we return to the Tower to take on the more challenging fourth floor.

Not much to say about it.&nbsp; We came, we saw, we camped.&nbsp; Phat lewt 
included some diamond earrings from Lasna Charoon and I think that's about 
it.&nbsp; Higher level people (42+) got exp about 50% of the time while the 
lower level players got exp for every kill so it helped us to even out our

We started with just Millay, Kerawack, Paldaan, and myself. We decided that it 
might be a bit ambitious to take on Droga with just four so we headed over to 
the lake to see if the Chancellor was up and maybe get the other half of our 
Howling Stone's keys. He wasn't but we moved in and beat on greenies for a 
while anyway.
<p>
Faulkner eventually showed up and we decided to have a go at Droga after all. 
We got together at the entrance and headed in. We did fine until we got to the 
dining hall (Pal was able to single pull almost every time) but then after a 
few pulls *something* happened and we had to evac with ten or so goblins on 
us. Millay made it out with half a bubble of life (after getting a LoH from 
Kera) and Kera wasn't far behind her. Pal at 44 only got experience from one 
mob. Kera said he was getting exp from maybe one in five so it's clear we 
started Droga'ing a little late. Oh well, no shroud for me.
<p>
After putting ourselves back together Millay logged and Tenn (who showed up 
right before we evac'd from Droga) joined us. We ported over to Velious to 
have a little Snow Griffon hunt. That went quite well and I netted three of 
the four eggs needed for the third shawl quest. It was a fun romp and a nice 
way to end the day on an upbeat after the earlier lackluster efforts.

Faulkner dinged in Droga someplace.

Tuesday we finally made it to Droga.
<p>
It was your pretty standard hunt for the most part. We crawled in and set up 
camp on the edge of the dining hall. The goblins are thick as fleas so we were 
never short on targets. Three warders showed in the two hours we were at that 
location but no shroud. Although there were a lot of greenies Gruff got almost 
a bubble of hell so I've changed my tone a bit and decided that the exp is 
fair-to-middling. Three or four levels ago and it would have been incredible.
<p>
On the way out we rushed a bit and didn't clear all the nooks and cranies as 
we went so we ended up evacing. Not a big deal. 
<p>
With Tenn out it should be fairly exciting so I'm talking us back one more 
time. Tanks should meet at your favorite druid ring for the port to DL and run 
to Droga. Casters can tag along or gate directly back. Remember that our bind 
spot isn't the safest place in the world...&nbsp;

Well last Sunday we had planned to go to Droga but since Xalgoz was free we 
hung out some more in Kaesora instead.&nbsp; We were a bit short because of the 
holiday but Tennyson, Kerawack, Millay, Paldaan, and myself.&nbsp; We were 
enough however.&nbsp; We crawled down to Xalgoz's lair, cleared the area, and 
dropped him for another fang.&nbsp; We were looking forward to getting our 
last two quickly and maybe getting moved over to Droga early but of course the 
next two spawns we're placeholders.&nbsp; Paldaan had been up all day and was 
about ready to drop but held out for just one last spawn and this time Xalgoz 
popped and dropped the last two fangs we needed!&nbsp; Now all of Furor 
Poeticus has fangs.

The full Furor Poeticus crew showed up for another jaunt in Kaesora.&nbsp; We 
also had Manelin and Orestes for 9 person raid.
<p>
Once again high level campers were keeping Xalgoz occupied so we split into 
two groups (Coleridge, Paldaan, Tennyson, Millay, Gruffydd) and (Kerawack, 
Faulkner, Manelin, Orestes).&nbsp; Manelin and Orestes were hot for a shot at 
a spirit tome so Kera took them to the library while the rest of us went to 
our favorite intersection near the tower to wait our turn at Xalgoz.
<p>
Both groups did really well for most of the night.&nbsp; Eventually the high 
levels moved on and both groups got together for a little more Xalgoz 
action.&nbsp; We managed to get him twice and got three more fangs before 
hanging it up for the night.

Another good night in Kaesora.&nbsp; The interesting twist is that we had 7 
people - Myself, Tenn, Pal, Cole, Mill, and our friends Orestes and 
Manelin.&nbsp; We decided to split the tanks, healers, and nukers between two 
groups and Tenn stayed under the watchful eye of Millay (that makes group1: 
Paldaan, Millay, Tennyson, Manelin and group2: Coleridge, Gruffydd, Orestes 
for those of you keeping score).&nbsp; The multi-group thing worked fairly 
well and I think the exp was split fairly evenly.&nbsp; If we pulled two Cole 
and Pal would split them and each group would take down one.&nbsp; For singles 
it was luck of the kill.
<p>
The original plan was to spend the night in church listening to the sweet 
sermons of Xalgoz.&nbsp; Unfortunately he was camped so we basically hung out 
at the entrance to the tower area with Cole pulling from one direction and Pal 
from the other.&nbsp; We finally were able to take over the camp near the end 
of the night and got Xalgoz once with the key component going to me.&nbsp; One 
down, 8 more to go (counting Man and Ores).
<p>
Loot consisted of a really nice 2hs and maybe one or two other things.

After a long run and&nbsp;a few wrong turns we arrived&nbsp;at the 
entrace.&nbsp; There's a long steep passage&nbsp;that dives down into the 
dungeon.&nbsp; It's&nbsp;obviously intended to be crawled with many drops that 
make passages one-way.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cole took us for the basic tour - once 
around the block from the entrace through a few drops and back again then we 
headed for the library area.&nbsp; We pulled the library, moved in, crawled 
back out, and generally poked around a bit before finding a cozy wide spot in 
the road next to the library for camping.&nbsp; We netted a Spirit Tome for 
Gruff (204 wis with Insight - WooHoo!), a truesilver bracer, and some cloak 
with nice resists but otherwise not worth much.

We'll be heading to the church area to hunt down Xalgoz in future raids.

Kael can suck.&nbsp; Big time.
<p>
It started with me, Cole, Kera, Gruff, Faulk, and Tennyson attempting a mad 
dash through Kael with visions of Wakening Lands dancing in our heads..&nbsp; 
It didn't quite work out as planned.&nbsp; Tenny got popped about halfway 
through, and my invis broke about halfway through and I made it all the way to 
the last couple of giants before my red bar disappeared.&nbsp; I think Cole 
died doing CR on the 2 corpses.&nbsp; Unfortunately no Clerics were available, 
so we attempted to run to our corpses, with Tenny taking a wrong turn 
somewhere along the way and giving the Giants yet another tasty snack to munch 
on...&nbsp; 
<p>
About an hour or more after starting our evening we had 5 of 6 across, and we 
decided to venture into WL and check it out.&nbsp; We cautiously moved North 
along the zone wall looking for our goal for the evening:&nbsp; Tigeraptors 
and Tigersaurous.&nbsp; There is a static spawn of 3 or 4 a ways in from the 
zone, so we set up camp and pulled those and wanderers in the forest.&nbsp; 
The Tigeraptors are pertty easy, and the Tigersaurous' are quite a bit more 
difficult, though they were no match for our party.&nbsp; We probably killed 
15-20 and ended up with several hides and Tigeraptor meats.&nbsp; 
Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in getting the guts part of the Ice forged 
shackles quest, so we will need to revisit another day.&nbsp; I attempted to 
pull one Hologresh (an elemental) but was somewhat relieved to outrun him back 
to camp as he unloaded several DD spells onto me.&nbsp; We'll need MR items 
when we hunt them to finish the 2nd half of the shackles quest...
<p>
It was a long and disappointing night, but I think we learned quite a bit 
about WL.&nbsp; I think this is a place we'll be visiting quite a bit in the 
mid-40's, but until we have getting through Kael perfected, it just isn't a 
whole lot of fun.

Short summary, short on time.
<p>
We met up with some new friends, Manelin and&nbsp;Orestes, and soon made our 
way to the Queen room in Crystal Caverns.&nbsp; Split up into two groups, 
broke the&nbsp;Queen room, and&nbsp;killed her two more times after 
that.&nbsp; Manelin and Orestes both leveled and there was&nbsp;much 
rejoicing.&nbsp; Watch out for Dr00d ninja looters, especially those named 
Saik (I don't care if you were camping her before we got there, you weren't 
there when we got there and we got the kill, that's ninja looting).&nbsp; 
Queen left us with a Messenger of the&nbsp;Queen,&nbsp;a Crytsalline Robes, 
and a Sceptre of the Coldain Ancients for the Kromrif Military Leggings 
quest.&nbsp; We'll see you all Tuesday.&nbsp;

Well another interesting Sunday night.&nbsp; Furor Poeticus, filled with 
new-found confidence and a full group, heads to Mistmoore in search of the 
evil Shadow Knight Xicotl.&nbsp; When will we ever learn? 
<p>
Everyone was a hero last night, we never found Xicotl but laid waste to many 
of the Mistmoore inhabitants.&nbsp; Special thanks to Kerawack, Paldaan, and 
Faulkner, for sticking it out in the hottub area even when the Enchanter and 
the Cleric were down.&nbsp; Special thanks to Tennyson and Millay for giving 
their lives for the group (again..Coleridge hangs his head in shame).&nbsp; 
Extra special thanks to Naldar, Dargin, and friends, its hard to find people 
of honor in this game, I salute you.&nbsp; Honorable mention to Coleridge for 
sparing his group a wipeout.&nbsp; Coleridge, Kerawack, and Millay leveled, 
and Tennyson is not far behind.&nbsp; Faulkner is still in 35 but at least we 
kept ya alive last night buddy!&nbsp; 
<p>
I have some shots of Garton Viswin and Ill send them to Gruffydd.&nbsp; I 
have a great shot of when he actually keels over, but who wants that stupid 
pike anyway.&nbsp; I was surprised to see him, my sources say he does not 
spawn there, but you learn something new every night.&nbsp; &nbsp;
