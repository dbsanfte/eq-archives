We went to the Tower again, got a 2nd key for the 2nd floor after ONLY 70 
minutes. we pulled like crazy on the 2nd floor, killed the&nbsp;Librarian 3 
times but never got the Angry Librarian to spawn, so still&nbsp; no 3rd floor 
key.

Coleridge has been wanting to take us to the Tower of Frozen&nbsp;Shadows for 
a while and since Tenn and Faulk we're both out this seemed like a good time 
to&nbsp;go collect keys on the easier levels.
<p>
We actually started out on time (woohoo!), ported over to Iceclad, and started 
running.&nbsp; Unfortunately Cole forgot to mention that you had to click on 
the zone to activate it and Millay, with a train of a half dozen or so snow 
dervishes on her, died trying to&nbsp;enter.&nbsp; Once that was cleared up we 
headed in and set up camp at the zone-in point.&nbsp; We then camped,&nbsp;and 
camped, and camped, and spent two hours killing greenies and <i>very</i> low 
blues&nbsp;until the keyholder (a Large Undead Gnoll) finally showed up.&nbsp; 
Millay was afk at the time so I grabbed the key before it could poof.
<p>
We then threw caution to the wind and decided that we had to get some exp that 
night so we headed up to the second floor despite not having a second 
key.&nbsp; This went a lot better exp-wise with most of the mobs ranging from 
low to medium blue with the teacher being even to me.&nbsp; Every mob on the 
second floor is a caster but we stayed fully buffed and Pal was able to single 
pull most of the time so we didn't have any problems.&nbsp; The Angry 
Librarian (key holder for the third floor key) never showed so we've still got 
a lot of key gathering to do.

Things started out with Paldaan and Millay (with her&nbsp;newbie&nbsp;troll 
alt) playing around in the swamp while waiting for Lygunda(?) to show her 
lovely face.&nbsp; Everybody was pretty much ready to hang it up and go have 
dinner before the&nbsp;actual game when she&nbsp;arrives.&nbsp; 16 rubies 
later Paldaan has a new Ivandyr's Hoop.&nbsp; To celebrate his success the 
servers crashed shortly afterwords.
<p>
About an hour later or so they came back up.&nbsp; Millay, Tennyson, Kerawack, 
and myself were on and since it was late already we decided to check out Guk 
again and put off Crystal Caverns some more.&nbsp; We get there but&nbsp;noone 
is really answering camp checks so we went exploring.&nbsp; We ended up 
setting up shop in the Savant room.&nbsp; Things went well for most of the 
night.&nbsp; We picked up a necro to help round out the group (our old friend 
E&lt;mumble&gt; from Cazic) and had fairly steady pulls athough between us, 
the ass/sup group, and the sage/exe group things did get a bit thin at times.
<p>
At the end of the night things fell apart.&nbsp; It started innocently enough 
with Kera pulling two.&nbsp; I got one one mad at me by thorning Kera and 
while standing there waiting for Tenn to mez it off he goes linkdead.&nbsp; 
Things quickly went downhill from there.&nbsp; Right after Tenn disappears the 
room respawned so now there's six.&nbsp; Kera calls for an evac but I can't 
get one off since I've still got the original frog on me.&nbsp; Kera&nbsp;was 
ghoul rooted and couldn't attack or taunt it so Millay started throwing stuns 
and in desperation heals to try to get it off me.&nbsp; Finally she succeeds 
but dies about 2 seconds before the evac finally goes off.&nbsp; As we're 
sitting there in Butcher getting ready to head back Tenn relogs into a fully 
spawned room and dies.
<p>
The experience was pretty good although since they were in post-hell both Tenn 
and Millay lost&nbsp;most everything with thier deaths.&nbsp;&nbsp;I dinged to 
37 (finally).&nbsp;

Well it was about a 50/50 evening.&nbsp; We did ok once we got setup, but we 
got are backsides kicked getting there.
<p>
The original plan was to head back to CC for some spider hunting.&nbsp; My DSL 
was acting up though so I didn't get on until to late and the group had 
decided to do LGuk instead.&nbsp; Tenn found the sage room uncamped (with the 
sage there even).&nbsp; The rest of us all met up at the zone, IVU'd, and 
headed in.&nbsp; Paldaan and Coleridge went ahead.&nbsp; Millay got turned 
around and ended up going the wrong direction from the river.&nbsp; I went 
back for her but by the time she got near the bedroom she was drowning.&nbsp; 
I stupidly tried to heal her and agrod the whole BR on me and died.&nbsp; Mill 
made it back out ok and Faulk ended up gating out.
<p>
Meanwhile, back at the sage, the three of them apparently decided they didn't 
need a healer to take the room and promptly got wiped out.
<p>
Fortunately for us a cleric took pity on us (Heal was his name) and rezed the 
whole bunch.&nbsp; The Fab Three hung out in the sage room while Millay and I 
made another run in.&nbsp; This time we got as far as the bridge but 
apparently we agrod the wizards behind it when jumping down and didn't know it 
until a minute or so later when we were burned into the ground while Cole and 
Pal stood there wondering what was going on.&nbsp; But hey, at least our 
corpses were close this time.&nbsp; Tenn got managed to get Mill to sage in 
once piece afterwords and she revived me.
<p>
We buffed up to the hilt, charged, and took down the room with no 
problems.&nbsp; A bit later we started pulling the exe and the first time Tenn 
got ganked early on but we managed to finish them off without him.
<p>
Once both exe and sage were broken life was really easy and things went 
ok.&nbsp; We ended up with some Braided Cinch Cords but paid for them with 8 
deaths total for the night..

It was a pretty nice Sunday night in EQ-land.&nbsp; Myself, Tenny, Cole, Kera, 
and Faulk started out making the run to Guk.&nbsp; We took out the Nokta 
Shaman (no globe, dangit) and then hit the dead side.&nbsp; We invised through 
most of it, dropped over to the live side, made our way to the EE spawn point, 
and hung out for the rest of the night.&nbsp; It was mostly uneventful until 
ANOTHER (is this our fourth time???) shaman pet brought himself and all of his 
mino and froggy friends.&nbsp; We were able to finish them, though Faulkner 
died in the process (Thanks, Heal, for the 50% rez!).&nbsp; I think we've been 
slaughtered once in the Patriarch area because of the shaman pet, once in the 
jail, almost once last night, and got evac'd out the first time we ran into 
him before we had the chance to get slaughtered (Thanks to Kera's Lay of Hands 
on Tenny while he was in the purple)...&nbsp; That little doggie is definitely 
the most dangerous part of that side of the zone!&nbsp; Gruff joined us about 
halfway through the night, and we got three EE bags.&nbsp; We stayed for one 
more spawn and got a fourth!&nbsp; Gruff brought his alt over to pick it up, 
so we now have an EE bag for everyone in the group, plus an extra.&nbsp; Happy 
days!&nbsp;

An awesome evening.&nbsp; We started out with myself, Millay, Paldaan, 
Kerawack, and Coleridge.&nbsp; We got organized just in time to head to the 
queen after some farmers got done with it.&nbsp; We marched down the spider 
hall very quickly and got to the entrace to the queen room.&nbsp; It was fully 
populated so we pulled it by having Mill, Kera, and myself root one mob each 
so we would end up with *only* four.&nbsp; It was a good fight and we got one 
or two before root broke, got a couple more, got some backspawn, and basically 
kicked a lot of spider butt continuously for quite some time.&nbsp; We ended 
up all low on mana and health but the room was broken.
<p>
We were pretty conservative in pulling since we didn't have any real crowd 
control but the spawn time is pretty fast so we kept busy.&nbsp; Faulkner 
joined us after a bit - he actually showed up just in time to help save us the 
first time the queen spawned.&nbsp; The queen showed up three times.&nbsp; She 
was a tough fight but we took her down and got a Crystalline Robe, a 
Crystallized Blade, and two Messenger's of the Queen.&nbsp; We also took down 
some of the lesser minions and got the two-handed version of the Crystallized 
Blade (*very* nice).&nbsp; After all was said and done I ended up with 3 
stacks of crystal swatches ready to be burned through once I get my tailoring 
a couple points higher.
<p>
I got 2.5 bubbles of experience for the night.&nbsp; I'm back to about where I 
was before the three deaths on Tuesday.

The smell of sweet success...&nbsp; After Tuesday's meltdown, we had all 
camped in the dwarven Coldain city.&nbsp; Kera and Gruff invised and levitated 
down the shaft to avoid having to crawl to the bottom of the Caverns.&nbsp; 
The Queen room was camped as we were gathering, but was vacated as we were 
clearing the broken bridge room.&nbsp; Myself, Gruff, Kera, Millay, and 
Cole&nbsp;broke the Queen room which luckily was absent the queen.&nbsp; It 
was a hard fought battle with little crowd control.&nbsp; I would say 8 or 9 
Crystal Spiders and Velious Crawlers&nbsp;were slain in succession before the 
room was broken.
<p>
After establishing our beach-head, we attempted to meditate and regain our 
composure.&nbsp; Faulkner soon joined us&nbsp;after a leisurely stroll down 
the now-cleared hallway, and we had a full group of 6 ready to do 
battle.&nbsp; The spawns were fast and furious at times with as many as 7 or 8 
spawns back-to-back.&nbsp; Our first Queen encouter was quite an experience 
(she is one of the ugliest Queens I've ever seen!) and she has a tremendous 
amount of hit points.&nbsp; By the time we had finished her the first time I 
believe 3 or 4 more spiders had spawned.&nbsp; It is a risky and dangerous 
area, but ultimately we looted three sceptres for the Kromrif Military 
Leggings quest,&nbsp;a Crystalline Robe, and two Messengers of the 
Queen.&nbsp; Two other high-level spiders spawned, and dropped a nice 2HS, and 
a very nice 1HS Pally/Shadow Knight&nbsp;13/31 sword.&nbsp; Alas, Kera's 
Ghoulbane is superior to this 1HS, but it was a surprisingly nice item 
none-the-less.&nbsp; We spent several hours in the room with a total of three 
Queen spawns (and one Queen swimming halfway back to the city in the canals as 
no one could get their snare to stick with Coleridge gasping for air upon 
surfacing after the chase).&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;Queen was able to do some sort 
of a harm touch on me during our second encounter which&nbsp;drained at least 
two full bubbles of hp's, but she only did this&nbsp;during the second 
encounter and not at any other time.&nbsp; Finally, Gruff collected almost 
four full stacks of&nbsp;Crystal Spider Silks to add to his collection of 
Tailoring skill-increasing possibilities. &nbsp;All in all a fantastic night 
from an xp and a loot perspective.&nbsp; The only downside is the feeling that 
we have conquered everything that the Crystal Caverns has to offer us.&nbsp; 
Maybe we'll try and aggro the whole zone one more time just create a bit more 
of a challenge...

Last Sunday, it was great.&nbsp; We went back to Crystal Caverns, 
quickmarch-crawled down to the bottom, and headed into the depths.&nbsp; There 
was a group in front of us pulling spiders to the geonid area so we hung a 
left and started taking down terrors.&nbsp; We had a few close calls but took 
the final room without to much trouble.&nbsp; By the end of the night we had 
taken out a particularly big terror (I forget what it was called) that dropped 
a nice spear I think.&nbsp; We also got a good set of crystal spider silk for 
me to burn trying to get my tailoring up.&nbsp; We also took down a Life Leach 
(another terror-boss type) but it didn't do us a favor and drop another BCR, 
instead we got some not particularly impressive whatever.&nbsp; The experience 
was very good.
<p>
We were hoping for a repeat on Tuesday but...

First off, Sunday night was great.&nbsp; Myself, Millay, Cole, Kera, and Gruff 
owned the Crystal Caverns.&nbsp; We crawled from top to bottom, and camped in 
the Stalag Terror room.&nbsp; We killed a couple of big mobs, and got a Stalag 
Terror Spine Speark (SK only) and a Chipped Velium Amulet.&nbsp; And we got a 
lot of xp.&nbsp; I dinged to 39, and Gruff dinged to 36.&nbsp; We camped out 
and planned to meet there again last night....
<p>
Last night....&nbsp; It started out with Gruff picking up myself and Faulk and 
porting to Iceclad.&nbsp; Once there we did the typical run to the bridge to 
EW.&nbsp; Once we zoned into EW we decided to wait for more people to get 
on.&nbsp; Well, someone trained a snow griff (even to me) to the zone, and 
since I had panic animal loaded, I decided to try and finish it off.&nbsp; 
Well...&nbsp; Snow Griffs have a damage shield on them apparently.&nbsp; I 
worked to snare/kite/dispel and finally got it off.&nbsp; Then it reappeared 
again.&nbsp; Damnit.&nbsp; When I loaded Dispel Magic I stupidly replaced 
Panic Animal.&nbsp; That would come back to haunt us.&nbsp; It broke fear and 
headed right for Gruff.&nbsp; I tried to taunt him off, but he finished G in 
short order.&nbsp; He knocked me down a couple of bubs while I tried to cast 
panic animal (HELLO!!!!&nbsp; That's DISPEL MAGIC you idiot!!!!) and in the 
panic of battle I didn't even realize I no longer had panic animal 
loaded.&nbsp; We soon zoned out, and a very nice Cleric (who we would meet 
again soon) did a 50% xp rez on Gruff...&nbsp; We then met Tenny outside of 
the Ry'Gorr fort as we waited for the rest of the group.&nbsp; I had 
originally set up a camp with Gruff off away from where everyone else was 
pulling, but after getting Faulk back with us and returning to the site, Tenny 
and G had moved to the hill straight out from the fort entrance.&nbsp; We sat 
there for a minute as I asked the group 'Wouldn't it be safer to camp a little 
further away?'.&nbsp; Not 5 seconds later, BOOM!&nbsp; Three or four Ry'Gorr 
Avengers (lvl 43-50) rained down on Tenny with a vengence.&nbsp; After 
quad-hitting him for 172, our favorite Enchanter was soon LOADING......&nbsp; 
PLEASE WAIT....&nbsp; Apparently the Avengers spawn then the Rygorr Chief is 
slain, and despawn after they've killed anyone who touched the Chief (or 
anyone who happens to be sitting in their path) and despawn as soon as those 
people either zone, quit, or are killed.&nbsp; I got up and ran as soon as 
they started in on him...&nbsp; So, Our favorite Cleric NOT named Millay 
rezzed Tenny with a 50% xp rez....&nbsp; Millay soon joined us, and we dove 
into the Crystal Caverns.
<p>
Cole joined us, and we figured we'd be bored doing the crawl thing since it 
was no challenge.&nbsp; Whoops.&nbsp; I saw some stairs leading down the hole, 
and decided to take them.&nbsp; Big whoops.&nbsp; The stairs mysteriously 
ended, and instead of putting me one level down, I ended up falling for 250hp 
of damage.&nbsp; Right in the middle of a Ry'Gorr party.&nbsp; As I got beat 
on, somehow Tenny mezzed, M healed, and Cole found his way down to me.&nbsp; 
Gruff also found his way down to me, as in the express fall route.&nbsp; As I 
tried to change from my dex gear to ac/tank gear, Gruff got mauled 
again.&nbsp; Two deaths for G.&nbsp; Cole and I finally spread the Ry'Gorr's 
out a bit and finished them, but Millay fell down even further than we 
had!&nbsp; To get a revive on Gruff's corpse, Tenny dragged it down to M by 
falling.&nbsp; Myself, Cole, and Faulk then decided to levitate down to the 
rest of our group.&nbsp; Whoops.&nbsp; I think we ended up aggroing the whole 
freaking zone.&nbsp; We were soon ambushed by 9 or 10 Ry'Gorrs, and just 
couldn't handle it.&nbsp; Gruff had just been revived, and didn't have the 
mana to do an evac.&nbsp; It was a total party wipeout....
<p>
Another group assisted in dragging our corpses near the Dwarf city, and we 
decided to call it a night....&nbsp; Tonight will hopefully be a much better 
time....

It was a dark and stormy night, and myself, Millay, Cole, Faulk, and Gruff 
killed every Sarnak in sight.....
<p>
We got out of the usual places and decided to venture over to Kunark.&nbsp; 
After some discussions we ported to DL and headed across the icy plains 
towards Overthere.&nbsp; After running across the continent, we set up camp 
just East of the zone to the Frontier Mountains, and started pulling.&nbsp; 
And pulling.&nbsp; And pulling.&nbsp; We spent several hours whacking anything 
that moved, Gruff and I both leveled, and we all got a nice tour of 
Kunark.&nbsp; And that was about it.&nbsp; No loot to speak of.&nbsp; No 
exciting monsters to kill.&nbsp; No deaths.&nbsp; We just whacked away.&nbsp; 
Lorax joined us towards the end of the evening, and much fun was had by all.

What started out as plans for Lower Guk or Crystal Caverns ended up as fun in 
South Ro.
<p>
We met at the WC ring and headed to Lower Guk.&nbsp; Tennyson had to leave 
shortly, and Gruffydd had to depart early before we got started.&nbsp; So, 
without an evacer and SoW'er, we decided maybe get lucky on the AC in South 
Ro?
<p>
Kerawack, Tennyson, Millay,&nbsp;Coleridge, and later, Faulkner, spent some 
time slaughtering greens in South Ro in an attempt to get the AC to 
spawn.&nbsp;&nbsp;He never did show,&nbsp;although we did take some Sand 
Giants.&nbsp; Tennyson and Faulkner had to leave, and we&nbsp;ended the night 
with a duel between Kerawack and Coleridge, with Millay calling the 
play-by-play.&nbsp; Paladins can be quite elusive with that Lay on Hands 
ability, but when Coleridge got dangerously low on health (after beating Kera 
down a SECOND time hehe), a&nbsp;Dry Bones jumped him and we ended the 
duel.&nbsp; No need to lose XP cause a skeleton takes those last few hit 
points off.&nbsp; We shall meet again Kerawack..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Time to hit MM again.&nbsp; We port in, buff up, and start running.&nbsp; 
First we stop at the cave above the chasm - everybody is there, everybodies 
invis is still up so we head up the ramp to the gate.&nbsp; Five there - we 
hit one and oops! theres&nbsp;eight now.&nbsp; It was a tough fight but we 
pulled it out.&nbsp; The casters medded up while the tanks picked off the 
occasional green wanderer and into the castle we go.
<p>
Wonder of wonders invis held again and we all made it safely to the Butler 
room.&nbsp; Clear butler, clear maid, and charge! into the kitchen.&nbsp; Kera 
took the double harm touch but we had him buffed to the hilt and runed as well 
so he only lost about two bubbles or so.&nbsp; Another cauldron drops and now 
Kera has both of them for the Ro breastplate quest.&nbsp; Expect to see him 
sporting new chest armor soon.
<p>
Fairly routine after that since everything is&nbsp;broken nicely.&nbsp; We 
held the place long enough to dispell any worries about anti-camp code on the 
cooks - they're just on a different (longer) timer than the rest of the castle 
for some reason.&nbsp; We managed to get a butler fang for Paldaan so he's 
probably going to want to do maid some more lol.&nbsp; We also got a 
nightshade wreathe for your's truely and dinged Faulkner to 34.&nbsp; Between 
Faulk's Imbue Ivory, Tenn's jewelcraft, and Pal's wheeling and dealing Furor 
Poeticus is making a mint on ivory jewelry.

Finally the Evil Eye in Lower Guk falls to Furor Poeticus!&nbsp; In fact we 
got the bugger four times!
<p>
Present were myself, Pal, Cole, Faulk, and Tennyson.&nbsp; After the usual 
herding of the cats we ported down to South Ro and hoofed it to Guk.&nbsp; I 
was dodging beggers the whole way so we hurried in while I informed them that 
they could have all the buffs they wanted if they met me in Lower Guk.&nbsp; 
After a brief detour for the regular taking down of the froglock priest (no 
rod this time) we went into dead side.&nbsp; After clearing most of the zone 
train we IVU'd and got as far as the bats before Faulk's invis dropped and we 
had to clear the bats and the BR.&nbsp; Then around the corner over the bridge 
to the gargs and wait, where's Faulkner?&nbsp; Turns out he fell off the 
bridge (not a good start for you there F...)&nbsp; By some miracle even though 
his IVU dropped again he wasn't immediately torn apart by frogs and Tenn was 
able to run down and get him.&nbsp; The rest of the gang amused ourselves by 
clearing the gargoyles as they spawned.
<p>
Then on to the live side.&nbsp; Everybody made it over the pit (hooray!) and 
we quickly jogged over to the EE spawn taking out a mino or two to loosten the 
muscles.&nbsp; After setting up camp at&nbsp;the EE's spawn point we decided 
to play it safe and wait for the first spawn so we waited, and waited, and 
waited.&nbsp; Eventually we started wondering about anti-camp or different 
timers for the EE.&nbsp; We pulled a few singles and we're starting to get 
antsy when pop! there's the EE.&nbsp; A good fight later and Tennyson was the 
happy owner of our first EE bag.&nbsp; After that it was the regular camping 
routine.&nbsp; It seemed like the EE spawned faster every time but we weren't 
complaining!
<p>
Cole made 35 in there someplace.

Are much hemming and hawing and running around we decided to split into two 
groups with Tenn, Mill, Pal, and myself in one, and Cole and Faulk in the 
other led by Timbre.&nbsp; Timbre took the others off to powerlevel a bit.

The rest of us headed down to Rathe Mountains and beat up Hill Giants.&nbsp; 
Pretty routine, exp and cash was decent, another bubble or so of hell down.

We had a nice relaxing at the Oasis last night.&nbsp; Myself, Millay, 
Coleridge, Faulkner, Gruffydd, and Kerawack did a little Spec hunting, and 
almost came through without needing any corpse recovery.
<p>
Cole and I began by getting the gift of levitation, and hit the island to 
scope out the situation.&nbsp; I found out that the specs have a VERY small 
aggro range, at least while they're just standing there.&nbsp; I have a lot of 
trouble harmonizing some mobs, but these were really easy.&nbsp; I would get 
one, run to the next corner, get it, and so on.&nbsp; When we pulled, it also 
looks like you're either going to bring the spec you hit, or the spec you hit 
and one of it's corresponding friends in the tower.&nbsp; I guess each outside 
spec has a pairing with an inside-the-tower spec, though sometimes they come 
together and sometimes they don't.&nbsp; Within the tower there is a small 
room at the bottom with a ladder to the top.&nbsp; Sometimes you get a pop at 
the base of the tower.&nbsp; Sometimes all 4 of them are at the top of the 
tower.&nbsp; Harmonizing the specs in the tower isn't really an option.&nbsp; 
Even if you could get the spell off on the ladder or somewhere else up there 
you wouldn't be able to see if it stuck or not.&nbsp; So, basically you climb 
the ladder and either get to the top or 3/4 of the way up before you aggro 
them.&nbsp; If you get to the top, you just run out the side and run straight 
for the shore with the specs in tow.&nbsp; If you get 3/4 of the way up and 
aggro, you get off the ladder and run back out the front door... 
<p>
<br>Pulling, snaring, and fearing worked AWESOME last night. I don't even 
really think we needed to snare them they move so&nbsp;slow...&nbsp; We began 
by pulling the 4 corners of the island, and we ended up aggro'ing one from the 
tower in that mix, possibly the first pull.&nbsp; After debating whether to 
pull the tower or not, we finally decided to try it.&nbsp; Well, I think that 
the first two we killed respawned while I was climbing the ladder, and instead 
of a manageable 3 Spec, I pulled 4 or 5.&nbsp; We still hadn't really 
perfected what to do if we pulled multiples, so we ended up pretty much duking 
it out with the lot of them.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Faulk became their primary 
target as myself, Kera, Cole, and Millay were finishing the first one off, and 
Faulk went down in short order.&nbsp; We killed one or two, and were forced to 
zone out.&nbsp; It seems like the Specs went right back to their places, and 
we soon zoned back in.&nbsp; Faulk's sacrifice was not in vain, however.&nbsp; 
After this the tower spawn was broken (another high level had charmed a Spec, 
thus preventing it from respawning in the tower) we were able to pull all 8 
specs since the spawn was nicely spaced out.&nbsp; We spent about 3 hours out 
there, and I got a full yellow bub of experience and around 45-50pp of loot in 
the process.&nbsp; I had a great time in taking out a little vengence for all 
of the times I had to run back from Freeport to loot my corpse after a run-in 
with the touch of death.&nbsp; I think we will return to the South shores of 
the Oasis again in the near future, and with a little better kiting and 
pulling technique and possibly the help of our soon-to-return Enchanter 
(though they do have a very high magical resistance, it seems) I think we 
could handle a 4-Spec pull quite easily.

Just another day in Paradise....

well, tonight would have been better spent taking a hot bath with a good book 
<p>
we met up at guk, recruited the dwarf warrior we met last night in Sol A when 
Kera left. nice guy, named Lexmier. turned out to be a high shcool student, 
but we didn't hold that against him. we headed in, stopping by to kill the 
priest for the rod of insidiuos glamor quest, and the notka shaman, who didn't 
drop the globe we needed. tonight, we went in to lguk a different way, so we 
ended up on the live side. we invised up to head to the EE area, but invis 
dropped in the jail. there were a couple of urd shamans, with their pets...you 
know what happened the last time we got jumped by urd shaman pets? well the 
same thing happened tonight. HP is dropping quickly, mana going just as fast, 
new mobs popping in. Gruff calls evac but gets killed before he can cast it. 
Millay followed seconds later, and before long, everyone was dead.
<p>
Corpse retrieval was a bit tricky, as Gruff needed to invis and pray that it 
didn't drop. we got the tanks out and revived, then headed in to the patr 
room, figuring we could clear out the area and pull the last 2 corpses there. 
Cole got Gruff's, but Millay's corpse was stuck behind some bars and he 
couldn't drag it out. meanwhile, he pulled a few minos and froggies to the 
patr room, and Millay died again. Lex needed to leave, so everyone gated out, 
except for Millay, who sat at the zone and waited for eveyone to return. 
<p>
while she was waiting, she met a lvl40 monk who was also doing CR. we offered 
to help him if he helped us, so he joined our group. name of Bargolin. his 
corpse was at the huge water elemental. We did our best to prepare for going 
in, but once again, got chased to the zone. Gruff decided to try a different 
approrach, by having Pal's alt go past the frogs, hoping a human who'd never 
been in guk would still have good faction, and pull Balgor's corpse out. 
Paldaan's lvl1 monk didin't have good enough faction wiht the dead frogs, 
though, so they ate him for dinner. a 50 cleric did a corpse retrieval on 
Millay for $50pp (the cost of the coffin). but he couldn't summon Bargolin's 
corpse because Bar needed to be standing there to target and he'd gone back in 
from the live side. it turns out that a couple 42~ guys showed up. they were 
looking for a group, tried to recruit Millay (while she was waiting for Gruff 
and Pal's monk to return). she did give one of them a revive and buffed 
everyone around the zone, then introduced them to Bargolin, and they went off 
to help him. we went off to go to bed, with not much to show for 3 hours.
<p>
but we did make a couple more new friends. Bargolin was VERY impressed with 
the way we stayed and helped a stranger. i told him it was good to culitvate 
friends , you never know when you'll need some. i think he'll be remembering 
us too.

SOl A here we come.
<p>
Tennyson is still out so we had the rest of us meet up in North Freeport and 
then ported to Lavastorm.&nbsp; Solusek's Eye was our goal for the evening.
<p>
Getting in was relatively easy, the campers were not too bad this 
evening.&nbsp; We proceeded to the King room and promptly dispatched 
everything on the way.&nbsp; No King.
<p>
We decide to travel to the bar, we get all the way there, laying waste to 
everything on the way, and the Bartender is being camped.&nbsp; Sigh.&nbsp; 
Well back and forth we go, having lot's of fun with the Solusek goblins.&nbsp; 
Eventually our camper left the Bar and we set up for the night.
<p>
After clearing the area we decided to pull the Jail and/or King to the 
bar.&nbsp; This went well for a while.&nbsp; Kerawack had to head out early so 
we recruited a warrior that was more than happy to join.&nbsp; The Bartender 
eventually showed and we got some Sleeves.&nbsp; We also had one nasty pull 
and ending up evacing, Faulkner had a sliver of life left.&nbsp; Those damn 
mages can pack a whollop.
<p>
We re-claimed our spot again.&nbsp; Paldaan ended up with 2 separate pieces he 
needs from Sol A so we're most likely done with there for a while.&nbsp; I 
leveled 34 and Faulkner leveled 33 I believe.&nbsp; All in all a great 
night.&nbsp; See you Monday.&nbsp;

A productive weekend!&nbsp; Saturday morning Paldaan, Millay, Kerawack, and I 
went to&nbsp;SolA to do a bit of questing for Pal's fire goblin heart (for the 
Ivy-etched sleaves) and maybe get a some Drake-Hide legs which had been on 
Tenn's wishlist for quite a while.&nbsp; We get there and no Inferno Wizards 
were up and&nbsp;the barroom was actually open (indeed, the four of us we're 
the only ones in the zone at times!) so we set up camp there.&nbsp; We had a 
few "interesting" times just getting there but eventually got the technique 
down (don't charge the barroom right off!).&nbsp; Kerawack had apparently gone 
a bit insane and started pulling from the king area - even the king room 
itself!&nbsp; At one time there were 10 goblin corpses on the ground.&nbsp; We 
made a good showing of it though and we're rewarded with the drake-hide legs 
for our troubles and Millay made 35.&nbsp; Unfortunately we never had a chance 
at getting the goblin heart.
<p>
Sunday evening I was feeling like some light entertainment instead of a 
hard-core hunt.&nbsp; Nobody objected so we went off to SolA again.&nbsp; At 
first we crawled around a bit taking the king area, the jail, and then trying 
for the bar.&nbsp; It turned out that the bar was being camped by a halfling 
though so we left it to him and took out the drunkard instead and then crawled 
around a bit more.&nbsp; While we were in the jail we found one of those 
elusive Inferno Wizards and this time he dropped a heart woohoo!&nbsp; After a 
bit the bar opened up so we started crawling back there, ran into *another* 
wizard and got a second heart!&nbsp; Once we got to the bar things settled 
down into a standard camp with us pulling from all over the goblin castle - 
mostly the king though&nbsp;yours truely pulled the torturer once!&nbsp; It 
was fun to get into the pulling groove for a while again.&nbsp; The torturer 
dropped a caster eyepatch.
<p>
Eventually Kerawack had to leave so we replaced him with a dwarven warrior 
(Lex-something).&nbsp; Shortly after Lex joined we got to impress him with our 
skill at bad pulls as we ended up with a nasty bunch of goblins&nbsp;including 
two mages and a shaman or two.&nbsp; We evac'd out at the last possible moment 
with all the casters oom and Faulkner under a bubble of health.&nbsp; I hadn't 
re-set up my hotkey to announce the evac so Faulk thought he had died - he was 
happy when he showed up in BB instead of his bind point!&nbsp; 
<p>
After medding up we headed back in and rebroke the bar.&nbsp; It was pretty 
late so we agreed that after the next round we'd call it a night.&nbsp; Our 
good luck held out for&nbsp;just a bit longer and both the bartender and the 
drunkard showed up to see us off with the bartender giving us a parting gift 
of some drake-hide sleeves and the drunkard a fire-crystal staff,

<p dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Once again it was off to Guk.&nbsp; 
Things started with me showing up late.&nbsp; Everybody else was there and 
either moving toward Guk or just getting started.&nbsp; Along the way Faulkner 
found somebody auctioning a nice weapon (what was it?) but didn't have quite 
enough money.&nbsp; We all (Faulkner, his seller, and I) met up at the 
Freeport bank and made the transaction and now Faulk sports a nifty new 
hammer.
<p>
<p dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Meanwhile back in Guk Paldaan spotted the 
Nokta on track so he and Coleridge start fighting their way back there.&nbsp; 
Millay was in Lower Guk finding out what was camped and what wasn't.&nbsp; 
Faulkner and I made to Guk, invised up, and start running toward Cole and Pal 
when we see them headed the other way.&nbsp; After stopping them we turned 
around again and headed toward the Nokta as a foursome.&nbsp; We make it there 
just in time to find some high-level wizard taking out the camp.&nbsp; 
Apparently the Nokta didn't drop anything though so it was no great loss other 
than time.
<p>
<p dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Finally we all get to Guk - just in time 
to wait for our druid buddy Lorax to finish getting there, wait, wait, 
wait...&nbsp; Ok, we're all there.
<p>
<p dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">The campers we're being particularly bad 
about replying to camp checks for some reason so we just head in to check 
things out.&nbsp; Unfortunately our favorite haunt (the ass/sup) was taken so 
I started to lead us over to the live side for some EE and/or elder action.
<p>
<p dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">We stopped just before the pit on the way 
to the Elder and I made sure everybody knew where it was and demonstrated how 
to jump over it.&nbsp; Inevitably somebody didn't make it and fell in so the 
rest of us all piled in as well just in case.&nbsp; It turned out that the pit 
was empty because a monk and a couple of his friends we're camping 
Raster.&nbsp; The monk actually me a Chrysoberyl Talisman for free (woohoo!) 
and we started moving toward the EE.&nbsp; Just past the elder room we ran 
into wandering mino and when we pulled him we got the two frogs near there as 
well.&nbsp; After that it gets a bit confusing but we apparently got several 
adds.&nbsp; Millay died quickly and I was unable to do anything because of two 
frogs that had decided to pick on the little guy so I soon followed.&nbsp; 
Aparently the calvery showed up right afterwords in the form of our friend the 
monk, his high-level cleric buddy, and one or two others.&nbsp; The whole gang 
was able to dispatch the mobs and Millay and I got resurrected (and the cleric 
refused any compensation).
<p>
<p dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Ok, with that behind us we moved on to 
the EE with no trouble and set up camp.&nbsp; Apparently somebody had just 
been by since there was a dead frog lieing there.&nbsp; We sent out Cole to 
pull us a couple and after a while we see "uhoh" followed by watching his life 
drain away as he got turned around inside the maze.&nbsp; I put on my corpse 
recovery hat and after a bit of searching found his body and pulled it back to 
Millay for a Revive.
<p>
<p dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Once that was taken care of Cole and I 
went out&nbsp;on a few joint searches for mobs.&nbsp; We did all right and 
pulled a couple and took out another EE placeholder.&nbsp; Eventually Paldaan 
spots the Ghoul Supplier on track.&nbsp; He was up for leaving immediately to 
go get it by I deferred saying that somebody else would get it before we got 
there.&nbsp; Several minutes later it was still up so I relented and off we 
went.
<p>
<p dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">We made it as far as the pit trap and had 
lots of jumping problems - I fell in twice (I've done that jump a thousand 
times I swear!) and by the time we all made it to the other side the supplier 
was gone.&nbsp; By this time it was pretty late and Lorax needed to leave 
anyway so we all just ported out.&nbsp; Once again we had no bags to show for 
our EE efforts.

Sunday night, we were missing a few (Tenn, Faulk, and Paldaan were all out), 
so we headed to LGuk and got found the Ass/Sup room empty. We recruited a 
druid, Lorax, to come along. We immediately set up camp. It went pretty well: 
We saw the Supplier once and the Assassin once. The Supplier dropped the TBB, 
which Cole has now. The Assassin dropped mask which we gave away to a Bard.
<p>
There were two battles that were touch and go. One in particular was 
*extremely* close. We had 2 zols and a vis and no crowd control other than 
snare/root. Gruff had to make "evac or heal" decisions several times in the 
fight (he chose to heal, fortunately!). The tanks all ended up with less than 
a bubble of health at the end of the fight as did our auxilary pickup druid. 
Ghoulbane paid for itself that time and we bet if it hadn't been there 
proc'ing we wouldn't have made it. The other battle pitted us against three 
wizards and we weren't really prepared for it. Again, it was very close. After 
that Kera kept EM up all the time and Gruff kept Resist Fire up so the next 
time we did all three wiz's at once it went much easier. No one died and we 
all got good exp.
<p>
We returned to LGuk on Monday (had to do a corpse retrieval on Millay anyway, 
who'd died there a couple of times in a pickup group after the rest of the 
guild left). Again, we found the Ass/Sup room empty and snagged it. Tenn and 
Kera were out, so we added a paladin, Helenna, as our 6th. (Ry'Gorr armor 
looks really good on female pallys! and she was carrying a wicked rib-bone 
shield too.) Except for one surprise death (Millay died as fast as...Millay 
with 3 wizzies casting on her), the night went smoothly. Gruff and Cole both 
levelled--no more book for Gruff! Congratulations, guys!
<p>
We didn't get a named spawn for 3 hours, even stayed a couple of extra spawns, 
until the Assassin finally popped, and he dropped another mask. We should port 
the rogues down and camp them there so they can get masks; this one just 
rotted. We DID get a bit of phat lewt, though, as Cole craftily pulled the 
savant from under the exe's room group. We scored a Black Enameled 
Breastplate, whoo hoo! 25AC. We've already decided to sell that, and the TBB 
from Monday, and invest in an FBSS. Paldaan's Weapon Analysis showed how much 
more damage the tanks will do with more haste as opposed to more strenght 
(Cole already has about 185str, how strong does a guy need to be, anyway? 
Maybe he can start giving Millay piggyback rides, since she's always 
encumbered.)
<p>
We all agreed the loot and exp is pretty good, so it's back to LGuk for 
Wednesday's adventuring.

Another first!&nbsp; Off to Velious!
<p>
Coleridge, Paldaan, Kerawack, Millay, Tennyson, and I ported into Iceclad and 
Cole started leading us to the bridge to the Eastern Wastes.&nbsp; Along the 
way we were repeatedly attacked by snow dervishes, dire wolves, etc, 
etc.&nbsp; Eventually we got tired of killing one, taking two steps, getting 
jumped again, and so on so we just ran for the bridge and zoned.
<p>
Our&nbsp;destination was the Crystal Caverns so once into the wastes we 
invised up and started running for the Ry'gorr fort.&nbsp; Of course invis 
dropped halfway there and we were jumped by the local wildlife but we just 
kept going.&nbsp; When we regrouped in front of the fort it turned out Kera 
had trained our new-found friends to&nbsp;some dwarf guards so we wouldn't 
have to run over the people at the fort.&nbsp; Once that was taken care of we 
re-invised and went to the back of the fort to activate the magic crystal that 
took us into the caverns themselves.
<p>
The caverns were brand new to all of us and the maps are very confusing so we 
just started crawling.&nbsp; It turned out that it's laid out great for 
crawling - mobs are spaced out nicely with few wanderers and no large 
groups.&nbsp; The named mobs also spawn randomly so you're not forced to camp 
if you don't want to.&nbsp; Anyway we got promptly lost and ended up at a dead 
end with some orc herbalist.&nbsp; Little did we know that he would drop a 
nice new weight reducing bag for Millay!&nbsp; After that Cole took charge and 
started leading us steadily downwords in a spiral around the central 
pit.&nbsp; Along the way we ran into another herbalist.&nbsp; We charged it 
excited about the prospect of a second bag but after defeating it we found 
that it didn't have one - but it did have the Blackened Crystaline Robe!&nbsp; 
A great new robe for Tennyson and an incredible find.
<p>
Soon after that we reached the bottom of the pit and with a little levitation 
help crossed a great chasm with a river at the bottom.&nbsp; On the other side 
was a lost dwarven town.&nbsp; The dwarves were dubious about having a bunch 
of adventurers wandering around thier town but put up with us anyway.&nbsp; 
After exploring a bit we decided to call it a night and ported back to 
Antonica.

Our first foray into Lower Guk!
<p>
Millay, Tenn, Pal, and I spent a while dinking around North Freeport waiting 
for Cole to show up.&nbsp; We finally gave up and ported to SRo and ran into 
Guk.&nbsp; Pal wanted to get a rod from the Preacher so we paid him a visit 
again but he was camped so we wandered down to the live side zone to setup for 
a foray into Lower Guk.&nbsp; About then both Cole and Kera (surprise!) show 
up.&nbsp; After a bit of confusion I ported out to WC, took Kera to SRo, met 
up with Cole in Upper, and guided everybody to the zone just in time to help 
take out a bunch of shins.
<p>
So into LGuk we go.&nbsp; It turns out our camp spot (the shin outpost near 
the zone) was taken so we push in a little further and took the Minotaur 
Patriarch camp.&nbsp; We did really well there and after a spawn cycle or two 
we decided to push on to the Evil Eye and maybe get a couple bags.&nbsp; We 
made it to the EE with no problems and a PH was up.&nbsp; During the fight 
with the placeholder a stray shaman pet showed up, and then a couple more 
frogs, and then a couple more, etc.&nbsp; Tenn started dropping fast (despite 
there being no hags around!) and Kera pulled off an amazing LoH just in time 
(Tenn was in the purple).&nbsp; We evac'd out.
<p>
After that we went back to Upper, got a rod from the priest and terrorized the 
shins some more for light entertainment since both Pal and Millay we're 
getting pretty tired.<br>

Unrest was much kinder than Mistmoore : ).&nbsp; &nbsp;We (Tennyson, Millay, 
Kerawack, Faulkner, Paldaan, and Gruffydd) got into Unrest and another low-mid 
30's group was just forming up so we high-tailed it down to the basement while 
the getting was good.&nbsp; While deciding whether or not to bypass the 
torture room somebody's invis dropped or something so the question was settled 
for us.
<p>
We then moved on to the ghost room.&nbsp; We advanced in nice easy stages 
taking stuff out one or two at a time until we got to the ghost room 
itself.&nbsp; The ghost was up so we charged in and took him down.&nbsp; We 
settled in for a night's camping whle Kera did an excellent job of 
pulling.&nbsp; The ghost was spawning like crazy (I think we only got a 
placeholder twice) and was very generous.&nbsp; We came out with 3 sets of 
Dwarven Work Boots!&nbsp; Kera now proudly wears a pair and 
Millay&nbsp;took&nbsp;a set&nbsp;also.
<p>
We got very nearly three bubbles of experience for the night.&nbsp; Kera 
dinged to 34 early on and Faulkner made 32 about halfway through.&nbsp; Gruff 
hit 34 on the final kill of the night for the group.
<p>
In after hours trading Tennyson was up 1 point to 34.

<p dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">After a couple of the usual missteps we 
actually made it back to the butler room in Mistmoore.&nbsp; We took out the 
butler with no problems and he dropped some neck piece that Tenn is now 
wearing (+7 MR and some other stuff).&nbsp; Then after clearing out some 
stragglers we pulled the maid room.&nbsp; We ended up with four but we're able 
to take them out without major problems.&nbsp; We then charged the kitchen.
<p>
<p dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">There are two cooks in the kitchen who 
are both SK's.&nbsp; They both HT'd Cole and dropped him to about half and 
from there things were pretty straightforward.&nbsp; We ended up with a 
cauldron for Kera's Ro quest.&nbsp; We also pulled the maid on the next 
respawn and she drops a nice headpiece (ac 1, wis 5, int 5) that&nbsp;again 
went to Tennyson&nbsp;has.
<p>
<p dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">After settling in we we're doing ok but 
then we had a runner, pulled 4-6 mobs onto us, and had to evac.&nbsp; So we 
ran back, suited up, and went in again.&nbsp; We made it to the cave without 
invis dropping so I suggested that we just head up and ignore the chasm 
mobs.&nbsp; We did this but instead of regrouping in front of the gates we all 
just went directly into the castle.&nbsp; Halfway to the secret cooridor 
sombodies invis dropped and next thing I know Cole and Paldaan were fighting 
stuff, Millay was in the corridor, and Kera had disappeared (later we found 
out he had started to head for the zone following our "if invis drops die and 
get rezed" rule from earlier).&nbsp; It turned out that we were able to 
dispatch the mobs without agroing the whole castle but Kera died just outside 
the castle.
<p>
<p dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Since Millay was inside (without invis I 
think) we just reinvised the main party and continued.&nbsp; We regrouped and 
charged the kitchen again.&nbsp; This time Cole died in the first second or 
two of battle - I have no idea what happened.&nbsp; Pal, Tenn, Millay, and I 
continued the fight with Cole getting rezed near the end.&nbsp; It was tough 
but the four of us were able to clear the kitchen.&nbsp; Another cauldron 
dropped but by the time we managed to catch our breath, med up, recover Kera's 
body, and rez him it was to late and the cauldron rotted just as 
Kera&nbsp;appeared.
<p>
<p dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">After a while it was clear that cooks 
weren't going to spawn again.&nbsp; I have debunked every anti-camp zone 
theory I've ever heard but I may have to become a believer.&nbsp; 
Unfortunately the butler and maid were being camped by a couple farmers so we 
couldn't go back there and let the kitchen respawn.&nbsp; After milling around 
a bit we had pretty much decided that maybe we can take the ambassador 
room.&nbsp; We grouped in the "safe corner" and were figuring out what to do 
when a wanderer came out of the room, agro'd on us, and pulled at least 10 
mobs down on us with the result being a total party wipeout.
<p>
<p dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Corpse recovery was a disaster for 
me.&nbsp; I was able to get Millay, Coleridge, and Kera out with no problems 
but then the cooks respawned.&nbsp; Three deaths later I finally figured that 
the cooks could see invis - either that or my luck was terrible - invis 
dropped 3/3 the second I stepped in the kitchen door.&nbsp; In the last 
attempt I managed to get Pal's corpse out of the kitchen before dieing so the 
next time I was able to retrieve it safely.&nbsp; A friendly rogue managed to 
get Tenn's (dieing in the process), and it turned out that my corpse had 
teleported to the zone although only Tenn could see it at first and I had to 
camp out.&nbsp; Coleridge managaged to sweet talk a cleric into coming to MM 
for some exp rezes.&nbsp; I think everybody except Millay got a 50% rez.&nbsp; 

<p>
<p dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Hmmm...&nbsp; I'm pretty sure I died 5 
times so I might have missed one in there.&nbsp; At any rate, I started the 
night at 2 bubbles.&nbsp; I was up to 3.5 when the wipeout happened, and ended 
up with 1.&nbsp; Sigh.

Last night was another typical night in the land of 
Poeticus.&nbsp;&nbsp;Myself, Cole, Gruff, Tenny, Faulk, and 
Millay&nbsp;completed several quest pieces (with myself being the primary 
beneficiary) and someone died.&nbsp; The first part is good, the last part, 
not.&nbsp; Our journey started in Mistmoore as everyone regrouped after Sunday 
night.&nbsp; Mistmoore was in the process of being overthrown by several 
guilds, so we decided to move on&nbsp;and tie up some loose ends.&nbsp; 
<p>
Our journey started in Steamfont at the Mino mines.&nbsp; Cole pulled Meldrath 
and his two mino guards, and they were quickly dispatched as Tenny had soon 
charmed one of the guards and turned him on his master.&nbsp; Suddenly, I was 
holding Meldrath's skull in the air, and half of the Ivy Etched Tunic quest 
had been completed.&nbsp; 
<p>
Next we ported to NK, and made the long trek to the Rathe Mountains.&nbsp; 
Almost immediately upon entering the mountains, Tarskuk, the evil cyclops, 
roared to attention.&nbsp; After quickly dispatching of him, I again held a 
skull in this air,&nbsp;this time looting&nbsp;Tarskuk's Cyclops charm as I 
finished the second half of the Ivy Etched Helm quest.&nbsp; Hurrah!&nbsp; 
<p>
We decided to trek to CT, our favorite haunt for some quick xp, to allow Gruff 
to make us some lizzy sandwiches.&nbsp; On the way we decided to rid the world 
of yet another undead creature, and swiftly removed one Spectre from the world 
of the living.&nbsp; Everything had been easy up to this point.&nbsp; Maybe a 
bit too easy...
<p>
As we entered CT, the Throne Room was open, so we quickly cleared the 
area.&nbsp; The final piece of my quest puzzle for the night, hulking gorilla 
hair, was quickly obtained.&nbsp; As we watched Millay model for us on the 
throne (I preferred her on the Iron Maiden myself) our boredom got the best of 
us.&nbsp; We decided to pull the upper floors of the throne area.&nbsp; 
Unfortunately, just as our battles started with the upper-levelers, our 
lower-level friends decided to return for a visit.&nbsp; Hopelessly 
outnumbered and in a state of confusion we killed off several of their ranks 
before the numbers became too overwhelming.&nbsp; As we evac'd to NK, Millay 
spent her last dying breath saving our lives, and was slain just moments 
before the rest of us were saved.&nbsp; Alas, we all hung our heads, as our 
thoughtful Cleric had again given her life for ours.&nbsp; After the 
non-binders among us journeyed back to CT, we extracted our revenge upon the 
evil Lizards, and conquered the Throne Room once again in Millay's honor.
<p>
Here ends the story, and another night in Antonica.

The Timbre Express takes us to Butcherblock and we meet up at Mistmoore.&nbsp; 
Many things happened last night, where do I start...
<p>
We reached the torture room without incident.&nbsp; It is called that due to 
the shackles on the wall and the Iron Maiden on the floor..did someone say 
Iron Maiden?!&nbsp; "Hear the Rime of the Ancient Mariner..".&nbsp; We 
dispatch the Deathly Ushers and the Will Sappers that certainly looked 
surprised to see us and then set up for the night.&nbsp; I proceeded to pull 
Gargoyles and the occasional &lt;insert random wandering Mistmoore goon 
here&gt;.&nbsp; 
<p>
Millay discovered that her armor does not deflect magic and she turned out to 
be the only casualty of the evening when she was nuked into the ground by 
a..well I dunno anymore but she went down faster than Tennyson with 
3&nbsp;Festering Hags casting on him.&nbsp; We did collect 4 pieces of 
Mistmoore Granite, and a Rune&nbsp;of Ivy for Paldaan.&nbsp;&nbsp;We&nbsp;had 
to run out once (where did THAT come from?), but&nbsp;I talked&nbsp;everyone 
into going in again for one more try, it proved to be worth it since we 
obtained our 4th piece of Granite.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
We also&nbsp;had a fun time killing one of the Teir'Dal from the camp in 
Lesser Faydark, some wonderful party or person decided that we would love to 
kill a 45 Cleric at the&nbsp;zone to Mistmoore.&nbsp; It was a long fight due 
to&nbsp;a bug where she was actually behind the zone to Mistmooore, but we 
could not reach her without arrows.&nbsp; We got her eventually, and there was 
much rejoicing, yeah...&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>

What started out to be another attempt to get Mistmoore granite and cauldrons 
for Kerawack's Ro armor, turned into a great night for quests.&nbsp; We 
arrived at Mistmoore with newfound confidence and determination, but alas, the 
Maid/Butler/Cooks/Gargoyles were all camped.&nbsp; We headed to the graveyard 
and&nbsp;setup for a&nbsp;quick run in to get Millay's&nbsp;Icon for her 
Caduceus of the Sacrament.&nbsp; The Icon was there, but unfortunately 
Gruffydd gave his life for this cause as the Jail residents were&nbsp;not very 
happy to see him.&nbsp; 
<p>
We then headed to the canyon area, but a brave party of adventurers had 
already cleared the area.&nbsp; There was no rejoicing.
<p>
Gruffydd airlines then took us all to North Karana.&nbsp; We then proceeded to 
find the occasional giant or two.&nbsp; Here is where it gets good.&nbsp; A 
little druid had wanted us to kill GrimFeather (yeah, right) and in the 
process of talking to him I discovered that he had killed Zahal the 
Vile.&nbsp; The time that he had done this put his next spawn very&nbsp;close, 
so I asked if we could at least check and see if Regis was up.&nbsp; On the 
way to his spawn point, someone shouted that Zahal the Vile was up...&nbsp; 
Run like the wind&nbsp;we have to get to Regis' spawn&nbsp;point.&nbsp; 
Inevitably, Zahal was killed by the guards just as we were arriving near 
Regis' spawn point.&nbsp; He showed his face and promptly died, giving up his 
Icon and the flute.&nbsp; Millay should have a new bracer soon.
<p>
Gruffydd then does some wonderful tracking and finds a Griffon, the first one 
that we have seen all night.&nbsp; We promptly dispatch it and it has a 
Griffon Eye.&nbsp; I am now the owner of some new Crafted Vambraces.&nbsp; We 
then head to West Commonlands and spent the rest of the night hunting Shadowed 
Men, Tennyson is now the owner of some new Incandescent Gloves.&nbsp; 
<p>
3 Quests completed in record time IMHO.&nbsp; We will get you your&nbsp;Ro 
armor Kera, I promise.

Welcome Paldaan!
<p>
With Kerawack on Wednesday we can also try going in past the jail area.&nbsp; 
If we can setup in the Torture room we can pull gargoyles which drop granite 
more frequently, and&nbsp;also possibly pull from the tower area.&nbsp; 
Chasm&nbsp;is fine with me too, though.&nbsp;

Monday night, we assembled in MistMoore again, this time mainly for the xp. 
And xp we got: every person playing leveled!&nbsp; Kera and Faulk were 
missing; Kera got on later and also leveled. Only poor Faulkner is still in 
hell, but we should be able to get him out of there by the end of Wednesday 
night. Because it's such good xp, we're heading back to the canyon for one 
more night of whacking gargoyles and ancilles.
<p>
We played it safe last night, stayed out of the castle. Only one scare, when 
someone (not one of us) pulled or aggro'd a couple of nasties on to us. Gruff 
kept his head and evac'd immediately and no one was the worse for wear. 
<p>
The high point of the night was officially adding Paldaan to the guild. 
Welcome, Pal, and well met!

Good news:&nbsp; The Mistmoore canyon was no match for Furor Poeticus!&nbsp; 
Even undermanned, we were able to make all those ancilles cry 'Uncle!' and 
somewhere far away some nice dragons are happier with us that we did so.&nbsp; 
Enynti was forced to give up her Rune of Fortune and there was much rejoicing 
(well, the 'chanter was happy, anyway - and has a great new mask and an INT of 
164).
<p>
Bad news:&nbsp; The trip from the canyon lip to the servant's quarters is, 
well, tricky.&nbsp; Our first attempt to herd six cats (err, players) to the 
secret hallway met with a Total Party Wipeout.&nbsp; After one of our rank was 
killed due to invis dropping, someone suggested evac for the rest of us and I 
said "Sure, definately!".&nbsp; We just forgot to get out of range of the bad 
guys before going vis again (and if we were out of range, we wouldn't have to 
evac, Q.E.D.).&nbsp; In our second attempt to sneak in a few at a time, 
Millay's invis dropped again in front of the Gyspy Room and they commenced to 
whale on her unmercifully.&nbsp; Faulkner although safe in the corridor, 
gated, leaving Coleridge, Kerawack and myself.&nbsp; Kerawack discovered quite 
by accident why Mistmoore walls have a reputation for being buggy - he went 
visible halfway sticking out of the secret wall and the baddies in the Gypsy 
room took that personally.&nbsp; Everyone lived through that except for, well, 
the 'chanter.&nbsp; After sticking some pins in his Kerawack doll he felt much 
better.
<p>
After this Furor Poeticus took out their frustration on the ancilles some 
more, hoping to get some Mistmoore Granite from the canyon gargoyles.&nbsp; 
With a level 54 puller who had some wicked swords, we were able to create 
quite a pile of dead Dark Elves.

so, Faulk, Tenn, and I were talking with Paldaan, trying to figure out what to
do for the night. Faulk needed to retrieve Rimbaud's corpse from lavastorm
(with naked Rim being in gfay).  then he immediately went LD. Millay headed to
lavastorm to wait for him there while Tenn and Pal went to highkeep to see if
we could kill raiders for some quick and easy xp.  
<p>
Meanwhile, over in highkeep, Pal and Tenn wrestled the raider room from a
greedy group that was holding both warrior and raider rooms. Millay and Cole
joined them soon afterwards, and easily held the room (it used to be so hard!)
it's not a good place for xp any more, we've pretty much outgrown highkeep. at
10, Kera/Tim logged on and we begged for a port to Tox so Millay could kill
Maugrim and get her cleric greaves.
<p>
After running every direction except the right way, we finally found Kerra
Ridge and the temple and killed Maugrim in about 2 seconds. Thanks to everyone
for their help on this quest!
<p>
While we were waiting for Tim to port us, who else shows up but Tikk. the whole
group made it on after all. Happy Valentine's Day!

It was off to Cazic again for us.  Just getting there proved to be something of
an adventure.  It started as usual with me, Millay, and Faulkner meeting up and
heading in the general direction of Cazic.  We had just gotten to the oasis
when Cole showed up.  He's at the WC druid ring so I gate back to sow him and
Millay and Faulk keep going to meet up with Paldaan in South Ro.  Cole and I
make to to North Ro when we start getting hints that the three of them had
decided to take on a Sand Giant.  Things did not go so well and Millay got
turned around and ended up dieing.  Sooooo I turn around again and met her at
the EC tunnel.  Sow up, and this time we make it to Cazic in one piece.
<p>
Originally we had planned on doing TR or gators.  The TR was camped but Millay
mentioned that she'd like a mudwater rune for her bard (which we did get I
believe) so we decided to do archon base (4 corners) instead.  We get there and
clear the first couple fine and then Faulkner and Coleridge started having a LD
contest.  Cole was the clear victor when he went LD on a pull, came back stuck
behind one of the pillers in the corners, and died logging back in (I give him
a 7 on style and a 9 on persistance).  Whilst waiting for Cole to log in again
for a revive (he went LD after dieing), we picked up a 32 necro (E&ltmumble&gt -
quite competent by a little *ahem* bossy).
<p>
Once everybody was back and formed up again we cleared the whole base and the
first level or two easily.  E suggested that we head up top.  It sounded good
to me so up we went.  After a bit of excitement on the fifth (?) level stairs
we made it to the top and got to work.  The Archon never showed his face. 
Gruff finished the night up about 2 bubbles and dinged to 32 early on.
<p>

The plan was to poke some giants in the knees again.  We gathered at the WC
druid ring as usual, ported to NK, and started running.  Cole said that he
wanted to stop and check if Glalron the Wicked was spawned as long as we were
in the mountains.  Sure enough, he was there.  Glarlron is a SK (yellow to
Gruff at 31) and went down pretty easily although that first HT knocked Cole
about halfway down in health.  He dropped Woe and Envy which are used for the
shaman epic quest.  Woe also happens to be a *very* nice piercer that Faulkner
was gracious enough to allow Cole to use for now.
<p>
The rest of the evening was pretty routine.  Kill a giant, med, kill a cyclops,
rinse, repeat.  We did get two giants once but I nuked the added one and kited
it away until the first was done.  I think I got roughly 50-60pp for the night
so they weren't quite as generous this time around.  We did try for another
shot at Glalron at the end of the night but he was camped.  Cole and Paldaan
took off shortly afterwords and Kera, Faulkner, Millay and I did some shadowmen
for a while (and had a tough time of it for some reason).
<p>

We started the night assembling at the WC druid ring (Faulkner was AWOL,
Paldaan had joined us) - the plan was to have another go at giant hunting. 
Everybody gets to WC and Millay finally finds a buyer for the Zaharn's Coronet
we picked up in Perma.  Apparently the buyer wants to do the "character X will
pay you, please give it to character Y" thing.  Millay gets paid, the guy logs
to switch to his other character, and is never seen again.
<p>
While waiting a HG popped so we ran after it.  While most of us were standing
around wondering what to do (Millay hadn't joined the group yet), Coleridge
takes the initiative and brings it to us.  By that time Millay had found us so
we formed up and dispatched the giant without much trouble.
<p>
Since the buyer still hadn't shown up and we weren't ready to ditch him just
yet we decided to do some shadowmen for a while.  This went pretty easily and
we had little problem.  Even bunched together as they were we never pulled more
than two thanks to harmony (either mine or Paldaan's).
<p>
We finally gave up on the buyer and set out for the Rathe Mountains.  After
running us round a bit to shake out the muscles (heh) Cole found us a good spot
and we proceeded to start pulling giants.  The initial plan was to do the
snare/fear thing but it turned out the Millay had never bought Fear!  (She did
have AE fear but it didn't seem to work...)  At any rate we didn't really need
it.  We had steady pulls all night with the odd skeleton or Cyclops when the
melee types got restless because Millay and I were lom.  The giants were
yellow/red to Gruff.  Paldaan apparently saw a yellow one once as well (he is
30).
<p>
I think I netted about 70pp for the night with autosplit on.
<p>

Everybody was late so we didn't really get going until 7:30 or 8:00.  We picked
up Paldaan and then decided that we wanted to see how hard it would be to do
the snare/fear thing on giants (knowing full well we might have to bail).  We
ported to EK and ran around for a while without seeing any except for Tarbul
Earthshaker (an epic mob I think).  
<p>
So we gave that up and started headed to Paw.  Paldaan picked up an HG on track
in NK but it turned out to be taken by the time we got there.  We continued on
to Paw and just before we got there we found the Undead Cyclops!  It went down
pretty easily actually although Gruff got beat on pretty bad after the 5th
failed snare.  Cole is keeping the head for Kera.  
<p>
Then into Paw we went and did the camp in front of the double-doors thing.  The
fights were pretty good but there were 2.5 groups or so in the area and not
enough spawns.  We picked up a wizard (Amudan?) and worked the room some more.
Eventually Cole pulled from beyond the doors and got backspawn.  We ended up
with 4 or so, a couple were red and a couple were casters.  Faulk died pretty
much right away (he went down faster than Faulkner with 4 gnolls on him? :) - I
was about halfway through a heal when he went down.  Shortly afterwords I
managed to get an evac off (I had one on me at the time).  We ran back to Paw,
Revive'd Faulkner (grats on being the first in-group revive :) and called it a
night.
