<p><strong>Wednesday, May 9/2001</strong><br>
The following story has been minorly altered.. to be more presentable to the public shall we say.  I would just like to thank everyone very, very much, and apoligize to Maieni, who I believe was the only fatality (and thank you for tp'ing everyone :).  Although they'll likely never see it, I'd also like to help those people from outside the guild that made it possible, Taliefer, Tyberious, Shaxa, and.. aww geez... I need a better memory, should've written these down... there was a 35 troll shaman who helped as well... and I hope the others are all spelt right... <g> but anyway, thank you all... it really meant alot to me :)  (and hopefully after tonight will mean sooo much more :)
<p><strong>Wednesday, May 9/2001</strong><br>
Yesterday Shalave decided he would look a lt cooler with a big, hot, sweaty, flaming sword in his eager little paladin paws. Us, being the idiots that we are decided to help him in this little endever. Here is a short play i wrote to commemorate the event.<br>
<strong>Act 1 Scene 1</strong><br>
<b>Shalave</b>:Hey, Sir Lucan, **edited for younger readers**<br>
<b>Lucan</b>: Raaaage, uuuuahe, graaaww<br>
<b>Shalave</b>: Serrath! take this f%&#er out<br>
Serrath casts flash of light, realizes the implictions of his actions. His brow furrows as he contemplates the afterlif<br>
<b>Serrath</b>: Oh shit...<br>
Serrath, doing the Gods no honor in his pathetic display runs like Rosanne from a weight waters convention screaming and wetting himself like a sissy<br>
<b>Serrath</b>:OhmygodOhmygodOhmygodOhmygodOhmygodOhmygodOhmygodOhmygodOhmygodOhmygod<br>
Serrath reaches the zone. Meawhile Cohenn was lying in wait for the ambush<br>
<b>Cohenn</b>: he he he, now for my revenge! Hail sir Lucan!<br>
...<br>
<b>Cohenn</b>:Hail sir Lucan<br>
...<br>
<b>Cohenn</b>:Hail sir lucan<br>
...<br>
<b>Shalave</b>: ummm.... guys?<br>
<b>Cohenn</b>: Hail sir Lucan<br>
Piixiie charges into battle, guns blazing yelling a war cry loud enough to scare even the most steafast soldier..... just in time to watch Shalave's lvl 58 Warrior friend and 58 Paladin destroy Lucan <br>
<b>Lucan</b>: Oh, it bleeds!<br>
<b>Cohenn</b>: Hail sir Lucan's corpse<br>
Shalave gets his item and everyone lives happilly ever after.<br>
The moral of the story? Call to the zone for high level people because no matter what quest you're doing YOU'RE NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH<br>
THE END<br>
And no, there is no scene 2
<p><strong>Tuesday, May8/2001</strong><br>
Cohenn here, added to the screenshots section FINALLY. We've got some good pics up so check 'em out. Raid on FP is in half an hour so I'd better log on. See you there :)<br>
<p><strong>Friday, May4/2001 10:50</strong><br> Have you ever thought there existed a world outside everquest?  A world of real peoplewo live in houses, get real life jobs, have real life girlfriends, who's primary stats are not counted in numbers and 99% of the people have never even HEARD of the Stein of Moggok. You have to ask someone to find out their name, and most often you'll get a rude responce, guilds do not exist and asking to borrow a few platinum will get you laughed at or attacked. Orcs, elves, Iksar and dragons are the stuff of legends and only one race is senient. Spiders are smaller then your hand and wont climb trees and no-one's ever fallen down the hole. I've been to this place, this... real world, but it was so long ago, almost as if a dream...<br>
We are assassinating the leaderof the freeport militia for the purposes of the soulfire sword for Shalav and Perragon not to mention toasting the captains rotting, bloated, bloody corpse. The date will MOST LIKELY be this Tuesday evening, at about 7 pm EST. He is level 40, so anyone who thinks they can be of assistance wouldbe much appreciated. To clear u all confusion the plan is thus... i, the suicidal cleric, will walk up to him, cast smite and then dvine aura in VER quick succession and run like a little girly man to the zone. This will pull just about EVERY GUARD IN FP, including our target. meawhile, i've zoned, pulling the SOB the zone line where our party will be lying in ambush. After pulling your task will be to keep 'hail'ing him so as to stop his return to freeport. The rest of the guards will return to their post, leaving him behind. The rest will be glorious. Hope to see everyone there... please see the message board for more details and to pledge your support. Fear not death, for we already have  50 cleric who has promised rezzes for all fallen comrades. -Serrath
<p><strong>Thursday, May 3/2001   12:15</strong><br> Serrath here with yet another enthralling update, but first some news. The attack on the ass-monster, Dwigus went off completely as planned with me running around like a chicken shit, too afraid to zone for fear I'd lose the spawn until Sinjune could make him his bitch. I die, Dwigus 1, Serrath 0 but by that time Sinjune was taking him right up and i got to watch as he fell to a God. I hope that will teach him to spawn again. On another note Sir Lucan has enjoyed too many days of pieace in all his corruptness. Verant made the mistake of giving him the essential item for the soulfire quest and charged us with the task of parting its company. Come one, come ass as we rape his sorry ass. Freeport, date and time to be announced, see the message board for more details. Anyone over lvl 40 would be much appreciated, as will healers and sowers. Updates today include a new screenshots page, one can expect a working copy up sometime today. Any questions, comments, complaints or hate mail send to Serrath@mail.com...
<p><strong>Tuesday, April 24/2001   1:00 am</strong><br>
As I quickly run around the site updating a few things (deleted duplicates on the roster, bumped a couple officers up with the rest, fixed a couple typos in yesterdays announcement, and, all dark elves and rogues will be happy to note, you can now be added to the guild roster properly :), I realize that perhaps, at least in these messages, Serrath and I should be distinguishing ourselves (mostly just to avoid confusion when saying "contact *me*" :)  Anyway, sleep has given up calling and is now desperately screaming in my ear......
- Shalave :)
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Monday, April 23/2001</strong><br>
There has been talk but no action...until now. Thursday, April 27th 2001 there will be a raid on the Warrens at 8 pm EST. This is being co-ordinated by myself, and all guild members from level 5 to 60 <g> are invited to attend. Together, united we will OWN the zone and perhaps pick up some nice green equipment for some kind of uniform new look. Everyone who can make it please do i'm hoping this will be a success. Date is is not written in stone; we can make this another time if thurs is bad for people.
