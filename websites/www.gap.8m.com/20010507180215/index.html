<p><strong>Friday, May4/2001 10:50</strong><br> Have you ever thought there existed a world outside everquest?  A world of real peoplewo live in houses, get real life jobs, have real life girlfriends, who's primary stats are not counted in numbers and 99% of the people have never even HEARD of the Stein of Moggok. You have to ask someone to find out their name, and most often you'll get a rude responce, guilds do not exist and asking to borrow a few platinum will get you laughed at or attacked. Orcs, elves, Iksar and dragons are the stuff of legends and only one race is senient. Spiders are smaller then your hand and wont climb trees and no-one's ever fallen down the hole. I've been to this place, this... real world, but it was so long ago, almost as if a dream...<br>
We are assassinating the leaderof the freeport militia for the purposes of the soulfire sword for Shalav and Perragon not to mention toasting the captains rotting, bloated, bloody corpse. The date will MOST LIKELY be this Tuesday evening, at about 7 pm EST. He is level 40, so anyone who thinks they can be of assistance wouldbe much appreciated. To clear u all confusion the plan is thus... i, the suicidal cleric, will walk up to him, cast smite and then dvine aura in VER quick succession and run like a little girly man to the zone. This will pull just about EVERY GUARD IN FP, including our target. meawhile, i've zoned, pulling the SOB the zone line where our party will be lying in ambush. After pulling your task will be to keep 'hail'ing him so as to stop his return to freeport. The rest of the guards will return to their post, leaving him behind. The rest will be glorious. Hope to see everyone there... please see the message board for more details and to pledge your support. Fear not death, for we already have  50 cleric who has promised rezzes for all fallen comrades. -Serrath
<p><strong>Thursday, May 3/2001   12:15</strong><br> Serrath here with yet another enthralling update, but first some news. The attack on the ass-monster, Dwigus went off completely as planned with me running around like a chicken shit, too afraid to zone for fear I'd lose the spawn until Sinjune could make him his bitch. I die, Dwigus 1, Serrath 0 but by that time Sinjune was taking him right up and i got to watch as he fell to a God. I hope that will teach him to spawn again. On another note Sir Lucan has enjoyed too many days of pieace in all his corruptness. Verant made the mistake of giving him the essential item for the soulfire quest and charged us with the task of parting its company. Come one, come ass as we rape his sorry ass. Freeport, date and time to be announced, see the message board for more details. Anyone over lvl 40 would be much appreciated, as will healers and sowers. Updates today include a new screenshots page, one can expect a working copy up sometime today. Any questions, comments, complaints or hate mail send to Serrath@mail.com...

As I quickly run around the site updating a few things (deleted duplicates on the roster, bumped a couple officers up with the rest, fixed a couple typos in yesterdays announcement, and, all dark elves and rogues will be happy to note, you can now be added to the guild roster properly :), I realize that perhaps, at least in these messages, Serrath and I should be distinguishing ourselves (mostly just to avoid confusion when saying "contact *me*" :)  Anyway, sleep has given up calling and is now desperately screaming in my ear......

There has been talk but no action...until now. Thursday, April 27th 2001 there will be a raid on the Warrens at 8 pm EST. This is being co-ordinated by myself, and all guild members from level 5 to 60 <g> are invited to attend. Together, united we will OWN the zone and perhaps pick up some nice green equipment for some kind of uniform new look. Everyone who can make it please do i'm hoping this will be a success. Date is is not written in stone; we can make this another time if thurs is bad for people.

Congratulations Perragon and Maieni!  Absolutely beautiful wedding this morning :)   <g> my only complaint is that it was so early that this morning, by my memory, took place at least a day ago :)   Working on adding a section about the wedding (screenshots and such) which will hopefully be up in a day or so. Also corrected various minor bugs around the page.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Friday, April 20/2001</strong><br>
Yet another emergency patch, so I ended up out here updating a few things.  The guild roster is now up and running, though it will look no different if you check it.  New members can be added through a form available in the officer-only section of the page, which no-one knows how to access quite yet. As such, we'll have to spread that knowledge around. Current members of the guild can e-mail us with their info (or even just post it on the message board) and we'll add it for you, but it will be the responsibility of the officers to add anyone they invite.<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thursday, April 19/2001</strong><br>
Lots of updates going on around the site, though I'd rather the servers were up. Officers only area will be up shortly, though its main purpose is to allow them to update certain things on the site (guild roster mostly).  Also, we hope to see all members at the previously mentioned wedding (details below) this sunday :)<p>&nbsp;</p>
