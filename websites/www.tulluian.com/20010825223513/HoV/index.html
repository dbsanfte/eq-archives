<p>The Harbingers of Virtue were an <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/">Everquest</a> guild on the <a href="http://www.prexus.com/">Prexus</a> server. Though we were never a large guild and did few raids, it was a fun guild while it lasted. It has come to pass that as a result of several factors, the Harbingers have dissolved. Sometime around early 2001, with the retirement of Rycar, one of the guild's founders (the other, Tulluian, had retired the year before) the Harbingers of Virtue ceased to exist. This small web site is a (not very fitting) tribute to the fun that was had and frindships that were made by the Harbingers. Though all of our members have moved on to other things, whether in EQ or RL, there are still occasional updates on the <b><a href="http://pub17.ezboard.com/bharbingersofvirtueezboard">Message Board</a></b>.<br><br>

<h2 align=center>Charter</h2>

<P>The land of Norrath is filled with many things beautiful and wonderful, but also things evil and corrupt. Traitors like Kane Bayle and Lucan D'leer fill our cities with thugs. No traveler is safe from the scourge of bandits and cutthroats, and such evil races as orcs and gnolls seek the downfall of all things good. Far worse are the fiends of demonic nature, unholy beings invading Norrath from the planes of darkness. Many things fair have fallen beneath the onslaught of evil, destroyed or turned to darkness. There are those, however, who do not cower in fear of the evil, nor seek to aid it or avoid it. They are the defenders of all things good, willing to put down their lives in the never-ending struggle against evil. They are the Harbingers of Virtue. No call for help shall go unheeded while a Harbinger is near, and no creature of evil shall be spared from our wrath.

<P>Although equality is a virtue upheld by the Harbingers, in times of crisis leaders are needed. Leadership of the Harbingers, first assumed by the order's founders, Rycar Valorknight and Tulluian Evergreen, may be passed down should one decide to step down, selecting a new leader to rule for him. The Harbingers must always be ruled by two; not one, not three. These leaders must not fail in guiding the order to victory, but they are not despots. Should there be a unaninimous decision of the Harbingers' vote to replace them, new leaders may be elected.

<P>Members of the Harbingers are required to respect all other citizens. As defenders of good, we serve them. If the guild receives two verifiable incidents of a member's misconduct, he shall be removed from the guild. As a Harbinger of Virtue you are expected to value other lives more than your own, but we do not request that you die for others. Above all other rules, each Harbinger of Virtue must remember the virtues: truth, honor, justice, love, and all the others, for those who follow them are blessed, and those who use them to battle evil more so. And of all the virtues, loyalty to the Harbingers of Virtue is most important.

<P>Rycar Valorknight, Paladin of Life<br>
Tulluian Evergreen, Champion of the Faydark<br><br>

Some of these might not be so funny unless you know the person they're about, and even then they may seem stupid, but... enough with this train of thought, and on to the pics!
