  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">One hand weapons are the 
  way to go in my opinion.&nbsp; They are the ones you will normally use, so you can 
  keep your offhand free for a shield, or magic item.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Now, you need to make a 
  decision.&nbsp; One hand blunt is the normal weapon of choice of most Druids.&nbsp; And 
  there is a greater selection of druid-usable one hand blunt items in the 
  game.&nbsp; But in their mighty wisdom, Verant made our Epic weapon a one hand 
  slash scimitar (I won't guess what was going to make that happen! &lt;grin&gt;).&nbsp;
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">So, if you are planning 
  on your epic, I would suggest finding a one hand slash weapon that you can 
  use, and practicing with it.&nbsp; You don't want to try to learn one handed slash 
  when you are in your 50's, trust me!</span></p>

  Mountains, Lavastorm Mountains, The Feerrott, South Ro Desert. At Level 29, 
  you receive the last self only port, to Misty Thicket. The group teleport 
  spells, or &quot;circles&quot;, are first gained at level 29. You receive them in the 
  same order as the self only ports, with the addition of Circle of the 
  Combines, (Dreadlands) and Circle of Iceclad Ocean at 34, and Wind of the 
  North (Skyfire Mountains) and Circle of Great Divide at 39, along with Wind of

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Generally, no. They tend 
  to break a lot more often, and easily than the Wizard/Cleric/Enchanter &quot;Root&quot; 
  spell. The reason for this, is because our root spells also have a damage 
  component to them.&nbsp; So when you cast the spell, there is a check against the 
  root being resisted and also a check against the damage being resisted.&nbsp; If 
  either is resisted, the whole cast is resisted.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-family: Arial">Very recently, the game developers have 
  introduced the ability for players to stack the same DoT on a monster.&nbsp; This 
  had the added (and unforseen) bonus of being able to stack all our DoT's on a 
  monster, in addition to those of another player.&nbsp; So now, ALL DoT's stack with 
  each other, regardless of line.&nbsp; So far, we have not had any reports of there 
  being conflicts with stacking DoT's with other classes.&nbsp; It has yet to be 
  confirmed whether DoT's and items that cast said DoT will stack.</span></p>

  DoT works.&nbsp; When it is finished, cast again.</span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Rotting, or 
  Root-Dotting, involves rooting a monster, stacking DoT's upon it and waiting 
  for the spells to take full effect.&nbsp; This is a very effective method of taking 
  down a single monster with a large amount of hit points (such as giants).&nbsp; It 
  also allows a great level of control while hunting, as the monster is not 
  moving.&nbsp; Done properly, you can gain slightly less, or equal the amount of 
  experience as you would quad-kiting in the same amount of time.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;<b>ShowDynamicLights=TRUE</b>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><b>&nbsp;InvWinLabels=TRUE</b>

    <span style="font-family: Arial">across the screen by your mouse.&nbsp; The 
    higher the number, the faster the mouse scrolling will be.&nbsp; Default is 0.&nbsp;

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;<b>TrackPlayers=TRUE/GROUP/FALSE</b> 
    - This line shows the current selection&nbsp; (Default is TRUE) for showing

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><b>&nbsp;TrackSortType=[Normal/Distance/Consider/Rdistance/Rconsider]</b> 
    - This is a Ranger only ability and is best changed in game.&nbsp; It changes the 
    way that tracking is sorted, and how it shows up.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><b>&nbsp;TrackFilterType=0</b> 
    - This is another Ranger only line that is best changed in-game.&nbsp; The

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><b>&nbsp;ShowSpellEffects=[0-1] 
    - 0=No, 1=Yes.</b>&nbsp; This line allows particle effects to be shown if it 
    equals 1.&nbsp; If this line equals 0, no particle effects will be seen in-game 
    when someone casts a spell.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><b>&nbsp;ServerFilter=[0-1] 
    - 0=No, 1=Yes</b>.&nbsp; If this line is set to 1, than Server side filtering is 
    occurring.&nbsp; Default is 0.&nbsp; If you are having problems with lag in a raid 
    situation, or when many other players are in the same general area in 
    Everquest, it is best to have this set to 1.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></b><span style="font-family: Arial"><b>VideoModeBitsPerPixel=16/32
    </b>- This line reflects and controls the video mode while in Everquest.&nbsp; 
    Default is 16 bits.&nbsp; It is suggested that most players keep this value at 16 
    as increasing to 32 can cause a decrease of performance.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;<b>UseD3DtextureCompression=FALSE</b> 
    - This line turns on/off texture compression.&nbsp; If set to TRUE, it can add 
    much time loading to the game between the server select and character select 
    screens, but can also improve performance.</span></p>
