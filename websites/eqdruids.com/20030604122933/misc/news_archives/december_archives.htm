        Hi Mike. <br>
        <br>
        We didn't make any code changes to the game with the last patch. Right 
        now I'm not aware of any changes that would have caused any problems 
        with multiple accounts on the same IP (though we are aware that a few 
        people are having this problem, and we're looking into it). We don't 
        plan to actively prevent folks from logging on with two accounts on the 
        same IP. This wouldn't be a good thing for those with multiple computers 
        in their homes and others that share a single connection (not that 
        anyone plays at work...). <br>
        <br>
        I don't know what router you are using, or exactly what the problem 
        might be. There have been issues in the past with routers that an 
        upgrade of the firmware has been able to fix, though, and you may want 
        to see if there is an update available. If that doesn't work, you might 
        post your information to our Tech Help forums and see if someone there 
        can help. <br>

        <h1><font size="3" face="Arial">Old UI, We Hardly Knew Ye</font></h1>
        <p><font face="Arial">After much faithful service, it's time for us to 
        bid a fond farewell to EverQuest's Classic and Velious user interfaces.&nbsp; 
        In yesterday's Test Server patch, the old interfaces were disabled.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">While adding many features to the new interface 
        over the past six months, including the built-in MP3 player, item links, 
        compass, and enhanced /bug reporting tool, we've done the best that we 
        could to keep all three interfaces, at the very least, usable.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">However, some of the features that we've been 
        quietly working on over the past weeks have unfortunately forced our 
        hand.&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">We don't want to spoil all of the upcoming changes 
        at once, however, in yesterday's Test Server update, we released the 
        first run of the new EverQuest windowed mode that's been in the works 
        for quite some time now.&nbsp; (In a game that was originally written for a 
        much earlier version of DirectX, it's a lot more work than many would 
        think.)&nbsp; Soon, it will behave in a manner similar to other applications 
        that support both full-screen and windowed mode and can be toggled back 
        and forth.&nbsp; As a part of this change, the account bans related to the 
        use of third-party EverQuest windowing applications have already been 
        reversed.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">In addition, the long-rumored &quot;Bard Box&quot; has also 
        been revealed on the Test Server.&nbsp; For those who are not aware, we've 
        been wanting to add a second Effects window that would hold selected 
        short-duration beneficial effects, most notably many bard songs.&nbsp; 
        Initially, for tuning, the new effects area will allow six additional 
        songs to be placed upon your character.&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">These updates will remain on the <strong>Test 
        Server only</strong> until after the new year, as we expect that much 
        additional testing will be required.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">We hope you'll be as pleased with these latest 
        changes as we are, and we look forward to bringing you many new features 
        in the coming months.</font></p>

        slightly. Please proceed with caution.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Several Planes of Power NPCs are no longer angered quite as 
        badly when they notice a healing spell being cast on a player they are 
        angry with.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Made improvements to the Planes of Power quest armors.</normal>

        <normal>- Assorted quest, item, and dialogue fixes.</normal> <br>
        <normal />
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>** Planes of Power Zone Progression **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>As most know, progressing through Planes of Power zones requires 
        that certain tasks be performed. In many cases, one of the tasks 
        required involves being on a raid that defeats a particularly powerful 
        foe.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>One side effect of this progress is that if the tasks were not 
        accomplished in a particular order, a person on a raid may not gain the 
        flag for completing the event, as they did not complete the prerequisite 
        tasks.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>The majority of &quot;zone boss&quot; style encounters in the first three 
        tiers of Planes of Power zones have been changed to alleviate this 
        problem of completing tasks out of order.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>As of today, if you defeat one of these foes and do not have all 
        of the prerequisites completed to receive the flag at the end of the 
        event, you will be able to go back and complete the tasks that you have 
        not yet performed. </normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>Once you've done that, you may speak with the Seer in the Plane 
        of Knowledge who will make sure that you are then able to progress as if 
        you had performed the tasks in their proper order.</normal> <br>

          <p><font face="Arial">EverQuest&quot; Fan Faire Originator to Help Manage 
          Community For Sigil Games Online and its Future Endeavors </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">SAN DIEGO, CA - December 18, 2002 - Sigil Games 
          Online, Inc., a developer dedicated to massively multiplayer online 
          games, today announced that Cindy Bowens has joined the company as a 
          Community Manager. A pioneer of the &quot;EverQuest&quot; Fan Faire experience, 
          Bowens has specialized in bringing online gamers together, whether 
          in-game or in real life, since 1999. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">Bowens' responsibilities at Sigil will include 
          development of the company web site as well as other community 
          building activities. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Cindy's expertise will be invaluable as we work 
          to create the most open, communicative, and attentive community gaming 
          experience ever,&quot; said Brad McQuaid, president and co-founder of Sigil 
          Games Online. &quot;We will rely on Cindy's ability to bring players 
          together, both online and face-to-face.&quot; </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">&quot;I look forward to continuing community-building 
          activities with my friends at Sigil,&quot; said Bowens. &quot;Bringing fans 
          together has been my passion for many years now, and it's an honor to 
          work with a team so dedicated to building an unprecedented level of 
          online interaction and communication between both the game player and 
          the game developer.&quot; </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">Cindy Bowens joined Verant Interactive in 1999 
          after independently managing gatherings of &quot;EverQuest&quot; players. These 
          gatherings, called &quot;Fan Faires,&quot; became a successful means by which 
          players of the popular game could meet their friends and guildmates in 
          real life. Her interests include building these communities in both 
          traditional and innovative formats, whether through supporting web 
          sites, hosting player gatherings, or employing any one of several new 
          and unique plans she and Sigil have in the works. </font></p>
        </ul>
        <p><font face="Arial">For those that are not aware, Cindy is the one 
        that was the absolute reason that the Fan Faires exist today.&nbsp; Her 
        work and dedication was incredible, and her caring for the fans beyond 
        anything I've seen before.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Congrats to Cindy!&nbsp; And congrats to Sigil for 
        making a very smart move in hiring her!</font></p>

        the latest games and platforms, participate in high-octane tournaments,

        ------------------------------ <br>

        ** Spells ** <br>
        <br>
        - Fixed a number of inconsistencies with Bard song messages. Thanks to 
        the players that submitted the comprehensive list of oddities. <br>
        - Mind Wrack should no longer overwrite Force Shield or the Wizard Epic 
        effect. <br>
        - Splurt should now stack better with most Damage over Time spells. <br>
        - Infectious Cloud should no longer overwrite Demi-Lich. <br>
        - Despair should no longer overwrite Yaulp V. <br>
        - Several spell particle effects should appear correctly on the target 
        now. <br>
        - Several Bard songs have had their animations corrected. <br>
        - Grim Aura should no longer overwrite the Spiritual Brawn series. <br>
        - Riftwind's Protection should no longer overwrite the Augmentation 
        series. <br>
        - Added new particle effects to the Gnomish Firework spells. <br>
        - The Psalm series of bard songs should no longer be overwritten by 
        Elemental Chorus or Purifying Chorus. Additionally, Psalm of Veeshan 
        should overwrite all other lower level Psalms. <br>
        - Searing Flames' fire debuff has been reduced in power, but it should 
        stack with most other debuffs now. <br>
        - The Malo line should no longer overwrite the druid circle series of 
        spells. <br>
        <br>
        ** Items ** <br>
        <br>
        - Shield of the Immaculate now has a 1 second casting time. <br>
        - Anizok's Gauze Press should now summon 20 bandages regardless of your 
        level. <br>
        <br>
        ** Miscellaneous ** <br>
        <br>
        - Aten Ha Ra now draws strength from her allies. It may be unwise to 
        attempt to defeat her without first killing them. <br>
        - Removed most of the negative stat effects from the Shaman made 
        potions. This should make them more useful and allow them to stack 
        better with other magic. <br>
        - Added a few more keys to the player key ring for convenience. <br>
        - Water needed to make a Box of Souls no longer needs to be either 
        Sacred or Holy.</td>

        <p><font face="Arial">Immersing yourself in EverQuest through UI art</font></p>
        </b>
        <p><font face="Arial">During the summer of 2002, the EverQuest team 
        released a new user interface. Players can now customize the interface 
        by creating custom skins, resizing windows, managing multiple chat 
        windows - essentially giving them the power to develop an entirely new 
        look and feel for their window into the world of EverQuest. They can 
        even create their own interface artwork and incorporate it. With more 
        than 400,000 people playing EverQuest, the possibilities for creating 
        unique interfaces are limitless. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Soon after the release of the new UI, community 
        members of the many EQ fan sites starting sharing their interface 
        creations. One of those members started an interface-designing frenzy 
        with his stunning artwork and expertise. His rich and detailed artwork 
        for use in the EQ UI he provided for others to use without cost. His 
        designs were so popular that the bandwidth charges almost caused the 
        artist to remove his UI from the web. In order to preserve his 
        creations, and to ensure the EQ community could continue to enjoy them, 
        Sony Online Entertainment decided to host some of his art on their 
        website.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Tom King did not originally start out as an 
        artist. His background is primarily as a software design engineer in 
        game development and programming. He worked as the Senior 
        Developer/Project Manager for the entire front-end project of the 1998 
        and 1999 versions of Microsoft Golf. He has an intuitive sense of coding 
        and a remarkable ability not only to learn new design tools, but to 
        create his own. This intuitiveness is evident in his passion: Art.
        </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Self-taught in traditional artistic principals and 
        non-traditional artistic tools like 3D Studio Max, Tom honed his 
        artistic craft and dreamed of creating art for computer games. </font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Arial">As a long time EverQuest player, Tom couldn't pass 
        up the opportunity to create his own art for the newly released UI. 
        Spell icons, scrolls, spell books, and other images created by T.King 
        soon hit the Web's EQ community. The EQ experience took on a whole new 
        feel with stunning images that immersed players in the world of Norrath.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">When the makers of EverQuest learned of Tom's EQ 
        UI art and the great demand others had for it, an offer to host his work 
        was made - a rare and welcome offer indeed. Players unfamiliar with 
        &quot;skinning&quot; would need a how-to as well, so they too could try the 
        different styles.</font></p>

        QUALCOMM Incorporated, pioneer and world leader of Code Division 
        Multiple Access (CDMA) digital wireless technology and Sony Online 
        Entertainment Inc. (SOE), a worldwide leader in massively multiplayer 
        online gaming, today announced that a version of EverQuest®, one of the 
        largest and most popular online fantasy adventure games, will make its 
        mobile phone debut on handsets featuring QUALCOMM's Binary Runtime 
        Environment for Wireless™ (BREW™) platform. EverQuest: Hero's Call will 
        offer potential heroes the ability to use their mobile phones to embark 
        on a dangerous journey through 32 dungeons, with access to more than 120 
        spells and a countless array of weaponry that will be familiar to 
        players of the original EverQuest. The adventure is anticipated to begin 
        on select BREW-enabled phones in January 2003. </p>
        <p>“EverQuest: Hero’s Call will deliver an exciting, single-player 
        fantasy adventure set in the mythical world of EverQuest,” said Bart 
        Rothwell, director of wireless gaming for Sony Online Entertainment. 
        “The BREW platform allowed us to create a rich game environment for the 
        mobile phone that will please our diehard community of EverQuest 
        players. We are also excited about the total package BREW provides – 
        giving us a business solution that allows us to bring our popular games 
        to a new segment of the market and to monetize that content.” </p>
        <p>“The development team that created Sony Online Entertainment’s 
        EverQuest: Hero’s Call for wireless handsets has set an important 
        precedent in bringing rich and compelling content to mobile consumers,” 
        said Gina Lombardi, senior vice president of marketing and product 
        management, QUALCOMM Internet Services. “Sony Online Entertainment is 
        taking advantage of the flexibility and wide range of capabilities the 
        BREW platform provides to give consumers access to non-stop action and 
        adventure, anytime, anywhere.” </p>
        <p>Deployments of the BREW solution continue as carriers throughout the 
        world join Verizon Wireless and ALLTEL in the United States, KTF in 
        South Korea and KDDI in Japan in commercializing BREW-based services. 
        U.S. Cellular has launched a BREW user trial and China Unicom announced 
        its plans to launch BREW-based services in China. Twenty-nine 
        BREW-enabled handsets are already available to consumers worldwide, and 
        30 device manufacturers have indicated their interest in the BREW 
        platform. </p>
        <p>QUALCOMM’s BREW platform is a thin application execution environment 
        that provides an open, standard platform for wireless devices. The BREW 
        platform is part of a complete, end-to-end solution for wireless 
        applications development, device configuration, application 
        distribution, and billing and payment. The complete BREW solution 
        includes the BREW SDK™ (software development kit) for developers, the 
        BREW applications platform and porting tools for device manufacturers, 
        and the BREW Distribution System (BDS) that is controlled and managed by 
        carriers – enabling them to easily get applications from developers to 
        market and coordinate the billing and payment process. Carriers’ 
        BREW-based services will enable consumers to customize their handsets by 
        downloading applications over the air from a carrier’s application 
        download server. The BREW platform is a product of QIS, a division 
        within the QUALCOMM Wireless &amp; Internet (QWI) Group of QUALCOMM 
        Incorporated. </p>

        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman">I've tried for about a week to come up with a good way to say 
            this, but since I couldn't I'll just say it. I don't plan on making 
            any more maps for this (or any) site in the future. There is 
            probably a 20-page explanation for why I've decided this, but I'll 
            give you all the brief version. This site has existed now for a 
            little over three-and-a-half years, and has been the work of just 
            myself. While it was very satisfying when I started, it has become 
            less so as time has gone on. I currently barely play EQ anymore for 
            fun, and it's very difficult to be enthusiastic about a fan site for 
            a game that you are no longer a fan for.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman">It would also be accurate to say that the money situation is not 
            really what I had hoped at this point. I had been hoping, at some 
            point, to make a book of the maps I have on this site in order to 
            make enough money to recupe what I had spent in terms of time in the 
            creation and support of the site. After SOE bent me over a barrel, 
            the major publishers felt there wasn't a large enough market for 
            another book, and I don't have the time to create one on my own, so 
            that idea is pretty much dead in the water. Any other potential for 
            making money would probably rely on making up new content for the 
            site that would be pay-for content, and I don't have the time to 
            easily create that kind of material, and it would probably have a 
            limited market and appeal if I did.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the end, though, running any site like this comes down to a 
            major time investment. I can keep up with updates alright, but the 
            creation of new material simply takes too long. I have a regular job 
            that demands 50+ hours a week if I do it right, and I really want to 
            do it right. Therefore, my commitment to this has to change.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman">That all being said, the site isn't going anywhere. It's still 
            going to exist as it does now, and I will keep it as up-to-date as 
            the information you guys send me and the little bit I find out on my 
            own. I may be trying to put up some of the parses I have as just 
            outlines, since that requires very little work on my part at this 
            point and would provide you all with at least some information to 
            use. Who knows, at some point in the future the situation might 
            change and I'll be willing to do more maps, however at this point I 
            wanted to let everyone know that that's not likely to be anytime 
            soon.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial">- Reduced the fizzle rate on Beastlord spells to 
          match that of all other hybrid classes. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">- Fixed a bug that was allowing some charmed 
          NPCs to break mez. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">- Blinding spells will now affect characters on 
          horseback. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">- Spells that automatically target your pet will 
          now work (on your regular pet) when you have a Servant of Ro. </font>
          </p>
          <p><font face="Arial">- You should be able to heal and buff your

          <p><font face="Arial">- Eldritch rune should now absorb more damage
          </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">- The last patch changes to Mental Corruption 
          made it too powerful for a level 52 spell. The damage has been toned 
          down, and the mana recourse has been changed to scale from level 52 to 
          60 </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">** Music Player ** </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">- Typing /mp3 with no arguments will now bring 
          up the Music Player. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">- When saving play lists, the player will 
          automatically remove any extension on the filename entered and replace 
          it with .m3u. Since only files with the .m3u extension can be loaded 
          as playlists by the Music Player, this should remove some &quot;can't load 
          a list I just saved&quot; issues. </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial">If you are working to explore Planes of Power 
          without progressing through the storyline, you may find that the 
          alternate methods to enter some zones now goes a little bit faster.

          <p class="MsoNormal">This is why we are going to have to probably shut 
          off advertising sponsored boards. <br>
          <br>
          Each page view is paid for by us. It costs us real money to host these 
          sites. If you think $3600.00 a year is a lot to host this community, I 
          *BEG* you to go try and do it yourself. Your time and money 
          committment will be far greater than the $300 per month we're 
          charging.<br>
          <br>
          ezboard is probably going to move to GOLD only and ezSupporter only 
          boards... it is the only way we can survive and prosper. There is a 
          viscious cycle happening right now.. people use pop up stoppers which 
          leads to us putting more pop up ads, which leads to more people using 
          pop up stoppers.. <br>
          <br>
          We are at the point where we feel if a person isn't willing to support 
          their community at $1 per month, then that community needs to exist 
          elsewhere b/c frankly, we can't continue to provide service under 
          those conditions.<br>
          <br>
          I applaud Zadkiel for being smart and making a business arrangement to 
          keep this board gold. It is so easy for people to criticize when they 
          know nothing about the time committment and effort it takes to run a 
          community like this.<br>
          <br>
          Stop the hate and support each other - it makes life so much more fun 
          if you focus on the positive rather than the negative.</p>

        <p>We came up with a few tips and comments about using the Music Player. 
        Here are some hints that may help: <br>
        <br>
        - You can use wildcards when specifying files to load. For example, if 
        you click &quot;Add&quot;, browse down to C:\MyMusic, then type &quot;*.mp3&quot; in the 
        edit window portion of the File Selection Window, then click &quot;Ok&quot;, the 
        Music Player Window will attempt to add all files in the C:\MyMusic 
        directory that end in mp3. <br>
        <br>
        - When saving playlists, be sure to put the .M3U extension on the 
        filename or you won't be able to load it again. When loading files, the 
        Music Player looks at the extension to determine what kind of file it 
        is, and won't load files of types it doesn't recognize. <br>
        <br>
        - When first opening the File Selection Window, you may notice a delay 
        while the code determines which drives on your system are valid. <br>
        <br>
        - While songs continue to play during zoning, no song can begin during 
        zoning. The Music Player will continue with the next song when you zone 
        in. <br>
        <br>
        - When the Random button is depressed, the playlist is scrambled. 
        Un-pressing the Random button will revert the list back to its original 
        order for ease in finding certain listings. Pressing Random again will 
        re-scramble the list in a new &quot;random&quot; order.</td>

        <p align="left">In addition, John Needham has been promoted to chief 
        financial officer. With more than 10 years of financial management 
        experience, Mr. Needham will be responsible for overseeing all of the

        <br>
        ** Spells ** <br>
        <br>
        - Affliction Efficiency should now work on Damage over Time spells of 
        level 61 and greater. <br>
        - Imbue Disease should be scribeable by Shaman at level 63. <br>
        - Corrected the range on some Planes of Power group spells so they will 
        affect the group, not just the caster. <br>
        - Corrected the animation for Katta's Song of Sword Dancing. <br>
        - Corrected the animation for Spirit of Eagle. <br>
        - Increased the affect radius of Radiant Cure so that it will affect 
        group members. <br>
        - Changed the method of obtaining the Planes of Power 'imbue' spells. 
        Speak with the fellow that gave them to you before for more information.
        <br>
        - Fixed a bug where casting Levant while on a horse could cause crashes.
        <br>
        - Fixed a problem that was preventing pet owners from controlling their 
        regular pets if they had a Wake the Dead pet in use. <br>
        - Fixed a bug that caused characters to summon corpses with similar 
        names rather than the intended corpse. <br>
        - Fixed a bug with Unswerving Hammer of Faith and Flaming Sword of Xuzl 
        that prevented them from disappearing when they should. <br>

        Dark Terror to correct a faction issue. The Scarecrow form change will 
        be reinstated in the near future. <br>
        - Fixed the spell gem colors for some Area of Effect spells. <br>
        - Corrected more issues with spell turn-ins. You should no longer get 
        vendor sold spells, and all the spells you get should be at the 
        appropriate level. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** Items ** <br>
        <br>
        - Removed the level casting restriction from Necrotic Divining Device.
        <br>
        - Fungus Covered Scale Tunic is now Magic. <br>
        - Removed the &quot;Pending Lore&quot; tag from the Shralok Pack. There is no 
        current plan to make this into a lore item. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** Alternate Advancement ** <br>
        <br>
        - Corrected the description for Host of Elements. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** Tradeskills ** <br>
        <br>
        - Fixed the invisible forge in Felwithe. <br>
        - Added Collapsing Fletching, and Collapsing Mortar and Pestle. Added 
        recipe books for them. <br>
        - Added Vah Shir Spirit Stone recipe. Check existing recipe note for 
        information. <br>
        - Added a few forges to Crystal Caverns in Frostone. <br>
        - Added the Ignore Trivial Loot flag to several temper components for 
        the Firiona Vie server. <br>
        - Removed the Lore tag from the crafted planar steins. <br>
        - Added a level limit and recommended level to some Planes of Power 
        jewel crafted items. <br>
        - Saltwater Seaweed is now tradable. <br>
        - Paladin and Shadowknight gnomes should now be able to gain skill above 
        200 in tinkering. <br>

        Tanaan Smithing Hammer. <br>
        - Stacked items can't be combined in a container, they must be 
        separated. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** User Interface ** <br>
        <br>
        - Fixed an issue in the interface with the size of the last columns in 
        windows. <br>
        - /w all guild will now display all of your guild members. <br>
        - Made it so it is much easier to trade items to a player on a horse.
        <br>
        - Added new column to Bazaar Search Window that will display stat 
        numbers if you choose to sort by a stat. <br>
        - /doability 1 should work again. <br>
        - Increased the size of raids to 72 members. <br>
        - Increased the amount of experience given to the raid for most raid 
        groups. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** Music Player ** <br>
        <br>
        - The Music Player is now available on the Live servers. Alt-K opens the 
        player. Using it should be relatively self-explanatory. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** Miscellaneous ** <br>
        <br>
        - Fixed a couple of broken teleporters in Paineel. <br>
        - The Missionaries should be back on Sullon Zek. <br>
        - Fixed a bug with NPCs' ability to mitigate slow. <br>
        - Fixed an odd bug with enraging NPCs that could cause zones to crash.
        <br>

        when in trader mode. <br>
        - Small races should now be able to get out of the pool in Shadowhaven.
        <br>
        - Your box of Souls should now be returned to you when you are 
        collecting souls. For those of you whose Box of Souls ended up stick in 
        a Soul Orb, combining your Orb inside a Collector's Box from Curator 
        Merri should yield your Box of Souls as well as your Soul Orb. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** Interface Files Changed ** <br>
        <br>

        through the currently playing MP3 <br>

        ** By Winged Messenger ** <br>
        <br>
        A lone messenger streaks across the rocky roads of the mighty Wakening 
        Lands, an urgent message kept safely within his talons. Dire news he 
        brings to his master, the Lord Yelinak; there is much turmoil in wake of 
        the prismatic's release, and he must inform the ancient dragon of the 
        weary times to come. As he rushes past the lumbering trees on all sides 
        of him, he harks back to a more peaceful time. Certainly the brow of his 
        mighty Lord showed less strain, less agitation, though not much. He had 
        always thought that the prismatic's release would surely be more 
        problematic than anything else he could imagine. He now knew that there 
        was much more at stake than ever before, and that the Shrine would need 
        to be on its guard. <br>
        <br>
        As he came to the entrance of the Shrine, he tensed for a moment, hoping 
        that this dire news wouldn't end the life that he and his kin had known 
        for so long. Yet he feared that nothing could stop that change, for the 
        might of the Kin would be tested in the coming times, and there would 
        surely be dangers he had yet to see. He made his way through the 
        corridors up to his master's chambers. As he came closer, he noticed new 
        members of the Kin he had never before seen. As large as his Lord, they 
        spoke quietly amongst themselves and with Yelinak himself. He was 
        unnerved by this startling addition to the Shrine, but felt that it was 
        likely necessary. Perhaps his Lord had already heard the news and had 
        already begun making plans. Either way, it was his duty to inform 
        Yelinak of the recent events; the Giants would know no struggle like 
        that which the Shrine would give them. <br>
        <br>
        He walked towards Lord Yelinak, majestic in his appearance yet with a 
        certain calming aura about him. He cleared his throat and began, &quot;M'lord 
        Yelinak, I bring news from the East...&quot;</font></td>

    <td height=18>From EQLive:<p>Generally speaking we don't announce new 
        NPC functionality, tricks, spell effects or other things that we think 
        are part of the discovery of a new expansion or zone. However, this 
        functionality isn't working properly right now and in doing so it is 
        causing a bit of confusion. <br>
        <br>
        With Planes of Power we gave NPCs the ability to mitigate the effect of 
        slow-type spells. This means that some NPCs have the ability to cause 
        slows to be less than 100% effective. This is not a &quot;slow cap&quot;, when it 
        is working properly. The best slow will have the best effect. <br>
        <br>
        This allows our designers much more freedom to balance encounters when 
        considering the use of slow spells. For Planes of Power they did not 
        have to decide solely between the two extremes of slow taking full 
        effect or just turning it off. The relative power of each slow spell is 
        unchanged, and making NPCs immune to slow spells is not the only option 
        when tuning an encounter. There are some encounters where we would like 
        to see slowing considered a good thing for a group to have, but not to 
        the point where the NPC becomes a wimp after he's slowed. <br>
        <br>
        In theory this is a great thing. <br>
        <br>
        However, some time between beta and the release of Planes of Power this 
        new feature stopped working properly. Thanks to everyone that sent in 
        emails and /bug reports for helping us narrow down the problem. <br>
        <br>
        We are aware of the problem and we're working on getting it fixed. <br>

        I do not have SPECIFIC information saying this affects the Druid Harmony 
        of Nature, but from what I read, it sounds like it is a good bet.</font><font face="verdana" size="2"><p>
        We don't usually get too far into specifics in favor of people 
        discovering the usefulness themselves. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, with an ability as subtle as this one, Charisma's 
        impact is hard to discover, and would likely continue on into the annals 
        of EQ history as &quot;useless.&quot; </p>
        <p>That said -- On the Lull/Harmony series, which has recently been 
        rewritten, there are two checks, as I imagine most everyone knows 
        already. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;Is the effect resisted? </p>
        <p>If the effect <i>is </i>resisted, will the NPC get angry and tell its 
        friends that it's time for a BardSnack(tm), or will it ignore what just 
        happened? </p>
        <p>Charisma is the sole determinant in the second check. It doesn't 
        affect the first. </p>
        <p>As for the in-game justification: If it likes you enough, it might 
        find itself compelled to forgive you for trying to pull a fast one on 
        it. </p>
        <p>Hope that helps. </p>

    <td height=18>From EQLive:<p><font face="verdana" size="2">There is a 
        rare but nasty bug in our billing system right now. We're working on a 
        fix for it now, but it is important that you know about it until we can 
        get it fixed. <br>
        <br>
        There is a rare problem that can cause people to not be credited with 
        all of the expansions that they own. This may cause you to be unable to 
        access a character in an expansion zone. If it believes you are missing 
        Planes of Power you will not be able to gain experience past level 60, 
        or past level 50 if you are missing all expansions. This may cause a 
        loss of experience for some characters in rare instances. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Please double check to make sure that you have the correct expansions 
        listed when you log in.</b> <br>
        <br>
        If you do not, return to the login screen and try logging in again (and 
        again check to make sure you have all appropriate expansions listed). 
        Logging back into the server should restore your access to the 
        expansions, but make certain to check. <br>
        <br>
        For those people who have been affected by this bug -please /petition or 
        use the
        <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/cgi-bin/" eqgm.jsp help services en www.station.sony.com http>
        Contact Your GM link</a> so we can restore your character. <br>
        <br>
        We will have this corrected as quickly as we can. <br>
        <br>
        Thanks for your patience, <br>
