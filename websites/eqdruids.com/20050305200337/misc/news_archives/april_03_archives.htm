        <normal>** Tip of the Day **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>When you first log in you will be presented with a Tip of the 
        Day window. We've added this window to provide helpful insight to new 
        players, and perhaps a few tips for experienced players as well.</normal>
        <br>
        <normal />
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>** Gameplay **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Any character 10th level and under that attempts to attack a 
        'red' /con NPC will receive a warning about the danger of such an 
        action.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Low level characters now memorize and scribe spells much 
        faster.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Guards in Steamfont, Misty Thicket, Butcherblock, Nektulos, 
        East Freeport and West Freeport should be less likely to run through the 
        newbie zone destroying the wildlife</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Improved the respawn rate for monsters in Steamfont, Misty 
        Thicket, Butcherblock, Nektulos, East Freeport and West Freeport. In 
        these zones they were respawning less frequently than in all other 
        newbie zones.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Added food and bag merchants to the newbie yards of Steamfont, 
        East Freeport, West Freeport, Butcherblock and Nektulos.</normal> <br>
        <normal />
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>** Spells **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Fixed a bug that was causing damage shields to assign the 
        credit for their damage to the wrong person.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Fixed a bug that caused a short delay in the hit point updates 
        from healing spells.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Removed Beastlords from the list of classes that can use 
        Strength of Stone. They were never intended to get it, as they have a 
        better spell of the same type at the same level (Furious strength).</normal>
        <br>
        <normal>- Pets will no longer disappear when the pet owner casts a 
        cancel magic type spell on the PC that the pet is attacking.</normal>
        <br>
        <normal>- Fixed a bug that would allow PC's to be attacked by PC 
        controlled pets (in non-PvP situations).</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Talisman of Alacrity now works on the group and not just the 
        caster. It also has the proper icons now.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Modified the text messages on many stun spells to prevent some 
        confusion with their effect on stun immune mobs. The message has been 
        changed from &quot;You have been stunned&quot; to &quot;You are struck by a sudden 
        force.&quot; </normal>
        <br>
        <normal>- Torment of Argli no longer overwrites Torment of Scio.</normal>
        <br>
        <normal>- The Lich series no longer conflicts with other DoT effects. 
        This affects Dark Pact, Allure of Death, Call of Bones, Lich, Demi Lich, 
        Arch Lich, Deathly Temptation, Pact of Hate, Ancient: Master of Death 
        and Seduction of Saryrn.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- The Flame Lick line of spells no longer overwrites hit point 
        buffs such as Valor and Skin like diamond. This affects Flame Lick, 
        Immolation, Breath of Ro and Immolation of Ro.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Changed the name of the druid spell Fury of Ro to Immolation 
        of Ro to avoid confusion with the focus effect Fury of Ro.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Changed the icon for Kragg's Mending to a heart icon to match 
        other Heal spells.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Froglok illusion now changes the character's perspective to 
        the proper height.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Night's Dark Terror has regained its Scarecrow illusion.</normal>
        <br>
        <normal>- Added sounds to several spells that were lacking them.</normal>
        <br>
        <normal>- The cost of the Fuligan Soulstone of Innoruuk has been cut in 
        half.</normal> <br>
        <normal />
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>** Zones **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Acrylia Caverns, Hollowshade Moor and Grimling Forest have 
        been revamped. We have updated the content in these zones to more 
        accurately represent their design intentions and to address concerns 
        voiced by players.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- If you have had an issue with your Plane of Earth B keys, 
        please speak with Muzzrap again and he should be able to straighten 
        things out. Please make sure that you have the raid group that you want 
        to get keyed set up and by your side when you do this.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- The Trial of Fire event will be much less likely to damage 
        people not actually in the trial.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- We've made a pretty extensive pathing update to the Lake of 
        Ill Omen and Beholder, along with several fixes to specific cases in 
        several zones.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Fixed a bug with the Xegony encounter in plane of sky.</normal>
        <br>

        Luclin.</normal> <br>

        <normal />
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>** The Hollow Acrylia Obelisk **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>Do not destroy the Hollow Acrylia Obelisk! Due to the revamp of 
        the Acrylia Caverns, this key will no longer serve its original purpose. 
        We do understand the difficulty of obtaining this key, and we don't want 
        to see that effort lost. We will be looking into a way to allow this key 
        to retain its value, so don't destroy it.</normal> <br>
        <normal />
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>** Items **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>

        component value in red.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Changed the usable race to Froglok on several of the Shin 
        initiates armor quest intermediate pieces.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Giant Field Rat whiskers are about twice as common as they 
        were.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- The Ivory Hilted Cleaver can now be used in the secondary slot 
        (for those that can dual-wield).</normal> <br>
        <normal>- The Ornate Broadsword is no longer listed as usable in the 
        secondary slot, since it is Paladin only and can't actually be used 
        there.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- These items can no longer be worn by Frogloks (they were never 
        intended for use by Frogloks): Fright Forged Helm, Mundane Helm, Mundane 
        Shield, Mundane Mask, Dread Forged Shield and Terror Forged Mask</normal>
        <br>
        <normal>- Murph's Minin' Pick no longer lists Clerics as a class that 
        can use it, since they could not.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Bone Bladed Scimitar no longer lists Beastlords as a class 
        that can use it.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Cracked Bone Shinguards now have a visible graphic when worn.</normal>
        <br>
        <normal>- Sharkbone Plated Shoulderpads effect is now &quot;worn&quot; rather than 
        &quot;combat&quot;.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Stone Etched Mace now displays +135 mana instead of 1135 mana</normal>
        <br>
        <normal>- Extended Affliction III now works on spells with a 30 second 
        duration (lowered from 36 seconds), so it now functions with Sermon of 
        Penitence.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Fireworks have casting sounds and Gnomish fireworks will no 
        longer cause zones to crash.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Compasses once again display the direction you are facing when 
        you right-click and hold.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- The Hammer of Exoneration can now be used by Erudites and Dark 
        Elves.</normal> <br>
        <normal />
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>** NPCs **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Half-Elf bandits are no longer treated as merchants (so they 
        will now leave corpses).</normal> <br>
        <normal>- A Feral Amalgam is now a plant.</normal> <br>

        <normal>- Corrected a bug with AE rampage that caused it to not attack 
        everyone it should.</normal> <br>
        <normal />
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>** Quests **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Fixed the drops for the Comatose spell quest.</normal> <br>

        longer be able spawn in a location where they can't be reached.</normal>
        <br>
        <normal>- Fixed several issues with the 8th cudgel quest.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Increased the drop rate on some quest items in Hate's Fury.</normal>
        <br>
        <normal />
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>** Alternate Advancement Abilities **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Made the Servant of Ro AA pet much more potent.</normal> <br>

        <normal />

        incorrectly.<br>

        the Rallos Zek encounter in the Plane of Tactics, to crash a zone.<br>

        ------------------------------<br>
        <br>
        ** New Plane of Hate **<br>
        <br>
        The new Plane of Hate is now available on Stormhammer. Enjoy!<br>
        <br>
        ** Mitigation Change **<br>
        <br>
        We have evaluated the mitigation abilities of cloth and leather classes, 
        and have made changes as appropriate. For the most part, this change is 
        a reasonable improvement to the ability of monks to absorb damage. At 
        some point in the future we may re-examine the mitigation abilities of 
        chain and plate classes. At this time, and with this final round of 
        changes to cloth and leather classes, we believe that something very 
        close to the appropriate balance is in place.<br>
        <br>
        ** Pathing Update **<br>
        <br>
        The first part of our work to update the pathing system for EverQuest is 
        complete. NPC and pet pathing should be much improved.<br>
        <br>
        ** Charm Changes **<br>
        <br>
        - Healing a charmed pet now generates an appropriate amount of hate for 
        the healer.<br>
        - Charmed pets now take up to one third of the experience for each NPC 
        killed. This amount scales down based on the percentage of damage to the 
        target that the pet does. Dire charm pets still take the same experience 
        they always have.<br>
        - Charmed pets are no longer selected as a monster's preferred target if 
        there are many players available for the monster to attack instead.<br>
        <br>
        ** Windowed Mode for the EverQuest front end **<br>
        <br>
        This patch introduces the ability for players to enter windowed mode at 
        the EverQuest front end (from the time you log in until you get into the 
        game). With this addition, players will be able to run EverQuest in a 
        window from the moment they click on the EverQuest icon to the moment 
        they log out.<br>
        <br>
        In order to switch to windowed mode on the front end, just hit 
        Alt-Enter. Note that there are no settings in the eqclint.ini file for 
        this, you just have to hit Alt-Enter.<br>
        <br>
        Use Alt-R to release the mouse from the EverQuest window (note that once 
        in the game, you need to use Alt-Shift-R to release the mouse).<br>
        <br>
        And, obviously, Alt-Tab will switch between open programs.<br>
        <br>
        We have also added a Tech button that will take you to our Tech Chat. 
        This only works in windowed mode, as it opens up a new window to display 
        the chat.<br>
        <br>
        ** Spells **<br>
        <br>
        - Stoicism now follows the same restrictions as Torpor.<br>
        - Trickster's Augmentation and Boon of the Garou can now be cast by 
        characters on horseback.<br>
        - Fixed a bug that was causing spells with levitation effects to lose 
        levitation if cast over a spell that also had a levitation effect.<br>
        - Bards now receive their first level song at creation.<br>
        - Changed the spelling of &quot;Corpal Empathy&quot; to &quot;Corporeal Empathy&quot;.<br>
        - Changed the hit by message for Torrent of Fatigue recourse to &quot;Your 
        vitality grows.&quot;<br>
        - Changed the wear off message for Song of Sustenance to &quot;Your hunger 
        returns.&quot;<br>
        - Adjusted the shaman spell Disinfecting Aura to be in line with Pure 
        Blood.<br>
        - The Necromancer line of heal-over-time spells should no longer 
        overwrite Transon's Phantasmal Protection.<br>
        - Augment now overwrites Augmentation.<br>
        - Brell's Stalwart Shield now has a casting time of 4 seconds.<br>
        - Spiritual Vigor now has a casting time of 5 seconds.<br>
        - Resurrection no longer gives the &quot;Your strength returns&quot; message two 
        times when the negative effects wear off.<br>
        - Fixed a bug that would cause other players to see a character with 
        default face/hair for their race when they turned off an illusion.<br>
        - Fixed bug that could cause beards to fail to reappear when an illusion 
        wears off. This may also fix some other appearance bugs as well.<br>
        <br>
        ** Illusions/Shape Change **<br>
        <br>
        We have changed the way that Illusions and Shape Changes work with 
        respect to faction. The new system is a lot easier to understand than 
        the old one, so we'll just explain the new one. When changed into the 
        form of a playable race, characters are treated as if they were a member 
        of that race. When changed into a non-playable race, characters retain 
        their own racial factions.<br>
        <br>
        ** PvP **<br>
        <br>
        - If a player is moving when using archery against a PvP target, they 
        have a reduced chance to hit their target.<br>
        - Archery in Player vs. Player combat in now reduced to 66% damage.<br>
        - Direct Damage spells in Player vs. Player combat can only do up to 75% 
        damage of the target's maximum hit points in a single hit. This 
        modification is done before resists are taken into account. For example, 
        if a player has 1000 hit points when fully healed, no single direct 
        damage spell will do more than 750 damage to him in a single hit.<br>
        <br>
        ** Alternate Advancement **<br>
        <br>
        - Alternate Advancement abilities that grant Stamina gains should now 
        update the character's hit points automatically when trained.<br>
        - Dire Charm isno longer &quot;used&quot; when trying to affect an NPC under the 
        power of a Dictate spell. It will not work, and the power is not 
        expended.<br>
        <br>
        ** Interface **<br>
        <br>
        - Using the &quot;/book&quot; command with no page argument now closes the 
        spellbook if it's already open.<br>
        - Added a &quot;Dump&quot; button to Guild Management window. Pressing it creates 
        a text file in the EQ directory containing a comma-delimited text dump 
        of the Guild Management window. The file name will be the guild name 
        with _ instead of spaces, so a guild named &quot;Legacy of Ykesha&quot; would be a 
        file called Legacy_of_Ykesha.txt.<br>
        - Cross-server tells are now filtered under the &quot;tells&quot; filter like 
        same-server tells, and in the same colors.<br>
        - Music Player volume no longer decreases when zoning.<br>
        - The Journal window and Journal Categories window now close when 
        hitting Escape.<br>
        - The Map window no longer pops up after zoning if you used Escape to 
        close it in the previous zone.<br>
        - Hot button names are once again restricted to eight characters. Being 
        able to make them longer was a bug, and was causing issues with 
        displaying more than eight characters.<br>
        - The scrollbar for the Notes window should now update properly when the 
        window is resized.<br>
        - Added multi-select capability to the Friends List, Music, Journal NPC, 
        Journal Text and Journal Category windows. Shift-click selects groups of 
        items, Control-Click selects individual items.<br>
        - Fixed a bug that was causing the Journal window to lose all 
        information since the last save when logging was turned off.<br>
        - Confirmation Dialog window now remembers its position.<br>
        - The third person camera view #3 no longer resets when zoning or using 
        the armor tinting feature.<br>
        - Fixed an uncommon crash caused by the Music Player window.<br>
        - The LFG button in the Group window now toggles the LFG window.<br>
        - Fixed a bug that prevented the attack button from working properly 
        when a Centi Warspear was equipped.<br>
        - The dialog box for confirmation of a change in video modes now remains 
        open for 30 seconds instead of 15 seconds.<br>
        - Added a &quot;Show Offline&quot; button to the Guild Management window. This 
        determines whether or not you want to show offline people in the window, 
        and the setting is remembered when you log out.<br>
        - If you sort by anything other than Name in the Guild Management 
        window, the window will sub-sort your list by name.<br>
        - Changed the promote button in the Guild Management window to only be 
        enabled when eligible guild member is targeted (not just selected in 
        window).<br>
        - Fixed a problem that caused a few people to have the spell particle 
        density revert to default off when they logged off.<br>
        -Fixed the Map window to remove a method of avoiding the map 
        restrictions in certain zones. <br>
        - Added /getguildmotd. This command allows you to see your guild message 
        of the day at any time.<br>
        - /guildmotd now sets or clears the guild message of the day. If used 
        with no text, it clears the existing message of the day. Only leaders 
        and officers can use this command<br>
        - Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when pressing the U key while in 
        explore mode.<br>
        - When under the effects of invisibility, a character that hides and 
        then moves and breaks their hide also breaks their invisibility. The 
        invisibility icon will now disappear under this circumstance so that the 
        player knows he is no longer invisible.<br>
        - Closing the AA window no longer causes the resurrection notification 
        box to disappear.<br>
        - Updated the category lists in the Bazaar window to be alphabetical.<br>
        - Characters will no longer be prevented from being a trader if you 
        quickly click on Begin/End Trader.<br>
        - Fixed a bug with the LFG tool that may have been causing some people 
        to crash when zoning.<br>
        - New colors should no longer be moving from the armor dye column to the 
        item tint column when a character is saved.<br>
        - Hand to hand weapons now &quot;greys out&quot; the melee attack button.<br>
        - For those that type quickly, typing %t1 now has the same effect as 
        typing %t 1.<br>
        - Fixed a bug that prevented you from purchasing a lore item if you have 
        just purchased that item and destroyed it.<br>
        - Setting loot split color now changes the text color when others loot 
        and autosplit, as well as when the player loots.<br>
        - Language skills now update in the skills window immediately, and the 
        message given upon skill up includes the name of the language improved.<br>
        - Default chat channels should now be saved properly.<br>
        <br>
        ** NPCs **<br>
        <br>
        - Corrected an issue with trainers that sometimes caused them to kick a 
        character out of the game.<br>
        - Tin Soldiers no longer give stun immune messages to color flux when 
        they are already stunned.<br>
        - Sollari Bekines now asks for two vials of Gnoll blood instead of one. 
        She has always wanted two for her quest.<br>
        - Corrected some text errors for Avir Sterbla.<br>
        - Fixed a spelling error in Paralin Notion's text. &quot;Other&quot; now reads 
        &quot;Others&quot;.<br>
        - Corrected a spelling error in the Stonefist Clansman's death text. 
        Deafening was spelled incorrectly.<br>
        - Fixed a problem that may have been causing various Brutes to spawn 
        under the world in Warsliks Woods.<br>
        - Corrected an issue that could cause multiple NPCs related to the ring 
        war event to appear in Eastern Wastes.<br>
        - Also corrected an issue with the ring war that was causing some of the 
        NPCs to disappear too early.<br>
        - Undead Sebilisian Lich is now undead. He just didn't realize it 
        before. Feel free to send cards and flowers.<br>
        - So is the Fading Specter in Tox.<br>
        - As is the Failed Apprentice.<br>
        - Lifestealer Mosquitoes no longer give a message that makes them appear 
        to be drinking their own blood.<br>
        - NPCs in Stonebrunt won't be wandering into the ocean and getting lost.<br>
        - Merchants no longer sell containers to any character that have no main 
        inventory slots free.<br>
        - Corrected a spelling error (changed &quot;to&quot; to &quot;too&quot;) in Morgalanth 
        Tal`Raeloen's text.<br>
        - Aid Garuuk now knows that Bregna has moved out of Grobb.<br>
        - Oracle Balek and Grave Lord Vizurik now speak the appropriate text.<br>
        - Coriante Verisue should no longer talk about Miragul all the time.<br>
        - Cobi Frostbeard should no longer refer to himself as &quot;she&quot;.<br>
        - A ghoul in Neriak shouldn't be banging his head on a wall due to a 
        pathing error. If he does it now, it's out of frustration about the way 
        his Dark Elven masters let stinky Trolls into their city.<br>
        - Corrected a spelling error in Elial Brook's text.<br>
        - Frist Furtun now accepts all Upheaval scrolls for his quest.<br>
        - The invisible, untargetable NPCs in the elemental planes that were 
        attacking people have been evicted. Absor is now using them as avatars 
        in PlanetSide, and his scores have gone way up.<br>
        - Corrected a spelling error in the agro text of an Enthralled Underbulk 
        (changed &quot;lungs&quot; to &quot;lunges&quot;).<br>
        - Corrected a grammatical error in the text of Animist Poren (added the 
        word &quot;you&quot; where it as needed).<br>
        - Corrected a spelling error in the text of Elder Animist Dumul 
        (replaced &quot;lose&quot; with &quot;loose&quot;).<br>
        - The new Tailor in Neriak now asks what you [want], not [what] you 
        want.<br>
        - Raewyth Velanor now knows the difference between viscous and vicious.<br>
        - Corrected the text for Wevek Redforge, changed &quot;were&quot; to &quot;we're&quot;.<br>
        - Corrected the punctuation of a Grimling Prisoner. Changed &quot;scuttle's&quot; 
        to &quot;scuttles&quot;.<br>
        - Corrected the spelling of the word &quot;privilege&quot; for Tax Collector 
        Khugra.<br>
        - Corrected the spelling of Incantator Stevak. Changed &quot;and&quot; to &quot;any&quot;.<br>
        - Quartermaster Grik in Gukta now responds appropriately when confronted

        - The Ranger trainer Warder Elwysaie now trains Disarm.<br>
        - Fixed several errors in text on Guard Aerryn.<br>
        <br>
        ** Items **<br>
        <br>
        - Added a Brass Instrument modifier to the Horn of Shadows.<br>
        - Made Saltwater Seaweed stackable.<br>
        - Due to a drop table error, all existing instances of the Market Signet 
        have been changed to have no stats. If you received one legitimately 
        through the quest, you can give the old item to Aid Grimel for a new one 
        with all the correct stats. If you do not meet the requirements, Aid 
        Grimel will not reimburse you.<br>
        - Changed the spelling from Mythril to Mithril on Mithril Knuckles and 
        Mithril Edged Skull Splitter.<br>
        - Removed the ability to be used in the secondary slot from Club of the 
        Secretive. This is a Cleric, Druid, Shaman only item.<br>
        - Removed Bards from being able to equip a Combine Acrylia Halberd and 
        Combine Acrylia Two Handed Sword. These weapons are two-handed slash.<br>
        - The name of the Holy Order of Mithanial has been correctly spelled.<br>
        - Darksight Dagger is no longer listed as being equipable in the 
        secondary hand. It is a caster only item.<br>
        - Barbed Rubicite Coif has had its name change to Barbed Rubicite 
        Pauldrons, since it is a shoulder item, not a head item.<br>
        - Kagazz's Box now combines four scorpion legs to create a Box of 
        Scorpion Legs.<br>
        - Removed Bards and Rogues from the list of classes on Greatstaff of the 
        Four Winds, since they could not use the item.<br>
        - Sample Chest is no longer No Rent.<br>
        - Mushroom Bread now looks like bread in inventory rather than a bowl.<br>
        - Corrected the spelling of venomous on a few items.<br>
        <br>
        ** Miscellaneous **<br>
        <br>
        - Modified checklist flags to make them a little easier to understand 
        (checklist flags are the flags that you obtain for doing PoP events out 
        of order that allow you to complete the final flag quest by gathering 
        all the checklist flags and talking to a Seer). Now when you receive a 
        checklist flag you get a different message than the one that you get 
        when you receive a normal flag. Ask the seer to unlock memories and she 
        will tell you which checklist flags you have. <br>
        - Corrected a problem that was causing PoP raid flag mobs to not give 
        out flags to anyone if the associated boss was killed by someone not in 
        the raid group. Now if someone not in a raid gets the kill, only people 
        not in a raid can get flagged. This means that people may have to leave 
        a raid to get flagged, but it means that raids should no longer miss 
        flags if someone outside the raid gets the kill.<br>
        - Modified several of the Planes of Power alternate entry quests to make 
        completing them faster. Also, all of these quests will now give a &quot;key&quot; 
        to everyone in the group of the person that completes it.<br>
        - Corrected a spelling error in the text message given when you can no 
        longer add unflagged people to your raid (&quot;to&quot; is now &quot;too&quot;).<br>
        - Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause helmets to seem to disappear 
        off a character that was dealing with a merchant or casting an illusion.<br>
        - /Consent no longer gives both a success and fail message to player 
        consented.<br>
        - Frogloks wearing robes no longer lose the color on the bottom portion 
        of their robes when they zone.<br>
        - Fixed some issues with alchemy not combining into dose potions.<br>
        - Fixed a bug that could cause invalid and unchangeable numbers to 
        appear in spell-casting specialization skills if the skill was trained 
        up after level 50.<br>
        - Merchants no longer claim that they will pay 1 copper for newbie items 
        that they can't actually buy.<br>
        - The player's first person perspective now changes correctly if the 
        height of their Froglok is changed. <br>
        - Removed an unneeded door in High Keep.<br>
        <br>
