                <font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 9pt">Runes for Omens 
                Spells<br>
                <br>
                There are five types of runes you can obtain through Omens Of 
                War to trade in for 66-70 spells.<br>
                <br>
                Here is what they are:<br>
                1) Minor Muramite Rune: Level 66 spell.<br>
                2) Lesser Muramite Rune: Level 67 spell.<br>
                3) Muramite Rune: Level 68 spell.<br>
                4) Greater Muramite Rune: Level 69 spell.<br>
                5) Glowing Muramite Rune: Level 70 spell.<br>
                <br>
                They are all turned into the same guy, he is SW of the zone in 
                to Dranik's Scar. His location is -1650,-40. (Basically, go 
                southwest and look for the red con mob).<br>
                <br>
                They all drop from various named, the higher level the named, 
                the greater the rune will be. Obviously, the level 69/70 spells 
                will drop off of raid-encounter type mobs.<br>
                <br>
                You will never receive a duplicate spell. You only will get a 
                spell you need from turn in.<br>
                <br>
                The port spells for Druid and Wizard are very easy to get. The 
                components will drop from random trash mobs in the Bloodfields 
                (crystals and parchments), and in Wall of Slaughter (blood and 
                parchments). You need 3 crystals/blood per 1 parchment for a 
                single spell.<br>
                <br>
                Enjoy!</font></p>

                Omens Of War Task system provides NPCs which will give you 
                personal or small-group tasks to complete. You'll have to find 
                the correct Task Master to request tasks from, and this listing

                -------------------<br>
                The Priests of Discord in Norrath believe they have been granted 
                a gift. A unique knowledge has been bestowed upon them which 
                they believe was granted as a reward for preaching the way of 
                Discord. That gift, they claim, is the knowledge of a way to a 
                world that is enveloped by Discord itself -- an ethereal poison 
                that wreaks havoc and strife upon all it touches.<br>
                <br>
                Speak to a Priest of Discord to learn how to enter the World of 
                Kuua.<br>
                <br>
                The Task System<br>
                -------------------<br>
                Only have a short time to play or are you waiting for a group or 
                raid? Immerse yourself in a Task. You can find Task Masters all 
                over Norrath. They can be found in most home cities as well as 
                in places like the East Commonlands, the Butcherblock Mountains, 
                Toxxulia Forest and the Swamp of No Hope. For the more daring 
                individuals, the most challenging tasks can be found by speaking 
                with Task Masters in the Dreadlands and the Overthere.<br>
                <br>
                You can open the task window by hitting Alt+Q and start enjoying 
                this new game-play style and enhancement to the EverQuest 
                experience.<br>
                <br>
                Be mindful of turning in task items in stacks, as with all 
                quests in EQ, please seperate the items before turning them in 
                for a reward.<br>
                <br>
                Epic Weapons 2.0<br>
                -------------------<br>
                Will you be the first of your class to earn these powerful new 
                items?<br>
                <br>
                Guild Tribute<br>
                -------------------<br>
                Omens of War expansion brings a new Guild Tribute system. This 
                system will allow guild members to donate items/cash for Tribute 
                points, and allow officers to select benefits that the entire 
                guild will receive, deducting the cost from the guild’’s tribute 
                pool.<br>
                <br>
                Guild Tribute is an extension of the tribute system introduced 
                in Gates of Discord and purchasers of either expansion, will be 
                able to reap the new benefits.<br>
                <br>
                Retail Claim Item<br>
                -------------------<br>
                Those of you who purchased the retail version of EverQuest: 
                Omens of War will need to use the /claim command in-game to 
                receive your in-game items. Enjoy!<br>
                <br>
                Select your title<br>
                -------------------<br>
                You can hit Shift+T to bring up the new Title selection UI which 
                will allow you to choose from the titles you have earned, 
                through AAs, levels or accomplishments, to be shown with your 
                character name in-game.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Voice Macros<br>
                -------------------<br>
                Using Ctrl+V will bring up the new Voice Macro UI. There you 
                will see a list of available voice macros as well as the options 
                of Play, Tell, Group and Raid. Selecting a macro and play will 
                play the macro for you only. Selecting a macro and using one of 
                the other options will send the voice macro to either a tell 
                (using the person you have targeted as the recipient), group or 
                raid.<br>
                <br>
                To create your own voice macros, make a sound file using the 
                same name as one of the existing voice macros, which can be 
                found in your EverQuest&gt;Voice&gt;Default directory and place it in 
                your EverQuest&gt;Voice&gt;User directory.<br>
                <br>
                You can create hot keys of your favorite Voice Macros by 
                selecting the macro you would like and clicking and holding on 
                the Tell, Raid or Group button until the icon appears on your 
                cursor.<br>
                <br>
                We hope you enjoy this new way to immerse yourself into the 
                EverQuest experience.<br>

                For the first time in EQ, you can open up a new spell slot by 
                learning the Mnemonic Retention AA ability. 9 Spell slots! Wow, 
                Why I remember in the early days of EQ, we only had 8 spell 
                slots and we liked it. We cast spells all day, going uphill both 
                ways. You whippersnappers have it easy =)<br>
                <br>
                More Buff Slots<br>
                -------------------<br>
                If you find that you need more room for beneficial buffs on your 
                character, activate the Mystical Attuning AA and open up more 
                room in your buff slot window.<br>
                <br>
                Improved Customization for Graphics<br>
                -------------------<br>
                -There are now 3 sets of options (Spell, Environment, and 
                Actor). All 3 sets have similar options that affect each type of 
                particle. These options allow for more customization when 
                setting up your display and filters.<br>
                <br>
                -An &quot;advanced&quot; button has been added under the display tab in 
                the options window. This will allow you to toggle some of the 
                new settings, for our new customizable graphics and effects. You 
                will most likely need to expand the options window to see the 
                new Advanced button.<br>
                <br>
                - Shadows; Toggles the new dynamic shadows.<br>
                - Water Swap*: Switches between old style water, and new 
                reflective water the next time you zone.<br>
                - 2.X Pixel Shaders: Toggles the use of pixel shaders 2.0.<br>
                - 1.X Pixel Shaders: Toggles the use of pixel shaders 1.0.<br>
                - Vertex Shaders: Toggles the use of vertex shaders.<br>
                - Sky Reflection Type*: Set to Static to use a preset reflection 
                or Dynamic to have the sky reflected on the water.<br>
                - Dynamic Update Interval: Control the CPU costs of the dynamic 
                reflection by adjusting how often to update the reflection 
                texture<br>
                - Dynamic Sky Reflection Size*: Allows you to control how large 
                the reflection texture is.<br>
                (The * indicates a setting that will take effect next time you 
                zone).<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                - You can now see real time shadows within the world of Norrath. 
                Use the shadows option in options&gt;Display&gt;advanced to turn them 
                off and on. Now, even when soloing, you will never be alone. 
                Those of you with older video cards may have some performance 
                issues when attempting to use shadows. If your machine does not 
                meet the recommended system specifications, we suggest that you 
                play with shadows off.<br>
                <br>
                - Enjoy sunsets and moonrises viewed above EverQuest's new 
                reflective water which is available for everyone, wherever there 
                is static water, e.g. Oceans, seas and lakes. You can toggle the 
                new water shaders on and off using the Water Swap button, under 
                options&gt;display&gt;advanced.<br>
                <br>
                Zoning Screen<br>
                -------------------<br>

                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 9pt">
                <b>Shadow Knight PvP Guide</b><br>
                <br>
                Remember all direct damage spells on PvP servers do 2/3rds of 
                their normal damage.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Level 1-29:</b><br>
                <br>
                From level 1-9 you'll basically be a Warrior without kick and 
                with less hitpoints. Just hurry and make level 9 and get your 
                spells. The damage cap on weapons is very annoying during these 
                levels. From level 1-10 you'll be able to hit for 20 damage max. 
                Level 10-20 you'll be able to hit for 29 damage. Level 20-30 
                you'll be able to hit for approx. 60-70 damage. Always use your 
                ATK/AC drains during these levels. At level 15 you'll get your 
                first snare, this spell will always be usefull because it is 
                harder to resist. The lifetap you get is esentially worthless in 
                PvP. You'll always be better off just attacking with your 
                weapon.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Level 30-48:</b><br>
                <br>
                Finally the weapon damage cap will be gone and you should be 
                able to do some fearsome damage depending on your equipment of 
                course. You get a decent lifetap at level 30, it still leaves 
                something lacking but at least it's a heal. You get your first 
                Spear spell in these levels as well. Always keep your spears 
                memmed and chain cast them on your opponent. The spears combined 
                with the hard to resist Heat Blood line makes for some decent 
                spell damage. Your melee damage will put you over the top 
                though. Always drain STR/AC/ATK from people.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Level 49-55:</b><br>
                <br>
                These levels will further increase your DoT lines as well as 
                adding more Spears. Level 50 is the official end of the weapons 
                cap. You should do the Life Leach quest as it's a very nice 
                lifetap for these levels. If you choose not to do the quest 
                you'll be stuck with the 75dmg lifetap that will do 50dmg in PvP. 
                Gear at these levels all the way to 65 will be very important. 
                While SKs get some nice spells the damage you can do with a 
                weapon will always outdo it. You should get Run 3 as soon as you 
                can, this will help out alot in dungeons which is where you will 
                excel at PvP.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Level 56-59:</b><br>
                <br>
                Finally you'll get a real lifetap spell that does 226dmg and 
                doesn't require a quest to get. Unfortunatly once you make level 
                57(TZ/VZ) or 61 (RZ) you'll be in range to level 65s. This is a 
                very hard time to level as a melee on a PvP server. If you're 
                ever rooted/snare chain cast your lifetaps on your opponent. 
                Your best chance is to stay alive long enough to get some melee 
                in and make them waste their mana on your HPs/Resists/Lifetaps.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Level 60-65:</b><br>
                <br>
                You get a very nice selection of DoTs in these levels. Always 
                stack as many DoTs on your opponent as you can. Just run up and 
                hit them and while your sword is delaying cast your DoT. You get 
                a 400dmg lifetap as well, if you can grind some AAs and get 
                Spell Casting Fury 3 this lifetap can put some BIG dents in 
                people. Use the pet you get as it's the level 49 Necro pet and 
                does a decent amount of damage as well as interrupting casters. 
                In order of casting, you should engage opponents with Dispell/Normal 
                DoTs/ATK Drain/AC Drain/Lifetap DoT/Spears/Lifetap in that 
                order.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Top Easy-To-Get PvP Items:</b><br>
                <br>
                I tried to pick the top three items that are usefull most of 
                your levels. There are of course better things once you get

                Developer's Update: Why was OoW delayed?</font></b></p>
                </font>
                <font style="font-size: 9pt">
                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana">pretty simple question in 
                itself...<br>
                <br>
                Was it to address player issues, hence why you had the summit?<br>
                <br>
                Was it because you last expansion (GoD) was still not finished 
                and encounters in there were bugged?<br>
                <br>
                Was it because level 70 was still not ready, and since you had 
                already released content based on level 70, you needed to finish 
                out thoughts on level 70 spells and stats?(remember Brenlo 
                stated that level 70 was supposed to be introduced on the fifth 
                aniversary as a FREE upgrade to all and GoD was tuned based on 
                that expectation of level 70)<br>
                <br>
                Was it because OoW was simply not ready to be released on time, 
                and needed to be delayed anyways?<br>
                <br>
                Was it simple lip service to calm people down in hopes that they 
                would pay for thier account a few more months while you sorted 
                things out?<br>
                <br>
                I'm way way disapointed in seeing so many of the monk top ten 
                being put on hold until after oow, especially after it was 
                stated that these were separate teams of developers and OoW had 
                it's own subgroup of staff.<br>

                To stop any nashing of teeth before it starts, the berserker 
                AA's are planned to be included in the update scheduled for the 
                same day as the Omens launch, but they are not part of the Omens 
                launch. Therefore if you choose not to purchase the expansion on 
                the day it launches you will still get the berserker AA's that 
                are included in the update.<br>

                There appears to be /pet nocast commands on test, based off 
                parsing of the strings there. How about a /pet no melee and /pet 
                do not move ability? /pet no melee makes the pet not attack 
                anything in melee combat. No matter what, they refuse to melee.<br>
                <br>
                /pet do not move makes the pet not move. They won't charge 
                opponents, but rather stand still. They can still have aggro. 
                Together with a non-damaging root on an earth pet, you could use 
                an earth pet to effectively CC any rootable NPC.<br>
                <br>
                /pet no melee<br>
                /pet do not move<br>
                /pet cast<br>
                /pet attack <br>
                <br>
                will make an earth pet stay still and chain cast root (up to 
                recast delay) on its target. This also gives mages 'ghetto 
                snare' for soloing. It also has utility with air and fire pets.<br>

                I've always thought the pets should have more utility. Don't get 
                me wrong some of them are fairly powerful. However, the 
                inability to effectively control them makes their usage limited 
                in group and raid situations. For more information, click

                Fix Random Video Lag</font><font size="6" color="red"><b><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 9pt" color="#993333">:</font></b></font></p>
                <p align="left">
                <font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 9pt">A lot of people have 
                noticed what appears to be random video lag since the DirectX 9 
                engine went live several months ago. Many players, even with 
                very high end systems, are forced to log out and back in or even 
                restart in some cases due to video lag that makes the game 
                unplayable for them. Many others have been unable to &quot;Dual Box&quot; 
                since that patch for the same reasons.<br>
                <br>
                The problem that's causing this is a simple memory leak that 
                Sony either can't find or doesn't care about. This is why most 
                people notice the problem after they've zoned a few times. The 
                better your<br>
                system, the longer you can go without noticing it, but 
                eventually it hits everyone at some point.<br>
                <br>
                Thankfully, there's a very simple workaround for this. Simply 
                hold down ALT and hit ENTER at the same time. This is the toggle 
                between windowed and full screen modes. It forces the game to 
                re-allocate resources and re-draw the world and UI due to the 
                screen changing sizes. You can do it twice to maintain whichever 
                way you normally play, but this method will get rid of that 
                &quot;random&quot; video lag that's been happening with the new engine.<br>
                <br>
                Many people in my guild have used this simple workaround to 
                great effect, and are able to play in<br>
                zones where they could not before, and are enjoying EverQuest 
                again. If the lag is bugging you, give this a try. Heck, I don't 
                even lag in PoK anymore after using this. </font></p>

                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 9pt">A 
                recent patch added new commands to allow others to drag your 
                corpse, but they didn't make it into the patch release notes.<br>
                /consent group - flags your current corpse(s) so they can be 
                dragged by all current group members.<br>
                /consent raid - flags your current corpse(s) so they can be 
                dragged by any members of your current raid (including people 
                who join the raid later).<br>
                /consent guild - flags your current corpse(s) so they can be 
                dragged by anyone in your guild.<br>
                /deny group - removes the flag<br>
                /deny raid - removes the flag<br>
                /deny guild - removes the flag<br>
                --- <br>
                When you need to drag someone's corpse, rather than use a hotkey 
                that has &quot;/corpse&quot; in it, there is a &quot;/corpsedrag&quot; command that 
                you can use to make things easier for you.. If you target the 
                corpse you&nbsp;need to drag and type &quot;/corpsedrag&quot;, it acts as an 
                autofollow for the corpse! The corpse will follow you wherever 
                you need to go!<br>
                <br>
                When you get to where you wanna drag it to, just use the &quot;/corpsedrop&quot; 
                command to release it :)<br>
                <br>
                Now, I'm not sure if you could attach multiple corpses to you or 
                not, as I've only had to drag 1 corpse since I found this 
                command. But it could be handy if you could drag more than one 
                corpse&nbsp;at a time.</font></p>

              Before I post your updated list I would like to give you a little 
              bit of information on the notes I have made on each item. <br>
              <br>
              Currently being evaluated – This means that a few of the 
              development team members are looking into ways to implement the 
              item. This does not guarantee that the item will be implemented; 
              however we may see changes made in the future. The Community Team 
              plans to give updates on these types of items every 2 weeks, even 
              if it’s just a “no change since the last update” <br>
              <br>
              Currently being discussed – This is almost just like being 
              evaluated however these items the development team is totally 
              undecided if they want to implement or how to do so. The Community 
              Team plans to give updates on these types of items every 2 weeks, 
              even if it’s just a “no change since the last update” <br>
              <br>
              Done – This means that the development team has implemented this 
              item and it’s currently on live servers. <br>
              <br>
              Currently on Test server – This means that the development team 
              has implement this item and it’s currently on test server, watch 
              for future updates for implementation on the live servers. <br>
              <br>
              Waiting for community feedback – This means we don’t have enough 
              information to make any type of decision on how to implement. 
              Threads will be started by me to get your feedback. <br>
              <br>
              No changes planned at this time – This means that the development 
              team has decided at this time not to implement this item. <br>
              <br>
              Items that are marked done will be removed from the top 10 issues 
              lists and you as a class will be able to replace those with new 
              issues. Watch for posts on this in the next week, your class 
              correspondents will be helping SOE update your top 10 issues lists 
              with these new items. If your top issues list was less then 10 
              issues to begin with you will be able to add more issues. <br>
              <br>
              You as a class will have the option to replace items that are 
              marked as “no changes planned at this time” with new items or 
              leave them on the list. Please understand that leaving them on the 
              list does not mean that they will eventually be implemented 
              however it does mean that the class as a whole still feels that 
              these are valid issues and would like implementation eventually. 
              One thing to note, we will not be responding to requests as to why 
              something is classified the way it is. <br>

                again, like when I first stepped into Norrath. But I guess we'll 
                just have to wait and see what really does happen. On that front

                Gates of Discord <br>
                ------------------- <br>
                - Zone experience modifiers were increased in all zones from Tipt/Vxed 
                and beyond. <br>
                - Natimbi, Qinimi, Barindu, Riwwi, and Ferubi should be tuned 
                more appropriately for their intended level ranges. <br>
                - NPCs will no longer hit for max damage as often. Knights in 
                particular should find it easier to tank the NPCs they previously 
                had difficulty with. <br>
                - Ikkinz -- Guilds no longer have to flag every member in order 
                to complete the Ikkinz trials. Only one person needs to complete 
                all events/raids to start the seventh Ikkinz trial. At that point, 
                all players who complete the seventh trial will get full credit 
                for the zone. <br>
                - NPC innates have been adjusted to behave a little more reasonably. 
                <br>
                - Zone travel has been made easier. Animal aggression was lowered 
                by changing their faction and See Invis percentages were reduced 
                on several NPCs. <br>
                - Spell drops have been increased. <br>
                - Increased the rate of cash drops. <br>
                - The mini bosses in Qvic now have a more appropriate respawn 
                rate. Their item drop rate has been increased to compensate for 
                this. <br>

                seems that some folks are concerned about an email that they are 
                receiving from IGN offering them a free Classic EverQuest account. 
                There is some concern that this is a scam. <br>
                It isn't.<br>
                IGN has indeed been authorized to give away these accounts. If 
                they give you one, take it! </span></em></p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory"><em>Keep in mind that in order 
                for someone to 'scam' you they'll need to acquire information 
                from you that they can use. If someone asks you for a password 
                on your existing EverQuest account, don't give it to them. IGN 
                isn't asking for such information, they're just giving out accounts.</em></p>

                the new ones may be. </p>

                East Wastes. You will be able to swap the items back and forth
