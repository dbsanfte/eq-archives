    <td height=18><font face="Arial">Rich Waters has responded to the 
        worries from Druids and Rangers over the changes in Harmony.&nbsp; He 
        has this to say:</font><p><b>I've been following the threads here and on 
        the Ranger's Glade about Harmony today and wanted to give some more 
        information on the reasoning behind the change.<br>
        <br>
        Harmony is the druid and ranger version of the lull line of spells. 
        Several classes get these types of spells, with enchanters, bards, and 
        clerics being the best at it overall. Lulls work by lowering the range 
        at which monsters will attack you, allowing you to pull a single monster 
        out of a group by lulling it's companions.<br>
        <br>
        Traditionally, most lull spells haven't really worked very well. Lull 
        had a high resist rate and wasn't very reliable. We've recently looked 
        at lulls and improved the way they work to make them more useful to 
        players. You should find that the lull line of spells works more often 
        than it did, though it will still fail some of the time.<br>
        <br>
        Harmony was unique in that when you cast it on an NPC, it never failed. 
        This essentially means that Harmony could be used for risk-free pulling 
        every time. All other lull spells have a resist check, allowing a 
        monster to not be affected by them. The fact that Harmony can't be 
        resisted made it the very best of the lull spells - which is an odd 
        thing to happen to a level 5 spell.<br>
        <br>
        We've had the ability for awhile now to make it so certain monsters were 
        totally immune to being lulled. This is especially common in higher 
        level outdoor zones such as Cazic-Thule, since Harmony would take any 
        challenge out of splitting groups of monsters. Having a such powerful 
        game dynamic with no risk of failure made these encounters too easy, so 
        we were forced to make many monsters totally lull immune to compensate. 
        With this change to Harmony, we'll now be able to remove the lull 
        immunity from many monsters, and turn this ability into a useful spell 
        line that gives great benefits, but with some risk that your spell may 
        be resisted.<br>
        <br>
        This week, we'll be adding an upgrade to Harmony that works on higher 
        level monsters. We'll also be removing the lull immunity from many 
        higher level monsters in outdoor zones, to accommodate the new spell. 
        The higher level version of Harmony will have some chance of being 
        resisted, but will be a fairly reliable way to split up groups of 
        outdoor monsters. We do want this spell line to be a useful tool for you 
        at all levels, but as with all other forms of crowd control there needs 
        to be some chance that it won't always work. Druids and rangers should 
        get a excellent outdoor lull, but a level 5 spell probably shouldn't be 
        the best it ever gets.<br>

        <normal>*** Planes of Power is now Live ***</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>Welcome to the Planes of Power. Of course, if you haven't 
        purchased the expansion you can do so at our online store at 
        www.everquest.com. If you have, prepare for adventure beyond Norrath and 
        into the realm of the gods. We hope you have fun.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>One of the new features included in the Planes of Power is a new 
        way for NPCs deal with Player Characters. It allows NPCs to recognize 
        certain actions taken by player characters. This may mean that an NPC 
        will not be interested in talking to you until you've accomplished a 
        certain task or until certain events have occurred. So some NPCs may not 
        have much to say to you upon your first meeting, but might be more 
        talkative later. This can also apply to events and locations that might 
        react differently to a character that has accomplished a task than to 
        one that has not.</normal> <br>

        <normal>** Important Notice about unspent Alternate Advancement points 
        **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>With this patch any character with more than 30 unspent AA 
        points will have those points deleted when they log in.</normal> <br>

        <br>
        <normal />
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>** Raids **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>The Raid functionality has been added. Here is a brief overview 
        of the Raid system.</normal> <br>
        <normal />
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>In the past, experience on raids would generally go to a single 
        group or a few groups. The group doing the most damage would get the 
        experience on any given kill. But, that has been changed by a new Raid 
        feature.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>The Raid system is intended to aid in the formation and 
        organizing raids and make looting on raids a little more manageable. It 
        allows a certain amount of experience to be shared among all members of 
        a raid. The basics of the system work very much like grouping has always 
        worked. The Raid Leader is the leader of all the raid groups and the 
        group leaders remain leaders of their individual groups.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>Alt-R or /raidwindow will toggle the new Raid Window. This 
        window works much like the group window. You can invite people to the 
        raid (if you are the raid leader) and see a list of the folks in your 
        raid, along with the status of those members (Raid Leader, Group Leader 
        or raid member - which shows with no rank). It also shows you the group 
        number of the individual members. </normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>Only Raid Leaders and Raid Group Leaders can invite people to a 
        raid. This is done with the Invite button on the raid window.</normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>If a Raid Leader invites an individual (someone not in a group), 
        that person joins the raid as a Raid Group Leader. If the Raid Leader 
        invites a member of a group, the entire group joins the raid, and their 
        group leader becomes a Raid Group Leader. </normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>A Raid Group Leader can invite people to their group, thus 
        inviting them to join the raid group as well. </normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>Only a Raid Leader can remove someone from the raid. He or she 
        does so simply by clicking on the character's name in the raid window 
        and clicking the Disband button (also in the raid window). </normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>Being removed from your group (using the normal grouping 
        features) will not remove you from the raid. </normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>You can remove yourself from the raid just by clicking the 
        Disband button in the raid window. </normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>Just like groups, raids have their own chat channel. /rsay works 
        for the raid just as /gsay does for groups. Just like group chat, you 
        can set this to be your default channel for a given chat window by 
        choosing it from the right-click Default Channel context menu. </normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>Experience for killing NPCs will be distributed to all members 
        of the raid that are within range. However, the experience given will be 
        smaller than the experience that would be earned by a single group. 
        Generally, unless you are fighting NPCs that require a raid, you will 
        still be better off earning experience with the old fashioned six-person 
        group. </normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>Raids will definitely allow for larger than traditional groups, 
        however, much of EverQuest is designed with the six-person group in 
        mind. Adding a small number of people to a given group will allow this 
        &quot;oversized&quot; group to gain experience. However, we recommend that once a 
        &quot;raid&quot; of ten or more people forms, a second, traditional group split 
        off and adventure on their own. </normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>The Raid Leader determines the looting permissions for any NPC 
        killed by the raid. There are three types of looting that the leader can 
        choose from (though the Raid Leader can always loot NPCs killed by the 
        raid). </normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>1. Only the raid leader can loot until the corpse opens up for 
        all </normal>
        <br>
        <normal>2. Only the raid leader and raid group leaders can loot until 
        the corpse opens up </normal>
        <br>
        <normal>3. Raid leader chooses up to 9 other raid members that can loot 
        until the corpse opens up </normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>Please note that altering loot permissions only applies to NPCs 
        that are killed after changing this setting. See the command list below 
        for more information about setting raid loot permissions.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>When an item is looted by a raid member, a loot message is sent 
        to all members of the raid. </normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>Summary of Raid Commands: </normal>

        change didn't have the intended effect (you can see the original plans

        <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/cgi-bin/" articles.jsp?id="52118" community eqlive.station.sony.com http>
        Development Update</a>). We've changed the plan a bit. The new changes 
        (listed below) will be Live tomorrow. Obviously we want to address the 
        issues mentioned in the Update (&quot;...perhaps single-handedly altered the 
        balance of the end-game encounter...&quot;), and this change still does that. 
        But at the same time we wanted to allow mages to contribute using Mod 
        Rods without reducing their ability to contribute damage. <br>
        <br>
        So, without further rambling from me, here are the changes that will be 
        going in tomorrow: <br>
        <br>
        The Rod of Mystical Transvergence spell will be renamed &quot;Mass Mystical 
        Transvergence&quot;. When cast, this spell summons a Rod of Mystical 
        Transvergence for everyone within 300 feet. This rod is no drop and 
        contains 3 charges of Mystical Transvergence. Each charge restores 360 
        mana at the cost of 450 health. A player may only use a charge from the 
        rod once every 5 minutes. <br>
        <br>
        Additionally, there will be a new &quot;Rod of Mystical Transvergence&quot; spell 
        for sale in the Bazaar. This is a single target spell that summons a rod 
        with 3 charges of Mystical Transvergence. This rod has the same 
        abilities and restrictions listed above. This spell is a targeted summon 
        that costs 400 points of mana to cast. <br>
        <br>
        Thanks to all the mages that have sent in or posted suggestions on this 
        matter. <br>

        ** Odd New Objects in the Land **<br>
        <br>
        Folks across Norrath and on Luclin have reported seeing odd new objects 
        in various locations. They appear to be some sort of magical portal, 
        though local spell casters have yet to discover how they arrived or 
        exactly what their purpose is. They have determined, however, that these 
        objects are slowly building in power. Attempting to use these portals at 
        this time can have unexpected results. Experts recommend that 
        adventurers avoid these objects until they know more. For more 
        information on these odd devices, visit www.planesofpower.com<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** Important Notice Regarding Alternate Advancement Reimbursement **<br>
        <br>
        Due to the changes made to Manaburn, Rods of Mystical Transvergence and 
        a previous change to Innate Regeneration, we are reimbursing several 
        Alternate Advancement (AA) abilities. <br>
        <br>
        Once you log in today, if you have any of these abilities, please check 
        your AA window immediately! If you have more than 30 unspent points, IT 
        IS VERY IMPORTANT that you make certain that your character has 30 or 
        fewer AA points before The Planes of Power launches on October 21st! The 
        return of these AA points may put your total number of unspent points 
        over the 30 point maximum. Your pool will be reduced to 30 the first 
        time you log in after the launch of Planes of Power on October 21st. <br>
        <br>
        We will be refunding all Alternate Advancement points in the following 
        abilities: <br>
        <br>
        Innate Regeneration<br>
        Manaburn<br>
        Mental Clarity<br>
        Quick Summoning <br>
        <br>
        Refunded Alternate Advancement points may be spent in any way you 
        choose. None of these abilities is being removed, and of them only 
        Manaburn is changing.<br>
        <br>
        NOTE: Cannibalization, Gather Mana, and Mind and Body Rejuvenation will 
        not function if you do not have the necessary prerequisite, Mental 
        Clarity 3.<br>

        <br>
        - Complete Healing will now heal a maximum of 7,500 hit points<br>
        - The Rod of Mystical Transvergence spell has been altered. The spell 
        has been renamed to &quot;Mass Mystical Transvergence&quot;. When cast, this spell 
        summons a Rod of Mystical Transvergence for everyone within 300 feet. 
        This rod is no drop and contains 3 charges of Mystical Transvergence. 
        Each charge restores 360 mana at the cost of 450 health. A player may 
        only use a charge from the rod once every 5 minutes.<br>
        - Additionally, there is a new &quot;Rod of Mystical Transvergence&quot; spell for 
        sale in the Bazaar. This is a single target spell that summons a rod 
        with 3 charges of Mystical Transvergence. This rod has the same 
        abilities and restrictions listed above. This spell is a targeted summon 
        that costs 400 points of mana to cast.<br>
        - Changed the way Focus stacks with other strength and dexterity buffs<br>
        - Circle of Seasons will overwrite Resist Cold<br>
        - Dance of the Blade should now stack with McVaxius's Rousing Rondo<br>
        - Harness of Spirit and Rage should now stack properly<br>
        <br>
        - Fufil's Curtailing Chant should now stack with Occlusion of Sound<br>
        - Protection of the Glades should now overwrite Blessed Armor of the 
        Risen<br>
        - Blessed Armor of the Risen should now stack with Lunar Whispers<br>
        - Fixed a bug that was causing some applications of spells and ranged 
        attacks from great distance to go unnoticed by NPCs<br>
        - Contact Innates (such as Boon of the Garou) should now be working for 
        bards<br>
        - Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause helmets and sometimes hair to 
        disappear after an illusion was cast<br>
        - Bard songs should now blink on recipients other than the bard<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** Interface **<br>
        <br>
        - New Alarm feature added. When you first log in you will see a pop up 
        asking if you wish to set an alarm and if so for how long. There is also 
        an option to choose to never see that pop up again. If you choose this 
        option you will need to set ShowAlarmWindow=TRUE in your eqclient.ini 
        file in order to see the pop up again. The alarm will trigger after the 
        time you set has elapsed, no matter what character you are playing on 
        whatever server, up until the moment you log out.<br>
        - /played now displays how long you have been playing this session and, 
        if an alarm has been set, how long until that alarm sounds.<br>
        - /pet sit down should now work on charmed NPCs<br>
        - Added 3 new context menu options for chat windows: Reply To, Tell a 
        friend, Tell a Raidmember (for future use). Each of which has a submenu 
        containing the list of Reply targets, Friends, or Raidmembers, as 
        appropriate. Clicking on the player's name will place &quot;/tell &lt;name&gt;&quot; on 
        the chat entry line, and move the focus there, closing the menu.<br>
        - Changed /loadskin. It now brings up a window that will allow you to 
        select a skin from a list, determine whether to use the INI or not, then 
        load the skin.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** Beastlords **<br>
        <br>
        In order to allow us to better tune warders, we have made changes to the 
        way that these pets work. Previously a Beastlord would summon a pet 
        using an ability button and then use level-appropriate buff spells to 
        increase the pet's level. Because of the way this mechanic works, it was 
        very difficult to tune these pets. Hopefully this will have the side 
        benefit of making things a little easier on Beastlords by reducing the 
        number of steps required to cast the pet.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Beastlords will now summon their pets using spells rather than an 
        ability. The series of spells that was previously used to buff the pets 
        will now simply summon the appropriate pet.<br>
        <br>
        Unfortunately, these pets will no longer zone with the Beastlord, and 
        will need to be resummoned (instead of rebuffed) after zoning.<br>
        <br>
        We have made some adjustments to these pets already. <br>
        <br>
        - Added the casting time reduction that is already in place for 
        Paladins, Rangers and Shadowknights to Beastlords<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** Items **<br>
        <br>
        - Merchants now highly value the Staff of Forbidden Rites and will only 
        sell them at an extremely high price.<br>
        - Dance of the Blade should once again stack with Nature's Melody and 
        Song of the Deep Seas<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** Trade Skills **<br>
        <br>
        - Made it slightly easier to get skill increases while doing Tailoring, 
        Tinkering, Smithing, Baking, Brewing and Alchemy. Made it slightly more 
        difficult to get skill increases with Pottery and Fletching<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** Miscellaneous **<br>
        <br>
        - Player Character corpses with no items will decay in 3 real life 
        hours, not 7 days<br>
        <br>
        - Fixed a bug that was causing Lay Hands to not heal enough damage<br>
        - Zoning while on a horse on a boat will no longer cause you to appear 
        on the other side in the water<br>
        - /face (face picker) will no longer work while under the effects of an 
        illusion<br>
        - Taunt should be more effective and more dependent on the level of the 
        Taunt skill for PC's and NPC's below level 60.<br>
        - Levitation can no longer be cast on Traders in the Bazaar<br>

        <p><font face="Arial">Due to the upcoming changes to Manaburn, Rods of 
        Mystical Transvergence and a previous change to Innate Regeneration, we 
        will be reimbursing several Alternate Advancement (AA) abilities. This 
        will happen with the next patch (scheduled for 3 am the morning of 
        October 16th). <br>
        <br>
        Once you log on after the patch, if you have any of these abilities, 
        please check your AA window immediately! <br>
        <br>
        If you have more than 30 unspent points, <b>IT IS VERY IMPORTANT that 
        you make certain that your character has 30 or fewer AA points before 
        the launch of Planes of Power on October 21st!</b> The return of these 
        AA points may put your total number of unspent points over the 30 point 
        maximum. Your pool will be reduced to 30 the first time you log in after 
        the launch of Planes of Power on October 21st. <br>
        <br>
        We will be refunding all Alternate Advancement points in the following

        directly affect the Druid Class.&nbsp; This one doesn't directly affect 
        the class, but definitely does indirectly.&nbsp; Thought you should all 
        see it!</font></h1>
        <p>&nbsp;- Spiritual</p>
        <p>From EQLive:</p>
        <h1><font size="3">Development Update, Game Balance</font></h1>
        <p><br>
        Just like everyone else, we're people. People make mistakes.</p>
        <p>Some mistakes aren't that unbalancing and are safe to keep in the 
        game and work around. Others can sometimes yield gameplay that turns out 
        to be even more fun than developers even imagined, as ingenious 
        adventurers discover unrealized potential in their abilities.&nbsp; Yet 
        others, even the best-intentioned ones, can cause an entire style of 
        gameplay to shift dramatically in a direction that no one particularly 
        enjoys.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, today, we need to address a number of the latter 
        kind.&nbsp; For that, we sincerely apologize. It is absolutely our fault that 
        certain abilities have been allowed to grow out of control.</p>
        <p>In our last letter, we stated that our goal for large scale battles 
        in EverQuest was never one of endurance contests. We'd prefer to 
        actively return to the type of battles that everyone feels are more fun 
        - Battles that require tactics and skill, as opposed to attendance and 
        endurance.</p>
        <p>Due to some specific abilities as they exist today in EverQuest, this 
        unfortunately isn't possible. The mathematics simply cannot be made to 
        work. In extreme cases such as that, the abilities themselves must be 
        altered.</p>
        <p>It isn't possible, for example, to ever make another fast-action, 
        do-or-die-quickly style encounter as long as Manaburn exists in its 
        current form, unless it is targeted solely at an entire group of people 
        who have this ability, as it will otherwise be trivial to those who do.</p>
        <p>Likewise, it isn't possible to create encounters that must be 
        completed in a certain amount of time due to mana consumption, when Rods 
        of Mystical Transvergence provide an essentially unlimited source of 
        mana. Every challenging encounter must also be challenging for the 
        massive raid of people who have infinite mana, and the encounter then 
        becomes undoable to those who do not have the infinite supply.</p>
        <p>Hypothetically, the only alternative to changing abilities such as 
        these would be to inflate every other class up to the same tier of 
        relative power (be it damaging power, or mana regenerative power), then 
        inflate the rest of the world to compensate for the sudden rash of new 
        found power. Drastic, world-wide changes of that sort, however, are a 
        guaranteed way to do more harm than good.</p>
        <p>The time has come to address these abilities. Fortunately, after 
        doing so, EverQuest as a whole, and the encounters in Planes of Power, 
        will be able to be tuned for forces who are interested in active 
        participation in the game, as opposed to those forced to sit through yet 
        another 45 minute encounter with a single NPC, as became the norm in 
        Luclin.</p>
        <p><br>
        <strong>* Manaburn</strong>. In addition to the problem described above, 
        this ability was never intended to be a way for small bands of high 
        level players to hold hostage the advancement of larger numbers of more 
        appropriately leveled people. While this was not the universal case, it 
        has unfortunately happened enough across most servers to where it became 
        a large concern in recent months.&nbsp; The concept of someone looking to 
        complete their epic quest via teamwork and overcoming the odds, only to 
        have their attempts obstructed, in some cases, by small teams of players 
        looking to profit financially from their power, quite frankly, is not a 
        behavior that we wish the game to reinforce.</p>
        <p>In the next patch, Wizards who have purchased Manaburn will find that 
        their ability points have been refunded. Please make sure that you have 
        fewer than 25 pooled Ability points.</p>
        <p>At that point, they will be able to purchase a new Manaburn if they 
        choose, which has most of the power of the old one. However, the new 
        Manaburn leaves a temporary effect on its target when used that&nbsp; does 
        not stack with other Manaburns.&nbsp; The delay that we will be tuning on the 
        Test Server soon will allow a single target to be manaburned no more 
        frequently than once every minute. </p>
        <p>Hopefully, this will bring the ability back in line with the original 
        intent -- A powerful ability that allows a Wizard to do massive 
        short-term damage, but not a method for a group of wizards to destroy 
        powerful creatures with zero risk. </p>
        <p><br>
        <strong>* Rods of Mystical Transvergence</strong>. The description above 
        shows how this spell has perhaps singlehandedly altered the balance of 
        the end-game encounter by turning it into an event where the largest 
        challenge is setting up a timed rotation of Complete Healing.&nbsp; Once that 
        is established, in many cases, the event is just as playable by leaving 
        AutoAttack on, and wandering away to watch television. This does not 
        make for stellar interactive content.</p>
        <p>We view Magicians as an excellent source of damage, especially with 
        the many pet enhancements that have been made over the past year. To be 
        honest, it is a more than a small shame that their full energies have 
        been viewed as &quot;needed&quot; to be spent, full-time, purely on transferring 
        their mana to others. Magicians are supposed to be the masters of 
        elemental conjuration and highly respected as a damage-dealer, not the 
        masters of mana transferrence.</p>
        <p>In the next update, Rods of Mystical Transvergence will be changed so 
        that the spell summons an item that is still a valuable upgrade over the 
        original Modulation Rod, yet does not provide an infinite amount of 
        mana.&nbsp; The idea of sudden mana gain spells is only balanced if there is 
        a net loss over time to counteract the rapid infusion.&nbsp; The initial 
        version of the spell that we will be testing summons a Rod containing a 
        single charge of 360 mana for 450 hit points, and can only be used by a 
        person once each minute.</p>
        <p>In addition, the Rods themselves will be non-droppable, and spell 
        will turn into a &quot;target based summon,&quot; such that the Magician summons 
        them directly onto the recipient, as opposed to having to hand them out 
        manually or create a stockpile on the ground.</p>
        <p>Since there are definitely encounters in the game where this type of 
        mana regeneration is mandatory for the encounter to be beaten by a 
        reasonably sized force, a number of those encounters will likewise be 
        re-tuned to shorten their duration, most frequently by lowering the hit 
        points on the NPC in question.</p>
        <p>Again, our intent here is provide Magicians with a desirable 
        secondary ability that would ideally be used before a battle, not an 
        ability which essentially compels them to suddenly transform into a 
        full-time support role, transferring their mana to others, as opposed to 
        dealing damage. </p>
        <p><br>
        <strong>* Complete Healing</strong>. The concept of any class getting 
        their single best, most efficient primary ability at level 39, has never 
        sat well with most people. In the days of characters having a maximum of 
        2000-4000 hit points, the spell was absolutely not imbalancing. However, 
        as time went on and characters progressed, now doubling that amount of 
        hit points, it becomes obvious that the spell must be scaled back 
        slightly.</p>
        <p>This spell has, over time, become the defining cornerstone of the 
        Cleric class. As such, it cannot be altered significantly. Taking that 
        into account, and given that those with the most hit points in EverQuest 
        have yet to hit the full 10,000 HP cap of this spell, the spell will 
        remain nearly as useful as it is today, by being reclassified as a spell 
        that heals for 7,500 hit points, down from its current cap of 10,000.</p>
        <p>This will allow it to continue to be used as it has been in the past, 
        while allowing for more dynamic types of heals to be introduced in the 
        future. Making this change will allow us to providing more entertaining 
        high-end encounters that require more active involvement than setting up 
        a Complete Healing &quot;Rotation&quot; or &quot;Chain,&quot; then repeating the same 
        motions until the Large Thing you are facing, eventually falls down.</p>
        <p><br>
        <strong>* Monk Defense</strong>.&nbsp; Finally, the issue of defensive 
        ability needs to be addressed with respect to Monks.&nbsp; Monks in EverQuest 
        were originally intended to be a class with excellent offensive 
        potential, both with and without equipment.&nbsp; This ability came at the 
        expense of having only passable defensive abilities, partially in the 
        form of an extremely small, restrictive selection of equipment from 
        which to choose.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>This, of course, caused its own series of problems of how to 
        adequately reward the person behind the character.&nbsp; It did not take long 
        for universally equippable items (ALL/ALL items) to be considered by and 
        large as &quot;Monk Loot,&quot; as far back as before the launch of Kunark.</p>
        <p>Over time, Monks' defensive abilities had been tuned up to correct a 
        perceived weakness.&nbsp; This, taken in combination with a few years of 
        universally equippable, low-weight, high powered items entering the 
        game, slowly transformed Monks into what is arguably the strongest 
        defensive class in the game.&nbsp; Monks get hit less than any other class, 
        and due to the tuning over time, no longer take appreciably more damage 
        when they do get hit.</p>
        <p>This imbalance between the classes does need to be addressed in order 
        for the Plate-wearing classes in the game to have their proper relative 
        power.&nbsp; The Plate-wearing classes in the game take a serious penalty to 
        their offensive abilities in order to defend as well as they can, and we 
        cannot fix this problem solely by inflating their defensive abilities to 
        compensate for this.&nbsp; Again, that type of change would harm EverQuest as 
        a whole much more than altering the one class.&nbsp; Likewise, we have no 
        desire to retroactively alter all of the equipment in the game that is 
        contributing to this problem.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Monk defense will be altered somewhat.&nbsp; It is no secret that in 
        EverQuest, a character's Armor Class does not compare equally across 
        different classes.&nbsp; (A Wizard with 1000 AC defends differently than a 
        Warrior with 1000AC, for example.)&nbsp; It's not the most optimal system, 
        for sure, but it is the one that many people have had much time to get 
        used to.&nbsp; As such, Monk defense will be altered such that they may 
        continue wearing the same equipment, however, they will get a decreased 
        benefit to their overall ability to take damage.</p>
        <p>Again, we have no desire to make monks unable to take any type of 
        punishment -- far from it.&nbsp; What we are primarily striving for is 
        maintaining the defensive order of the Plate classes being able to take 
        the most punishment, followed by the Chain classes and Monks.&nbsp; The 
        latter being technically a Leather wearing class who will continue to 
        make up the difference by being able to avoid more blows than the rest.</p>
        <p>In closing, we would like to again apologize for the amount of time 
        that we've allowed these abilites to remain in their current state. With 
        Planes of Power on the horizon, in order to make encounters that most 
        people would consider &quot;fun,&quot; these abilities and class attributes need 
        to be brought back into line as sane upgrades and logical progressions, 
        as opposed to their current manifestations.</p>
        <p>We appreciate the many well thought-out letters that have been sent 
        in on these topics and more.&nbsp; As always, we thank you for playing 
        EverQuest and look forward to seeing you soon in the Planes of Power.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">In the past, and even at the 
        writing of this [...], experience on raids would generally go to a 
        single group or a few groups. The group doing the most damage would get 
        the experience on any given kill. But, perhaps even at the time you are 
        reading this [...], that will be changed by a new Raid feature. </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Because the system is still 
        being worked on as this is written, some of the details may change by 
        the time it is implemented. However, we'll give you the planned 
        functionality as it stands at this time. </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The Raid system is intended 
        to aid in the formation and organizing raids and make looting on raids a 
        little more manageable. At the same time, it allows a certain amount of 
        experience to be shared among all members of a raid. The basics of the 
        system work very much like grouping has always worked. The Raid Leader 
        is the leader of all the raid groups and the group leaders remain 
        leaders of their individual groups. </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Alt-R or /raidwindow will 
        toggle the new Raid Window. This window works much like the group 
        window. You can invite people to the raid (if you are the raid leader) 
        and see a list of the folks in your raid, along with the status of those 
        members (Raid Leader, Group Leader or raid member - which shows with no 
        rank). It also shows you the group number of the individual members. </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">If a Raid Leader invites an 
        individual (someone not in a group), that person joins the raid as a 
        Raid Group Leader. If the Raid Leader invites a member of a group, the 
        entire group joins the raid, and their group leader becomes a Raid Group 
        Leader. </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">A Raid Group Leader can

        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Only a Raid Leader can remove 
        someone from the raid. He or she does so simply by clicking on the 
        character's name in the raid window and clicking the Disband button 
        (also in the raid window). </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Just like groups, raids have 
        their own chat channel. /rsay works for the raid just as /gsay does for 
        groups. Just like group chat, you can set this to be your default 
        channel for a given chat window by choosing it from the right-click 
        Default Channel context menu. </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Experience for killing NPCs 
        will be distributed to all members of the raid that are within range. 
        However, the experience given will be smaller than the experience that 
        would be earned by a single group. Generally, unless you are fighting 
        NPCs that require a raid, you will still be better off earning 
        experience with the old fashioned six-person group. </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Raids will definitely allow 
        for larger than traditional groups, however, much of EverQuest is 
        designed with the six-person group in mind. Adding a small number of 
        people to a given group will allow this &quot;oversized&quot; group to gain 
        experience. However, we recommend that once a &quot;raid&quot; of ten or more 
        people forms, a second, traditional group split off and adventure on 
        their own. </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The Raid Leader determines 
        the looting permissions for any NPC killed by the raid. There are three
