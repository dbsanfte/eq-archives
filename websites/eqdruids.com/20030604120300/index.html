        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">So I
        <a href="http://www.gucomics.com/commissions/">commissioned</a> one of 
        the leading EQ Comic artists, Woody over at

        There are indeed a few quests actually handled by bankers. Because 
        bankers can no longer accept items, those quests can't be completed. We 
        hope to have those specific quests addressed soon. <br>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Someone mentioned that they had heard 
        that Norton Antivirus with auto protection was slowing down EQ.&nbsp; So 
        we decided to run some tests.&nbsp; Our results shocked even us.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">We clocked login time, and then zone 
        time for each instance.&nbsp; To clock the zone time, we stepped off the 
        same edge of Kelethin and waited to see how long it took for us to load 
        after death.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">With Autoprotect running.&nbsp; We 
        had a loading time of 223 seconds from clicking on the EQ icon to 
        actually being in the game.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">With Autoprotect turned off.&nbsp; We 
        had a loading time of 191 seconds from clicking on the EQ icon to 
        actually being in the game.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">This is almost a 17% difference in 
        speed!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Next we did our death test.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">With Autoprotect running.&nbsp; After 
        dying it took 30 seconds to zone.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">With Autoprotect turned off.&nbsp; 
        After dying it took 25 seconds to zone.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Again almost a 17% difference in 
        speed!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">To verify our results we tried 
        several other programs.&nbsp; Loading a very large Word document we saw 
        almost a 50% faster loading time with the Autoprotect turned off, than 
        on.&nbsp; In Photoshop we reduced a 45 meg image down to a 450k image.&nbsp; 
        The speed difference also showed there but not as dramatically.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The only conclusion we can draw from 
        these tests is that if the program you are running is loading from the 
        disk often, the program will run 15-17% faster with Autoprotect off.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Now before you run out and turn off 
        your autoprotection.&nbsp; I am not saying to do that!&nbsp; Norton's 
        autoprotection definitely has a purpose on your system.&nbsp; However, 
        if you are going to be raiding or having a hard time with lag while in 
        EQ this might be an option to help reduce problems (just turn 
        autoprotect back on when you are done playing!!)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">For those curious, these tests were 
        run on a Pentium 4 computer with 512 megs of ram running Windows XP 
        home.&nbsp; I did run other programs in the background to make this test 
        &quot;real life&quot; but those background programs were the exact same programs 
        through each test.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">I'm not saying that Norton Antivirus 
        is at fault here, it could very easily be a conflict between Antivirus 
        software and Windows itself (there have been other incidents of Windows 
        and Antivirus programs butting heads) but this is something to be aware 
        of.</font></p>
