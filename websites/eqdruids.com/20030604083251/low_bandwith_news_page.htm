News Page!</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial">Up and coming to EQDruids 6/2/03</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">To give folks an idea of what is up and 
coming.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">I have had huge amounts of requests for 
EQDruids to start doing t-shirts and the like.&nbsp; So after a lot of 
consideration we decided to do this!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Now I couldn't just go out and find some 
cheesy drawing and slap it on a t-shirt.&nbsp; Not with all the support you 
folks have shown us.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">So I
<a href="http://www.gucomics.com/commissions/">commissioned</a> one of the 
leading EQ Comic artists, Woody over at <a href="http://www.gucomics.com/">
/GUComics</a>, to make us a proper picture worthy of you all.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Let me tell you what!&nbsp; He did it!!&nbsp; 
The drawing is FANTASTIC!!&nbsp; I've previewed this image to a few folks and 
the staff and we are all completely blown away by how nice it turned out!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">So over the next few weeks we will be setting 
up to take orders for T-Shirts, Posters and Mousepads.&nbsp; We actually will 
have many more options available to us, but those are the three that we feel 
will be the most popular to start and we'll add the others quickly. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">I've seen samples of what these items are 
going to look like and I can honestly tell you they are going to look so good 
you won't believe your eyes!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">So now that we have a new image to use, 
what's next?&nbsp; Well of course we can't just use it for printed items!&nbsp; 
We'll be doing a redesign of the site to go along with these new items!&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Over the next few weeks you will probably 
notice a lot of changes.&nbsp; Don't worry if something creeps into the current 
website, we're working hard at setting it all up!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Thank you all again for the amazing amount of 
support you have shown us here at EQDruids.&nbsp; We wouldn't be here without 
all of you!&nbsp; </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Welp I've looked all over for a pic of the 
drawings we are giving away and I can't find one.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Worse I'm not going to have a chance to take 
actual pics it looks like between now and then, so you will just have to trust 
me when I say these are very cool little sketches :)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">I know the monthly drawing should have taken 
place today and my only excuse for it not happening was I forgot it was the end 
of the month due to real life craziness.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">So this one time I'm going to move the 
drawing to the 5th of the month to give me time to put up some pics of the 
drawing and finish some other things :)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">I'll announce the prize, it will be some VERY 
nice illustrations that are copies of the concept art used in making the models 
for EQ.&nbsp; There are very fun to look at, and are a great addition to 
anyone's EQ collection :)</font></p>

There are indeed a few quests actually handled by bankers. Because bankers can 
no longer accept items, those quests can't be completed. We hope to have those 
specific quests addressed soon. <br>

Sorry for the problem. <br>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Someone mentioned that they had heard that 
Norton Antivirus with auto protection was slowing down EQ.&nbsp; So we decided 
to run some tests.&nbsp; Our results shocked even us.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">We clocked login time, and then zone time for 
each instance.&nbsp; To clock the zone time, we stepped off the same edge of 
Kelethin and waited to see how long it took for us to load after death.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">With Autoprotect running.&nbsp; We had a 
loading time of 223 seconds from clicking on the EQ icon to actually being in 
the game.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">With Autoprotect turned off.&nbsp; We had a 
loading time of 191 seconds from clicking on the EQ icon to actually being in 
the game.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">This is almost a 17% difference in speed!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Next we did our death test.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">With Autoprotect running.&nbsp; After dying 
it took 30 seconds to zone.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">With Autoprotect turned off.&nbsp; After 
dying it took 25 seconds to zone.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Again almost a 17% difference in speed!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">To verify our results we tried several other 
programs.&nbsp; Loading a very large Word document we saw almost a 50% faster 
loading time with the Autoprotect turned off, than on.&nbsp; In Photoshop we 
reduced a 45 meg image down to a 450k image.&nbsp; The speed difference also 
showed there but not as dramatically.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The only conclusion we can draw from these 
tests is that if the program you are running is loading from the disk often, the 
program will run 15-17% faster with Autoprotect off.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Now before you run out and turn off your 
autoprotection.&nbsp; I am not saying to do that!&nbsp; Norton's autoprotection 
definitely has a purpose on your system.&nbsp; However, if you are going to be 
raiding or having a hard time with lag while in EQ this might be an option to 
help reduce problems (just turn autoprotect back on when you are done playing!!)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">For those curious, these tests were run on a 
Pentium 4 computer with 512 megs of ram running Windows XP home.&nbsp; I did run 
other programs in the background to make this test &quot;real life&quot; but those 
background programs were the exact same programs through each test.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">I'm not saying that Norton Antivirus is at 
fault here, it could very easily be a conflict between Antivirus software and 
Windows itself (there have been other incidents of Windows and Antivirus 
programs butting heads) but this is something to be aware of.</font></p>
