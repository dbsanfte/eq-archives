        There has been a lot of rumors going around recently after shipping date 
        changes were made by Amazon in the United Kingdom which pushed the 
        release date of the Planes of Power expansion back to December.&nbsp; Players 
        curious as to why the major online distributor had pushed the release 
        date back two months reportedly discovered that the shipment date for 
        European players had been altered to coincide with the new localized 
        service in Europe.</p>
        <p>Some time ago Ubisoft &amp; Sony Online Entertainment entered into an 
        agreement to provide localized EverQuest service to Europe.&nbsp; Known as 
        EverQuest Renaissance, this service would see European players receive 
        the ability to play EverQuest without language barriers opening the 
        French and German speaking communities up to the massively multiplayer 
        online role-playing game.</p>
        <p>It's been speculated for some time that once the service was put live 
        that new purchases of EverQuest distributed by Ubisoft in Europe would 
        not be able to connect to Sony operated servers in the United States as 
        the subscription fees for European sold EQ boxes are being used to fund 
        the Ubisoft servers and customer service systems in Europe.</p>
        <p>Recently it appeared that this system would also be applied to 
        existing players with the purchase of the Planes of Power expansion.&nbsp; 
        Namely, that existing players who purchased a European retail box for 
        Planes of Power would only be able to use the upgrade keys on European 
        servers.&nbsp; This was on top of the already existing concerns of a December 
        release.</p>
        <p>John Smedley, COO of Sony Online, made the following announcement:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><i>I wanted to clear up some misconceptions that are floating 
          around: </i></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><i>1) European and UK players will be able to get Planes of Power 
            on or around October 21st. We will be offering Planes of Power on a 
            Pre-Order basis to these customers and will attempt to keep the 
            shipping costs extremely reasonable to make sure they don't have to 
            pay a ton to get it sent over. </i></p>
            <p><i>2) We are still working out the exact date of the launch of 
            Planes of Power in the UK and Europe with our partners at UbiSoft. 
            The rumors swirling around now are just that. </i></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><i>We very much value our European and UK customers. We're simply 
          coordinating all of this with the launch of the new localized service 
          with UbiSoft. </i></p>
          <p><i>More information will follow. </i></p>
          <p><i>Thanks very much, </i></p>
          <p><i>John Smedley <br>
          Chief Operating Officer <br>
          Sony Online Entertainment </i></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>While this system will help players somewhat in Europe to at least 
        get their hands on a box it does unfortunately severely limit players 
        options with regards to pre-ordering as other online distributors such 
        as EB World (which only ships to some European countries as it is) has 
        shipping costs near to or even over the cost of the expansion itself.&nbsp; 
        The proposal from SOE would see them as virtually the sole distributor 
        for the title if shipping costs are going to be made as feasible as 
        stated.</p>
        <p>Another question which must be asked is what this will mean for the 
        future distribution of other expansions in Europe and the release of the 
        expansion to other countries such as the Asia/Pacific sector.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>It is interesting to note that one of the best aspects of MMORPG's, 
        the international community building from players all over the world, 
        would appear to be under increasing threat as companies pursue better 
        financial returns from licencing deals and localization.&nbsp; Another title 
        which has also attracted attention from the use of this localizaed 
        implementation is the Shadowbane title with whom Ubisoft is also 
        involved.</p>
        <p>We will keep you updated as more information is released from Sony on 
        this matter.</font></td>

        ------------------------------ <br>
        <br>
        ** Planes of Power Pre-Order Bonus ** <br>
        <br>
        If you pre-order the PoP expansion you will be able to purchase the 
        Planes of Power original soundtrack CD for just an additional $4.95. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        *** Important Notice about Alternate Advancement *** <br>
        <br>
        - When a character has 30 or more AA points, they will receive a red 
        message stating: <br>
        <br>
        Warning: You are currently over the earned Advancement point limit of 
        30. Please spend some of your stored AA points. You will not be able to 
        earn further AA points until you have fewer than 30. On October 21, 
        2002, all points over 30 in your AA pool will be deleted. <br>
        <br>
        It seems appropriate that Advancement points earned prior to the release 
        of Planes of Power be used for abilities from earlier expansions. In 
        addition, many of the Luclin abilities are pre-requisites for Planes of 
        Power abilities. When the servers come up on October 21st, all unused 
        Alternate Advancement point pools over 30 will be wiped. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** New Spell Effects ** <br>
        <br>
        We are implementing a few new spell effects using our new particle 
        effects engine with this patch as a way of easing into the new system. 
        The new effects are faster and give you more control over how they look. 
        We have changed the Display Options menu to accommodate these new 
        options. <br>
        <br>
        On the Display tab of the options window you will now find four options 
        regarding particle effects. The first three, listed under Spell 
        Particles are Near Clip Plane, Density and Opacity. These are the 
        options for controlling the new particle effects. They will not change 
        the old particle effects. The old particles are controlled using the 
        Other Particles option. <br>
        <br>
        Note on Near Clip Plane: This option chooses how close to you particles 
        cease to be visible. So Near allows particles to be seen right up to the 
        character. Farthest will clip out particles near the character and only 
        show those at the 'farthest' distance. <br>
        <br>
        Note on Opacity: This feature works at all settings for cards that 
        support TnL. For other cards setting Opacity to 0% will turn off the 
        effects and any other setting will show them fully. <br>
        <br>
        We'll leave it up to you to discover which spells have the new 
        particles... <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** Alternate Advancement ** <br>
        <br>
        - Beastlords now have access to the Mend Companion ability. <br>
        - Beastlords now have access to three unique class alternate 
        advancements. <br>
        - Permanent Illusion used with Wolf Form should no longer result in a 
        wolf tinted by the Enchanter's robe. <br>
        - Updated Finishing Blow - <br>
        &quot;This ability gives you a chance to finish off an NPC that is below 10 
        percent health and fleeing with a single blow. The first level works on 
        NPC's below 50, the second on NPC's below 52, and the third on NPC's 
        below 54. (Non-Warriors must first train one level of Combat Fury to use 
        this ability.) &quot; <br>
        - Improved Combat Fury for non-warriors to give more value to the points 
        spent after level 1. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** Spells ** <br>
        <br>
        - New Druid and Shaman heal spells are available. <br>
        - The &quot;Your XXX Spell Has Worn Off&quot; messages for DoT spells will now go 
        to the right character. <br>
        - Illusions that are of a character type that can't wear armor, such as 
        werewolf, will no longer cause the character to be naked when the 
        illusion drops. <br>
        - Fixed the Illusion wolf form swimming animation. <br>
        - Shaman and Beastlord Shrink spell has had its location restriction 
        removed. <br>
        - The outcasts of Echo Caverns have deciphered new magics that allow 
        Dark Knights to channel the essence of terror into their enemies minds. 
        While their initial findings have proven very powerful, rumors exist of 
        even greater magics that might channel the nightmares of Terris Thule 
        herself into the minds of mortals. Where that power might be found is 
        not yet known. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** Items ** <br>
        <br>
        - Items that grant bonuses to bandage skill should be working now. <br>
        - Guise of the Hunter no longer makes the user appear to be naked. <br>
        - Validus Custodus Battle Axe no longer looks like a bard mandolin when 
        equipped by a pet. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** PvP Servers and Gameplay ** <br>
        <br>
        - The recent resist changes have been adjusted for PvP. They will not be 
        exactly as they were prior to the resist change, but they should be 
        reasonable now. Please let us know if you feel they need further 
        adjustment. <br>
        - Player characters will no longer lose experience in the Arena areas on 
        the Sullon Zek server. <br>
        - A player character can no longer tell his pet to attack another 
        player's horse when not on a PvP area or in a duel. <br>
        - Kael, Skyshrine, and Thurgadin on Sullon Zek no longer have the newbie 
        protection code active. <br>
        - Players should once again be able to use level-restricted clickable 
        buffs on the Sullon Zek server. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** Pets ** <br>
        <br>
        - Improved Beastlord pets to scale more reasonably with the level of the 
        Beastlord after level 40. This also puts them into line with the last 
        round of pet balancing, which did not improve beastlord pets at the 
        time. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** Horses ** <br>
        <br>
        - Locate corpse songs/spells should now work on horseback. <br>
        - Detect traps should also now work on horseback. <br>
        - Fixed a bug that was preventing manipulation of inventory items if a 
        character died with coins on the cursor. <br>
        - Invisibility on horseback should now make your horse invisible to NPCs 
        as it does the rider. <br>
        - Zoning with Levitate/Levitation and horse no longer causes the 
        levitation to fail. <br>
        - Fixed a bug that would cause the horse 'buff' to disappear when zoning 
        in some zones. <br>
        - Player characters on horseback can now be hit by various missiles, 
        such as arrows, thrown weapons or the various bolt spells from PCs and 
        NPCs. <br>
        - Call of the Hero should no longer put people under the world when the 
        caster is on horseback. <br>
        - Dragging a corpse while on a horse will no longer cause the corpse 
        fall under the world. <br>
        - You can now right click on spells to arrange your spell book when on a 
        horse. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** Zone Specific ** <br>
        <br>
        - We believe that we fixed the major source of lockups caused for 
        players in certain zones such as the Great Divide and Shadowhaven. <br>
        - Hierophant Oxyn in East Cabilis will be showing up again. <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        ** An Ancient Arises ** <br>
        <br>
        Deep within the recesses of a cave yet unknown to the world at large, a 
        dark, menacing figure parts with the slumber that has kept him silent 
        for ages. The eyes of a magnificently ominous beast pierce through the 
        darkness, his memories flowing freely once more. In the depths of this 
        beast's mind sparks the knowledge that his prophetic savior has been 
        released from the ancient magiks of time, let loose upon an unsuspecting 
        world where the kin shall once again reign supreme. <br>
        <br>
        &quot;My master's shackles have been trounced, and so it is written that in 
        this world that has been so deftly overrun by pitiful mortals, he shall 
        bring power back to those of the scale.&quot; The deep rumbling voice of the 
        beast lingers throughout the cavernous hideaway, the barely 
        distinguishable figure of a mighty lizard moves through the stone and 
        dirt and dust as if to leave the gloomy surroundings and find his place 
        once again upon Norrath proper. <br>
        <br>
        &quot;For far too long have I been a prisoner to the overwhelming might that 
        kept me in a state of secluded sleep; for far too long have I been 
        victim to the ancestral elemental forces keeping my master at bay. Now I 
        awaken and bring life back to the disciples; now shall the lifeblood of 
        the Four once again spread the word of prophecy!&quot; The footsteps of this 
        great beast are slow but sure, moving through the depths of the gaping 
        mountain retreat towards the surface. Along the walls, pebbles and 
        stones that have remained dormant for years crumble and crack, falling 
        to the ground as the immense beast walks past. <br>
        <br>
        A maze of dead ends and broken paths twists and turns in the expanse 
        beyond the figure's resting place. The skeletons of those who had tried 
        - and failed - to make their way to him in the years he spent in forced 
        slumber remain, tumbled landmarks of heroes long lost. Slowly he moves, 
        his reptilian eyes darting back and forth looking for any meager meals 
        that may still be available. As he proceeds, he steps atop a mighty 
        echelon, overlooking the bodies that could not defy the magical 
        properties of the cave; fools of mortal thought, incapable of fathoming 
        the power that lay beyond them. &quot;Time has been good to you, my faithful 
        warren... let us both pray that I no longer need you. The time for the 
        revival is at hand.&quot;</font></td>

        Online Entertainment to launch localized version of EverQuest® in 
        Mainland China</font></b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Paris, FRANCE - September 19, 2002</b> 
        - Ubi Soft® Entertainment, one of the world's largest video game 
        publishers, and Sony Online Entertainment Inc. (SOE), a worldwide leader 
        in Massively Multiplayer Online gaming, today announced an exclusive 
        publishing agreement to release EverQuest® in Mainland China. SOE will 
        bring its already-acquired technological expertise to the partnership 
        while Ubi Soft's online arm, ubi.com, will provide the necessary local 
        infrastructures to host and operate the game.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Ubi Soft sees the move as a great 
        opportunity to reinforce its presence in Asia, which is the number one 
        market when it comes to online gaming. Through this deal, SOE is excited 
        to bring the largest and most beautiful virtual environment to the 
        world's largest population. Chinese gamers have been eager to access 
        EverQuest, the world's most popular MMO game for a long time. Being huge 
        fans of fantasy role-playing games, they will finally be able to immerse 
        themselves in one of the most detailed 3D worlds ever created </font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">At the beginning of 2003, Chinese MMO 
        gamers will join the more than 430,000 players already subscribed around 
        the world to EverQuest and its top-selling expansions The Ruins of 
        Kunark™, The Scars of Velious™ and The Shadows of Luclin™. The latest 
        expansion to the critically acclaimed EverQuest series, EverQuest: The 
        Planes of Power™ launches in the U.S. on October 21, 2002. In line with 
        Ubi Soft's strategy to adapt its games to countries and cultures around 
        the globe, the game will be fully localized, requiring the translation 
        of more than 1.5 million words in Chinese. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">&quot;I am delighted to strengthen our 
        already fruitful partnership with SOE by expanding our online presence 
        in Asia,&quot; said Gilles Langourieux, managing director of ubi.com. &quot;We are 
        tapping into a significant new source of revenue, and are especially 
        proud to introduce the best 3D MMO game to China.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">&quot;As online gaming continues to grow in 
        popularity, EverQuest is truly creating a global online community,&quot; said 
        John Smedley, senior vice president and chief operating officer, Sony 
        Online Entertainment. &quot;With localization efforts in Europe, Korea and 
        now mainland China, we are working with leading companies like Ubi Soft 
        to continually expand EverQuest to meet increasing global demand.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Ubi Soft is the leading publisher of 
        video games in China, with more than 230 employees in its Shanghai, 
        Beijing and Guangzhou offices. With a total of 13 million MMO gamers - 
        including 5 million already paying for online games on a regular basis* 
        - China represents enormous market potential for Ubi Soft and SOE.
        </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">In a related development, SOE and Ubi 
        Soft are actively preparing a localized version of EverQuest® in Europe, 
        called EverQuest® Renaissance, to be released this fall. In order to 
        better cater to European players, two new Web sites - 
        www.everquest-europe.com and www.eqloft.com - are being launched in 
        English, French and German this month</font></td>

        <p><font face="Arial">For Planes of Power there will be two forms of 
        character advancement: level increase and Planar Advancement.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The level cap will increase to 65.&nbsp; Those 
        levels will have inherent benefits much like previous levels.&nbsp; 
        However, they will not be exactly the same.&nbsp; The rate of 
        advancement in character levels is designed to feel more natural and not 
        take the punishing time commitment required between 51 and 60.&nbsp; We 
        understand the frustration that painfully long levels can cause, and 
        hope not to repeat that experience for players.&nbsp; This, combined 
        with the new bonuses for fighting higher level opponents, should make 
        leveling seem less like something that you have to do and more like 
        something that just happens as you play.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Level advancement is closely tied to Planar 
        Advancement.&nbsp; The systems compliment each other.&nbsp; Planar 
        advancement includes extensions on the Alternate Advancement system, 
        along with new abilities for all classes.&nbsp; Advancing your character 
        is a combination of traditional leveling and advancement through planar 
        abilities.&nbsp; Players who enjoy pure leveling can do so, and people 
        that prefer a combination of level advancement and investment in 
        specific abilities can do that as well.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">That's the basic plan for advancement in Planes of 
        Power.&nbsp; We'll continue to refine and tune the specific details as 
        we go through the remaining six weeks of beta testing.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Many of the game balancing and system changes 
        you've seen in Live EverQuest over the last few months have been done 
        with this future advancement in mind.&nbsp; Expect to see more balancing 
        that allows us to once again develop high end content that does not 
        involve marathon battles that are more about attendance and endurance 
        than tactics and skill (e.g. The first time people rounded the corner, 
        stared Trakanon square in the face, and knew they had mere minutes to 
        win or lose, as opposed to the second hour of an end-game encounter.)&nbsp; 
        Creating Planes of Power has been as much about reevaluating existing 
        gameplay as it has been about creating new gameplay.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">We believe that advancement should be fun and 
        rewarding.&nbsp; We are very aware of the issues that players are not 
        enjoying in current gameplay and some of the mechanics introduced with 
        other expansions.&nbsp; We plan to avoid contrived &quot;timesinks&quot;, so that 
        you'll be playing rather than just spending time.&nbsp; This is not to 
        say that success in Planes of Power doesn't require some time, we just 
        want it to be time that you can enjoy.&nbsp; And even though this is a 
        high level expansion, there will be ways for both casual and hardcore 
        players to advance.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">That is as much detail as we can give you right 
        now.&nbsp; We appreciate your patience, and we hope that you'll enjoy 
        Planes of Power.</font></p>

        <font face="Arial">Todays patch had a TON of changes that will affect 
        druids.&nbsp; I'll list the ones that I've seen in the patch message:</font><ul>
          <li>** Keyrings ** <br>
          <br>
          We will be resetting all keyrings with this patch. This will mean that 
          all existing keys in the keyrings will be removed. You will need to 
          place keys back onto the keyrings. Keys are added to the keyring by 
          using the key. The keyring is a part of the character, not a space in 
          inventory. To find out what keys you have just type /key and the game 
          will give you a list. If you have recently deleted a key, please 
          contact your GM for a replacement. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>** Experience Changes ** <br>
          <br>
          - We have smoothed out level progression from 50-60. This should 
          mitigate the &quot;penalty effect&quot; that occurs in levels 51, 54 and 59. 
          Note that it will cost the same experience to level from 50 to 60 as 
          it did before. Also, death experience loss will appear different in 
          some levels. This is an unfortunate side effect that must remain to 
          prevent some experience exploits. <br>
          - We have rebalanced the rewards for killing NPCs for characters over 
          level 50. NPCs that are considerably weaker than you will give you 
          less experience. NPCs give more experience the higher level they are, 
          and for the best results you should fight the most challenging 
          monsters you can reasonably manage. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>** Spells ** <br>
          <br>
          - Fixed the &quot;You have been healed for X damage&quot; message. It once again 
          reports the actual amount of damage healed.</li>
          <li>- Added a message telling the caster when NPC can't be charmed.</li>
          <li>- Fixed a bug that was allowing focused and Alternate Advancement 
          ability enhanced damage spells to do more damage than they should 
          (meaning that both the Alternate Advancement and the Focus improve the 
          base damage. The focus damage was never supposed to compound with the 
          added AA damage.) <br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>- Higher level PCs will be more resistant to lower level NPCs' 
          spells. <br>
          - Increased the number of spells that can be in effect on a given NPC 
          to 30.</li>
          <li>** Spell Stacking Changes ** <br>
          We've made two changes to the way spells stack. <br>
          <br>
          Damage Over Time (DoT) spells are spells that linger on the target 
          doing damage. Until today two different characters could not have the 
          same DoT spell on the same target. As long as one copy of the spell 
          was active any new version of the spell would not take hold. After 
          today the same DoT spell cast by different casters can affect the same 
          target at the same time. Also, if you cast a DoT spell on a target and 
          you already have that spell active on it, the spell will refresh. 
          (Note: It will not be possible to stack Lifeburn). <br>
          <br>
          This does not allow for inferior spells to stack along with superior 
          spells. (Example: Two Necromancers can both land Boil Blood on the 
          same target. However, Heat Blood, being an inferior spell, will still 
          not stack.) <br>
          <br>
          Several DoT spells that have debuff components such as Tuyen's Chant 
          of Frost and Breath of Ro will not stack due to the balance issues of 
          having several hundred points of Resistance debuffs on a single NPC.
          <br>
          <br>
          We've also rewritten the way that spells stack with other spells with 
          the same benefits (for example, to spells that give bonus hit points). 
          Generally speaking spells may now 'bounce' off each other (neither 
          overwriting the other) and stacking issues should now be easier to 
          resolve. In specific: <br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>- Druid Damage Shields should now all stack in the correct order.
          <br>
          - Druid HP buffs are no longer overwriting stronger cleric HP buffs.
          <br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>** Resistance Changes ** <br>
          <br>
          We've made some fairly drastic changes to the way the spell resistance 
          system works. Previously, there was only the smallest benefit to 
          having resists over a certain value. We've reworked resistance in its 
          entirety, completely replacing the old system with one that is more 
          logical. <br>
          <br>
          The idea behind the changes is pretty simple: Resists should matter in 
          a way that makes sense. <br>
          <br>
          Important things to note about the new resistance system: <br>
          <br>
          - Resists matter more for PCs. There are now tangible differences 
          between having 50, 150, and 250 in a given resistance, for example. 
          Resistance buffs, bard songs, and resist gear have actual value, all 
          the way up the line. <br>
          <br>
          - Conversely, resistances also matter more for NPCs. Some NPCs became 
          more vulnerable to things they have always been vulnerable to, other 
          NPCs became more resistant to things that they were inclined to be 
          somewhat resistant to. <br>
          <br>
          - Resistance debuffs should also have more value, all the way up the 
          line. For the first time, resistance debuffs now have the ability to 
          bring NPCs that were lure-style only down into the range of being hit 
          by normal spells. <br>
          <br>
          - The hard level limit involving players casting on NPCs has been 
          removed. This used to be referred to in EQ folklore as the &quot;Six Level 
          Limit&quot; (It was actually 1.25 times the caster's level, but more people 
          likely thought about it the other way.) This means that in the vast 
          majority of cases, there is at least a small chance that a person will 
          be able to connect a spell with an NPC, even if they are out of that 
          NPC's traditional level range. <br>
          <br>
          - Overall, against NPCs that have medium-to-high resistances of a 
          given type, expect to see more full hits, fewer partials, but more 
          full resists in the new system. Taken over time, the damage done by PC 
          casters to semi-high resistance NPCs should be approximately the same, 
          but will definitely improve when the proper debuffs are applied (we 
          wanted to make sure that this did not turn into a universal nerf of 
          casters). <br>
          <br>
          We look forward to seeing how these changes play out in front of a 
          larger audience. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>** Line of Sight Changes ** <br>
          <br>
          - For spells that require Line of Sight (LoS), the LoS check is now at 
          the beginning of the spellcast, not the end. <br>
          - Spells that require but do not have of LoS will now fail 
          immediately. <br>
          - Harmful spells require LoS. <br>
          - Most Beneficial spells still do not require LoS. <br>
          - Bind Sight type spells do not require LoS. <br>
          - Any beneficial spell containing a Cancel Magic component requires 
          LoS. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>** Pets ** <br>
          - Pet-only buffs now automatically attempt to target your pet if you 
          cast them with the wrong target or no target at all. <br>
          - The limit on the amount of haste that can be applied to a pet has 
          been changed (aka. The Pet Haste Cap). The amount of haste that can be 
          placed on a pet now scales with the level of its owner. The scaling 
          occurs in a way that is consistent with how much haste a given caster 
          can place on his own pet (using a Level 56 Magician as an example: The 
          idea is that both Burnout IV and Muzzle of Mardu should be useful).
          <br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>** User Interface ** <br>
          <br>
          - Deleting Spells from Spellbook: Storebought spells can be deleted 
          from your spellbook. To delete a spell just right-click it to 
          highlight it and tap the DELETE key. Please note: This does not 
          convert the spell back into a scroll. You will have to buy a new 
          scroll if you wish to re-scribe the spell. No reimbursements will be 
          made for deleted spells. <br>
          - Item Links: When you inspect an item with Alt-Left-Click, the item 
          inspect window stays up. To paste a &quot;link&quot; to the item you're looking 
          at into your chat bar, click on the item's graphic. That will &quot;speak&quot; 
          a link that others can click on to see the stats of the item, as if 
          they were inspecting it themselves. <br>
          - Updated the /note window. The old /note &lt;text&gt; command still works 
          as it always has. But you can now use /note without additional text to 
          produce a text window for entering note text. The /note command window 
          should not break existing skins. <br>
          - Fixed a bug with the tracking window that was showing the sorting 
          set for something other than normal for non-rangers (this was just a 
          visual bug). <br>
          - Fixed a bug that sometimes caused a crash when zoning with the 
          corpse window open. <br>
          - Added UI Label type #74 = Player Title <br>
          - &quot;Reply to&quot; will properly prepend a ;tell in front of names that are 
          from other servers. <br>
          - Extended the &quot;reply to&quot; queue to 50 names. <br>
          - Fixed some aesthetics with labels. Percentages will never show above 
          100 now (even during a heal). Corpse HP will always show 0. <br>
          - There will now be sound when banking coins. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On top of all the above, I have had reports of the snare component of 
        our Epic Weapon has also been removed.</p>
        <p>No reports of the new healing spell yet, hopefully next patch.</p>
        <p>The above is just the parts of the patch message that seemed to speak 
        to druids :)&nbsp; For more, patch and you will see the entire message.</p>
