About 400 mana and about 2 minutes per HG.<BR><BR>As soon as one dies I do another, and sometimes I'll do two at a time. Basically, it takes me (when you include medding etc.) 2-3 minutes to kill an HG..I'll be generous and say it takes 3 which is on the high end. <BR><BR>That means 20 HGs an hour. When you include FS weapons, you're looking at about 30 pp per HG.<BR><BR>OK You're right, its only about 2400 plat, but its close. In 5 hours you could pretty much do it. <BR><BR>Of course if its camped, then theres a problem. <BR>Saven MistWolf<BR>Druid of the 56th Season<BR>Wild Knights, The Rathe<BR><BR> <BR>rtfm<BR>Registered User<BR>(6/8/01 7:02:13 pm)<BR>Reply | Edit  Re: Two things that massively improved my soloing...<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> I have had 2 friends invite me to go and kill HGs, recently.<BR><BR>I literally laughed at them.<BR><BR>Think im going to take them up on in now.<BR><BR>Thanks for the encouragement.<IMG SRC="/boards/images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><BR><BR>Doh;<BR><BR><BR>Edited by: rtfm at: 6/8/01 7:03:16 pm<BR> <BR>Aelwr<BR>Registered User<BR>(6/9/01 3:40:11 am)<BR>Reply  Re: Two things that massively improved my soloing...<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> I did a few Ice giants while I was spending my 6 hours foraging for my epic in Everfrost.

Couple other things you might find Useful. One is what I call the No Look Curve Dish. This applies to when you are Quad Kiting. I also have what’s called the No Look While Looking Target Acquisition. <BR><BR>The No Look Curve Dish is when you have ensnared a group of MOBs to quad kite, or what every number to kite. You run, pivot left or right, than stop, rotate either left or right and cast while pivoting/rotating. As long as you are set in a fixed point, rotation is not registered to the Sever as actual Movement. You can pivot with zero interrupts.<BR><BR>No Look While Looking Target Acquisition is a little more Tricky. Target a MOB, have that MOB in your target area highlighted, check the area for your 2nd MOB. Once you see your 2nd MOB Ensnare your 1st Target, you don’t have to be looking at the MOB to ensnare him. Once you cast Ensnare hit the Ecs Key and grab the next MOB. Why the Esc Key, because in some zones, like the Move Stop Server Translation, it can be slow.<BR><BR>I have to do this in Cobal Scar because of the Soupy Lag Factor. The Hide and Med is an old experienced Druids trick that sure needed to be brought back to people’s attention. Trying to see if you are hiding using F9 is bugged. Having any Target selected then checking for Indifference (CON) is the ultimate way to know you are in fact Hiding. I do this while I fish, especially if I’m in a hot zone with wondering MOBs. In case you didn’t know you can Fish and Forage while Hiding. <BR><BR>You can alos Fish while Hiding/Meding. The movement to Server Ratio also applies to when you begin moving. You might have discovered that once you have cast a spell like SOW for all those impatient types, you can cast and as your Cast Indicator is nearing the end of its Cycle you can actually start moving before the Indicator Cycle is completed. I would suggest you experiment with this to see how soon you can move and get the spell off.<BR><BR><BR>BuzzSivlerThor (55 Preserver)<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR> <BR>rtfm<BR>Registered User<BR>(6/9/01 10:00:48 am)<BR>Reply | Edit  Re: Two things that massively improved my soloing...<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> Added benefit of the 'twist'...<BR><BR>If they do get into melee, they will do far less damage, and you obviously lessen your chances or taking a backstab(Provens;).<BR><BR>That one trick should be learned at 14th level kiting. I learned it much later than that, and regret not knowing it sooner.<BR><BR>Simple little trick, does not seem like much, but it's like snare, a simple level 1 spell that you should use your entire career.<BR><BR><BR> <BR>Stormwolf9  <BR>Registered User<BR>(6/10/01 6:58:46 am)<BR>Reply <BR>  Re: Two things that massively improved my soloing...<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> umm... how do you 'twist'? <BR>Lauralyn <BR>Druidess of the 15th Circle - Tribunal<BR> <BR>Fubbor  <BR>Registered User<BR>(6/10/01 8:23:16 am)<BR>Reply  Re: Two things that massively improved my soloing...<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> the only way to kite is as follows.--<BR>Snare=50mana? never looked<BR>Root=175 mana i use level 56 root fast cast time<BR>Epic dot= 1600 damage no mana<BR>Wing death=1200 damage 250 mana<BR>ES armd dot= 300 damage no mana<BR>MED for a few tell wing death wares off<BR>Recast wing death=1200 damage 250 mana<BR>Recast ES arms=300 damage no mana<BR>med for few <BR>Recast wing death=1200 damage 250 mana<BR>Recast ES arms=300 damage no mana<BR><BR>OK that adds up to about 6000 damage in 3 minutes for about<BR>1000 mana you can kill any melee that dont summon and just about any caster that dont summon in the game. If you dont mind takeing a bit longer you dont even need to cast wingdeath. <BR><BR>I got my epic at level 56 i could get almost 2 blue bubs an hour in KC. Because you can kill up to 6 or more mobs at the same time I would often solo the right court yard that is very good room to root kite in if you dont get trained. Well once i hit 58 most stuff in kc is green now so I solo alot in Seb good place to solo there is gate out or down by necro jail.<BR><BR>Dont know if this helps anyone but jut leting ya know. <BR>Fubbor Aggain 55 Dr00d of E'CI "If I go crazy will you still call me Superman"<BR> <BR>Wannawin  <BR>Registered User<BR>(6/10/01 10:08:46 am)<BR>Reply <BR>  Re: Two things that massively improved my soloing...<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> isn't winged death 350 mana? <IMG SRC="/boards/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <BR>Wannawin Litlewolf, an animal loving druid <BR>Walaf Weaponmaster, the mighty short pirate <BR>"HAR HAR, Shiver me timbers!" <BR> <BR>rtfm<BR>Registered User<BR>(6/10/01 11:51:06 am)<BR>Reply | Edit  Re: Two things that massively improved my soloing...<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> umm... how do you 'twist'?<BR><BR>You will notice that when you are kiting that when you stop to cast and unless you stand still for 3 seconds you will get an spell interrupt.<BR><BR>So what a lot of us did/do, was obviously count out for 3 seconds after stopping before starting to cast. (3 Count).<BR><BR>But, if you turn immediately after stopping, for turning never interrupts a spell, you could cast immediately.<BR><BR>Some players will do a quick, sit and stand, does the same thing, but more inconvenient for me at least...<BR><BR>Now, I never got it to work with mouselook(twist), but if you turn immediately after stopping with you keyboard button, you can even cast the spell while you are turning.<BR><BR>Until the server gets the input update, that you are turning or doing something other than running, it will think that you are still running forward for those 3 seconds. You have seen that already im sure with ghost players running in place into walls, or going off in a wierd direction which they are not really going in. It is the same thing causing it.<BR><BR>Other wierd things will interrupt your casting but that's a whole 'nother topic. <BR> <BR>Stormwolf9  <BR>Registered User<BR>(6/10/01 6:19:32 pm)<BR>Reply <BR>  Re: Two things that massively improved my soloing...<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> I don't know if i'm happy because I already do that, or disappointed because I won't get any improvement in my play style.

I ask a question a week or so about the problem of interupts when casting a spell and was give so good advice. Since then I have do it and no more interupts. What I do is I run backward when I kite, guess that is how it got its name, I then stop and hit the right arrow key so I turn just a smiggen then cast and BOOM mob hit for 180 no melee damage. Then I take off running again hoping I dont run into the river.

If i hadn't a checked hide for effectiveness, any old mob, from a green to a red could a got a free crack at me as I try to recover mana in-fight.<BR><BR>Using this method I solod'd with impunity in the flat areas of LOIO all throughout my level 29, only picking up skellies every now and then.<BR><BR>It was quite a difference from when I would trust hide to work everytime, and would try to rot and pick up a second mob that i had to now deal with.<BR><BR>I literaly was able to Rot mobs, looking at my book, blind as a bat, as I hear footsteps criss crossing over me.<BR><BR><BR><BR>Lionfist Sarnaksbane<BR>Ashen Monk of the 31st Dragon<BR><BR>Irontree Ravenstrike <BR>Earthpriest of the 30th Solstice<BR><BR>Proud Members, Light of Harmony (7th Hammer)<BR><BR>"This above all things in Norrath: Honor"<BR><BR> <BR>Tar Markvar  <BR>Registered User<BR>(6/13/01 1:33:06 pm)<BR>Reply  Something Interesting I noticed Here<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> I just noticed that a lot of the replies here are as follows: <BR><BR>"One thing that helped me solo was this thing I got when I got to be level 57."<BR><BR>It's like saying, "I found poker to be a lot easier when I had a Strait Flush."<BR><BR>Not a flame, just an observation. <IMG SRC="/boards/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><BR><BR>Tar  <BR></FONT><BR></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR="#f7f5e6"><TD nowrap align="left">&nbsp;</TD><TD><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp<a href="/boards/bb_profile.php?mode=view&user=221"><img src="/boards/images/profile.gif" border=0 alt="View Profile of Flaim"></a>
