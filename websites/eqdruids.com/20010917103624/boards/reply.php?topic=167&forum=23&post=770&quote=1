Reply  Levelling quickly from 16 to 24
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hi all,

Thought I might tip you on my knowledge of fast levelling those levels. Now as I did this a few months ago the camps might be crowded now. They werent then.

1) Head to Lake Rathe (south of South K). Once there, head to the far South-west corner. There's some kind of water corridor leading to a small piece of grass with a hut, and a guy named Jonah. He'll aggro you on sight. Just kick his butt fast and camp him for 2-3 levels. He's on 5 minutes spawn time, drops crappy loot (waterskins most of the time), but yields TREMENDOUS xp at these levels. You can practically kill him as soon as he spawns, as you have enough time to med before he spawns again. Dont forget to spikebomb yourself for the melee.

2) On hitting 20 (or 19 if high wis), you may consider Aviak guards. Now there are some camps scattered around this zone, but the best spot I found were two aviaks in a hut very near Jonah. Leaving Jonah, you head west and north (in water), and the hut is the first one on your left. Since there are two aviaks, you need to break the spawns. You do that by harmoing them (just climb on the side cliff to get in range), then kick'em. This camp was so safe I stayed in treeform the whole time (HP regen easyer) and just killed one after the other with NOONE bothering me and absolutely no risk.

3) The hermit in South K. This i hear is a highly camped spot nowadays. You should consider kicking his butt around 24. Yields very good xp and very good loot (FS weapons on an uncommon basis).

Now I am a halfling, so xp is rumored easyer for us. But doing this (especially Jonah and the aviaks) I was making one orange bubble XP every 35 minutes. From 16 to 24. Cheers 8^)

PS: As a general rule, at those levels, when meleing was still possible, I would remain in treeform for hp regen and spikebomb myself (Shield of **, **armor). And never worry about healing myself.

 I just want to say that I am back from a 6 month hiatis. I am a level 18 WE Druid. Last night in HH Pass I made 3 bubbles in three hours with a group against the orcs. I made around 15 plat. Somebody tell me how to beat that!

 I just wanted to agree about fighting in Highpass. I jumped from lvl 14 to lvl 17 in under 2 days, moderate playing. 17-19 there was a little slower, but the PP was great. total i probably made 300-400PP from 14-19. at 19 i tried Highhold, but got bored so went to fight aviaks in SK. been there ever since, i am 21 now.

 To keep that momentum going from 25 to 30 head to Cazic Thule. Bad train city, but once you are in the right group in the Throne room, Gators or 4C, exp is mad. Bub an or less in TR, non stop mayhem. Gonne solo till 33 then I will hit solb, more crazy exp.

Good luck

 At lvl 22 I headed for Everfrost and killed Wolly Mammoths. Started kiting Friday night at about 1am no one was there. I leveled in about 4-5 hours there and the tusks that drop sell for 7-8pp each. Nice pp and really nice XP. I did this really until lvl 29 with just leaving a few times. Sure after lvl 25-26 you can get better XP somewhere else but the Tusks were just nice to sell at that level.
