<br>
Hibbs Rootenpaw says 'Hello! I am Hibbs Rootenpaw, Master Druid of the Storm 
Reapers. If you have not yet ventured beyond Rivervale beware of the [dangers] 
that lurk through out the lands beyond our shire. There are many evil beings 
that would not hesitate to end the life of a young druid of the Storm Reapers. '
<br>
<br>
You say, 'What Dangers' <br>
<br>
Hibbs Rootenpaw says 'The Teir'Dal, or Dark Elves, to the east have slain a 
number of brave Storm Reapers that are attempting to cleanse the Nektulos Forest 
of the corruption caused by the Teir'Dals evil magics. To the west, the human 
farmers in the Plains of Karana are beset upon by vicious tribes of Gnolls and 
must valiantly defend their farms. Closer to home the Death Fist Orcs and Goblin 
Clans Runnyeye and Pick Claws all attempt to control the Misty Thicket and chop 
down its sturdy trees for lumber. If you are planning on leaving the safety of 
Rivervale I advise you to deliver this note to Bartle Barnick. He will help you 
get yourself outfitted for survival in the wilds. When he has outfitted you in a 
suit of protective leather return here for [further instruction]. ' <br>
<br>
You say, 'Further instructions.' <br>
<br>
<br>
Hibbs Rootenpaw says 'If you feel you are ready for the responsibility of an 
important task then you may assist with the [investigation] of the ancient 
cursed fields in the Misty Thicket. The crumbling walls that surround the cursed 
fields are believed to have been constructed around the same time as the ruined 
tower and the great wall of Cetelt. We Storm Reapers believe that the walls once 
surrounded beautiful and fruitful gardens. The arrogance of the caretaker of the 
gardens offended the Gods and in turn the gardens were cursed with disease and 
an evil power that animates the corpses of the dead. The Scarecrow, Old 
Gourdhead, stands in one of these two fields and warns passers by that it is an 
accursed place. Recently someone has been placing rats in the fields to become 
diseased. ' <br>
<br>
*Hand note to Bartle Barnick* <br>
<br>
Bartle Barnick says 'It is good to see another of our young people choose the 
humble life of a druid of Karana. I have assembled that will allow you to 
construct some protective leather garments to keep you comfortable in the wilds 
and help turn aside the weapons of the Storm Reapers enemies. The required 
components for the leather vary according to which piece of Moss Toe Leather you 
are planning on crafting. Do you wish to craft a [moss toe cap], a [moss toe 
bracer], [moss toe gloves], [moss toe boots], [moss toe sleeves], [moss toe 
leggings], or a [moss toe tunic]. ' <br>
<br>
You say, 'Moss Toe Boots' <br>
<br>
Bartle Barnick says 'To assemble Moss toe Boots you will require two [silk 
thread], two ruined mossy rat pelts, and two giant wood spider hairs. Once you 
have the necessary components combine them in your Mail Assembly Kit with this 
Tattered Boot Pattern. '</font></p>

Bartle Barnick says 'It is good to see another of our young people choose the 
humble life of a druid of Karana. I have assembled that will allow you to 
construct some protective leather garments to keep you comfortable in the wilds 
and help turn aside the weapons of the Storm Reapers enemies. The required 
components for the leather vary according to which piece of Moss Toe Leather you 
are planning on crafting. Do you wish to craft a [moss toe cap], a [moss toe 
bracer], [moss toe gloves], [moss toe boots], [moss toe sleeves], [moss toe 
leggings], or a [moss toe tunic]. ' <br>

You say, 'Moss Toe Sleeves' <br>

Bartle Barnick says 'To assemble Moss toe Sleeves you will require two [silk

necessary components combine them in your Mail Assembly Kit with this Tattered 
Sleeves Pattern. ' </font><br>

Hibbs Rootenpaw says 'Excelent work young Storm Reaper. It is sad that one of 
our own would resort to such vile acts; his mind must have been twisted by evil 
desires. Such behavior is practically unheard of among the kind people of 
Rivervale. Take this dull scimitar and sharpen it in the forge here at the 
Tagglefoots Farm with a sharpening stone. It may take several attempts if you 
are unfamiliar with the process. Once that is done give the sharpened scimitar 
and a large fruit bat wing to Bodbin Gimple and he will put the finishing 
touches on what will be a fitting scimitar for a Druid of the Storm Reapers.’

Gimble near the forge on the farm) <br>
<br>
Bodbin Gimble fashions a grip out of the large fruit bat wing then tests and 
polishes the blade of the scimitar. ‘Yer another one of Hibbs trainees I 
suppose. This here’s a fine weapon for a young Druid of the Storm Reapers like 
yerself.’ <br>
