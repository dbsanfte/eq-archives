To make the short of it, it is a fairly easy process and i have found it to be safe too.

Print up a map of Kael, go invis, and head for the WL zone line.  If you feel uncomfortable doing this ya might ask around when you first zone into kael if anyone will help you as with sow it will take you two minutes or less to get there.  The area of Kael that you are going through is good for invis as no giants along the route see invis.

After you zone into WL, you might want to bind yourself right there just in case.  If you have been killing giants, Keep invis up as their are giants at the front of this entrance that will aggro immediately.  I will have sow, levi, and sup camo up and zoom off to the west northwest  if i remember the coords right (and i have helped about 10 guildmembers in the last week) they should be about pos 1500 pos 4500.

Zone into SS and make your way to the front gate and con the guards while visible.  If you are dubious you can get around without being attacked.  you will need to sneak up to the merchants to talk to them or so.

I would suggest printing up a map to SS, and getting to the dragon fountain is a fairly simple process but you need a key.  You have 3 methods of getting a key.  Find the keyholder, Ziglark Whisperwing (30 min spawn) and talk to him and do the quest.  Kill him on the spot and loot him (made me shoot on sight with the inhabitants of SS and to the wyverns and drakes in CS, fortunately they do not see invis along the route to the dragon fountain.  You will lose invis when you open the first gate but I dont think you will lose it opening the second gate, but dont qoute me on that one....i have corrected this back to dubious by a short stint in Kael).  Or if someone else is already hunting in that area you could always ask to loot the body and the key is no drop.

Using the map, find your way to dragon fountain room, jump across the devotion pool, and stand next to the statue.  Hold the key with your cursor and left click on the statue.   Wallah

You are now in Cobalt scar, and if you have good faction in SS, you will have the same here and no matter how many unnamed wyverns and cobalt drakes you kill, you cannot hurt your faction....cool huh?  Do not hunt the named wyvern and cobalt drake here unless you want a faction hit.  Run on over to the dragon ring (pretty much straight east) and pick up your key.  I would again print up a map here it is good hunting even though i am lvl 52, I can easily solo wyverns and drakes(definately use snare root dot on the drakes and move back while you wait).  Bulthars i would use a group (think of a ulthark man of war doubled) they have a large aggro range and the herdmaster is mr to me at my level  you cannot sow him or root him but you can dot him .  A group of 4 (two melees, cleric and me) took him down after a lengthy fight)
there are other mobs but you can read about it.......have fun!
