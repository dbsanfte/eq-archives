                <p align="left">
                <font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 9pt">A lot of people have 
                noticed what appears to be random video lag since the DirectX 9 
                engine went live several months ago. Many players, even with 
                very high end systems, are forced to log out and back in or even 
                restart in some cases due to video lag that makes the game 
                unplayable for them. Many others have been unable to &quot;Dual Box&quot; 
                since that patch for the same reasons.<br>
                <br>
                The problem that's causing this is a simple memory leak that 
                Sony either can't find or doesn't care about. This is why most 
                people notice the problem after they've zoned a few times. The 
                better your<br>
                system, the longer you can go without noticing it, but 
                eventually it hits everyone at some point.<br>
                <br>
                Thankfully, there's a very simple workaround for this. Simply 
                hold down ALT and hit ENTER at the same time. This is the toggle 
                between windowed and full screen modes. It forces the game to 
                re-allocate resources and re-draw the world and UI due to the 
                screen changing sizes. You can do it twice to maintain whichever 
                way you normally play, but this method will get rid of that 
                &quot;random&quot; video lag that's been happening with the new engine.<br>
                <br>
                Many people in my guild have used this simple workaround to 
                great effect, and are able to play in<br>
                zones where they could not before, and are enjoying EverQuest 
                again. If the lag is bugging you, give this a try. Heck, I don't 
                even lag in PoK anymore after using this. </font></p>

                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 9pt">A 
                recent patch added new commands to allow others to drag your 
                corpse, but they didn't make it into the patch release notes.<br>
                /consent group - flags your current corpse(s) so they can be 
                dragged by all current group members.<br>
                /consent raid - flags your current corpse(s) so they can be 
                dragged by any members of your current raid (including people 
                who join the raid later).<br>
                /consent guild - flags your current corpse(s) so they can be 
                dragged by anyone in your guild.<br>
                /deny group - removes the flag<br>
                /deny raid - removes the flag<br>
                /deny guild - removes the flag<br>
                --- <br>
                When you need to drag someone's corpse, rather than use a hotkey 
                that has &quot;/corpse&quot; in it, there is a &quot;/corpsedrag&quot; command that 
                you can use to make things easier for you.. If you target the 
                corpse you&nbsp;need to drag and type &quot;/corpsedrag&quot;, it acts as an 
                autofollow for the corpse! The corpse will follow you wherever 
                you need to go!<br>
                <br>
                When you get to where you wanna drag it to, just use the &quot;/corpsedrop&quot; 
                command to release it :)<br>
                <br>
                Now, I'm not sure if you could attach multiple corpses to you or 
                not, as I've only had to drag 1 corpse since I found this 
                command. But it could be handy if you could drag more than one 
                corpse&nbsp;at a time.</font></p>

                never have been convinced that someday, I would forgive the 
                medling tinker. After all was said and done, I gave him the 
                finger and here's how it happened. When he showed up with the 
                Thumpernack Isotope Multiplicitous Existance Machine, I was 
                proud to see my gear collection put to good use. After 45 of my 
                Orc Pawns and my 16 wombats,we finally had success. The T.I.M.E. 
                Machine spit out a perfectly sound wombat (minus an index claw) 
                who had actually been to tomorrow. Well, what self-respecting

              Notes</b><br>
              <br>
              Before I post your updated list I would like to give you a little 
              bit of information on the notes I have made on each item. <br>
              <br>
              Currently being evaluated – This means that a few of the 
              development team members are looking into ways to implement the 
              item. This does not guarantee that the item will be implemented; 
              however we may see changes made in the future. The Community Team 
              plans to give updates on these types of items every 2 weeks, even 
              if it’s just a “no change since the last update” <br>
              <br>
              Currently being discussed – This is almost just like being 
              evaluated however these items the development team is totally 
              undecided if they want to implement or how to do so. The Community 
              Team plans to give updates on these types of items every 2 weeks, 
              even if it’s just a “no change since the last update” <br>
              <br>
              Done – This means that the development team has implemented this 
              item and it’s currently on live servers. <br>
              <br>
              Currently on Test server – This means that the development team 
              has implement this item and it’s currently on test server, watch 
              for future updates for implementation on the live servers. <br>
              <br>
              Waiting for community feedback – This means we don’t have enough 
              information to make any type of decision on how to implement. 
              Threads will be started by me to get your feedback. <br>
              <br>
              No changes planned at this time – This means that the development 
              team has decided at this time not to implement this item. <br>
              <br>
              Items that are marked done will be removed from the top 10 issues 
              lists and you as a class will be able to replace those with new 
              issues. Watch for posts on this in the next week, your class 
              correspondents will be helping SOE update your top 10 issues lists 
              with these new items. If your top issues list was less then 10 
              issues to begin with you will be able to add more issues. <br>
              <br>
              You as a class will have the option to replace items that are 
              marked as “no changes planned at this time” with new items or 
              leave them on the list. Please understand that leaving them on the 
              list does not mean that they will eventually be implemented 
              however it does mean that the class as a whole still feels that 
              these are valid issues and would like implementation eventually. 
              One thing to note, we will not be responding to requests as to why 
              something is classified the way it is. <br>
              <br>

                Gates of Discord <br>
                ------------------- <br>
                - Zone experience modifiers were increased in all zones from Tipt/Vxed 
                and beyond. <br>
                - Natimbi, Qinimi, Barindu, Riwwi, and Ferubi should be tuned 
                more appropriately for their intended level ranges. <br>
                - NPCs will no longer hit for max damage as often. Knights in 
                particular should find it easier to tank the NPCs they previously 
                had difficulty with. <br>
                - Ikkinz -- Guilds no longer have to flag every member in order 
                to complete the Ikkinz trials. Only one person needs to complete 
                all events/raids to start the seventh Ikkinz trial. At that point, 
                all players who complete the seventh trial will get full credit 
                for the zone. <br>
                - NPC innates have been adjusted to behave a little more reasonably. 
                <br>
                - Zone travel has been made easier. Animal aggression was lowered 
                by changing their faction and See Invis percentages were reduced 
                on several NPCs. <br>
                - Spell drops have been increased. <br>
                - Increased the rate of cash drops. <br>
                - The mini bosses in Qvic now have a more appropriate respawn 
                rate. Their item drop rate has been increased to compensate for 
                this. <br>
                - Breakdown in Communication quest now has improved rewards! </p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory">Collision <br>
                ------------------- <br>
                More improvements to the collision system should make it a lot 
                more difficult to get stuck. </p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory">Misc. <br>
                ------------------- <br>
                The Eye of Zomm will once again open closed doors.</p>

              <p align="left" class="newsstory"><em>I<span class="newsstory">t 
                seems that some folks are concerned about an email that they are 
                receiving from IGN offering them a free Classic EverQuest account. 
                There is some concern that this is a scam. <br>
                It isn't.<br>
                IGN has indeed been authorized to give away these accounts. If 
                they give you one, take it! </span></em></p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory"><em>Keep in mind that in order 
                for someone to 'scam' you they'll need to acquire information 
                from you that they can use. If someone asks you for a password 
                on your existing EverQuest account, don't give it to them. IGN 
                isn't asking for such information, they're just giving out accounts.</em></p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory"><em>I appreciate that folks are

                - We have added a new adventure zone which should be a challenge 
                for 2 groups of about 50th level. <br>
                A party of adventurers is missing and was last seen working with 
                the undead. Will you brave the catacombs to find them? </p>

                elvish city of Takish Hiz! Now you must find what was left beneath 
                the sands. Good luck. </p>

                Try out the new Hot Spot zones which give a boost to Experience

                aimed at characters level 20 to 51. The Hot Spot zones will shift 
                from time to time, so watch for messages giving clues as to where 
                the new ones may be. </p>

                Gates Sewers and Vxed <br>
                ----------------------- <br>
                - Rare NPCs in the Gates sewers and Vxed will not spawn at the 
                creation of the expedition zone. They will now spawn after the 
                zone has been occupied for some time. </p>

                Monks and Beastlords will be able to swap the robe in for a leather 
                looking BP with the same stats by visiting Garath the Trader in 
                East Wastes. You will be able to swap the items back and forth 
                with Garath for your desired look. (Lungi? Lungi? What is a Lungi?) 
              </p>

                with 1000's upon 1000's of emails, and It would just take to long
