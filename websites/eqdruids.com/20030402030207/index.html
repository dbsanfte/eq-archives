        <br>
        - <b>Added the ability for any caster to research dropped priest spells 
        using the research books found in Gunthak. The research notes for these

        priest spells. </b><br>

        quest. <br>

        and received Pure Blood will be able to obtain the Blood of Nadox scroll 
        simply by hailing the quest NPC. </b><br>
        - Increased the drop rate significantly on the quest items for the 
        ShadowKnight and Necromancer Legacy of Ykesha spells. <br>

        spell <br>
        - Changed Strength of the Diaku to a single target strength and 
        dexterity buff. <br>
        - Changed Talisman of the Diaku to a group strength and dexterity buff.
        <br>
        - Replaced the shaman spell Aim of the Ginda with Talisman of Alacrity, 
        which is a group haste spell. <br>
        - Replaced the shaman spell Talisman of the Gindan with Tiny Terror, 
        which is a group shrink spell. <br>
        - The Darkness line of spells should now have their sounds back. <br>
        - Winged Death now has its particle effects back. <br>
        - Song of the Deep Seas now says: &quot;The fury of the deep sea fills your 
        arms&quot; when sung (changed &quot;see&quot; to &quot;sea&quot;). <br>
        - Changed the spelling of Malise to Malaise. <br>
        - Boneshear spell messages changed to make more sense. <br>
        - Iceflame of E`Ci now gives a message when it wears off. <br>
        <br>
        ** Items ** <br>
        <br>

        - Frogloks can no longer use Scaled Hierophant armor, Scaled Mystic 
        armor and Spiritstone of Cabilis. <br>
        - Corrected an issue with foldable medicine bags and foldable bearskin 
        potion bags. Items should now combine properly. <br>
        - Clockwork Observer legs and boots should now recharge. <br>
        - Class 3 Wood Point Arrows now have a range of 5 instead of 0. <br>
        - Changed Blessed Scout Arrows, Blessed Warrior Arrows, Mithril Scout 
        Arrows, Mithril Warrior Arrows, Mithril Champion Arrows and Blessed

        <br>
        ** Quests ** <br>
        <br>
        -<b> Performed surgery on Ragefire to remove his extraneous heart. </b>

        - Omat Vastsea will now summon Jhassad Oceanson if hailed by a character 
        in possession of the Orb of Vapor. He will summon the Avatar of Water if 
        the character has the Orb of the Triumvirate. But he will not summon 
        either if one of them is already around. <br>

        <br>
        - Added a command to allow you to toggle your target between your two 
        last targets (unlike Tab which toggles between your character and your 
        last target). To set the key that activates this feature, just open your 
        options window and select the Keyboard Tab. If you select all 
        categories, the entry will be the last one on the list, called Toggle 
        last two targets. This was actually added with our last patch. <br>
        <br>
        ** NPCs ** <br>
        <br>
        - Undead will begin to spawn again at night in Kithicor. <br>
        - Shin Master Grubbus in Gukta will now be more selective about who he 
        allows to do tasks for him, and he'll be speaking directly to folks 
        (using /tell). His chatty nature was raising the volume in Gukta to 
        levels that were considered unacceptable. He will also be a bit clearer 
        about what he wants. <br>
        - Shar Vahl guards will now defend their city against Loda Kai poachers.

        - Porra, one of the Enchanter spell vendors in Felwithe, will no longer 
        spawn inside of a wall. This was hurting her business. <br>
        - Hutyn L`Lozz will now appear in his place of business and be less 
        likely to leave to go sightseeing in Neriak. <br>
        - Cleet Miller Jr. will now emote &quot;Grumbles and looks up at you&quot; instead 
        of saying it. <br>
        - The Goblins in Solusek's Eye are no longer wearing cloth armor. <br>
        - Junth McMannus will now be properly affected by movement reducing 
        spells. <br>

        - Corrected some text errors for Jortreva and Grendish the Crusaders as 
        well as Sage Xelrin, Sulgar, Warlord Gligoth, Bryce McFadden, Serna 
        Tasknon, Welno Tanlonikan, Lorekeeper_Einar and Master of Elements. <br>
        - These NPCs will now be asking for the correct items for their quests: 
        Gazoon Noihzog, Liteema Agner and Bolli Hillfoot. <br>
        - Kodiaks in the Rathe Mountains should be friendlier to Druids and 
        Rangers. <br>
        - Undead Frogloks and Skeletons in Sebilis no longer have an extreme 
        dislike for each other. <br>
        - Groflah Steadirt's corpse will no longer disappear when he is killed. 
        However, he is also no longer a merchant. <br>
        - Moved the Planar Projection for Rallos Zek so it can't be interfered 
        with by the zone exit. <br>
        - Corrected the spawn times for the Minotaur Hero. <br>
        - Half elven female bandits will now give experience, leave corpses and 
        be aided by other bandits. <br>
        - A Coerced Iiksar will now be known as A Coerced Iksar. <br>
        - Merchant Nora in Felwithe will once again sell her jewelry supplies.
        <br>

        <br>
        - Jusean will now give the proper quest reward when given the proper 
        item(s). <br>
        - Plaguebone Thieves no longer flee. <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        - Added new sounds to Shadowhaven. <br>
        - <b>Removed safe spots in Katta, Solusek's Eye, High Keep, Echo

        - Removed a box out in the middle of Skyfire that turned when clicked 
        but had no real purpose. <br>
        - Fixed a place in Burning Woods and the Plane of Knowledge where NPCs 
        would get stuck while wandering around. <br>
        - Also fixed a place in Erud's Crossing where sharks were getting stuck.
        <br>
        - The Veeshan's Peak zone in from Skyfire can no longer be triggered 
        from above. <br>

        on the second floor of the building. <br>
        - The teleporter from the Great Divide to the Plane of Knowledge will 
        now work during Coldain Ring War. <br>
        - The exit from the Plane of Justice to the Plane of Tranquility has 
        been moved to place characters next to the Plane of Justice entrance.
        <br>

        <span style="font-family:Arial">The work of Wizards and Druids has run 
        in tandem for some time.&nbsp; While it is true that Druidism relies upon a 
        closer association with Nature than does Wizardry, the types of work 
        have long been similar in practice.</span></p>

        <span style="font-family: Arial">While working closely with some of the 
        great Wizard masters as they compiled their advanced teachings, I 
        discovered that by using common elements of the world around us, the 
        capability to research some of these advanced Druid spells does exist!&nbsp; 
        It brings me great pleasure to be able to share this with my 
        contemporaries who follow this discipline, as their work is so closely 
        related to mine.&nbsp; Below are the results of my study. If should be 
        obvious that a Quill and Piece of Parchment are needed for each study.</span></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">From reading the above, it would seem 
        very possible that it will be wizards that will be able to do our 
        combines.&nbsp; Does this mean only wizards?&nbsp; We don't know yet.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">More will be incoming I'm sure.</font></p>
