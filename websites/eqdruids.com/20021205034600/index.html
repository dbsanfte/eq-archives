        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman">I've tried for about a week to come up with a good way to say 
            this, but since I couldn't I'll just say it. I don't plan on making 
            any more maps for this (or any) site in the future. There is 
            probably a 20-page explanation for why I've decided this, but I'll 
            give you all the brief version. This site has existed now for a 
            little over three-and-a-half years, and has been the work of just 
            myself. While it was very satisfying when I started, it has become 
            less so as time has gone on. I currently barely play EQ anymore for 
            fun, and it's very difficult to be enthusiastic about a fan site for 
            a game that you are no longer a fan for.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman">It would also be accurate to say that the money situation is not 
            really what I had hoped at this point. I had been hoping, at some 
            point, to make a book of the maps I have on this site in order to 
            make enough money to recupe what I had spent in terms of time in the 
            creation and support of the site. After SOE bent me over a barrel, 
            the major publishers felt there wasn't a large enough market for 
            another book, and I don't have the time to create one on my own, so 
            that idea is pretty much dead in the water. Any other potential for 
            making money would probably rely on making up new content for the 
            site that would be pay-for content, and I don't have the time to 
            easily create that kind of material, and it would probably have a 
            limited market and appeal if I did.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the end, though, running any site like this comes down to a 
            major time investment. I can keep up with updates alright, but the 
            creation of new material simply takes too long. I have a regular job 
            that demands 50+ hours a week if I do it right, and I really want to 
            do it right. Therefore, my commitment to this has to change.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman">That all being said, the site isn't going anywhere. It's still 
            going to exist as it does now, and I will keep it as up-to-date as 
            the information you guys send me and the little bit I find out on my 
            own. I may be trying to put up some of the parses I have as just 
            outlines, since that requires very little work on my part at this 
            point and would provide you all with at least some information to 
            use. Who knows, at some point in the future the situation might 
            change and I'll be willing to do more maps, however at this point I 
            wanted to let everyone know that that's not likely to be anytime 
            soon.</font></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal">This is why we are going to have to probably shut 
          off advertising sponsored boards. <br>
          <br>
          Each page view is paid for by us. It costs us real money to host these 
          sites. If you think $3600.00 a year is a lot to host this community, I 
          *BEG* you to go try and do it yourself. Your time and money 
          committment will be far greater than the $300 per month we're 
          charging.<br>
          <br>
          ezboard is probably going to move to GOLD only and ezSupporter only 
          boards... it is the only way we can survive and prosper. There is a 
          viscious cycle happening right now.. people use pop up stoppers which 
          leads to us putting more pop up ads, which leads to more people using 
          pop up stoppers.. <br>
          <br>
          We are at the point where we feel if a person isn't willing to support 
          their community at $1 per month, then that community needs to exist 
          elsewhere b/c frankly, we can't continue to provide service under 
          those conditions.<br>
          <br>
          I applaud Zadkiel for being smart and making a business arrangement to 
          keep this board gold. It is so easy for people to criticize when they 
          know nothing about the time committment and effort it takes to run a 
          community like this.<br>
          <br>
          Stop the hate and support each other - it makes life so much more fun 
          if you focus on the positive rather than the negative.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It all has to be paid somehow.&nbsp; Keep that in mind.</p>

        <p>We came up with a few tips and comments about using the Music Player. 
        Here are some hints that may help: <br>
        <br>
        - You can use wildcards when specifying files to load. For example, if 
        you click &quot;Add&quot;, browse down to C:\MyMusic, then type &quot;*.mp3&quot; in the 
        edit window portion of the File Selection Window, then click &quot;Ok&quot;, the 
        Music Player Window will attempt to add all files in the C:\MyMusic 
        directory that end in mp3. <br>
        <br>
        - When saving playlists, be sure to put the .M3U extension on the 
        filename or you won't be able to load it again. When loading files, the 
        Music Player looks at the extension to determine what kind of file it 
        is, and won't load files of types it doesn't recognize. <br>
        <br>
        - When first opening the File Selection Window, you may notice a delay 
        while the code determines which drives on your system are valid. <br>
        <br>
        - While songs continue to play during zoning, no song can begin during 
        zoning. The Music Player will continue with the next song when you zone 
        in. <br>
        <br>
        - When the Random button is depressed, the playlist is scrambled. 
        Un-pressing the Random button will revert the list back to its original 
        order for ease in finding certain listings. Pressing Random again will 
        re-scramble the list in a new &quot;random&quot; order.</td></tr>
