  <b><font face="Arial">Start out by handing your 6th shawl to Betti Frostweaver 
  in the Thurgadin Exchange. <br>
  <br>
  Betti Frostweaver says 'Spectacular artistry! I doubt I could have done better 
  myself. You'll have to forgive me, I know time is short and I tend to carry 
  on. This is the pattern for the making of a rune sacred to our people. It will 
  be our final test of your craftsmanship and will put many of your skills to 
  the test, but I trust you'll find the finished product to be more than worth 
  the effort. Show Gilthan the silk shawl, he will set you on the path. May 
  Brell always be with you outlander.<br>
  <br>
  Now show your shawl to Gilthan. <br>
  <br>
  Gilthan Brittleblade says 'So, you've been chosen to attempt the rune, eh? 
  Been ages since anyone's even made an attempt. </font></b><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <b><font face="Arial">The rune represents the very essence of our people, our 
  culture, and our religion. </font></b><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <b><font face="Arial">Take a sea shell runed with enduring breath and a small 
  brick of velium and grind them together in a mortar and pestle. </font></b><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">

  <b><font face="Arial">Add water to the powder and model the rune. Fire the 
  rune with water and the best of firing sheets. Show the product to Trademaster 
  Kroven.<br>
  <br>
  Head off to Siren's Grotto and kill Sirens for hours until you get a Runed Sea 
  Shell with 1 charge of Enduring Breath. <br>
  <br>
  Combine the Sea Shell and a small brick of velium in a Mortar and Pestle which 
  you can buy from a rogue vendor. <br>

  Trivial at Pottery 168 <br>
  <br>
  Now show the rune to Trademaster Kroven also in the Thurgadin Exchange. <br>
  <br>
  Trademaster Kroven says 'Fine piece of work there, Adorean, especially fer an 
  outlander. Now yer gunna need to make a burin to etch the rune with. Once 
  that's done ye need to kneel in the chapel and recite this prayer with total 
  sincerity in yer heart. If yer plea be heard by our Father Brell he'll bless 
  ya with the knowledge necessary to carry on. With that knowledge you'll take 
  the blank rune, the burin and a fletching kit to etch the rune. Show Grimthor 
  the etched rune and he'll guide you from there.<br>
  <br>
  He gives you a: Prayer to Brell: LORE NO DROP <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what burin' <br>
  <br>
  Trademaster Kroven says 'You'll need a fletching kit and a fair bit of skill 
  for this one. Round up a tooth from a swordfish and attach it to an Ulthork 
  tusk wrapped in a Molkor hide.<br>
  <br>
  Head to Siren's Grotto and get a swordfish tooth from the swordfish and a 
  molkor hide from the molkors. You can also get Ulthork tusks there but they're 
  much easier to get in eastern wastes where you can kill the low level Ulthorks 
  for their tusks. The swordfish tooth is NO DROP which is the only item 
  actually forcing you to go into Sirens Grotto.<br>
  <br>
  Combine the tusk, swordfish tooth, and hide in a fletching kit. <br>
  <br>
  Result: Burin: LORE NO DROP Trivial at Fletching 135 <br>
  <br>
  Go to the room where the quest started with the Grand Historian and wander 
  around spamming the following prayer until you see a message saying you've 
  been inspired.<br>
  <br>
  You say, 'Oh Brell, Thank you for protecting me and seeing me through my 
  trials. Forgive me for the things I think and say and do that displease you. 
  Please reveal to me your will and bless me with the patience and obedience to 
  do that which you desire. Amen.'<br>
  <br>
  You have been inspired. The sacred pattern of the Coldain rune materializes on 
  the ground before you. <br>
  <br>
  On the floor in front of the Historian was a Etched Rune pattern: LORE ITEM NO 
  DROP <br>
  <br>
  Combine the pattern, burin, and rune in a fletching kit. <br>
  <br>
  Result: Etched Rune: MAGIC LORE NO DROP <br>
  Trivial at Fletching 168<br>
  <br>
  Go show your Etched Rune to Grimthor by the brew barrel in Thurgadin. <br>
  <br>
  Grimthor Brewbeard says 'That looks about right. You're moving along well 
  outlander. Next you'll be needin to brew up a sacred ink to fill the grooves 
  in your rune. Take Iceclad Cutlass fish oil, liquid velium, and some Royal 
  Kromrif blood, brew them in the barrel here then take the product and the rune 
  and combine them in a fletching kit. Show Talem Tucker the resulting item if 
  yer successful.<br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what cutlass fish oil' <br>
  <br>
  Grimthor Brewbeard says 'Grab a pole and fish the waters in Iceclad until you 
  catch yourself three Iceclad Cutlass fish. Place them in this oil extractor 
  and you'll have whatcha need.<br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what liquid velium' <br>
  <br>
  Grimthor Brewbeard says 'Collect a small piece of velium and a bottle of 
  rubbing alcohol and brew them together in a barrel. It ain't easy, but it 
  should prove to be a minor task for the likes of you.<br>
  <br>

  <br>
  Fish in Iceclad Ocean until you get 3 Cutlass fish and combine them in the

  <br>
  Go to the jewelry store in Thurgadin by the Exchange. Show your rune to Talem 
  Tucter. <br>
  <br>
  Talem Tucter says 'I've heard of your mission, Adorean . I must admit that I 
  had my doubts you'd make it this far. The rune's creation is nearly impossible 
  for even the most skilled of Coldain craftsmen. You should be exceedingly 
  proud. Many have attempted this feat and nearly all have lacked the skill, 
  faith, patience and persistence that is prerequisite for what destiny holds in 
  store for you. You are now ready to use this pattern to construct the sacred 
  rune's casing and complete the runed shawl.<br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what casing' <br>
  <br>
  Talem Tucter says 'Combine two platinum bars, a small piece of velium and the 
  casing pattern in a Jeweler's kit. Take the completed casing and the rune and 
  combine them in the same kit. When this is done all that's left is to tailor 
  the rune to the shawl with the pattern. Take the finished product to Borannin, 
  I'm sure he's eager to speak with you.<br>
  <br>
  Combine the pattern he gives you, a small piece of velium and two platinum 
  bars in a jewelry kit. <br>
  <br>
  Result: The casing. Trivial at Jewel Craft 152 <br>
  <br>
  Combine the Casing and your Rune in a jewelry kit. <br>

  start and your 6th shawl and combine in a tailoring kit.<br>

  FIRE/COLD/POISON 7 Effect: Flowing Thought 1 Trivial at Tailoring 162<br>
  <br>
  You can then go show Loremaster Borannin your 7th shawl. <br>
  <br>
  Loremaster Borannin says 'Incredible! Never before has an outlander been 
  skilled and determined enough to craft our sacred rune. You are now worthy of 
  the Dain's most perilous tasks. One is being prepared for you as we speak, 
  please check back with me soon and I will outline the details for you. Until 
  then allow me to commend you on a job well done!</font></b><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
