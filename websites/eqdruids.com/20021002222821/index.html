      <tr><td height=18><font face="Arial">From EQCastersrealm:</font><font face="verdana" size="2"><p>
        There has been a lot of rumors going around recently after shipping date 
        changes were made by Amazon in the United Kingdom which pushed the 
        release date of the Planes of Power expansion back to December.&nbsp; Players 
        curious as to why the major online distributor had pushed the release 
        date back two months reportedly discovered that the shipment date for 
        European players had been altered to coincide with the new localized 
        service in Europe.</p>
        <p>Some time ago Ubisoft &amp; Sony Online Entertainment entered into an 
        agreement to provide localized EverQuest service to Europe.&nbsp; Known as 
        EverQuest Renaissance, this service would see European players receive 
        the ability to play EverQuest without language barriers opening the 
        French and German speaking communities up to the massively multiplayer 
        online role-playing game.</p>
        <p>It's been speculated for some time that once the service was put live 
        that new purchases of EverQuest distributed by Ubisoft in Europe would 
        not be able to connect to Sony operated servers in the United States as 
        the subscription fees for European sold EQ boxes are being used to fund 
        the Ubisoft servers and customer service systems in Europe.</p>
        <p>Recently it appeared that this system would also be applied to 
        existing players with the purchase of the Planes of Power expansion.&nbsp; 
        Namely, that existing players who purchased a European retail box for 
        Planes of Power would only be able to use the upgrade keys on European 
        servers.&nbsp; This was on top of the already existing concerns of a December 
        release.</p>
        <p>John Smedley, COO of Sony Online, made the following announcement:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><i>I wanted to clear up some misconceptions that are floating 
          around: </i></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><i>1) European and UK players will be able to get Planes of Power 
            on or around October 21st. We will be offering Planes of Power on a 
            Pre-Order basis to these customers and will attempt to keep the 
            shipping costs extremely reasonable to make sure they don't have to 
            pay a ton to get it sent over. </i></p>
            <p><i>2) We are still working out the exact date of the launch of 
            Planes of Power in the UK and Europe with our partners at UbiSoft. 
            The rumors swirling around now are just that. </i></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><i>We very much value our European and UK customers. We're simply 
          coordinating all of this with the launch of the new localized service 
          with UbiSoft. </i></p>
          <p><i>More information will follow. </i></p>
          <p><i>Thanks very much, </i></p>
          <p><i>John Smedley <br>
          Chief Operating Officer <br>
          Sony Online Entertainment </i></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>While this system will help players somewhat in Europe to at least 
        get their hands on a box it does unfortunately severely limit players 
        options with regards to pre-ordering as other online distributors such 
        as EB World (which only ships to some European countries as it is) has 
        shipping costs near to or even over the cost of the expansion itself.&nbsp; 
        The proposal from SOE would see them as virtually the sole distributor 
        for the title if shipping costs are going to be made as feasible as 
        stated.</p>
        <p>Another question which must be asked is what this will mean for the 
        future distribution of other expansions in Europe and the release of the 
        expansion to other countries such as the Asia/Pacific sector.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>It is interesting to note that one of the best aspects of MMORPG's, 
        the international community building from players all over the world, 
        would appear to be under increasing threat as companies pursue better 
        financial returns from licencing deals and localization.&nbsp; Another title 
        which has also attracted attention from the use of this localizaed 
        implementation is the Shadowbane title with whom Ubisoft is also 
        involved.</p>
        <p>We will keep you updated as more information is released from Sony on 
        this matter.</font></td></tr>

        ------------------------------ <br>
        <br>
        ** Planes of Power Pre-Order Bonus ** <br>
        <br>
        If you pre-order the PoP expansion you will be able to purchase the 
        Planes of Power original soundtrack CD for just an additional $4.95. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        *** Important Notice about Alternate Advancement *** <br>
        <br>
        - When a character has 30 or more AA points, they will receive a red 
        message stating: <br>
        <br>
        Warning: You are currently over the earned Advancement point limit of 
        30. Please spend some of your stored AA points. You will not be able to 
        earn further AA points until you have fewer than 30. On October 21, 
        2002, all points over 30 in your AA pool will be deleted. <br>
        <br>
        It seems appropriate that Advancement points earned prior to the release 
        of Planes of Power be used for abilities from earlier expansions. In 
        addition, many of the Luclin abilities are pre-requisites for Planes of 
        Power abilities. When the servers come up on October 21st, all unused 
        Alternate Advancement point pools over 30 will be wiped. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** New Spell Effects ** <br>
        <br>
        We are implementing a few new spell effects using our new particle 
        effects engine with this patch as a way of easing into the new system. 
        The new effects are faster and give you more control over how they look. 
        We have changed the Display Options menu to accommodate these new 
        options. <br>
        <br>
        On the Display tab of the options window you will now find four options 
        regarding particle effects. The first three, listed under Spell 
        Particles are Near Clip Plane, Density and Opacity. These are the 
        options for controlling the new particle effects. They will not change 
        the old particle effects. The old particles are controlled using the 
        Other Particles option. <br>
        <br>
        Note on Near Clip Plane: This option chooses how close to you particles 
        cease to be visible. So Near allows particles to be seen right up to the 
        character. Farthest will clip out particles near the character and only 
        show those at the 'farthest' distance. <br>
        <br>
        Note on Opacity: This feature works at all settings for cards that 
        support TnL. For other cards setting Opacity to 0% will turn off the 
        effects and any other setting will show them fully. <br>
        <br>
        We'll leave it up to you to discover which spells have the new 
        particles... <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** Alternate Advancement ** <br>
        <br>
        - Beastlords now have access to the Mend Companion ability. <br>
        - Beastlords now have access to three unique class alternate 
        advancements. <br>
        - Permanent Illusion used with Wolf Form should no longer result in a 
        wolf tinted by the Enchanter's robe. <br>
        - Updated Finishing Blow - <br>
        &quot;This ability gives you a chance to finish off an NPC that is below 10 
        percent health and fleeing with a single blow. The first level works on 
        NPC's below 50, the second on NPC's below 52, and the third on NPC's 
        below 54. (Non-Warriors must first train one level of Combat Fury to use 
        this ability.) &quot; <br>
        - Improved Combat Fury for non-warriors to give more value to the points 
        spent after level 1. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** Spells ** <br>
        <br>
        - New Druid and Shaman heal spells are available. <br>
        - The &quot;Your XXX Spell Has Worn Off&quot; messages for DoT spells will now go 
        to the right character. <br>
        - Illusions that are of a character type that can't wear armor, such as 
        werewolf, will no longer cause the character to be naked when the 
        illusion drops. <br>
        - Fixed the Illusion wolf form swimming animation. <br>
        - Shaman and Beastlord Shrink spell has had its location restriction 
        removed. <br>
        - The outcasts of Echo Caverns have deciphered new magics that allow 
        Dark Knights to channel the essence of terror into their enemies minds. 
        While their initial findings have proven very powerful, rumors exist of 
        even greater magics that might channel the nightmares of Terris Thule 
        herself into the minds of mortals. Where that power might be found is 
        not yet known. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** Items ** <br>
        <br>
        - Items that grant bonuses to bandage skill should be working now. <br>
        - Guise of the Hunter no longer makes the user appear to be naked. <br>
        - Validus Custodus Battle Axe no longer looks like a bard mandolin when 
        equipped by a pet. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** PvP Servers and Gameplay ** <br>
        <br>
        - The recent resist changes have been adjusted for PvP. They will not be 
        exactly as they were prior to the resist change, but they should be 
        reasonable now. Please let us know if you feel they need further 
        adjustment. <br>
        - Player characters will no longer lose experience in the Arena areas on 
        the Sullon Zek server. <br>
        - A player character can no longer tell his pet to attack another 
        player's horse when not on a PvP area or in a duel. <br>
        - Kael, Skyshrine, and Thurgadin on Sullon Zek no longer have the newbie 
        protection code active. <br>
        - Players should once again be able to use level-restricted clickable 
        buffs on the Sullon Zek server. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** Pets ** <br>
        <br>
        - Improved Beastlord pets to scale more reasonably with the level of the 
        Beastlord after level 40. This also puts them into line with the last 
        round of pet balancing, which did not improve beastlord pets at the 
        time. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** Horses ** <br>
        <br>
        - Locate corpse songs/spells should now work on horseback. <br>
        - Detect traps should also now work on horseback. <br>
        - Fixed a bug that was preventing manipulation of inventory items if a 
        character died with coins on the cursor. <br>
        - Invisibility on horseback should now make your horse invisible to NPCs 
        as it does the rider. <br>
        - Zoning with Levitate/Levitation and horse no longer causes the 
        levitation to fail. <br>
        - Fixed a bug that would cause the horse 'buff' to disappear when zoning 
        in some zones. <br>
        - Player characters on horseback can now be hit by various missiles, 
        such as arrows, thrown weapons or the various bolt spells from PCs and 
        NPCs. <br>
        - Call of the Hero should no longer put people under the world when the 
        caster is on horseback. <br>
        - Dragging a corpse while on a horse will no longer cause the corpse 
        fall under the world. <br>
        - You can now right click on spells to arrange your spell book when on a 
        horse. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** Zone Specific ** <br>
        <br>
        - We believe that we fixed the major source of lockups caused for 
        players in certain zones such as the Great Divide and Shadowhaven. <br>
        - Hierophant Oxyn in East Cabilis will be showing up again. <br>
        <br>

        ** An Ancient Arises ** <br>
        <br>
        Deep within the recesses of a cave yet unknown to the world at large, a 
        dark, menacing figure parts with the slumber that has kept him silent 
        for ages. The eyes of a magnificently ominous beast pierce through the 
        darkness, his memories flowing freely once more. In the depths of this 
        beast's mind sparks the knowledge that his prophetic savior has been 
        released from the ancient magiks of time, let loose upon an unsuspecting 
        world where the kin shall once again reign supreme. <br>
        <br>
        &quot;My master's shackles have been trounced, and so it is written that in 
        this world that has been so deftly overrun by pitiful mortals, he shall 
        bring power back to those of the scale.&quot; The deep rumbling voice of the 
        beast lingers throughout the cavernous hideaway, the barely 
        distinguishable figure of a mighty lizard moves through the stone and 
        dirt and dust as if to leave the gloomy surroundings and find his place 
        once again upon Norrath proper. <br>
        <br>
        &quot;For far too long have I been a prisoner to the overwhelming might that 
        kept me in a state of secluded sleep; for far too long have I been 
        victim to the ancestral elemental forces keeping my master at bay. Now I 
        awaken and bring life back to the disciples; now shall the lifeblood of 
        the Four once again spread the word of prophecy!&quot; The footsteps of this 
        great beast are slow but sure, moving through the depths of the gaping 
        mountain retreat towards the surface. Along the walls, pebbles and 
        stones that have remained dormant for years crumble and crack, falling 
        to the ground as the immense beast walks past. <br>
        <br>
        A maze of dead ends and broken paths twists and turns in the expanse 
        beyond the figure's resting place. The skeletons of those who had tried 
        - and failed - to make their way to him in the years he spent in forced 
        slumber remain, tumbled landmarks of heroes long lost. Slowly he moves, 
        his reptilian eyes darting back and forth looking for any meager meals 
        that may still be available. As he proceeds, he steps atop a mighty 
        echelon, overlooking the bodies that could not defy the magical 
        properties of the cave; fools of mortal thought, incapable of fathoming 
        the power that lay beyond them. &quot;Time has been good to you, my faithful 
        warren... let us both pray that I no longer need you. The time for the 
        revival is at hand.&quot;</font></td>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Paris, FRANCE - September 19, 2002</b> 
        - Ubi Soft® Entertainment, one of the world's largest video game 
        publishers, and Sony Online Entertainment Inc. (SOE), a worldwide leader 
        in Massively Multiplayer Online gaming, today announced an exclusive 
        publishing agreement to release EverQuest® in Mainland China. SOE will 
        bring its already-acquired technological expertise to the partnership 
        while Ubi Soft's online arm, ubi.com, will provide the necessary local 
        infrastructures to host and operate the game.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Ubi Soft sees the move as a great 
        opportunity to reinforce its presence in Asia, which is the number one 
        market when it comes to online gaming. Through this deal, SOE is excited 
        to bring the largest and most beautiful virtual environment to the 
        world's largest population. Chinese gamers have been eager to access 
        EverQuest, the world's most popular MMO game for a long time. Being huge 
        fans of fantasy role-playing games, they will finally be able to immerse 
        themselves in one of the most detailed 3D worlds ever created </font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">At the beginning of 2003, Chinese MMO 
        gamers will join the more than 430,000 players already subscribed around 
        the world to EverQuest and its top-selling expansions The Ruins of 
        Kunark™, The Scars of Velious™ and The Shadows of Luclin™. The latest 
        expansion to the critically acclaimed EverQuest series, EverQuest: The 
        Planes of Power™ launches in the U.S. on October 21, 2002. In line with 
        Ubi Soft's strategy to adapt its games to countries and cultures around 
        the globe, the game will be fully localized, requiring the translation 
        of more than 1.5 million words in Chinese. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">&quot;I am delighted to strengthen our 
        already fruitful partnership with SOE by expanding our online presence 
        in Asia,&quot; said Gilles Langourieux, managing director of ubi.com. &quot;We are 
        tapping into a significant new source of revenue, and are especially 
        proud to introduce the best 3D MMO game to China.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">&quot;As online gaming continues to grow in 
        popularity, EverQuest is truly creating a global online community,&quot; said 
        John Smedley, senior vice president and chief operating officer, Sony 
        Online Entertainment. &quot;With localization efforts in Europe, Korea and 
        now mainland China, we are working with leading companies like Ubi Soft 
        to continually expand EverQuest to meet increasing global demand.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Ubi Soft is the leading publisher of 
        video games in China, with more than 230 employees in its Shanghai, 
        Beijing and Guangzhou offices. With a total of 13 million MMO gamers - 
        including 5 million already paying for online games on a regular basis* 
        - China represents enormous market potential for Ubi Soft and SOE.

        <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">In a related development, SOE and Ubi 
        Soft are actively preparing a localized version of EverQuest® in Europe, 
        called EverQuest® Renaissance, to be released this fall. In order to 
        better cater to European players, two new Web sites -
