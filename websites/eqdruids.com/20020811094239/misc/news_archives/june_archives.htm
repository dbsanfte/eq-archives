The only thing that takes some getting used to is this.&nbsp; When you don't have your mouse on a particular window, the window fades (becomes almost transparent).&nbsp; When you put the mouse on a window, it fades back into focus.&nbsp; So it allows you to have a window on top of what you are looking at, and still be able to see through the window.&nbsp; This takes a little getting used too, but again I think it is a nice improvement.&nbsp; It opens up the screen a little more.</font></p><p align=left><font face=Arial>&nbsp;- Spiritual</font></td></tr><tr><td height=19><p align=center><font face=Arial><b><a name="Everquest Tournament to be held at GenCon 6/25/02">Everquest Tournament to be held at GenCon 6/25/02</a></b></font></td></tr><tr><td height=19><font face=Arial>Hear Ye, Hear Ye,</font><p><font face=Arial>Calling all EverQuest players to battle.

(The hex nut icon in the window selector, or Alt-O by default). To turn the window selector itself on and off, the default key is Alt-W.</p><p>- Mousewheel: ...should automatically work in every UI screen that has a scroll bar.
