<p align="left">1-4:&nbsp; Rarely can an enemy of your level or lower take you out at
levels 1-4.<br>
Your DD won't do much to them so save the mana for healing.&nbsp; You can keep up<br>
Endure Fire if you want, but it only really helps against another druid.&nbsp; If<br>
you're fighting a melee class, Snare Snare Snare.&nbsp; It's then time to keep<br>
moving and dart in and melee and then step back and hit them with a DD or 2.<br>
Flame Lick should be your first spell after Snare.&nbsp; It won't help too much<br>
against a warrior in patchwork but every little bit helps.&nbsp; Against a caster<br>
use Flame Lick first.&nbsp; With their already low AC this spell will make<br>
hitting them easy.&nbsp; At some point they have to stand still to cast.&nbsp;&nbsp; You<br>
should rarely miss them.&nbsp; Save your mana to heal and then snare them when<br>
they try to run.<br>
<br>
5-8:&nbsp; At these levels you'll find you can't melee with tanks and you can't<br>
kill with spells.&nbsp; Use the methods in the previous section.&nbsp; The only real<br>
difference is that the fights will last longer.&nbsp; At level 5-6 do not even<br>
try to use your new DD spell, Burst of Fire, against another player.&nbsp; Too<br>
much mana, too long to cast, and too many fizzles.&nbsp; A couple of fizzles in a<br>
row will get you killed.&nbsp; Keep your skills maxed to reduce fizzles.&nbsp; Before<br>
you go picking fights, practice Whirling Wind.&nbsp; Get your Conjuration up to a<br>
respectable level and then you're ready to use it on another player.&nbsp; It<br>
does ok damage/mana and the stun can help and does disrupt spells.&nbsp; When<br>
you're in trouble never try to Camo.&nbsp; Gate Instead.&nbsp; Even though you have<br>
Ward Summoned, don't ever bother with pets.&nbsp; It costs too much and is slow<br>
to cast, so just snare the pet and go after the caster.&nbsp; You can use<br>
Grasping Roots if you're picking on easy prey but it gets resisted too much<br>
for me.&nbsp; You can try to heal yourself in a fight but the damage you're<br>
taking at this level will make this useless.&nbsp; The quicker they're dead the<br>
less damage you take.<br>
<br>
9-12:&nbsp; This is where you really find out what a druid can do in PVP.&nbsp; Just<br>
be careful at level 9.&nbsp; You've got the spells but not the mana.&nbsp; It's<br>
depressing to cast off a couple of Ignites and find you don't have any left<br>
for healing.&nbsp; The best tactic I've found is to buff yourself with everything<br>
and then melee while casting Whirling Wind at them.&nbsp; Make sure to Snare<br>
first.&nbsp; They'll have to melee you at that point and your damage shield<br>
really kicks in.&nbsp; Firefist becomes necessary to kill tanks and Endure Cold<br>
is something you have to have against Wizards.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whirling Wind will get<br>
resisted some.&nbsp; Some players use Ignite instead but I almost never seem to<br>
fully hit with it.&nbsp; It's alot of mana to use for 15 pts of dmg.&nbsp; Once your<br>
short buffs run out you're in trouble.&nbsp; Try a mana dump or just get out of<br>
there unless you've got them really hurt.&nbsp; I've had almost dead warriors<br>
drop me from half life to nothing while I tried to finish them with my<br>
staff.&nbsp; When you're tricks run out, it's time to leave.<br>
<br>
It's been fun to fight other players with a druid.&nbsp; They're never really<br>
sure how to come at you.&nbsp; The biggest problem that I've had are clerics.<br>
They're the ones for us to watch out for.&nbsp; Just when you think you've got<br>
them, a couple of heals....<br>
<br>
Krayvex<br>
Rallos Zek<br>
<br>
When people talk of good classes to use in a PvP environment you<br>
typically hear about the hybrids (SK, PAL) or the power-casters (WIZ,<br>
NECRO)<br>
Smart players will often mention Clerics or Encanters, and rightfully<br>
so.<br>
<br>
But dont overlook the Druid. Druids have an amazing range of tools at<br>
their disposal. Lets look at a few of them and their impact in a PvP<br>
setting:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Equipment:<br>
<br>
1) Weapons available- 1h and 2h blunt and 1h slashing with a scimitar.<br>
Druids have access to some of the best, readily attainable weapons in<br>
the game. Including the sreaming mace, bloodorge hammer, various fine<br>
steel, combine and others such as the Ogre War Maul etc. This far<br>
outweighs what other mage type classes are capable of getting and using.<br>
Giving us a huge melee advantage when compared to other pure casters,<br>
even the cleric may be at a disadvantage when comparing variety of<br>
weapons available. Many of the best weapons for mage types are also<br>
usuable by us. While few of ours are usuable by them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2) Armor available- While the cleric certainly has us beat in this<br>
department, no other class with spells even remotely as powerful as ours<br>
comes close. Wearing up to leather level armor sure beats wearing cloth<br>
for 35 levels then finally getting some goissmer or other cloth based<br>
mage armor. From the start we can be equipped with patchwork, leather,<br>
studded, or if we have a kind tradesman friend, even the high AC<br>
reinforced. Some of the more easily available choices are the snakeskin<br>
items from PAW the Lockjaw vest from Oasis, or the high level drakeskin<br>
arms and legs I hear are coming from Solusek. Most of these are pretty<br>
easily obtainable, and in general offer much better protection than<br>
similarly powered casters of other classes have avaiable.<br>
<br>
<br>
Skills:<br>
TRACKING- At level 20 druids get the skill of tracking, while our<br>
tracking is pretty weak compared to that of a ranger it is still<br>
incredibly useful. Use it often to keep tabs on who is around you. Wise<br>
use of this skill can prevent you from getting into a vulnerable<br>
position in the first place. As well as enable you to stick to fleeing<br>
opponents like glue.<br>
<br>
Forage- Might not seem like a good pvp skill but when your fighting your<br>
way back to a body in enemy territory, or setting up an attack run the<br>
last thing you need is to have to run to a friendly town to get food and<br>
water, or wait for teamates to do the same. With high foraging you'll<br>
save many needless trips to town. I expect this and summoning to be used<br>
greatly during prolonged territorial sieges on Talon Zek.<br>
<br>
Hide and Sneak: Not available to all races and not much to worry about<br>
either. Since both of these skills are capped very low they aren't what<br>
you want to have your survival riding on. Depending on these skills they<br>
will get you killed.<br>
<br>
SPELLS:<br>
<br>
Spells are what it really comes down to. I'll list a few of the better<br>
ones and their applications.<br>
<br>
Offensive spells:<br>
<br>
SNARE!!- Snare is one of the most powerful spells we recieve. Being able<br>
to slow your opponents movement to a crawl is an obvious advantage.<br>
Snare uses next to no mana and even when they do resist it you can<br>
usually just run a bit and cast it again.<br>
<br>
Direct Damage- Although some of our DD's have a higher than average<br>
chance of being resisted, overall we get enough of them to take a<br>
serious chunk out of most opponents. Careless lightning is possibly the<br>
most popular of all of them, it is difficult to resist or prepare for,<br>
since there are many more items that give fire resistance than magic<br>
resistance you will find occasions when you may prefer the reliable<br>
damage of careless to the better ratio of the more easily resisted fire<br>
based spells. In general it's better to rely on our DoT's than DD's<br>
though.<br>
<br>
Damage over Time- The swarm-&gt;crud-&gt;drones line of spells may be our best<br>
offensive weapon. They aren't easily resisted and do deceptive amounts<br>
of damage. I prefer using them to the DD spells when time/circumstances<br>
permit. Immolate is ok when you can risk the mana.<br>
<br>
Root- Our root spells are pathetic, easily resisted, do a tiny amount of<br>
damage and have an VERY short duration. Use snare instead.<br>
<br>
Area of Effect- You would think these would be very useful in a racewar<br>
or group PvP battle but most of the time people will be spread out too<br>
thin to hit them all and you will waste mana. Another negative side<br>
effect is that you will often hit nearby MoBs by accident and end up<br>
fighting them too. The aoe spells can be useful when fighting dumb<br>
opponents but it doesn't take long for most groups to realize they need<br>
to spread out a little. The best application is for diversions. Say a<br>
pack of darkies is guarding the entrance to someplace you want to go-<br>
use a rain spell on the lot of them and you can easily lead them on a<br>
merry chase while your camoflauged groupmates sneak past or set up an<br>
ambush point for the chasers, since they will often return one at a time<br>
to the original point. You can take out large groups quickly using<br>
diversionary tactics like this.&nbsp; (example: 8 darkies take chase after<br>
you tremor them, as you lead them around with sow or cheetah you will<br>
innevitbly lose some of them, they usually wander back to the last place<br>
where their party was assembled, where&nbsp; your 5 teamates come out of<br>
invis and whack them fast, 5 on 1, your teamates then re-invis, rinse<br>
and repeat as long as they can.) AOE spells can also make good opening<br>
spells when you have the benefit of surprise attack<br>
<br>
Buffs/Defensive spells- Our skin like wood line is about the most useful<br>
buff useful buff we can share with others. With two obvious exceptions.<br>
SoW and the Shield of Barbs line. Sow gives the speed advantage and the<br>
damaging effects of the shield line can amount to huge numbers in a long<br>
fight. You already know to keep sow in effect but don't forget to have<br>
the shield up ANY time you'll be taking melee damage. Our succor spells<br>
can save lives occasionally but they take so long to cast that you will<br>
rarely get them off in time. It's more important to have SoW memmed to<br>
recast on your teamates when an enemy root or snare has nullified their<br>
SoW.&nbsp; Spirit of the Cheetah can save your life over and over, just make<br>
sure it's available before you count on it. Cancel Magic can be very<br>
useful but you have to go through alot of preparation to make sure that<br>
you cancel the effect you want to, and not just your teamates buffs.<br>
When I think I may be needing cancel magic then I put a dummy buff in<br>
the #1 posistion on the buff stack and remove it after i have casted all<br>
my other buffs, this means that if im rooted, for example, root would be<br>
top on the list of spell effects and therefore the first one to be<br>
effected by use of the cancel magic spell.<br>
<br>
Animal Control Spells- You would be shocked how handy a griffon defender<br>
can be in a pinch, just make sure that whatever animal you charm is high<br>
enough that it will defend you against your enemies. This is more of&nbsp; a<br>
last ditch effort to get them off your back while you flee than anything<br>
else. But it can be ALOT of fun in a hit and run raid on a group.<br>
<br>
<br>
Some situational tactics:<br>
<br>
For a 1 on 1 battle vs melee class: Snare them 1st so that you can<br>
control the pace of the battle and gain the distance needed to cast your<br>
DoTs. One combo that is nice but doesnt let your opponent know how much<br>
trouble he's in until it's too late is this: Step1) fully buff,<br>
including your damage shields. 2) meditate to full mana. 3) snare a<br>
melee'r. 4) DoT him. 5) Melee him a bit(while your dots and damage<br>
shield chew away at him.) 6) run a few steps and re-DoT him. 7) Heal<br>
yourself fully. 8) repeat step 5.&nbsp; You can frustrate almost ANY solo<br>
meleer this way.<br>
<br>
For 1 on 1 vs casters with a pet: You can try this two ways: First<br>
inclination is to think: &quot;take out the pet early&quot; since we get the<br>
dispell summoned line of spells this can be pretty easily done, simply<br>
snare the master and run with his pet chasing you to a safe distance.<br>
Then you can snare the pet snd dispatch him with a few dispells. The<br>
PROBLEM with this tactic is that by the time you have taken out the pet<br>
and made your way back to the master he has had time to summon another<br>
pet or at least has the advantage of being at full mana, while you just<br>
spent a big chunk of yours on his pet. A better method is to start by<br>
snaring the pet and DoTing the master, then lead the master well away<br>
from the pet and snare/dot/nuke him the best you can. Alot of<br>
pet-dependant casters wont know what to do when you've taken their pet<br>
out of the equation. The idea is that you lead them well away from their<br>
pets and let them think they are chasing you, then you stop and stay in<br>
their faces with melee and DD's to disrupt their spells- all while you<br>
cast and use the speed advantage to keep them dotted and the fast<br>
casting of your DD's when your at point blank. DO NOT GIVE THEM TIME TO<br>
CAST. You must keep bombarding and disrupting them.<br>
<br>
For one on one with a petless caster- Wizards are the biggest problem,<br>
they can DD you for more than you can DoT and DD them in the same time<br>
if you let them. However since they have no pets you can cause them to<br>
become disrupted pretty easily. We also have the advantage of being able<br>
to speed off the screen and heal ourselves. But stay ON them as much as<br>
possible, your better melee skills will help keep him disrupted while<br>
your damage shield and DoT chew on them. Even at mid levels careless<br>
lightning can be useful here, fire resistance doesnt help them and the<br>
low casting time/mana consumption keeps theyre health dropping. Watch<br>
out for being rooted, and keep cheetah ready in case you do get rooted.<br>
While rooted dump mana into staying at full health. Since most wizard<br>
will root, back off and nuke you may be able to force a stalemate with<br>
your heals. If you outlast the root immediatly cheetah to the nearest<br>
zone, with a pause to fully heal before you zone. If you need to keep<br>
the fight going then cheetah to the zone, then re-sow, camo and possibly<br>
even med a bit first near the zone as he tries to catch up with you.<br>
Like all enemies keep them on tracking as much as you can. Remeber<br>
cheetah's recast rate means you wont have a second quick escape until<br>
you re-zone.<br>
<br>
<br>
Solo against a group: No matter how you slice it this is always risky<br>
business. You best hope is to use trickery to seperate them. Some<br>
tactics I have found to be succesful are:<br>
<br>
1) When there are only 2 enemies: Snare one and let the other chase you<br>
while you DoT and or Nuke. Get a good distance then snare him as well.<br>
Now DoT, Nuke and Melee as needed, the more mana you can save on the<br>
first kill the better your chances of taking the second opponent. Who<br>
will, by this time looking for you with a vengeance if he's worth his<br>
salt. Like I said always keep cheetah ready cause you never know when<br>
things will take a turn for the worse.<br>
<br>
2) When there are three or more enemies: You're taking a greater risk<br>
but you can sometimes have success using extreme trickery. One method<br>
that works sometimes is to bind on one side of the enemy group then<br>
circle around behind them to sneak up on them and snare one their weaker<br>
members. Then you lead the unsnared pack of enemies in one direction.<br>
You may have to use cheetah but if you can get enough distance you can<br>
gate back to where you bound and run up behind that weaker member you<br>
snared to begin with. If you led his teamates far enough away you can<br>
often kill him and escape before they return. Try shouting something<br>
like &quot;...and then there were five!&quot; after a successful use of this ploy.<br>
Just for fun. Make sure that where you bind is close enough to a zone<br>
that if you do die you will be able to escape a second quick death to<br>
the same enemies. A less risky variation is to do it only in zones that<br>
have rings you can teleport to. So that you don't have to bind and risk<br>
being killed twice in a row by the same group.<br>
<br>
Group vs Group: These situations vary so greatly that I couldn't begin<br>
to cover all the scenarios. Some general tips include: Keep everyone<br>
sow'd and be ready to re-sow them as often as needed, especially when an<br>
enemy spell has made it lose effect. Heal them and keep them<br>
damage-shielded in melee. Use DoT's instead of nukes, they draw less<br>
attention your way and that allows you to heal more or even succor some<br>
times. Stay buffed and keep your teamates buffed. Remember your solo<br>
tactics and use them when you can. Try and break up large enemy groups<br>
and go ahead and use AOE spells when they make the mistake of letting<br>
you. Use every advantage you have. Especially the speed advantage. Don't<br>
over-rely on your speed or any one thing though, mix it up alot. Excpect<br>
to have to snare the enemy to outrun them and assume they have sow or<br>
jboots too. Most importantly- appoint a leader for the group based on<br>
performance, just because im higher level than you doesn't mean im a<br>
better leader or tactician. You need one guy assigned to taking the role<br>
of leader on the battefiled and keeping eveyone doing what the group<br>
expects of them. Assuming your teamate is doing one thing when he's<br>
doing another can lead to a quick death and lost battle. Since druids<br>
have the most wide ranging set of abilities they tend to be versed with<br>
lots of different types of scenarios and often make excellent leaders,<br>
but it's really an individual thing. You want a leader that feels that<br>
the only things more important than his survival is the survival of his<br>
groupmates and accomplishing the mission.<br>
<br>
Hope this comes in handy for the time being.<br>
