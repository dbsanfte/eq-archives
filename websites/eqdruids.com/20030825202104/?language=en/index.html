      <li>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Augmentations will not be character

      <li>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial">You will know what the augmentation will 
    do before you apply it.&nbsp; So no surprises.</font></p>

    ------------------------------<br>
    <br>
    Note: Some internal data restructuring created a delay in the introduction 
    of the new platinum slot in the shared bank and the new text filters. We 
    will bring those to the Live servers as soon as we can.<br>
    <br>
    ** New Adventure in Lavastorm! **<br>
    <br>
    In the depths of the Lavastorm Mountains there is only one ruler. But even 
    his burning breath and power have their limits. Rumor has it that there is 
    wealth and danger in locations even further below the boiling lands than 
    Lord Nagafen can reach. These tales have been spreading like ripples on a 
    calm lake, and their point of origin appears to be an upstart barbarian 
    named Morden. Some say that he's already delved these fabled caverns and 
    taken what there was of value. Other say that he couldn't have carried it 
    all off by himself. But most say that he's a rogue, a teller of tales, and 
    not to be trusted. Will you discover the truth and brave the heat, or will 
    you sit beside your cozy campfire and listen to stories?<br>
    <br>
    This new adventure zone will only be around for a while, so you may want to 
    visit soon.<br>
    <br>
    ** Spells **<br>
    <br>
    - Summoned Burning Affliction focus items added - Mages have four new 
    spells, Summon Wooden Bracelet, Summon Stone Bracelet, Summon Iron Bracelet, 
    and Summon Steel Bracelet. The bracelets summoned provide the Burning 
    Affliction effect for DoT spells.<br>
    <br>
    - Summoned container spells updated - The Quiver of Marr, Bandoleer of 
    Luclin and the Pouch of Quellious now appear filled with the appropriate 
    item (for example, the Quiver of Marr now appears with six stacks of 
    arrows). Also, these items should all be exactly the same, so the quiver 
    function should work properly.<br>
    <br>
    - Mass Enchant spells corrected - The mass enchant spells for Adamantite, 
    Brellium, Mithril and Steel now create the 5 enchanted blocks that they 
    should.<br>
    <br>
    - Illusion: Guktan is available - This is an illusion spell for the new 
    Froglok models.<br>
    <br>
    - Illusion: Scaled Wolf is available - This is an illusion spell for the 
    Scaled Wolf seen in Kunark.<br>
    <br>
    - Tiny Companion - The spell scroll for this spell is no longer No Drop.<br>
    <br>
    - Dooming Darkness no longer overwrites Cascading Darkness.<br>
    <br>
    ** Items **<br>
    <br>
    - Moss Covered Hood - This item can now be equipped by all classes.<br>
    <br>
    - Silk String - This item is now stackable.<br>
    <br>
    ** Trade Skills **<br>
    <br>
    - New Fletching recipes added - We've added several new Karana-only 
    fletching recipes to help round out that skill.<br>
    <br>
    ** Quests and Zones **<br>
    <br>
    - Halls of Betrayal - Corrected an error with some of the quest item drops 
    in this zone.<br>
    <br>
    - Plane of Time - The events in Plane of Time B now remember the progress 
    your raid has made through the zone when you leave and will restore you to 
    the same state when you return.<br>
    <br>
    - Kagazz will respond when you ask him about fasteners.<br>
    <br>
    - Experience in city zones updated - Some time around the release of Planes 
    of Power we reduced the experience gain in some city zones. Tthe experience 
    gained from quests in those zone has been increased.<br>
    <br>
    - Ogre newbie quests - Added a weapon quest for young ogres.<br>
    <br>
    - Iksar Necromancer Spell Vendors - The Iksar necromancer spell vendors have 
    moved and are a lot closer to the necromancer guild. This should make it 
    easier for new necromancers to find these vendors and will hopefully boost 
    their sales.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    ** Miscellaneous **<br>
    <br>
    - Spell book bug - Corrected a bug that was causing characters to be 
    randomly forced to stand up when in their spell book.<br>
    <br>
    - Client crash information - If your game crashes on the client side, a 
    dialogue box will come up asking if you'd like to send us the information 
    about the crash. This information may help us pinpoint problems and make it 
    easier to fix them. Only information relevant to the crash, your character 
    name, server name and the zone you were in will be sent.<br>
    <br>

    <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Lost Dungeons of Norrath will introduce a 
    new EverQuest feature: <strong>Interactive Objects</strong>! These are 
    boxes, vases, chests and similar objects that might contain treasures. There 
    are several ways to interact with these objects:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">You can inspect an object, and learn something about 
    that object. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">But, be careful! Some of these objects may be 
    booby-trapped. Poking around a booby-trapped object might set it off. 
    However, if your character has the appropriate skills, you can Sense or 
    Disarm the traps on these objects. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Other objects may be locked. But, if your character 
    has a Pick Lock skill, you may be able to open the lock. Or if you're the 
    more brutal type, you may be able to just bash the object apart. Of course, 
    brute force could set off any hidden traps. Note that if these skills fail, 
    there will be few spells that can allow you to open locked objects. </font>

    LDoN 8/4/03</b></u></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial">From LDoN website:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">The Lost Dungeons of Norrath introduces an exciting 
    new type of treasure to EverQuest. Using new modular items gained from 
    dungeon adventures, characters are able to modify the powers and effects of 
    their equipment, allowing for a tremendous amount of customization.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Using these new items, characters can augment an 
    existing breastplate, for example. Bonding the proper augmentation item to 
    the breastplate might give it +5 strength. Bonding a different augmentation 
    item could give it +6 wisdom. These are just a few simple examples; the new 
    items have a wide variety of possible effects and benefits.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Have a helmet that you like, but think needs a little 
    boost? This new item system allows you to customize that helmet and make it 
    fit your character's needs better. Most characters have a favorite item that 
    they've had in their bank for a while. They don't want to destroy it because 
    it holds some memories, a link to the adventures they had gaining it. With 
    this new item augmentation system, those items gain new life and endless 
    potential!</font></p>

    of us behind the scenes here on the EverQuest team have plans for the future 
    of the game.<span style>&nbsp; </span>Further Down the Line is where we will keep 
    you informed about what those plans are.<span style>&nbsp; </span>Please 
    understand that these are our long-term plans and may require a fair amount 
    of research or development time.</font></p>

    Several partial zone revamps coming to the Live servers.</b><span style>&nbsp;
    </span>Though delayed several weeks, we are working to complete the partial 
    revamps of several zones:<span style>&nbsp; </span>The Deep, Charasis (Howling 
    Stones), Dragon Necropolis, Siren's Grotto, The Hole, The City of Mist, and 
    Velketor's Labyrinth.<span style>&nbsp; </span>We chose these zones to update 
    based on feedback from players, and plan to implement changes that will make 
    these zones more entertaining to play in.</font></p>

    trickster, Bristlebane.<span style>&nbsp; </span>One of the most unusual places 
    to visit in EverQuest, this zone is in need of a revamp.<span style>&nbsp; </span>
    We're looking at it now and plan to have changes ready for Legends later in 
    August.<span style>&nbsp; </span>We'll be keeping the wacky style of the place 
    while at the same time making it a bit more playable.</font></p>

    <font face="Arial">We're still planning to take a look at improving the 
    damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen behind their 
    magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game.&nbsp; Finding the 
    proper solutions for this situation will take some time.&nbsp; Some options being 
    considered are:</font></span></p>

    <font face="Arial">We're planning on reviewing the possibility of giving an 
    innate chance to block when using a shield.&nbsp; We've been hoping to do this 
    for a while, and it should be getting a realistic review in the near 
    future.&nbsp; We'd like to increase the value of shields, and make it a 
    worthwhile choice for players who might normally dual-wield weapons or use a 
    two-handed weapon.&nbsp; We plan on balancing this against classes which use 
    shields by default, and therefore wouldn't be making any trade-offs to equip 
    a shield.</font></span></p>
