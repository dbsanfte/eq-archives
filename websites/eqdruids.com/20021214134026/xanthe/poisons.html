Do you need a little extra punch in combat? Having trouble with a particular mob that you just can't quite handle? Or are you a dyed in the wool roleplayer, who just has to have that discrete inside jacket pocket full of innoccuous, yet deadly little vials at your disposal for that special occasion? Whatever the reasons for your interest, poisons can be a fascinating, and extremely useful, addition to your arsenal as a well prepared Rogue.
</p>



The art of making poisons has always been a thing of great interest to me, and I have always wanted to try my hand at it, but due to lack of free character slots I have never had the opportunity. Fortunately for me, I now have access to a second EQ account, and my little rogue is coming along quite nicely:) (As yet I do not have a huge amount of experience in being a rogue, but I'm doing my best. If you see anything that I haven't got quite right, please let me know, and I can be embarassed). In preparation for his foray into the deadly arts, I have been doing a pile of research into a reasonable route for him to gain skill efficiently.<p><br>

The rest of this page is the result of my diggings, but I wish to point out that the material here has all been gathered from various other websites all over the place. The route itself has been devised by me, as is the case with the rest of this website, but it would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of those who went before me (although it's getting difficult to tell who found things out first, and who collated them into other sites from original material:). The two most useful sites I have been to are <a href="http://kikyara.tripod.com">Kiky's Poisonous Pages</a>, quite probably the most complete resource for poisons ever made, and <a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse</a>, which also has forums where discussion of anything roguish takes place. Assassin's, I salute you!
<p><br>

<p><img src="mortar.jpg" align="left" width="49" height="49">
And now, on to business. This skill is convoluted as hell and has been a nightmare to sift into a reasonable route for two main reasons.<p><br>
<b>I :</b> The ingredients needed are mostly NPC drops and are found all over the place.<p><br>

<b>II :</b> Depending on your race, there can be problems getting hold of said ingredients due to unreasonable NPCs who wish to discuss the removal of you vital organs. After they have removed them.<p><br>

In the end I found that the easiest way to do this was to make two routes. One for "good" races, and one for "evil" races. Having said that, there are some instances, particularly in the "evil" route that require you to take a few chances. You may have to go near NPCs who may have cause to dislike you. IF A STEP IN THE TABLE IS EVEN REMOTELY DANGEROUS, IT HAS BEEN MARKED BY A RED BACKGROUND.<p>This is to give you plenty of warning that there may be a danger to your person. As yet I have not scouted out these vendors and places so I cannot be sure who is KOS and who is not, but I hope to do this in the very near future. For safety's sake, just assume that you are KOS and work from there. An explanation as to what the exact danger is will be included after the tables, and can (hopefully, if i get it right) be skipped straight to by using the embedded anchor links.<p><br>

<b>Note:</b> As a rogue you have ways of getting people to talk to you even if they don't want to. Use these to your advantage. The poor man's method is good old hide and sneak. Sneak up behind the appointed dupe and con him. He should now be indifferent, and you can buy whatever you like from him. If you feel it is necessary due to other NPCs in the area, hide first and crawl your way over. (uncertain if buying from a vendor breaks Hide, will test this tonight). If you suspect that you may normally be KOS then this method should work, although be aware that some types of NPC DO see through sneak and hide. If you can, get a sow before you try it. Also, when sneaking up on a lone KOS NPC, you are generally ok as long as you stay behind them. You could do the can can and they couldnt care less. But DON'T go around the front. Sneak does not make you invisible. Try not to find out the hard way.<p><br>
The second method is somewhat easier and less worrisome. Masks. Those lovely masks you sometimes come across that make you look like another race. Please remember to con from afar first though, as you never know, someone might see through your disguise. Better safe than dead.</p><br>

Pretty long so far eh? Bear with me there is a lot more to come. Here are some flash anchor links to take you to places if you don't want to read all the intro. Good eh?<p><br>

<b><u><font size=+2><a name="sectioningred">Ingredients and the Routes</a></b></u></font>
<br><br>
There are a great deal more poisons that can be made than just the few that are shown here. They are made of all those weird things you sometimes see on vendors and wonder "what the hell is <i>that</i> for?" Some of these things are quite expensive. They also come from all corners of Norrath, and occasionally you need to visit more than one corner in order to make a single type of poison.<p>

This can be a bit of a pain if you are on foot, so I have attempted to exclude any poisons that use obscure, rare, or distant ingredients. In some cases I could have chosen a poison that is slightly cheaper to make the one I have actually chosen, but it may have had components that would take ages to get in quantity and wasted a lot of your time and effort just to save a couple of platinum.<p><br>

Having said that, you are going to spend a LOT of money getting good at this skill. I have high level rogue friends who are perpetually broke from their love of poisons. I have done my best to chose a viable route that is fairly quick and fairly cheap, but there are stages that can't be avoided unless you want to spend months harvesting uncommon drops from green mobs.<p>As I mentioned before there are many more poisons that can be made and if a particular stage is not to your liking, or you would like to see what else you might try, I highly recommend that you visit <a href="http://kikyara.tripod.com">Kiky's Poisonous Pages</a>. This is the most complete guide to poisons that I have found and it has information on every aspect of poisoning that you could wish to learn.<p><br>

<b>Note:</b> You will most likely be spending a fair bit of time in Lavastorm Mountains. If you like, get yourself a map. There are many ingredients which drop here and in the adjoining Solusek zones. Checking the Gypsy vendor at the druid ring can also bring great rewards.<br>Also, Everfrost is home to several poisonous components which you can make use of if you are going to be in that area. If you are of a good/neutral disposition you have the added bonus of being able to check the vendors in Halas, as a lot of these componenets are sold on by other players.<p><br><br>

<b><u><font size=+2><a name="sectioneffects">Effects and Applying your Posion</a></b></u></font><br><br>

The poisons you make will have differing effects and strengths depending on which recipe you are using. There are 16 types of effects, and each effect has five (ish) grades of strength, sometimes referred to as tiers, fifth grade being the strongest. In the tables, the tier will be denoted by roman numerals ie. a 5th grade Injected poison will be referred to as Injected V.  I will quickly outline the basic effects of each type here, for in depth information visit <a href="http://kikyara.tripod.com">Kiky's Poisonous Pages</a>.<p><br>

<b>Berserker Madness:</b> Increases mob strength and AC, direct damage (DD) and damage over time (DoT) to mob.<p>

<b>Blind:</b> Blinds your opponents for set duration and reduces their attack skill.<p>

<b>Brittle Haste:</b> Increase mob attack speed, decrease mob AC and strength.<p>

<b>Contact:</b> DD to mob.<p>

<b>Dizzy:</b> Decrease mob agility and AC.<p>

<b>Feeble Mind:</b> Reduces mob mana.<p>

<b>Flesh Rot:</b> Decrease mob dexterity, DD and DoT on mob.<p>

<b>Injected:</b> Small DD, DoT on mob.<p>

<b>Liquid Silver:</b> Undead only DD.<p>

<b>Lower Resist:</b> Decrease all resists except poison.<p>

<b>Muscle Lock:</b> Snares mob (reduces movement rate).<p>

<b>Paralyzing Root:</b> Roots mob, reduces mob attack speed.<p>

<b>Poison Animal:</b> DD versus animal mobs only.<p>

<b>Poison Summoned:</b> DD versus summoned mobs only (pets).<p>

<b>System Shock:</b> DD, knock back target, very short stun.<p>

<b>Weaken:</b> Reduces mob strength.<p>

<p><img src="dagger5.jpg" align="left" width="46" height="45"><b>Applying Your Poison</b> is a seperate skill to making it. You get this skill at level 18, and you need to train points into it. Each poison has a skill level at which it becomes trivial to apply. This is NOT the trivial level to MAKE the poison, it's the trivial level for the Apply Poison skill. The Apply tivial generally seems to be slightly higher than the skill level needed to make it, although generally you rarely fail to apply any poison you can make.</p><br>

To apply your poison you need to take a PIERCING weapon on your mouse pointer and click it onto the bottle of poison. This will cause you to sit down and begin applying the poison. The process takes around 7 seconds, but is reported to get faster as your skill at applying increases. If you suceed, your PRIMARY WEAPON SLOT is now poisoned, not the weapon itself. Your next hit with even your bare hands will cause the poison to be activated, after which it is gone.<p> This means that you cannot poison a weapon and move it to your offhand slot, then poison another for you primary slot. If you wish to poison again you must apply more, which involves sitting again. If you fail to apply your poison, then the poison is lost. So it is a good idea to use those poisons that you are making to train your applying skills up on, because you wont be wanting to waste any high end ones once you can make them. The first "block" of poisons on the tables (spider venom  to asp poison) are good for training on.
<p>
The poison will stay on your blade until you<p>
(a) Use it.<p>
(b) Zone.<p>
(c) Camp.<p>
(d) Get disconnected. p<p><br>


<b><u><font size=+2><a name="sectionstarted">Getting Started</a></b></u></font><br><br>

<p><img src="mortar.jpg" align="left" width="49" height="49">Ok, now that that is all out of the way we can get down to the business of actually making a poison. What do you need?<p>

You need to buy from a poison vendor a Mortar and Pestle. This is a six slot container with a combine button. Not all poison vendors sell these, but you can get one from Toxdil in West Freeport, Conium Darkblade in Dagnor's Cauldron, Gindlin Toxfodder in West Karana, Brak Daggermist in Firiona Vie, and Nubs Blackgranite in Lake of Ill Omen.<p>

Aswell as your mortar and pestle, for each poison you attempt to make you must also have the appropriate Poison Vial and Suspension. There are three types of poison vial (poison/lined/sealed) and you can either buy them from a vendor, or make them via the tradeskill pottery. I have included the recipes for all three vials at the end of this page, and if you wish to master pottery in a hurry, please visit the <a href="pottery1.html">pottery</a> section of this website. There are four types of suspension (suspension/constrict/larent/etheral) and these can only be bought from vendors. The first three are sold by most poison vendors, but Etheral suspension can only be bought from Brak Daggermist in Firiona Vie, or Clara in Thurgadin.<p>

Finally there are the poisonous components themselves. Place all of these things into your mortar and pestle, being certain not to stack any of them, and press combine. If you are succesful you will have a shiny new bottle of poison, ready to be used on some poor individual. These bottles do not stack, nor can you fashion them into "multi-shot" bottles like the shaman alchemical potions. Which is a crying shame, and also a space hogger. If you fail to make your poison, you will get your vial back.<p><br>

I am uncertain as to whether or not this skill is level capped (like Alchemy). Some people say yes, others say no, and your guess is as good as mine (or theirs). However one thing that seems to be agreed upon is that your skill cannot exceed 200 until you are past level 50. After that it either goes up in increments of 5 points per level, or all at once. I don't know.</p><br>

As a final word, you will most probably spend a whole pile of cash on this, a whole lot of time, and a whole lot of effort. It is worth knowing that, unlike regular trade skills, you CAN train points into poison making at any skill level. It will still cost you money, but if you're getting to the stage where you're just not getting anywhere, then this option is available to you. Conium Darkblade is whispered to be the only rogue trainer who can train you past 200 though. He's on the island in Dagnor's Cauldron.<p><br>

Ok, that's the lot. If anyone saw anything there that is incorrect please email me and let me know, and I wil do my best to verify it and change things accordingly. Thank you for taking the time to read all of that, and now here are the routes!<p><br><br>




<b><u><font size=+2><a name="goodroute">The "Good" Route</a></font></b></u><p>
<br>
Depending on what materials you have available, I have provided in some cases a choice of poisons to make to fill a certain skill level range. Where there is a choice for a certain skill range, these poisons have been "blocked" together on the table by a colour band. For instance, at first you can make either Spider Venom, Snake Venom, or Asp Poison to get to roughly the same skil level, so these are in the same "block". That is why the tables are stipey.<p>

<b><u><a name="ingloc">Notes:</a></u></b><p><br>

<b><a name="alocroot">Alocassia Root</a></b> is sold by Gindlin Toxfodder in West Karana. Marked as RED on the "evil" table, as he is a human vendor and I am not certain if he likes Dark Elves.<p><br>

<b><a name="ashroot">Ashroot</a></b> drops from Imps in Solusek B and Lavastorm.<p><br>

<b><a name="asmag">Asmag Weed</a></b> drops from Fire Goblins in Lavastorm (camp near Najena).<p><br>

<b><a name="aspsac">Asp Venom Sac</a></b> drops from Asps in Oasis, North and South Ro, and East Commons.<p><br>

<b><a name="basikeye">Basilisk Eyestalk</a></b> drops from Basilisks in Lavastorm.<p><br>

<b><a name="wormwood">Bundle of Wormwood</a></b> is sold by Ennixy Frennor in Steamfont Mountains. Marked as RED on the tables, as I am uncertain to whom she/he is hospitable.<p><br>

<b><a name="lightstone">Burntout Lightstone</a></b> drops from Willowisps all over the place. Common drop, and I always thought they were only for chanty research.....<p><br>

<b><a name="meat">Chunk of Meat</a></b> drops from various meaty animals all over the place, don't even bother to hunt it, just buy it from the vendors at around 1sp each.<p><br>

<b><a name="chromowing">Chromodrac Wing</a></b> drops from Chromodracs in Skyfire Mountains. A popular hunting spot for these (and anything else) is near a zoneline, usually Burning Woods. They dispell you (SoW and anything else they can manage), and DoT, and the zone is teeming with other nasties just waiting to feast on your carcass after they kill you, which can happen very quickly. Take a few friends with you. Also these are frequently found on vendors.<p><br>

<b><a name="coyotetail">Coyotetail</a></b> is sold by Gindlin Toxfodder in West Karana. Marked as RED on the "evil" table, as he is a human vendor and I am not certain if he likes Dark Elves.<p><br>

<b><a name="creeperivy">Creeper Ivy</a></b> is sold by Brak Daggermist in Firiona Vie. I would imagine that Spirit of Sloth would be a rather expensive way of skilling up, but if you don't want to hunt Chromodracs, then this is a viable option. Not included in the "evil" lists as I am not sure how a Dark Elf who hasnt worked on his faction would fare walking into Firiona Vie.<p><br>

<b><a name="cmarrow">Crystallized Marrow</a></b> drops from Ice Boned Skeletons in Everfrost, Befallen and Rather Mountains. Marked as RED on the "evil" list because if you hunt this in Everfrost you may have to dodge the guards, and Tundra Jack who roams. They don't like you. Not one bit.<p><br>

<b><a name="cnightshade">Crystal Nightshade</a></b> is sold by Nubs Blackgranite in Lake of Ill Omen inside the windmill.<p><br>

<b><a name="dmarrow">Darkbone Marrow</a></b> drops from Dark Bone Skeletons in Najena, Unrest and Befallen.<p><br>

<b><a name="delph">Delphinium</a></b> is sold by Gindlin Toxfodder in West Karana. Marked as RED on the "evil" table, as he is a human vendor and I am not certain if he likes Dark Elves.<p><br>

<b><a name="dogbane">Dogbane</a></b> is sold by Anelia Thrywiel in Lesser Faydark. Marked as RED on the lists because this is Lesser Faydark. Brownies. Screaming. Horrible, horrible dying. I went there once for a wander, before I learned of the viciousness that is Brownie. If you don't know what I am talking about, you have never been rooted by an ankle high demon and nuked to see your maker. At level 40. Get a wolf form and everything is fine though, but remember it wears off when you zone.<p><br>

<b><a name="dust">Embalming Dust</a></b> drops from Mummies of various kinds in Oasis, North and South Ro and Befallen.<p><br>

<b><a name="gpetal">Gelsemium Petals</a></b> are sold by Elona McMahon in Halas above the bank. Not included in the "evil" list because you would die very quickly. Unless you had a mask.<p><br>

<b><a name="groot">Gelsemium Root</a></b> is also sold by Elona McMahon in Halas above the bank.<p><br>

<b><a name="waspsac">Giant Wasp Venom Sac</a></b>drops from Giant Wasps on Faydwer and in Misty Thicket. Non stackable.<p><br>

<b><a name="gravemold">Gravemold</a></b> drops from Ghouls, and also in Unrest.<p><br>

<b><a name="garlic">Ground Garlic</a></b> is sold by Jerris W'selo and Kanthu M'rekkor in Neriak Third Gate.<p><br>

<b><a name="ironsulph">Iron Sulphide</a></b> is made by combining 1 Brimstone and 2 Small Pieces of Ore in your mortar and pestle. Brimstone is sold by Ennixy Frennor in Steamfont.<p><br>

<b><a name="king">King's Thorn</a></b> is sold by Ennixy Frennor in Steamfont. Marked as RED on the lists, as I am not certain to whom he/she/it is hospitable.<p><br>

<b><a name="lactera">Lactera</a></b> is sold by Gindlin Toxfodder in West Karana. Marked as RED on the "evil" table, as he is a human vendor and I am not certain if he likes Dark Elves.<p><br>

<b><a name="lixtwing">Lixt Wing Stalk</a></b> drops from Snow Orcs in Everfrost.<p><br>

<b><a name="pbile">Putrid Bile</a></b> drops from Fire Drakes in Lavastorm.<p><br>

<b><a name="quicksilver">Quicksilver</a></b> is made by combining 1 Gnomish Spirits, and 1 Cinnabar in your mortar and pestle. Cinnarbar is sold by Myre in South Kaladim by the bank.<p><br>

<b><a name="hellbore">Red Hellbore</a></b> is sold by Jerris W'selo and Kanthu M'rekkor in Neriak Third Gate.<p><br>

<b><a name="skybile">Skyash Bile</a></b> drops from Skyfire Drakes in Skyfire Mountains. Nasty place, refer to Chromodrac Wings above.<p><br>

** Most pelts can be used for this, as long as they are NOT Ruined, ie. You can use a Low Quality Cat Pelt, but not a Ruined Cat pelt. Puma Skins work, as do Black Wolf Skins and Zombie Skins (these stack, which can save a lot of room). Lion Skins DON’T work, and neither do Snake Skins or Shadow Wolf Pelts.. Up until now the new Velious Pelts such as Cougar, Dire Wolf, Kodiak etc don’t work either, but I shall do more testing with these to see if it has changed since I last checked.<br><p><br>
