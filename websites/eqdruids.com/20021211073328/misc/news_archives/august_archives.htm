        <font face="Arial">Rich Waters (Lead Designer at Verant/Sony) left some 
        good comments on the Dev Board that I thought people should read:</font><p>
        Putting new ideas on the Test server is really an interesting thing to 
        do sometimes. On the one hand, players are constantly requesting 
        upgrades, changes, new features... yet when we need to test some of 
        these new ideas out to see how they work in a real situation, lots of 
        people jump up and down in a rage. This is aggravated by the fact that 
        often people have incomplete information, so the new change may not even 
        be what they think it is. New features, changes, and ideas on Test 
        server are there to be tested. They may go live after some testing, they 
        may get significantly changed, or they may end up not working out and 
        being removed from test. <br>
        <br>
        If you see changes on Test that you like or dislike, by all means send 
        in some feedback and let us know what you think - we're always happy to 
        get more input from players. It also works to just post your opinions 
        and reasons on one of the many class message boards in the EQ community, 
        everyone on the dev team reads many of those boards each day and keeps 
        up on the hot topics concerning each class. <br>
        <br>
        The game has grown and shifted enormously from when it was initially 
        released, and the role of each class has changed in many ways. Some 
        classes have worked out fairly well, some have seen significant changes 
        in the past, and certainly a few need some meaningful alterations to fit 
        into present-day EverQuest. We're well aware that not all classes have 
        grown equally over time. When the game was originally designed, no 
        classes needed to have things like a defining raid role, as frequent 
        raiding simply didn't exist in the original view of the game. Over time, 
        many new factors have popped up and were retroactively squeezed into 
        class balance, with varying degrees of success. It's our goal that all 
        classes have a vital role, scale well with other members of their class, 
        and remains desirable in many situations. Attaining and keeping that 
        balance with so many classes and play-styles is a slow process to get 
        right. It's better for everyone involved if we take the time to 
        correctly balance and test before moving to live servers, as it causes 
        tremendous amounts of frustration to players when we need to change an 
        item or ability they already are using. <br>
        <br>
        Some of the things we're working on right now will be controversial - 
        some players are going to love them, and others are sure to be angry 
        about the changes. By the time these changes are done, the game will be 
        healthier, more entertaining, and better balanced for the majority of 
        players. I know it's hard for people to keep a positive outlook when big 
        things are changing around them and they don't necessarily see how it 
        will turn out in the end, but I hope you'll continue to be patient and 
        try to believe we have the good of all classes very much in mind as our 
        goal. <br>
        <br>
        Some big changes on Test right now include the introduction of some new 
        healing spells for priest classes. This is a sticky topic with many 
        players, especially as it's left clerics with concerns about their 
        desirability to groups and raids. The decision to make some changes to 
        clerics has been a long time coming and much debated before we decided 
        to move ahead with it. Clerics are an unusual class as at high levels 
        they become mandatory for raid encounters, but often are thought of as 
        unneeded in high level groups, and lack the ability to solo efficiently. 
        With the introduction of some better raid-level heals for shamans and 
        druids, clerics can be assured that we're intending to give them more 
        versatility and greatly improve their group and solo roles. It should be 
        possible to have any priest class function as an effective healer, but 
        if you want the best and most efficient healing you'll always get that 
        from a cleric. I'll stop by the cleric board and make a post about more 
        of the cleric specific concerns, but you can be certain that the new 
        heal spells for the other priests are not going to make clerics obsolete 
        by any stretch of the imagination - expect for the role of a cleric to 
        become more entertaining, versatile, and valued soon. <br>
        <br>
        Classes are continually being looked at and revised. If there are 
        legitimate issues with your class, we'll certainly be addressing them 
        over time. We're working our way through the classes and given time 
        we'll be addressing each class with any needed fixes. These things take 
        time, but we're committed to bringing you the best game possible. <br>

        <p>The Developers’ Corner never really seemed appropriate in the format

        coupled with the fact that the authentication method we were using for

        us to rethink the presentation of this information. </p>

        (including archives of all the old Dev Corner information) is available

        <font face="Arial">Verant is looking at ways to change DoTs in the game.&nbsp; 
        The change being looked at is to allow the same DoT to be cast on a mob, 
        by multiple people.<p>This would increase the damage available to DoT 
        casters by an enormous degree.&nbsp; Imagine 6 druids all casting winged 
        death on a mob, and all the castings do damage.</p>
        <p>Anyway, I missed posting the first announcement (slacker that I am) 
        so I'm posting the follow up announcement :)</p>
        </font><font face="verdana" size="2">
        <p>In the first announcement regarding DoT stacking last week one of the 
        drawbacks mentioned was as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;Unfortunately, the 15 effect limit is a totally different beast. 
          It's one we'd like to tackle at some point, but not likely in the 
          short term. Anything that PCs and NPCs have in common is a real bear, 
          as I hope you can imagine.&quot; </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Scott Hartsman followed this up recently with a breakthrough from the 
        EQ Live Team:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>...Each copy of a DoT takes up its own slot, due to duration, 
          focus, and damage credit differences. </p>
          <p>We definitely know the effect that would have on DoT casters on 
          raids. (Between Rowyl and Jahaar and the boards -- I get it. I swear. 
          ;) </p>
          <p>However, after some massive late night rewriting, we have an answer 
          to the 15 slot limit for NPCs. We should be able to extend it out at 
          least a little now. </p>
          <p>We'll have to see how far we can take it, though - adding a pile of 
          new slots to every NPC in the game could have some pretty bad side 
          effects that we'll be monitoring and tuning on test...</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This means that it will now not only be possible to stack multiple 
        DoT spells on NPC's, but you will be able to do enough of them that it 
        really will make a significant improvement to the damage output of DoT 
        specializing classes such as Necromancers, Shamans and Druids.</p>

        <p>Hi all,<br>
        <br>
        Thought you'd be interested to know that we're adding in Luclin ports 
        and putting them on Test server this weekend. These spells will be 
        available to both druids and wizards as convenient vendor sold scrolls.
        <br>
        <br>
        We've added a Nexus port for druids, and ports to Dawnshroud, Twilight 
        Sea, and Grimling Forest for wizards and druids. This should help cut 
        the travel time to the remote areas of Luclin, and it's something that a 
        lot of players have been asking for.<br>
        <br>
        Take care,<br>

        <td>From EQLIVE:<p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">Hi all. I just 
        wanted to bring to you a comment from Rich about the way items affect 
        mana and the ‘mana cap’. </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="1">quote:</font> </p>
          <hr>
          <p>Hi, </p>
          <p>The mana cap has been a big topic lately, so I'd like to take a 
          minute to address it. Mana caps have been in EverQuest since the game 
          was released. They haven't been changed, made more restrictive, or 
          added at a later date in order to keep casters down. The mana cap as 
          it is now has been there since you created your character, and only 
          recently become a topic of concern for players. </p>
          <p>Most things in EverQuest have a point of diminishing returns - a 
          point where adding more of a resource yields little or no improvement. 
          This is most obvious in your basic stats, where you can easily see 
          that after your strength score hits 255 it does you no good to put on 
          more strength enhancing gear. These kinds of caps aren't intended to 
          cause you distress, and in many ways they can help support a well 
          balanced game system. </p>
          <p>While we have an appreciation for the benefits that stat caps can 
          bring to a system, we're also willing to look at things like this with 
          an objective eye. The mana cap on worn items has been in since 
          release, and hasn't come up before as an issue that players felt 
          overly limited by. With all the attention focused on the cap in recent 
          days, the dev team looked it over and we agree - there's no reason to 
          place an artificial cap on mana enhancing items. </p>
          <p>On test server now, we've changed the rule so that players get full 
          value from all mana increasing worn items. We expect this will go live 
          with the next patch. </p>
          <p>Thanks for bringing your concerns to our attention, </p>

          <p>This change just affects + Mana items. We didn't change the way a 
          players mana is calculated from intelligence or wisdom, and we're 
          happy with how that part of the system works. </p>

        the UI looks for its files. If you load a skin that is missing pieces it

        means is that if you forget to copy a file into the folder for your new 
        skin, the game will use the default file. It also means that if we 
        update the interface and add new files, your existing skins should 
        continue to work, since the UI will look for those files in the default 
        directory. </p>
