<p>There are lots of quests for druids - they are defined by their starting point. There
many more worthless waste of time quests...waste time at your own pace with the errand
ones and all that.</p>

<p><b><font size="3">Rathe Mountains : Solvedi Scimitar and Perserver Staff
Quest</font></b></p>

<div>
  <font size="3">Since the patch, there are now two new quests out of the druid
  circle in Rathe Mountain.<br>
  <br>
  Perserver Staff is given by Tbrinn Ember, and requires Gazhak the Berserker's
  Mithril Plated Girth as well as King Xorbb's Slime Crystal staff.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Solvedi Scimitar : requires Timber the Tiny's Laceless Sandal and Groi
  Gutblade's Lionhide Backpack</font><font size="2">.</font>
</div>

<p><strong>Observer Staff Quest<br>
<br>
</strong>This isn't much of a quest but yield a great item.&nbsp; Kill Borxx
(level 34) in Runnyeye
and loot his lens.&nbsp; Take it to Brona Frugin in Steamfont.&nbsp; Give it to her with
at least indiferent faction.&nbsp; Yields the <a href="weapons.htm">Staff of the Observers</a>
- one of the best 2 handed blunt weapons in game.</p>

<p><b>Testament of Vanear</b> (quick version)</p>

<p>Go to Qeynos and find Moodro in the first section near the monk guild and
bar.&nbsp; Ask him 'what testament of Vanear' - or just give him 2 gold.&nbsp;
He will give you a 2 slot book container. Then start giving him 4 gold until he
gives you a jester card.&nbsp; (took me 200 times+).&nbsp; Give the jest card
back for the first page.&nbsp; Then go to High Hold Pass Smuggler area
(underwater corridor gets you there).&nbsp; Kill Dyllin Starshine (level 15 or
so)&nbsp; Whack him until you
get the other page - NOT the envelope.&nbsp; Combine and wahlaaa!&nbsp; +10 wis
+10 mana off hand book.</p>

<p><strong>Paw of Oppola </strong><br>
9ac, +9 wis +9 agi, +5 mana, -5 cha, -5 sv disease <br>
<br>
Quest - <br>
Kill Vin Moltor - Qeynos Aquaducts <br>
-- Get Severed Paw Container <br>
Kill Princess Mitty - Kerra Isle <br>
-- Primary Copper, Secondary Gold and Silver <br>
Kill Gynok Moltor - Befallen <br>
-- Primary Platinum, Secondary Gold and Copper <br>
Jump in Blackburrow Pond - Silver Ring, Secondary Gold and Copper? <br>
Identify Each Ring (each must have -1 charis attrib). Put in Severed Paw container.
Combine. Walla! <br>
Supposedly you learn about the quest by giving Vin Moltor a pie. <br>
<br>
<big><big>Kaladim</big></big></p>

<p><a href="images/bloodfrg.jpg">Bloodforge Hammer</a> - Go kill TRUMPY IRONTOE in the
Fish Ale Tavern by the docks of North Quenos - be careful!!!&nbsp; Take his head to Byzar
Bloodforge in the Kaladim Castle new the left back (wont show up on track - its in the
first Kaladim zone).&nbsp; If you have a high enough faction that he will talk to you
-(Squad ringers will have no problem - Stormguard faction)&nbsp; He will hand you the
hammer.&nbsp; Don't die getting Trumpy's head (he's a pud - the other guys in the tavern
aren't).&nbsp; I have done it 3 times - just like this.&nbsp; Nothing else needs to be
done.&nbsp; Byzar will NOT tell you about the quest - its buried like 4 quests in for him.
&nbsp;&nbsp; You do not have to do any of his other quests.&nbsp; Both the head and hammer
are lore items.&nbsp; This quest can be completed around level 10 - 19 is better due to
teleports.&nbsp; You need to be at least amiable to Byzar for this to work!!!<br>
Lokey sent the folling:<br>
<font size="3">The main problem is not Thrumpy, or even his&nbsp;buddies, it is
Barstomper. Yes the man outside that is warmly to so many of us will kill you if you try
to hurt Thrumpy. So, how do we calm him down or even take him out?&nbsp; Well, you
remember that spell Harmony that you couldn't figure out when you got it? That's right.
Run near the Fish's ale, even inside if you don't have a friends to get Thrumpy to come
out, cast Harmony, just to chill them all out, and attack Thrumpy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's the
part where I saw how to kill Thrumpy: Well, you could do nothing but melee and have him
down in 2 minutes, or cast SS and have him down in 2 minutes. I prefer SS and Ignite his
little Dwarven butt to oblivion. It's that easy! Go to Kaladim, get the hammer, sell it
for a buttload, rinse and repeat.&nbsp; This should only be done with 19th level teleport
spells as to save time. But you can make the trip once and get yourself a nice
hammer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's the part where I tell you the downside (you knew there would be
one =). Unfortunatly all quest items have been made NO DROP, now what does that mean you
ask? Well, you can't go to Kaladim and have your friend create a new dwarven character to
give the head to him. You'll have to camp a Goblin outpost to get warmly with them.&nbsp;
And that's all there is to this quest.</font></p>

<p><strong><font size="3">Avenger Battleaxe</font></strong></p>
<b>

<p></b>After returning the clockwork remains (Cleaner clockwork quest) to Beno Tenarl in
Kaladim, ask him about the Eye of Stormguard. He will give you a letter to give to the
Jail clerk near the bank of High Pass keep.&nbsp; Of course the prisoner has escaped but
she does give you part of the eye of stormguard, as well as info that &quot;Bronin&quot;
has the other part, the &quot;Emerald Shard&quot;.&nbsp; Bronin Higginsbot is sometimes
found in Rivervale and sometimes near the southern tower in Misty Thicket.&nbsp; When you
ask Bronin about the Emerald shard, he says he will give it to you if you do a small
favor.&nbsp; Apparently a bounty hunter by the name of Slaythe is after him. He says if
you return a piece of his body, he will give you the emerald.&nbsp; Slaythe is beyond the
wall in Misty Thicket.&nbsp; He appears to be a Froglok (around level 21 or so)!&nbsp; He
hops around between the Orc camp and the wall.&nbsp; You may have to talk to Bronin to get
him to spawn.&nbsp; If you defeat him, you get a froglok leg (lore item), a few gold, and
the following faction adjustments:&nbsp; Frogloks of Kurnak gets worse and Sarnak, Swamp
Giants of Kurnak and Iskar get better.&nbsp; When you return the froglok leg to Bronin, he
tells you that he put the emerald shard in one of the highkeep stronboxes... and gives you
a key to give to the bank clerk in highpass hold.&nbsp; The key is labeled H.K.106.
Turning in Slaythe's leg provides a little experience, no money, and the following faction
adjustments:&nbsp; Deeppockets, Circle of Unseen Hands, Coalition of Trade Folk III and
CarsonMcCabe get better and Merchants of River Vale gets worse.&nbsp; When you turn in the
key in highpass bank, you get the emerald shard, about 1 pp in change, some experience,
and the following adjustments: Merchants of High Pass, Highpass Guards and Carson McCabe
all get better.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bronin also says &quot;There is a [second Emerald Shard] which
I hid near Kelethin, you will need it...&quot;&nbsp; Upon further questioning, you find
out that it has been renamed the Gem of Tunare, and is being held by a guild in Kelethin.
&nbsp; In Kelethin, go to the Scouts of Tunare guild and talk to the guild master there.
When asked about the Gem of Tunare, he tells you that it was stolen by Faldor Hendrys. The
only one who knows where Faldor is, is his brother Elmion who went hunting &quot;at the
lake near the Estate&quot;. Well... following this clue brings you to Dagnor's Cauldron
and Elmion at the NPC-camp there. He tells you that his brother is a thief (and only his
half brother btw...) and that he has gone to Qeynos, probably to work for the thieves
guild there.&nbsp; Faldor Hendrys is a rare spawn in north Qeynos, he can be found walking
out the front gate, and along the road to the Qeynos Hills zone sometimes. You need to
kill him to get the gem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Combine the parts and you get the eye of stormguard,
which gives you +5 magic, cold and fire protection.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you give it to Beno, he
gives you a long speach about how wonderful a warrior you are and says he is giving you a
&quot;warrior's true weapon designed by the ancient stormguard hero, Jendl
Mizebrite.&quot;&nbsp; He then will give you the Dwarven Avenger Battle Axe, a very nice
warrior only 2HS weapon.&nbsp; It is likely that you need to have a very high faction with
him to get the axe. </p>

<p><big><big>Sure Fall Glade</big></big></p>

<p>Broken crook quest - kill some hunter gnolls (NOT Black Burrow)&nbsp; out in the
hills...find 2 pieces of a broken staff (upper and lower) and return them to Corrin in
SFG.&nbsp; He wanders around the town near the druid guild area. This will yield you a one
handed magic weapon. This quest can be completed by level 10 if you are lucky and get the
pieces.</p>

<p>Gnasher&nbsp; - go out into the hills and cap Gnasher Furfoot. He is about level
9-11...take his head and note and hand them to the ranger behind the ranger building in
SFG.&nbsp; He will give you the note back...take it to Captain Tillian in the Arena of
South Quenos...he will give you an Amulet of Merit (+5 Charisma). This quest can be
completed by level 12.</p>

<p>The Millers outside of SFG in QH will make armor - talk to them (Baobob first) and ask
them about boots, cloaks, and belts...it take the appropriate hide and cash at the same
time to get your item....This can be done at any level.</p>

<p>There are 5-6 useless quests in SFG if you are so inclined.</p>

<p><big><big>Kelethen</big></big></p>

<p>The wood-elf druid trainer will give you a quest when you hail him. Bring him a : rusty
broad, long, short and bastard sword and he will give you : some XP, 3 gold and a 2hand
blunt worn great staff. Do this quest a few more times and you will receive a tarnished
scimitar.</p>

<p>You can also turn in the Orc Hatchets to one of the Rangers in the ranger guild for
usually a few weapons - very worthwhile for a young druid.&nbsp; (thanks for the update
Forebian)</p>

<p>Many useless quests here.</p>

<p><big><big>Rivervale</big></big></p>

<p>Squad Ring : Visit the castle like building in town. Walk up to Marshal Ghobber and
tell him that you are new to his squad. He will send you to report to Budo in Misty
Thicket. Budo can be found in the tower on the left of the entrance to the wall. Budo will
inform you that you can return deathfist slashed belts to him(for a nice faction
adjustment) and runneye(goblin) warbeads to Sheriff Roglio in town. After many(and I mean
a bunch) of battles here you can return to Marshal Ghobber and ask him if you are part of
the wall. If you have killed enough then he will reward you with a shiny new Squad Ring.
&nbsp; This can be completed at any time - usually 12 to 16 for enough faction points.</p>

Shakey's Stuffing</p>

<p><strong>USE THE FORGE RIGHT BY THE DRUID FARM AND YOU DON'T NEED SMITHING
SKILL.&nbsp; HOWEVER YOU CAN FAIL WITH NO SKILL OR MASTER SKILL&nbsp; - YOU ARE
WARNED!</strong></p>

<p>First off... the quest details wont be given to you by Reebo if you aren't 4-14 levels.
This does not mean you cant do the quest. Simply follow my instructions and it will work
fine.<br>
<br>
Ok the quest starts at Rivervale in the Druid Farm. (Love that place)<br>
Go here and Hail Shakey the Scarecrow. Ask Reebo what is wrong with Shakey. He will tell
you Shakey needs stuffing and a head, but as I mentioned, you really dont need to chat
with reebo anymore to proceed with the<br>
quest.<br>
<br>
Go to West Karana. There where the Scarecrows spawn you will find the Miller farm. The
Millers occasionally drop hay or even sell it. You need one hay to continue the quest.
Usually you can follow em around and get some hay but if your in a hurry like I always am
then you can auction to buy some hay from ppl in the area. Someone almost always has some.<br>
<br>
After you have obtained the hay go speak with Priestess Jahnda in the Temple of Life in
Qeynos. Tell here, &quot;I need the blessed oil for Estle&quot;. She will direct you to
another priest who's name has slipped my mind. This priest gives the oil out. Ok so now
you have the hay and the Blessed oil.<br>
<br>
Make sure ya have 66gold and head to the Ferrott. Might wanna use invis on this one
depending on your level. Look around the Cazic-Thule Temple entrance for an NPC lizardman
named Roror. Hail him then tell him, &quot;bless my hay&quot;. Give him the 66gold and the
hay and he will return to you some cursed hay and some experience back.<br>
<br>
Now finally go back to Rivervale, in the Druid farm is a forge. Put the cursed hay and the
blessed oil into the forge and combine it. You should get some Writhing Hay. (It looks
like a pouch, ?!?) Ok give the writhing pouch...er hay to Shakey the Scarecrow and walla!
You either get a neato magic weapon or a real nice magic belt for halflings. Repeat the
quest as many times as you like to get both. Or more for a nice profit. The stats for each
are Below.<br>
