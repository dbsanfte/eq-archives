<h1>Charissa&#146;s Guide to Foraged Food</h1>

<p class="MsoNormal">Self-sufficiency is the hallmark of the Druid class, and
their ability to Forage food and water is one of the best, and often
overlooked, abilities of the class.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
share this ability with Rangers and Bards, and all Wood Elves to some
degree.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But only those who Master the
skill will experience the great variety that the lands of Norrath have to
offer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Through my somewhat limited
travels, I have accumulated this knowledge which I now pass on to others who
are working toward mastering the ability to Forage&#133; may it serve you well.</p>

<h2><!--mstheme--><font color="#006633">Basic Foraging<!--mstheme--></font></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">There are several items that can be found in any area at any
level of skill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Berries, Fruit, Roots,
Vegetables and Rabbit Meat can be found all across Norrath, even in dungeons and
far removed, seemingly desolate areas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It seems that no matter where one travels, you will find some form of
plant and animal life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any of these
items can be consumed as food, and some of them are useful as ingredients for
Brewing and Cooking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Additionally, water, while more difficult to forage, can be
found almost anywhere.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Until you begin
to improve your foraging skill beyond it&#146;s natural level, water will be hard to
come by and you may need to augment your supplies with those from
merchants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For some reason, this water
is not usable for crafts such as Smithing and Pottery.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Lastly, foraging can also yield Fishing Grubs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Fishing is another excellent method of
obtaining food.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With free bait, fishing
can be a bit profitable if one is so inclined. <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>Also, of particular interest to Druids, fishing can yield fish
scales, which are a component for our Enduring Breath spell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<h2><!--mstheme--><font color="#006633">Advanced Foraging<!--mstheme--></font></h2>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#996600">Faydwer<!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal">The lands of Faydwer will yield some very distinct foods to
the Master Forager, but they can be difficult to find.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Throughout the forest of Greater Faydark one will find my
personal favorite, Cinnamon Sticks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
may be difficult to find these, as they are also a favorite of the Faeries and
Pixies, which inhabit the area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The wilder stretches of Lesser Faydark have the Sylvan
Berries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is thought that this plant
developed as a result of the magical influences of the Faeries and Brownies
living in the area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Whatever their
origin, these berries will offer you a bit of variety from the normal Norrathian
fruit.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The hot springs of Steamfont are an excellent source of pure
water, known as Steamfont Spring Water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But the water is difficult and sometimes dangerous to collect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Be careful that you select a spring away
from any potential contamination.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It is ironic that the very thing, which troubles the
Dwarves, can also yield us an additional food source.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Aviak Eggs can be found here wherever the Aviaks nest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I leave it to the individual to weigh the
moral implications of harvesting such items, let alone whether they are to your
taste.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Even the rocky environment of Dagnor&#146;s Cauldron has
sustenance to offer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Cauldron Prawns
are an unusual shellfish uniquely adapted to the harsh water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They have a distinctive taste that may
appeal to some, and go quite well with traditional fish fillets.</p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#996600">Antonica<!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal">This largest continent of Norrath, Antonica has a dizzying
array of food to be found.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Nektulos Forest is a dangerous place for the followers
of Tunare or Karana.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But even here,
beneath the evil eye of Innoruuk, life adapts and flourishes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The eerie glow of this forest is due, in
fact, to the Glow Lichen, which grows on the trunks of many trees.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This lichen, surprisingly, is edible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One should not eat or use this for at least
one day after it has been taken from a tree.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The roots of the plant have a mild sedative which will become harmless
as the roots wither and dry out.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Lavatorm Mountains are another desolate area where life
still struggles to survive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the
various cracks and breaks in the rock, one may find small patches of Ashweed
growing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The heat of the lava pools is
too much for the delicate plant however and is rarely found close to them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">There is little water in the deserts of North Ro, but what
little that falls is soaked up by the local Cactuses.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>If one breaks open one of these sturdy plants, at the core you
will find Cactus Pulp, which is both food and liquid, and is an excellent tool
for surviving this sandy, heat blasted area.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Oasis of Marr is not, in actuality, an oasis. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The water here is quite salty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The shores of the oasis are actually a
hardened salt flat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A small bag of Sea
Salt can easily be collected here and used to season almost any food.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Southern Ro is where the desert finally begins to give way
to greener forms of life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The heat
here, however, still takes its toll, and the trees produce the hard, sharp
tasting Ro Dates.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">While quite dangerous, life abounds in the Innothule
swamp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On the trunks of the trees, near
the water line in shaded areas, one can find the Speckled Toadstool.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Care should be taken with this item, as
great concentrations of the toadstool can affect concentration and clear
thinking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Griffons forever trouble the Commonlands west of
Freeport.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If one is so inclined,
Griffon Eggs can be found in the various rocky outcroppings where these
creatures nest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Raiding these nests can
be very dangerous and should not be undertaken lightly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Western Commonlands are home to a food much easier to
collect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Plains roots can be found
throughout the area, and can add a distinctive taste to any meal.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Recently, Kithicor forest has been over run with
Undead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This has drastically reduced
the supply of Wild Radishes throughout Norrath.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It is recommended that one only attempt to harvest this food
during daylight hours.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Misty Thicket, like the Western Commonlands, is home to an
easily harvested root, Black Root.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
root, I hear, is also ground up and added to the tobacco that Halflings are
known to use in their pipes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
supposedly adds a very soothing taste and aroma and is considered a
delicacy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is unknown what the effect
of burning higher concentrations of the powder might be.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A surprise for foraging can be found in the Beholder&#146;s Maze
area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Gorge Moss grows on the walls of
this dangerous area and may appeal to the tastes of some.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The plains of Karana are rich in life, and foraging can be
quite successful in these areas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Eastern Karana is home to my second personal favorite item, Tea
Leaves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A cup of Karana Tea and a
Cinnamon Stick is the perfect combination!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In North Karana grows the fabled Wild Cabbage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is thought that this item will grant some
short-term luck to those who carry or consume it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I have been unable to verify these rumors, but not for lack of
trying.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Western Karana is a highly cultivated area, primarily by the
Miller family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The respected Miller
Carrot can be found here, but the Millers have asked that you only harvest the
wild variety.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They must live off their
fields and ask that you not harvest the fruits of their labors.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">There is an item in South Karana that is named for the
Centaurs that inhabit the area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Thunderhoof Mushroom is found primarily in the northeastern area, but has been
found throughout the area in small numbers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Most of the Lake Rathe area is, of course, water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But on the few grassy inlets in the area,
one can find the tart Rathe Berries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They are quite flavorful and are also a favorite food of the Aviaks it
seems.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In another example of give and take, the Eggs of the
Basilisks, which trouble the Rathe Mountains can be gathered from the rocky
caves the occupy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Great care must be
taken in preparing these eggs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They are
not to be eaten raw!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In their natural
form they will make someone quite ill, and can even kill children or elderly
people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They must be thoroughly cooked
to be edible.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Alligator Eggs of the Feerrott are a much safer
food.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One must be prepared to dodge
Ogres and alligators alike, however, while harvesting them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The strangest item I was able to locate was the Surefall Sap
in the Hills of Qeynos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not
drinkable in its natural state, and diluting it to do so seems rather
pointless.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It may be best suited to use
as a seasoning or topping for other foods.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is rumored that the Surefall Sap is somehow used to make the highly
controversial Blackburrow Stout.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The cold inhospitable stretches of the Everfrost Peaks is a
difficult place for things to survive, but survive they do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you dig beyond the snow and deep into the
hard earth, you will find the uncommon Frost Turnip.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>While a bit bland and tough, it is still edible, and is quite
enjoyable when steamed and seasoned slightly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#996600">Odus<!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal">Odus is a small area, and as such has only one unique item
that I could locate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The forests of
Toxxulia have a native tree which will yield the small Caynar Nut.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is quite easy to fill a small bag with
these nuts from a single tree.<![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#996600">The Oceans<!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;There are two island areas, which can provide items to a
forager.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;The Ocean of Tears is home to the fruit known as the Marr
Cherry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While these can be found wild
on many islands in the area, the Sisters of Erollisi are known to actively
cultivate this fruit for their own consumption.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;Erud&#146;s Crossing, between Qeynos and Erudin, is home to only
a single island.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But on the shores of
this island one can harvest Seahorse Roe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>While possessing a strong odor, these water born eggs are quite tasty
when properly preserved and prepared.<![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-tab-count:
