<h2><!--mstheme--><font color="#006633">Duffer's Young Druid Guide<!--mstheme--></font></h2>
</center>Greetings, and well met. I'm Duffer, and I'd like to share with you a
few things that you can do if you're just starting out as a young druid.
Following this guide should allow you to get to L19 pretty darn fast (2-4 days
/play time).
<p>Now, I'm not (yet!) an old, wise, and experienced druid. In a previous life I
attained the 16th circle before moving to another plane of existence, and I've
just now hit L19, which has been my primary goal for being a druid in the first
place: teleportation!
<p>This is also from the perspective of a Halfling druid. I'm certain you can do
the same as a wood elf, half elf, or human, but I'm not familiar with the newbie
zones (especially on Faydwer, so use with discretion).
<p>Finally, these ideas are not all my own. I've read lots of different druid
sites and tips, etc. So if this sounds suspiciously similar to something else
you've read, I probably read and took to heart the same thing.
<p>Get on with it you say? Very well, here goes.
<p>&nbsp;
<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#996600">Babe in the woods (1-4)<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p>Your only goal is to level as fast as your little (or long) legs will let
you. Kill everything that cons white or blue, but stick with white. Other sites
have good newbie guides, my only advice is don't worry about dying. Who cares?
Take yellows if you think you can handle them (watch out for those spiderlings
until level 3-4), the experience is well worth it. These levels should go FAST.
<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#996600">A little youngling (5-8)<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
You have a little bit better spell now (Burst of Fire), and in the thicket at
least, it's time to move beyond the wall. Giant rats are great exp for a L4-5
person, I killed them whenever they conned blue to me even as a L6. You should
also be able to take out black bears (watch out for the Young Kodiaks!),
especially if you use snare and panic animal to good effect. Leveling is slower,
but you should still go pretty fast. Toward the end here, you should be taking
on gobs. Use your harmony, you can pull an entire camp of three while the other
classes have to worry about getting mobbed.
<p>You also need to start hunting the gobs for the weapons and armor. You'll
need to get several of your L9 spells right off the bat, although you can wait
on some of the others. The ones I used all the time (in order) were: Ignite,
Light Heal, Shield of thistles, Thistlecoat, Strength. The last two are not all
that necessary, but nice. Save the rest for when you have money (more on that in
a bit).
<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#996600">Adolescent (9-14)<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
At level 9 you get your first &quot;nice&quot; damage spell, ignite. Ignite does
33 damage to start, which is a very nice upgrade. Even though the ratio of
damage/mana isn't all that great, it's nice to be able to blast things out of existence. This will allow you to start taking on some of the larger thicket
inhabitants: Giant Spiders, wasps, and young kodies (in that order, eg 9, 10,
11). My strategy was brute force and simple:
<p>Target : Snare : Turn and run : Blast : run : Blast ...
<p>Once you've blasted the target down to 1/4 or 1/3 of it's hit points, turn
and melee. This serves two purposes: one you won't have enough mana to totally
blast the good exp creatures out of existence, and two you need to at least make
a semblance of keeping your melee skills up.
<p>Personally I was able to have both 1hb and 1hs in the mid forties by 12th
level or so, using this strategy. However, my 2hb suffered, and I had to really
work to get 2hb up to the 60 or so mark which is where it still sits since I've
turned back to practicing the other skills. I have found it to be impossible to
keep all three skills maxed at each level. I simply don't (and can't) melee well
enough.
<p>At level 10, I faced a choice. There are plenty of things in the thicket that
will give you good experience up until L14 (bind and SOW!), but it starts
getting a little thin toward the upper end, and you really will most likely wind
up either &quot;blast kiting&quot; yks until you're bored stiff, or camping the
orcs in the corner, which is also pretty darn boring, and there's typically a
lot of people there.
<p>Instead, I decided that it was time to set out for a bit of an adventure.
Since my strategy involved experience more than loot, I was particularly poor,
but since I'd killed a lot of goblins, my Stormguard faction was fairly high. I
decided to do the Bloodforge hammer quest and get myself a magic weapon.
<p>So, purchase camo (if you don't already have it) and head west to Qeynos.
There are enough descriptions of the quest that I'm not going to go into it
here. Suffice to say, if you're daring, don't bother getting yourself bound in
Qeynos, because if you kill Trumpy you can gate back to Rivervale and be more
than halfway to Freeport. If you're paranoid like me, get yourself bound in
Qeynos and plan on running to Freeport. Anyway, kill Trumpy and get his head.
<p>In retrospect, there may be a couple of other things you might want to do
while you're in or around Qeynos. First, if you've been smart and lucky, you'll
have saved yourself one each of a low, medium, and high quality bear pelt (that
is, if you don't mind hunting animals). If you go to the entrance of Surefall
glade and talk to Chanda Miller, she'll happily make you a belt and boots. Just
tell her [Baobob sent me]. However, my faction wasn't high enough for her to
make me a cloak, but I was able to pay a young local an extra 5 gold to have the
cloak made. Requires a bit of trust, but I didn't have a problem.
<p>Second, you may want to try and nab Gnasher Furgutt while you're here. If you
turn Gnasher's head and note into a guy in Surefall (I don't remember the name),
and then take the note that he gives you to Captn. Tillian in Qeynos, you can
get a medallion that has a +5 to charisma. Handy for those of us who are
charismatically challenged (50 for me!). I still haven't done this yet, but
Gnasher is supposed to be about L10, so it should be doable.
<p>With Trumpy's head in a sack, and optionally sporting a new cape, belt,
boots, and medallion, head off for Freeport. Personally I always run through the
gorge and RV, it gives me a chance to stop off at the guild if I've saved enough
money for another spell, plus I've just never figured Highpass Hold out. Maybe
in a few more levels. In Freeport, hop on the boat, make your way to Kaladim,
and turn in Trumpy's head to Byar Bloodforge for your brand spanking new Bloodforge
hammer.
<p>Get yourself bound in Kaladim, and make sure that you have lots and lots of
bags, boxes, etc, because you're about to hit (young) loot city.
<p>Head back to the docks, and get on the boat. Now, not too long after the boat
zones into the Ocean of Tears, you'll pass some rocks. Get off on the first
rocks. There are five aqua goblins here. Three of them can be pulled
individually, the other two require harmony, but if I was alone here, I found
that I typically could only keep up with the spawn rate of two of these goblins.
These gobs are nice for two reasons. First, there typically aren't that many
people around (or any... in my experience I had to share the spawn with two
people... one on a regular basis, and one dwarf once who had accidentally fallen
off the boat). Second, every single goblin carries a bow worth 2g (slightly less
with my charisma). Take the gobs until you can barely move/fight from the
weight, gate back to Kaladim to sell, and repeat until you hit level 12 or you
get really really bored!
<p>Make sure to snare the gobs when they get to 1/3 to 1/2 health. They turn and
run easily, and nothing sucks worse than trying to get in position to swing
underwater. If they turn and stand there, you can whack them in the back all day
(this was where my weapon skills really progressed ... lots of melee). My
strategy was to snare, target self, thistle shield, target gob, and
melee/ignite. I could sometimes pull with an ignite or get an ignite off after
the snare, but be careful. You want the thistle shield up, and it does NO GOOD
to cast ignite on them when you're out of the water and they're in it. If one
gets away, just sit down and meditate. I never had one pull a friend in the time
that I hunted here.
<p>For selling, prices suck in Kaladim, but they can be helped somewhat if
you've gotten your charisma up, and if you sneak up to a merchant (of the
opposite sex, seems to help!) to sell. Make sure they con indifferent. (You have
been practicing all your skills all along, right?).
<p>By L11 the gobs here are low blues/high greens, so while you can continue to
12 here (I got close), you could make the argument to just take off once you hit
L11. The gobs'd probably be great experience solo or in a group of 2 for L8-9
characters. But that's a little young to get the Bloodforge, which is critical
for the next stage of your life.
<p>Wisps. Until you hit L14, head to the West Commonlands around the tollbooth,
and get ready to smack some wisps. Since you have a magical weapon and spells,
you're well situated. You're doing this now because these are the best levels
for experience AND loot from wisps. Your goal: Greater Lightstones. Players buy
GLs for 8pp each (exercise to the reader to figure out why!), and you can
typically sell normal lightstones for 1pp each (although they're in less
demand... just sell in RV, if you can't find a PC who wants them). Just destroy
the Burned Out Lightstones, they are worthless. If you're lucky, you can make
100-150pp pretty easily here in a couple of levels. This was (and still is) the
best loot I've found. The fact that you can hunt them while getting experience
is just gravy, because you'll be trying to snag them along with other, higher
level characters who just need the loot.
<p>Here are some hints for fighting wisps:

  <!--msthemelist--><tr><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="_themes/nature/anabull1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td><td valign="top" width="100%"><!--mstheme--><font face="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">I found it handy to sit near the spawn spots in treeform, since your hit points
    regenerate so much faster, I was able to rely more on melee and
    less on mana dumps, which let me fight more wisps, more often. Just be wary
    of being near a spawn spot, because three wisps will take you out like
    yesterday's trash, and be careful of other PC's coming over to take that
    nice little unoccupied wisp sitting in front of the tree. I had to explain
    myself a couple of times when a caster pulled a wisp from me with a big
    spell, and I dumped my mana into it to make sure I got the kill. I also got
    lots of laughs. Anyone who comes up close will get messages about the wisp
    getting hit, so it's mostly the casting classes that get a little worked up.
    But you can loot in treeform too, so there's no need to move. As a handy
    side effect, you don't have to worry about the griffs or hill giants,
    either. So when everyone else scatters, it's dinner time! Get as many as
    possible.<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--></td></tr>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#996600">Teenager (14-16)<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
Yippee! SOW! Bask in your glory. Take your wisp money and buy all the rest of
your spells. I cleaned up all the empty slots that I hadn't purchased from the
earlier levels, spotted a friend 30pp to practice a trade that I want to take
advantage of later, and bought myself a couple of better pieces of armor
(snakeskin jerkin, gloves, etc). I'm still (even at L19) mostly in patchwork. I
just haven't taken the time to upgrade! But, that's what teleport is for (IMHO).
I also picked up a combine scimitar to replace my old tarnished one. It was kind of
expensive (35pp), but I wanted a faster weapon to go back and practice my
1hs with.
<p>OK, another spell you get at L14 is Expulse Summoned. What does this mean? It
means there's only one place for you! Lavastorm. Get yourself a couple of stacks
of batwings (typically you can purchase from vendors around newbie areas, or
from Newbies themselves) for levitate, and he thee to Lavastorm. Make sure to
camo yourself through the Nektulos forest, because the guards there don't want
to see your scruffy face. Lavastorm is filled to the brim with elementals. And
your new spell does 87 or so damage to elementals. Very, very nice. What this
means is that you need to go back to your snare, run, burn trick. The down time
is considerable, yes, but you'll be solo-ing yellows all the way to L17. These
levels should go FAST. If you want, you can group with another druid for even
quicker take downs, but it's not really necessary. I don't see much point to
grouping with anyone other than a druid in Lavastorm. We rule the zone at this
level.
<p>A couple of suggestions:

    swarm. Swarm will come in handy in the next phase of your existence, never

<!--msthemelist--></table><!--mstheme--><font face="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">
<p>At level 16 you'll have to hunt for yellow elementals, but most of the lava
crawlers will still be white or yellow. I typically didn't waste my time on a
blue unless I'd run around for a while without finding a yellow. The experience
gain from yellows solo is nothing short of remarkable. Almost makes you want to
play a necromancer. :)
<p>Level 17 pretty much ends the parade here. Almost everything will be blue,
and experience starts crawling again. You can probably stay here for one more
level, but I was ready for a change of pace at this point.
<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#996600">Young Adult (17-18)<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
You have to find someplace with more whites and higher level blues. For me, this
was Eastern Karana. There are lots of Chasm Crawlers and Gorge Hounds that con
anywhere from blue to yellow to a L17. However, you must develop a new strategy
to hunt here. Especially if you're going to solo.
<p>Personally, I had some great groups here, typically just a ranger and myself
for a constant stream of blues. Or, if you find a third person, you can start to
take crag spiders, which should be yellow and red at L17. I grouped successfully
with a ranger/bard and ranger/enchanter... I'm sure a second melee class would
also be nice, but the bard made for a rapid pace, since I wasn't using too much
mana. Strategy (for both blues and crags) was to target the puller (Rangers are
great -- plug plug) as he shouts incoming, and thistle shield as soon as you
can. Then /assist, cast swarm, and wade into melee. I only used ignite when we
needed to take something down fast, either because the Ranger was getting hit
hard, or because we had somehow pulled two critters. For blues, I would sit down
and meditate for the last 1/3-1/2 of the fight... my mana was more of a limiting
factor than the tanks hit points. And I could med more than it would take to
heal the damage he would take at the end of the fight. This will help your
experience, be a lot less boring than solo, and also help to up your melee
skills, since you'll often be beating on yellows/reds if you're pulling crags.
<p>Solo, it's time for a new strategy. Charm! Just be sure to always have a SOW
that will *not* wear out, and always warn people if you're going to run to the
bridge. Target a blue (crawlers make great pets, and seem to last longer than
hounds in my experience), and immediately attack another blue. For the first
one, burn as much as is reasonable, the goal is to get the critter down ASAP,
let your pet take some damage, but try and make sure it has enough life to take
out one more critter. I typically swarm the blue I want to attack, then type (or
hotkey) &quot;/pet attack&quot;. Sit and med for the first half of the battle
(if your pet is going to turn, it'll do it pretty early, so you might as well
get a smidge more mana. If your pet stays charmed and the target is at about
half health, get up and chuck your ignites. You want the experience!
<p>As soon as the target dies, target another blue and send your pet off. Swarm
and then target *your pet*, get fairly close, and sit down and meditate. Watch
your pet's health bar. When it gets down to about 1/3, you need to get in there
and take some hits. The goal is to have the second blue drop with your pet's
health bar barely visible (or at least at about 20% or so). You'll often have
your pet turn at this point, so don't be afraid to zone if you've got two on
you. If you get the second one down, take your wounded pet off to a corner (near
bridge or gorge zone), and sit down to med for real. Keep your pet targeted so
you can keep an eye on its health bar. (it's especially nice if it is poisoned,
so the health bar stay's low). Meditate until the pet turns on you, and then get
up and whack it. It doesn't have much health, and you've just got your third
blue critter in 5 minutes and one mana bar. Exp is GREAT. Better than grouping,
in my experience, but groups are more fun. Exp can also suck when you've just
zoned for the third time without getting off a single successful kill.
<p>Some final hints:

    target your pet first, finish it off, and then finish off the first guy, but
    I've never successfully done this to test. I consider this to be a BUG and
    I've /bug'ged it several times. Do so yourself. It's nuts when you've almost
    got it dead, one more ignite finishes it off, and then it vanishes in a puff
    of smoke.

<p>The spells I had memorized from L17 and L18 were:
<p>&nbsp;
<ol>

  <li>Ignite
  <li>Snare
  <li>Thistle Shield
  <li>Panic Animal
  <li>Befriend Animal

<p>Panic animal is surprisingly effective. If you find that you're facing one
beast, with only a bubble or two of mana, try to get off a panic animal (fast
cast) when he misses. Then snare, swarm, and follow him around whacking on him.
When he turns, panic again. Panic takes hardly any mana, and when he's running,
he's taking the full damage of your DOT. If you just need that little smidge of
extra mana, panic, snare, and med while he runs away for a bit. He'll be back,
but then you'll have enough mana for a final ignite.
<p>There you go. Do levels 17 and 18 this way and you'll be laughing all the way
