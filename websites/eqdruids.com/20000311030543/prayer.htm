        I Brennos Oakkeepp,<br>
        *raises head to the sky, stretches his arms up to the heavens*<br>
        Leader of the Keepers of Oak and The Rathe Druid Council send out this
        prayer.<br>
        I call today on the Strength of Karanas and the compassion of Tunare.<br>
        As Druids we are blessed with many powers and we thank thee for making
        us<br>
        so capable as the keepers of the balance of nature. There are some
        issues<br>
        I have been assigned with to pray to you for. It is believed my powers<br>
        as a leader will gain greater favor and thus hopefully we shall see some<br>
        improvements. I am but a humble woodsman, but others don't see me that<br>
        way and so I pray to you know to please hear our requests and know that<br>
        they may not be my requests, but the druid majority felt they were
        issues<br>
        needing divine attention. As your devote follower and a capable, yet
        humble<br>
        woodsman, I lend myself to help thee in anyway to resolve these
        problems.<br>
        <br>
        We have several spells which are supposed to be improvements on others,<br>
        yet they show know ability to be better in anyway. These would be the
        upgrades<br>
        to snare, befriend animal and grasping root line of powers. Because of
        this<br>
        imbalance we have spells many wise druids refuse to purchase and
        inscribe. It<br>
        is felt that the gods are so busy with other issues, that these are
        being<br>
        overlooked. It might be better to remove them from the world than to
        taunt<br>
        us with the promise of improvement.<br>
        <br>
        At this time I shall pray about our strength as a class. I know some
        have<br>
        sinned greatly and taken the lives of the humanoid guards, thus making
        us<br>
        all incur your wrath and lose our strength in our Damage over Time
        spells.<br>
        However, as a keeper of balance and a spokesman for all responsible
        Druids,<br>
        I must lodge a request to reinstate this power. Of the hundreds of
        Druids<br>
        that attend the Druid Council, the majority still feel, even after
        emotions<br>
        have calmed, that this power should not have been tampered with, and the<br>
        punishment too severe across the whole class just to slow down those
        that<br>
        choose the path of the Unkempt Druids (power gamers). We are certain
        that<br>
        with all thy powers, there must be a better solution to slowing the<br>
        progress of the few, without crippling the many.<br>
        <br>
        And finally I would like to state that I see great wisdom in not giving
        us<br>
        a pet spell as we are the keepers of balance and this would hurt that<br>
        balance. However, we pray to you now to allow those animals that we<br>
        befriend to journey on their way when our spell runs out, and not attack
        us.<br>
        Mayhaps the animal would make the decision to leave or attack based on
        how<br>
        much of it's health it had left. If a Druid had healed and buffed it, or<br>
        nay used it as a battle partner at all, it would go on it's way, not<br>
        realizing anything had been done, however, if it took damage and had not<br>
        been healed, then it's anger and pain would be turned on the Druid.
        Although<br>
        I have explained to my brethren that part of our job is to help curb the<br>
        overpopulation of predator animals and we shouldn't feel badly about
        culling<br>
        the herds a bit, it still leaves us empty to kill one we have
        befriended. I<br>
        know of only a few druids who use our befriend line of spells, and even
        then<br>
        as a novelty, not a legitimate battle tactic. It has been suggested that<br>
        mayhaps taming animals be a trainable skill for Druids as opposed to a
        spell.<br>
        This also might be a solution and a way to be sure our &quot;pets&quot;
        are not too<br>
        powerful as we would only be able to tame certain leveled creatures.<br>
        <br>
        The Druid Council tries desperately to form some sense of community to<br>
        Norrath. The economy is in desperate need of attention, which although<br>
        would be unpopular, would be fixed by making items repairable, and
        breakable.<br>
        Suddenly people would have a need for each other and items that had been<br>
        camped and handed out across Norrath, and thus lost their worth, such as<br>
        the Runed Totem Staff, would again be worth something, as would the
        skills<br>
        of tailors and blacksmiths.<br>
        <br>
        There are, of course other issues which we shall leave for now, but our
        main<br>
        one is the feeling that we are not the favored children of Tunare or
        Karanas,<br>
        but instead are the siblings of misbehaving children, being punished
        along<br>
        with them. I am sure the wisdom of Tunare sees through this, as does the<br>
        strength of Karanas and know that the majority of Druids are responsible<br>
        and love and care for our home of Norrath.<br>
        <br>
        As your humble servants we pray to you now, to hear our words and know
        our love<br>
        and respect and please guide us to find our path, balanced once more, by
        your hand,<br>
        and your skills, we shall bring Norrath to a pinnacle of splendor in the
        universe.<br>
        *lowers his head, drops his arms, and kneels with his hands on the moist
        earth<br>
        of Surefall Glade*<br>
        I, you humble servant Brennos, beseech thee to answer our prayers and
        help us.<br>
        By the strength of Heaven,<br>
        Light of Sun,<br>
        Radiance of Moon,<br>
        Splendor of Fire,<br>
        Speed of Lightning,<br>
        Swiftness of Wind,<br>
        Depth of Sea,<br>
        Stability of Earth,<br>
        and<br>
        Firmness of Stone...<br>
        Amen</font><!--mstheme--></font></td>
