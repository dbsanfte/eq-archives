            <p><strong>Head to North Freeport. Go in the sewers
            in the northwestern part of town, a little ways in on
            the inside of a colapsed wall is Bondl Felligan. Give
            the gem to him. </strong></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>You say, 'hail Bondl Felligan'</strong></p>
        <p>Bondl Felligan burps loudly in your face and says,
        'Bah! Leave me be, fool! You have nothin' I want and I
        certainly have nothin' you want.' </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Give Bondl the &quot;tiny gem&quot;.</strong></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Bondl Felligan says 'WOW, thanks! This must be worth a
        fortune! I could drink for a month after sellin' this to
        one of them fool merchants. I'm going to see how much I
        can get for it right now! <br>
        Your faction standing with TrueSpirit got better<br>
        You gain party experience!! </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Next wait for him to move, follow him back
            out of the sewers onto the land outside, there he
            will stop and speak to you. </strong></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Bondl Felligan says 'What!? You don't approve of me
        buyin' some drinks with this gem? Who the heck are you to
        offer me a gift and order me what to do with it? Is this
        some kinda conditional kindness? Well? Are you gonna let
        me buy some booze with this or not? </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'You can buy booze.'</strong></p>
        <p>Bondl Felligan suddenly becomes completely sober and
        says, 'Very well, shaman, please come with me.' </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>After this you can follow him to the Jade
            Tiger's Den or just go there yourself. Head up to the
            third floor, middle room and go inside. There you'll
            find a greater spirit waiting. </strong></p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>NOTE: After giving him the gem once,
            simply going up to him and saying &quot;You can buy
            booze&quot; at anytime will cause the spirit to spawn
            in the room. No need to travel back to Ocean of
            Tears, Field of Bones, Rathe Mountains or
            Butcherblock Mountains to initiate the quest again</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>CAUTION: As backwards as it may sound,
            there are reports that repeating steps of the Quest
            may actually &quot;over-inflate&quot; your True
            Spirit faction and make later parts of the Quest
            &quot;untriggerable&quot;.</strong></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Once you arrive at the Jade Tiger's Den . . . </strong></p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'Hail a greater spirit'</strong></p>
        <p>a greater spirit says 'Greetings, shaman. Tell me, do
        you follow [<strong>Justice</strong>], [<strong>War</strong>],
        [<strong>Fear</strong>], or [<strong>Hate</strong>]? </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Answer appropriately depending upon
            whether you are:<br>
            Barbarian [Justice],<br>
            Ogre [War],<br>
            Iksar [Fear], or<br>
            Troll [Hate].</strong></p>
            <p><strong>What follows is the Barbarian response . .
            . </strong></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>You say, 'I follow justice'</strong></p>
        <p>a greater spirit says 'Ah, a follower of the Tribunal
        from the North you are, then. You would be best served by
        speaking to my brother in the next room. Farewell . </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Go to the other room as instructed by a
            greater spirit. </strong></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>You say, 'Hail a greater spirit'</strong></p>
        <p>a greater spirit says 'It is good to see you. We're
        glad you trusted in our brother and did what was asked
        regardless of Bondl's intentions. This fills us with joy,
        as the [<strong>true spirits</strong>] work in ways most
        people would not understand and [<strong>trust</strong>]
        is the first lesson of the [<strong>Heyokah</strong>]. </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'What true spirits?'</strong></p>
        <p>a greater spirit says 'As a shaman, spirits are known
        to you. They aid you if you pay them homage and respect
        the world around you. They also will bend to your will if
        you are powerful enough. We are a part of the entire
        universe and we exist because people believe and feel us.
        However [<strong>very few</strong>] know us in this form.
        To mortals we are but ideas, [<strong>wisps of
        consciousness</strong>] in an expanse of emptiness and as
        difficult to grasp as breath in Everfrost. </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'What trust do you speak of?'</strong></p>
        <p>a greater spirit says 'Trust is the glue of the
        universe. When one trusts others to do their part, it
        allows them to focus on what they must do themselves. The
        trust that others have in us also gives us the confidence
        to do our parts effectively, thus maintaining harmony.
        When one becomes dissatisfied with his part and pursues
        his own desires, this is called greed. And greed destroys
        the glue of the universe. This is why we wished the
        bandits under the grass. </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'What very few?'</strong></p>
        <p>a greater spirit says 'There are only a handful of
        mortals we've judged worthy to be friends and,
        reluctantly, masters. We call them the [<strong>Heyokah</strong>].
        Bondl is one of them and he helps to test those we
        believe might be able to grasp our existence. There are
        many troubles that threaten us and our home. We seek
        those with the wisdom, patience, and might to help us
        ensure the health of the cosmos. Whether you seek balance
        or personal power, this is important to you. </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'What wisps of consciousness?'</strong></p>
        <p>a greater spirit says 'It is difficult for mortals to
        grasp what we are for we are not material that can be
        held or consumed. We are the spirit that drives beings to
        do what beings do. The wolf lives to run and hunt. When
        you ask for his aid, his spirit enters your body and you
        'become' wolf. The ox is the personification of endurance
        and when he enters your body, you do not become an ox,
        you become all that is ox. I myself am the spirit of
        understanding. </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'What heyokah?'</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>The greater spirit should give you the gem
            after you say the above line.</strong></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>a greater spirit says 'The Heyokah are our mortal
        counterparts. Some are our friends who seek to help us in
        whatever goals we deem important. Some seek nothing more
        than to enslave and command us to do their bidding. We
        accept this and often make deals with those we realize
        are powerful enough to accomplish what needs to be done.
        To judge such individuals, we have prepared a test. We
        ask that before we enter into these contracts, the shaman
        walk the [<strong>path of the Heyokah</strong>]. We see
        you may be worthy. Will you walk the path? You will be
        rewarded for your efforts, albeit grudgingly. </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>CAUTION: DO NOT say the following line
            until you receive the gem by saying the above line.
            The next line will cause him to immediately despawn
            but will start the next quest for you. </strong></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>You say, 'I will walk the path of the Heyokah'</strong></p>
        <p>a greater spirit says 'That is good. You will need to
        walk three paths before you can reach that of the
        Heyokah. The paths of patience, wisdom, and might. First,
        you must learn patience. Take this gem and go on a
        pilgrimage to an island in the great water the wasichu
        call Erud's Crossing. The Kerrans there are our allies
        and can show you to our next contact, Ooglyn. Give Ooglyn
        the gem and do what she asks. As you walk the path,
        remember what you've learned about trust. </p>
