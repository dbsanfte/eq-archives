        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Go into City of Mist.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Go across the bridge. </strong></p>
            <p><strong>Open the gate. </strong></p>
            <p><strong>Turn right. </strong></p>
            <p><strong>Go straight forward through 2 arches. </strong></p>
            <p><strong>In the last room you will find a temple
            with a waterfall running down its side. </strong></p>
            <p><strong>Stay in that courtyard of temple, and pull
            skeletons, etc., from the first door you see at the
            base of the temple. </strong></p>
            <p><strong>Open the door. Inside is another door
            directly in front of you, do not open this door, it
            leads to top of temple. Look instead to the right,
            where three skeletons spawn. Pull these skeletons to
            courtyard and kill them. </strong></p>
            <p><strong>Go back into door, head right and ye will
            see a room set below ground level with three phantoms
            in it, standing on a raised dais. Pull and kill these
            phantoms. There are two doors beside the dais, one
            opening to the left and one opening to the right.
            Choose the left door. Inside is a small room with no
            monsters inside, and a small bag on the floor in the
            left corner. Click on the bag, you now have the High
            Scale Icon. Gate out. </strong></p>
            <p><strong>Using Invisibility to Undead potion
            (Unlife Awareness) will get you past the last three
            skeletons and phantoms. They will still scowl at you,
            ready to attack, but it is a bluff. They will NOT be
            able to see you. </strong></p>
            <p><strong>Be warned, however, as the golems of the
            area can see through Invisibility to Undead, and you
            may run across a couple on the way to the temple
            area. </strong></p>
            <p><strong>There were no rogue-locked doors between
            the zone and the High Scale icon.</strong></p>
