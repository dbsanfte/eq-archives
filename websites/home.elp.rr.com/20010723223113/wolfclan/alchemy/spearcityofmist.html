            <p>I heard last night that there was some kind of
            commontion at the castle. Guards were shouting,
            spells went off throughout the halls and many died.
            Some say there was an assassination, some say a band
            of frogloks attacked under the command of a dragon,
            some even say there was some divine intervention. I
            have no idea why any god would strike against Lord
            Rak`Ashirr. He is a paragon fro the cause of
            Cazic-Thule. I hope whatever it was sticks to
            attacking the castle and not my shop though. </p>

            held in honor of the event and the High Scale will be

            <p>The list should all be in order except for the
            swatches of silk. I won't need such a large order in
            this quarter. Her Divinity Drian made it known to me
            that they would not need as many new robes this
            coming season as &quot;none were quite ready to don
            them.&quot; My colleagues have all been confirming
            that the church is buying less and less these days.
            It seems Rak`Ashiir has decided the royal donation to
            be cut. However I'm sure we'll find new customers
            soon and our orders will be back to normal shortly. </p>

            <p>Hear all Tosis! It is with great regret that we

            Our best scouts have begun searching the surrounding
            countries for her trail. The Lord Rak`Ashiir also
            authorized the hire of mercenaries to venture into
            the Froglok Territories to search for traces of the
            Queen. All interested parties should report to the
            royal Quartermaster's office. Fear not citizens, our
            Queen will be found. Wisdom guide us. </p>

            <p>Well it appears our Lord Rak`Ashiir in his
            &quot;wisdom&quot; has cut our church's donation yet
            again. He claims it is to bolster the ranks of our
            garrison as many were wipe out during the Froglok
            incursions. However, I see more and more soldiers
            everyday, more that I ever have. And they are all
            equipped in the best armors the city's smiths can
            craft. This along with the recent replacement of our
            Bishop Screks with that coin grubber Biliaz leads me
            to suspect our King is planning on all but destroying
            our church entirely. I don't understand it, perhaps
            his missing Queen has driven him mad. </p>

            <p>Missed mass again today. This is the third time
            this week now. It is a worthy sacrifice however as I
            was able to attend the Master's National Coin
            exchange class. Perhaps the clergy will change the
            time of their masses, then I'll be able to attend
            regulary. Although with the appointment of the new
            Arch Priest it appears mass may be discontinued
            altogether. I honestly hope so. I could attend many
            more classes as well as spend more time rubbing
            elbows with merchants at the bazaars. I think I'll
            have to miss tomorrow's mass as well. I heard the
            Laughing Leech Guild is taking members again.<br>

        Hmmm...this is interesting. It appears the disappearance
        of the first queen may have caused Rak'Ashiir's faith to
        decline. From there, the first King Rak laid down the
        groundwork for the city's eventual demise. We need to
        learn what happened to the queen. Perhaps bringing this
        knowledge to the King's now cursed form will lift the
        mantle. We've learned that the last lord of Torsis,
        Ghiosk, was a bit of a historian. Find him and see what
        you can learn about the queen. Take what you find to my
        brother here In the jungle beneath the murky waters of a
        pond. <br>
