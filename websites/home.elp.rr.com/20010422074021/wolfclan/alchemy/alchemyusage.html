        Alchemy Potions Do?</font></h3>
        <p align="left">In order to take full advantage of this
        intriguing new aspect to Everquest, a complete
        understanding of exactly what each potion will do is
        crucial.</p>
        <p align="left">When Verant first revamped the old
        alchemy into the new alchemy, many shamans on many
        servers spent untold hours and many thousands of platinum
        discovering its secrets by trial and error. Many potions
        have been discovered, and there are likely others still
        to be discovered. For the time being, we do have quite a
        few potions (51 at last count) to work with. </p>
        <p align="left">The following information will be vital
        in determining which potions you might need, and which
        you do not.</p>

                <p><strong><u>Kilva's Blistering Flesh</u></strong>
                invokes a <font color="#80FF80">Scorching Skin</font>
                damage shield lasting <u>approximately</u> (level
                of the drinker/4). Damage is equivalent to the
                (level of the drinker/4) + 1. Hence, a level 40
                drinker would benefit from an approximate 10
                minute damage shield doing 11 points of damage (
                40 / 4 + 1). At an average price of 17 pp, this
                potion is more popular with higher level drinkers
                due to the increased damage and duration.</p>

                and works instantly. At an average price of 12 pp

                grants you the effects of <font color="#80FF80">Serpent
                Sight</font>, also known as Infravision. A good
                potion for Barbarians, Humans and Erudites that
                have no &quot;night-sight&quot; spells and, to
                many, worth the 18 pp average price per potion to
                keep a few around.</p>

                your armor class by 6 points in the manner of <font
                color="#80FF80">Scale Skin</font> spell and has a
                duration of approximately 27 minutes. A fairly
                worthless potion, you must have a <font
                color="#80FFFF">snakescale</font> in your
                inventory as a component before drinking this
                potion.</p>
                <p><strong><u>Spirit Shield</u></strong> buffs
                your armor class by 18 points in the manner of <font
                color="#80FF80">Shifting Shield</font> spell and
                has a duration of approximately 47 minutes. No
                component is needed, this potion may prove
                moderately useful at an average price of 40 pp.</p>
                <p><strong><u>Stinging Wort</u></strong> grants

                The Strength and Hit Point boosts wear off
                gradually in &quot;<font color="#FFFF80">damage
                over time</font>&quot; fashion over a 6 minute
                period. Another nice potion for melee classes.</p>
                <p><strong><u>Swamp</u></strong> will instantly <font

                Swamp with exactly a 30 second
                &quot;casting&quot; time. A crucial potion for
                non-gating, non-porting, non-evacing classes and
                well worth the pricy 375 pp average cost to
                escape the planes or other high-level deep
                dungeons.</p>
                <p><strong><u>Tamed Mercury</u></strong> bestows <font

                increase your attack speed for approximately 3
                minutes. While a very popular effect for
                melee'ers, a fairly expensive potion at 55 pp
                average price considering the short duration.</p>
                <p><strong><u>Unlife Awareness</u></strong> makes
                you <font color="#80FF80">Invisible to Undead</font>
                creatures. Like most invisible spells, duration
                may fluctuate. Very useful in the areas like
                Lower Guk (dead side), Combine City (Dreadlands),
                Keasora, and elsewhere. Worth the 20 pp average
                price in many instances when you'd like to enter
                or leave an area without agro'ing everything in
                your path.</p>

            <p><strong>TIP: </strong>Whether you need a utility
            potion for some specific mission or raid, or whether
            you just want to keep a few around for emergency
            purposes (the most likely reason), these utility
            potions can give you the edge you need to survive,
            conquer or escape death and the xp loss that death
            conjurs. Ask yourself, &quot;Is it worth a half
            bubble of lost xp to gobble down a potion at the
            right moment?&quot; The answer is academic. A tank
            walking out of the Frenzied room in Guk would find an
            Unlife Awareness potion handy. Being stuck alone deep
            in a dungeon or on the planes after going link dead
            could be disastrous without a gate potion. There are
            a thousand different situations where you may find
            yourself needing a potion.</p>
