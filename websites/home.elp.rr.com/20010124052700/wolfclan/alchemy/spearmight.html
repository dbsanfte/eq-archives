            <p><strong>Head to loc +1250, +300 in Emerald Jungle.
            There you'll find the Sentinel Spirit. </strong></p>
            <p><strong>Hail him and give him the gem you received
            from the wandering spirit. </strong></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Spirit Sentinel says 'Ahh, you live, shaman! I am glad
        the beasts of this jungle haven't torn your body asunder.
        Tell me, do you still walk the path? Are you willing to [<strong>continue
        what you have started</strong>]? <br>
        Your faction standing with TrueSpirit got better</p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'I will continue what i have started'</strong></p>
        <p>Spirit Sentinel says 'This brings happiness to our
        hearts and we are grateful. However, we must ask you to
        walk one more path before you can become a true Heyokah.
        With trust, one can focus on what is important. With
        patience, one can perceive what is harmful. With wisdom,
        one can know what must be done. These, you have learned,
        yet without the might to carry out what must be done, all
        is for naught. Are you [<strong>prepared to walk the path
        of might</strong>]? </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'I am prepared to walk the path of
        might'</strong></p>
        <p>Spirit Sentinel says 'Good, good, Do you know this
        place, Waring , this forest? The wasichu call it the
        Emerald Jungle, but we know it only as the terrible
        place. Where there is no spirituality, we are weak. The
        lost city in the middle of this jungle is a great void of
        belief not only absent of spirituality, but actually
        draining it from others. We are here to neutralize that
        void. The void is like the sky, and nothing escapes its
        gaze. If it senses us, it will drain us away and
        sometimes it turns our minds, making us [<strong>like the
        wasichu</strong>], crazy for things with no meaning. </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'What like the wasichu?'</strong></p>
        <p>Spirit Sentinel says 'Yes, there are some of us who
        have turned their backs on our world and struggle for
        possesions and power over others. These lost ones are our
        brothers and we cry for them. Our hearts are in pain like
        bleeding wounds when we think of them. The path of might
        will lead you to one of our lost brothers. We are afraid
        there is nothing we can do for him now, so you must
        eliminate him when you [<strong>find him</strong>]. </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'How do i find him?'</strong></p>
        <p>Spirit Sentinel says 'He left us long ago and walked
        the land for ages. He soon met a man, one of the
        pointy-ears that live underground. This man was like a
        void just liike the one over that terrible place now. Our
        Brother-Friend was attracted to this man's desire and
        ambition. He no doubt thought that he could get what he
        wanted in service of this [<strong>dark point ear</strong>]
        who denied his own creator. </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'What dark point ear?'</strong></p>
        <p>Spirit Sentinel says 'After our brother began
        traveling with this point-ear, they became shrouded in a
        darkness we could not peer through. The point-ear was a
        powerful being and we soon lost their trail. We have no
        idea where he could be now. Although, after all these
        centuries, he has no doubt been gathering and cultivating
        his wealth and power. He must be an incredibly
        influential being at this point. Find this point-ear and
        draw our brother out, then destroy him and bring us
        proof. We await your return in somber mourning. </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Head to Mistmoore. Find the wolf spirit,
            Black Dire. He is STRONG and he has 4 slighty weaker
            wolves as his four guardians. Black Dire hits hard
            and fast for up to 200 HP per swipe, so use extreme
            caution.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Black Dire is not a timed spawn, but you
            can kill the Advisor in the general vicinity of the
            Library (</strong><a

        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Black Dire is by the ramp leading up to
            the castle but you don't go up ramp. Instead, head
            all the way up the canyon that passes under the
            bridge. At base of cliff you will see 4 wolfs and
            Black Dire in the middle. In order to get a response
            from the wolf you have to con Warmly. He is
            truespirit faction. When you walk up to him and hail
            him this is what he says:</strong></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Black Dire says 'So, you've come. I suppose my
        brothers have sent you to lead me back to their flock.
        Those fools are so blinded by their devotion they know
        nothing of life. If they only knew the power I've become,
        the luxuries I've amassed, the pleasures I've known, they
        too would leave that sour and unrewarding existence in
        seconds. You know, you could come to know what I have,
        shaman. You found me, which speaks of your intelligence;
        we could use you. What do you say, Waring ? [<strong>Will
        you join</strong>] my master Mayong Mistmoore? </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'I will NOT join you'</strong></p>
        <p>Black Dire says 'Good shaman, now bare your neck that
        I may show our master your devotion in death. The more
        blood you spill upon the grass, the more impressed our
        Lord Mistmoore will be. Then maybe, just maybe, you will
        be allowed to scour our kitchen floors in the eternity of
        unlife. TEAR him to pieces, my wolves! <br>
        Black Dire bites YOU for 200 points of damage.<br>
        Black Dire bashes YOU for 60 points of damage.<br>
        Black Dire bites YOU for 200 points of damage.<br>
        Black Dire bites YOU for 200 points of damage.<br>
        Black Dire begins to cast a spell.<br>
        YOU writhe in the grip of agony.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Ah well, no easy task killing Black Dire
            and his friends. It has also been reported that
            conversation with Black Dire is not necessary.
            Killing him outright will work just as well. Also, if
            the accompanying wolf guardians are green to all in
            the party, it is reported that Black Dire can be
            pulled without agroing his guardians. </strong></p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Once you kill Black Dire, loot his pelt.</strong></p>

            Jungle, loc +1250, +300.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>You say, 'Hail Spirit Sentinel' </strong></p>
        <p>Spirit Sentinel begins to weep softly as he sees the
        pelt, battered and bloody. After a few moments, he says,
        'We can only hope his passing was quick and painless. The
        Dire was powerful and yet you overcame him. Always
        remember that when you became [<strong>Heyokah</strong>],
        it was the passing of a noble, yet misguided being that
        allowed you to do so. You should hold a special place in
        your heart for him and what he was in life. To help you
        remember him, we will fashion this pelt into a pair of
        boots and give them to you.<br>
        With every step you take, you must think on the Dire,
        else his death be in vain forever.' <br>
        Your faction standing with TrueSpirit got better<br>
        You gain party experience!!</p>

        <p><strong>You say, 'What is heyokah?'</strong></p>
        <p>Spirit Sentinel says 'Yes, you have walked the Path of
        the Heyokah to its end. You have become what few have and
        we will now call to you as Heyokah Duhara . From now on,
        you are a direct link between the spirits and man.
        Whether your goals are to help us or master us, you are
        welcomed. Though there is little time for celebration. Do
        you feel the darkness of this place, the forest? To eyes
        not trained to see beyond physical appearances, it seems
        like any other forest. But you know, as do we, of the
        mantle over the city threatening all of us. We must [<strong>rub
        it out</strong>]. </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'How can we rub it out?'</strong></p>
        <p>Spirit Sentinel says 'There are many such mantles
        scarring the universe and each is very different from the
        last. Removing them requires that we learn how they were
        created and go about reversing the damage done. We cannot
        enter under the mantle for long which is why we search
        out Heyokah such as yourself. We need you to enter the
        city and find out what you can about the [<strong>city's
        demise</strong>]. We hope you will do this for the cause
        of balance but if you desire none but your own power, we
        shall grant that as well</p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'What about the city's demise?'</strong></p>
        <p>Spirit Sentinel says 'It was known as Torsis. During
        its history it amassed great wealth and power yet it
        eventually crumbled. No one understands what happened.
        The men of the world ask themselves how a nation as
        successful as Torsis could ever fall. Some blame plague,
        internal unrest, the constant encroachment of the forest,
        and marauding bands of monsters but we alone know what
        happened. Just as Tabien and Glaron lost sight of their
        spiritual paths, so did Torsis. Without the awe and
        inspiration of that which was greater than themselves,
        they eventually withered away. The mantle was born long
        before the last days, though, and what we need to learn
        is [<strong>how it all began</strong>]. </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'Tell me how it all began'</strong></p>
        <p>Spirit Sentinel says 'Excellent! Go into the city and
        gather what evidence you can. The ghosts who still walk
        the streets may hoard precious memories that will aid us.
        Take this booklet and combine what you find in it. Then
        bring me the completed report. From there, we will know
        where to look next. </p>
