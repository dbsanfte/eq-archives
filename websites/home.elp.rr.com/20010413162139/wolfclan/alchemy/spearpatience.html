                running.<br>
                Have your pet spell ready to cast.<br>
                Have gate or evac, if wizard/druid in group,

        <p><strong>You say, 'Hail Ooglyn'</strong></p>
        <p>Ooglyn says 'Ooooh, it you, shaman . Me's been waitin
        for you cuz our frenz say you comin an need da test. So's
        I gib you da test. Hmm, now where me put it? Ooglyn been
        waiting for sign for so long dat me forget where me put
        test. Keep your eyes out for sign while me look for test.
        Oh, hey, shaman, they gib you gem? I need dat gem,
        please, heheh. </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Give her the gem. </strong></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Ooglyn says 'Ahhh, tank you, now me can...OH LOOK!! DA
        SIGN!!!! Oh, sorry you missed it. The sign show you where
        to wait for da test. Follow me...I like you so I take you
        there. We goin for a swim, shaman! <br>
        Your faction standing with TrueSpirit got better<br>
        You gain party experience!!<br>
        Ooglyn begins to cast a spell.<br>
        Ooglyn feels much faster.<br>

        Ooglyn is surrounded by a brief lupine aura.<br>
        Ooglyn begins to cast a spell.<br>
        Ooglyn's body pulses with energy. </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>After Ooglyn finishes casting spells, she
            starts to run away. Follow her until she disappears
            into the water. Then run out over the water (make
            sure you have levitation and some sort of underwater
            breathing on) and head to loc -1600, +4200. Dive down
            about 10 feet into the water and cast your pet
            spells. Then proceed to the bottom of the ocean and
            wait patiently as this test suggests.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Ooglyn may be waiting there for you there
            or she may not. If she's not there, no worries. It
            won't effect the quest. </strong></p>
            <p><strong>Patiently wait at that location. Five
            different spirits or Heyokah will eventually spawn.
            Be patient. Your goal is to receive &quot;a broken
            arrow&quot; from Abe, and a &quot;gem&quot; from the
            Greater Spirit. As such, only the conversations with
            Abe and the Greater Spirit are presented here.
            Conversations with the others is merely
            &quot;fluff&quot;. Did I mention patience?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>NOTE: You will also have to fend off the
            regular Sharks and the much tougher Killer Sharks
            that roam the area while you wait.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>TIP: Despite what ANY of the spirits or
            Ooglyn say to you, DO NOT leave this location. They
            are only trying to trick you. Remember, this is about
            Patience.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Now then, once you are at the bottom of
            the ocean at neg 1600 pos 4200 . . . </strong></p>

        <p><strong>You say, 'Hail Abe the Abandoned'</strong></p>
        <p>Abe the Abandoned turns his head slowly toward you but
        his eyes never come into focus. You can't tell if he's
        looking at you, behind you, or right in front of his own
        face. Then ,suddenly, he shouts at the top of his lungs,
        'HOOOOKAAAHEEEEYYYY! I AM [<strong>ABE</strong>]!' </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'Who are you abe?'</strong></p>
        <p>Abe the Abandoned says 'Nothing is hidden. All is
        discernible if you only know where to look and you have
        the right [<strong>eyes</strong>]. Don't be angry with me
        if you can't get your eyes right to see what you're
        looking for. I'd lend you mine but I don't wear the same
        size. </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'What eyes?'</strong></p>
        <p>Abe the Abandoned begins to draw a picture in the mud
        with his finger although it doesn't seem to make any
        sense at all. He points to his picture and nods
        approvingly at you, saying, 'You see? The curtains fell
        and it was naught but a dream upon a landscape that we
        thought we knew. The dream of the [<strong>Combine</strong>]
        fulfilled when we finally trimmed our fingernails and
        looked into the mud. And now we are abandoned, in a world
        that none can see, no one has the eyes.' </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'What is the combine?'</strong></p>
        <p>Abe the Abandoned shakes his head in amusement and
        says, 'Heheheh, yeah, you'd think so, wouldn't you? But I
        guess not' </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>After a few minutes, Abe will speak again.
            Be patient! :)</strong></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Abe the Abandoned says 'Shaman? My time will soon be
        at hand and I fear I will never see our friends again.
        But the arrow must be given, our holy broken arrow.
        Shaman, will you bear our obligation and [<strong>give
        them the arrow</strong>]? You will know who to give it to
        when it is time. </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'Yes i will give them the arrow'</strong></p>
        <p>Abe the Abandoned removes a quiver slung across his
        shoulder and solemnly hands it to you without a word. </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>A few minutes later . . . </strong></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Abe the Abandoned suddenly gasps and says, 'I have
        found it! I know the answer! Come with me and I will tell
        you. Eyes are everywhere and this knowledeg is not for
        everyone. Finally my centuries of waiting are over
        hahahaha! Follow me Shaman! </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Stay glued to that spot. DO NOT follow him</strong>
            </p>
            <p><strong>After or before Abe spawns, a greater
            spirit also spawns . . .</strong></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>a greater spirit begins to cast a spell.<br>
        a greater spirit's body pulses with energy.</p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'Hail a greater spirit'</strong></p>
        <p>a greater spirit says 'You have walked the path of
        patience and you now know what to expect. We are
        watchers. Our eyes are everywhere and we must be patient
        and quiet else we may miss what could be harmful. Can you
        sit still quietly and wait for just the right moment,
        then open your eyes with a fury and act with all the
        energy you have cultivated? Timing is everything, and
        without patience you cannot be sensitive to timing. You
        have shown your patience here and we believe you are
        ready to walk the [<strong>next path</strong>]. </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'What is the next path?'</strong></p>
        <p>a greater spirit says 'You know trust and patience.
        But before we can allow you to act in our name, we must
        know that when you do decide to act, you will make the
        right choices. We must ask that you now walk the path of
        wisdom. You must walk to the great plains and search out
        one of us. He is a wanderer, and it is his nature to
        drift with the winds and weather doing what he can to
        ensure understanding and longevity to all that respect
        their home. He will not be easy to find, though, and you
        must remember what you have learned down here to succeed
        in finding him. When you do, give him this gem and follow
        his instructions.</p>
