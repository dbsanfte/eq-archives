        <blockquote>

            Surestout</strong><br>
            Rathe Mountains, (on cyclops hill), <strong>Blinde

        </blockquote>
        <p align="left">While the information here is gleened
        from conversations with Capt. Surestout, it is reported
        that any of the above will yield the same information and
        &quot;tiny gem&quot;. Here is the Surestout method of
        beginning the quest:</p>
        <p><strong>Go to Gornit's island in OOT, approx. loc 800,
        -5400, kill Capt Surestout (green con at level 54, one
        ebolt kills him). A lesser spirit will spawn where he's
        killed, hail the spirit. </strong></p>
        <p>Capt Surestout died.<br>
        Your faction standing with PiratesOfGunthak got worse<br>
        Your faction standing with FirionaVie got better<br>
        Capt Surestout says 'You have run me through! Beware the
        Pirates of Gunthak.. They will avenge me.. Unngh!! <br>
        a lesser spirit begins to cast a spell.<br>
        a lesser spirit's body pulses with energy.</p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'Hail a lesser spirit'</strong></p>
        <p>a lesser spirit says 'Did you take this person's life,
        shaman? <br>
        a lesser spirit regards you indifferently -- You could
        probably win this fight.</p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'Yes'</strong></p>
        <p>a lesser spirit says 'Why have you taken this person's
        life? Did he threaten your life? Did you dislike him? Or
        was his death a profit to you in some way? </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'He threatened my life'</strong></p>
        <p>a lesser spirit says 'I see. It brings me sadness to
        see another die, but his heart was black and a great
        nothingness. His body will become the grass now. Thank
        you for what you have done, shaman. </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'Who are you?'</strong></p>
        <p>a lesser spirit says 'What, or who, I am isn't as
        important as what, or who, WE are. Do you wish to know
        more, shaman? </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'I wish to know more'</strong></p>
        <p>a lesser spirit says 'That is good. Take this gem. It
        is a part of us like the clouds to the sky and is a
        wonderful gift from the grandfather. Take this gem to
        where the humans gather to spoil the land and water. Some
        call it a port. There you will find one of us, a shaman
        like yourself. Give him the gem and perhaps he will tell
        you more of the spirits.</p>
