            <p><b>Book 1</b> </p>
            <p>Neh Ashiir's disappearance will always be cloaked
            in mystery. We of Torsis have a saying that goes
            &quot;Neh's chances&quot;. We all know this is used
            to define an innumerable variable but not many know
            of its relation to the event in the early years of
            our fair city. For as many people as there were in
            Torsis there were that many theories regarding Neh
            Ashiir's disappearance. Others say there were
            political tensions between the queen and her lord, so
            much so that she had to leave to escape death. And
            for good measure a few pointed to the stars and said
            that people from beyond the sky took her. One thing
            all agreed upon however is that the relationship
            between the royal couple was decaying. Political
            scrutinizers noted small personal habits between the
            two that implied a separation of intimacy during
            their public appearances. Many even tie the highly
            publicized Crusade of Kirn into the disappearance of
            Neh as Kirn left the city only a few weeks before. It
            is recorded in many texts that the visage of Rak'
            Ashiir reflected his despair over his wife's
            vanishing although it is a well known fact that it
            was mostly an act played by the King to keep up his
            illusion of nobility. Perhaps one day we will find
            the truth but at this point it would mean little to
            the public. </p>
            <p><b>Book 2 - Keeper of the House's Log</b></p>
            <p>1. New wash basins must be acquired. Servant Hujin
            will see the Quartermaster and place the order
            tomorrow. </p>
            <p>2. The chandelier in the main hall was finally
            repaired tonight. Payment must be sent to the
            contract holder tomorrow. </p>
            <p>3. Advisor Snith ordered that I personally find
            and acquire 3 dozen finely made vials. What they are
            for he would not explain and was very firm that I do
            this as quickly as possible. Best to make haste to
            fulfill the order, rumours abound of the Advisor's
            mastery of the arcane. </p>
            <p>4. We've been low on candles for the last week.
            There is no explanation for the shortage of wax says
            our civilian contract holder. Perhaps I should send a
            Palace Reaver escort with the next pick up crew. The
            craftsman may have the intelligence to figure the
            symbolism. </p>
            <p>5. It is imperative that we return the High
            Scale's Icon to the church as discretely as possible.
            If Rak Ashiir returns from his journey early and
            discovers it was found in the royal bedroom it may
            prove disastrous. I cannot decide whether to place it
            ourselves with the help of our Black Guard, or to
            approach one of our contacts in the church. The less
            people that know of this the better. It might be
            prudent to ..remove.. the servant who found it within
            the sheets. </p>
            <p><b>Book 3</b> </p>
            <p>Throughout the history of the High Scale it was
            common for the knights to practice complete celibacy.
            It wasn't until the controversial Kirn was given the
            hallowed title that contact between the sexes became
            tolerated. While Kirn wasn't the mightiest of the
            High Scales he was able to achieve many great
            victories in the name of our Lord of Fear. One being
            the battle known as the Bone Rending when Kirn lost
            his fabled whip, Thriaxis' Tail, as was still able to
            defeat scores of his enemies using his hands only.
            Before this battle many believed Kirn could not
            fulfil his duties as a leader and patriot for the
            people. </p>
            <p>However Kirn's might and his lecture on the use of
            females in religious crusade and duty convinced the
            public that celibacy had its place in divinity but
            non-celibacy also had a place and value within the
            church. A shrine depicting Kirn among many women was
            constructed in remembrance of his controversial reign
            although his corpse was never brought back for burial
            as it was lost far across the ocean among distant
            brothers on faith.</p>

        <p>Spirit Sentinel says 'Hmmm, it appears the queen's
        disappearance wasn't as random as we thought. It also
        looks as if this High Scale were having some sort of
        affair with Neh. We have little but speculation at this
        point, so making it known to Nak'Ashiir would do nothing.
        Perhaps finding the resting place of the High Scale will
        show us more of what really happened. We suspect the icon
        mentioned in this log could now be located in the city's
        old temple. Find the icon and bring it to Kirn, wherever
        he is. Tell us what you learn afterwards. <br>
