            members have now established presence on 2 other servers for fun and 
            diverse playing. One is a roleplaying server Firiona Vie where we 
            are dark elves. There you can only select one character and you can't 
            speak common language so other races will not understand you.<br>
            We are also now on Vallos Zek server which is a PvP (player vs player) 
            and team based - where there is a war between races. On this server 
            we are the nice elves - high elves, wood elves, and half elves so 
            pick one of those races. Class is whatever you think is good against 
            other players.<br>
            So join us on these two servers (especially PvP) for fun guild activities. 
            If you come on one of these 2 servers, open or join a channel &quot;dol&quot; 
            to see who is on. Also, check the site often for more news and updates.</font></font></td>
