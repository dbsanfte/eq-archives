      OF MULTIGROUP RAIDS)</font><font face="Georgia"><br>
      This is a sort of guide of do's and don'ts to familiarize yourself with 
      before you attend your first multi-group raid. It is important to know these 
      points for both your safety and the safety of the raid so please read and 
      understand what you can expect and what is expected of you. </font>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="4">1- BE ON TIME!</font><font face="Georgia"> 
        Make the time to travel to the meeting spot so you are there ready to 
        be grouped at posted raid start time. If you are not there you will not 
        be guaranteed a spot on the raid and may be left behind. If you know that 
        you will not have time to travel to meeting spot before the raid make 
        the time the night before. Ports will begin 1 hour before raid start time 
        and will cease from 15 minutes prior to raid start time to allow porters 
        to be on time, grouped and listen to the raid instructions. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="4">2- Keep OOC clear, please use only if asked.</font><font face="Georgia"> 
        Shout is strictly for raid leaders and OOC is for Group Leaders and main 
        debuffers. If you need buffs (i.e. clarity, haste, shaman buffs etc) Persons 
        are designated before each raid to handle these please send them tells 
        directly. (There may be times when we are resting and to have fun or lighten 
        moods OOC can be used but please use good judgment on when it is appropriate 
        and do not spam. We are not all business but sometimes have to be *winks*)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="4">3- If you have an issue please advise your 
        group leader,</font><font face="Georgia"> do not send tells directly to 
        raid leaders for they are busy making sure things are running smoothly. 
        If your group leader deems its something that needs to be brought to leaders 
        attention they will send them a tell.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="4">4- Change all of the following settings</font><font face="Georgia"> 
        -- Turn of PC names, use /target &lt;player name&gt; if you need to buff 
        someone. Turn your clip plane all the way down. Turn your particle effects 
        off. Type the commands /serverfilter on and /showspelleffects off. Turn 
        all new Luclin models off. All of these will help prevent lag and LDs. 
        If you do not know how to do some of these ask someone in your guild.</font><font face="Georgia"><br>
        <br>
        <font size="4">5- Keep AFK's to a minimum- </font>A move can be called 
        at anytime and you must be ready for it. If you must go AFK advise your 
        group leader</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="4">6- Listen to your raid/group leader.</font><font face="Georgia"> 
        Pay attention closely during the whole raid for commands.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="4">7- If Camp Out is called do not ask questions. 
        </font><font face="Georgia">Make sure your cleric gets camped first then 
        get yourself camped. If you cant sit use /q. Camp to an alt and join the 
        raid channel and wait for the all clear from those FD to come back in.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="4">8- Never Evac out from a raid. </font><font face="Georgia">If 
        you do so it can result in you and your party not being able to return 
        to the raid. Death is a part of raids and can and will happen. We have 
        plenty of clerics that can provide a 96% res and we also have many that 
        are come that are experienced in CR's.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="4">9- NEVER NEVER NEVER Break Mes. </font><font face="Georgia">This 
        is strictly for a MA or SA to do. Make sure you have hotkeys set up before 
        the raid to assist the MA and SA that are designated. have your autoattack 
        off so you can hit assist and verify your on right mob before attacking. 
        Breaking mes can wipe out a 5+ group raid in seconds if done at right 
        time so not a good thing =). If you are caught breaking mes on a raid 
        you will be warned once, twice you will be asked to leave the raid. If 
        you are caught on several raids and asked to leave you may not be allowed 
        to sign up for future raids.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="4">10- NEVER NEVER NEVER heal or buff the 
        puller unless you are asked directly to do so.</font><font face="Georgia"> 
        Healing or buffing a fd puller can result in what he has agroed to come 
        down on you and if he/she is trying to split mobs can result in too many 
        coming and wiping out raid parties.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="4">11- Casters -- It is VERY important that 
        you do a few things.</font><font face="Georgia"> 1st do not nuke before 
        mob is 70% or less, you will cause the mob to come after you and several 
        casters doing so can cause a ping pong effect which can be very dangerous 
        on a raid. When INC is called STAND UP! If you don't the mob's) will come 
        straight for you and you probably will end up dead. DO NOT sit down right 
        after casting, give it a few seconds for the melee to regain the agro 
        back, this also is what causes ping ponging.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="4">12- Do not expect experience or loot and 
        expect to die.</font><font face="Georgia"> A multi raid is not a time 
        to expect exp and loot, its a time to work together as a team and meet 
        goals and help guildmates. If you expect exp and loot or get angry every 
        time you die a mult-raid is probably something you will not have fun on, 
        get bored and become a liability to the raid. Most are there to have fun, 
        experience something new and help their guildmates. Please do not allow 
        your unhappiness with not getting exp and loot or dying affect their fun.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="4">13- If you have a problem with someone 
        in your group, Do not ridicule them, berate them etc. Advise your group 
        leader of the issues. </font><font face="Georgia">If it is the group leader 
        or you don't feel comfortable approaching your group leader send a tell 
        to one of the officers in the guild, please try not to make it the officer 
        that is leading the raid. This officer then will intervene on the issues 
        and will decide an appropriate coarse of action to take after consulting 
        with other officers and or raid leaders.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="4">14- Looting is only to be done by the group 
        leader.</font><font face="Georgia"> No drops will be distributed on the 
        spot. Any trade items will be held for after raid in which a designated 
        area will be announced for everyone to gather for distribution of those 
        items.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="4">15- When a move is called NEVER pass the 
        raid leader and do not wander. </font><font face="Georgia">Go directly 
        to where you are told to and stay put. Certain raids (i.e. Fear) moving 
        even a little out of the camp area can result in a major agro on the camp 
        and a wipe out.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="4">16- Relax, have fun!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia">Sincerely,</font></p>
