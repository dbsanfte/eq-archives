        Raid Results<br>
        A few raids to report on. 1st the dragon raids that Cyblade took on. Vox 
        and Nagafen both went down last week at the hands of FC and friends. I 
        would like to say a big thanks to all those who came and helped take these 
        two down and we had a blast doing it. Vox unfortunately didn't drop the 
        white scale that Cyblade needed so we will be slapping her around again 
        at end of the month. Nagafen however had a couple little suprises for 
        us. First of we got the red dragon scale for the warriors in our guild. 
        Second he was feeling generous and dropped not one but two CoF's which 
        were randomed. CoM last weekend went very well, Grats to Lorith and Desspair 
        on the Ornate Runed Shield. From Kael raid grats to Shkahl on quest gloves, 
        Drezzt on Bow of the Huntsman, Giluuk on the Thunder Runed Great Sword. 
        Lastly Fear was a bit rough on us this go round. I want to express my 
        deep gratitude to the guilds that came and helped us recover PN, SoF, 
        GoV. Only item I am aware of awarded from this was the Thorny Vine boots 
        which went to Vanel!</font></p>

        First a very big CONGRATS To Genievea on completing her druid epic! Watch 
        out Norrath she is blowin leaves everywhere!<br>
        Grats to Evelle and Jeron on getting their epic items from Phinny. Thanks 
        all who dropped everything to accomplish this last minute.<br>
        I would also like to say sorry for slacking on keeping this updated. With 
        planning the RL trip to Kansas in which many of us finally had the chance 
        after years together to meet face to face and just general RL stuff guild 
        event updates have slacked here. I want to say the trip last weekend was 
        a trip of a lifetime and one I shall not too soon forget. I hope that 
        everyone can save those coppers and hopefully be able to attend the one 
        in the works for August or September in Minnesota where we will go pester 
        the King of the Renissance Fair our very own Berowne</font><font face="Georgia">.</font></p>

        I knew you could beat Fild there and winks*<br>
        After Cyblade's issues with the bard epic turn in's and the GM's refusal 
        to help further on this issue we continue to take down Phinny as often 
        as we can. He has fell to the hands of FC 3 times this week and STILL 
        has not given us a new back bone. Don't worry Cy we will get it yet! We 
        did take down Undertow for Jeron *cheers* 4 more to go hun!<br>
        Weds night we also took down VSR with very little outside help and got 
        Magdalene and Tashea one more step closer to their leaf blowers!<br>

        We spent a few hours in The Hole and due to some very bad chain ld's we 
        didnt get as far as we wanted and had to call it a night to prevent endagering

        for our casters.<br>

        We spent the night with Merciless in the Royals. Even though the king 
        decided to have us for dinner (and not to chat about politics) we moved 
        very efficiently and quickly through the area. Great job to Slim and Catharsis 
        on MA as well as Qillz and Ielene on tag team mesing The prince went down 
        very quickly which has brought Qillz one step closer to his snake stick

        Litheblade:</font><font face="Georgia" size="3"> Friday's Hate raid went 
        with near perfection after a tense start at the break in. It seemed as 
        if we had the whole floor in the little room, but rose to the task and 
        triumphed. Accolades must be heaped upon Cidz for ensuring that Innoruuk 
        had no one to aid him when we faced off. Even the immediate and unfortunate 
        loss of Evelle did not keep Saper from pinning Innoruuk into the corner 
        where he would meet his doom. Pictures are located in our Trophy Case.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Was an awesome night all around. We got 
        3 Overking kills, and 2 Queen kills. Our previous attempt to take down 
        the queen was not pretty, but we got her twice this night. We would have 
        taken her down a third time, but an odd pathing bug made her run through 
        the library and bring back a dozen friends. The king reluctantly turned 
        over 3 copies of a scroll to our clerics, post mortem.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia" size="4">Epic Progress for Grammies, Humphery, and 
        Tokealot!!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Grammies found herself in dire need of 
        medical attention when a Jade Reaver finally dropped in CoM and the shock 
        of it induced a major heart attack. Fortunately FC's trained medical personnel 
        were able to ensure her health as she finally was able to loot a JR. For 
        Humphery's and Tokealot's JR story, we direct you to FCNN Correspondant 
        Giluuk's account.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="4"><br>
        Much Epic almost at hand!!<br>
        <br>
        <font size="3">Much is almost in possession of his epic, thanks to last 
        night's Hate raid. All he needs now is the Crown of Elemental Mastery, 
        (which FC has banked) and a turn in and then FC will finally have an epic'd 
        Mage. Congratz Much!!</font></font></p>

        we were pokin around in WW and the benevolence scout was up, i said what 
        the hell and i turned in my thingy. I single pulled the captain and we 
        proceded to kick his arse...barely.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">The people involved were me (tanking), 
        Drezzt (layin the smackdown), Arlessa (doin what she does best... almost 
        killing me a few times over ), and Geni (being backup-healer, buffer,

      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3"><b>From FCNN Correspondant Giluuk:</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Tonight, after most of the CoM raid had 
        to call it a night, we pulled a Black Reaver from the first room. We had 
        8 of us left at the time...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Group 1<br>
        Lorith<br>
        Grammies<br>
        Tokalot<br>
        Jlnolan</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Group 2<br>
        Giluuk<br>
        Xiddix <br>
        Humphery<br>
        Vuruka</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">We managed to bring him down, and another 
        imediately took his place. Evac was suggested, but we stayed and took 
        down the second, only to have a third take its place. The first reaver 
        had no possessions, and the call to evac was made as the second was being 
        inspected. Before the casting was done (with the very last bit of mana 
        our casters had), the Jade Reaver was in hand, and was awarded to Humphery 
        at the zone line.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">We could not in good conscience leave the 
        third reaver near the bridge with out a single mob to keep it company. 
        So we made our way back toward the bridge, medded to full, and proceeded 
        to beat this most recent reaver as well. Lord Giosk took its place when 
        it fell, and Jlnolan quickly searched the reavers remains to find a second 
        Jade Reaver. Having what we came for, and not wanting to end the night 
        on a bad note, we evaced to the zone and Tokalot was awarded the Jade 
        Reaver.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">And to think we nearly left without pulling 
        one last reaver... </font></p>
