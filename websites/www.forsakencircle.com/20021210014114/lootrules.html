        <p><font face="Georgia" size="5">Forsaken Circle Raid Loot Policy</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Georgia" size="3">Items that are dropped on 
          a raid will be awarded by the Loot Master to the appropriate class based 
          on a &#147;Best for the Guild&#148; need before greed concept. </font> 
        </p>
      </div>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3"><br>
        <font size="4">LOOT MASTER</font><br>
        Every raid will have a Loot Master. Group leaders will send this person 
        tells with items that need to be awarded. The item name and what class(es) 
        it bests suits will be announced. At that time if you need the item and 
        is considered an upgrade for you send a tell to the loot master advising 
        you wish to be considered for the item. ONLY tells the Loot Master should 
        receive are those above, they should be considered part of the raid lead 
        team and not be flooded with other tells it will only delay the award 
        process. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">The Loot Master will notify the officers 
        of who is in need of the item via an officers channel. If this is a joint 
        raid the alliance guild officers will also be present in this chat. A 
        quick vote will be made and then announced. The person accepting the item 
        will then be removed from drop rotation until everyone in that class category 
        has received an item. One exception to this will be breastplates/robes 
        due to their stat value and rarity. Breastplates/robes will be rewarded 
        to the person on raid who will benefit the guild the most for the class 
        even if they have received a prior drop.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">If there is a conflict of interest when 
        an item drops (i.e. the Loot master feels she/he should receive the item), 
        The loot master will notify the officers of those interested in the item 
        and also the fact that she/he would like to be considered for the drop 
        as well. Decision will be made as noted above and announced. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="4">BEST FOR THE GUILD</font><font face="Georgia" size="3"><br>
        This policy is created to both reward members for longevity and activity 
        in the guild. We strive to all work together to do bigger and better things 
        and the only way we can all ensure this is by having a guild that works 
        together as a team. We feel it is important to not just be in the guild 
        but to take an active roll. So for this reason we have created a policy 
        that works towards both of these goals. It is best for the guild to reward 
        players that have gained sufficient levels to allow guild raids to happen, 
        as well as reward players for loyalty and time spent helping the guild 
        progress as a whole. All of these factors are considered when awarding 
        drops to raid participants.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="4">LOOT DISBURSEMENT DURING RAIDS</font><font face="Georgia" size="3"><br>
        All groups will be assigned a group leader. This person will be responsible 
        and only them for looting all kills accredited to the group. They will 
        be responsible for notifying the Loot Master via tell what the item is 
        up for award. The Loot Master will then follow procedures noted above. 
        If the group leader should leave the raid all items are to be turned in 
        to Loot Master and a new group leader will be appointed by the raid leaders.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Any currency, gems that are not reagents, 
        or unclaimed tradable items will go to guild bank and follow the policies 
        mentioned on guild bank rules. Again this is to fund future raids and 
        expenses of clerics and chanters on raids.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="4">ITEMS OF SUBSTANTIAL VALUE</font><font face="Georgia" size="3"><br>
        When a droppable non-expendable item that is of substantial value is awarded 
        it is considered guild property. The person being awarded the item will 
        be advised that should they obtain something better or should they leave 
        the guild the item will need to be returned to the guild bank to be redistributed. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="4">QUEST DROPS</font><font face="Georgia" size="3"><br>
        Quest drops will work a bit differently for reasons that a person may 
        be more in need of the item over another. Some quests have level limitations 
        (ie paladin books from Vox and Naggy) and stage a person is at in a quest 
        is also a factor. We will evaluate quest drops based on can the person 
        use the item now that is being quested (ie quest spell or epic) and if 
        the person is actively working on the quest and what stage they are at. 
        If we have 2 people of same level and same stage in quest the item will 
        go to the person who will benefit the guild the most, quest loots do not 
        affect equipment/weapon rotations.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3"><br>
        <font size="4">GUESTS ON RAIDS</font><br>
        The officers MUST first approve any guest. There may be times when in 
        order to even do the raid we have to invite people of different guilds 
        (or friends of FC) to fill these gaps in order for the raid to happen. 
        In this case we will treat the guest with the same considerations as noted 
        above, how often they assist FC in raids, current equipment and character 
        level. This applies to any weapons or armor drops other than Robes Breastplates 
        and quest items. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Quest drops as well as planar BP&#146;s 
        and Robes will always go to guild members first even if that guild member 
        has received a prior item and guest has not. If there is no guild member 
        present from the class or guild member already has the BP/Robe/Quest item 
        it will be given to the guest that can best use the BP/Robe/quest drop 
        based on above loot policy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="4">IN CLOSING</font><font face="Georgia" size="3"><br>
        We pride ourselves on our need before greed values as a guild. We know 
        that while any loot policy will not be liked by all we feel this is the 
        most fair to individuals as well as helping the guild advance in their 
        goals. We are in this together to help each other strive and grow and 
        by working together and helping one another one day at a time we shall 
        meet our goals as friends. The true way to succeed as a guild is to always 
        support each other and work together. While we may not be the fastest 
        to get there we will find the victories all the more sweet working together 
        as a family to achieve them.</font></p>
