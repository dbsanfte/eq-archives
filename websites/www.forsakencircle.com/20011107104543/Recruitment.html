<div class="Center" style="font-size: 20pt; font-weight: bold">Recruitment</div>
<div style="font-weight: bold; margin: 16px 0px">Hail potential Forsaken Circle member!</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 12px; text-align: justify">So you wish to join our family? Here are some things you should know before you apply.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 12px; text-align: justify">We are a close knit group of friends that decided to start a strong guild. We are a fun loving group of adventurers and seek the same in our new membership. If this is you by nature please read on. If you are only looking to join a guild to get the ph@t l33tz but yet not be helpful to others, may you find your fortune amongst other clans...</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 12px; text-align: justify">Ahhh... so you wish to hear more and are what we seek? Here is what is needed to be considered for membership.</div>
<ol style="margin-bottom: 12px">
<li>Please read and understand the <a href="Charter.html">Charter</a> as well as the <a href="Rules.html">Code of Conduct and Enforcement</a>.</li>
<li>Obtain a sponsor if you don't already have one. If you don't have one, group with guild members. Search out those close to your level by doing a /who all forsaken. Only a member that has been granted full member status may sponsor you. (i.e. someone not still in their initiation period)</li>
<li>To make sure you can enjoy the guild to its fullest, meaning availibilty of members in your level range to group with and the possibility for you to join the majority of our raids, there is a minimum level recommendation of 35. If you are under 35 and still want to apply you are welcome to do so but finding a sponsor and people to group with might prove very difficult. In addition, to ensure a dynamic grouping and raiding environment, recruitment of Druids and Shadowknights has been closed. Exceptions might be made but you have to be aware that too many of the same class are probably not in your best interest.</li>
<li>Go to the <a href="http://pub66.ezboard.com/bforsakencircle" target="_blank">guild forums</a>, tell us all about yourself. Character name, class, sex, race, and level. Tell us why you desire to join our family.</li>
</ol>
<div style="margin-bottom: 12px; text-align: justify">Your desires will be brought to the guild for a review period of 48 hours, once you have been approved by guild as a whole with no objections you will be brought into the family as an initiate. You will be reviewed for your participation in events, attitudes towards guild and its members and loyalty. The initiation period is a minimal of two weeks and attendance of at least one guild raid/event. Once you have completed the requirements for membership the officers will review feedback from the guild and decide one of the following.</div>
<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom: 12px">Officers feel reviews are good and grant you full member status.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 12px">The officers have found minor issues in the reviews. If this happens we will discuss them with you and see if it is something you are willing to work with us on, if so we will extend the initiation period for an agreed upon time frame and review again.</li>
<li>Issues brought to officers are unfavorable and beyond the ideals of the family or no improvement after initiation extention. At this time we will wish you well and bid you farewell.</li>
</ol>
<div style="margin-bottom: 12px; text-align: justify">We pride ourselves on honor, loyalty and friendship, it is what is expected of every guild member. We hope you look for the same and look forward to having you part of our family. Good luck to you and may the gods watch over your battles.</div>
