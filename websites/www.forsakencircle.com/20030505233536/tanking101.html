              Ubermob tanking -- summary and discussion<br>
              ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
              This post is an effort to condense what I thought were some important 
              contributions to understanding how melee works in EQ. Note that 
              some of this might seem analytically intensive. If this bothers 
              you, please don't post calling people nerds for figuring stuff out. 
              This is pretty long -- apologies for length. I just wanted to toss 
              something out before the main thread disappears again, as it nearly 
              did this spring. The original, this, or some better effort should 
              be stickied.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">I have tried to draw out the important 
              implications from the model and then compiled a list of specific 
              data points. Where I can I have tried to let people speak for themselves 
              about big ideas, but other times I simply summarize and present 
              without citation. I'm sorry if I have overlooked someone's contribution, 
              or missed crediting someone who should have been. Of course special 
              thanks go to Joimster.</font></p>

              <br>
              Here are my findings:<br>
              Thanks for the data! <br>
              The damage a mob does on a standard hit is DB + x*DI, where DB stands 
              for Damage Bonus, DI stands for Damage Interval, and x is an integer 
              between 1 and 20 (inclusive).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Some values that I've calculated, 
              maybe we could start a repository of these values:<br>
              Mob: DB, DI<br>
              Cazic Thule: 200, 20<br>
              Doomshade: 110, 15.5<br>
              Gozzrem: 180, 15<br>
              Kromzek Captain: 60, 10<br>
              Lcea Katta: 160, 20<br>
              Lord Nagafen: 75, 7.5<br>
              Vessel Drozlin: 75, 12<br>
              Yelinak: 100, 25</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">So, Cazic Thule can hit for 220, 
              240, 260, ..., 580, or 600.<br>
              It turns out that kick/bash damage is DB + some integer, so CT could 
              kick for 201, 202, 203, ....</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">The min hit is therefore DB + DI, 
              and the max hit is DB + 20*DI.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">It becomes apparent that we can derive 
              these numbers from a max and min:<br>
              DI = (max hit) - (min hit) / 19<br>
              DB = (min hit) - DI</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">By the way, none of this applies 
              to the hit that finishes off a rune.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">The way Defensive works is it divides 
              DI by 2.<br>
              This puts the min hit at DB + DI/2, and the max hit at DB + 20*DI/2 
              = DB + 10*DI.<br>
              So CT could hit for 210, 220, 230, ..., 390, or 400 with Defensive 
              up.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Any questions?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">These findings somewhat apply to 
              PC damage, actually. I looked at some of my logged data and I could 
              see peaks (not completely empty between peaks) at certain damage 
              values with high damage 2handers (I assume it also appears on 1handers; 
              maybe I'll break out my wurmy for a little test). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Effectively, the weapon's actual 
              damage bonus is the same as my value for DB. The number that is 
              analagous to the mob's max hit is the modal damage for the PC's 
              weapon. Modal damage = DB + 2*(Weapon damage).<br>
              So DI is equal to<br>
              ((DB + 2*(Weapon damage)) - DB)/20<br>
              = (Weapon damage)/10<br>
              And the min hit is still DB + DI.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">So, with my 30/37 lance, DB = 12 
              and DI = 30/10 = 3. So my min hit should be 12 + 3 = 15, which it 
              is according to my parser.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">My min hit with my wurmy should therefore 
              be DB + DI = 8 + 25/10 = 10.5. I'll check that to make sure...</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">I was just reading the about monks 
              hitting for a min of 2 with a SoS (17 damage) in the offhand. This 
              is in complete agreement with my analysis: min hit = DB + (weapon 
              damage)/10 = 0 + 17/10 = 1.7.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Hopefully this has been interesting 
              or helpful to someone.</font></p>

              1. It allows players to empirically evaluate ubermob encounters<br>

              defensive disciplines<br>
              3. It suggests a means to evaluate the relative worth of weapon 
              choice, such as that between 2-handers and 1-handers.<br>
              4. It suggests avenues for analyzing the mechanics of AC itself, 
              including possibly the AC softcap <br>
              5. It suggests a means to consider mob ATK values.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Keple also noted this effect: &quot;so 
              if defensive really divide by 2 the DI (which seems to work with 
              my logs as well), mobs with very low DI and high DB would perhaps 
              be better tanked with evasive...&quot;. Besrikarle noted the difficulty 
              in aggro maintenance when the tank is hitting less often (with evasive) 
              as opposed to less effectively (with defensive).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Another inference to be drawn from 
              the model is the effect of mitigation AC, again drawn out by Joimster:</font></p>

              Quote:<br>
              ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
              <br>
              Mitigation AC should just determine the distribution of hits over 
              the twenty different X values. The distribution would just be a 
              probability for each X value, based on mitigation AC and the mob's 
              attack rating in some way.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">For a tank with high mitigation AC, 
              the probabilities would be skewed such that, generally, there is 
              a higher probability of being hit for a lower X value than a higher 
              X value.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">And it should also be noted that 
              it is possible to mitigate hits into misses. Go tank a decaying 
              skeleton and you'll see that this is true (you have high mitigation 
              AC, it has a low attack rating).</font></p>

            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">The effect of level and AC on mob

            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3"><br>
              Quote:<br>
              -----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
              <br>
              Fact: If we chart of AC versus damage we see a curve that always 
              looks the same. Damage reduces slowly until some critical AC value 
              is reached, then drops off sharply for a period of AC increases, 
              then reduces even more slowly after some second AC point.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Fact: There are nearly always clusters 
              in hit graphs at minimum (N = 1) and maximum (N = 20) damage.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Let's suppose that we can look at 
              a hit as having a fixed component above (N = 20), below (N = 1) 
              or in (1 &lt; N &lt; 20), plus a random component that smears some 
              hits over a range that always includes (N = 1) and (N = 20).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Let's also suppose for a minute that 
              Verants' algorithm makes the clusters by rounding hits below (N 
              = 1) to minimum and above (N = 20) to maximum.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Let's lastly suppose that the random 
              component of the hits isn't nearly as sensitive to AC change as 
              the modal hit value.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Then we can infer that if your AC 
              is high enough that the non-random part of hits is mostly BELOW 
              N = 1, you will get the largest spike at minimum damage. This represents 
              a ceiling on mitigation AC, since the random component will always 
              put SOME hits over (N = 1) and reducing hits further below (N = 
              1) doesn't help. If the random component continues to be reduced 
              even when the modal hit is far under (N = 1), this becomes a soft 
              cap.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Secondly, we can infer that as the 
              modal hit moves through the range (N = 1) to (N = 20), we see the 
              'sharp dropoff' effect that so many people have reported in the 
              AC 700 to 1200 range.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Thirdly, we can infer that if the 
              modal hit is often over (N = 20) most times, you see the big spike 
              at max damage. This represents a floor on AC, which has been observed 
              but never really commented on. Since at (N = 20) the random component 
              will ALSO be large, we find that the floor is softer than the ceiling.</font></p>

              tearing it apart.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Lets assume that Z = (1 - AC/Atk).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">AC = players Mitigation AC (best 
              case right now is about 1200, which would be about 1750 displayed 
              in inventory)<br>
              Atk = Mobs Attack (assume 2000 is max)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Z indicates how well (or badly) a 
              PC can tank.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Example 1:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Best Mitigation AC = 1200<br>
              Best Mob Atk = 2000</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Z = (1 - 0.6) = 0.4</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Take Z times the range, Z*20 = 8. 
              Assume this value is your modal on the bell curve of X probability, 
              you get the following modal hits using the equation provided by 
              Steel Warriors:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Cazic: 360 Damage per hit<br>
              Yelinak: 300 damage per hit</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">This indicates the best case tanking 
              of the mobs above (no defensive).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">If Mitigation falls off, lets say 
              to 1000, the modal values become:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Cazic: 400<br>
              Yelinak: 350</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Now take the monk class which probably 
              has about 800 Mitigation AC with stellar gear, you have the following 
              modals:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Cazic: 440<br>
              Yelinak: 400</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">This is of course assuming both CT 
              and Yelinak have 2000 attack. Those numbers are per hit modal values. 
              Whats really cool is that you can figure out exactly what CT / Yelinak 
              etc, atk rating is:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Atk = MitAC / ((1 - (ModalHit - DB)/20*DI))</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Where MitAC is your mitigation AC<br>
              Modal Hit is the modal damage done to you by the mob, from a log 
              file<br>
              DB is already provided for CT, Yelinak, and mobs in the thread<br>
              DI is already provided for CT, Yelinak and the mobs in the thread</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Now whats really really interesting 
              is you can use this exact same formula to determine what damage 
              you do to mobs.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Assume that Creator has 2000 mitigation 
              AC and the best player character (while cursed) has 1200 ATK. Also 
              assume that Z can never be less than 1, and you get:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Z = 1, which means PC damage to Creator 
              will be modal around the dmg bonus + DI which is 13 dmg (1hndr - 
              main - 20 delay). Which means 50% (bell curve) of hits are 13 damage.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">This is verifiable with a log parse. 
              But this seems true based on our fights with him.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">By the same token you can determine 
              what the Creator's AC is by:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Atk(1 - ((ModalHit - DB)/20*DI)) 
              = AC</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Where Atk is your atk,<br>
              Modal hit is your modal hit<br>
              and AC is the Mobs Mitigation AC.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Would be interesting to plug these 
              into a few log parses and see what comes out.</font></p>

              I'll throw out my last supporting factor for my equation, and I 
              think this might sway you guys.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">You remember when we had Broca's 
              thread on ac, and in the discussion we mentioned a warrior tanking 
              Yelinak. Anyway, he got between 3-4% AC effectiveness for 100 ac 
              added.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Also you remember many many posts 
              that say that only after adding an incremental amount of AC (usually 
              100) that a difference was made in actual effectiveness?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Allright here we go ....</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Example Cazic:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Warrior 1 Goes from a 440 (800 mitAC) 
              to a 400 (1000 mitAC) modal hit on Cazic. This is an increase of 
              200 AC: which is 4.5% tanking increase per 100AC added. Ref. Yelinak 
              post.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">The big scary last point:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">To go from a modal 8 to a modal 7 
              in X probability, use the following formula for Cazic:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Modal 8 was shown to be 1200 Mitigation 
              AC in my above post. To be a better tank and get your Modal to Modal 
              7, you need:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">(1 - AC/2000)*20 = 7 </font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Solving for AC yeilds ...... 1300.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">The step difference between Modals 
              (8 to 7, 7 to 6) are in 100 AC increments.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">------------------------------------------------------------------------</font></p>
