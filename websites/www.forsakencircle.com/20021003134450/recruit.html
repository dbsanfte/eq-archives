      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">Hail potential Forsaken Circle member!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you wish 
        to join our family? Here are some things you should know before you apply.<br>
        We are a close knit group of friends that decided to start a strong guild. 
        We are a fun loving group of adventurers and seek the same in our new 
        membership. If this is you by nature please read on. If you are only looking 
        to join a guild to get the ph@t l33tz but yet not be helpful to others, 
        may you find your fortune amongst other clans...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahhh... so 
        you wish to hear more and are what we seek? Here is what is needed to 
        be considered for membership.</font></p>
      <ol>
        <li><font face="Georgia" size="3">Please read and understand the <a href="charter.html">Charter</a> 
          as well as the <a href="conduct.html">Code of Conduct and Enforcement</a>. 
          <br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Georgia" size="3">Obtain a sponsor if you don't already 
          have one. If you don't have one, group with guild members. Search out 
          those close to your level by doing a /who all forsaken or join us on 
          quest and raid nights. Only way to obtain a sponsor is to show initiative 
          to join by taking it upon yourself to know our members. Only a member 
          that has been granted full member status may sponsor you. (i.e. someone 
          not still in their initiation period). <br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Georgia" size="3">To make sure you can enjoy the guild 
          to its fullest, meaning availability of members in your level range 
          to group with and the possibility for you to join the majority of our 
          raids, there is a minimum level recommendation of 46. If you are under 
          46 and still want to apply you are welcome to do so but finding a sponsor 
          and people to group with might prove very difficult.<br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Georgia" size="3">Go to the guild forums, tell us all 
          about yourself. Character name, class, sex, race, and level. Tell us 
          why you desire to join our family. </font></li>
      </ol>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Georgia" size="3">Your desires 
        will be brought to the guild for a review period of 48 hours minimum. 
        Once you have been approved by guild as a whole with no objections and 
        have obtained a sponsor, you will be brought into the family as an initiate. 
        You will be reviewed for your participation in events, attitudes towards 
        guild and its members and loyalty. The initiation period is a minimal 
        of two weeks and attendance of at least one guild raid/event. Once you 
        have completed the requirements for membership the officers will review 
        feedback from the guild and decide one of the following.</font></p>
      <ol>
        <li><font face="Georgia" size="3">Officers feel reviews are good and grant 
          you full member status. <br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Georgia" size="3">The officers have found minor issues 
          in the reviews. If this happens we will discuss them with you and see 
          if it is something you are willing to work with us on, if so we will 
          extend the initiation period for an agreed upon time frame and review 
          again. <br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Georgia" size="3">Issues brought to officers are unfavorable 
          and beyond the ideals of the family or no improvement after initiation 
          extension. At this time we will wish you well and bid you farewell. 
          </font></li>
      </ol>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pride 
        ourselves on honor, loyalty and friendship, it is what is expected of 
        every guild member. We hope you look for the same and look forward to 
        having you part of our family. Good luck to you and may the gods watch 
        over your battles.<br>
