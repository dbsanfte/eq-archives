        with the persons issues.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">4. Realize that being an officer is much 
        more than in game. Its reading boards, reading quests, studying zones 
        and mobs. And the in game part meaning that you have to be available to 
        talk with members when needed.</font><br>
        <br>
        <font face="Georgia" size="3">5. Can be fully trusted with guild money 
        and spells.<br>
        <br>
        6. Can be fully trusted to not abuse his/her officer status/powers and

        or before following proper proticol) <br>
        <br>
        7. Watch the boards EVERYDAY and throw your 2cp in on issues.<br>
        <br>

        member with a complaint or about to detag. And while dealing with these 
        issues remain objective, calm and logical. But also sympathetic when needed. 
        Basically&#133;you are a crisis manager.<br>
        <br>
        9. Be willing to negotiate, we don&#146;t always agree but sometimes it&#146;s 
        a compromise. Be willing to say even though I think my idea was the right 
        way but I was outvoted so will follow what has been set.<br>
        <br>
        10. Be in officers channel at all times during in game time. </font> </p>
