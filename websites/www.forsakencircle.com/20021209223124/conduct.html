      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        originators of this guild bore a close bond of friendship when they chose 
        to establish this guild &quot;Forsaken Circle&quot;. Many had existed 
        together within this realm for many a Norrathian Sun. The name bears great 
        pride amongst the progenitors of Forsaken Circle.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone 
        amongst the brethren (your sponsor) determines that you are worthy to 
        wear the mantle of Forsaken Circle, then it is your duty to uphold the 
        high principles of the guild out of respect for your sponsor, your fellow 
        guildmates and ultimately yourself. PLEASE do not take this responsibility 
        lightly.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3"><br>
        <font size="5"><b><i>Honor</i></b></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you 
        become a member of Forsaken Circle you have joined a network of individuals 
        that are willing to support you in many ways. Whether this support is 
        the Cleric that will rez your lifeless body, or the druid or wizard, who 
        will port you to the destination you are heading, or even the individual 
        that will suggest the appropriate equipment you should have for your respective 
        age, you will find no shortage of people willing to help you in this guild. 
        Of course this same respect is expected from you also. You are expected 
        to support your brethren in any way that is feasible.</font></p>
      <ol>
        <li><font face="Georgia" size="3">Remember the Golden Rule&#133;<br>
          Thank those that make an effort to help you!<br>
          If someone can't lend a hand at that exact minute, respect that fact. 
          Support classes are entitled to play the game too!<br>
          If someone makes a mistake, don't chastise them! Encourage them to do 
          better the next time.<br>
          If you have a knowledge that can help another member, tell them in a 
          way that won't demean them. <br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Georgia" size="3">Protect the name of the guild and its 
          members.<br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Georgia" size="3">Use appropriate language, don't spew 
          off expletives in /ooc, /shout or /guildsay. <br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Georgia" size="3">Prejudice, whether by race, creed or 
          sexual disposition will not be tolerated. <br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Georgia" size="3">If you have a disagreement with another 
          individual whether a guild-mate or not try to resolve the problem. If 
          you are incapable of doing so, contact an officer and let them intercede. 
          Try not to harbor resentment.<br>
          </font></li>
      </ol>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="5"><b><i>Loot</i></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is frequently a point of contention 
        among players of this game. Amongst guild members the preferred form of 
        looting within groups is auto-splitting pp/Need before Greed/random 0-100 
        rolls on specific items. Other styles of looting will be tolerated as 
        long as a) loot rules are established at the beginning and b) everyone 
        who enters the group understands the rules.</font></p>
      <ol>
        <li><font face="Georgia" size="3">Ninja-looting will not be tolerated. 
          People who are accused of this will be approached by an officer and 
          the situation will be investigated. The offender will be dealt with 
          accordingly which might lead to immediate removal from the guild.<br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Georgia" size="3">When grouped with non-guild members 
          it is expected that you a) determine what the loot rules are as you 
          enter the group b) abide by the loot rules established therein. Failure 
          to do so may lead to your ultimate dismissal from the guild. <br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Georgia" size="3">Be careful looting NO DROP or NO RENT 
          items that the players capable of looting get a chance to. If you don't 
          know what class an item's for&#133; Ask! </font></li>
      </ol>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3"><br>
        <i><b><font size="5">Guild Possessions</font></b></i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At times, if you are deemed worthy, you 
        may be given an item from a higher level player that he can no longer 
        use. It is wrong for you to now assume that this possession is yours to 
        do with as you see fit. You should not take advantage of this act of benevolence. 
        When the time comes that this item is no longer usable by yourself than 
        we ask you to do one of two things before attempting to sell the item. 
        a) Contact the individual who gave the item to you and ask if they would 
        like it back or b) Pass the item down to another guild member whose gameplay 
        would be enhanced by the possession of the item.</font></p>
      <ol>
        <li><font face="Georgia" size="3">Do not expect hand-outs - If someone 
          is gracious enough to give you an item you can use&#133; then express 
          your appreciation to them. But never expect players of higher levels 
          than you to camp or give you items numerous levels above your means. 
          You will feel a greater sense of accomplishment earning your weapons 
          and armor. </font></li>
      </ol>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3"><br>
        <i><b><font size="5">Enforcement</font></b></i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes 
        it becomes necessary to ask a member to leave the guild because of some 
        of the aforementioned guidelines or perhaps other reasons not specified. 
        Here is the procedure that will be followed to ensure that the situation 
        was treated with the utmost fairness.</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Georgia" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warning 
          - Under normal circumstances the person will be spoken to by an officer 
          and advised that repeated behavior of this kind is not acceptable and 
          may lead to his deguilding if not rectified. The sponsor of the accused 
          will also be made aware of this warning. <br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Georgia" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Removal 
          of Guildtag - Depending on the situation the accused may be asked either 
          to go /anon or remove his guildtag until a hearing by the officers can 
          be arranged. <br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Georgia" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers' 
          Meeting - The officers will then review the information and determine 
          whether a deguilding is merited. No less than 75% percent of the officers 
          need to be in attendance for this meeting. A majority vote is necessary 
          to deguild someone. <br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Georgia" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defense 
          Hearing - The accused is entitled to a hearing to explain his side of 
          the story to a gathering of officers. This step is only necessary if 
          the accused requests it. Again, at least 75% of the officers need to 
          be in attendance and the accused's sponsor is also asked to attend. 
          A vote will be taken by the officers after all parties have had a chance 
          to speak. Again a majority vote is required to deguild. This meeting 
          will be held in a private chat room.<br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Georgia" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explanation 
          - A short explanation of why an individual was deguilded will be posted 
          in the Member's Only forum. Out of respect for the departing party little 
          information will be given on the incident in the Forums. If more specific 
          information is desired a tell may be sent to one of the officers. It 
          will be their discretion how much information they choose to give out. 
          Please respect this decision. </font></li>
