      <p><font face="Georgia" size="5">Duties / Requirements for all officers:</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">Here is a brief overview the duties you 
        will have as an officer and some of the expectations we have looked for 
        in the past when appointing them. We are moving into unchartered teritory 
        as the guild grows. Areas that none of us have really gone in our previous 
        EQ lives. This is going to take a lot of work and commitment on all officers 
        no matter what title you hold. It will require decision making in crisis 
        situations, keeping a cool head and being able to keep those around us 
        cool as well. Also as with your regular play time RL always comes first. 
        But by taking an officer position you also are commiting yourself to 70+ 
        other people. <i><b><font color="#FF0000">Your game for the most part 
        is no longer your own.</font></b></i> If you are not there for the guild 
        you put excess stress on your fellow officers but also lose faith from 
        the membership. The key is finding that balance so you don&#146;t burn 
        out. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia">Because of where the guild is heading and 
        where the officers want to see it grow to I want to make sure all of you 
        understand what is expected of you as an officer before you decide to 
        move forward with the elections. Many of us spend several hours outside 
        of game as well as inside of game doing the duties that this job requires. 
        I am going to break this down into two catagories. One is general officer 
        duties the other is the specific position duties. Again these are BASIC 
        outlines. This will give you an idea of what we expect of those officers 
        that hold the positions but its not the be all end all of the duties. 
        </font></p>

        with minor edits made by myself)<br>
        </font><font face="Georgia"> </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">1. Must be a full member for a minimal 
        of 2 months and understand the guild charter, code of conduct, raiding 
        policies and guild goals/direction.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">2. Must be an active, vocal member in the 
        sense of you are current on the boards everyday and be willing to voice 
        thoughts and opinions on issues in a constructive way. Both in and out 
        of Gsay.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">3. Must be willing to realize being an 
        officer you are subject to critism of the guild and realize that you need 
        to handle it with a cool hand. Read between the lines and work constructively 
        with the persons issues.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">4. Realize that being an officer is much 
        more than in game. Its reading boards, reading quests, studying zones 
        and mobs. And the in game part meaning that you have to be available to 
        talk with members when needed.</font><br>
        <br>
        <font face="Georgia" size="3">5. Can be fully trusted with guild money 
        and spells.<br>
        <br>
        6. Can be fully trusted to not abuse his/her officer status/powers and 
        game commands. (ie detag someone because you don&#146;t care for them 
        or before following proper proticol) <br>
        <br>
        7. <i><b><font color="#FF0000">Watch the boards EVERYDAY and throw your 
        2cp in on issues.<br>
        </font></b></i><br>
        8. Be willing to handle difficult issues for example, diciplinary action 
        on an initiate or member, a member that has a conflict with another, a 
        member with a complaint or about to detag. And while dealing with these 
        issues remain objective, calm and logical. But also sympathetic when needed. 
        Basically&#133;you are a crisis manager.<br>
        <br>
        9. Be willing to negotiate, we don&#146;t always agree but sometimes it&#146;s 
        a compromise. Be willing to say even though I think my idea was the right 
        way but I was outvoted so will follow what has been set.<br>
        <br>
        10. Be in officers channel at all times during in game time. </font> </p>
