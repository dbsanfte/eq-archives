<div class="Center" style="font-size: 20pt; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 20px">Code of Conduct and Enforcement</div>
<div style="text-align: justify">The originators of this guild bore a close bond of friendship when they chose to establish this guild "Forsaken Circle". Many had existed together within this realm for many a Norrathian Sun. The name bears great pride amongst the progenitors of  Forsaken Circle.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 12px">If someone amongst the brethren (your sponsor)  determines that you are worthy to wear the mantle of  Forsaken Circle, then it is your duty to uphold the high principles of the guild out of respect for your sponsor, your fellow guildmates and ultimately yourself. PLEASE do not take this responsibility lightly.</div>
<div style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 12px; text-decoration: underline">Honor</div>
<div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 12px">When you become a member of Forsaken Circle you have joined a network of individuals that are willing to support you in many ways. Whether this support is the Cleric that will rez your lifeless body, or the druid or wizard, who will port you to the destination you are heading, or even the individual that will suggest the appropriate equipment you should have for your respective age, you will find no shortage of people willing to help you in this guild. Of course this same respect is expected from you also. You are expected to support your brethren in any way that is feasible.</div>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Remember the Golden Rule…<br />
Thank those that make an effort to help you!<br />
If someone can't lend a hand at that exact minute, respect that fact. Support classes are entitled to play the game too!<br />
If someone makes a mistake, don't chastise them! Encourage them to do better the next time.<br />
If you have a knowledge that can help another member, tell them in a way that won't demean them.</li> 
<li>Protect the name of the guild and its members.</li> 
<li>Use appropriate language, don't spew off expletives in /ooc, /shout or /guildsay.</li> 
<li>Prejudice, whether by race, creed or sexual disposition will not be tolerated.</li> 
<li>If you have a disagreement with another individual whether a guild-mate or not try to resolve the problem. If you are incapable of doing so, contact an officer and let them intercede. Try not to harbor resentment.</li> 
</ol>
<div style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 12px; text-decoration: underline">Loot</div>
<div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 12px">This is frequently a point of contention among players of this game.  Amongst guild members the preferred form of looting within groups is auto-splitting pp/Need before Greed/random 0-100 rolls on specific items. Other styles of looting will be tolerated as long as a) loot rules are established at the beginning and b) everyone who enters the group understands the rules.</div>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Ninja-looting will not be tolerated. People who are accused of this will be approached by an officer and the situation will be investigated. The offender will be dealt with accordingly which might lead to immediate removal from the guild.</li> 
<li>When grouped with non-guild members it is expected that you a) determine what the loot rules are as you enter the group b) abide by the loot rules established therein. Failure to do so may lead to your ultimate dismissal from the guild.</li> 
<li>Be careful looting NO DROP or NO RENT items that the players capable of looting get a chance to. If you don't know what class an item's for… Ask!</li> 
</ol>
<div style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 12px; text-decoration: underline">Guild Possessions</div>
<div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 12px">At times, if you are deemed worthy, you may be given an item from a higher level player that he can no longer use.  It is wrong for you to now assume that this possession is yours to do with as you see fit. You should not take advantage of this act of benevolence. When the time comes that this item is no longer usable by yourself than we ask you to do one of two things before attempting to sell the item. a) Contact the individual who gave the item to you and ask if they would like it back or b) Pass the item down to another guild member whose gameplay would be enhanced by the possession of the item.</div>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Do not expect hand-outs - If someone is gracious enough to give you an item you can use… then express your appreciation to them. But never expect players of higher levels than you to camp or give you items numerous levels above your means.  You will feel a greater sense of accomplishment earning your weapons and armor.</li> 
</ol>
<div style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 12px; text-decoration: underline">Enforcement</div>
<div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 12px">Sometimes it becomes necessary to ask a member to leave the guild because of some of the aforementioned guidelines or perhaps other reasons not specified. Here is the procedure that will be followed to ensure that the situation was treated with the utmost fairness.</div>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li><span style="font-weight: bold">Warning</span> - Under normal circumstances the person will be spoken to by an officer and advised that repeated behavior of this kind is not acceptable and may lead to his deguilding if not rectified. The sponsor of the accused will also be made aware of this warning.</li> 
<li><span style="font-weight: bold">Removal of Guildtag</span> - Depending on the situation the accused may be asked either to go /anon or remove his guildtag until a hearing by the officers can be arranged.</li> 
<li><span style="font-weight: bold">Officers' Meeting</span> - The officers will then review the information and determine whether a deguilding is merited. No less than 75% percent of the officers need to be in attendance for this meeting. A majority vote is necessary to deguild someone.</li> 
<li><span style="font-weight: bold">Defense Hearing</span> - The accused is entitled to a hearing to explain his side of the story to a gathering of officers. This step is only necessary if the accused requests it. Again, at least 75% of the officers need to be in attendance and the accused's sponsor is also asked to attend. A vote will be taken by the officers after all parties have had a chance to speak.  Again a majority vote is required to deguild. This meeting will be held in a private chat room.</li> 
<li><span style="font-weight: bold">Explanation</span> - A short explanation of why an individual was deguilded will be posted in the Member's Only forum. Out of respect for the departing party little information will be given on the incident in the Forums. If more specific information is desired a tell may be sent to one of the officers. It will be their discretion how much information they choose to give out. Please respect this decision.</li>
