        <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We represent 
          all classes and races in Norrath and we honor uniqueness that exists 
          in our world. All who are worthy and willing to serve a cause greater 
          than their own are welcome. Fellowship and cooperation are the goals 
          of our group. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe 
          that only by harnessing the special gifts and talents of all the people 
          on Norrath can we truly achieve our goals. To be a member of our cause 
          you need only vow to always treat others with respect and dignity. Only 
          by working together can we achieve the individual and collective goals 
          of our race, class and guild. No one class is superior to all others 
          and no individual's goals are more significant than another. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We work 
          together to help each other in these pursuits even when the ultimate 
          goal does not serve our own needs. If you feel that you share in these 
          ideals we will embrace you as one of our own and welcome your participation 
          in our cause. </font></p>
