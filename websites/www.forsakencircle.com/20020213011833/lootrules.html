<div class="Center" style="font-size: 20pt; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 20px">Forsaken
  Circle Raid Loot Policy</div>
<div style="text-align: justify">Items that are dropped on a raid will be
  awarded by the Loot Master to the appropriate class based on a “Best for the
  Guild” concept. All droppable and non-expendable items are property of the
  guild.<br>
</div>
<p><b><font size="2"><u>AWARD</u></font></b><br>
When a droppable non-expendable item is awarded to a guild member, it is theirs
to use until they obtain a better item from the guild. At that time the item
will be returned to the guild bank. Items returned to the guild bank may be
awarded to another guild member or sold as seen fit by the guild officers. If a
guild member chooses to leave Forsaken Circle, all awarded droppable
non-expendable items will be returned to the guild bank.<br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="2">LOOT MASTER</font></u></b><br>
A Loot Master will chosen by the Raid Leader at the time a raid is posted on the
guild message board. Loot Master duties will be rotated amongst guild officers
from raid to raid. The Loot Master will be familiar with both the guild members
needs and items that may drop in the zone being raided. It will be the
responsibility of guild members to post on the message board equipment and item
needs.<br>
</p>
<p>When item drops are found, the Loot Master will decide what class or classes
qualify for the item. The Loot Master will then review guild needs and offer the
item to the person of that class category who will benefit the guild the most.
The person accepting the item will then be removed from drop rotation until
everyone in that class category has received an item. One exception to this will
be breastplates/robes due to their stat value and rarity. Breastplates/robes
will be rewarded to the person on raid who will benefit the guild the most for
the class even if they have received a prior drop.<br>
<br>
If there is a conflict of interest when an item drops (i.e. the Loot master
feels she should receive the item), the Loot master will /tell the Raid Leader;
/ooc Conflict; and let the Raid leader make the decision on whom the item will
be awarded to.<br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="2">BEST FOR THE GUILD</font></u></b><br>
This policy is created to both reward members for longevity and activity in the
guild. We strive to all work together to do bigger and better things and the
only way we can all ensure this is by having a guild that works together as a
team. We feel it is important to not just be in the guild but to take an active
roll. So for this reason we have created a policy that works towards both of
these goals. It is best for the guild to reward players that have gained
sufficient levels to allow guild raids to happen, as well as reward players for
loyalty and time spent helping the guild progress as a whole.<br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="2">LOOT DISBURSEMENT DURING RAIDS</font></u></b><br>
All groups will be assigned a group leader. This person will be responsible and
only them for looting all kills accredited to the group. They will be
responsible for calling out in /ooc what was found on the mob or /ooc “Coin”
if is only gems or currency.<br>
<br>
Any currency, gems that are not reagents, or unclaimed tradable items will go to
guild bank and follow the policies mentioned on guild bank rules. Again this is
to fund future raids and expenses of clerics and chanters on raids.<br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="2">QUEST DROPS</font></u></b><br>
Quest drops will work a bit differently for reasons that a person may be more in
need of the item over another. Some quests have level limitations (ie paladin
books from Vox and Naggy) and stage a person is at in a quest is also a factor.
We will evaluate quest drops based on can the person use the item now that is
being quested (ie quest spell or epic) and if the person is actively working on
the quest and what stage they are at. If we have 2 people of same level and same
stage in quest the item will go to the person who will benefit the guild the
most, quest loots do not affect equipment/weapon rotations.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="2">GUESTS ON RAIDS</font></u></b><br>
The officers MUST first approve any guest. There may be times when in order to
even do the raid we have to invite people of different guilds (or friends of FC)
to fill these gaps in order for the raid to happen. In this case we will treat
the guest with the same considerations as noted above, how often they assist FC
in raids, current equipment and character level. This applies to any weapons or
armor drops other than Robes Breastplates and quest items.&nbsp;</p>
<p> Quest drops as well as planar
BP’s and Robes will always go to guild members first even if that guild member
has received a prior item and guest has not. If there is no guild member present
from the class or guild member already has the BP/Robe/Quest item it will be given to the guest
that can best use the BP/Robe/quest drop based on above loot policy.<br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="2">IN CLOSING</font></u></b><br>
We pride ourselves on our need before greed values as a guild. We know that
while any loot policy will not be liked by all we feel this is the most fair to
individuals as well as helping the guild advance in their goals. We are in this
together to help each other strive and grow and by working together and helping
one another one day at a time we shall meet our goals as friends. The true way
to succeed as a guild is to always support each other and work together. While we may
not be the fastest to get there we will find the victories all the more sweet
working together as a family to achieve them.</p>
<p><b>Sincerely,</b></p>
