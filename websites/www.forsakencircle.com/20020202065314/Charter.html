<div style="text-align: justify">Greetings! Forsaken Circle welcomes you. We represent all classes and races in Norrath and we honor uniqueness that exists in our world. All who are worthy and willing to serve a cause greater than their own are welcome. Fellowship and cooperation are the goals of our group. We believe that only by harnessing the special gifts and talents of all the people on Norrath can we truly achieve our goals. To be a member of our cause you need only vow to always treat others with respect and dignity. Only by working together can we achieve the individual and collective goals of our race, class and guild. No one class is superior to all others and no individual's goals are more significant than another. We work together to help each other in these pursuits even when the ultimate goal does not serve our own needs. If you feel that you share in these ideals we will embrace you as one of our own and welcome your participation in our cause. Should you decide that you would like to become a member of Forsaken Circle you must first know the policies that govern membership in our order.</div>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman">
<li>Always treat others with respect and dignity.</li> 
<li>Never under any conditions beg or harass anyone else for anything.</li> 
<li>Guild membership is a privilege, not a right. Do not abuse the generosity of your fellow guild members.</li> 
<li>Misrepresentation of Forsaken Circle will not be tolerated and conduct unbecoming will be dealt with swiftly and severely.</li> 
<li>Try to group with your fellow guild members as much as possible. Get to know them. This is not a rule but rather a suggestion. If you don't interact how will you find people to help you with your quests?</li> 
<li>Respect the beliefs of all members of the guild. Diversity is the essence of character. Nobody wants a world of clones. Individuality brings strength to our cause.</li>
</ol>
<div>Godspeed to you all and we welcome you to Forsaken Circle. We look forward to seeing you in the world of EverQuest.</div>
