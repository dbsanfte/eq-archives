  <p align=center><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">Jagged Pine Armor - 
  Circlet</font></b></p><p><font face="Arial">You say, 'I wish to acquire a 
  circlet' <br>
  <br>
  Cheyloh Greenwood nods softly, 'Then you shall endeavor to earn them, my 
  friend. Nature will provide to you what it is you provide to her -- if you 
  protect her, she shall in-turn offer shelter and provide to you. I shall aid 
  you, as is my duty here, but you must set out on your own before my aid can be 
  granted. There are two items you must seek; a Polished Jade Tear that resides 
  in the clutches of Lameriae the Alluring, a powerful Potameid Temptress who 
  seduced and killed on of the Blackguard's most cunning of thieves and hunters. 
  It is said that she holds the tear, which was given to her by the entranced 
  Blackguard before he drowned to death. The second item you must retrieve for 
  me is a Shadowjade Circlet that Jhaya Wyndrunner in Surefall Glade will aid 
  you to acquire -- all you need to do approach and ask her.' <br>
  <br>
  Jhaya Wyndrunner is on the the side of the druid's guild opposite to her 
  brother Lerian in surefall glade. <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what shadowjade circlet?' <br>
  <br>
  Jhaya Wyndrunner says 'I see that Cheyloh has been keeping herself quite busy 
  with the recent opening of our lands to Qeynos, and I am pleased to know that 
  our brethren of the world beyond the Jaggedpine have an interest in our ways. 
  I will aid you to create the circlet, but I must ask that you brave the wilds 
  and turmoil of this world to retrieve two items that I will then weave into 
  the circlet for you. The items I need are a Shadowjade Weave, which you will 
  make with your own hands by weaving two Shadowjade Vines and two strands of 
  Shadowjade Moss together -- both components you may find by foraging through 
  the Jaggedpine forest. Be sure that your mastery of tailoring is up to par 
  when attempting this feat, for the components are delicate and will be 
  destroyed in the hands of the inexperienced. The second item I am in need of 
  is a [Blackened Mithril Chain].'' <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what blackened mithril chain?' <br>
  <br>
  Jhaya Wyndrunner says 'The artisans of Qeynos have provided a wonderful 
  counterpart to our natural, although nearly depleted resource that was once 
  used when making this line of our sacred armor. Unfortunately, the one who 
  last attempted to retrieve the chain was killed in Lavastorm by one of the 
  poachers, who seek the Blackened Mithril for their own reasons -- likely to 
  steal our recipe and sell the corrupted versions of these treasured items on 
  the underground market of Norrath. In any case, we have heard that the chain 
  was sold to one appropriately named Nyuae the Cruel -- a Teir'Dal enchantress. 
  What her motives are, I am unsure of, but we do know that she has taken refuge 
  in the Ocean of Tears. Retrieve the Blackened Mithril Chain and return it to 
  me with the Shadowjade Weave.'' <br>
  <br>
  Nyuae the Cruel is in the ocean of tears on the dinosaur island. She's also 
  light blue to 60, a necromancer and immune to root/snare. </font></p><p>
  <font face="Arial">The shadowjade weave requires 2 shadowjade moss and 2 
  shadowjade fern leaves combined in a large sewing kit, not trivial at 165 
  skill. Handing the shadowjade weave and blackened mithril chain to Jhaya 
  results in a Shadowjade Circlet (5ac, 10hp, 10mana).</font></p><p>
