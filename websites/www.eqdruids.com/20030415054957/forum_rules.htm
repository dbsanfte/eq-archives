Guidelines for these forums, Please read before you post! &nbsp;These guidelines apply to all forums present in this community:
<hr size=1>
<ol>
<li><b>Please post your topic in the correct forum.</b>
<br><br>
Don't get upset if we move your topic to a more appropriate forum.  Posting your topic in the correct forum will facilitate quicker and easier searching.
<br><br>
<li><b>Please try not to start multiple threads on an existing topic (such as a patch message).  Try to use the search feature wherever possible.</b>
<br><br>
The threads may be closed to consolidate topics.  This is to "centralize" the information, as well as save a little bit on ezboard costs.
<br><br>
If you have an "everyday" question concerning spells, hunting grounds, methods of making money, equipment, etc., try to use the search feature to locate existing topics related to your question.
<br><br>
<li><b>Personal attacks, flames, abuse, racial slurs, or threats made towards other members will NOT be tolerated.  Debate opinions, not the people behind them.</b>
<br><br>
The offending post will be edited, may be removed, or the thread may be locked entirely, even if the posts are "in jest" or "for fun".  A reminder of this guideline will be issued within the post or the thread.  If the member(s) continues after the reminder has been issued, their posting privileges on this message board will be revoked.
<br><br>
<li><b>Watch your language.</b>
<br><br>
EQDruids is visited by people of all ages and backgrounds, so please keep it clean.  This includes sexual references, religious swear words, non-English swear words and any other content deemed inappropriate by the administrator or his moderators.
<br><br>
The profanity filter for this message board is <b>on</b>.  Please try to refrain from circumventing this filter by using symbols (such as $ for "s"), special characters, or alternate spellings.
<br><br>
<li><b>Posts specifically using inflammatory comments, or "flames" as the main topic of discussion will be closed, or removed entirely.</b>
<br><br>
<li><b>When linking several image files within posts, or a large (size) image file, please include an "image-intensive" warning in the subject of the post.</b>
<br><br>
Alternatively, create links ([link][/link]) to the images instead of linking them directly within the post ([image][/image]).
<br><br>
Remember that not all members have high-speed connections.  For several members, this service is not available in their area and they are using 56K (or lower) dial-up connections.  No one likes to wait more than 10 seconds for a page to finish loading, so please try to be considerate.
<br><br>
<li><b>If you don't like something Sony has done with EverQuest and can not come up with anything more original than "Sony Sucks" or the like, your post will be removed.</b>
<br><br>
The offending post will be edited.  Should the member persist, their posting privileges will be revoked.
<br><br>
<li><b>Do NOT start topics asking other members to join in a "petition".</b>
<br><br>
EQDruids will <u>NOT</u> support any message board petition, movement, or crusade.  Past experience has shown us that this is not the most effective method of getting an idea or concern to Sony or the game developers.
<br><br>
You may <u>NOT</u> include a link to your topic within any written or email correspondence to Sony or the game developers.
<br><br>
We will, however, support your wish to post your opinions or concerns here.  Should you wish to ask for support from the community members, you can do so by including in the body of the topic a request to send the party in question a written letter or email expressing their concerns.
<br><br>
<li><b>Thread "bumping" (for the purposes of spamming, increasing post count, gaining attention, or general annoyance) is not condoned.</b>
<br><br>
The post may be removed or thread may be closed.
<br><br>
We recognize that new members, or returning members, may be attempting to "catch-up" with all new topics that they have not read yet.  While this is acceptable, please try to be considerate of other members when replying or editing very old topics.
<br><br>
<li><b>Posts, of which the primary purpose is to rant about individual in-game players or guilds as being kill-stealers, exploiters, or other accusations, are considered inappropriate for this message board.</b>
<br><br>
The topic in question will be edited, moved to the Rants forum and closed.  These arguments are always one person's version of the 
occurrence versus another person's version and are always better handled on your server or guild message board.
<br><br>
<li><b>Topics with the sole purpose of "bashing" other classes will be closed and moved to the Rants forum.</b>
<br><br>
These threads serve no purpose other than to stir up trouble and further tarnish the reputation of the druid community.
<br><br>
<li><b>NO malicious code will be allowed in any post or custom signature.</b>
<br><br>
This includes any code that can cause a disruption of the forum, website or any community members' computer.  Breaking this rule will result in immediate  banning from the message board.
<br><br>
<li><b>When posting "adult-oriented" or "R-Rated" material, please add a warning to minors within the subject header or the body of the post.</b>
<br><br>
If posting material that is not "work-safe", add this warning to the topic as well.
<br><br>
<li><b>Do NOT link sites with pornographic or inappropriate content.</b>
<br><br>
Do not post, or link, pornographic or inappropriate pictures.  Do not link pornographic or inappropriate sites.  Try not to link to sites that use banner ads to other pornographic sites.
<br><br>
<li><b>Try to be considerate when linking to sites with several pop-up ads.</b>
<br><br>
Pop-up ads are very annoying and can cause havoc with a members' browser or computer.  Try to avoid linking to sites with several pop-up ads.
<br><br>
If you must link to such a site, please be considerate and include a warning in the subject or body of the topic.  Your post may be edited otherwise.
<br><br>
<li><b>Do NOT use the message board for advertising purposes.</b>
<br><br>
The offending post will be edited and a warning will be issued.  Should the member continue, their posting privileges will be revoked.
<br><br>
This includes all redirecting links to sites deemed inappropriate by this community, regardless of whether the site is membership, pay, or free.  This also includes blatant, "in-your-face" text messages telling members to visit an inappropriate site.
<br><br>
This guideline also applies to blatant or deceptive advertisements (banners, images, or redirecting links) contained within custom signatures to said sites.
<br><br>
If you have an EverQuest-related (or non-EQ related) site that you wish to have linked, contact Spiritual via the email address below, and we will add it to the main link page if we deem it relevant and appropriate.
<br><br>
<li><b>Do NOT spam the message board.</b>
<br><br>
The post(s), or thread(s), will be edited and closed, or deleted immediately, and the user will be  banned from the message board.
<br><br>
This includes "eBay" type posts, (involving the exchange of virtual (or real) items, coin or characters for money), advertisements (banners, images, and links), and "nonsense" or "irrelevant" posts (to increase post count or for general annoyance).
<br><br>
<li><b>Custom Signatures</b>
<br><br>
We take pride and enjoyment in the variety of wonderful signatures that people have created.  However, the ability to post your custom signature is a privilege, not a right.
<br><br>
This particular set of guidelines is NOT set in stone, but please be courteous 
and try to use common sense with your signatures (i.e. don't use a signature that takes up half the browser window).
<br><br>
 - Try to keep your custom signature images to 75kb or smaller (see guidelines on images)<br>
 - No ads (see guidelines on advertising)<br>
 - No inappropriate content or images<br>
 - No malicious code
<br><br>
<li><b>The adminstrator (Spiritual) and his moderators are the final word on any issue that arises on this forum.</b>
<br><br>
If you have a concern over an issue you can contact us at the email addresses below.  We will always listen to your concerns, but the final decision on an issue will be made by the administrator and his moderators.
<br><br>
Please be aware that these guidelines may be adjusted from time to time, more may be added, or some may be removed based on the requirements of the community at the time.
<br><br>

<li><b>When in doubt, see 19, or we'll sick the Attack Halfer on you!</b>
