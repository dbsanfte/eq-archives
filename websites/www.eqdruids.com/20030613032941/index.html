        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">June 11, 2003 3:00 am <br>
        <normal>------------------------------</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>** Experience System Change - Grouping **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>We've made some improvements to the way experience is rewarded 
        in EverQuest. These improvements are aimed at positively reinforcing the 
        act of grouping. After all, this is a Massively Multiplayer game.</normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>Prior to this update groups gained a 2% to 20% experience bonus 
        for having two to six members.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>As of today this bonus has increased to range from 20% to 80% 
        for having two to five members. When a group adds a sixth member, the 
        80% bonus remains, but the experience gained is only divided by 5 before 
        being distributed. The sixth group member no longer causes the 
        experience gain to be divided by 6.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>Planes of Power zones had an increased experience award above 
        and beyond those of most other zones. Because of these new dramatic 
        improvements to group experience gains, we will be reducing the 
        zone-specific experience bonus for Planes of Power zones a bit. As long 
        as character is grouped with at least one other in these zones, they 
        will see an improvement in experience gain over the old system. The one 
        down side to the new system is that there will be a small decrease in 
        experience for those who do not group, and only for those who do so in 
        Planes of Power zones.</normal> <br>
        <normal />
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>** Experience System Change - Level 60+ **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>In addition to the above changes, we have increased the range of 
        NPC levels that give a character experience after they reach level 60. 
        This will open up many of the &quot;old world&quot; zones to players previously 
        restricted to Planes of Power zones for experience gain. The range of 
        NPCs that will be &quot;blue&quot; to a level 65 character has been increased as 
        far as level 50, with the &quot;light blue&quot; range extending to level 45. The 
        best experience gains, however, are still for fighting things around and 
        above your level. This should open up areas for high level characters in 
        groups and solo.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal />
        <normal>** Interface **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Shared Bank Vault - We've added two shared bank slots to the 
        interface. These extra bank slots can be accessed by any character on 
        the same account and server. No-Drop and No Rent items can't be placed 
        in these bank slots, and only one of any specific Lore item can exist in 
        the shared bank at any time.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Spell Context Menus - This is a new interface menu that will 
        make memorizing spells less tedious. To access the spell menu, just 
        right-click an empty spell gem. This will open a list of spell 
        categories. Point your mouse at a category and a list of spells will be 
        displayed. Select a spell from that list to memorize it in that slot. 
        Your character will sit down, memorize the spell and stand back up.</normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Spell Favorites - Spell favorites are an easy way to memorize 
        a full set of eight spells without the tedious book searching. 
        Right-clicking on the spellbook icon in your spell window will open up 
        the spell favorites menu. You will be able to save your current spell 
        lineup as a favorite, delete a favorite or memorize all the spells in 
        one of your already saved spell sets. You can save as many as ten sets 
        of spell favorites. As with the new spell context menus mentioned above, 
        this will not replace the spellbook, it is meant to make memorizing 
        large numbers of spells more convenient.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Spell Descriptions - We have expanded the spell description 
        window. Along with the information that has always been available, we 
        have added an explanation about what the spell does in general that 
        includes damage and duration when appropriate. You can see these new 
        descriptions by right-clicking and holding on the spell scroll, the 
        spell gem in your Spells window, or the spell icon in your spellbook.</normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- New Camera - We've added a new camera mode to the game. 
        Lovingly dubbed the EQ Cam, it uses the mouse wheel to allow you to zoom 
        away from your character into a &quot;chase&quot; camera. This only works from 
        first person mode (the default view). Using the mouse wheel you can 
        determine the distance of the camera from your character, or to zoom 
        back into first person mode. When in the chase mode, mouselook turns the 
        character and camera together and you can change the pitch of the camera 
        using the mouse.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- NPC Names - Many NPCs will be displaying additional titles to 
        make it clearer what their job is. For example, an NPC that sells 
        tailoring supplies may have the title [Tailor Supplies] under their 
        name. This will help folks find the proper merchant. It's analogous to 
        them hanging out their shingle.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Rare Character Select Crash - Using the arrow keys to try to 
        change the selected character at the character select screen when there 
        were no characters on the account was causing people to crash out of the 
        game. That's fixed now.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Guild Message of the Day - Using certain HTML codes when 
        setting up a Guild Message of the Day was causing all members of the 
        guild to crash. While this may have been amusing for pranks on your 
        guild, we still decided to fix it.</normal> <br>
        <normal />
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>** Spells **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Spell level limits now enforced - Some high level spells 
        cannot be cast on characters under a certain level. In the past a caster 
        could get around this level restriction when casting a group version of 
        a spell by targeting a higher level group member, and the spell would 
        take effect on the whole group, regardless of their level. That loophole 
        has been closed. We're sorry if you have grown accustomed to the system 
        working this way, but those level restrictions are important to the 
        integrity of lower level gameplay.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Incineration and Conglaciation of Bones - Both of these spells 
        should now crit and stack (when cast by different casters).</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Divine Intervention - This spell should now be reporting the 
        amount of healing it delivers.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Healing Messages - The target of a healing spell will now get 
        a message telling them the caster's name and the amount of healing they 
        receive.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Reporting Damage Over Time - Damage over Time (DoT) done to 
        NPCs will now be reported to the caster every time it does damage. These 
        messages can be filtered in the Options window.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Boon of the Garou - The level restriction for this spell has 
        been removed. We have also fixed a bug with the spell that would prevent 
        it from being cast on target that are not on a horse if the enchanter is 
        on horseback (spell still cannot affect those on horseback).</normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Wake of Karana - To improve the usefulness of this spell, we 
        have lowered the recast time from 90 seconds to 15 seconds.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Beastlord Warders - Beastlords will once again be able to 
        summon their warders in the Plane of Sky. Sorry for the delay in getting 
        this one fixed properly.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Familiars - Familiars will no longer attempt to equip items. 
        This was causing them to try to wear weapons inside their heads, which 
        probably isn't a good thing for them to do.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Spirit spell line - We have added +75 dexterity to the effects 
        of Spirit of Flame, Spirit of Rellic, and Spirit of Snow.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Spell stacking and blocking - Changed the following spell 
        lines to cause them to bounce off of each other. Each line should block 
        everything from the other line, but still be overwritten by spells of 
        the same line.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>Spiritual Strength</normal> <br>
        <normal>Spiritual Brawn</normal> <br>
        <normal>Spiritual Vigor</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>Strength of Tunare</normal> <br>
        <normal>Strength of Nature</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>Brell's Mountainous Barrier</normal> <br>
        <normal>Brell's Stalwart Shield</normal> <br>
        <normal>Brell's Steadfast Aegis</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Translocation spells - Fixed a bug with translocation spells. 
        If a second translocation spell was cast on a character before he had 
        accepted the first, both would fail.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Spell casting pets - In the past, pets were restricted to 
        casting spells of level 20 and below. We have given them access to 
        higher level spells. You may want to be careful with them until you get 
        used to their new abilities. </normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Drunken Riders - We fixed an odd bug that allowed people who 
        were extremely drunk to cast spells without mana cost while on a horse. 
        Yes, crazy bugs like that actually happen. :)</normal> <br>
        <normal />
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>** Zones **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Droga and Nurga - The mines of Nurga have been inhabited by 
        crafty Goblins and stolid Burynai for many long years, digging and 
        slaving away under the earth. It's time to shake them up! The redesign 
        for these zones are now on the Legends server, Stormhammer. The mines of 
        Nurga are a fun zone for characters of levels about 40 to 55. The Temple 
        of Droga accommodates characters around 50th to 65th level. Both zones 
        will have some new events and quest, while retaining the distinct feel 
        of the zones.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Veksar - Since the rediscovery of the lands of Kunark, there 
        have been rumors springing from the ancient lore of the Iksar. Most of 
        those rumors remain unfounded, as gaining access to the lore of the 
        insular Iksar is no easy task. One of the most persistent legends is 
        about a city that lies buried under the Lake of Ill Omen. That city was 
        called Veksar, and it is up to you to discover the tale of its fate.</normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Planes of Power access - Planes of Power has provided us with 
        valuable insight into the group and guild dynamics that are involved in 
        large scale games. The way that we had expected guilds to advance 
        through the story of Planes of Power has become a problem for some 
        guilds as some members have fallen behind and found it difficult to 
        catch up. Obviously this was not our intention. We want people to play 
        with their friends and guild mates.</normal> <br>
        </font>
        <normal></normal>
        <font face="Arial"><br>
        <normal>To correct this issue, we will be allowing characters to enter 
        the following Planes of Power zones by meeting a simple level 
        requirement:</normal> <br>
        </font>
        <normal></normal>
        <font face="Arial"><br>
        <normal>Level 55 and over</normal> <br>
        <normal>Plane of Storms</normal> <br>
        <normal>Plane of Torment</normal> <br>
        <normal>Plane of Valor</normal> <br>
        <normal>Crypt of Decay</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>Level 62 and over</normal> <br>
        <normal>Bastion of Thunder</normal> <br>
        <normal>Halls of Honor</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>Characters that don't meet the level requirement may still enter 
        these zones using the existing flags, and raids may still bring 
        additional unflagged or lower level characters with them. All other 
        planes with flag or story requirements for entry will still require 
        those flags, and those flags can still be obtained as they always have.</normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>This will make the majority of Planes of Power zones available 
        to characters over the minimum level, and will allow their guilds to 
        travel and adventure together in the planes. We understand that those 
        that have already earned the entry flags for these zones have put some 
        effort into that accomplishment. We will be giving a reward to those 
        that have done so, in the form of a nice Charm slot item and Alternate 
        Advancement points based on the number of planes you've gained access 
        to.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>The reward for planar progression will be available this week. 
        We found an issue with part of the reward on Test server, and are in the 
        process of fixing it. This is a top priority and we plan to bring it to 
        all live servers this week.</normal> <br>
        <normal />
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Great Divide - The Plane of Knowledge portal in the Great 
        Divide will now be available when the Ring War is in progress.</normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Bastion of Thunder - We have upgraded the loot available from 
        many of the mini-bosses in the Bastion of Thunder to make the reward 
        more inline with the risk.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Sol Ro's Tower - They look like frogs, hop like frogs and now 
        they even react to spells like frogs. Flame Frogs are now flagged as 
        animals.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Rallos Zek encounter - Rallos Zek will remove anyone from the 
        zone that attacks him if they are not part of the raid that has him 
        engaged. Even in war, there are rules to be followed.</normal> <br>
        <normal />
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>** Items **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Tradeskill item flag - There is a new flag on items. When 
        viewing the information about an item, if you see that it has a 
        Tradeskill flag, it is an item that can be used in a tradeskill recipe. 
        This isn't to clearly spell out every item that is used in every 
        tradeskill recipe. The intent is to assist those who are finding items 
        that do not already have an obvious use, by letting them know that the 
        item is used in a tradeskill recipe, somewhere.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- LoY &quot;Fine Steel&quot; - Many of the more commonly dropped weapons 
        in the Legacy of Ykesha zones were a bit too powerful for the ease and 
        level needed to get them. Some of the most out of line items were the 
        Harpoon, Luggald Trident, and Luggald Dagger. We've decided that it is 
        necessary to tune them down a bit.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- The Hollow Acrylia Obelisk - This is the old Acrylia key. It 
        has been changed into a charm. This charm can be used by anyone, not 
        just those that own LoY.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Bows - The Longbow of the Grimlings and the Bow of Gloaming 
        have both been given ranges. They can now be used properly.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- The Burning Flame Shield - This item had the wrong resist 
        modifiers. It now has a +30 fire resistance and a -10 cold resistance.</normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Bazaar Search - Non-instrument items with instrument modifiers 
        will now show up in instrument type searches in the Bazaar.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Ornate Stone Medicine Totem - This item can now be equipped.</normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Storm Reaper Thorn Machete - This newbie Halfling quest weapon 
        is now flagged as magical.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Charm of the Brotherhood - This item will now give a bonus 
        when grouped with others of either the same class or race.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Dagger of Distraction - This item can no longer be used by 
        Monks.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Edge of Eternity - Beastlords and monks can no longer use this 
        item.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Veil of Lost Hopes and Orb of Clinging Death - The casting 
        times on both of these items has been lowered.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Magi`Kot's Pants of Convergence - The effect on this item has 
        been changed to summon a Rod of Mystical Transvergance.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Cloak of the Falling Skies - The focus effect this item has 
        changed to Preservation of Solusek</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- The Wristguard of Keen Vision - This item is now useable by 
        int. casters.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- The Mask of Conceptual Energy - This item is now useable by 
        priests.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal />
        <normal>** Alternate Advancement **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Lifeburn - This ability would cause an undue amount of aggro 
        to be generated because it would bring the caster to an extremely low 
        number of hit points, making them look like tasty targets to enemies 
        nearby. To lessen this problem, Lifeburn will no longer reduce the 
        caster to 10 hit points, but to about one fourth of the caster's hit 
        points. This should prevent the additional agro generated while 
        retaining the risk for using the ability.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Feigned Minion - The Child of Bertoxxulous pet will no longer 
        cast buff spells to break his feign when under the Feigned Minion 
        effect.</normal> <br>
        <normal />
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>** Quests and Tradeskills **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Bankers - There were a few quests that required giving an item 
        to a banker. When we recently removed the ability for characters to give 
        items to bankers to help prevent mistakenly losing items, those quests 
        became unavailable. We have moved those quests to new NPCs. If you see 
        any other quests that ask you to give something to a banker, please use 
        /bug and report it to us.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Newly Stackable Items - Valor Crystals, Ceramic Linings, 
        Holgresh Fur and Casks are now stackable. Also, Valor Crystals can be 
        sold to vendors. </normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Sewer Catfish - These unappetizing fish have begun to appear 
        in Cabilis.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Klok Foob - Will now accept a Catfish Croak Sandwich.</normal>
        <br>
        <normal />
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>** Changes for New Characters **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Newbie Starting Locations - We've modified all locations where 
        new characters start to make them a bit more convenient for the new 
        player. They should all start very near their guild masters.</normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Nudging - New characters will be given a text message to 
        encourage them to hand in their newbie note to their guild master. For 
        new players, this is one of the key things to get them involved in 
        gameplay, and one of the easiest to overlook.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Guild Masters - To help guide new characters, Guild Masters 
        now take a more active role in helping out new recruits by directing 
        them to some starting points for quests.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Quests - There are even more quests in the newbie zones, most 
        of them revolving around the pests that seem to inhabit even the 
        grandest cities.</normal> <br>
        <normal />
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>** Miscellaneous **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- We are working on an update to the Luclin player character 
        model animations. This will not be a complete revamp of all the 
        animations, but will address some of the most common concerns. However, 
        in the mean time you may see some unusual animations, particularly when 
        shorter PCs are running.</normal> <br>
        <normal />
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>** UI File Changes **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>NOTE: In order to see the new Shared Bank slots, you will need 
        to use the default bank window, or modify your custom bank window to 
        include the new slots.</normal> <br>

        of their EQ product is outstanding. Their <i>EverQuest Player's Handbook</i>,
        <i>Game Master's Guide</i> and <i>Monsters of Norrath</i> are some of 
        the best source books I've ever seen for a roleplaying game. With the

        the world of Norrath for pen and paper gamers is growing. <br>

        And even if you aren't interested in these books as a pen and paper

          <br>
          The following was posted by his brother, whom has our deepest 
          sympathies. <br>
          <br>
          <b>I really don’t know how to write this, so forgive me if my post is 
          not as eloquent as it could be. I think the best way to write this is 
          to be direct. My name is James. The one you know as Makavelli is my 
          brother. Shane, Makavelli, passed away late Friday night. He came into 
          town to visit me for the weekend. Our first night out we got split up 
          at one of the bars and he apparently went out back to have a smoke. 
          This is where he came upon two guys taking turns beating a third one. 
          Shane went to intervene, but what he didn’t know was that one of the 
          guys had a gun. Shane was shot four times in the chest and ended up 
          dying before the ambulance even got there. The two guys that were 
          giving the beating took off and we still have gotten no word from the 
          police as to who they were. The third was able to get away as well. He 
          told the police that the two men had thought he was hitting on one of 
          their girlfriends. According to him they were going to shoot him in 
          that ally, but Shane arrived to take the bullets for him.</b> <br>
          <br>
          Shane was a great player, a great guy as well as a hero and 
          unfortunetly we won't ever be able to let him know that we'll always 
          view him as one. He will be greatly missed by his online family and 
          again, to all his friends, family, I offer my deepest condolenses and 
          as soon as I am able I will post an email address where anyone who 
          would like to, can send a message to the family. For now I have 
          started a thread in the message boards entitled Makavelie which I'm 
          sure the family will read.</font></p>

        adventuring in these zones without completely remaking the contents of 
        the zone. We plan to do several of these, and we'll keep you updated as 
        we move through these. We recently finished Veeshan's Peak, the Temple 
        of Droga and the mines of Nurga. Currently we are working on a partial

        in a group of other spells that some focus items affected. But the 
        nature of DoT spells is very different than other spells, and the affect 
        of these focus items on DoT spells was not what we wanted it to be. A 
        new class of focus items needs to be created to increase the effect of 
        DoT spells. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">4) Items in the Planes of Power
        </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">We will be looking at the quality of 
        Planes of Power item rewards and improving them where appropriate. Items 
        for many of the lower tier gods will be upgraded and more rare items and 
        NPCs will be added to the following zones as needed: </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Crypt of Decay <br>
        Plane of Torment <br>
        Halls of Honor <br>
        Plane of Tactics <br>
        Plane of Innovation <br>
        Bastion of Thunder </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">5) Class Balance </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">We're still planning to take a look 
        at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen 
        behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game. 
        Finding the proper solutions for this situation will take some time. 
        Some options being considered are:</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Improve melee damage-increasing 
        disciplines <br>
        Improve Planes of Power melee weapons </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Additionally, we're looking at the 
        concerns from players about their spells, and changing them where 
        appropriate. The goal here is to remove annoying issues with spells, not 
        necessarily to increase caster power overall. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">6) Shields and blocking </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">We're planning on reviewing the 
        possibility of giving an innate chance to block when using a shield. 
        We've been hoping to do this for a while, and it should be getting a 
        realistic review in the near future. We'd like to increase the value of 
        shields, and make it a worthwhile choice for players who might normally 
        dual-wield weapons or use a two-handed weapon. We plan on balancing this 
        against classes which use shields by default, and therefore wouldn't be 
        making any trade-offs to equip a shield. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">7) Tradeskills </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">We will be looking at the chance of 
        failure for tradeskill recipes. We are aware of the concerns of trades 
        folk in EverQuest, and it is on our schedule to review things such as 
        the fact that masters of trade skills can fail the easiest recipes. That 
        doesn't necessarily mean that we plan to change it, but we will most 
        certainly look it over - and probably will change it :) . </font></td>

        <td align=center valign="top">
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Here is the latest from EQLive:</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Upcoming for June 11th, 2003 </font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">It's been a fun month for the 
        EverQuest team. With the recent completion of Veksar and the redesigns 
        of Veeshan's Peak and the Plane of Hate receiving such a nice reaction 
        from the folks that have visited those zones, it's a pleasure for us to 
        be able to work on Droga and Nurga in the same way. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Seeing so many new faces on the Test 
        server recently has been a great. There's no doubt that we need as many 
        eyes on the complicated changes we make to the game as we can get. We 
        wanted to thank those of you that have taken the time to help us out by 
        logging into the Test server recently; you've been of great assistance 
        to us. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">And as players of EverQuest, one of 
        the most enjoyable things about working on the game is the opportunity 
        to add game features that we've always wanted to see. Many of them are 
        listed below. We think you'll like them as much as we do. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">1) <strong>Droga and Nurga revamp 
        coming to Legends.</strong> The mines of Nurga have been inhabited by 
        crafty Goblins and stolid Burynai for many long years, digging and 
        slaving away under the earth. It's time to shake them up! The redesign 
        for these zones will be on the Legends server, Stormhammer, with our 
        next update. The mines of Nurga will be a fun zone for characters of 
        levels about 40 to 50. The Temple of Droga will accommodate characters 
        around 50th to 60th level. Both zones will have some new events and 
        quest, while retaining the distinct feel of zones. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">2) <strong>Veksar moving to all Live 
        servers.</strong> Since the rediscovery of the lands of Kunark, there 
        have been rumors springing from the ancient lore of the Iksar. Most of 
        those rumors remain unfounded, as gaining access to the lore of the 
        insular Iksar is no easy task. One of the most persistent legends is 
        about a city that lies buried under the Lake of Ill Omen. That city was 
        called Veksar, and it is up to you to discover the tale of its fate.
        </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">3) <strong>Group experience bonus 
        increasing dramatically.</strong> We've been testing this on the Test 
        server for a few weeks, and some final tuning may be needed before it is 
        released. The goal is to dramatically improve the experience gained by 
        groups. The old group experience bonus ranged from 2% to 20% for a 6 
        person group. The new bonus will range from 20% to 80%. In addition, the 
        6th person added to a group will not count when experience is divided. 
        This means that in a group of 5 the total experience is divided by 5 
        then distributed to each member. A group of 6 will also only have the 
        total experience divided by 5 before it is distributed to each member. 
        Due to this large increase in group experience, we will be reducing the 
        experience modifier given in Planes of Power zones. Those zones had a 
        dramatic experience bonus. These zone-specific experience changes are 
        more than offset by the increased group bonus. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">4) <strong>Experience range increase 
        for characters above 60th level.</strong> This is another change that we 
        are testing and anticipate moving to the Live servers. It will open up 
        many of the &quot;old world&quot; zones to players previously restricted to Planes 
        of Power zones for experience gain. The range of NPCs that will be 
        &quot;blue&quot; to a level 65 character has increased as far as level 50, with 
        the &quot;light blue&quot; range extending to level 45. The best experience gains, 
        however, are still going to be for fighting things around and above your 
        level. This will open up areas for high level characters in groups and 
        solo. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">5) <strong>Shared bank vault will be 
        added.</strong> There are times when a player wants to trade items from 
        one character to another. In the past making such a trade may have 
        included dropping items on the ground or asking a friend to hold them 
        for you. To make such trades more convenient, we are adding two shared 
        bank slots to the interface. Any character on the same account and 
        server can access these extra bank slots. No-Drop items can't be placed 
        in these bank slots, and only one of any specific Lore item can exist in 
        the shared bank at any time. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">6) <strong>Planes of Power access 
        changes will be implemented.</strong> Planes of Power has provided us 
        with valuable insight into the group and guild dynamics that are 
        involved in large scale games. The way that we had expected guilds to 
        advance through the story of Planes of Power has become a problem for 
        some guilds as some members have fallen behind and found it difficult to 
        catch up. Obviously this was not our intention. We want people to play 
        with their friends and guild mates. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">To correct this issue, we will be 
        allowing characters to enter the following Planes of Power zones by 
        meeting a simple level requirement: </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><u>Level 55 and over</u> <br>
        Plane of Storms <br>
        Plane of Torment <br>
        Plane of Valor <br>
        Crypt of Decay </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><u>Level 62 and over</u> <br>
        Bastion of Thunder <br>
        Halls of Honor </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Characters that don't meet the level 
        requirement may still enter these zones using the existing flags, and 
        raids may still bring additional unflagged or lower level characters 
        with them. All other planes with flag or story requirements for entry 
        will still require those flags, and those flags can still be obtained as 
        they always have. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">This will make the majority of Planes 
        of Power zones available to characters over the minimum level, and will 
        allow their guilds to travel and adventure together in the planes. We 
        understand that those that have already earned the entry flags for these 
        zones have put some effort into that accomplishment. We will be giving a 
        reward to those that have done so, though you'll have to wait to see 
        what that reward is. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">7) <strong>Enhanced Spell 
        Descriptions added.</strong> Spell casters spend hours studying their 
        trade. It takes great mental effort to understand and master the 
        complicated arcana needed to cast even the simplest of spells. We have 
        added new information to the spell descriptions displayed in game. An 
        additional line of text explains what the spell does in general and 
        includes information such as damage and duration when appropriate.
        </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">8) <strong>A new method for 
        memorizing spells.</strong> There was a day when casters only needed 32 
        pages in their spell books, with only 5 spells per page. These days 
        spell books have 50 pages and 8 spells per page. Frankly, that's a lot 
        of spells. We've come up with a new method for finding and memorizing 
        spells that will make things easier for the overburdened spell caster. 
        Right-clicking an empty spell gem will open a list of spell categories. 
        Pointing your mouse at a category will display a list of spells. 
        Selecting a spell from that list will make your character sit down, 
        memorize the spell and stand back up. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">We know that many people are happy 
        with the existing spellbook system. Rest assured that the spellbook 
        isn't going anywhere. This new memorization system is an optional 
        convenience for those who wish to try out a new method of managing their 
        spells. The spellbook remains the only way to scribe new spells. </font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">9) <strong>Spell Favorites.</strong> 
        Spell favorites are an easy way to memorize a full set of eight spells 
        without the tedious book searching. Right-clicking on the spellbook icon 
        in your spell window will open up the spell favorites menu. You will be 
        able to save your current spell lineup as a favorite, delete a favorite 
        or memorize all the spells in one of your already saved spell sets. As 
        with the new spell context menus mentioned above, this will not replace 
        the spellbook, it is meant to make memorizing large numbers of spells 
        more convenient. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">10) <strong>Damage Over Time spell 
        messages.</strong> Damage over Time (DoT) spells cause a certain amount 
        of damage to the target at intervals. Currently, the caster of the spell 
        is only told about the damage done the first time the spell does damage. 
        All the other intervals were a mystery. What certainly sounds like an 
        easy feature to add required a bit of work, but after the next update 
        DoT spells will report their damage to the caster each time damage is 
        done. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">If the new messages get to be too 
        much for you, you can disable them in the Options window, much like any 
        other type of damage reporting. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">11) <strong>Improvements to the game 
        for new players.</strong> New players can be overwhelmed by all of the 
        items they find in the game (heck, so do those of us who have been 
        playing for a few years). To help reduce that confusion, we are adding a 
        Tradeskill tag to items that are used as components in trade skill 
        recipes. To help guide new characters, Guildmasters will take a more 
        active role in helping out new recruits by directing them to some 
        starting points for quests. There will be even more quests in the newbie 
        zones, most of them revolving around the pests that seem to inhabit even 
        the grandest cities. In addition, NPC merchants as well as other notable 
        folks will have a title that will explain what their jobs are. For 
        example, a baking supply merchant can be recognized as such by the 
        description beneath his name. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Also, as a heads up to players that 
        have created their own user interfaces for EverQuest, these are the 
        interface files that we expect to change next week. </font></p>
