  <b><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">You will need to obtain 
  the Di'Zok Signet of Service before proceeding with this quest. <br>
  <br>
  1. Talk to &quot;a goblin traitor&quot; (2-3 hour spawn) in Droga near the warder area 
  at 0, -175. <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'Hail, a goblin traitor' <br>
  <br>
  a goblin traitor says 'Serve the Sarnak do ya? You the one they say they send? 
  I don't know that I believe ya, show a token. Humm show me ya ring if ya got 
  it. ' <br>
  <br>
  You give a goblin traitor your Di`Zok Signet of Service. He hands it right 
  back to you. <br>
  <br>
  a goblin traitor looks relieved when he sees your signet of service and eyes 
  you with a bit more respect. ''Good! They tell'd me to wait here for ya, can't 
  say I like it but here I sits. Itbe good to be rid of Skargus though, so I be 
  a happy one, oh yes. Want to know the [plan] then?'' <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what's the plan?' <br>
  <br>
  a goblin traitor says 'Alrighty, listen listen. Skargus used to be a low 
  rankin' nogood. He made fake story 'bout Gragbar who was the warlord and 
  caused him much trouble with the chief. Gragbar was cast down, <br>
  chief made Skargus the warlord now. Gragbar is very angry, would take back his 
  position and kill Skargus if he get [evidence] of his treachery. ' <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what evidence?' <br>
  <br>
  a goblin traitor makes a terrible face, then spits on the ground before 
  continuing. ''Gragbar are workin' with the Iksar, bleh Iksar. He sellin' 
  goblin troops as slaves to Cabilis when he can, sayin' they died in battle at 
  the lake. If we get evidence of that, we get Skargus and kill him. You go to 
  Frontier mountains, find Sarnak there, he knows where we get evidence <br>
  from. Give him this note from me, and he help ya. Off with ya now, before I 
  get seen with ya.' <br>
  <br>
  He will give you a note. <br>
  <br>
  He is on Di'Zok faction so he is a good way to test your faction standing. <br>
  <br>
  2. Take this note to &quot;a sarnak spy&quot; in Frontier Mountains at 1880, 3600. <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'Hail, a Sarnak spy' - no reaction <br>
  <br>
  You give a Sarnak spy the note from a goblin traitor. <br>
  <br>
  A Sarnak spy reads the note slowly, turning it around in his claws a few times 
  before completing it. ''I see you spoke with that half-wit goblin! I hate hate 
  hate it when he sends me a note, his penmanship is almost <br>
  illegible. I hope he informed you of the situation, he's really not the most 
  dependable agent of Di'zok, and sadly his note doesn't really make much sense. 
  No <br>
  matter though, are you ready to [proceed] in this mission?'' <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'I am ready to proceed' <br>
  <br>
  A Sarnak spy says 'Good, here then is what you must do. It's pretty simple 
  actually and even one such as you should have no troubles. Skargus has been 
  trading in slaves with the Iksar. He has a courier there <br>
  visits the outskirts of Cabilis and sends weekly reports back to Droga. If we 
  could get that report, Skargus would be finished. Will you go to Cabilis and 
  [get the report]? ' <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'I will get the report' <br>
  <br>
  A Sarnak spy scowls at you, clearly unimpressed by your efforts. ''Of course 
  you'll go get the report fool, but do you think that the courier will just 
  give <br>
  it to you?'' The Sarnak shakes his head sadly. ''Okay, look. Go into Droga and 
  try to get a warlord's insignia off one of the goblins in there. Take this 
  forged note to the courier I've written out, along <br>
  with the insignia to Warslik's woods and give it to the courier. With luck, 
  he'll believe you work for Skargus and give you the report. If you get the 
  report, find Gragbar in Droga and give it to him .'' <br>
  <br>
  He will give you a forged note. <br>
  <br>
  3. Take this forged note to &quot;a shady goblin&quot; (24 hour spawn) in Warsilik Woods 
  near Cabilis at -1650, -1135 on the 2nd floor, along with a Drogan Warlord's 
  Insignia (random drop in Nurga and Droga). <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'Hail, a shady goblin' <br>
  <br>
  a shady goblin says 'If yer not my contact ya best be movin' on. Got no time 
  to waste on ya. ' <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'I am your contact' <br>
  <br>
  a shady goblin says 'Are ya? Hum, let me see yer insignia then, and the note 
  Skargus gave ya. ' <br>
  <br>
  You give a shady goblin the forged note and a Drogan Warlord's Insignia. <br>
  <br>
  a shady goblin gapes at the note in puzzlement, obviously a bit concerned by 
  it. The courier looks at the note for more than a minute, then looks at you, 
  and back at the note. ''Errm.. welp, dunno what to make of the note. If I know 
  the right of it, Skargus finally got him some girly to do his writin' for him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ooooh I bet she a tasty one, graarr. If I was warlord I know I'd have me a 
  girly too. Gah, take this report and get outta my sight. <br>
  <br>
  He will despawn and give you the report. <br>
  <br>
  4. Take this report to &quot;an angry goblin&quot; (3 day spawn with a 10% variance) in 
  Droga between the chief area and dining room at 150, 1950. <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'Hail, an angry goblin' <br>
  <br>
  an angry goblin ''Go away, my life is miserable enough!'' The angry goblin 
  looks at you more closely, his rage fading for a moment. ''Are you here with 
  the evidence I was promised? Give it to me if you have <br>
  it!!'' <br>
  <br>
  You give the report to an angry goblin. <br>
  <br>
  an angry goblin howls in triumph! 'This is just what I needed! Skargus is mine 
  now, wait until he finds out, just wait! His death is close at hand. Follow me 
  and <br>
  I'll take you to Skargus's chamber, you can wait there while I take this 
  report to the chief!' <br>
  <br>
  an angry goblin shouts 'I have you now Skargus, you traitor! Even now I'm 
  taking this report of slave-trading to the chief! Your days here are at an 
  end!' <br>
  <br>
  Warlord Skargus says 'I've gotta stop Gragbar before he turns in that report!'
  <br>
  <br>
  This will spawn Warlord Skargus (level 56 SK with a 1k HT). Kill Skargus and 
  loot the Head of Skargus. <br>
  <br>
  5. Take ring #1 and the head of Skargus back to Herald Telcha in Chardok. <br>
  <br>
  Herald Telcha says 'Ah hah! You are noteworthy indeed amongst the servants of 
  the Sarnak! Perhaps I should have you killed, before your deeds outdo mine.. 
  Hmm.. <br>
  Guards! Guards! Haha, do not panic menial being, in fact I am most impressed 
  with your service. Here is the ring I promised you in exchange for your 
  efforts.' <br>
  <br>
  The effect on the ring, Aegis of Bathezid, is a 25dmb Damage Shield, and lasts 
  25 minutes. <br>
  <br>
  The ring comes with 5 charges and is rechargeable by giving it back to Herald 
  Telcha as long as you keep your faction at ally. </span></b><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
