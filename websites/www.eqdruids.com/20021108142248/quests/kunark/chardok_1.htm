  <b><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">In order to get the 
  first ring, all you need is warmly faction and to have attained 51st level. 
  Sounds easy, but it will take the killing of over 3500 goblins in Droga to get 
  you warmly from KOS. <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'Hail, Herald Telcha' <br>
  <br>
  Herald Telcha says 'Hail to you, lesser being! It is good to see you seeking 
  the enlightenment and satisfaction that can only come from serving the Sarnak! 
  Experience for yourself the joy of fealty to our Lord the Overking Bathezid 
  Dizok! I am Telcha, <br>
  lesser apprentice sub-herald in training to the Court of Dizok and I stand 
  ready to welcome those who would serve our noble Overking. Are you here to 
  [aid] us? <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'I will aid the Sarnak' <br>
  <br>
  Herald Telcha says 'Ah, so good of you to strive to improve yourself! So often 
  members of your pathetic lesser races plod along in ignorance, unaware of the 
  most Noble empire of the Dizok. Enough though of the <br>
  chit-chat, as Im sure you are most eager to make yourself useful! Before you 
  may enter our worthy city and be looked upon as a valuable servant, you must 
  prove your worth to our [cause]. <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'What cause?' <br>
  <br>
  Herald Telcha says 'The first task I shall set you is the slaying of goblins! 
  Ooh, how very heroic you must feel to finally have a worthy goal guiding your 
  previously menial existance! Yes, go forth from here and journey to Droga, 
  stronghold of our enemies. Slay the warriors and menials of the Mountain Death 
  Clan, bring havoc to their homes. Return to me with proof of <br>
  your deeds, to raise in your standing with the Dizok. Bring me [tokens] of 
  many dead goblins, and one day you shall walk among us. <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'What tokens?' <br>
  <br>
  Herald Telcha says 'As proof of your deeds I shall require either 2 Mountain 
  Death mineral salts, or a patch of green goblin skin. Bring me many of these, 
  as <br>
  you bring destruction on the goblin city, and I shall speak to my superiors of 
  your efforts on our behalf. Do enough for our cause, and I shall reward you 
  directly. Return to me later and remind me that you <br>
  serve the Sarnak, and I may have a ring for you if you are worthy. <br>
  <br>
  Hand Herald Telcha a Green Goblin Skin: <br>
  <br>
  Herald Telcha says 'Green Goblin Skin! You have indeed been busy! I shall 
  speak to my masters of this, continue your good work and return to me with 
  more skins. <br>
  <br>
  You hand Herald Telcha two Mountain Death mineral salts: <br>
  <br>
  Herald Telcha says 'Ah, most excellent! You are sure to be more highly valued 
  as our servant once I speak to my masters of this! Mountain Death Mineral 
  Salts, they shall grace the Overkings table this very night! <br>
  Be off, minion! Fetch us some more salts to prove your value! <br>
  .......<br>
  You say to Herald Telcha, 'I serve the sarnak' <br>
  <br>
  At dubious faction: <br>
  Herald Telcha says 'Away with you! I am the herald of the Dizok Overking, here 
  to greet the servants of my master. If you would walk within our city, go 
  forth and prove yourself our ally by slaying our goblin enemies! Advance into 
  our city at your own peril, as <br>
  our soldiers regard you as a foe! <br>
  <br>
  At kindly faction: <br>
  Herald Telcha says 'You have not yet done enough service for the Sarnak 
  Collective, and my Dizok Masters. Return to me when you have done more, and I 
  may reward you with a ring of service.' <br>
  <br>
  At warmly faction, below level 50: <br>
  Herald Telcha says 'What to do, what to do.. You've served the Di'zok well, 
  young one but you are not yet experienced enough to wear the Signet of the 
  Di'zok. Come back when you've seen a bit more of the world, and the ring shall 
  be yours. <br>
  <br>
  At warmly faction, above level 50 (To get the ring): <br>
  You say, 'I serve the sarnak' <br>
  <br>
  Herald Telcha says 'Indeed you do my friend, indeed you do! Walk among us in 
  safety, wear this ring as a symbol of your service to our cause. Continue your 
  efforts in our war on the goblins, and your rewards shall increase. Return to 
  me your ring, along with the head of the Drogan Warlord Skargus, and I'll give 
  you an even greater badge of honor. Good day to you, servant of the Sarnak. '
