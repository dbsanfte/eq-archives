<p align="justify"><b><font size="2">Hail Fellow Druids.</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font size="2">During my travels through Norrath, I have discovered a nice little way to get
rapid experience. I have seen few others use this technique, and the ones that
see me use it often wonder why they didn't think of it themselves. So for those
of you unfamiliar with this method, I would like to share it with you.</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font size="2">At lvl 34, druids get this wonderful little spell called LIGHTNING STRIKE.
It's an area effect spell that does 184 pts of damage, hitting up to 4 targets
MAXIMUM at once. This is a wonderful time saver, as you have already gone
through the first hell lvl at level 30, and at 35 you are on your second one,
3rd at 40, and the ever popular, &quot;This lvl makes me want to quit the
game&quot;, at 45.</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font size="2">The key to using this spell effectively is making sure that all of the
targets are grouped fairly close together. This is rather simple to do if you
remain patient and don't get to cocky. Here are some of the various ways i have
experimented doing this....</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font size="2">1) Assuming the targets are side by side, harmony them and pull one with
snare. Get him far enough away from the other so you can go back to the one
still sitting there and then pull him with snare. Then run circles around them
both until they are close together, then kite away.</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font size="2">2) Say you have a target at 9:00 and 3:00. Get within casting distance of
both if possible. Target the first and pull with snare. Then turn and do the
same with the second. As they advance on you, slowly walk backwards keeping them
and yourself in a &quot;V&quot; type formation. With them at the tips of the
&quot;V&quot; and you at the intersection where the lines meet. As they draw
closer to you they will close the distance between themselves. Once they are
close enough together, Kite away.</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font size="2">3) This is another good way. Especially for those who may not have enough
mana to kite more than one mob efficiently. (Best used with the &quot;V&quot;
formation example above) Once you have meditated to full, cast regenerate on
yourself. Then med back up to full mana. Then cast your second damage shield on
yourself. *always keep the self only version buff on*) then either med to full
again, or pull if you are ready. Let both targets close in on you and hit you a
couple of times. This has 2 advantages. a) Gets both targets side by side. b)
Does a little bit of damage to each that may save you having to cast a last DD
spell on them.</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font size="2">There are lots of other ways to do this. You should experiment and find
whatever method works best for you. Also, I believe it goes without saying that
this only works outdoors for the most room for kiting. Not to mention that
Lightning Strike is an outdoor only spell.</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font size="2">I have used this on only a couple of different mobs. Gnolls outside of
Splitpaw, Cyclops, Hill Giants, and various Guards.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font size="2">Some things to keep in mind using this method...</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font size="2">* Always keep the targets close together. IF they get separated during the
fight, stand directly in the center of the 2 and slowly back away as the get
closer. this will draw them back together. If you are kiting more than 2 and
this happens, draw 2 of them together, the repeat the process above to get the
3rd back in the group.</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font size="2">* Lightning Strike takes a lot of mana to cast, and is not really mana
efficient for the damage it does. For best mana \ damage efficiency you will
need 3 or more targets.</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font size="2">* Before you get all gung ho and go trying to kill 4 mobs at once, try this
out on a single target first. See how much mana it will take you to kill it, and
how much you have left over. IF you have to med to much during the battle, it
might be best to wait for your next lvl, or until you get another good WIS
increasing item.</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font size="2">* Also keep in mind that just because you can kill 2 at a time, does not mean
that you can take 3 or 4 effectively. Because of the low damage of the spell, it
takes longer to kill, and you will most probably have to resnare each target
during battle. (I usually do this at 1\2 mana just to be safe) You also have to
factor in resists. If more than 1 target resists a large portion of the damage,
or resists a blast completely, this could lead to problems when going to finish
them off.</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font size="2">* This style of kiting is not very suitable for Tag Team kiting. It's
efficiency is based on keeping the targets together. With someone helping you or
healing you in battle, this may distract one of the targets and end up splitting
them up. Forcing the one assisting you to keep right by your side for the
possibly the rest of the battle. Causing him to get in the way of retargeting
the mobs for you to resnare, etc....</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font size="2">* This spell also has a casting time of 4.5 seconds. So you need plenty of
distance to cast it. I have found that running as soon as the casting meter
disappears, until the spell icon resets for another cast, is enough time to get
the distance you need.</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font size="2">* Because of the time needed to cast the spell, and the distance needed to
cast it safely, it's a good idea to resnare each of the mobs you are kiting once
you get to 1\2 mana during the fight.</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font size="2">The spell line up I primarily use is as follows.</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font size="2">Greater healing Regeneration Shield of brambles Lightning strike Combust (or Firestrike
when you get it) Careless Lightning (keep them handy for finishing off the mobs
if they don't all die at once.) Drones of Doom or Drifting death (if the last
one standing is stunned you can DOT and med while he dies) Snare (gate is also
another one to mem if this method is new or very tricky for you to do.<br>

<p align="justify"><b><font size="2">Initial contact<br>
---------------<br>
Go out and find a mob snare it. Run to another mob that moves at the same speed
(does not have to be same type of mob) and snare it. Do this until you have 4
mobs snared (preferablly in a fairly central location).<br>
<br>
Grouping the mobs together<br>
--------------------------<br>
Now, you have 4 mobs snared. Run away from the mobs and either run in Y pattern
or encircling the mobs until you have them bunched up tight. Then run a safe
distance from them and cast your best area affect spell. But be reminded that
the AoE spells have a very small range , so consider that the mobs need to be
graphically touching.<br>
<br>
The kill<br>
--------<br>
Get the mobs down and continue blasting until you are out of mana or they are
all dead. If you have enough wisdom you can blast them completely, until they
are dead. If you get them to go snare dumb (point they turn and stand still) ,
use your DD spell to finish the job.<br>
<br>
Some points to remember<br>
-----------------------<br>
- They must run at the same speed snared. Multiple speeds = dead druid.<br>
<br>
- Med a little early on in the kite if you think you will need it later on. It
is easier to med a bit with 4 snared mobs than to be running and wishing you had
enough mana to resnare or blast that last mob that resisted your AoE's.<br>
<br>
- Don't worry about your own buffs. I normally only have my highest wolf form
on. Saves down time when the kite is over you don't have to med, buff, med,
kite. You only have to med to full and go get 'em.<br>
<br>
- ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS have gate memed. You sometimes will aggro more than 4
mobs and the way the game engine works you can only damage four at a time. So
know when to get out. Quadding is most efficient if you are not losing exp
because you were to hard headed to gate and tried to root that extra mob. Trust
me I know and have died trying to save a good group of mobs.<br>
<br>
- No Quadding before 34. This is our first AoE spell and you cant do it before.
`nuff said.<br>
<br>
- RAIN SPELLS ARE NOT AoE SPELLS!!! Rain spells do their damage in waves and the
mob MUST be standing in the &quot;rain&quot; to be damaged. Therefore a
snared/MOVING mob will be hard to get in the &quot;rain waves&quot;, much less
getting all 4 mobs into the wave in unison.<br>
<br>
- Your health is not important as long as all mobs are snared. It is as easy to
kite in wolf form with all mobs ensnared with full health as it is half health.
BUT don't be over-confident. If it looks bad and you can't get them off of you
gate. Again , if you lose an hour (s) worth of quadding to death you may has
well have been grouping in a good group and been making steady, safe exp..<br>
<br>
- Be considerate of other people. Yes you can solo. Yes, you are a well oiled
machine. Yes you are an exp machine. BUT do not step on any other people/groups
to quad. I mean, do not go to the snow cougar camp and grab your 4 mobs and run
away if there are 75 other people there camping snow cougars. Most times there
are other places to go, and after all , we are the masters of travel.</font></b></p>
