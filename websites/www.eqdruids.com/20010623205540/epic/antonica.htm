<p align="left">2. Find the <b>Corrupted Aquagoblin Shaman</b> in Lake Rathe.&nbsp; He
is located underwater on top of the deepwater goblin tower.&nbsp; His
placeholders are deepwater goblins and are the outermost spawns on the top of
the tower.&nbsp; Wolf form will prevent agro and allow you to pull singles on
top of the island.&nbsp; Many tainted should spawn
but only a certain one will spawn the corrupted. Best method is to pull them one
at a time on top of the island and kite them so the other goblin shaman below do
not heal the damage you are doing.&nbsp; It is very easy to hide behind trees so
his arrows do not interrupt your casting.&nbsp; Kill him and loot this:</p>
