Track and hunt the Poachers.&nbsp; Collect their heads.</font></p><p class=MsoNormal style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face=Arial>Return to Surefall Glade.&nbsp; If you are KOS be sure to be invisible when wandering otherwise these Rangers can have you dead quickly.&nbsp;</font></p><p class=MsoNormal><font face=Arial>Find Gillarian Naelev,&nbsp; Hand him the Poacher Heads.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p><p class=MsoNormal><font face=Arial>If you are KOS with Gillarian have a friend along that can cast invisibility on you.&nbsp; Now first harmony Gillarian to reduce his agro range, hand him the Poacher heads but don’t hit trade!&nbsp; Have your friend cast invis on you, and then hit trade.&nbsp; Just be prepared to have to re-invis or run after you hit trade if still KOS J&nbsp;</font></p><p class=MsoNormal><font face=Arial>There is another way around the Holly Windstalker faction that might be a way to go if you want to save yourself some time or possibly being killed.&nbsp;</font></p><p class=MsoNormal><font face=Arial>If you have a Ranger friend they can do the quest for you all the way up to spawning the corrupter in East Karana.&nbsp; Kill the corrupter, then YOU loot the corpse.&nbsp; After that you turn in the book and you are off and running!&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p><p class=MsoNormal><font face=Arial><b>Telin Darkforest</b> is the first NPC that you must talk with.&nbsp; If he will not talk to you, you need to do the following:&nbsp;</font></p><p class=MsoNormal><font face=Arial>Go to East Commons.&nbsp; In the 2<sup>nd</sup> group of Inns one of the vendors in the inn sells muffins.&nbsp; Buy as many as you can carry.&nbsp;</font></p><p class=MsoNormal><font face=Arial>Now go to West Freeport.&nbsp; There is a tavern/inn halfway between the West Freeport gates and the East Freeport Zone.&nbsp; Upstairs is a dwarf named Pandros Flintside.&nbsp; You should be able to track him if you are having difficulties finding him.&nbsp;</font></p><p class=MsoNormal><font face=Arial>Go up to him.&nbsp; If you are not KOS with Pandros just keep handing him stacks of muffins.&nbsp; You can hand him 4 in each slot for a total of 16 muffins per turn.&nbsp; You’ll notice your factions improving.&nbsp; It is recommended to go ahead and keep doing this until you are allied with Pandros (solves other problems later if you are).&nbsp;</font></p><p class=MsoNormal><font face=Arial>If you are KOS with Pandros this quest is still doable just going to take a little more work.&nbsp; You will need a friend along that can cast invis/camo on you.&nbsp; This is how you do it.&nbsp; Cast Harmony on Pandros to reduce his agro range.&nbsp; Go up to him, and hand him the muffins but don’t hit trade!&nbsp; Have your friend cast invisibility on you, THEN hit trade.&nbsp; It won’t take too many times of doing this that you will find your faction ok enough to not have to invis.&nbsp;</font></p><p class=MsoNormal><font face=Arial>The next NPC you might have a problem with is <b>Alrik Farsight </b>in Timorous Deep.&nbsp; If he won’t talk to you do the following quest.&nbsp;</font></p><p class=MsoNormal><font face=Arial>Go to East Commons at the Inn that is nearest the West Commons zone.&nbsp; There is a Erudite jewel vendor in one of the side houses near the inn.&nbsp; Purchase as many stacks of batwings as you can.&nbsp;</font></p><p class=MsoNormal><font face=Arial>Now go to the mage guild in South Felwithe.&nbsp; Find Niola Impholder and hand him stacks of 4 batwings per slot (16 total a trade) until your faction is ally.&nbsp; Again if he won’t talk to you, do the same invis trick as the above quest.&nbsp;</font></p><p class=MsoNormal><font face=Arial>Another way to raise this faction is to kill Kizdean Gix in West Commons when he spawns.&nbsp; I would recommend when you are in West Commons and he is up to kill him in preparation for your epic.&nbsp; Just be careful with Kizdean.&nbsp; He is an undercon so don’t attack him at lower levels.</font></p><p class=MsoNormal><font face=Arial><b>Kinlo Strongarm </b>is the<b> </b>next potential problem with faction.&nbsp; If you have killed dwarves before you might have problems with him.&nbsp;</font></p><p class=MsoNormal><font face=Arial>To fix his faction is simple.&nbsp; Go into Crushbone off of Greater Fay and kill Orcs.&nbsp; You should be able to kill them very fast.&nbsp; Save the orc belts and orc legionnaire shoulder pads and turn them into Canloe Nusbeck &nbsp;for faction.&nbsp; You will need 4 belts or 4 shoulder pads at a time to turn in.&nbsp; If your faction isn’t KOS you can buy the belts and legionnaire pads from other players.</font></p><p class=MsoNormal style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face=Arial>That is the major faction hurdles that you might need to fix.&nbsp; If I’ve missed any or someone knows a simpler way to fix faction please let me know and I’ll update this guide!</font></p><p class=MsoNormal style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal style="margin-top: 0;
