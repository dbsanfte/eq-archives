  <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">You say, 'Hail, Examiner 
  Malikin' <br>
  <br>
  Examiner Malikin says 'Good day to you. I hope that you are enjoying the 
  sanctuary that this beautiful city of ours provides. We go through great 
  efforts to keep this city not only clean, but extremely safe as well. Have you 
  ever wondered about the lengths to which we have to work to maintain the 
  safety of a city as fine as this? <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'to what lengths' <br>
  <br>
  Examiner Malikin says 'We have to work with great diligence and determination 
  to maintain the security of this sanctum. There are elements that are set on 
  defiling our work here. These antagonists seem to prefer attempts at 
  corrupting people from within our ranks. Weak minds are inevitable, so 
  corruption is unavoidable. That is why the Eye is necessary. We are not here 
  to pry or spy on anyone. We simply maintain the security of our sanctum and 
  weed out any unsavory elements. If you're interested in learning more about 
  the Eye, I can assign you a simple task or two. <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what is the eye' <br>
  <br>
  Examiner Malikin says 'The Eye keeps us informed of all that goes on beyond 
  the walls. They are responsible for security and purity inside the walls as 
  well. They also monitor the other three Praesertum. <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what simple task' <br>
  <br>
  Examiner Malikin says 'Simple tasks go a great distance to establish trust. I 
  may know of someone who can help you to establish yourself within the ranks of 
  the Eye. If you are interested in performing a task of that nature I can get 
  you started at this time. Would you like to begin? <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'I would like to begin' <br>
  <br>
  Examiner Malikin says 'Very well. Please, take this coin to Questioner Ontu. 
  She will advise you on your next course of action. There is a decided lack of 
  direction in this matter, for a member of the Eye should always be able to 
  find people. This will be good practice for you. Take care. I hope to speak to 
  you again soon. <br>
  <br>
  Questioner Ontu doesn't exist. The name is Percontorius Ontu and is 63+ 
  Location is -132.31, -693.12, 87.13 notice the Z axis <br>
  <br>
  Hand the heavy coin to Percontorius Ontu. <br>
  <br>
  Percontorius Ontu touches the coin to the back of her hand and then looks up 
  with a smile. 'Please take this back to it's source,' she says and nods. You 
  feel the coin return to your hand. Your palm tingles slightly and then the 
  sensation fades.<br>

  <br>
  Hand the heavy coin back to Examiner Malikin <br>
  <br>
  Examiner Malikin says 'Good job! I'm glad that you have returned. I'm also 
  very glad that you were able to see this task as what it was, a purpose to be 
  fulfilled. I'm not sure that you understand, so please allow me to elaborate. 
  The coin that I handed you has great value. That value is obvious in the fact 
  that the coin is made of a precious metal and carries with it more weight than 
  a standard coin. That said, you did not take the coin for your personal gain. 
  You simply carried out your purpose. The fact that you can be trusted has 
  earned you that coin. Do you understand the meaning of the task now? <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'I understand the meaning of the task' <br>
  <br>
  Examiner Malikin says 'Very good, for I have another task to offer you if you 
  would like to continue. This one is a bit more complicated. I'm sure that you 
  can handle it, but I need you to be sure as well. I need this to be a 
  surprise. Do you think that you are prepared to handle an issue that will 
  require both stealth and secrecy? <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'I am prepared' <br>
  <br>
  Examiner Malikin says 'Please take the coin that I have just given you and 
  find my friend, Consis Sinsolus. He can often be found walking in one of the 
  park areas. I'm beginning to believe that he has a mild infatuation with 
  trees. Please take the coin that I have given you and slip it into my friend's 
  left coat pocket. When you do so, please remove the coin that you will find in 
  his pocket and bring it to me. Accomplish this task without error and I may 
  have a special task for you. Take care not to get caught. I would prefer that 
  the swap remain a surprise for him to discover on his own. <br>
  <br>
  Hand the heavy coin to Consis Sinsolus and get back Mark of the Hand I think. 
  I used sneak for this part but not sure it's necessary.<br>
  <br>
  Your Location is 673.96, 774.32, 59.13 <br>
  <br>
  Hand the heavy coin to Consis and receive a Mark of the Hand. <br>
  <br>
  Consis Sinsolus turns to look at you for a moment, but does not appear to 
  notice that you made the swap. <br>
  <br>

  You gain experience!! <br>
  <br>
  Hand the mark/coin of the hand to Examiner malikin. <br>
  <br>
  Examiner Malikin says 'Splendid job! You managed that task quite nicely. 
  Please, keep the coin. The most important part of that task was the fact that 
  you did not stop to question what was being asked of you. That sort of trust 
  is commendable. The Eye is looking for people like you. We need people who 
  display not only integrity, but trust. Trust in our purpose here and you will 
  do well. Our means may seem a bit harsh at times, but we are here to protect 
  our people from an enemy whose methods are without honor. It is one of those 
  very attacks on our people that I will need your help with at this time. <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what can I do to help with the attacks' <br>
  <br>
  Examiner Malikin says 'We have found evidence that there is a traitor within 
  the ranks of one of the other Praesertum. We need you to help us remove this 
  traitor and his contact in Katta Castellum. You will need to take this poison 
  and pour it into our target's ear while he sleeps. <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what is the name of the target' <br>
  <br>
  Examiner Malikin says 'The traitor's name is Ornis Tranum. You should be able 
  to get into his house with little to no resistance. Just be sure to take care 
  when entering and leaving the building. We do not need to bring attention to 
  the Eye in this matter. Once you have poured the poison into Ornis' ear, he 
  will be unable to move. Just place the coin that you took from Consis on Ornis' 
  body and leave. Bring me the empty poison vial, so that I can be sure that no 
  evidence was left behind. Once that is done, we can deal with his contact. <br>
  <br>
  I went invis and entered his house. then handed both the coin and poison to 
  Ornis Tranum, but you can hand them in seperately and it still works. so this 
  can get off if someone does part out of order.<br>
  <br>
  Ornis Tranum gasps suddenly and then falls still. <br>

  <br>
  I didn't get this loc sorry... after you kill him and go back and give the 
  empty vial to Examiner Malikin. <br>
  <br>
  Examiner Malikin says 'Your worth to us is not going unnoticed. There are many 
  people within the Eye that are very pleased with your progress. Finish this 
  next task and we will have something for you. Your willingness to assist us 
  with this most unpleasant task is a great display of allegiance. We are very 
  excited about your future with us, but let's finish with this before we talk 
  further. Take this poison and do with it as you did with Ornis. This time the 
  target is a guard within Katta Castellum. His name is Erallic. Find him when 
  he is asleep after a guard shift and kill him. Be sure to bring me the empty 
  vial and be careful. They will have guards posted. Stealth is key in this 
  matter. Take care. <br>
  <br>
  Sit at location 178.00, -1944.00, 31.13, that's where he will suddenly POP to. 
  I was at his post and he suddenly POPPED to his bed. Hand him the poison.<br>
  <br>
  Legionnaire Erallic gasps silently for air and then falls completely still! No 
  one seems to have heard you. <br>

  <br>
  Examiner Malikin says 'It is good to see you again friend. Your deeds are well 
  known within the ranks of the Eye. You have allowed us to remove several 
  traitors from the walls of this sanctum. We are extremely thankful for your 
  dedication and efforts. Please Take this gift and watch for us to call upon 
  your again in the near future.<br>
