Immediately send your new pet after another creature, like a scythe beetle.</p><p>Let your pet soak up the damage from the beetle, while you do damage from afar, or melee. Sooner or later, your pet will turn, and you can either recharm, or kill the weakened griffawn.</p><p>If all works out best, you’ll end up with a dead beetle, and a pet that is already weakened and much easier to slay. This will take time and practice. For the first few tries, while you get familiar with the strategy, make sure you have a zone handy!</p><p>In addition to the charm line of spells, druids also get two pet buffs, <b>Feral Spirit</b> (14) and <b>Savage Spirit</b> (44), which makes your pet more effective in battle. While it makes your pet a killing machine, especially with a thorn shield, it will turn on you eventually so be ready!</font></p><p><font face=Arial size=2>Many players who have mastered the Charming technique say it gives better experience than normal kiting.</p><p><a href=#Contents><font face Arial size=2>Back To Top</font></a></p></TD></TR><TR><TD><hr></TD></TR><TR><TD><p><a name="Basic Pet Commands"><font face=Arial size=5 color=008000><b>Basic Pet Commands:</b></font></a></p><p><font size=2>There is a very good list of all the in-game pet commands at the Mage's Compendium.

It's important to note that charming stronger creatures seems to affect the charm time, thus (at lower levels) charming a white creature will not last near as long as charming a blue creature. At higher levels (44+), much of what you would be able to charm will con green to you.</p><p>Here are the tactics I've used to go from 14th to 17th in relatively short time:</p><center><table border=0 width=90%><tr><td><font size=2><p>I charm a blue creature and then I immediately command it to attack another blue creature. I would then use a DoT, direct damage, and some melee to assist the pet and keep my pet from taking too much damage.</p><p>After this kill, immediately target another blue creature, command your pet to attack it, then DoT it.&nbsp; Come in for a little bit of melee, but mainly use direct damage to help finish it off.&nbsp; It is important to make sure that your pet (and you) survives, but takes the majority of the damage.&nbsp; It is also important to reserve enough mana for a couple more damage-dealing spells.</p><p>After this battle (perhaps before its even through) your charm will wear off, and your pet should be ready to turn on you. You should have saved enough mana in anticipation of this. Immediately begin attacking the former pet and you should be able to take it easily (its low on hitpoints from fighting). If it's hitpoints are low enough, it will begin to run and you can simply melee it. If the charm wore off prior to the end of the second encounter, don't bother re-charming your former pet. Simply concentrate on finishing off both mobs.</p></td></tr></table></center><p>Using these tactics you can take down at least two to three blue creatures within a few minutes. Depending on your level, this can yield more exp than one yellow and gives as much as some red creatures.&nbsp; Compared to normal kiting, you will get almost as much exp without spending nearly as much time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, your exp gain over time will be much greater.</p><p>Unfortunately, these tactics don't always work well.&nbsp; You'll sometimes have your initial charm resisted (I usually try at least twice before giving up and blasting the creature). You can also have your pet turn on you too early in the second fight, and find yourself having to take on two relatively healthy blues (it's normally best to zone in this case).&nbsp; Luckily, you will always have SoW up, and you should not have much of a problem getting to a zone.</p><p>It's important to make the decision to Fight or Flee immediately and stick with it -- If you aren't going to win the fight, don't waste the mana and hitpoints seeing if you can kill one of the creatures before fleeing. Its much better to just zone, have a quick rest break, and get back to it.</p><p><a href=#Contents><font face Arial size=2>Back To Top</font></a></p></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></td></tr></table></center><p align=justify><a href=../index.html>Return to Main</a></p></div></td></tr></table><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td><p align=center style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size=1>All information contained on this website copyright Thistlethorne Enterprises 2001-2002.&nbsp; Everquest copyright Sony Inc.</font></p></td></tr></table><!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table><!--msnavigation--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td><p align=center style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size=1>All information contained on this website copyright Thistlethorne Enterprises 2001-2002.&nbsp; Everquest copyright Sony Inc.</font></p></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table></body></html>
