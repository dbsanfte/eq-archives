                        <P>With the recent change in the hotkey system, druids
                        now have another option for spell book organization.
                        Using the <B>"/book #"</B> command we can create a bank
                        of hotkeys that corresponds to certain sections of our
                        spell books.</P>
                        <P align=justify>For example, if we need to travel to
                        Rivervale and do some banking after camping the generous
                        Ice Giants in Everfrost Peaks, we simply click the
                        hotkey labeled <B>"Rings"</B>. Whamo! We automatically
                        sit with the spell book opened to the appropriate page
                        to memorize the spell.</P>
                        <P align=justify>Personally I have 19 hotkeys with
                        Abbreviated titles that correspond to the following
                        sections of my spell book:</P>

                              because you don't have enough spell slots.
                              <P>The reason I made this hotkey is for when I
                              delve deep into the pages of my incantations for a
                              spell that I may be using in a limited way for
                              next few hours or days. After I have "right
                              clicked" the spell icon deep within the book I hit
                              this "NORM" hotkey followed by another "right
                              click" on a blank spot to finish the process of
                              swapping the spell's previous location to my
                              frequently used section. This saves time because
                              you do not have to flip back 20 pages to move the
                              spell and is easier than typing the "/book #"
                              command. You might want to reserve the first two
                              pages for this "Normal" section so as to have a
                              blank spot or two just incase the situations of
                              the adventure change. My hotkey is labeled "NORM"
                              and the command in the first line of the hotkey
                              popup menu is "/book 1".</P></FONT></TD></TR>

                        <P>I put my spell section hotkeys on Hotkey Banks #'s
                        8-10. I arranged them in reverse order though. The
                        hotkeys for sections 1-6 of my spell book are placed in
                        Hotkey bank #10, sections 7-12 are placed in Hotkey bank
                        #9 etc. This way when I sit with the book open I can
                        minimize the time it takes to click the arrows above the
                        hotkey bank. I click the left button from hotkey bank #1
                        and go to hotkey bank #10 which contains the buttons for
                        sections 1-6 of my spell book (the most important
                        sections for me). I do this in reverse order because I
                        have hotkey banks 1-4 already set up for special gaming
                        situations such as for the days I solo, when I am on a

                        repeated in the first four Hotkey banks...but I digress.
                        I only have 6 sections per hotkey bank because when you
                        sit to med the default view is the "framed" window which
                        limits the visible hotkeys per bank to 6. I put my
                        section hotkeys in the top 6 slots of the hotkey banks.
                        Additionally, you may decide to include the "NORM"
                        button or another spell section hotkey in the 6 buttons
                        for every hotkey bank. This will increase the total
                        number of hotkey banks used in this system but it may
                        reduce the time involved in arranging your spells. You
                        use what suits you best.</P>
                        <P>Also, a little planning needs to go into this. Some
                        sections of your spell book take only one page while
                        others will take two or more. For example, I divided my
                        teleport spells into three sections. I have more group
                        teleport spells than can fit on two pages. So I made a
                        special section just for Scars and Kunark teleport
                        spells. The reasoning behind this is because you can
                        only look at two pages at a time. If you divide a
                        section in such a way as to require a page turn to see
                        the entire section you may have to make 2 hotkey buttons
                        for the same section. To avoid this I made sure that no
                        section was more than 2 pages and that both pages were
                        displayed at the same time. When planning your hotkeys
                        (making the "/book #" commands) you also should consider
                        the fact that the page numbers are odd on the left and
                        even on the right.</P><BR>
                        <P>After you have decided on how to divide your spell
                        book into these "sections", you make your hotkeys. To
                        make a hotkey you click the "Socials" Button (use
                        <B>ALT+M</B> if you are in full screen mode). You will
                        then see many buttons with little names and two arrow
                        keys above. Click one of these arrows until you see many
                        "Blank" buttons. Right click on a blank button to see
                        the hotkey pop up widow. You left click in the little
                        title box at the top to name the new button you are
                        creating. You can change the color of the text by left
                        clicking the little box just to the right of the title
                        box. Next, left click on one of the lines below the
                        title. Type "/book #". Make a space between "/book" and
                        the actual number that you put here. This number is the
                        page of your spell book that you want this hotkey to
                        turn to. Click the "done" button next. You will see your
                        newly created button in the socials menu now. To move
                        the new button to your hotkey bank on the left you left
                        click and hold. Pull it over to the hotkey bank and
                        release. Sometimes the new button does not go into the
                        little box. Just try it again. Later with a little
                        experience you can also have a little fun by adding some
                        emotes or spoken phrases to the section hotkey. For
                        instance when you hit the hotkey to open the spell book
                        to the teleport spells you can include a phrase like
                        "MMMM where are those teleport spells" "oh here they are
                        under the letter "E" for EXPENSIVE!"</P>
