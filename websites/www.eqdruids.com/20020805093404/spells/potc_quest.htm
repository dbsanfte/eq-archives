If you'll excuse me, I'm a bit busy copying this new [scroll]. I'll be with you in a moment to chat, or to trade if you've come about the [earring].&quot;<br> <br> You say, 'What scroll?'<br> <br> Rebecca Cabbageleaf looks up again with a quiet smile, &quot;I'm making a copy of a new Protection spell, it's very exciting! The druids of Norrath have just completed an important ritual, and the gods have blessed us with this new spell! I'd be happy to scribe you a copy, if you were to fetch me the [ingredients].&quot;<br> <br> You say, 'What ingredients?'<br> <br> Rebecca Cabbageleaf says, &quot;Oh, let me see... I'll need a sheet of fancy Blessed parchment, a small flask of Dark Root ink, and of course a large quill. I think a Stormraven's quill would be best, certainly better than this one I've been using so far. Bring those items to me and I'll be happy to make you a copy for yourself. I'm not sure where you'll find all of those, I seem to have bought up the last of the stock in several places. Someone's bound to have them for sale, good luck with it!&quot;<br> <br> Rebecca Cabbageleaf smiles warmly, &quot;Brilliant, you've brought me some more supplies! Here, please take this last copy I've made. I'd planned to use it for myself, but I'll let you use it so you don't have to wait for me to make a new one. I do hope you enjoy it!&quot;<br> <br> You gain experience!</p><hr><p>Blessed Parchment is purchased in Rivervale. The merchant's name is Byl Babbinsbort at loc -140, -120.<br> <br> Dark Root Ink is purchased in Greater Faydark at Kelethin. Near the druid guild is a store called Bilrib's Smithy. Instead of going through the door, edge around the right side of the building where you'll find Bilrio Surecut at loc 645, 385.<br> <br> Stormraven Quill is purchased in Surefall Glade in the druid guild. The building has a sign which reads Jaggedpine Treefolk. At the back counter is a merchant named Sequea Erthinon who sells the quill.<br> <br> I paid roughly 284pp for the parchment, 252pp for the ink, and 261pp for the quill. This was with 100+ charisma and with apprehensive, ally, and amiable faction respectively. (I'm a Wood Elf so naturally the Kelethin folks will like me more). <img alt=:) src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif width=15 height=15> <br> <br> Your price may vary depending on charisma or faction, but expect to pay between 750-800pp for this spell.<br> <br> The reward is a spell scroll:<br> <br> Protection of the Cabbage (NO DROP)<br> Level 59, 500 mana<br> Single-target version of Protection of the Glades<br> <b><br> </b><a href=level_59_spells.htm>Back</a><br> &nbsp;</p></td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr></table><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td><p align=center style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size=1>All information contained on this website copyright Thistlethorne Enterprises 2001-2002.&nbsp; Everquest copyright Sony Inc.</font></p></td></tr></table><!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table><!--msnavigation--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td><p align=center style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size=1>All information contained on this website copyright Thistlethorne Enterprises 2001-2002.&nbsp; Everquest copyright Sony Inc.</font></p></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table></body></html>
