As &quot;Tech Live&quot; reports tonight, the hugely popular multiplayer fantasy game is heading to a city near you.<p>In June, Sony Online Entertainment kicked off a nationwide tour promoting four expansions of its game.</p><p>&quot;Everquest is the No. 1 online 3D game in the world. See for yourself why,&quot; barked Sony's community relations consultant, Brian DeMarco, as a handful of curious passers-by stopped at the elaborately decorated Everquest tour van in downtown San Francisco July 3.</p><p>The 
      <a href=http://eqlive.station.sony.com/eqinvasion/>EQ Invasion Tour 2002</a> kicked off in San Diego in June. The multicity cross-country trip will end in Massachusetts in September.</p><p><b>Expanding the EQ experience</b></p><p>At the San Francisco stop, PCs were hooked up with the latest Everquest expansion series, &quot;The Planes of Power,&quot; and interested onlookers were encouraged to test their gaming abilities.</p><p>&quot;With this expansion, we're focusing on the idea of giving them that arching story more than we have in the past,&quot; said Shawn Lord, assistant designer of the expansion series. &quot;We want them to feel like -- from the minute they come in and start playing in this expansion -- they are part of one big quest.&quot;</p><p>It's a journey developers at Sony say they believe is richer than ever.</p><p>&quot;We want to take this expansion and give them not only a nice solid story line to follow, but [also] the ability to expand their character,&quot; Lord said.</p><p>Tour promoters aim to keep players in the &quot;EQ zone&quot; with EverQuest giveaways that include washable tattoos and comic books.</p><p><b>Getting them hooked</b></p><p>When asked what lures the EverQuest newbie, DeMarco says it's a combination of intrigue and challenge.</p><p>&quot;Then the curiosity gets them. And then when they come up to a computer and actually start playing the game. They pretty much get pulled into the EverQuest world,&quot; DeMarco said. &quot;It's like being a member of a large orchestra when you are a part of a guild raid or a situation where you need the cooperation of may people in order to slay a dragon or do something in common.&quot;</p><p>In San Francisco, gamers who tried the expansion say they are drawn to the game's sense of community and the friendship it fosters.</p><p>&quot;I have lots of friends online,&quot; one fan said. &quot;I play with people in Canada, I play with people on the East Coast, I've played with people in Japan. It's really fun to be able to make contact with people who you'll never really see.&quot;</p><p>Lord says the increased number of animation tools lets players embellish their character and, subsequently, the experience. The more tools available to the player, the more elaborate the characters become. That increases replay value, he adds.</p><p>&quot;We're hoping to make it so they're more permanent, positive changes in the [EverQuest] world you're playing in based on the actions you perform,&quot; Lord said.</p><p>For the gamers who just can't get enough of EverQuest, every expansion equals a positive move for Sony.</p><p>Here are the next stops for the tour:</p><ul><li>Hood River, Oregon, July 17-18 </li><li>Portland, Oregon, July 19 </li><li>Chicago, July 24-28 </li><li>Cleveland, July 31 and August 1-4 </li><li>Minneapolis, August 7-8 </li><li>Eden Prairie, Minnesota, August 9 </li><li>Philadelphia, August 14-19 </li><li>Baltimore, August 22-25 </li><li>New York, August 28-31 and September 1 </li><li>New Haven, Connecticut, September 2 </li><li>Boston, September 5-7, 10, and 13 </li><li>Cambridge, Massachusetts, September 8-9, 12, and 14</li></ul></font></td></tr></table></td>

    <td height=18><font face=Arial size=2>From the developers corner:<p>First, let me qualify this by saying I don't have a character on test server so I am sending this in hopes you can pass it on to the dev team.&nbsp; Two issues come to mind that you might want to look into.</p><p>First, the traders satchels weigh 25 stone empty, that is 200 stone in weight before anyone even puts objects into them....How will characters be able to move with full packs?</p><p>Second...what if I want to sell 10 slot tailor made backpacks, or smithed tool kits, or any other containers? Can containers be placed in containers in /trader mode?</p><p><b>Weight isn’t an issue in the Bazaar. When people carrying too much weight started to die going down a step, we took out a lot of the restrictions for weight in that zone.</b></p><p><b>Bags can’t go into bags. There are two reasons for this. One is that it would lead to infinite storage capacity. Just as importantly, putting containers inside containers was known to cause the world to collapse back when it was possible (all sorts of ‘bad things’ would happen to characters and their stuff). And, well, nobody really wants that.</b></p><p>For the Protection of the Cabbage quest there is a great demand for foraged items so my first thought was to try and sell these.&nbsp; If I set my character to sell food will the character starve or eat his/her profits away?</p><p>Does the old rule of the food in the first inventory slot being eaten first still apply ?</p><p><b>As far as I know, your character will continue to eat in the normal fashion. So you might have to worry about eating yourself out of business. At least folks selling baked goods will be eating well while they work.</b></p><p>Are items only in the trade satchels available for people to buy?&nbsp;&nbsp; What if you have something in the bag that you forgot to price, will that be sellable for some default price? Do the bags have to be in your inventory or can they be in the bank?</p><p><b>Only items in trade satchels can be sold, and those satchels must be on a character that is standing in a stall. So, no, you can’t sell things that are in the bank, and you’ll have to remember to get the items you want to sell into a satchel and priced.</b></p><p><b>- Alan</b></font></td>
