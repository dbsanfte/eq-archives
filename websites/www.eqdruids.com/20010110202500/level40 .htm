<font SIZE="2"><p>First of all, this guide is aimed towards druid players levels 40-50, so if you are any lower, you might not be able to relate to some of the things I am saying. With that out of the way, let me get to the grouping guide.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Druid spells cover a little bit of everything, duh. If you&#146;ve made it this far and don&#146;t know that, hit your back button. Since our spells are so versatile, we need to change our spells depending on the dungeon we are grouping in. I&#146;m going to go through every dungeon I&#146;ve hunted in, (which I think is them all) to give you specific scenarios that have happened to me and could happen to you. </p>

<p>Lower Guk</p>

<p>In this dungeon, a runner means sure death. Snare is the first spell you cast in here. Lets say your party is built up of a level 40 druid, cleric, warrior, necromancer, monk, and wizard. Lets say you want to camp the executioner. The spells you should have memorized are greater heal, succor ro, skin like diamond, snare, drones of doom, shield of spikes, pack regeneration, and combust. Let me first go over the use for each of these.</p>

<p>-Greater heal- gives you some support healing power to help the cleric out. If the cleric is busy healing your tanks, and your wizard is getting hit, the cleric cannot be in every place at once so its your job to keep him or her alive till the tanks pull the mob off of him.</p>

<p>-Succor Ro- You want to succor to sro first of all because its closest to guk. Also in the chance that you were sloppy and didn&#146;t snare the mobs you were fighting and it gets away, have your finger poised to hit this button because chances are he is going to bring back his buddies to own your group. Sometimes people are stubborn and think your group of 6 can handle 7 or 8 froglok ghoul zol knights. Well, chances are you can&#146;t so you should probably evac before you have to do messy corpse retrievals. If the situation is iffy, use your mana only for healing and snaring, and if it comes down to healing or evacing, evac. No brainer, don&#146;t even think about it.</p>

<p>Skin like Diamond/ - give this to everyone in your group, because everyone needs all the ac/hps they can get when fighting mobs of this caliber.</p>

<p>Snare- invaluable for any dungeon. This should be the first thing you cast so that runners do not pull a horde of nasties onto your group.</p>

<p>Shield of  Spikes/ -This does 16 damage I believe, if your tank is hit 20 times in 30 seconds (and that is on the low side), for a little over 100 mana you have done 320 damage. It builds up really fast and can save everyone a lot of mana.</p>

<p>Drones of Doom/- Unless you are fighting a caster mob you just want to  DOT the monster, AFTER you&#146;ve snared the monster, then sit down to regain mana. (Note: you always /assist &lt;tankname&gt; so you don&#146;t accidentally pull a mob onto yourself)</p>

<p>Pack Regeneration- Hands down, most efficient way to heal your group. You regain 7 or 8 health every 3 seconds, for 15 minutes for 200 mana. You do the math.</p>

<p>Firestrike- We don&#146;t do all the nuking but sometimes we do some, so it is a must to have this memmed.</p>

<p>Ok so now you are ready to take the executioner. First you have your tank target the executioner, if he is not spawned target the hardest mob in the room. Put damage shields on your monk and warrior before the fight so mobs won&#146;t get mad when you do it in battle. Have your warrior run in first to pull all of the mobs onto them. Then, send in your monk. (Note: Monks are a support melee class, they cannot take hits for crap, but deal better melee damage than a warrior in some cases) Now /assist &lt;tankname&gt;, snare, dot, sit down to regain mana. When the mob he is killing falls, get up, /assist &lt;tankname&gt;, snare, dot, sit down again. Only nuke if there is a caster mob among them. Necromancers and the wizard have all their mana to use on nuking since they aren&#146;t good for anything else, so let them do their job. When the fight is over, pack regen your group. Executioner camp owned. (Note: Notice I said necromancer and wizard nuking. If your cleric is nuking during the battle instead of healing, toss that cleric. It is understandable when the tank is at 4 and a half bubbles and there is one mob left, but if you&#146;re just starting the fight and they are nuking, they are morons.)</p>

<p>Solusek Dungeon B</p>

<p>You want to have the same spells memorized here if you are fighting kobolds, because your fire spells still do work. Let us say that you want to camp the king/priest spawn for some
Runed Mithril bracers; here is what you do. Assuming you have the same group, you again damage shield and send your tank in to the room first, 4 kobolds come I believe. The king hits for 105s or so, so you need to pay close attention to the casters hp&#146;s when they start nuking him because he will stick on them, and can drop them quickly. Also sometimes his kobold subjects can see him getting mad, and will join him. So you again /assist &lt;tankname&gt;, snare, dot, sit down. If you use the same strategy you used in lower guk on the executioner, you will find that you can now take THE best exp/item hunting spot that will last you until level 50. The
Runed Mithril bracers are also +5 wis +3 str, and 4(?) ac. They look like lavender platemail, a very nice catch for you and the cleric. Lets say that something goes wrong, because things do happen. Your wizard dies during the fight from a sudden agro frenzy from the king and some of the kobolds, they then turn on the tank, and when the cleric starts using his big heals they all agro him, the warrior and monk try to pull them off but in vain. Then the necromancer tries nuking one of them, and gets himself agroed. What do you do? Heal the cleric first, the necromancer has 250-350 dmg life drains he can use. Only heal him if he gets critically low. Once the cleric is in safe health range, and things are still not letting up on him, evac. There is no way you can heal 3 different people at once. If the mob has agroed you, enough should be off of the cleric to let him heal people, and you should make it through the fight OK.</p>

<p>Kedge Keep</p>

<p>In here, replace combust with Invigor, and enduring breath where snare goes, since no mobs attempt to run in this dungeon. Again basically same principle as used in solb and guk, damage shield your tank, dot, and sit down unless the mob is a caster. Usually in here there will be a second group with you since most spawns are too hard for 1 group. If this is the case, unless the mob is named, don&#146;t bother doting. The combined nuke power of two groups eats up anything in a matter of seconds, instead, nuke once or twice, not to exhaustion, and sit down. Keep your melee fighter&#146;s invigored for stamina so that they don&#146;t lose stats, and their attack speed stays up.</p>
