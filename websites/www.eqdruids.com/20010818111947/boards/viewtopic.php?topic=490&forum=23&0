<FONT COLOR="#333399" face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">This was done late, in one draft. Please forgive errors...I may be revising this and adding to it later. <BR>------------------------------------------ <BR><BR>There are quite a few opinions concerning the effectiveness of druids in groups after reaching level 50. Some of these are completely valid and some aren't, but the fact remains that as time goes by, many druids are finding it harder and harder to get groups. <BR><BR>On a large organized raid, almost every class can be useful. The druid's ability to quickly transport people around is often critical to arranging raids and gathering hunting parties. But once the raid starts you're quickly placed in a supporting role that won't garner you much attention. <BR><BR>This is one area that strongly promotes the misperception that druids aren't very important. After all, when the fight is over and that uber-mob lies dead on the floor, it was the monks who tag-pulled single mobs, the warriors who dispatched them, the enchanter who mez'd the stragglers and kept the mana flowing for the clerics who healed and ressurected people. The druids just got them to the fight and offered up some "crap" buffs so that the good buffs wouldn't be wiped out in the first few seconds of the fight. <BR><BR>Most people will recognize, on some level, that the druids were fairly critical in the setup of a large raid. Oddly enough it's these same people who are quick to ask you to teleport their whole group from point A to point B while declining to include you in the hunting that follows. Your supporting role on the large raid was recognized for what it was: a supporting role only. <BR><BR>If you're putting together a single group to hunt in one of the hi-level zones, you have no reason to want a druid in your group. We don't heal as good as a cleric, we can't fight to save our lives, we can't provide you any noticable mana improvements and if you're fighting indoors we just become even less effective. <BR><BR>While there are a lot of changes Verant could make that will make Druids much more effective and desirable at higher levels (and I hope they do), there are plenty of things that druids can do to make other players realize how effective a druid can be. <BR><BR>One of the biggest problems facing druids is other druids. There are too many druids and so few GOOD druids. If you want to get in groups past level 50 you have to be a VERY GOOD druid. You have to overcome the bad reputation that your misguided brethren have built for you. Here are the keys to helping repair our reputation so that all of us can benefit: <BR><BR>-Stop complaining. <BR>Few players are going to have any sympathy for you. After all you had it easy, you can quad-kite for xp and loot. The fact is, you chose to play a druid. Whether you knew what you were in for or not is irrelevant. Follow the rest of these tips and you'll have much less to complain about. (Trust me, I KNOW where you're coming from, I'm a frustrated druid too) <BR><BR>-Get your skills up. <BR>If you're in your 50s, and so is your divination skill, you're beyond pathetic. There's no reason you shouldn't have most, if not ALL of your casting skills maxed or nearly maxed. If they're not and you're prone to fizzling, you need to fix it. Load up those cheap low-level spells and cast until you just can't stand it (You've got plenty of time, you're not getting a group until your skills improve). You can make this even MORE productive by working on trade skills while meding. <BR><BR>If you're REALLY sharp, you can do this 'caster' training in Everfrost, Misty Thicket, Innothule Swamp, Firiona Vie and Greater Faydark where you can FORAGE items you'll need for your epic. (But if you were THAT smooth, you've already got those items and your casting skills are tip-top)  <BR><BR>-Learn your spells. <BR>I met a level 52 druid today who didn't know what 'Egress' was, or even that he should have it. Granted, in a roleplaying sense, it's a dropped spell and a true roleplayer wouldn't know it existed until someone told him about it or until it fell in his lap. I'm sorry to say it, but if you want to be a GOOD druid, forget about the 'ignorance is bliss'-world of roleplaying: you've got to get online and READ. (Since you're reading this, I'll assume you at least know how to find sites with druid information). <BR><BR>When I say 'Learn your spells', I'm not just talking about knowing what spells you get at the next level. Anyone can (and should) know that much. I mean dig DEEP into those spells to find out how they really work and what the really do. <BR><BR>Would you like to know exactly what Ro's Fiery Sundering does? Write down all your stats and then cast it on yourself. Get a friend to duel you so you can cast it on them to double check it for consistancy. Get used to the time it takes to cast the spell, recover from the spell and recast the spell. Learn how long the effects last. <BR><BR>Want to know what DoT's stack? Load them all up, root a healthy mob and cast them all. <BR><BR>Want to know where egress/succor drops you? Bind in a safe spot, load up egress and gate and run from zone to zone trying it out. (You've got plenty of time, you're not getting a group until you learn this stuff) <BR><BR>-Organize those spells. <BR>My spell book is nicely arranged by category with hotkeys assigned to the appropriate pages (using the /book ## command). Organize them in whatever system works best for you, there are as many methods as there are players. However, make SOME attempt. Mine are sorted as buffs, group buffs, self buffs, self gates, group gates, kunark/velious gates, evacs, healing, utility, DoT/AoE, Snare/Dispell/Debuff, DD..and so on. All of the junk spells are in the back of the book, a constant blank page is designated for scribing new spells and a separate page is devoted to those spells that are perfect for cheaply practing and increasing casting skills. <BR><BR>Those of you who read all that and are thinking, "That's too much work" "That's silly" Stop reading now and go start a warrior, you're not willing to put in the effort and you're not going to improve enough to be anything more than a casual player who can't find a group. <BR><BR>Organizing your spells gives you ANOTHER way to learn more about them and makes it much simpler and quicker to memorize a needed spell quickly at a crucial moment. Fighting a new mob and realized that your tanks are getting slammed by a damage shield on every hit? Hmmm, what page is that dispell on? What was it called again? Oh..they're dead...nevermind. <BR><BR>Long fight? Now where did I put 'Envigor'? (Those of you who even know you have the spell or what it does seem to be in the minority.) <BR><BR>-Pay attention. <BR>You've been told so often that you're a second-class citizen that you've started to play like one. You're so convinced that you're not essential to the group that you get LAZY. When you wait a little too long to heal or evac or you're too busy chatting with a friend when that bad pull shows up, you're done. All because you didn't think you were very important and didn't need to pay attention. <BR><BR>If your group thinks you're there JUST to evac, and you manage to screw up that one task...how many groups are going to want you? (Side note: If your group thinks you're just there to evac, find another group) <BR><BR>If you're not the primary healer (and you probably aren't), keep an eye on that person. Watch how often they're casting and be ready to take over heals as needed...and be ready to heal THEM when they draw too much agro from heals. <BR><BR>-Group Well. <BR>Found out who's in charge of the group, what your role is, who's doing the pulling and who your assist should be set to. If there's another druid in the group coordinate with them so that mana isn't wasted casting and recasting the same spells. <BR><BR>If you can't get answers or no one wants to take charge, it's time for YOU to take charge or find yourself another group. <BR><BR>-Buff yourself <BR>Buff yourself first, when possible. If you're giving the primary attackers a strength buff, cast it on yourself first. When yours starts flashing you'll know they're all about to wear off and can re-memorize (if needed) and re-cast before any of them have a chance to start asking for it. <BR><BR>-Buff the casters <BR>"Only give HP/AC buffs to the tanks" Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Sure, it's mana efficient and smart, and in the heat of battle you should only be REFRESHING that buff on the tanks. But during the staging sequences and whenever you've got good down time with full mana; give those casters some hit points. When they accidently draw agro, the extra hitpoints and armor class you can give them MIGHT be the difference between life and death....for the whole group. <BR><BR>-'Pimp' yourself wisely <BR>If you're constantly able to refresh those buffs and keep people alive without being noticed (by using the previous nifty tips), many players aren't going to notice you. So how do you get around that? Easy. Make GOOD hot keys. Getting ready to refresh those strength buffs for the third time? A quick click on a hotkey will let them know. "/g CASTING (spell type) on %T" is good enough, but spicing them up can lighten the mood and still serve to show your usefulness. "/g DOG-PILE on the Druid!! - Group Chloro incoming!" (which will also keep that curious monk from running out of range of the spell) <BR><BR>-Learn some new skills <BR>No, I'm not talking about trade skills. Druids are fairly unique in their ability to emulate the abilities of many other classes in the game. The old line about being "jack of all trades, master of none" suits us well. <BR><BR>Crowd control isn't just the realm of enchanters and bards. If you're group is fighting a mob and another one jumps into the fight, snare that puppy, smack him if you have to and kite him a little out of range. When you get him far enough away, root him and get back to business. Spice it up with a hotkey that says "GHETTO-MEZZED -- %T" and you've just proven to the group that they don't ALWAYS need a chanter for crowd control. <BR><BR>-Communicate well. <BR>Don't just use those hotkeys for shameless self-promotion and humor, organize a GOOD set of communcation hotkeys. Communicating effectively is essential. Let them know when you've snared, rooted or dot'd something. Let them know when you've got the agro and are kiting it for them to beat on. Let them know when you're low on mana or out of mana. <BR>Keep the messages short, recognizable and to the point. <BR><BR>-Be a knowledge sponge. <BR>It's not necessary to know every spell for every class or to know every item, mob, zone or quest...but it helps. Learn as much as you can about the dynamics of the game. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the other classes you're going to be grouping with can make every battle smoother, safer and much more fun. <BR>Try to pick up as many tips and tricks as you can. If your puller just feigned death, you can INSTANTLY tell whether or not he succeeded by the message that pops up and/or the way the mobs react...KNOW what to do when that happens. <BR><BR>-Know the game mechanics <BR>Besides the actual nuances of the various classes and in-game items and creatures, get to know the EQ interface. Learn those keyboard shortcuts for sitting/standing, cycling through hot key pages, casting spells. Learn the interface commands that allow you to make useful hotkeys. Learn the commands you need to execute to reduce your lag during a raid (and make a set of hotkeys to shift from one mode to the other). Understand the affects of lag. Understand how long it takes for you to receive health updates on players and creatures in different situations and at different ranges. <BR>Know it ALL (or as much as you realistically can)...because then you can teach it to others and we'll all have a better game. <BR><BR>There's more...much, much more. Unfortunately, I fear that those who would benefit most are the ones least likely to read it. If you've made it this far, there's a good chance that I didn't provide much (if any) new information. Congratulations and thank you, sincerely...odds are good that you're not part of the problem. I encourage ALL of you to share useful tips and information, knowledge is key. Help out the new players when you can, just don't spoon feed them or they'll never learn anything. <BR><BR>The best advice you can give a new player is this: <BR>Create a character, play it to level 5 and start a new one. Once you've done this for several classes, STOP playing, jump on the web and hit one of the major EQ sites and read until you're sure that you understand the game enough to enjoy it and play it well. Then read a little more.  <BR><BR>There are changes that Verant can make to help us out, but until then, we need to work to help ourselves. <BR><BR>-Aerohn Mistweaver <BR>Honored Circle (Xev) <BR> <BR></FONT><BR></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR="#f7f5e6"><TD nowrap align="left">&nbsp;</TD><TD><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp<a href="/boards/bb_profile.php?mode=view&user=221"><img src="/boards/images/profile.gif" border=0 alt="View Profile of Flaim"></a>
