<p align="justify"><b><font color="#CC9900" size="2">Thanks.&nbsp; That word doesn't begin to cover what I feel.&nbsp; When I took 
over this website I knew I was going to be in for a challenge.&nbsp; I took a 
look at the structure of the website, and thought &quot;well, here we go, time to 
start the job!&quot;.&nbsp; </font> </b> </p>
<p align="justify"><b><font color="#CC9900" size="2">I put in I think five straight nights of about seven hour days each, changing 
things around, adding content, and making updates.&nbsp; Afterwards, I told my 
wife &quot;after all this work, you know if they don't like it, I might just have to 
scream a little!&quot;&nbsp; Luckily my wife is a very understanding woman, and 
looked at me and said &quot;I know honey&quot;.</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font color="#CC9900" size="2">So when I put up the first update, I was really nervous.&nbsp; I was afraid 
you guys wouldn't like what was being done.&nbsp; Then the first e-mails started 
coming in.&nbsp; Some had issues they wanted to discuss, but most were very nice 
e-mails.&nbsp; No one wrote anything that I felt was anything but helpful.</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font color="#CC9900" size="2">This encouraged me.&nbsp; Maybe I'd be ok with all this!&nbsp; Then as time 
continued, more people wrote.&nbsp; And I have to tell you, some of the e-mails 
I have received, have been some of the nicest things you could ever want to 
hear.&nbsp; I've saved them all, so if I ever do start to get discouraged, all I 
have to do is reread those letters!</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font color="#CC9900" size="2">You all have not only continued to encourage me, help me, show me my errors 
(which I also do appreciate!), you made me realize that this group of people is 
one of the greatest groups of people you could ever want to be around.</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font color="#CC9900" size="2">So all I can say is, Thanks!</font></b></p>
