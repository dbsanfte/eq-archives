Created at the whim of the demi-goddess Druzzil Ro for the 
purpose of creating music to soothe the soul, Ayonae Ro grew to develop powers 
and a distinct personality of her own. Druzzil sacrificed a small portion of her 
own place to create a new realm to be dominated by Ayonae Ro, the Demi-Plane of 
Music. Ayonae can not only cause others to become caught up in her music to the 
point of feeling the emotions therein, she is able to mold and shape the very 
realm in which she lives, much as her mother does with her own magical skills.

Druzzil has white hair which is held back from her face by a massive platinum 
crown with a single white gem that blazes like a brilliant white star upon her 
brow. She is tall, youthful in appearance, with a resemblance to Erudite in skin 
and body structure. The Demi-Plane of Magic became the home of the goddess of 
magic. In its natural state, it is an infinitely expansive plane of perfect 
white and unblemished marble under a gray and featureless sky, though one would 
likely never glimpse her plane in such a state. Through the will of Druzzil Ro, 
her home takes the shape, form and features that reflect her current mood. Her 
plane is simply a canvas for her art.</font></p>

Luclin, the Maiden of Shadows rules the Plane of Shadow, She is short of 
stature, about 4'9&quot; tall; sleek and thin, with an elfin body structure. Her 
short hair is deep gray with long side locks down to her stomach. Her silver 
eyes have no pupils and her skin is solid black. She wears black and gray robes 
and a shadowy mist perpetually swirls around her feet. In one hand she bears a 
massive silver and platinum staff carved in the shape of two tendrils wrapping 
around one another to form two humanoid hands at the top. Floating just above 
the cupped palms of the hands is a small black orb whose surface has an 
iridescent sheen similar to that of oil.</font></p>

</b>Morell-Thule, the Lord of Dreams rules the Demi-Plane 
of Dreams where he is responsible for the rich texture of sleep visions. He 
creates, animates and thoroughly enjoys the creatures who romp in his realm. 
Though nearly seven feet tall and well built, he has handsome and youthful 
features. His body habitus is that of a pure white centaur with the tail of a 
lion. His silver hooves sparkle constantly because of the unicorn-like horn on 
his brow. That horn is not made of hair as with most such protuberances, but is 
purely a thing of light. His long hair grows down his spine and ends in a 
glistening white mane which, with his pale skin, set off his beautiful green 
eyes.</font></p>

Born a woman of striking beauty, she now rules the Demi-Plane of Pain, a hot, 
damp and uncomfortable place with no flat surfaces on which to walk. Instead the 
ground is cluttered with small, closely placed, stalagmites of smooth obsidian. 
Saryrn busies herself by spending personal time with those cursed enough to live 
in her realm. She captures and torments her subjects mentally and physically and 
completely at random. The length of their torment before she releases them 
again, is also completely random - based mainly upon her whims. Those who fall 
into her hands may suffer but a few moments or for months at a time. All live 
with the fear that at any time, she may choose them as a partner.</font></p>

Known as the Beholder of Battle and as a master of strategy, Tallon Zek resides 
on the Plane of War along with his alter ego Vallon Zek. He is a tall, 
older-looking orc-like being, who appears to be very wise, with good cause. He 
wears a set of sturdy steel plate armor without a helm, and carries his famed 
obsidian war bow.</font></p>

Vallon Zek is a master tactician dubbed the Governor of War and, with his alter 
ego Tallon Zek, resides on the Plane of War with Rallos Zek. Vallon's 
manifestation is that of an older, muscular, physically strong male orc-like 
figure who wears blackened chain covered by an emerald and black cloak. His 
appearance is that of a regal general at arms, upright and stern, wise and 
aristocratic. At his belt, he bears a silvery saber, which he has been said to 
wave when explaining tactics to others. </font></p>

Mad</span> <br>
&nbsp;</b></font></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">
An Erudite by heritage, Vazaelle lived among those who were ousted from Erudin 
for necromancy. During her lifetime, she was a dedicated devout Cazicite, though 
a combination of religious zeal and prophetic visions stripped from her any 
semblance of sanity. Lifted up by her deity and given her own domain, the power 
of her madness shaped it into the semblance of old Paineel after its 
destruction. From her realm, Vazaelle occasionally foresees an event in the 
future of some unsuspecting Norrathian citizen, whose life will change 
drastically when that event occurs. Depending on the severity of Vazaelle's 
mental state during the vision, that poor individual will know some degree of 
madness for the rest of their days, suffering from the touch of Vazaelle the 
Mad. </font></p>

Forsaken</span> <br>
&nbsp;</b></font></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">
Zebuxoruk is neither evil nor good. Legends place him as evil and other legends 
untold place him on the side of good. To the other deities, they ALL dislike him 
or simply couldn't care less. Zebuxoruk was at some time in the form of mortal 
man and trod upon the surface of Norrath after escaping the Plane of Justice or 
the Void. Mortality was either something forced upon him or something he may 
have wished for. Zebuxoruk is known as the Forsaken One, The Disgraced and other 
such names among the pantheon of deities and heroes of the Outer Planes of 
Influence. </font></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">
There is said to be a hidden city on Norrath that honor, not worship, the 'Ungod', 
Zebuxoruk. Something not even he truly cares for. This city has knowledge of his 
history both true and false and the community is mostly comprised of fallen 
priests, shadowknight, paladins, any who have been forsaken by their deities and 
either seek a pathway back or seek true neutrality among the planes and and 
understanding that the deities are more mortal than they think.</font></p>
