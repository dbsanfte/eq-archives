<center><font size=+4><b><i>The Misty Thicket Picnic</i></b></font></center><p><br><hr><br><br>


<p><img src="mortar.jpg" align="left" width="49" height="49">The Misty Thicket Picnic is a great type of food. This Miraculous Meal (the longest lasting type of food) gives an extra STR 5, STA 5, WIS 5, INT  5, HP 20 and mana 30 to the diligent muncher, and all at only 0.1 weight. A worthwhile food for all. It is, however, a bugger to make. There are many, many subcombines all of which will eat up your inventory space, and will likely drive you round the bend while doing them aswell. Finding myself in short supply of other methods to reach my goal of 250, I decided that enough was enough, and that one way or another it was going to have to be picnics.</p><br>

Being the ruthlessly organised type when the mood takes me (but at no other time) I devised a routine to make picnics in bulk, in as easy and uncluttered way as possible. There are many fine guides out there by people detailing how to make the picnic, but for me there were too many words and not enough big arrows and boxes around things saying MAKE THIS ---->>>>>> DO THIS ------>>>> THEN DO THIS ----->>>>>. If I was going to be doing thousands of subcombines, my brain (and my eyes) wasn't going to be up to the task of sifting through paragraph after paragraph for the bit I actually needed, nestled in amongst some flowery description. SO, all the descriptive bit here will be at the beginning, and each Sub-item will be blocked off into it's own little clearly marked area, with the recipes and subcombines in tables. Any notes on the specific sections will likely come after each separate table.<p><br>


<b><font size=+1>TAKE NOTE:</b></font> This method of making picnics will provide you with enough materials to do 100 final picnic combines. It will eat up a crapload of inventory and bank space, and be made more difficult by the fact that you do still need room to buy ingredients for the next sub-item and also have room to combine them, and put the subcombines for the subitem you just made. Before the Legacy of Ykesha expansion which gave us twice as much bank space, I used to have to use a mule on my second account, on my second PC, so I had somewhere to put the finished sub-items while I made the next set. Once I got the increased bank space (and before I filled it up with more junk) I didn't need to use him any more.<p><br>

I would estimate that you would need to have maybe 5 10-slot bags available just for storage and another couple available for working space in your inventory (you will also need a mixing bowl at some point). So if you can clean out some room in the bank, DO IT or you wont have room. Also, you will soon begin to fill up on successful picnic combines. These don't sell for much to a vendor, but they go well in the bazaar for anything from 5pp each to 30pp. Vendor them, flog them, give them away, give each of your alts a lifetime's supply, but you don't want to keep hold of too many of them, or you'll be running out of room again (each success makes 4 picnics).<p><br>

<b><font size=+1>ALSO</b></font> You will need some basic skill in Smithing (up to about 50 is good), Tailoring (around 80 is good, but easy) and Brewing (162 ok that's not quite so basic, but check out my brewing guide). I do recommend that where possible you look to buy a couple extra ingredients for each combine, because somewhere along the line you're going to fail and not have quite enough. This is annoying.

<p><img src="mortar.jpg" align="left" width="49" height="49">Anyway. Now that you know you (a) Need a lot of room (b) Need mostly minor skill in a couple of other tradeskills (c) will be doing a LOT of combines, we are ready to begin making our picnic. Once into the swing of things, I was preparing 100 picnic combines in about an hour, with the minimum of fuss. The Plane of Knowledge is a good place for this as it has many of the items and stationary tradeskill containers you will be needing. It may seem hard at first, and more work than you want to be doing, but when I was getting a skill up every 30 or so combines (3 per session) life looked a lot better (from often going 60 or more combines on other recipes per skill up, and using mob dropped items). Good luck!</p><br>

<b>To make 200 Slices of jumjum Cake =</b><p>
You only need 1 successful Cake combine. You bet your ass that even as a master baker you are going to manage to somehow fail to slice a cake, and completely ruin it in the process. Make an extra stack, you won't regret it.<p><br>

<b>Eggs</b> can be gotten all over the place either foraged or dropped from mobs.<p>

<b>Brownie Parts</b> unsurprisingly drop off Brownies. If you are not advanced in levels hunt the little ones in Greater Fay or in Steamfont. If you don't mind getting your arse handed to you at round level 30 or so, hunt them Lesser Faydark. If you are looking for bloody vengeance for past crimes perpetrated by the little buggers, go to any of these places. Alternatively, go to the bazaar.
<p>
<b>Jumjum Stalks</b> can be bought from Daleena Leafsway in Rivervale near the Druid guild, or in Shadowhaven from Alorob Bolrodo located in the halfling district, in the Lost Turnip.
