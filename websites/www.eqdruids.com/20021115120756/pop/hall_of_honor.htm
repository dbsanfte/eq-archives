  Paralin Notion says 'We're a part of the Battalion of Marr. We're soldiers 
  from Che Virtuson. We were dispatched to this part of the Plane of Valor to 
  eliminate an age old target. Unfortunately, due to some recent events our

  Paralin Notion says 'We are apart of Ducee Tapferson. Our squad is known for

  <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700"><br>
  Paralin Notion says 'The Trials are overseen by the Heroes of Marr. It's these 
  Trials that allow us to rise in rank. Only those who have passed the trials 
  are able to enter the Temple of Marr. Now if you wish to aid us I must ask you 
  to do a few [things].'</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">

  Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln looks you over and says in a deep voice 'What 
  could you possibly do to aid our cause. Perhaps you think you can slay [Aerin`Dar] 
  himself?' The Master Sergeant begins to laugh uncontrollably.' I suggest you 
  go back to whoever filled your head with this nonsense and stop wasting my 
  time.'</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">

  <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700"><br>
  Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln says 'I don't have time to explain the glass

  <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700"><br>
  Paralin Notion says 'I'm sorry the Master Sergeant was unable to help you. 
  Perhaps you should [prove] yourself before you attempt to jump 'into the fire' 
  so to speak.'</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700"><br>

  <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700"><br>
  Paralin Notion says 'We've been running into a lot of problems lately with the 
  razorfiends and the planarian larvae. Many soldiers have been getting sick 
  because of the infestations that they cause. Capture the hearts of a 
  razorfiend, a crystalline spider and a planarian larvae and bring them back to 
  me. Our squad had enough problems capturing this small razorfiend here. This 
  will become your first so called 'Trial' Finnien. It should be enough to prove 
  your worth.'<br>
  <br>
  Once you have collected the three hearts and turned them in...<br>
  <br>
  Paralin Notion looks at you with surprise. 'Very good my friend. You've 
  definitely proven yourself. Find the Master Sergeant. He should be able to 
  help you this time.</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700"><br>
  You gain experience!!<br>

  <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700"><br>
  Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln says 'I heard what you did for Paralin Notion. 
  That's quite a noble feat indeed. Perhaps we can use your help. However, 
  you'll need to talk to the Captain first. Afterall, I can't have you walking 
  in the [glass lair] without permission.'</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700"><br>

  <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700"><br>
  Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln says 'It's the prison that [Aerin`Dar] has been

  <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700"><br>
  Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln says 'Aerin`Dar is the crystalline dragon who 
  once roamed the Plane of Valor. During a severe rainstorm it was struck down 
  to the very core of it's being. The mighty Aerin`Dar fell from the sky and 
  landed in what is now known as the Glassy Wasteland. Planarian larvae began to 
  infest it's body eventually turning it's pure heart to evil. Our [company] was 
  dispatched to this region of Valor to eliminate the threat.'</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">

  <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700"><br>
  Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln says 'My squad of men are a part of Che 
  Virtuson. However, we specifically are a part of Ducee Buled. We fall under 
  the command of Captain Ryglot. Our [mission], for the time being, is simple. 
  But we've run into some problems lately.'</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700"><br>
  You say, 'What mission'</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700"><br>
  Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln says 'Not to fast Finnien. You'll have to speak 
  to the Captain about that. I'm not at liberty to divulge that information at 
  this time. That information is classified. I can tell you, but then I'd have 
  to kill you.' Aaramis laughs. 'Go to Captain Ryglot and he'll be able to fill 
  you in with all the details.'<br>
  <br>
  Captain Ryglot Cupperhide says 'I am very [busy] at the moment. Perhaps you 
  should come back at another time Finnien.'</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700"><br>
  You say, 'Why are you busy'</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700"><br>
  Captain Ryglot Cupperhide says 'I can't go into any great detail, but the 
  Crystalline Globe was taken from our command structure. Its believed to have 
  been separated into three pieces. Unfortunately, we're having a lot of trouble 
  relocating it. Perhaps you'd like to [help].'</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700"><br>
  You say, 'I will help'</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700"><br>
  Captain Ryglot Cupperhide says 'That's good to hear Finnien. I wish we had 
  more soldiers like yourself willing to help. I'm going to need you to locate 
  the missing pieces of the globe and bring them back to me. After you've 
  acquired the pieces perhaps you'd be able to rally enough people to lend us a 
  hand with another [mission] objective we've been unable to fulfill do to our 
  diminished numbers.'</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700"><br>
  You say, 'What mission?'</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700"><br>
  Captain Ryglot Cupperhide says 'Well, I can't go into any details as to our 
  main purpose is, but one of our missions was to exterminate the crystalline 
  dragon. However, due to our company being split we are unable to go forward 
  with this part of the operation. It has been placed on hold, pending the 
  outcome of the [war].'</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700"><br>
  You say, 'What war?'</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700"><br>
  Captain Ryglot Cupperhide says 'Unfortunately, that is one of the things that 
  I'm unable to speak of at this time. However, if you are [willing] to help 
  rally some people together I may be able to release some more information to 
  you.'<br>
  <br>
  One crystalline orb piece drops off of the Luminii Crawler, one drops off 
  frogs near the bridgehouse, and one drops off of the skellies. Once the 
  Captain recieves the three pieces of the orb, he gives you back the completed 
  orb, which is the key to Aerin'Dar's lair.<br>
  <br>
  Aerin'Dar hits for approximately 1400, is slowable, and has an AE on a -150 MR 
  check, that does 3k dd, and 45% melee slow. He also has nine mobs in his room 
  that add as you fight him, and are level 63 and mezzable by the Sleep spell.</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
