You say, 'I will slay the Necromancer' <br>
<br>
Yeolarn Bronzeleaf says 'The Fier'Dal rangers that inhabit the Lesser Faydark 
have spotted a courier making deliveries to the Teir'Dal camp near Castle 
Mistmoore and to a necromancer that lingers near the ancient obelisk. We believe 
that the crates he carries are supplies needed for the creation of more Ghasts. 
Another shipment should be arriving soon. Seek out the necromancer at the 
obelisk and take his head then take the head of the courier and return them to 
me with the crate that the courier carries and your Initiate Symbol of Tunare.

Yeolarn Bronzeleaf says 'I require the head of the necromancer, the head of the 
courier, the crate the courier carries and your Initiate Symbol' <br>
<br>
Bring the two heads and the crate back to Yeolarn. <br>
<br>
Yeoolarn Bronzeleaf says 'Praise Tunare! The Mother smiles on you this day 
Disciple Angelsyn! I present you with the symbol of your new station among the 
Priests of Tunare. Return to me when you are ready to become a [Warden of 
Tunare]. <br>

You gain party experience!! <br>
