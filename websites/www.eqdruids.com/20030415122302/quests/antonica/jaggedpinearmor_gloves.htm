  Gloves</font></b></p><p><font face="Arial">You say, 'I wish to acquire gloves' <br>
  <br>
  Cheyloh Greenwood says 'A most wise choice, friend. You must continue to 
  uphold the sacred duties that you have pledged your existence to and thus gain 
  nature's recognition and full acceptance to fulfill this task. The items I am 
  in need of so that I might properly weave the gloves are Polished Jade Studs 
  and Forest Woven Gloves. The Polished Jade Studs you will find in the Potameid 
  Caves, where much of our sacred jade ornaments have found their way by the 
  fates of the thieves and poachers who infest this land and frequently raid our 
  homes. Our scouts believe the Potameid Matriarchs to hold the jade studs, and 
  I would heed their advice to discourage any unnecessary danger to you. The 
  Forest Woven Gloves will require further aid from a member of the Jaggedpine 
  to obtain. Seek out my beloved, Lerian in the Surefall Glade and inquire to 
  him about the gloves. He will know who has sent you and the full details of 
  the task before you.'' <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what are forest woven gloves?' <br>
  <br>
  Lerian Wyndrunner says 'The gloves you seek to acquire will take much patience 
  and perseverance on your behalf to be successful in obtaining. I can guide you 
  as to who and what you must seek and give you the proper instructions to 
  fulfill your part before I can give the final touch to creating the Forest 
  Woven Gloves. The task you must fulfill before returning to me to complete the 
  final process in the item's creation is to use your own mastery in the ways of 
  tailoring to create the Blackened Mithril Netted Gloves. There are two 
  components for this item -- one is the Tattered Panther Hide Gloves, which you 
  will likely find upon a renegade poacher known as Theoris Bladespur, who the 
  scouts of the Glade have informed me currently resides in South Karana. The 
  second item is the [Blackened Mithril Netting].'' </font> </p><p>

  You say, 'what is blackened mithril netting?' </font> </p><p>
  <font face="Arial">Lerian Wyndrunner says 
  'This material is new to the creation of the gloves, as the resource we had 
  once used grows dangerously scarce. I have spoken with the craftsman of Qeynos 
  and they have given me the knowledge of the Blackened Mithril, which can be 
  found in the clutches of the kobold king's guard who resides in Solusek's Eye. 
  The artisans of Qeynos say that the Blackened Mithril is light and its ability 
  to hold an enchantment is unsurpassed by anything they have yet to find on 
  Antonica, making it suitable for our intentions of creating this item. Once 
  you have successfully made the Blackened Mithril Netted Gloves, you will need 
  to return them to me with the Shadowjade Moss and Shadowjade Fern Leaves, both 
  of which you can safely procure in the Jaggedpine, if the forest will allow 
  you take of it.'' <br>
  <br>
  The blackened mithril netting drops off a kobold advisor, also in the king 
  area of solb. the advisor is a light blue to 60 shaman. He's either immune to 
  changes in run speed or so resistant as to make little difference. </font> </p><p>
  <font face="Arial">Theoris Bladespur is roughly the same lvl/difficulty as Fitorrin, and spawns 
  in East Karana at the bandit camp by the druid ring.</font></p><p>
  <font face="Arial">&nbsp;Combining the 
  blackened mithril netting and tattered panther hide gloves in a large sewing 
  kit results in Blackened mithril netted gloves, and isn't trivial at 165.
  </font> </p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Handing the blackened mithril netted gloves, 1 shadow jade fern leaf, and 1 
  shadowjade moss to Lerian results in Forest Woven Gloves (5ac, 10hp, 10mana).</font></p>
