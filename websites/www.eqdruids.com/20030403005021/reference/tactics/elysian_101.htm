    <p><b><font face="Arial"><u>Elysian Hunting 101</u></font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial">So you want to solo (or at least hunt) disturbed 
    elysian remains in Umbral Plains?&nbsp; Well let’s see if I can quell some of the 
    many questions that are posted here repeatedly.</font></b></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <font face="Arial">
        <li><b>Worth of the Armor: This armor is well worth the time needed to 
        invest in receiving it. I guess you could call Elysian armor the “uber 
        armor of the non-uber druid.” You do not need a large guild to raid for 
        this armor. More often than not if you have some decent gear, some wits, 
        skill, and KEI, you can solo these MOBs.<br>
        <br>
&nbsp;</b></li>
        <li><b>A second commonly asked question I’ve seen is can you solo the 
        elysians at 53 with ______ or without _____. &nbsp;Well, the answer is yes. 
        At 53, as long as you have decent mana (probably 2200 or 2300 at the 
        least) and some KEI, you can solo here – but you MUST be careful. Last 
        night, I myself just dinged 54, and I would imagine ¾’s of my experience 
        towards that level came from Elysians, grouping and soloing. You do NOT, 
        I repeat, do NOT need the Warden’s Symbol of Tunare or your 
        epic….however, they would help a lot. I personally have neither, and had 
        no problems whatsoever. You should know that conventional druid root is 
        very very unreliable. You will need at least Clarity 2 or KEI to do this 
        solo at 53. Root (if you do not have the Warden’s Symbol) will eat a 
        good portion of your mana, especially the lower the Elysian's HP become. 
        Lastly, there is one item you most definitely need. A manaless DoT item 
        such as the Elder Spiritist’s Vambraces or Rowyl’s Bracer of Nature is a 
        must. Even with the epic, every little bit of damage helps speed up the 
        process. More kills = more drops. At 53 it took 11 minutes to kill ONE 
        Elysian solo. That was with 10 casts of Winged Death, 10 casts of Drones 
        of Doom (from my Elder Spiritists Vambraces), and one cast of Drifting 
        Death. Add all that up with anywhere from 5 to 25 casts of Engulfing 
        Roots (160 damage a pop as well) and you have little time to meditate 
        and a lot of spells to cast to deal around 20,000 HP’s of damage. Fun, 
        eh?<br>
        <br>
&nbsp;</b></li>
        <li><b>So you want to know how often the armor drops? In my experiences, 
        the armor drop rate is about one in every four kills. Keep in mind, 
        however, that the same Elysian can (and WILL) often drop multiple items. 
        Some will disagree, I am sure, but the rarest item (this is my own 
        opinion from experience and experience received from other druids) is 
        the Elysian Crown. I’ve killed over a hundred or more Elysians 
        altogether, and have yet to see the crown. The tunic and armplates also 
        seem to be rarer than the rest. As for the spell drops – Foliage Shield 
        and Spirit of the Eagle are the only two druid spells I have seen (FS 
        twice and SoE once) drop from Elysians. Some say they replace armor 
        drops as loot, but that is not the case. I saw armor (legs with SoE, 
        gauntlets with FS) two of those three times. Gems are the on the spawns 
        about half of the time.</b></li>

    </blockquote>
    <p><b><font face="Arial">Now for those finding out about this armor for the 
    first time, here are some (vague) directions to get to Umbral Plains and the 
    safe spot/camp. (Someone please retrieve these /loc’s as I am typing this on 
    the go.)</font></b></p>
    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <font face="Arial">
        <li><b>First, you need to gate to Dawnshroud Peaks. Invis yourself at 
        the gate in point and head south for a few feet (past the run-down house 
        thing) and then go Southeast. You will see a tunnel ahead and slightly 
        to the left. Go there and zone, you have entered Maiden’s Eye. <br>
        &nbsp;</b></li>
        <li><b>Refresh invis and head along the right wall (yes I know there are 
        faster ways, but this is the route I prefer), continue until you see an 
        off white octagonal structure in the distance. AVOID THAT STRUCTURE!! 
        Creatures around that structure Harm Touch for 750 HP a pop --- OUCH! 
        Cut across the field past the structure and rejoin the right wall. 
        Continue on it until you come to what looks like to be a Horn either 
        sticking out of the air or out of the ground (sometimes it’s appears to 
        be one to me, sometimes it appears to be another) and a tunnel. Stay 
        invis and run past the Mobs here and you have entered Umbral Plains. <br>
        &nbsp;</b></li>
        <li><b>Once in Umbral, levitate and re-invis and stay high on the right 
        wall. You will come to a temple, go around it and get back on the right 
        wall. You have now entered the safe valley. Personally I bound high up 
        on the wall in the middle for a few reasons. One – if I die I am near my 
        corpse. Two – when I have KEI or have to get KEI, I can always gate 
        right back in and be ready to kill. Thirdly, and most important – you 
        can Egress or Succor if things go south, then just gate back to your 
        camp.</b></li>
        </font>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b><font face="Arial">The place you pull from is just ahead on the right 
    wall, stay high on that wall and look down into the valley there, catch the 
    wanderer’s, and ONLY the wanderer’s. Avoid anything that isn’t Elysian, 
    cause there’s a good chance it summons faster than you can Egress. Snare the 
    Mobs and pull them SLOWLY back to camp – safest bet would be to only pull 
    yellows or under – but most that I killed at 53 were reds. The pathing near 
    the corner of the camp/safe area is HORRIBLE near one certain tree (you will 
    see what I mean), so you may need to take a hit or two (keep 
    Chloroplast/Regrowth ON) to get it to cross that line. That’s about all for 
    pulling.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial">My personal opinion is, if you are going to group, 
    go ALL druid. Don’t be selfish. The loot will come quicker grouped than 
    solo, promise ya that. Another nice group I was in was Enchanter, Cleric, 
    Druid (me), Monk, Ranger, and Warrior.&nbsp; DoT the MOB, thorn the tanks, heal 
    the enchanter and monk. Also have been in a Druid (me), Necro, Warrior, 
    Cleric, Enchanter group. Was also very nice.<br>
    <br>
    All in all there are many ways to get your Elysian, from waiting for /ooc’s 
    of rotting armor to grouping, to soloing. There are only three key rules:<br>
&nbsp;</font></b></p>
    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <font face="Arial">
        <li><b>Be safe – if things turn sour, don’t be afraid to boogy on out of 
        there.<br>
        &nbsp;</b></li>
        <li><b>Don’t be greedy, your druid friends won’t want to help if you win 
        all the loot, SHARE THE WEALTH!!<br>
        &nbsp;</b></li>
        <li><b>Have fun, the EXP solo is great, and grouped isn’t half bad. The 
        loot is awesome, and it’s a challenging fight. What more can ya ask for?</b></li>
        </font>
      </ol>
