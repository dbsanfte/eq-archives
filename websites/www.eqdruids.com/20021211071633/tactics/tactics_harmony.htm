It is an area-effect lull spell which decreases the radius of the NPCs aggro range. In short, if you harmony a group of NPCs and then attack one, the rest will not attack when they otherwise would have.</p><p>
  Due to recent changes to the Harmony line, you can only use Harmony on a level 
  40 or lower mob.</p><p>After that, you will need to use the Harmony of Nature 
  spell.&nbsp; Harmony of nature is not a group spell, and does have a slight 
  chance of being resisted.</p><p><u>There are differences between Harmony and the Lull line of spells</u>: <ul><li>Harmony is outdoor-only, whereas Lull can be cast indoors. <li>Druids acquire Harmony at level 5. Lull is generally acquired at level 1. <li>Harmony is area-effect, whereas Lull is single-target (enchanters do get an area-effect lull, but not until level 51). <li>Harmony is Druid and Ranger only, whereas Lull can be used by Clerics, Enchanters, and Paladins. <li>Harmony has a low resist rate, whereas Lull is resisted often. <li>Harmony does not cause 
    agro if resisted. Lull does, making it used rarely as it will agro all targets in the camp. <li>There is no upgrade to Harmony. Lull has a few upgrades (Soothe, Calm, and Wake of Tranquility).</ul><p>It's single greatest use is in that it allows you to pull targets from a camp in a controlled manner, instead of having the entire camp come crashing down upon you or your party.</p><p>Harmony does not appear to have any level restrictions. This means that it can be used for a druid's entire lifetime, from level 5 till 60. It is also not limited to any particular type of monster, so it is equally effective against summoned, undead, animal, plant, and normal targets.</p><p>Harmony does emit a &quot;glow&quot; when cast. There are no messages given indicating whether the cast was successful, but if it is resisted, a message will appear. Also, if you are within range of the target, you can get caught in the area effect. But it doesn't affect you negatively in any way, so don't worry. In order to see the glow, you will need to be fairly close to the target. This only becomes a problem if you are normally KOS to the target. You'll need to find a safe range to cast the spell, and rely on the fact that it is rarely resisted.</p><p>Harmony is not 100% reliable. In cases where two NPCs in a camp are too close together (usually side by side), the spell does not reduce the 
  agro radius enough to separate them.</p><p>Typically Harmony is cast first on the target you <u>don't</u> want to pull. Upon successful cast, the target you do want to pull is brought to the group using a normal pull spell, such as snare or a debuff. An example of where this is effective is the first Orc camp in East Commonlands. Typically there are 5 - 6 orcs present in the camp. A typical mistake that groups hunting there make is to not use harmony to separate the camp. If they are the first to &quot;break&quot; the camp, they will surely be overwhelmed.</p><p>A druid with Harmony can make breaking this camp <b>infinitely</b> easier.</p><p>A druid can indicate to the main puller which target he should pull to the group. Then, the druid begins to cast harmony on the target(s) that he wants to leave at the camp. Once the druid is finished harmonizing the other targets, he will signal to the puller to attack the intended target. The Orc is brought to the group and dispatched quickly. Provided the encounter was not too difficult, the puller can pull another target immediately as the effects of harmony lasts for two minutes. If not, the druid and puller can simply repeat.</p><p><u>Additional examples of where Harmony is effective</u>: <ul><li>Orc and goblin camps in Misty Thicket <li>Dervish camps in North and South Ro, West Commons and Oasis <li>Orc camps in Greater Faydark <li>Bandit camps in the Karanas <li>Ogre camp in West Karana <li>Spectre in Ocean of Tears <li>Skeleton camps in Rathe Mountains <li>Sarnak camps in The Overthere <li>Giant fort in Frontier Mountains and 
    Warslik's Woods <li>...and several others...</ul><p>Groups hunting in <a href=../reference/indoors_outdoors.htm>outdoor zones</a> will generally prefer harmony over lull because of it's high success rate. This makes druids (and rangers) very desirable when attempting to hunt at difficult camps, and makes us effective pullers.</p></TABLE></CENTER></table></center></font><p align=justify><a href=../reference/library.htm>Back to Main</a><br> &nbsp;</p></td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr></table><!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table><!--msnavigation--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td><p align=center style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size=1>All information contained on this website copyright Thistlethorne Enterprises 2001-2002.&nbsp; Everquest copyright Sony Inc.</font></p></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table></body></html>
