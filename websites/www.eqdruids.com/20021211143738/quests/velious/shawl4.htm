  <b><font face="Arial">After finishing the first three quests, ask Loremaster 
  Borannin 'What is brewing?' <br>
  <br>
  Loremaster Borannin says 'Ahh yes, good to see you again Maeve . I wish it

  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <b><font face="Arial">For some time now we have sent teams of our finest 
  rogues to gather intelligence for the Dain. Tanik Greskil is one of our best. 
  He was recently sent into the heart of Kael Drakkel on a very important 
  mission and has not returned. He is now long overdue, and fearing the worst, 
  our wise council has asked me to dispatch a rescue party to determine what has 
  become of him and return him to safety. I have decided to give you this 
  opportunity to build upon the trust you have earned from the council. Will you 
  accept this mission? <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'I will accept this mission' <br>
  <br>
  Loremaster Borannin says 'The council will be pleased to hear of your 
  acceptance. Scour the regions surrounding the city of the Giants. Discover 
  what happened to Tanik and, if possible, return him to Thurgadin. If you are 
  successful, remember to hand me your woven shawl. We seem to be running low on 
  them, but I must say Mordin has never had so much help in the kitchen. Anyway, 
  I will eagerly await word of your findings. Good luck, and may Brell protect 
  you. <br>
&nbsp;</font></b><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <b><font face="Arial">Now go to the Entrance of Kael Drakkel in Eastern 
  Wastes.&nbsp; You will need to find Tanik Greskil.&nbsp; He is a &quot;trap&quot; in the 
  snow.</font></b><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <b><font face="Arial">To find him, take a no drop item in your hand, and start 
  clicking around the snow.&nbsp; You will eventually receive the message that 
  you are too far away to give that item.&nbsp; Keep narrowing it down until you 
  spring the trap.</font></b><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <b><font face="Arial">Now you will either spring the &quot;Tanik&quot; trap, or the 
  Death Squad trap.&nbsp; If you spring the death squad (2 fairly nasty giants) 
  just run into Kael Drakkel.</font></b><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <b><font face="Arial"><br>
  If you find the &quot;Tanik&quot; trap you will receive the message &quot;the snow crumbles 
  away revealing an injured coldain.&quot; This reveals Tanik Greskil.<br>
  <br>
  You say, 'Hail, Tanik Greskil' <br>
  <br>
  Tanik Greskil says 'Outlander! Thank Brell you've found me! I am the last 
  surviving member of my unit. Our mission was somehow compromised, the bloody 
  Kromrif knew just where to find us... I can't imagine how they knew. I was 
  barely able to escape with my life and wandered into a trap here. I am badly 
  hurt and need your help.<br>
  <br>
  You say, 'I will help' <br>
  <br>
  Tanik Greskil says 'Quickly, give me a vial of Veluim Vapors so I can return 
  home, I am in desperate need of some attention from our clerics.<br>
  <br>
  You say, 'What are velium vapors?' <br>
  <br>
  Tanik Greskil says 'Drat! Are you telling me you don't have one with you? Run 
  back to Thurgadin at once and speak with Frundle, she can make you one. I will 
  do what I can to stay alive. I may need to move about a bit to keep from being 
  discovered. Hurry now outlander, you're my only hope.<br>
  <br>
  Once back in Thurgadin, find Frundle. <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'Hail, Frundle Frenklar' <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'What velium vapors?' <br>
  <br>
  Frundle Frenklar says 'Ahh, you come seeking my family recipe? After all 
  you've done for our people it's the least I can do. First you must fashion a 
  velium vial, then combine the vial with two small pieces of velium in this 
  jar. That's all there is to it. Please keep the recipe a secret.<br>
  <br>
  You say, 'What velium vial?' <br>
  <br>
  Frundle Frenklar says 'I'm no potter mind you, but if I remember correctly 
  it's a small brick of velium, three crystalline silks, and two glass shards. 
  Then you'll have to finish up by firing it in a kiln with a high quality 
  firing sheet.<br>
  <br>
  Small Pieces of Velium and Small Blocks of Velium can be looted on Ry’Gorr 
  Minors in Crystal Caverns or off spiders in Velketor's Labyrinth.<br>
  <br>
  Crystalline Silk can be found on spiders in both zones. <br>
  <br>
  1) Combine a small (7 lb) brick of velium, three unstacked crystalline silks 
  and two glass shards in a pottery wheel. You will receive an Unfired Velium 
  Vial.<br>
  <br>
  2) Combine the Unfired Velium Vial and a HQ firing sheet in the kiln and 
  receive a Velium Vial.</font></b><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <b><font face="Arial"><br>
  3) Combine the Velium Vial and two unstacked small pieces of Velium in the 
  Velium purifier. The Velium Purifier disappears and you are left with a Vial 
  of Velium Vapors. The vial is a lore item and has one charge of gate to 
  Thurgadin.<br>
  <br>
  The vial is trivial at skill 130. <br>
  <br>
  You can have this vial made ahead of time.&nbsp; You don't need to talk to 
  Tanik first.&nbsp; Saves you having to find him two times.<br>
  <br>
  Tanik Greskil says 'Thank you. I shall be eternally grateful to you. Should 
  you ever require my assistance I pledge to you my aid. Please deliver this to 
  Borannin, it is imperative that he deliver this to the Dain at once. Farewell 
  for now outlander...<br>
  <br>
  You gain experience!! <br>
  <br>
  Then head back to Thurgadin and hand Borannin the note and your old shawl, for 
  the new shawl. <br>
  <br>
  Loremaster Borannin says 'Words cannot express our gratitude for your deeds 
  outlander, you have saved a hero of our people from certain death. Please 
  accept this, the Fur-lined shawl, as a token of our sincere appreciation. You 
  are indeed among the most highly regarded Humans to set foot in Thurgadin. The 
  next time we meet be sure to ask me how to further advance your reputation 
  with the coldain.</font></b><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
