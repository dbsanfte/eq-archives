    <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">You say, 'Hail, Jalil' <br> <br> Jalil says 'Oh, hello there. Thank you for stopping by, but this is just not a very good time for visitors. My daughter is very upset over what has happened. <br> <br> You say, 'what has happened?' <br> <br> Jalil looks up and says, 'Oh my, I thought everyone had heard by now. Behari has gone missing. Been quite some time now, in fact. Even the king had gotten involved in the search for him, but...' Jalil lowers his voice to a whisper so as not to upset his daughter, 'everyone has about given up hope. Soroush was the last we know of that had seen him, but he had very little helpful information.' <br> <br> You say, 'who is soroush?' <br> <br> Jalil says 'Soroush has taken over Behari's duties... temporarily, at least. He can usually be found right in the throne room in case he is needed. <br> <br> You say, 'Hail, Kalila' <br> <br> Kalila looks up from her teary handkerchief, the deepest sadness visible in her eyes, 'I am very sorry, but I am not very good company at the moment. I fear my love will never return.' <br> <br> You say, 'Hail, Liorra Sha Kerrath' <br> <br> You say, 'Hail, Soroush' <br> <br> Soroush says 'Greetings to you. I have just returned from another trip to Katta Castellum and am trying to organize my notes, I apologize that I've little time to talk. Everything happened so suddenly what with the odd circumstances surrounding the last diplomat, I have not quite had time to get used to my new post. <br> <br> You say, 'who is behari?' <br> <br> Soroush pauses to find the right words, 'Behari, the last to hold this post, disappeared on his last trip to Katta. He was a friend of mine for some time, I never dreamed that I would have to undertake his duties in this way. I believe that I was the last to see him alive. His behavior at the time seemed peculiar, but I shrugged it off as simply a man blissfully in love,' he says with a heavy sigh, and adds somberly, 'I was very happy for him.' <br> <br> You say, 'what behavior?' <br> <br> Soroush Koroun says 'I never mentioned this to Kalila, I thought it would hurt her more than it would help, but when I bumped into Behari just before he disappeared, he was going on and on about a love potion of some sort. He was very excited, said he thought it would be the perfect gift for Kalila on their wedding night, so you see why I never mentioned it. Anyway, he said that he had just gathered all of the ingredients and was heading back out of Katta. <br> <br> You say, 'what love potion?' <br> <br> Soroush Koroun says 'I have no idea what he meant by a 'love potion.' I have never even heard of such a thing, it just isn't my field, I am afraid. Maybe one of the spiritists knows something about it. I doubt that it will do anything to help you track down Behari, but I wish you luck my friend. <br> <br> You say, 'love potion?' <br> <br> Spiritist Ragnar says 'Love potion? Never been done and not worth the risk to try after what happened to Kanaad. <br> <br> You say, 'What happened to Kanaad?' <br> <br> Spiritist Ragnar says 'Old Kanaad taught me a lot of what I know- he was about the greatest potions expert in the city back then. He started gathering legends and lore about some infamous love potion. Not some silly thing to make the girl of your dreams fall in love mind you- this fabled tonic was intended to be shared only between two who had found true love. If their feelings were strong enough it would... well, that was part of the problem, no one knew what it was supposed to do. Kanaad learned of some crazy human in the mountains that had supposedly figured out the secret to the potion. The results were not what anyone had hoped for. <br> <br> You say, 'What were the results?' <br> <br> Spiritist Ragnar shuffles a bit uncomfortably, considering whether or not he should be telling you this, 'This is not something that I would normally talk about, but Soroush came by and told me that you are on the trail of Behari- if this will help you find him, then I will tell you all that I know... Kanaad had a time getting the ingredients and was only to make just a very little bit. He sat down with his love, alone in a room and intended to share the elixir. Well, that was the last anyone saw of her, and he was manic, out of his mind... The mixture had driven him from his senses and he snapped. It took quite a bit to restrain him and figure out what to do next.' <br> <br> You say, 'What happened next?' <br> <br> Spiritist Ragnar considers you for a moment and, as though reminding himself that you are trustworthy, continues, 'Well what we learned was that not only did the mixture drive the drinker mad, but it was incredibly addictive as well- a horrible combination. All that we could do was give him a controlled intake of the potion for his addiction and try to treat his dementia. With his returning sanity came the realization of what he had done to his love. It was the most harrowing thing I have ever seen someone go through in all of my life... He is better now, but has never quite been the same and rarely speaks to strangers. Give him this and you should at least get a chance to explain.' <br> <br> You say, 'yes, I want to know about hoober' <br> <br> Kanaad says, 'I will try not to repeat what Ragnar has already told you.' After taking a deep breath, clearly taxed by the memories, he continues, 'My research had brought me to Katta Castellum. After a long day's work I took a seat at the end of the bar in a local pub. Trying to get my mind off of potions for a while, I overheard a story about a crazy man roaming Tenebrous Mountains. Everyone seemed to know him as Hoober the Delirious. Seems he had become something of a local legend for his very odd habit of asking people to gather some rather obscure ingredients in exchange for a very rare reward.' <br> <br> You say, 'what ingredients?' <br> <br> Kanaad says 'The promise of true love and everlasting happiness can make even the most scarce ingredients seem trivial. People laughed him off as a lunatic and after finally meeting Hoober I could easily tell why, but his story piqued my interest given my current... project. I asked the fellows to repeat the ingredients this man requested, but they were drinking rather heavily and had paid little attention in the first place. They were very vague, but what they could remember sounded very similar to a partial recipe I had found a record of earlier that very day. Against my better judgment I sought out this wanderer and we had a most interesting conversation. <br> <br> You say, 'conversation?' <br> <br> Kanaad gently closes his eyes and paints a picture in his mind, 'There was no denying the man's state of mind, he was utterly delirious. That was why I was so convinced...' he drifts off, 'so convinced...' <br> <br> You say, 'convinced of what?' <br> <br> Kanaad says 'At this notion, he takes a deep breath and opens his eyes to look at you once more, 'you see when he finally did tell me of the things he was looking for, he was eloquent, impassioned, unmistakably controlled. He knew what he was talking about, it seemed like this had to be it, the answer to what I was seeking. So I gathered up the components and combined them myself, and then it all went so horribly wrong...' It takes him a moment to regain his train of thought, 'You wouldn't even be able to have an intelligible conversation with this man due to the crippling nature of the addiction unless someone made you up a batch.' <br> <br> You say, 'can you make a batch?' <br> <br> Kanaad glances nervously about, 'I am not sure that I should, the temptation would... perhaps Ragnar could... no he hasn't experience with this mixture.' Kanaad seems to wrack his brain for alternatives, silent for a long moment. His inner conflict evident, he steadies himself for what he is about to do, 'I suppose that I am the only one who can mix this potion for you properly. I can... yes, I have no doubt that I will be fine.' His inner demons put somewhat out of his mind, Kanaad looks you straight in the eyes and says, 'I will need a Luclin clover, a drop of moonlight and some essence of sonnet.' <br> <br> You say, 'luclin clover?' <br> <br> Kanaad says 'The Luclin clover is in many ways just like any other ordinary clover, but the ones that grow out in the Thicket seem to posses an extra sensitivity to magic and enchantment. <br> <br> You say, 'drop of moonlight?' <br> <br> Kanaad says 'A drop of moonlight is exactly that- not solid, not liquid but a captured drop of light itself. Any astrologer worth their salt will be able to harness one for you. Dont know much about astrology myself, but I'd guess that the platforms above the palace would be an ideal place from which to see the stars. <br> <br> You say, 'Hail, Nayantara Tarana' <br> <br> Nayantara Tarana didn't notice you until you spoke, 'Hrmm? Oh, hello there, Tennari. I have to say, Norrath getting closer lately has been pretty to watch, but now that thrill has worn off, it really gets in the way of seeing the stars behind it. Trying to divine the will of spirits from astral patterns and nebular activity is a lot easier without a planet in your face,' she chuckles. <br> <br> You say, 'drop of moonlight?' <br> <br> Nayantara Tarana says, 'Under normal circumstances I am happy to sell a drop of moonlight- it is one of the few ways for an Astrologer to make any money,' she chuckles. 'Problem right now is that my telescope is out of commission and trying to harness a drop of moonlight without a telescope is rather akin to trying to catch a fish with your bare hands, know what I mean?' Laughing heartily at her own joke, she continues, 'Anyway, if you want, I would be happy to trade you a fresh drop of moonlight for a new reflective shard. You may need to head to the Geerloks in Katta for one though, I do not believe anyone sells them locally. <br> <br> **Geerlok is a gnome down in the Tinker Area in the bottom level of Katta. Go down the stairs then through the left opening guarded by the short people. Follow the big(as opposed to small) doors back to the tinkers. <br> <br> <br> You say, 'essence of sonnet' <br> <br> Kanaad says 'This will be the biggest hurdle between you and the potion. The essence of sonnet is a rare and wonderful thing, only the most gifted bards will ever produce one in their lifetime. No amount of effort or studying will help them either- it is an unexpected thing. You see, bards dedicate their life to the telling and retelling of stories, it is their job to inspire others with tales of triumph and tragedy. When a bard of the highest order sees or hears something that so genuinely and so overwhelmingly inspires them, something magical happens <br> <br> You say, 'essence of sonnet?' <br> <br> Elder Hymnist Hortitosh stops what he is doing and looks at you, most surprised, 'An essence of sonnet? I have never produced such a thing my friend, though the fact that you would even request one from me is very flattering.' His eyes leave your face and settle off in the distance somewhere as he continues, 'I was present once when one was created... it was beautiful. I was only a child, but there was no mistaking the significance. Oh how I would love to produce such a thing myself- an accomplishment without peer for one of my art. They say that the inspiration must be genuine, should you know of something that could inspire me so then by all means, I will see if I have an essence of sonnet within me.' <br> <br> **Give Hortitish the diary from Jalil's daughter and he will give you the essence of sonnet. <br> <br> Found Hoober just to the left of the Grimling Forest zone in Tenebrous. He doesn't roam from his spawn point so don't go running around the entire zone searching for him if he doesn't show up on track right away like I did. That would be a waist of time. I hailed Hoober and asked him where Behari was and got a lot of gibberish about the oppression of tube trees and a giant rat ruling the world so I gave him the potion and he promptly killed me for it. Luckily I had expected as much from a mad man and had my 55 monk standing by. I avenged my cat's death and tried to loot the corpse only to realize that I hadn't killed Hoober just sedated him. I kept an eye on Hoober while I ran back and looted my corpse with my cat. I still had the love potion so I decided to try to give it again to the now incapacitated Hoober. He stood up and began to act like a sane man. I asked him about Behari again and this time got a real answer. Sadly though the answer was that Hoober had killed Behari in his maddnes. He handed me a locket &quot;aisha's locket&quot; which He had taken from Behari. Hoober began to babble again about a giant froglok and despawned. I returned to Shar vahl and decided it would be best to share my knowledge with Jalil first rather than his already heart broken daughter. He told me that Aisha had been his wife and that the locket had been given by her to their daughter Kalila and then by her of course to Behari. He was sad to realize that Behari was in fact dead but thanked me for my effort and gave me this crappy belt: <br> <br> Belt of the Khala Dun <br> AC 6 str 3 wis 4 PR 2 DR 2 wt. 3.0 <br> War Clr Pal Rng Dru Brd Rog Shm Bst <br> Hum Eru Bar Elf Hie Hef Dwf Hfl Gno Vah</font></span><p align=left>
