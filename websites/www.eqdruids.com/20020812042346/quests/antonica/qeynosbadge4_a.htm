You must do the other three first.<br> <br> You say, 'Hail, Vegalys Keldrane'<br> <br> Vegalys Keldrane says 'Greetings to you, citizen. By order of the Council of Qeynos I have been given the duty of apprehending the individuals [responsible] for unleashing this terrible plague upon the people and the lands of Antonius Bayle. The more I look into this matter, the more I come to find that this will be no easy task.<br> <br> You say, 'i wish to advance further'<br> <br> Vegalys Keldrane says 'Interested in helping us further? We continue to gather valuable information. We still require [interrogators] that are able to pry the information we require out those less then willing to talk. Also, Velarte Selire at the Temple of Life is looking for help with his [research] so you may wish to talk with him. Lastly, we now have information we believe may lead us to the [individual that unleashed this plague] in the first place.<br> <br> You say, 'what individual that unleashed this plague'<br> <br> Vegalys Keldrane says 'The plague was unleashed by a woman named Azibelle Spavin. She was the bodyguard and some say concubine of Mordavin Telase. He was put to death for his long list of crimes against Qeynos which included murder, treason and attempted genocide. The plague is apparently her revenge. I sent one of my investigators and one of the best guardsmen we have to try and find her and bring her to justice. They are [still missing].<br> <br> You say, 'still missing'<br> <br> Vegalys Keldrane says 'Kane recommended Guard Helminth personally as one of his best. They must have run into serious trouble. These were two of Qeynos' finest. I am only willing to send those with both strength and intelligence down there to complete this mission and find our people's whereabouts. Give me your Researcher's Badge should you wish to accept this mission.<br> <br> Hand in your Research's Badge at this point.<br> <br> Vegalys Keldrane says 'Here is my personal seal. Go to the sewers and locate my investigator and show him this seal if he yet lives. Find out what happened to he and guard Helminth. Then if at all possible, complete this operation by finding Azibelle Spavin and execute her. Bring me her head and return me my seal and you shall be rewarded.<br> <br> Zone into Qeynos Aquaducts.<br> <br> The investigator was at 951, 30 laying upon the ground.<br> <br> You say, 'Hail, an investigator'<br> <br> an investigator coughs and struggles to move. 'There were. . . too many . . . too strong.'<br> <br> Give the investigator the seal from Vegalys.<br> <br> an investigator says 'Vegalys sent you. I'm done for. Guard Helminth found a false wall. We stepped through it. We were ambushed. I didn't see where Helminth went. He disappeared. I knew we were overwhelmed. I ran and feigned death but I knew [it was too late].<br> <br> You say, 'it was too late'<br> <br> investigator gasps clutching a wound and says, 'Their magic was too powerful. Necromancers. Undead. Cursed knights of an unholy god. They left when they thought I was dead. But even now their curses sap the last of my life. I made it as far as I could. If Helminth lives, tell him [I am dead]. Please complete the mission. Bring this Azibelle to justice. Avenge me.'<br> <br> Guard Helminth then spawns at 376, -49. This is just before the 4 spectres outside of the necromancer guild.<br> <br> You say, 'Hail, Guard Helminth'<br> <br> Guard Helminth says 'Who are you and what are you doing here? This place is not safe. You are to leave here immediately! You do not belong here!<br> <br> You say, 'vegalys sent me'<br> <br> I forgot to try the message from the investigator for Guard Helminth (&quot;I am dead&quot;). So I am not sure what response I would have received with that.<br> <br> Guard Helminth says 'So Vegalys sent you to check on our progress then? I don't believe you. Prove it!<br> <br> Give Guard Helminth Vegalys seal. You get the seal back and he responds with:<br> <br> Guard Helminth says 'Well, well! Vegalys did send you after all. Are you [ready to complete the mission]? I am certain I know where Azibelle is hiding.<br> <br> You say, 'I am ready to complete the mission'<br> <br> At this point, Guard Helminth respawns as Corrupt Guard Helminth. Also directly behind him a necromancer spawned. Both agro. A few seconds later a rotting sentry spawned next to me. All 3 hit in the 70 - 80's range. Rotting sentry did harm touch me for 351 points of damage. These guys wern't too bad to take down with a 55th mage and 52nd druid. Corrupt Guard Helminth was blue at 52nd but the other two were green.<br> <br> Once Corrupt Guard Helminth was killed, Azibelle Spavin was found on track.<br> <br> Azibelle was found at 439, -264 which is just past the 4 spectres that are outside the necromancer guild. She did not respond to hails. Proceeded to attack her (did find that I could pull her past the spectres without the spectres agroing). She is a shadowknight and was blue to 55th and 52nd.<br> <br> Loot the &quot;Head of Azibelle Spavin&quot;.<br> <br> Return to Vegalys Keldrane and turn in the seal and head.<br> <br> Vegalys Keldrane says 'Good work Meistoff ! So Guard Helminth was corrupt? So crafty are these black hearted souls that they can fool even the righteous Kane Bayle himself! I'm sure he will be saddened to hear of this. I too am saddenned by the loss of one of my best investigators. At least we've served justice this day by sending Azibelle Spavin to her dark master. May she rot with her god.
