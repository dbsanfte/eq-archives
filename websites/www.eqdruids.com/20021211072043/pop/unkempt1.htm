  The Unkempt Warders Vol. I</strong><br>
  <br>
  This work details little of the unknown ancient legends and history of the 
  Unkempt Warders. All text is factual, though many parts of this history are 
  missing. The Writ of the Wild, the ancient tome from which I have gathered 
  much of this information, is lost to me and the world for now.<br>
  <br>
  I give this warning and note to all who read these words: do not use this 
  information as a catalyst to pursue the Unkempt Woods or the people who dwell 
  there. This work is done out of fervent respect for the Unkempt people and the 
  bestial folk who have called this region home since before the time of the 
  elves. Their story is great and one that should not go unheard. Do not disrupt 
  these unique people who have mastered the true harmony of existence within the 
  natural order of birth, destruction, chaos, and order.<br>
  <br>
  In any case, those who dare to trek within the unkempt's territory will find 
  themselves greeted with passionate virulence. Even if you believe yourself one 
  of the purest druids of the Mother of All's modern followers, the woods are 
  not a domain for you to dwell. Leave it be - for your sake and for the sake of 
  the last pure forest to grace the face of Norrath since the destruction of the 
  Elddar.<br>

  -*--Valley of the Dawn--*-<br>
  <br>
  Nestled in ancient mystery and untold secrecy within the topmost regions of 
  the Underfoot, beneath the Unkempt Wood, resides a mystic place known as the 
  Valley of the Dawn. This haven of wildling beast-folk was constructed in the 
  unknown past, concealed from the keepers of Norrath's history by the blessings 
  of chance.<br>
  <br>
  The Valley of the Dawn was constructed before the time of man, perhaps even 
  before the time of the elves. The bestial-folk known as the Tribes of the Dawn 
  and Moon took haven on the surface of Norrath, comfortable and nestled within 
  the confines of the dank, dark, and strangely beautiful redwood forest now 
  known as the Unkempt Wood. As the solar and lunar tribes established 
  themselves as fierce warriors and guardians of the natural world that they 
  revere as sacred above all else, the tribes built the Valley of the Dawn - a 
  complex and beautiful subterranean citadel dedicated to the laws of the wild 
  that beings protect.<br>
  <br>
  Within the first era of man, when great civilizations and cultures were still 
  in the far distance of time, a nomadic tribe of humans stumbled upon the 
  redwood forest. The Tribes of the Dawn and the Moon were curious, although 
  they did not interfere with the humans' initial presence. When the humans 
  showed themselves to be intelligent beings that wished for nothing other than 
  their own survival, the tribes approached.<br>
  <br>
  It was the Gihjna that the humans first encountered - the ursine behemoths 
  whom represent the side of life and creation in the cycle of nature and 
  comprised the solar Tribe of the Dawn. The gentle, although wary Gihjna 
  interacted with the human tribe over the course of a single year and in that 
  time, the Gihjna lent their knowledge and beliefs to the curious and eager 
  humans. The Lujien - wolf-like creatures that embody destruction, death, and 
  the inherent chaos of the wild and comprise the lunar Tribe of the Moon - 
  never did show themselves as this historic moment, despite their shared 
  curiosity with their ursine brethren.<br>
  <br>
  The nomads settled within the forest and adapted themselves to the ways of 
  nature and the wild as the Gihjna had taught them. They ere fledgling in their 
  beginnings as primordial warders of the wild, although their magical gifts 
  were few and almost vulgar, for all they had learned was from Gihjna, whose 
  spirits are more tightly bound to the natural world than any human or elf.</font></p>
