    <p align="left"><font face="Arial">October 9, 2003 3:00 am <br>
    <normal>------------------------------</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>(Add to the line about the hp/mana augmentations that drop in 
    adventures now being type 7):</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>** Zones and NPCs **</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Two new raid zones have been added to the Lost Dungeons on the 
    Legends server. These are Guk-themed raids, one for Elemental Plane and one 
    for Time Plane capable raiders.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- The revamped Plane of Mischief is now available on all Live 
    servers.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- There were some situations where the warders in Vex Thal could be 
    up, but the bosses needed to kill them would not be available. That 
    shouldn't happen anymore.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Shrunk the giant wolves that appeared in the lands.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- The Coirnav encounter has been changed. Be much more careful if 
    you have been relying on stuns to deal with this encounter.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Corrected an issue with the Filth Gorgers that was causing them to 
    remain around with they were supposed to despawn.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Soldiers of Madness in Grieg's End will no longer be so 
    unbelievably numerous.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Zoning into the Plane of Fire will no longer cause characters to 
    occasionally take 20k points of damage.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- The Froglok Hunter and Forager will no longer be killed by the 
    inhabitants of Trakanon's Teeth, so they should be easier to find.</normal>
    <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- When Mithaniel Marr is killed, his planar projection now spawns in 
    the middle of his room rather than at the point of death. This fixes a 
    problem that could cause the projection to appear out of reach.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- The Qeynos investigator is now taking &quot;follow me&quot; orders again.</normal>
    <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>** Adventures **</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Every character that successfully completes an adventure will now 
    get at least one point as a reward. This is also true for the &quot;consolation&quot; 
    rewards.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Completing Hard adventures will yield more points.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Several trap spells on interactive objects have had their severity 
    reduced.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Added some new type 7 and type 8 augmentations to various 
    adventure merchants.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- It will be clearer now which raids are &quot;hard&quot; and which are 
    &quot;normal&quot;. Hard raids are intended for Time capable guilds. They are very 
    hard.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- All raid recruiters now properly check to be sure that you have 
    completed two adventures in their respective themes before they will give 
    out the raid.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Fixed an issue in a Mistmoore's Catacomb raid that was preventing 
    players from accessing an interactive object they had earned for killing 
    Sfisithik.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Removed the ability to see through Shroud of Stealth from some of 
    the NPCs that appear in LDoN Raids.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- There was a misconception about the behavior of goblins in some 
    Rujarkian Hills adventures. Goblins that are fleeing because they are 
    unwilling to die or are seeking help will make it clear that they are doing 
    so. We also corrected an issue that could cause these goblins to &quot;ping pong&quot; 
    in some cases.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- All of the &quot;flavor&quot; NPCs in dungeons (usually those that are lying 
    down, nearly dead) will display full health to make it impossible to tell 
    what kind of NPC they are (friend or foe) simply by looking at their health 
    level.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Hostages will no longer be attacked by their captors.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- We thinned out the population in the Grand Library and a few other 
    Miragul's Menagerie themed zones to bring the challenge in line.</normal>
    <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Rats in Mistmoore's Catacombs are now animals, shadows are now 
    summoned.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>** Items and Objects **</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Corrected a bug that allowed players to buy multiple lore 
    augmentations if they were in a bag (which also caused issues when trying to 
    loot corpses with those items). If you had multiple lore items, the extra 
    items will be removed. A refund for the points spent on those items will be 
    made when they are deleted.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Broken Chunk of Coal, Cracked Ruby, and Charred Pebble are no 
    longer valid augmentations. If you had these augmentations bonded to an 
    item, you will find them on your cursor. You can take those items to Dible 
    Hedledrap in South Ro and he will restore your adventure points.</normal>
    <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Perfect Garnet of Constitution, Pristine Garnet of Constitution, 
    Perfect Sapphire of Insight, and Pristine Sapphire of Insight can be turned 
    in to Dible Heldedrap in South Ro. He will replace them with type 8 versions 
    of the same items.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Changed pre-LDoN items to have a single slot of type 7 instead of 
    1. Some LDoN items which had a slot type 1 were also changed to type 7.</normal>
    <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Fixed a bug with the Adventurer's Stone that would sometimes cause 
    it to not display its bonuses.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Interactive objects will now only appear on LDoN raids when the 
    main boss has been killed. This change was done to prevent an exploit, and 
    is a temporary change.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- We have improved the types of rewards that can be found in 
    interactive objects to improve the reward given for the risk taken by 
    opening them.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Fixed a bug that prevented augments with no deity restrictions 
    from combining with deity-restricted items.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Added a message that should make it clearer when a character is 
    unable to loot an interactive object because they are on an NPC's hate list.</normal>
    <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Hand-to-hand weapons are now part of the one-handed restriction on 
    augmentations. So augmentations that say they can be used with one-handed 
    items will also work with hand-to-hand items.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Geomancer's Crown of Reformation now fits in the head slot and the 
    effect is worn instead of right clicked.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Gravestone of Dire Melodies and the Limestone Shard of Battle 
    Cries will now properly modify instrument skills.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- All of Royal Attendant Armor will now show up as plate armor.</normal>
    <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Rogue pets focused with Summoner's Boon should no longer lose the 
    ability to backstab.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Shard of Shrunken Bone was changed from Shield of Pain III to 
    Shield of Pain II.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Changed many of the new Lost Dungeons &quot;shields&quot; to make them 
    useable as shields (they can be used to bash now).</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Removed augmentation slots from the following items: Primal Velium 
    Knight's Sword, Divine Hammer of Consternation, Breezeboot's Frigid Gnasher, 
    Primal Velium Fist Wraps, Primal Velium Battlehammer, Primal Velium Spear, 
    Primal Velium Claidhmore, Primal Velium Brawl Stick, Primal Velium War 
    Lance, Primal Velium Reinforced Bow, Primal Velium Battle Axe, Primal Velium 
    Warsword, Ancient Prismatic Bow, Ancient Prismatic Lance, Ancient Prismatic 
    Spear, Ancient Prismatic Claymore, Ancient Prismatic Brawl Stick, Ancient 
    Prismatic Battlehammer, Ancient Prismatic Warsword, Ancient Prismatic Axe, 
    Ancient Prismatic Fist Wraps, Ancient Prismatic Staff, Ancient Prismatic 
    Stiletto, and Ancient Prismatic Mace.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>

    slot type 4 instead of 1.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Changed Pristine Limestone of Hatred to Vengeance IV.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- The hp/mana augmentations that dropped in adventures as slot 1 
    items will no longer drop. They have been replaced with similar items that 
    fit into slot 7.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Made changes to various stats and effects on Plane of Time items.</normal>
    <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Changed the level required to use the right-click effect on Wild 
    Lord Armor to 45, to match all other Kunark armor.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Corrected a bug with mounts that would sometimes leave the horse 
    buff up without the actual mount. Also corrected a problem that could cause 
    a player to be unable to summon a mount.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Fixed the haste on Spiritbound Mystic's Torch</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Altered the damage and delay on the Delightful Orb of Forgotten 
    Magic to be more appropriate for where it drops</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>** For the New Player **</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Find Feature added. This will create a mystical indication of the 
    path to take to find certain people. This feature works in the Bazaar and in 
    newbie zones and cities. In the Bazaar you just click on the merchant you 
    seek in the Bazaar window and click the Find Trader button. For all other 
    uses, just hit CTRL+F to open the window, select someone on the list and 
    click the Find button. This will locate any Bazaar trader or any NPC with an 
    alternate name, such as (Spell Vendor). The exception is that it will not 
    locate NPCs in the Wayfarer's Camps.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- The auto-attack key now defaults to Q (not A).</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- New characters start with their weapons and armor equipped.</normal>
    <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- New characters start with their spells scribed and memorized.</normal>
    <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- When a caster reaches the level required for one of the first two 
    rings of new spells, they will get a message informing them that new spells 
    are available.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- New characters will begin with a stack of bandages. These bandages 
    cannot be sold or traded.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- When a character trains in a hotbutton-able skill that he did not 
    previously have skill in, a hotbutton for that skill is created on the 
    cursor.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- New characters will have a page of hotbuttons set for them based 
    on the skills given to them by their class and race.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>** Interface **</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Merchants now separate items with different charges in their list. 
    For example, 9 dose and 10 dose potions will show up as separate items on 
    the merchant's list. Items with the same amount of charges will be stacked. 
    NOTE: This will remove the ability to &quot;recharge&quot; items by selling them to a 
    vendor and buying them back.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- The Bazaar now supports selling different charged items. For 
    example, a 10 dose potion with 9 charges can be sold for 90 plat., while a 
    10 dose version of the same potion can be sold for 100 plat. NOTE: All 
    currently priced charged items will no longer have a price attached and will 
    need to be reset by the trader.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Pet buffs are now visible in the pet window. A small icon will 
    display for each buff on the pet (up to 30 - you may need to resize the pet 
    window). You can hover your mouse over the icon to see the spell name. Alt 
    left-click or right-click and hold for spell info box (which only contains 
    name and icon).</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Improved the functionality of the ESC key. Windows close in the 
    opposite order that they were opened.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- When World Containers (ovens, kilns, augmentation sealers and 
    similar items) are closed, No Drop items in those containers will be placed 
    in the character's inventory. If it will not fit there, it will appear on 
    their cursor.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- The &quot;Only show items I can use&quot; option in the Adventure Merchant 
    window will be saved when you log out.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Hotbuttons created using the Abilities and Combat skill lists are 
    no longer connected to the buttons in the Actions window. This means that 
    you can create a button on the Abilities or Combat section of the actions 
    window, drag that button to the hotbutton window, then change the button on 
    the Abilities or Combat section, and the hotbutton you made will not change. 
    This allows you to create hotbuttons for ALL of your character's skills, not 
    just the ones that can fit in the Actions window.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- You can now use the (`) key to &quot;Target nearest NPC&quot;, in addition 
    to F8.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Shared bank slots will no longer accept rentable containers with 
    no-rent items in them.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- A new system for the leaderboard has been implemented to track 
    adventures by their difficulty. You can sort by normal/hard/all difficulty. 
    Not only will this display the stats for the leaders, but you will also be 
    able to see your own successes and failures at the bottom, based on the 
    sorting you chose for the leaderboard. So, for example, if you filter the 
    leaderboard by Miragul's Wins and choose Hard, you will not only see the 
    leaders for Hard adventures in that theme, you will see your own statistics 
    for Hard Miragul's adventures. NOTE: Because this tracking is new, it will 
    only be able to differentiate hard and normal adventures from the time of 
    this update onward. Past adventures will be treated as if they were normal 
    difficulty.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- /autojoin is now saved per character, not for all characters.</normal>
    <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- The Open and Inspect buttons are no longer &quot;grayed-out&quot; when Lay 
    on Hands or Harm Touch are used.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Merchant inventories will refresh properly after a character 
    purchases the last of an item in inventory.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>** Spells **</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Casting Grow on an unshrunk shaman pet will no longer shrink the 
    pet.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Remove Minor Curse cures 2 curse counters instead of 3-4.</normal>
    <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Lich and Pact of Hate now use different colored skeleton models.</normal>
    <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Monster Summoning will summon the correct models, not just earth 
    elementals.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Frostreaver's Blessing will no longer block the bard song Wind of 
    Marr. We realize there are still some stacking issues with these spells, and 
    we hope to resolve them soon.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>** Tradeskills **</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- The Blessed Steel Arrowheads recipe will return the file.</normal>
    <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- NPC Merchants will now pay less for Steel Hunter Arrows, Steel 
    Arrowshafts, and Steel Fletch.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- The Muckskipper Chowder recipe no longer returns a pot on a 
    failure or success, since the recipe does not require a pot at all.</normal>
    <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- The recipe for the &quot;Lemming Fur Backpack&quot; now requires an 
    Embroidering Needle instead of a Sewing Needle.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>** Alternate Advancement **</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Jewelcraft Mastery works properly now.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Frenzied Burnout will no longer last indefinitely on a charmed 
    pet.</normal> <br>

    <p align="center"><u><b><font face="Arial">Important change to some augments 
    on Weds Patch 10/6/03</font></b></u></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial">From EQLive:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <h1><font size="3" face="Arial">Augmentation changes for Update - PLEASE 
      READ</font></h1>
      <p><font face="Arial">As of our update on October 8th, the Solid Coal of 
      Prowess, Blood Ruby of Understanding, and Ooze-Covered Pebble of 
      Perfection will no longer be valid augmentations.&nbsp; If you had these 
      augmentations bonded to an item, you will find them on your cursor.&nbsp; You 
      can take those items to Dible Hedledrap in South Ro and he will restore 
      your adventure points.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">IMPORTANT NOTE:&nbsp; You MUST have some open inventory 
      space to hold these items!&nbsp; Also, if you zone with those items on your 
      cursor, they will disappear.&nbsp; So when you log in before the update, make 
      sure you have some free space in your inventory.&nbsp; And when you log in 
      after the update, make certain to get those items off your cursor and into 
      your inventory.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">This change is happening due to an issue with some 
      of the new LDoN items.&nbsp; These three augmentations will be replaced with 
      three similar augmentations that fit into slot 7 or 8.&nbsp; Along with that, 
      pre-LDoN items that were given slot type 1 will now have slot type 7.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Essentially, this will mean no change for those with 
      these augmentations in their pre-LDoN items.&nbsp; It will, however, restrict 
      the use of multiples of these augmentations on LDoN items.&nbsp; We apologize 
      for the changes, but these items needed to be more restricted to help 
      maintain game balance.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Alan</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial">If you have one of the above augments 
    make sure you are ready for this change!</font></p>
