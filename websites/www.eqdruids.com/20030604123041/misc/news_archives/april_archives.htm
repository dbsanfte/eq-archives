Someone will write out a list of ideas that they think should be implemented. They’ll post those ideas to a message board, usually one that caters to members of a certain class. Usually these ideas will be discussed and refined. Eventually someone starts a new thread and asks people to post to the thread in order to ‘sign’ the petition. Then someone (or everyone) sends a copy to us.<p>This is a natural thing for a community to do. And often this is a very good way to generate conversation and can result in some good ideas.</p><p>However…</p><p>For us as a team there are several problems with ‘petitions’. Unfortunately these problems make it so that petitions often end up being harmful to the production of useful ideas and they hamper good communication between the players and the company. A good idea is a good idea. Having four hundred people send in a good idea doesn’t make that idea a better idea. Yes, we’ve missed a few good ideas in the past, but there are better methods for getting those ideas across. We think that the Dev Corner is one of those methods.</p><p>We’d much rather have one person send in a good idea than a thousand people send in a list of ideas. The single idea is easier to recognize, easier to discuss, easier to reply to. It’s going to be clearer and far less cluttered. A laundry list of ideas is very hard to respond to. A petition that has a dozen suggestions basically requires a reasoned argument in response to each of those suggestions, even if some of the suggestions are obviously bad. The problem here is two-fold. First, we have to spend the time replying to the whole petition rather than just the good ideas. So just about any reply to a petition is going to sound negative, and this makes it generally a bad idea to reply to them. It makes us look mean, when we’re really a bunch of teddy bears.</p><p>Also, by their very nature these petitions are extremely long. It’s not uncommon to see a petition with a few thousand words or more. A very time-consuming thing to read. I know, I’ve read every petition written about EverQuest over the last 16 months or so. Petitions end up being bloated because of their create-by-committee nature.</p><p>It’s also hard to believe that a petition accurately represents the desires of a community. It’s probably fair to say that for most of these petitions any given member of the community will agree with some part of it and not other parts. But because they can only agree or disagree with the entire petition they will often sign it as a nod in agreement to the parts that they like. By it’s very nature, a petition can’t represent the individuals of a community very well.</p><p>And then there’s the “well they did it, so should we” problem. The moment we reply to one petition it gives people the impression that they need to use petitions to get an idea across. The truth is that ideas get across much more readily by just about any other method. And despite the fact that we respond to far more individual ideas than to petitions, any response to a petition seems to strengthen the perception that an idea has to flood into our email boxes in order for us to see it.</p><p>So here’s the problem. The discussions that take place during the creation of a petition are great. Some very interesting ideas come from those discussions, and we really don’t want to discourage them. But I do want to discourage the use of petitions as a tool for sending us ideas (for the reasons given in wordy form above).</p><p>All this leads to one comment, and one question.</p><p>Comment: Please, if you have an idea about EverQuest that you think will make the game better, send it to us through the Dev Corner.</p><p>Question: How can the community foster the discussion that produces good ideas without also creating the petitions that seem to be the natural conclusion from those discussions?</p><p>Alan<br> &nbsp;</font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></center></font><p><font face=Arial>At the Seattle Fan Faire Absor (Alan) was very open to people sending in ANY idea or problem that they saw with Everquest, but asked that it be done through the developers forum.&nbsp; He stressed that he does read every suggestion that is sent in.</font></p><p><font face=Arial>&nbsp;- Spiritual</font></td></tr><tr><td><p align=center><b><font face=Arial><a name="Some Changes coming to EQDruids 4/29/02">Some Changes coming to EQDruids 4/29/02</a></font></b></td></tr><tr><td><font face=Arial>I'm currently working on some updates and changes to EQDruids that I thought I would let people know are on their way.</font><p><font face=Arial>First the item tables are all being put into a database format so that the data can be manipulated a lot easier, and frankly so it looks better!</font></p><p><font face=Arial>Second I am investigating a program that if it works well will be used here.&nbsp; It is a news program that would allow people other than myself to submit news items.&nbsp; I am hoping this one works.&nbsp; I would love to be able to give people more input into the news!</font></p><p><font face=Arial>Lastly the quest section.&nbsp; That will also be put into a database format allowing more flexibility.&nbsp; One of the most requested features will also be added, having it list suggested levels for the quests.</font></p><p><font face=Arial>I am hoping to have the above going in over the next two weeks or so.&nbsp; After those go in, and are working properly, I have a long list of other additions I want to make, so things will continue along!</font></p><p><font face=Arial>Please feel free to make any suggestions you might have.&nbsp; I do read every e-mail that is sent to me, and I do take suggestions into my planning (I can't always do them, but I do listen to them all!)</font></p><p><font face=Arial>Send your suggestions to <a href=mailto:spiritual@eqdruids.com?subject=Suggestions>spiritual@eqdruids.com</a></font></p><p><font face=Arial>Alright!&nbsp; Back to work I go, have a wonderful day all!</font></p><p><font face=Arial>&nbsp;- Spiritual</font></td></tr><tr><td><p align=center><b><font face=Arial><a name="New Fashion Website for EQ Characters opens!

Rich Waters wrote something concerning this, and I want to quote part of it here.</p><blockquote><p>This quote is being misrepresented as to it's meaning. I'll break the change listed in the patch message down more clearly for you:</p><p>Added a Recommended Level equal to <b>the current item use level</b> for several items.</p><p>All of the items being referred to as changed this patch <b>already required the player to be level 51+</b> to even equip them or use their effects.</p><p>Adding the Recommended level to these items did not change their utility in any way, as the Recommended Level placed on these items was identical to the level at which they could be equipped. The Recommended Level was added to the items referred to in that patch to show the pre-existing level requirement on the item itself.</p><p>A good example of an item changed for that patch in January is the &quot;Di'zok Escape Staff &quot;. This item has always had a level limitation of 56 on it. If you were lower than level 56, you were unable to equip the item, or click it to use its effect. In the January patch, I added a Recommended Level of 56 to the item so that someone could look at it and know that it could be used when they got to level 56.</p></blockquote><p>This had me confused as well (not that it’s hard to confuse me), so I can see how this could have been misunderstood. Basically, the items we gave a Recommended Level to with that patch were items that already had hard level restrictions. We added the Recommended Level to help make those restrictions more obvious. No functionality was changed for those items.</p><p>Now, on to the heart of the matter.</p><p>The Recommended Level of an item indicates at what level the item will be most effective. The greater the difference between the Recommended Level of an item and the level of the character using it, the less effective that character will be with the item. The effect can be very noticeable if the level difference is large.</p><p>This allows us a lot more freedom when dealing with items that would have received the No-Drop tag previously. There are, basically, two reasons to use the No-Drop tag on an item (though I’m sure there are plenty of other reasons). One would be instances where we want the item to be obtained by the character in person rather than by purchase from another character. These can be seen most often with quest items and things like planar gear. Those cases would probably still receive a No-Drop tag.</p><p>But cases where the item might be tagged No-Drop to prevent twinking the item, that item can now be given scalability by setting a recommended level. This would allow you to pass items down to characters and those items will grow as they grow. It also means that if you manage to play above your level and defeat some fearsome foe to gain a Sword of Dragon Slaying, your character can wield that weapon and it will grow as he levels.</p><p>Recommended Level allows our designers to be a lot more flexible with item creation, an excellent alternative to just making an item No-Drop or a hard level limit (like the Club of the Ice Ocean, where a character can’t equip the item unless he is of a certain level).</p><p>I also wanted to address the rumors about changes to certain items on Test.</p><p>No, we haven’t changed the Fungi Tunic on Test. However, it is possible that we will do so in the future. We have been following the discussion about this item across the fan sites and from emails sent in to us directly. The Tunic is a pretty good example of the kind of item that has a dramatic affect on the game when it is used by lower level characters. We understand that some people see that as a good thing, while others see it as a bad thing.</p><p>We haven’t made any decisions about applying the Recommended Level to items like the tunic. But I wanted to let you know that such a change is not impossible, for the tunic or other items with similar affect when twinked.</p><p>- Alan</font></td></tr><tr><td width=757 height=18><p align=center><b><font face=Arial><a name="Subscription Extensions now available 4/10/02">Subscription Extensions now available 4/10/02</a></font></b></td></tr><tr><td width=757 height=18><p class=boldheader>EXTENSIONS AVAILABLE</p><p><font face=verdana size=2>A reminder to all players of EverQuest, if you wish to purchase subscription extensions before the price increase on April 25 the system is now enabled to accept it:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The 12 and 24 month extensions are available.

Recently the Death Fist Clans numbers in the thicket have increased and the Orcs are cutting down trees and mining the rock of the nearby mountains. Reports have come in to Rivervale that the Orcs are shipping the lumber and ore to the commonlands and stockpiling it for an unknown purpose. Whatever the Deathfists agenda, their increased presence has made the thicket a more dangerous place beyond the protective wall.</p><p>Not far from the tunnel that leads from the Misty Thicket to Rivervale lie mysterious cursed ruins. All that remains of what once stood at these sites are fragments of walls that are presumed to have been constructed around the same time as the nearby ruined tower. An ancient magical scarecrow stands at the center of one of these ruins and warns passers by that the place is cursed. It is a popular belief among the halflings of Rivervale that the crumbled walls once surrounded beautiful and fruitful gardens that were cursed when their owner and caretaker offended the Gods. Whether or not this story is true, the scarecrows warning is true as the gardens are host to diseased vermin and the animated corpses of fallen halflings who were brought to the there and buried after their death by an unknown evil.</p><p>With the Goblin Clan Pickclaws now occupying a portion of Runnyeye Citadel the number of Goblins now residing in the Misty Thicket has grown. These somewhat exiled Runnyeye Goblins have been mining Crude Iron Ore from the nearby mountains and are most likely attempting to forge weapons and armor to use in a goblin revolt to reclaim all of Runnyeye Citadel from the Pickclaws. With enemies to all sides these semi-exiled goblins are being far less troublesome than they have the potential to be.</font></td></tr><tr><td width=757 height=18><p align=center><b><font face=Arial><a name="New interface and Bazaar Still incoming! 4/5/02">New interface and Bazaar Still incoming! 4/5/02</a></font></b></td></tr><tr><td width=757 height=18><div align=center>From EQLive Website</div><div align=center>&nbsp;</div><div align=center><font face=Arial><span class=header>State of the Game: The Fabled New Interface<br> </span><font size=-2>04/05/2002</font></font></div><p><font face=Arial>We'd like to take a moment and talk about two of the features that we wanted to include with The Shadows of Luclin. The new User Interface for EverQuest and the player merchant features for the Bazaar.</font></p><p><font face=Arial>It's been asked about in Feedback, in game, on the message boards, at <a href=http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/index.jsp>Fan Faires</a>, and it's only fair that we offer an update.<br> &nbsp;</font></p><p align=center><font face=Arial color=#000000 size=-1><span class=header>What happened?</span></font></p><p><font face=Arial>It's been said that no battle plan ever survives contact with the enemy. Over Luclin's development our biggest enemy was time and the battle was fought over many days, even more late nights, and the occasional bad analogy.</font></p><p><font face=Arial>Toward the end of Luclin's beta testing, we re-evaluated the list of features that we were planning on having finished. Unfortunately, the Interface wasn't in a state to where it could have realistically been one of them. It just needed too much work to be able to do half the cool things that we wanted it to.</font></p><p><font face=Arial>After the expansion was live and the frantic pace slowed down a little, we took a deeper look at what, exactly, it was that we had on our hands.</font></p><p><font face=Arial>To be brutally honest, we didn't much like what we saw.</font></p><p><font face=Arial>We decided that it would be best to start over and write a more powerful system, which would allow us to do more than we had originally planned. What we really didn't want to do was advertise a fantastic new feature, then deliver something that fell short of people's expectations. We'd rather take the time and do it right.</font></p><p><font face=Arial>We think it will be worth the wait. We're being a little cautious when talking about specific features for the interface at this point. While we'd love to release details of all the features it might contain, we don't want to leave anyone disappointed if a feature doesn't make it into the release. (We honestly do try to learn from our mistakes.)</font></p><p align=center><font face=Arial><br> <span class=header>When should we expect it?</span></font></p><p><font face=Arial>EverQuest's interface consists of over 5,000 interface elements spanning 140 screens, tools, and windows. Some may not know this, but GMs and Guides have their own administrative screens in the EverQuest game client. In addition, Designers, Artists, and Animators have some of their tools built right in as well. All of these need to be recreated in the new interface.</font></p><p><font face=Arial>Writing a new, solid system and integrating it with that many moving parts is a large and complicated job. It's compounded by the fact that while doing this, we need to make sure that we don't break either of the two existing interfaces. It's definitely an interesting balancing act.</font></p><p><font face=Arial>Suffice it to say we have a number of developers and at least one artist working on this and nothing else.</font></p><p><font face=Arial><br> One of the more common rumors is that we're holding it back to include it as a feature exclusive to Planes of Power -- That's not going to be the case.</font></p><p><font face=Arial>Once it's nearing completion and is good enough to use for the majority of gameplay, we hope to begin rolling it out to the test server. Barring any unforeseen complications, that stage will begin sometime in the next few months.</font></p><p><font face=Arial>When it's complete, the new interface will be released to all players as a standard part of the EverQuest game client.</font></p><p align=center><font face=Arial><br> <span class=header>What about the Bazaar?</span></font></p><p><font face=Arial>The story of the Bazaar follows closely with that of the new interface. As our production cycle neared its end, we realized that we would not have time to complete the features properly before the release of Shadows of Luclin.</font></p><p><font face=Arial>Because this is a complicated new trade system, rushing this project could create item and cash bugs (both duplication and loss). So, as with the interface, we decided that it was best to do it the right way.</font></p><p><font face=Arial>The Bazaar will include several new windows and other such things, so creating the complete Bazaar has to wait until the new interface system is ready. Completing the Bazaar first would mean developing a number of windows for the old interface and then repeating the work for the new one.</font></p><p><font face=Arial>We hope to have the Bazaar available on Test shortly after the new interface is live.</font></p><p><font face=Arial><br> We're definitely sorry to keep you waiting for this. We're hoping that by the time it's finished, you'll agree that it was worth the wait.</font></p><p><font face=Arial><br> - The EverQuest Team</font></td></tr><tr><td width=757 height=18><p align=center><font face=Arial><b><a name="Testers needed for Kane Bayle 4/4/02">Testers needed for Kane Bayle 4/4/02</a></b></font></td></tr><tr><td width=757 height=18><font face="Verdana, Arial" size=2><center><table cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 width=95% border=0><tr><td bgColor=#333333><table cellSpacing=1 cellPadding=4 width=100% border=0><tr bgColor=#d0c0a6><td><font face="Verdana, Arial" size=2>Hi all.<p>I have a favor to ask of you.</p><p>If you have some time during this week, and you have interest in playing on the new server, please log in and fire up a new character.
