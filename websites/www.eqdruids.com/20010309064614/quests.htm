<p>Please note I do not want to be a generic quest site and have only listed
proven druid (or very desirable for a druid) quests here.&nbsp; I feel that <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/">Allakhazam's
site</a> is the best for questors and should be used for general questing.</p>

<p>The EPIC Quest</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="http://www.student.smsu.edu/b/bdh113s/">great link</a> on
the epic</p>

it wielded</a> and the effect is right click based taking approximately 7
seconds to cast. If it lands it snares the targets movement up to 62%, whilst

</p>

<p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">Druid Epic Quest Walkthrough<br>
<br>
The Start<br>
<br>
- Find Telin Darkforest (located in BW near Skyfire zone. Head a few seconds to
the right when you enter BW from Skyfire and you get him into track)in Burning
Woods and ask &quot;what action&quot; and you will get<br>
a note. if not, then your faction is too low. Faction can be<br>
built up fast by doing the muffin-quest in Freeport<br>
<br>
- Now go to Faelin<br>
Bloodbriar in Greater Faydark. She roams the northern part near and west of
Crushbone entrance (spawnpoint is 1500, 500. Give her the note and you receivea
ring. She is a rare spawn and can have orcs as placeholders. After giving her
the note she depops.<br>
<br>
- Giz X'Tin Kithikor roams the area near the path from West Commons to Highpass
Hold. Give him the ring and you will get a dark metal coin. After you hand him
the ring a lvl 50 Darkelf Reaver spawns and attacks but you can run away with
SoW. Don't help another druid or ranger with the Corruptor in East Karanas if
you still have to do this part. Killing the Corrupter gives you bad Faction with
Giz so that he won't give you back the coin for Telin.<br>
<br>
- Go back to Telin Darkforest and give him the Coin. He will give it back to you
as worn metal coin. He tells you to find Athele.<br>
<br>
- Athele in East Karanas can be found near the river just north of the barbarian
fisher village. Give her the Coin and receive a worn amulet. Give this amulet<br>
to Sionae (spawns -2300, -930), then to Nuien (spawns -3650, -300) and finaly to
Teloa (spawns -3800, -2860). The last step is the trigger for the Dark Elf
Corruptor and two Darkelf Reavers (I think all about lvl 48 to 50) to spawn on
top of the hill east of the river(loc -1500, -1000). Don't start this part until
you are ready to kill the DE Corruptor because all the druids except Athele are
triggerd spawns. So don't start giving around the amulet and stop at the last
stage. You need luck to meet the full druid gathering after another druid or
ranger did that part successfully.<br>
<br>
- Find the Corruptor and kill him fast on the hill north of the river. He will
depop after 10 seconds if not attacked. The 2 Reavers will head to the 4 Druids
and kill them. You dont needto kill the Reavers. Just kill the corruptor and
loot the tome. The best way is to have one or two friends on the hill that can
start fearkiting him. If the Druids die, never mind....Athele spawns again in
about 1 hour. Give Athele the tome and get an earthstained Note. Bring<br>
this to &quot;she who walks the land in service blabla...&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
- Ella Foodcrafter in Misty Thicket is this wanted women<br>
that wanders the zone. Give her the earthstained note and she will tell you that
she needs a mixture. She will give you her mixing bowl. It is a Container so you
need a free slot in the Inventory. She also mentions some kind of ancient bowl
that she needs.<br>
<br>
The Hardened Mixture<br>
- You must forage 4 items that you have to combine in Ella's mixing bowl.<br>
<br>
- Frozen Tundra Root from Everfrost Peaks<br>
<br>
- Sweetened Mudroots from Misty Thicket<br>
<br>
- Speckled Mushrooms from Innothule Swamp<br>
<br>
- Heartfruit from Greater Faydark<br>
<br>
- This can take several hours. Combine those 4 items in the bowl and you get a
Hardened -Mixture.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Runed Bowl<br>
<br>
- Go to the Chess Island (the lvl 52 Egress spell will take<br>
you there when you have enterd the zone) in Timorous Deep and ask Alrik Farsight
&quot;how do you make an ancient bowl?&quot;. He gives you a crushed pot and
sends you to Felwithe to talk to Farios Elianos.<br>
<br>
- Talk to Farios Elianos in Felwithe south. He can be found in the Library that
is behind a door in the shop. If he dont respond to you then your faction with
Keepers of the Art is too low. You can build up faction fast with the
batwing-quest in Felwithe south. If Farios talks to you, give him the pot and
you receive a grocery list. He will give you the receipt for the bowl if you do
a job for him.<br>
<br>
- Bring this grocery list to Merchant Nora in Felwithe north and she gives you
in return a bag of Provisions.<br>
Bring it to Farios and he gives you the receipt for the ancient bowl.<br>
<br>
- Head back to Alrik Farsight in Timorous Deep . He will give you an ancient
pattern when you give him the receipt.<br>
<br>
- The pattern says that you have to combine it with a piece<br>
of echanted clay and platinum speckled powder in a pottery wheel. No skill in
pottery required.<br>
<br>
- Platinum speckled poweder can be obtained through another<br>
subquest. Forage a Rose of Firiona in Firiona Vie and give it to Merdan
Fleetwood in Surefall Glades. The old wooden painting that you receive has to be
brought to the human skeleton that roams the western part of Frontier Mountains.
Head back with the silver chained locket you got from the skeleton to Surefall
Galdes and give it to Niera Farbreeze. She hands you the platinum speckled
pouder.<br>
<br>
- Enchanted clay can be obtained through Kinlo Strongarm in Kaladim's Everhot
Forge. If you ask him &quot;what mud&quot; and &quot;do it for me&quot; he will
tell you that he would like to have a colored axe for his service. This is a
Jade Reaver that can be found in the City of Mist. Hand him the axe and you get
the enchanted clay. I am sure if you are kos to the dwarfs then you can do this
part invisible. Just go to the Everhot Forge and hand Kinlo a Jade Reaver to get
the clay.<br>
<br>
- Now combine the pattern, clay and powder in any pottery wheel to make the Rune
Crested Bowl. No skill is required.<br>
<br>
The Stones<br>
<br>
- Go Back to Misty Thicket and hand Ella Foodcrafter the hardened mixture and
the rune crested bowl. She will make for you a softly glowing stone from it.<br>
<br>
- Ella tells you to find one such as yourself. For the Druids this means to seek
out Foloal Stormforest in Firiona Vie.<br>
<br>
- Ask her &quot;are you one such as myself? &quot;, &quot;what answers?&quot;
and &quot;what about Venril Sathir?&quot;. She tells you to bring her the stone
you already have from Ella and the gem that can be found on Venril Sathir.<br>
<br>
- Kill Venril Sathir in Karnor's Castle and loot the gem he<br>
drops. Venril is a very tough lvl 55 Necromancer that can only be beaten by very
strong guilds.<br>
<br>
- Give the gem and the softly glowing stone to Foloal Stromforest and get a warm
pulsating stone. Now this is the time where the quest splits up into the Druid
and the Rangerpart. Foloal tells you to take the stone and walk your path.<br>
<br>
- The Druid's path leads back to Ella in Misty Thicket.<br>
Give her the stone and you will get the Elaborate Scimitar (10/30 9wis 10mana
5sv poison and disease, looks like the Runed Falchion)....now you have one of
the four final pieces. She asks you to collect the Cleansed Spirits of Antonica,
Faydwer and Kunark and hand them along with<br>
the scimitar to Xanuusus.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Cleansed Spirits<br>
<br>
<br>
The Cleansed Spirit of Antonica<br>
<br>
- The withered treant in North Karana tells you to find the corruption in the
land. He means the Corrupted Mammoth (below lvl 30) in Everfrost Peaks (pops
near Permafrost, Mammoth Calfs are PH), the Corrupted Aquagoblin Shaman (mid lvl
30) in Lake Rathe (PH are the sidespawns on top of the underwater-tower. Middle
spawn is for Cleric Epic. Use wolfform to be non-aggro to the other goblins.
They heal each other so kite him away. It can take several tainted to get the
corrupted) and the Corrupted Hill Giant (mid lvl 30) in Rathe Mountains (HG area
south of the hill with the Guard Tower).<br>
<br>
- Give the 3 items looted from them to the treant to receive<br>
the treant heart. Go to Yeka Ias in South Karanas and give him the heart. You
find him east of the bridge at the water. He will give you the Cleansed Spirit
of Antonica.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Cleansed Spirit of Faydwer<br>
<br>
- You will meet a pained unicorn in lesser Faydark. Collect for him the items
looted from the Corrupted Seahorse in Kedge Keep (lvl 52, 1 or 2 groups needed.
As far as I can remeber you have to pass the area where Estrella is and the
named Seahorse Undertow), the Corrupted Cyclops (3-4 ppl, best tactic is
fearkiting because he is lvl 52. PH are the Seafury Cyclops) in Ocean of Tears
and from the Corrupted Brownie (Brownie Scouts are PH. They are green to 56/57
and give exp. Each can pop the tainted so it is possible that 2 or even 3
tainted roam the area. They are druids and the corrupted is a lvl 52 druid so
you need help from 2 or 3 people. Fearkiting is the best tactic) in Lesser
Faydark.<br>
<br>
- The Unicorn will give you a gleaming horn for the 3 items.<br>
This has to be handed to the gnome Silox Azrix in Ak'anon to get the Cleansed
Spirit of Faydwer. He is near the mines on the left side of the green river.
There is another greeny gnome near him but you can do this part with super camou
on you if you are kos or otherwise disliked there becaus you need no faction for
Silox.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Cleansed Spirit of Kunark<br>
<br>
- Ulump Pujik, a named Froglok in Swamp of no Hope (north of the Froglok
Village) tells you to give his own essence along with the 3 corrupted things to
the gnome that hurts the land. Kill Ulump and loot his Essence. Ulump is a lvl
55 warrior that doubles for 250 and he has 32k hp. He can't be slowed or tashed.
You should have 2 groups with 4-6 melee and 2-4 nukers (all as high lvl as
possible) to kill him. Lure spells hit for full damage.<br>
<br>
- The 3 corrupted mobs of Kunark arethe Corrupted Gorilla (mid 40)in Emerald
Jungle (root/dot him and stay far away. He has sow-speed and pops in the
northern part of the plateau. Tottering Gorillas are PH of the tainted and only
non-undead tainted will pop the corrupted), the Corrupted Barracuda (high 40,loc
-900, -900) in Lake of ill Omen (only the blue tainted will pop the corrupted.
Pull it on the land and kite him becaus root breaks fast. Would be much easier
if you have a friend that helps you kill the corrupted) and the Dragon Faydawer
that lives in the sea in Timorous Deep (Guild needed to kill him). He spawns
near the Firepot Room in the southwest corner and will be killed after 2 hours
swimming in the ocean because his path leads him into the aggro range of the
iksar master (lvl 60 monk)at the chessboard island.<br>
<br>
- Hand the 4 items to the Gnome Nekexin Virulence in Overthere to get the
Cleansed Spirit of Kunark. He can be found near the evil outpost at the water.<br>
<br>
<br>
The End<br>
<br>
- Hand the 3 Cleansed Spirits and the scimitar to Xanuusus the treant in North
Karanas to receive the Nature Walker's Scimitar.<br>
<br>
All the parts that haven't mentioned how many poeple you need can be do solo.<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>

</font><b><font size="3">Kunark Druid Quests:</font></b></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Handy Shillelagh:<br>
</font>&nbsp;Shrub Marwood of Fironia Vie needs a stout adventurer to<br>
go to the wilds and find a few items.<br>
He needs some tump stumps, one Kromdul (found on FOREST GIANTS, usually<br>
arbor or verdant in Burning Wood, maybe also in Warsliks Woods but not<br>
confirmed), one Kromdek (found in Frontier Mts on Giant Tumps) type and a<br>
mantrap root (from erollisi mantraps in the Emerald jungle or Trakanon). Get<br>
me those items and he will give you a Dark Oak Shillelagh. You will also get<br>
the quest for the Charm Plant Scroll. (Mid 30s Quest)<br>
The 2 tump stumps look and are called the same, like a wood log. As they are<br>
Lore you can tell you have both, or you need to Identify them.<br>
<br>
The quest was changed to fix the Charm Plant problem (Kaesora Sipders used<br>
to drop Tump Stump and no Healer silk).<br>
</p>
<p><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">Charm Plant:</font> &nbsp;<br>
You get this quest after finishing the
handy shillelagh quest. Shrub Marwood requires a few items and will give you the
Druid's Charm Plant Scroll in return. Bring him the following: Sarnack Farsight
Crystal(Sarnaks Revealer in Lake of Ill Omen), Sarnak night dust, Strathebone Healer silk (found in Kasorea), and
powder of Tsu. (Mid 30s Quest)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;The phrase to ask him was 'What is Fertile Crop?'The&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&quot;Powder of Tsu&quot; is off froglok tsu shamans in Trakanon's Teeth.(lore/no
drop), and it's Actually called &quot;shaman powder&quot;<br>
<br>
The &quot;sarnak nightdust&quot; is actually called &quot;pouch of dust&quot;&nbsp;
from sarnak<br>
partisans in frontier mountains.&nbsp; A good place to look for them is at a
little ruins area&nbsp; around loc Negative 2200, positive 1500 (also lore/no<br>
drop)<br>
<br>
When I turned in the 4 components, I got a scroll called &quot;fertile
crop&quot;<br>
(no drop)...Upon scribing it, it turned into &quot;beguile plants&quot; and
remains<br>
that way in my spell book.<br>
<br>
Beguile Plants is level 29 and costs 170 mana with 6.0 seconds casting<br>
time.

<p>
Shakey's Stuffing</p>

<p>This quest was enhanced (NERFED) in the last patch resulting in Balckened
iron armor and rarely the old belt/shovel.</p>

<p><strong>USE THE FORGE RIGHT BY THE DRUID FARM AND YOU DON'T NEED SMITHING
SKILL.&nbsp; HOWEVER YOU CAN FAIL WITH NO SKILL OR MASTER SKILL&nbsp; - YOU ARE
WARNED!</strong></p>

<p><strong>ROROR has been fixed!</strong></p>

<p>UPDATE: after you talk to the priestess in the temple of life in Qeynos she
tells you to tell Nemsoe Jusgata &quot;brother Estle needs the blessed oil&quot;
if you tell him that he just stares at you. what you need to tell him is&quot;I
will deliver the flask&quot; than you get the flask of the oil of life.<br>
</p>

<p>First off... the quest details wont be given to you by Reebo if you aren't 4-14 levels.
This does not mean you cant do the quest. Simply follow my instructions and it will work
fine.<br>
<br>
Ok the quest starts at Rivervale in the Druid Farm. (Love that place)<br>
Go here and Hail Shakey the Scarecrow. Ask Reebo what is wrong with Shakey. He will tell
you Shakey needs stuffing and a head, but as I mentioned, you really don't need to chat
with Reebo anymore to proceed with the<br>
quest.<br>
<br>
Go to West Karana. There where the Scarecrows spawn you will find the Miller farm.
You must get the no drop hay from the ground. You need one hay to continue the quest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
After you have obtained the hay go speak with Priestess Jahnda in the Temple of Life in
Qeynos. Tell here, &quot;I need the blessed oil for Estle&quot;. She will direct you to
another priest who's name has slipped my mind. This priest gives the oil out. Ok so now
you have the hay and the Blessed oil.<br>
<br>
Make sure ya have 66gold and head to the Ferrott. Might want to use invis on this one
depending on your level. Look around the Cazic-Thule Temple entrance for an NPC Lizardman
named Roror. Hail him then tell him, &quot;bless my hay&quot;. Give him the 66gold and the
hay and he will return to you some cursed hay and some experience back.<br>
<br>
Now finally go back to Rivervale, in the Druid farm is a forge. Put the cursed hay and the
blessed oil into the forge and combine it. You should get some Writhing Hay. (It looks
like a pouch, ?!?) Ok give the writhing pouch...er hay to Shakey the Scarecrow and walla!
You either get a neato magic weapon or a real nice magic belt for halflings. Repeat the
quest as many times as you like to get both. Or more for a nice profit. The stats for each
are Below. (lows 20s+ quest)<br>
