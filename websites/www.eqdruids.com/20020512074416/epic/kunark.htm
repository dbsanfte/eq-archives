<p>1. Find <b> Ulump Pujik</b> in Swamp of No Hope.&nbsp; He can be located near the
froglok village.&nbsp; He is a level 55 warrior with almost 100% Magic
Resistance.&nbsp; Lull will still land but every other spell I have seen will
not.&nbsp; Two good groups can do this very easy.&nbsp; 2 Clerics and 10
tanks.&nbsp; He double attacks for 250DMG and has 30k Hitpoints so it will take
a bit to kill him.&nbsp; He has also been known to run at 30 % health.&nbsp; Kill him and loot this item:</p>

<p align="left">2. Find <b> Corrupted Gorilla </b> in Emerald Jungle.&nbsp; He can be
located near the Northwest corner of the zone and has tottering gorillas as
placeholders.&nbsp; Tainted Gorillas will spawn the corrupted gorilla but only
the live ones.&nbsp; You will know because the undead tainted gorillas look
nasty.&nbsp; The live one will bring you the corrupted.&nbsp; Kill him and loot
this:</p>

<p align="left">3. Find the <b> Corrupted Barracuda</b> in Lake of Ill Omen.&nbsp; He
has one Deepwater barracuda as a placeholder at Neg 900 Neg 900.&nbsp; I found
that the easiest way to do him is by fearkiting him.&nbsp; Many tainted will
spawn but only the Blue colored tainted will spawn the corrupted
barracuda.&nbsp; None of the fish can be pulled out of the water except the blue
tainted.&nbsp; If you pull one out then you have the tainted that will spawn the
corrupted.&nbsp; They are very easy to kill once pulled on land.&nbsp; Kill him
and loot this:</p>

<p align="left">4. The <b> Dragon Faydedar</b> in Timourous Deep.&nbsp; This will be the
longest camp for most of you.&nbsp; He spawns at the Firepot room which is under
the wizard spires in the southwest corner of the zone.&nbsp; There have been
many suggestions on how to kill this baddy and I will only mention the one I
used here.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Buff your druid with 5
dummy buffs.&nbsp; NO buffs like thorncoat or anything that does DMG to a mob if
it is attacked.&nbsp; This is because Faydedar is a 50+ Epic MOB and he summons
if you do damage to him.&nbsp; We would like to prevent the summoning so you
stay alive =).&nbsp; Examples, See invis, resist poison, resist cold, resist
disease, and one other.&nbsp; Then load up with these buffs:&nbsp; SKin like
Nature or better, Resist Magic, Resist Fire, Levitate, SOW.&nbsp; The reason for the dummy
buffs is because the dragon dispells you and you must recast these upon yourself
so he does not take down your good buffs which are also on you.&nbsp; Med him to
full and camp out on the wizard spire in Timourous Deep.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Start a level 1
character in freeport and get him a sow and a levitate.&nbsp; DMF would be good
sense you have to run a long ways.&nbsp; Run him to Oasis and take boat to
TD.&nbsp; Run him to the spires and sit him down there.&nbsp; Now you leave your
computer on for what might be the next 200 hours. LOL.&nbsp; That is the longest
known camp thus far.&nbsp; I recomend letting several of your friends know so
they can watch your &quot;Bait&quot; while you are away from your PC.&nbsp; I
carry a cell-phone so this part was not that bad as I did not have to be home
the whole time which would have been impossible.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - When bait is killed you
have 2 hours to login your buffed druid and start kiting this little guy.&nbsp;
Do not be surprised, he is a very little dragon.&nbsp; Keep recasting your buffs
as he dispells them.&nbsp; Kite him around and rally your forces.&nbsp; Once
everyone is in the zone you can pull him to the chessboard and let them take him
down.&nbsp; If you die do not worry as he will return to the spires first.&nbsp;
Then you have 2 hours once again before he wanders to the iksar master in the
zone that will kick his butt.&nbsp; Thats right.&nbsp; If his AGRO list is clear
then he will only live for 2 hours.&nbsp; After 2 hours have passed he will run
into the Iksar master and the Iksar MAster wins....go figure.</p>
<p align="left">Kill Faydedar and you will receive this:</p>

<p align="left">5. Find <b> Nekexin Virulence</b> in Overthere.&nbsp; He can be found
east of the evil outpost along the water.&nbsp; Hand him all 4 items and recieve
this:</p>
