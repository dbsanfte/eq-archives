        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Further Down the Line Those of us 
        behind the scenes here on the EverQuest team have plans for the future 
        of the game. Further Down the Line is where we will keep you informed 
        about what those plans are. Please understand that these are our 
        long-term plans and may require a fair amount of research or development 
        time. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">1) Partial Zone Revamps </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">These consist of improvements in the 
        experience gain, monster density and/or item rewards in some of the 
        older zones. The goal is to improve the playability and reward for 
        adventuring in these zones without completely remaking the contents of 
        the zone. We plan to do several of these, and we'll keep you updated as 
        we move through these. We recently finished Veeshan's Peak, the Temple 
        of Droga and the mines of Nurga. Currently we are working on a partial 
        revamps of The Deep, Charasis (Howling Stones), Dragon Necropolis, 
        Sirens Grotto, The Hole, The City of Mist, Cazic-Thule, and Velketor's 
        Labyrinth. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">2) Updated Character Creation 
        Descriptions </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">EverQuest has evolved and improved a 
        lot over the last four plus years. With four years of updates and 
        enhancements, sometimes your information gets outdated. One of the 
        things we will be doing soon is updating the character creation 
        information both in game and on the web site. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">3) Damage Over Time Spell Foci </font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">We are working on implementing focus 
        items for Damage over Time (DoT) spells. Focus items improve aspects of 
        certain spells when they are cast. Originally, DoT spells were included 
        in a group of other spells that some focus items affected. But the 
        nature of DoT spells is very different than other spells, and the affect 
        of these focus items on DoT spells was not what we wanted it to be. A 
        new class of focus items needs to be created to increase the effect of 
        DoT spells. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">4) Items in the Planes of Power
        </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">We will be looking at the quality of 
        Planes of Power item rewards and improving them where appropriate. Items 
        for many of the lower tier gods will be upgraded and more rare items and 
        NPCs will be added to the following zones as needed: </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Crypt of Decay <br>
        Plane of Torment <br>
        Halls of Honor <br>
        Plane of Tactics <br>
        Plane of Innovation <br>
        Bastion of Thunder </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">5) Class Balance </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">We're still planning to take a look 
        at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen 
        behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game. 
        Finding the proper solutions for this situation will take some time. 
        Some options being considered are:</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Improve melee damage-increasing 
        disciplines <br>
        Improve Planes of Power melee weapons </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Additionally, we're looking at the 
        concerns from players about their spells, and changing them where 
        appropriate. The goal here is to remove annoying issues with spells, not 
        necessarily to increase caster power overall. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">6) Shields and blocking </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">We're planning on reviewing the 
        possibility of giving an innate chance to block when using a shield. 
        We've been hoping to do this for a while, and it should be getting a 
        realistic review in the near future. We'd like to increase the value of 
        shields, and make it a worthwhile choice for players who might normally 
        dual-wield weapons or use a two-handed weapon. We plan on balancing this 
        against classes which use shields by default, and therefore wouldn't be 
        making any trade-offs to equip a shield. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">7) Tradeskills </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">We will be looking at the chance of 
        failure for tradeskill recipes. We are aware of the concerns of trades 
        folk in EverQuest, and it is on our schedule to review things such as 
        the fact that masters of trade skills can fail the easiest recipes. That 
        doesn't necessarily mean that we plan to change it, but we will most 
        certainly look it over - and probably will change it :) . </font></td>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Here is the latest from EQLive:</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Upcoming for June 11th, 2003 </font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">It's been a fun month for the 
        EverQuest team. With the recent completion of Veksar and the redesigns 
        of Veeshan's Peak and the Plane of Hate receiving such a nice reaction 
        from the folks that have visited those zones, it's a pleasure for us to 
        be able to work on Droga and Nurga in the same way. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Seeing so many new faces on the Test 
        server recently has been a great. There's no doubt that we need as many 
        eyes on the complicated changes we make to the game as we can get. We 
        wanted to thank those of you that have taken the time to help us out by 
        logging into the Test server recently; you've been of great assistance 
        to us. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">And as players of EverQuest, one of 
        the most enjoyable things about working on the game is the opportunity 
        to add game features that we've always wanted to see. Many of them are 
        listed below. We think you'll like them as much as we do. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">1) <strong>Droga and Nurga revamp 
        coming to Legends.</strong> The mines of Nurga have been inhabited by 
        crafty Goblins and stolid Burynai for many long years, digging and 
        slaving away under the earth. It's time to shake them up! The redesign 
        for these zones will be on the Legends server, Stormhammer, with our 
        next update. The mines of Nurga will be a fun zone for characters of 
        levels about 40 to 50. The Temple of Droga will accommodate characters 
        around 50th to 60th level. Both zones will have some new events and 
        quest, while retaining the distinct feel of zones. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">2) <strong>Veksar moving to all Live 
        servers.</strong> Since the rediscovery of the lands of Kunark, there 
        have been rumors springing from the ancient lore of the Iksar. Most of 
        those rumors remain unfounded, as gaining access to the lore of the 
        insular Iksar is no easy task. One of the most persistent legends is 
        about a city that lies buried under the Lake of Ill Omen. That city was 
        called Veksar, and it is up to you to discover the tale of its fate.
        </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">3) <strong>Group experience bonus 
        increasing dramatically.</strong> We've been testing this on the Test 
        server for a few weeks, and some final tuning may be needed before it is 
        released. The goal is to dramatically improve the experience gained by 
        groups. The old group experience bonus ranged from 2% to 20% for a 6 
        person group. The new bonus will range from 20% to 80%. In addition, the 
        6th person added to a group will not count when experience is divided. 
        This means that in a group of 5 the total experience is divided by 5 
        then distributed to each member. A group of 6 will also only have the 
        total experience divided by 5 before it is distributed to each member. 
        Due to this large increase in group experience, we will be reducing the 
        experience modifier given in Planes of Power zones. Those zones had a 
        dramatic experience bonus. These zone-specific experience changes are 
        more than offset by the increased group bonus. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">4) <strong>Experience range increase 
        for characters above 60th level.</strong> This is another change that we 
        are testing and anticipate moving to the Live servers. It will open up 
        many of the &quot;old world&quot; zones to players previously restricted to Planes 
        of Power zones for experience gain. The range of NPCs that will be 
        &quot;blue&quot; to a level 65 character has increased as far as level 50, with 
        the &quot;light blue&quot; range extending to level 45. The best experience gains, 
        however, are still going to be for fighting things around and above your 
        level. This will open up areas for high level characters in groups and 
        solo. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">5) <strong>Shared bank vault will be 
        added.</strong> There are times when a player wants to trade items from 
        one character to another. In the past making such a trade may have 
        included dropping items on the ground or asking a friend to hold them 
        for you. To make such trades more convenient, we are adding two shared 
        bank slots to the interface. Any character on the same account and 
        server can access these extra bank slots. No-Drop items can't be placed 
        in these bank slots, and only one of any specific Lore item can exist in 
        the shared bank at any time. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">6) <strong>Planes of Power access 
        changes will be implemented.</strong> Planes of Power has provided us 
        with valuable insight into the group and guild dynamics that are 
        involved in large scale games. The way that we had expected guilds to 
        advance through the story of Planes of Power has become a problem for 
        some guilds as some members have fallen behind and found it difficult to 
        catch up. Obviously this was not our intention. We want people to play 
        with their friends and guild mates. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">To correct this issue, we will be 
        allowing characters to enter the following Planes of Power zones by 
        meeting a simple level requirement: </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><u>Level 55 and over</u> <br>
        Plane of Storms <br>
        Plane of Torment <br>
        Plane of Valor <br>
        Crypt of Decay </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><u>Level 62 and over</u> <br>
        Bastion of Thunder <br>
        Halls of Honor </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Characters that don't meet the level 
        requirement may still enter these zones using the existing flags, and 
        raids may still bring additional unflagged or lower level characters 
        with them. All other planes with flag or story requirements for entry 
        will still require those flags, and those flags can still be obtained as 
        they always have. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">This will make the majority of Planes 
        of Power zones available to characters over the minimum level, and will 
        allow their guilds to travel and adventure together in the planes. We 
        understand that those that have already earned the entry flags for these 
        zones have put some effort into that accomplishment. We will be giving a 
        reward to those that have done so, though you'll have to wait to see 
        what that reward is. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">7) <strong>Enhanced Spell 
        Descriptions added.</strong> Spell casters spend hours studying their 
        trade. It takes great mental effort to understand and master the 
        complicated arcana needed to cast even the simplest of spells. We have 
        added new information to the spell descriptions displayed in game. An 
        additional line of text explains what the spell does in general and 
        includes information such as damage and duration when appropriate.
        </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">8) <strong>A new method for 
        memorizing spells.</strong> There was a day when casters only needed 32 
        pages in their spell books, with only 5 spells per page. These days 
        spell books have 50 pages and 8 spells per page. Frankly, that's a lot 
        of spells. We've come up with a new method for finding and memorizing 
        spells that will make things easier for the overburdened spell caster. 
        Right-clicking an empty spell gem will open a list of spell categories. 
        Pointing your mouse at a category will display a list of spells. 
        Selecting a spell from that list will make your character sit down, 
        memorize the spell and stand back up. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">We know that many people are happy 
        with the existing spellbook system. Rest assured that the spellbook 
        isn't going anywhere. This new memorization system is an optional 
        convenience for those who wish to try out a new method of managing their 
        spells. The spellbook remains the only way to scribe new spells. </font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">9) <strong>Spell Favorites.</strong> 
        Spell favorites are an easy way to memorize a full set of eight spells 
        without the tedious book searching. Right-clicking on the spellbook icon 
        in your spell window will open up the spell favorites menu. You will be 
        able to save your current spell lineup as a favorite, delete a favorite 
        or memorize all the spells in one of your already saved spell sets. As 
        with the new spell context menus mentioned above, this will not replace 
        the spellbook, it is meant to make memorizing large numbers of spells 
        more convenient. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">10) <strong>Damage Over Time spell 
        messages.</strong> Damage over Time (DoT) spells cause a certain amount 
        of damage to the target at intervals. Currently, the caster of the spell 
        is only told about the damage done the first time the spell does damage. 
        All the other intervals were a mystery. What certainly sounds like an 
        easy feature to add required a bit of work, but after the next update 
        DoT spells will report their damage to the caster each time damage is 
        done. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">If the new messages get to be too

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">11) <strong>Improvements to the game 
        for new players.</strong> New players can be overwhelmed by all of the 
        items they find in the game (heck, so do those of us who have been 
        playing for a few years). To help reduce that confusion, we are adding a 
        Tradeskill tag to items that are used as components in trade skill 
        recipes. To help guide new characters, Guildmasters will take a more 
        active role in helping out new recruits by directing them to some 
        starting points for quests. There will be even more quests in the newbie 
        zones, most of them revolving around the pests that seem to inhabit even 
        the grandest cities. In addition, NPC merchants as well as other notable 
        folks will have a title that will explain what their jobs are. For 
        example, a baking supply merchant can be recognized as such by the 
        description beneath his name. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Also, as a heads up to players that 
        have created their own user interfaces for EverQuest, these are the 
        interface files that we expect to change next week. </font></p>

        There are indeed a few quests actually handled by bankers. Because 
        bankers can no longer accept items, those quests can't be completed. We 
        hope to have those specific quests addressed soon. <br>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Someone mentioned that they had heard 
        that Norton Antivirus with auto protection was slowing down EQ.&nbsp; So 
        we decided to run some tests.&nbsp; Our results shocked even us.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">We clocked login time, and then zone 
        time for each instance.&nbsp; To clock the zone time, we stepped off the 
        same edge of Kelethin and waited to see how long it took for us to load 
        after death.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">With Autoprotect running.&nbsp; We 
        had a loading time of 223 seconds from clicking on the EQ icon to 
        actually being in the game.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">With Autoprotect turned off.&nbsp; We 
        had a loading time of 191 seconds from clicking on the EQ icon to 
        actually being in the game.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">This is almost a 17% difference in 
        speed!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Next we did our death test.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">With Autoprotect running.&nbsp; After 
        dying it took 30 seconds to zone.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">With Autoprotect turned off.&nbsp; 
        After dying it took 25 seconds to zone.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Again almost a 17% difference in 
        speed!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">To verify our results we tried 
        several other programs.&nbsp; Loading a very large Word document we saw 
        almost a 50% faster loading time with the Autoprotect turned off, than 
        on.&nbsp; In Photoshop we reduced a 45 meg image down to a 450k image.&nbsp; 
        The speed difference also showed there but not as dramatically.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The only conclusion we can draw from 
        these tests is that if the program you are running is loading from the 
        disk often, the program will run 15-17% faster with Autoprotect off.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Now before you run out and turn off 
        your autoprotection.&nbsp; I am not saying to do that!&nbsp; Norton's 
        autoprotection definitely has a purpose on your system.&nbsp; However, 
        if you are going to be raiding or having a hard time with lag while in 
        EQ this might be an option to help reduce problems (just turn 
        autoprotect back on when you are done playing!!)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">For those curious, these tests were 
        run on a Pentium 4 computer with 512 megs of ram running Windows XP 
        home.&nbsp; I did run other programs in the background to make this test 
        &quot;real life&quot; but those background programs were the exact same programs 
        through each test.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">I'm not saying that Norton Antivirus 
        is at fault here, it could very easily be a conflict between Antivirus 
        software and Windows itself (there have been other incidents of Windows 
        and Antivirus programs butting heads) but this is something to be aware 
        of.</font></p>
