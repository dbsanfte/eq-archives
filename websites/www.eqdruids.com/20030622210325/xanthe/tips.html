<i>Here are some general tips for trade skills, and also a few notes about how these pages are laid out.</i><br><br>

<b><font size=+1><u>Underlined Items</b></font></u><br><br>

In these guides there are tables of items that you can make, or things that you may need that are made via another trade skill. Some of the items in these tables are <u>underlined</u>. Any item that is <u>underlined</u> can be made by a trade skill (although sometimes they can also be bought). This is just to let you know if you are going to have to find someone to make a part for you, or if you will have to make something yourself using another trade skill.<p><br>

<b><font size=+1><u>Picking up 1 thing from a stack</b></font></u><br><br>

When using items that stack, it can be a pain in the wrist to have to click on the stack, move the little scroll bar, then click ok to pick up 1 item from the stack. To get around this, hold down the Ctrl key and left click on the stack. This will let you pick up just 1 item from the stack, and will save you a lot of time and hassle. Use it often.<p><br>


<b><font size=+1><u>Wisdom and Intelligence</b></font></u><br><br>

It is widely accepted that the higher you wisdom or intelligence, the quicker you will skill up. Pick one, either Wis or Int and max it out as much as you can when doing your trade skills (wis casters will obviously pick wis, and int casters will pick int). Enhancing buffs will also help.<p><br>For those who are not of the casting nature, help is at hand! Well a bit anyway. Some tradeskills have what is known as a Secondary Stat. Let's take Smithing as an Example. Strength is the secondary stat for Smithing. If your Strength is higher than your Wis or Int, then that will be used to determine how fast you skill up. Makes sense I guess, if you think about it, a Warrior might not be very smart, but he's pretty strong and might make a good smith. Similarly Dexterity is the secondary stat for Fletching. At this time, I am not aware of any other secondary stats for other skills. This info taken from some Fan Faire or other, where a kind interviewer cornered Yak the Tradeskill Guy and made him cough up something to keep people happy:)<p><br>

<b><font size=+1><u>I'm a failure!</b></font></u><br><br>

Well, hopefully not, but it has often been reckoned that there is around about a 5% chance of failure on any combine you may choose to do. Not nice at the higher end of things...<p><br>


<b><font size=+1><u>Shadowhaven and Unfriendly Merchants</u></font></b><br><br>

Shadowhaven is a great place for tradeskilling, but alas not everyone is well liked in some areas. Nobody is Kill on Sight (unless you've been killing people you shouldn't), but it can make buying that one ingredient a bit of a pain. Thankfully, there is a way around this, and it is explained <a href="neckquest.html">HERE!</a> on our handy quest walkthrough.<p><br>
