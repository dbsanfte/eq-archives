      <span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Verdana; font-weight:700">You
      must do the Investigator's Badge Quest before doing this one.<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'Hail, Vegalys Keldrane'<br>
      <br>
      Vegalys Keldrane says 'Greetings to you, citizen. By order of the Council
      of Qeynos I have been given the duty of apprehending the individuals
      [responsible] for unleashing this terrible plague upon the people and the
      lands of Antonius Bayle. The more I look into this matter, the more I come
      to find that this will be no easy task.<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'How can I advance further?'<br>
      <br>
      Vegalys Keldrane says 'Interested in advancing further are you? Excellent,
      we are ready to begin the next phase of our operation. We have gathered a
      great deal of information as a result of the latest series of arrests.
      What we require most now are [interrogators] that are able to pry the
      information we require out those less then willing to talk.<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'What interrogators?'<br>
      <br>
      Vegalys Keldrane says 'If you are interested in joining the ranks of our
      interrogators and helping Qeynos further as we bring these fiends and
      murderers to justice, turn in your investigator's Badge and I will give
      you the briefing document you need. I already know I can trust my
      investigator's, so there is no need to further test you.<br>
      <br>
      Vegalys Keldrane says 'Very well, here is the briefing document. Please
      read it very carefully. I wish you luck friend, this mission could prove
      to be dangerous.<br>
      <br>
      The document leads you to an interrogator.<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'Hail, an interrogator'<br>
      <br>
      an interrogator says 'I see you wish to become an interrogator. This is
      not a duty for the weak of heart you know. This job sometimes requires. ..
      an interrogator coughs, 'a little muscle I guess you would say.'<br>
      <br>
      an interrogator says 'Nevertheless, we have an important job to do. There
      is a man by the name of Theodore Exanthem who is a known member of the
      Bloodsaber cult. He fled from Qeynos some time ago and we have been hot on
      his tail ever since.<br>
      <br>
      an interrogator says 'We have tracked this man down and we now know his
      whereabouts. However, we have bigger fish to fry today then just this low
      life. Theodore knows the location of two other individuals also suspected
      of hiding out here in the plains.<br>
      <br>
      an interrogator says 'Sadly, these fiends were the two that slipped into
      Surefall Glade and poisoned the waters there. Though the druids were able
      to quickly combine their efforts and neutralize the toxins with their
      magicks, grievous damage was done none the less. Two of the great
      protectors of the hills and the glade, Holly Windstalker and Cros Treewind,
      became seriously ill as did one of the glade's sacred bears.<br>
      <br>
      an interrogator says 'Holly and Cros, sickened as they were, removed
      themselves from the Hills to weather out their illness and to keep the
      disease from spreading further. During their absence, the Bloodsabers were
      easily able to traffic in the materials needed to complete their terrible
      work.<br>
      <br>
      an interrogator shakes his head sadly and says, 'Tragically, Cros Treewind
      was attacked by one of the sacred bears which was maddened by its illness.
      In his weakened state Cros was unable to defend himself and was killed by
      this defiled grizzly, one of the very creatures he was sworn to protect.'<br>
      <br>
      an interrogator says 'So our goal is to pry the information we need from
      Theodore Exanthem so that we may bring these two fugitives to justice.
      After getting him to comply, you are to collect a confession from Theodore
      and have him lead us to the two fugitives. Give me Theodore's confession
      and the heads of these two fugitives and you shall have your badge.<br>
      <br>
      an interrogator says 'I believe I know where we can find him. Follow me
      please.<br>
      <br>
      Follow the interrogator.<br>
      <br>
      an interrogator says 'Theodore Exanthem by order of the Council of Qeynos
      and his lordship Antonius Bayle, I order you to come out of there
      immediately!<br>
      <br>
      an interrogator says 'Theodore Exanthem, you will [take us to the
      location] of Marcus Cachexia and Morley Murrain immediately.<br>
      <br>
      Theodore Exanthem says 'I think you've been breathing the air in the
      Northern Plains of Karana for too long. I will most certainly not tell you
      anything about their whereabouts, much less lead you right to them. You
      are not right in the head.<br>
      <br>
      an interrogator says 'Vile beast! You are withholding information on two
      men guilty of terrible atrocities, not the least of which was causing the
      death of one of Qeynos' most respected and well known citizens, Cros
      Treewind! As an Interrogator I am authorized to use physical force if
      necessary.<br>
      <br>
      Theodore Exanthem says 'What a joke! I'm not telling you a thing. You
      don't look like you could scare a moss snake. I'm not afraid of you!<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'Take us to the location'<br>
      <br>
      Theodore Exanthem reels back, his eyes wide with shock. Ow, he says
      nervously.<br>
      <br>
      an interrogator says '[Take us to the location] of Markus Cachexia and
      Morley Murrain!<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'Take us to the location'<br>
      <br>
      Theodore Exanthem winces and says, Oh. Yeah right. Like I'm afraid of that
      moron or something. Theodore glances nervously over at you.<br>
      <br>
      an interrogator says 'Take us to Markus Chachexia and Morley Murrain this
      instant or I'll turn you over to my friend here who appears to be much
      stronger then I am!<br>
      <br>
      an interrogator smiles and says, 'Well, I'm getting tired. Why don't you
      hit him for a while. Maybe you will be more convincing then I have been.'<br>
      <br>
      Attack him without a weapon.<br>
      <br>
      Theodore Exanthem says 'Sweet father of rot, alright already! Stop hitting
      me and tell me what you want me to do!<br>
      <br>
      Give him the unsigned confession document you got from the inspector.<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'Take us to the location'<br>
      <br>
      Theodore Exanthem says 'Fine follow me creeps.<br>
      <br>
      At this point you follow the interrogator to the south to the abandoned
      druid ring. The culprits spawn along with some minnions and wraiths. They
      are Morley Murrain and Markus Chachexia. Bring back their heads along with
      the signed confession.<br>
      <br>
      an interrogator says 'Excellent work, you did just fine today. You'll make
      a fine interrogator. Talk to Vegalys about advancing further.<br>
      <br>
      You receive your interrogators badge<o:p>
