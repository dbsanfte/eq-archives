        working hard to ensure development is on schedule and things are looking 
        really fantastic.&nbsp; Initially, we wanted to avoid mentioning too much too 
        soon; unfortunately the lack of details has lead, at least in part, to 
        an increase in rumors as we get closer to the release of Planes of 
        Power.&nbsp; We'd like to put some of those rumors to rest and give you a 
        general outline of some of the things we have planned.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">For Planes of Power there will be two forms of 
        character advancement: level increase and Planar Advancement.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The level cap will increase to 65.&nbsp; Those levels 
        will have inherent benefits much like previous levels.&nbsp; However, they 
        will not be exactly the same.&nbsp; The rate of advancement in character 
        levels is designed to feel more natural and not take the punishing time 
        commitment required between 51 and 60.&nbsp; We understand the frustration 
        that painfully long levels can cause, and hope not to repeat that 
        experience for players.&nbsp; This, combined with the new bonuses for 
        fighting higher level opponents, should make leveling seem less like 
        something that you have to do and more like something that just happens 
        as you play.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Level advancement is closely tied to Planar 
        Advancement.&nbsp; The systems compliment each other.&nbsp; Planar advancement 
        includes extensions on the Alternate Advancement system, along with new 
        abilities for all classes.&nbsp; Advancing your character is a combination of 
        traditional leveling and advancement through planar abilities.&nbsp; Players 
        who enjoy pure leveling can do so, and people that prefer a combination 
        of level advancement and investment in specific abilities can do that as 
        well.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">That's the basic plan for advancement in Planes of 
        Power.&nbsp; We'll continue to refine and tune the specific details as we go 
        through the remaining six weeks of beta testing.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Many of the game balancing and system changes 
        you've seen in Live EverQuest over the last few months have been done 
        with this future advancement in mind.&nbsp; Expect to see more balancing that 
        allows us to once again develop high end content that does not involve 
        marathon battles that are more about attendance and endurance than 
        tactics and skill (e.g. The first time people rounded the corner, stared 
        Trakanon square in the face, and knew they had mere minutes to win or 
        lose, as opposed to the second hour of an end-game encounter.)&nbsp; Creating 
        Planes of Power has been as much about reevaluating existing gameplay as 
        it has been about creating new gameplay.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">We believe that advancement should be fun and 
        rewarding.&nbsp; We are very aware of the issues that players are not 
        enjoying in current gameplay and some of the mechanics introduced with 
        other expansions.&nbsp; We plan to avoid contrived &quot;timesinks&quot;, so that 
        you'll be playing rather than just spending time.&nbsp; This is not to say 
        that success in Planes of Power doesn't require some time, we just want 
        it to be time that you can enjoy.&nbsp; And even though this is a high level 
        expansion, there will be ways for both casual and hardcore players to 
        advance.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">That is as much detail as we can give you right 
        now.&nbsp; We appreciate your patience, and we hope that you'll enjoy Planes 
        of Power.</font></p>

        <font face="Arial">Todays patch had a TON of changes that will affect 
        druids.&nbsp; I'll list the ones that I've seen in the patch message:</font><ul>
          <li>** Keyrings ** <br>
          <br>
          We will be resetting all keyrings with this patch. This will mean that 
          all existing keys in the keyrings will be removed. You will need to 
          place keys back onto the keyrings. Keys are added to the keyring by 
          using the key. The keyring is a part of the character, not a space in 
          inventory. To find out what keys you have just type /key and the game 
          will give you a list. If you have recently deleted a key, please 
          contact your GM for a replacement. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>** Experience Changes ** <br>
          <br>
          - We have smoothed out level progression from 50-60. This should 
          mitigate the &quot;penalty effect&quot; that occurs in levels 51, 54 and 59. 
          Note that it will cost the same experience to level from 50 to 60 as 
          it did before. Also, death experience loss will appear different in 
          some levels. This is an unfortunate side effect that must remain to 
          prevent some experience exploits. <br>
          - We have rebalanced the rewards for killing NPCs for characters over 
          level 50. NPCs that are considerably weaker than you will give you 
          less experience. NPCs give more experience the higher level they are, 
          and for the best results you should fight the most challenging 
          monsters you can reasonably manage. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>** Spells ** <br>
          <br>
          - Fixed the &quot;You have been healed for X damage&quot; message. It once again 
          reports the actual amount of damage healed.</li>
          <li>- Added a message telling the caster when NPC can't be charmed.</li>
          <li>- Fixed a bug that was allowing focused and Alternate Advancement 
          ability enhanced damage spells to do more damage than they should 
          (meaning that both the Alternate Advancement and the Focus improve the 
          base damage. The focus damage was never supposed to compound with the 
          added AA damage.) <br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>- Higher level PCs will be more resistant to lower level NPCs' 
          spells. <br>
          - Increased the number of spells that can be in effect on a given NPC 
          to 30.</li>
          <li>** Spell Stacking Changes ** <br>
          We've made two changes to the way spells stack. <br>
          <br>
          Damage Over Time (DoT) spells are spells that linger on the target 
          doing damage. Until today two different characters could not have the 
          same DoT spell on the same target. As long as one copy of the spell 
          was active any new version of the spell would not take hold. After 
          today the same DoT spell cast by different casters can affect the same 
          target at the same time. Also, if you cast a DoT spell on a target and 
          you already have that spell active on it, the spell will refresh. 
          (Note: It will not be possible to stack Lifeburn). <br>
          <br>
          This does not allow for inferior spells to stack along with superior 
          spells. (Example: Two Necromancers can both land Boil Blood on the 
          same target. However, Heat Blood, being an inferior spell, will still 
          not stack.) <br>
          <br>
          Several DoT spells that have debuff components such as Tuyen's Chant 
          of Frost and Breath of Ro will not stack due to the balance issues of 
          having several hundred points of Resistance debuffs on a single NPC.
          <br>
          <br>
          We've also rewritten the way that spells stack with other spells with 
          the same benefits (for example, to spells that give bonus hit points). 
          Generally speaking spells may now 'bounce' off each other (neither 
          overwriting the other) and stacking issues should now be easier to 
          resolve. In specific: <br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>- Druid Damage Shields should now all stack in the correct order.
          <br>
          - Druid HP buffs are no longer overwriting stronger cleric HP buffs.
          <br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>** Resistance Changes ** <br>
          <br>
          We've made some fairly drastic changes to the way the spell resistance 
          system works. Previously, there was only the smallest benefit to 
          having resists over a certain value. We've reworked resistance in its 
          entirety, completely replacing the old system with one that is more 
          logical. <br>
          <br>
          The idea behind the changes is pretty simple: Resists should matter in 
          a way that makes sense. <br>
          <br>
          Important things to note about the new resistance system: <br>
          <br>
          - Resists matter more for PCs. There are now tangible differences 
          between having 50, 150, and 250 in a given resistance, for example. 
          Resistance buffs, bard songs, and resist gear have actual value, all 
          the way up the line. <br>
          <br>
          - Conversely, resistances also matter more for NPCs. Some NPCs became 
          more vulnerable to things they have always been vulnerable to, other 
          NPCs became more resistant to things that they were inclined to be 
          somewhat resistant to. <br>
          <br>
          - Resistance debuffs should also have more value, all the way up the 
          line. For the first time, resistance debuffs now have the ability to 
          bring NPCs that were lure-style only down into the range of being hit 
          by normal spells. <br>
          <br>
          - The hard level limit involving players casting on NPCs has been 
          removed. This used to be referred to in EQ folklore as the &quot;Six Level 
          Limit&quot; (It was actually 1.25 times the caster's level, but more people 
          likely thought about it the other way.) This means that in the vast 
          majority of cases, there is at least a small chance that a person will 
          be able to connect a spell with an NPC, even if they are out of that 
          NPC's traditional level range. <br>
          <br>
          - Overall, against NPCs that have medium-to-high resistances of a 
          given type, expect to see more full hits, fewer partials, but more 
          full resists in the new system. Taken over time, the damage done by PC 
          casters to semi-high resistance NPCs should be approximately the same, 
          but will definitely improve when the proper debuffs are applied (we 
          wanted to make sure that this did not turn into a universal nerf of 
          casters). <br>
          <br>
          We look forward to seeing how these changes play out in front of a 
          larger audience. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>** Line of Sight Changes ** <br>
          <br>
          - For spells that require Line of Sight (LoS), the LoS check is now at 
          the beginning of the spellcast, not the end. <br>
          - Spells that require but do not have of LoS will now fail 
          immediately. <br>
          - Harmful spells require LoS. <br>
          - Most Beneficial spells still do not require LoS. <br>
          - Bind Sight type spells do not require LoS. <br>
          - Any beneficial spell containing a Cancel Magic component requires 
          LoS. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>** Pets ** <br>
          - Pet-only buffs now automatically attempt to target your pet if you 
          cast them with the wrong target or no target at all. <br>
          - The limit on the amount of haste that can be applied to a pet has 
          been changed (aka. The Pet Haste Cap). The amount of haste that can be 
          placed on a pet now scales with the level of its owner. The scaling 
          occurs in a way that is consistent with how much haste a given caster 
          can place on his own pet (using a Level 56 Magician as an example: The 
          idea is that both Burnout IV and Muzzle of Mardu should be useful).
          <br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>** User Interface ** <br>
          <br>
          - Deleting Spells from Spellbook: Storebought spells can be deleted 
          from your spellbook. To delete a spell just right-click it to 
          highlight it and tap the DELETE key. Please note: This does not 
          convert the spell back into a scroll. You will have to buy a new 
          scroll if you wish to re-scribe the spell. No reimbursements will be 
          made for deleted spells. <br>
          - Item Links: When you inspect an item with Alt-Left-Click, the item 
          inspect window stays up. To paste a &quot;link&quot; to the item you're looking 
          at into your chat bar, click on the item's graphic. That will &quot;speak&quot; 
          a link that others can click on to see the stats of the item, as if 
          they were inspecting it themselves. <br>
          - Updated the /note window. The old /note &lt;text&gt; command still works 
          as it always has. But you can now use /note without additional text to 
          produce a text window for entering note text. The /note command window 
          should not break existing skins. <br>
          - Fixed a bug with the tracking window that was showing the sorting 
          set for something other than normal for non-rangers (this was just a 
          visual bug). <br>
          - Fixed a bug that sometimes caused a crash when zoning with the 
          corpse window open. <br>
          - Added UI Label type #74 = Player Title <br>
          - &quot;Reply to&quot; will properly prepend a ;tell in front of names that are 
          from other servers. <br>
          - Extended the &quot;reply to&quot; queue to 50 names. <br>
          - Fixed some aesthetics with labels. Percentages will never show above 
          100 now (even during a heal). Corpse HP will always show 0. <br>
          - There will now be sound when banking coins. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On top of all the above, I have had reports of the snare component of 
        our Epic Weapon has also been removed.</p>
        <p>No reports of the new healing spell yet, hopefully next patch.</p>
        <p>The above is just the parts of the patch message that seemed to speak 
        to druids :)&nbsp; For more, patch and you will see the entire message.</p>
