  <font face="Arial">You can only do this quest with a single group. Completing 
  this quest (or any of the other trials) will give you access to the Plane of 
  Storms and the Plane of Valor<br>
  <br>
  Talk to Mavuin in the basement cellblock. Hail him and follow the dialogue. He 
  will ask you to plead his case before the Tribunal, agreeing will grant you a 
  character flag. <br>
  <br>
  Head to the area with The Tribunal, and ask them about Mavuin. Following the 
  dialog, saying &quot;I am prepared&quot; to each Tribunal will give you description of 
  the six trials. <br>
  <br>
  To do this one, say &quot;I am ready to begin the trial of execution.&quot; Make sure 
  you are actually prepared when you say that because your group will be 
  teleported to the event area where you will only get a few seconds before 
  things start.<br>
  <br>
  This trial goes in four waves. When you start the trial, an executioner will 
  spawn at the far end of the room. Your job is to protect the prisoners from 
  being executed. Four waves of Mobs will spawn. Kill them as fast as you can 
  because the Executioner moves toward the prisoners as you attempt to kill the 
  mobs and if you are not fast enough he will kill the prisoner and your trial 
  will have failed. Each wave goes faster than the one before it, so try to 
  conserve mana on the early ones so that you can do some serious nuking by the 
  last one.<br>
  <br>
  After you have killed off the fourth wave, you need to then kill the 
  executioner. Killing him wins the trial and wins you the Mark of Execution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now talk to the Tribunal and say &quot;what evidence of Mauvuin&quot; and they will tell 
  you that they have consented to hear Mauvuin's case. Head back down and talk 
  to him and he will ask you to go see Karana and Mithaniel Marr. This will flag 
  you to be able to enter the Plane of Storms and and Plane Valor.<br>
  <br>
  This trial is popular, and may have a wait time associated with it, as it is 
  the easiest of the trials, and it can only be run once every 30 minutes per 
  server on success. On failure, it can be re-run as soon as all the players 
  from the failed trial clear out of the room.</font></b></p>
