        </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Heya.<br>
        <br>
        This is *my* guide on how to kill Faydedar. I have attended several 
        raids versus this Dragon (Including two for my own epic). I also have 
        borrowed information from Brewall's guide at www.crimsontalon.com and 
        http://www.pucksworld.com/fay.html <br>
        <br>
        I would suggest that someone create a alt - and stash them at the oasis. 
        This will allow a check of the trigger so a entire raid force is not 
        moved to the oasis to not have the trigger available to battle. The 
        trigger is a Dwarf Fisherman named Dolgin Codslayer, his respawn is 12 
        hours. YOU WILL NOT KILL HIM. In fact - just stay away from him 
        entirely.<br>
        <br>
        You will need between 18 and 30 people.<br>
        <br>
        What level do I have to be?:<br>
        <br>
        I would strongly recommend high 40s - 60. Faydedar has a Area of Effect 
        Fear spell known as Dragon's Roar. Granted a high magic resistance is 
        helpful for resisting this, nothing can beat being a higher level to 
        improve your chances of resisting the Fear attack and Lava Breath 
        Weapon. <br>
        <br>
        What do I have to bring?:<br>
        <br>
        Resist Gear. This Gear should make your Save versus magic A LEAST 50. I 
        would go as far as to suggest 75. You will have a *unbuffed* Fire 
        resistance of as near 100 as possible. Low resistances and you can plan 
        for a early death. If a Mage is handy - resist gear can be summoned for 
        you.<br>
        <br>
        Getting There:<br>
        <br>
        Getting there takes time - and normally lots of it. People should 
        effectively begin moving to the raid location 1 hour PRIOR to the start 
        time.<br>
        <br>
        Melee should bind in East Freeport. Casters should bind at the Oasis 
        docks (there is no Binding in the Timorous Deep).<br>
        <br>
        Once people are bound, and in Timorous Deep you will need to run to the 
        oasis.<br>
        <br>
        The Oasis is hidden behind to thick stone walls, the only way threw the 
        walls is by locating the underwater entrance in each. I recommend using 
        EB, or EB items.<br>
        <br>
        The location of the OUTER Ring is: Neg 11520, Neg 3776<br>
        <br>
        Once threw the cave, you will see another wall, the location of the 
        SECOND Cave is: Neg 11333, Neg 1352.<br>
        <br>
        Once threw the second cave - you will be on a beach with a large pier. 
        This is the correct location - wait for the rest of the raid to arrive. 
        Seriously. This is a long run without being CoH'd. If you even think you 
        may be late - camp here.<br>
        <br>
        Information on Faydedar<br>
        <br>
        Faydedar is a level 55 Dragon with a 300-500 AoE Lava Breath Weapon. His 
        Breath Weapon will dispel one buff. Right Click items are handy. 
        Faydedar will dual hit in the low - mid 300s. To land spells on 
        Faydedar, you must be in Melee range. Anyone sitting during the battle 
        will be instantly moved to the top of the Hate list. No one sits - 
        period.<br>
        <br>
        Buffing:<br>
        <br>
        When you show up, you will dispel and drop ALL buffs. Due to Faydedar's 
        dispel, you will have 3 or 4 Junk Buffs prior to the battle beginning. 
        All Priest Classes will Obtain a Mod Rod from a Mage if present.<br>
        <br>
        Buff Order:<br>
        Caster - See Invis<br>
        Caster - Resist Cold<br>
        Caster - Resist Poison<br>
        Shaman - Talisman of Altuna <br>
        Shaman - Harnessing of Spirit<br>
        Cleric - Shield of Words <br>
        Cleric - Heroism | Druid NatureSkin<br>
        Cleric - Symbol of Marzin.<br>
        Enchanter - Rune V (MA Only)<br>
        Enchanter - haste (Anya's Quickening)<br>
        Druid/Shaman - Regrowth<br>
        Druid - Circle of Winter OR Circle of Seasons<br>
        Mage - Boon of Immolation (+ FR!)<br>
        Ranger - Call of Earth<br>
        Paladin - Divine Glory<br>
        <br>
        Positioning and Battle:<br>
        <br>
        The MA will be near the pier. The Monk Puller will be in the water.<br>
        <br>
        EVERYONE Else - will be near the (NOTE: NOT ON) the wall by the dwarf. 
        NO ONE will be sitting. No one will be CASTING, and No Bards will be 
        SINGING. THERE ARE NO PETS.<br>
        <br>
        The Druid will then turn the Froglok Essence into the dwarf - this will 
        trigger Faydedar (You get the Froglok Item Back). Faydedar will Dragon 
        Roar. Monk will pull Fay to the shore and FD, MA will then gain Aggro. 
        If MA is 56, and you have a large number of healers - MA should use 
        Furious Disc. Priest Classes will use Remedy, Devine Light, Super Heal, 
        and Chloroblast to Keep the MA Alive (No Cheal Rotation).<br>
        <br>
        Once MA Has aggro, he will call attack. NOW the other Tanks leave the 
        caster area and assist on the Dragon. If you have never seen Faydedar, 
        he is not Large, he looks like the Velium Crawlers in Crystal Caverns - 
        LOOK DOWN. When the tanks are sent in, Pet users may NOW summon pets and 
        send them in. This is so they don't aggro upon the Dragon's Roar 
        Faydedar opens the battle with. <br>
        <br>
        Bards will not sing UNTIL they are in Melee range of Faydedar. </font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><br>
        Shamans and Druids will also help toss smaller heals on people caught in 
        Faydedar's Lava Breath.<br>
        Bards should be playing Elemental Rhythm/Chorus<br>
        <br>
        At 60%: Slower/Tasher/Debuffer Should Enter Melee Range.<br>
        You Have *one* Shot at this. Tash, Attempt to slow, Malo line, etc.<br>
        <br>
        At 50%: Int Casters enter Melee range and Nuke.<br>
        <br>
        At 40%: Use Offensive Discs, Including Deadeye, Charge /Mighty Strike, 
        Inner Flame.<br>
        <br>
        Continue until Dead.<br>
        <br>
        Faydedar ONLY Drops a Pod of Seawater for the Druid Epic. This item can 
        be Multiquested. The Timer on this mobs body is 30 minutes.<br>
        <br>
        IF YOU FAIL:<br>
        <br>
        Faydedar will despawn in about 40ish min of NOT BEING AGGROED. So, head 
        back to Oasis, and WAIT outside the outer wall. Trackers will give the 
        all clear to enter the oasis for rezzing.</font></td>
