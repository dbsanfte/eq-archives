  <font face="Arial">In the Library at Planes of Knowledge, there are tomes that

  of the Unkempt Warders.</font><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><strong>
  Unkempt Warders Vol. III</strong><br>
  <br>
  Udos-Ehai Digowa commanded the druid to remain in the forest and share with 
  the humans his magic and ways. If ever the druid should attempt to flee the 
  forest confines, the Tribe of the Moon would kill him, for they are always 
  watching. However, Wegadas was not to corrupt the knowledge and ways that the 
  Gihjna had taught the humans. Wegadas agreed without argument and the Lujien 
  pack faded silently into the shadows, leaving the wounded elf to the human 
  tribe to fulfull the demands that would guarantee his continued life. Wegadas 
  learned the language of the humans to perfection in this first fortnight. With 
  communication established, Wegadas learned the ways that the Gihjna had taught 
  the humans - finding them intriguing and immediately adapting them as his own 
  for sake of the people now in his care and in respect to the native bestial 
  tribes that spared his life.<br>
  <br>
  Over the first years, Wegadas taught the human tribe the ways of the 
  wilderness - he spoke to them of Tunare, The Mother of All; the great goddess 
  of growth and nature. He taught them how to pay their respects to his own 
  goddess without a prayer or sacrifice - only that they must respect the power 
  of the natural world, for as it had given them life; it can just as easily and 
  without warning take it from them. This is a law that should be neither feared 
  nor hated but one that is given the respect of an inevitable reality and one 
  that cannot be altered by steel or mind.<br>
  <br>
  The humans clung to Wegadas' liberal preaching and lessons, embracing the 
  matron goddess of growth as their own. Soon thereafter, the humans would learn 
  the ways of the druid - adapting and wielding the magic that Wegadas taught 
  them, and that they taught themselves at an exceptional rate. Rangers would be 
  the first of the master adepts, howerver, for the magic within them was less 
  than their druid compatriots and the ferocity of the wild had already been 
  established in their ways.<br>
  <br>
  As the human tribe became established, Udos-Ehai Digowa and the Gihjna elder, 
  Etsi Agal-Iha (Mother of the Light) returned to the human tribe. The tribes of 
  the Dawn and Moon established the laws of the wild: none of Wegadas' tribe was 
  to leave the forest, and if they attempted to do so, they would be killed. 
  They were children of the wild now, and their attempts to see the outside 
  world would corrupt them. The tribes of the Dawn and Moon also established 
  that all who entered the forest would be driven out or destroyed at the 
  discretion of Wegadas and the tribe.<br>
  <br>
  The third law was that the Lujien and Gihjna would remain out of the human 
  tribe's affairs - so long as they maintained the order the Gihjna had given 
  the generations past, and that they did not stray from their duties to the 
  forest that has accepted them as its children.<br>
  <br>
  The laws were agreed upon with Wegadas' leadership, for the human tribe 
  trusted his wisdom and guidance explicitly. Satisfied, the solar and lunar 
  tribes departed, although their eyes never strayed from their human guests.<br>
  <br>
  It was in those first years that Wegadas' intrigue with the humans grew to 
  tightly woven kinship. Slowly, he released his grip on his elven life and 
  embraced the fledgling existence and culture that he was instrumental in 
  fathering. The elven druid was Fier'dal no more, his brethren were no longer 
  human - they were all children of the wild and it was then that Wegadas 
  learned a true peace.<br>
  <br>
  Finding his true purpose and never longing for the life he abandoned, Wegadas 
  would spend nearly a century composing what would become the most revered and 
  sacred of relics to the homid tribe of the redwood forest - the Writ of the 
  Wild.<br>
  <br>
  This sacred tome detailed Wegadas' rebirth into the wilderness per his own 
  perspective, as well as the laws that he had established and his people 
  followed. The tome also detailed the Lujien and Gihjna culture and their 
  ancient tales and religion that Wegadas had been privy to in the several 
  centuries he dwelled among them. </font></p>
