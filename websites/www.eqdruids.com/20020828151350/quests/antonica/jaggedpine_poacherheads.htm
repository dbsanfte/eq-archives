    <p>You say, 'Hail, Randel Stormwind' <br>
    <br>
    Randel Stormwind says 'Well met, Scytalle. This has been a very stressful 
    time for many of us and some of us have been kind of edgy lately. We've 
    lived here for generations and in relative seclusion and we enjoyed a simple 
    life for the most part. Unfortunately, this was not to last and the sudden 
    [change] has left many on edge.' <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'what change' <br>
    <br>
    Randel Stormwind says 'There are a lot of people that resent the outsiders 
    and view their presence as corrupting our way of life. It's more then just 
    the new guards and the sudden influx of people though. This is sort of a 
    long story that begins when my grandfather was just a lad. It was during the 
    rule of Antonius III that public [access] to the Jaggedpine Forest [was 
    restricted].' <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'why was access restricted' <br>
    <br>
    Randel Stormwind says 'The Protectors of the Pine became concerned when 
    adventurers began wandering through Jaggedpine Forest and into the Unkempt 
    Wood. Most that did were never heard from ever again. The residents of 
    Surefall feared retaliation from the Unkempt for those trespassing into 
    their territory and Antonius smartly reasoned that if Surefall Glade were to 
    be taken, Qeynos would surely be next. So he declared Jaggedpine Forest and 
    all points eastward off limits. So it was just our ancestors that dwelled on 
    the [Throne of Karana's Fury].' <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'what throne of karanas fury' <br>
    <br>
    Randel Stormwind says 'Yes, that was what this place was called until 
    recently but I'll get to that part in a minute. We who acted as stewards 
    were allowed to come and go as we pleased through Surefall Glade. For the 
    longest time things were peaceful. Sure, we had problems with the odd 
    [poacher] here or there but for the most part it was peaceful. However, 
    trouble began when an [outsider] snuck through Surefall Glade and entered 
    the Unkempt Wood.' <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'what poacher' <br>
    <br>
    Randel Stormwind says 'Yes poachers often sneak in and mindlessly kill our 
    sacred bears for their skins. Often they'll kill a mother bear and leave 
    their cubs for dead. If I am able, I'll take the cub and raise it. If I do 
    my job well, I'm able to release the bear back into the wild once it is old 
    enough to fend for itself. There is one [group] of poachers I'm particularly 
    worried about though.' <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'what group' <br>
    <br>
    Randel Stormwind says 'They are a pair of ne'er-do-well couples that have 
    been terrorizing the animals recently, killing and maiming every creature 
    they happen across. It's their sick idea of sport. They need to be stopped. 
    They call themselves the [Pirates of the Pine].' <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'what pirates of the pine' <br>
    <br>
    Randel Stormwind says 'They are a bunch of good for nothing lowlives! I 
    would stop them myself but sadly, I lack skill with a weapon. You on the 
    other hand, look like you can handle yourself pretty well. If you are able 
    to bring these four to justice, return to me with proof. You will be justly 
    compensated for your efforts.' <br>
    <br>
    Hand him 4 heads from Poacher camp at -700 -1300... they drop off rare 
    spawned named respectively. <br>
    <br>
    Head of Elishia Blackguard <br>
    Head of Reynold Blackguard <br>
    Head of Vaurien Sticklebush <br>
    Head of Zed Sticklebush <br>
    <br>
    Randel Stormwind says 'Great Karana's blessing!! I see justice by your hand 
    is both swift and eternal. I would never have had the skill nor the heart to 
    carry out these miscreant's punishment the way you have. I'm glad to call 
    you a friend and not an enemy. Well, I did promise just compensation for 
    your efforts and I'm true to my word. Please take this ring as a token of my 
    gratitude.' <br>
