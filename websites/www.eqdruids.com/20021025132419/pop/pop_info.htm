  The Plane of Knowledge:<br>
  ---<br>
  This zone appears to be non-kos to all. I safely conned an othmir and the 
  necro/sks didn't aggro me either.<br>
  <br>
  Seems to be layed out in the following fashion:<br>
  <br>
  ###################<br>
  #----#-------#----#<br>
  #----#-------#----#<br>
  #-----------------#<br>
  #----####-####----#<br>
  #----#-------#----#<br>
  #----#-------#----#<br>
  #----#-------#----#<br>
  ###################<br>
  <br>
  You could also think of it maybe as a three-leaf clover without the stem -- 
  I'll let some map guru figure out the details.<br>
  <br>
  The zone is laid out into two main courtyards. There is the upper courtyard 
  and the lower courtyard. The upper courtyard contains the library which 
  contains spells and various undetermined merchants. The lower courtyard 
  contains all of the usual merchants and a bank as well as the portal pedestals 
  to all of the other Norrath zones.<br>
  <br>
  Pedestals were found to the Nexus and to the Great Divide. I did not find any 
  to Cobalt Scar or Iceclad or Eastern Wastes or any other zones in Luclin 
  except for the Nexus.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to Norrath zones -- there is a pedestal that takes you to the 
  Plane of Tranquility.<br>
  <br>
  The druid spell vendors can be found on the entry-level floor of the library. 
  One of the vendors sells some of our new spells -- the ones that are pre-61: 
  Pet shrinking spell (i forget the name); Ring of Knowledge, Circle of 
  Knowledge and one more that I forget.<br>
  <br>
  The bank was at either n440, n400 or p440, p400 - I forget.<br>
  <br>
  Your entrance to the other planes is via the Plane of Tranquility.<br>
  <br>
  Pedestals you click to enter them.<br>
  <br>
  ---<br>
  Plane of Tranquility<br>
  ---<br>
  <br>
  This is a big island. Many planar entrances will not let you enter unless you 
  'are worthy'. My guess is to keep us newbies out until we are well ready to 
  zone in to die. If so, kudos Verant -- rez hell on opening day is just no fun.<br>
  <br>
  Planes that appear to be open from the get-go include: Plane of Disease (big 
  sludge spewing pipe), Plane of Nightmares (bent rusty empty kiddies-pool 
  looking thing in-between one of the two sets of buildings), Plane of 
  Innovation (in the windmill), Plane of Justice (the scales) and possibly Plane 
  of Fire (I didn't have the guts to click it after talking to the dragon -- who 
  'might' have made me 'worthy').<br>
  <br>
  First looks indicate that the Planes are agro-free at the zone ins so long as 
  you don't move too far in.<br>
  <br>
  Since the folks I saw in the Plane of Justice were naked as jay-birds when I 
  zoned in I decided not to wander. Plane of Disease I have yet to explore at 
  all, but I hear that there is a disease affect that sucks your HP to some 
  degree unless you have disease resists.<br>
  <br>
  ---<br>
  Plane of Innovation<br>
  ---<br>
  <br>
  Entry mobs hit hard to me (a druid with 850ish AC) -- 230s to 240s. They 
  double attack and kick, bash. They appear to be warriors.<br>
  <br>
  There are roamers, albeit sparse that I noticed.<br>
  <br>
  These can be root rotted easily. They have high HP - probably near an 
  Elysian's.<br>
  <br>
  They did not summon at the entrance.<br>
  <br>
  I tried to quad kite them but there is hardly any room to do so, as such I was 
  kiting right at the zone in and probably scared the bejesuz out of everyone 
  zoning in. Agro appears to stay with you well so shouldn't be much of a 
  problem unless you zone leaving ensnared mobs there to greet people.<br>
  <br>
  There is a little lamp at the zone-in that takes you out of the zone.<br>
  <br>
  Very cramped space to try quading in here -- occasional roamers can really 
  mess it up (you start out in a little 'gully' of sorts)<br>
  <br>
  They drop NO DROP tinkering type stuffs which still have an unknown use to me.
  <br>
  <br>
  Don't even think of quading here unless you have a huge mana pool, kei, mask, 
  potg, and some flowing thought. You will probably @#%$ people off too if you 
  do it at the zoneline as more people get there.<br>
  <br>
  I did not get any faction hits for kills.<br>
  <br>
  -- No phat loot on entry mobs<br>
  <br>
  ---<br>
  Plane of Nightmares<br>
  ---<br>
  <br>
  Much like fear's look, but darker. Nothing like Kithicor dark though -- more 
  like Burning woods dark. Trees are much further spread out than the heavily 
  forested areas of Burning woods.<br>
  <br>
  You zone in near a building. The zone out exit is something you click in the 
  building.<br>
  <br>
  Fire spells seem to stick well here.<br>
  <br>
  Zone-in is agro free. I did not get any faction hits for kills.<br>
  <br>
  Mobs hit harder - 230 to 270s, double, have MORE hps. None summoned at the 
  zone in area.<br>
  <br>
  Killed spiders, bats, Treants (ya i'm a druid -- no faction), ravens.<br>
  <br>
  -- No phat loot on entry mobs<br>
  <br>
  Is more efficient to root/rot here than quad kite I found (even with all my 
  gear I had to med-kite).</font></b><![if !supportLineBreakNewLine]><![endif]></p>

  I think you have to kill some rat spawn around the entrance to the Plane of 
  Disease and turn it in to someone in PoT. Does anyone have any info on this?<br>
  <br>
  Plane of Innovation<br>
  In PoT this gnome at the wind mill asks you to collect a bunch of tinkering 
  items to fix one of the broken parts on the wind mill. Does anyone know if 
  that stuff is store bought in the old world?</font></b></p>

  PoF: got word that I was flagged to enter zone, but not able to. Not sure if 
  more then just talking to the drake is enough.<br>

  PoD: can zone in by just going down the sewer looking water. Just watch the 
  stone building in the zone. Stuff sees invis and hits for 600's.<br>

  PoI:<br>
  To zone in click on the gear that isn't turning on the clock (look up). Zone 
  in is usually clear, but there are roamers and people fight here. Didn't go 
  too far in, but there are alley ways that you have to follow, with mobs 
  spawning along those. The only mobs that saw my invis were Archaic Models (or 
  something like that), I was also told they summon, and someone else said they 
  are immune to speed changes. The mobs hits for 200-250ish, and are easily root 
  rotted. The spaces can get a little cramped, and there are roamers, but they 
  don't break root very often, so I had 3 going when I got adds. The only drop I 
  got was a Moonstone Crystal, and no PP. I also foraged a clockwork grease, 
  that the elder talks about needing in the windmill, but neither him or his 
  assistant would take it. To zone out click on the box looking thing near where 
  you zone in.<br>
  <br>
  PoJ:<br>
  I hated this zone, but it got better. I just explored it, didn't kill 
  anything, but its like a prison, with harder prisoners on the lower levels. 
  The lower mobs are KoS (threateningly, at least to me) and aggroed when I 
  opened the doors. They aren't really hard, but the guards that wonder around 
  will assist them and they hit like trains. Most things don't see invis. I 
  found a secret door in a wall, that lead to a tunnel (escape tunnel?). It had 
  mobs that looked like Geoids, some that saw invis, and &quot;Mindless tunnelers&quot; 
  that did see invis, all were scowling. After more exploring I found some High 
  Guardians of Justice(5), all level 60, that seemed to be guarding a door. I 
  opened it and a punisher and a enforcer who both saw invis and were scowling 
  came after me, and the Guards helped again. I think one will have to fight 
  through there (probably the really bad prisoners) to get to the 7th hammer. I 
  did find the tribunal though, they look awesome. I wanted to see how hard they 
  hit so took a swing, they DT and hit me for 550, and 709 if anyone is 
  interested, but my friend said the others didn't agro(I think I died too 
  fast). If you can't find your corpse, don't worry, after 10 mins it will 
  reappear in the graveyard( the zone in). There was a group hunting there that 
  said they were getting faction hits (guards/prisoners) but the exp was 
  amazing. The zone out is a prison door near the first ramp to get into the 
  prison (I'll post directions/locs when I get them).<br>
  <br>
  PoD:<br>
  Seemed kind of boring to me. There were already exp groups set up there, so I 
  went exploring and died a bunch. Pestilent or something like that rats were 
  too high to charm. Spider things were necros (at least the ones I got) and 
  liked to cast, alot. Couldn't find anything fun to do here so I didn't stay 
  long. No loot, no pp =-/ Decent exp (using the charm solo thing someone else 
  suggested)<br>
  <br>
  PoN:<br>
  Where my most recent corpses have been resting, luckily there is a graveyard 
  here too, so its like a free summon. Things here like PoI, but a bit harder. 
  260+ish hits, lots of hps (Wrath+DoD+WD with extended affliction took to about 
  72ish health, I don't feel like doing the math so figure it out yourself =-P. 
  Didn't last long here, seemed like a fun zone, but once you get a couple of 
  adds it hurts. Nothing summoned, just tons of hps and hit hard, seemed easy 
  enough to root rot, but I'll let you know when I live longer than 5 mins. Zone 
  out is in the building, stone sign just like PoK ports.</font></b></p>
