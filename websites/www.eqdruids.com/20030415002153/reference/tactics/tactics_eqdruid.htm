Contrary to popular belief, druids require a high level of player skill and intelligence to utilize and showcase all the class' versatility and abilities to their fullest.</p><p>One of the goals of this guide will be to instruct a young druid in some the many strategies available to the class.</p><p>Another goal will be to provide information concerning hunting grounds and general tips to help reduce the time required to obtain level 19.</p><p><a name=1-4><font face=Arial size=3 color=008000><b>Levels 1 - 4</b></font></a><p>These levels are considered the "newbie" or "lowbie" levels. Because these levels are similar for all classes, the main objectives are to learn your surroundings, get a "feel" for your spells, and to advance in level as quickly as possible.</p><p><u><b>Druids begin in three cities</b></u>:<ul> <li><b>Kelethin</b> <li><b>Rivervale</b> <li><b>Surefall Glades</b></ul><p><u><b>Druid race and deity combinations, and starting city</b></u><b>:</b><ul><b> <li>Wood Elf + Tunare = Kelethin <li>Halfling + Karana = Rivervale <li>Human + Karana = Surefall Glades <li>Human + Tunare = Surefall Glades <li>Half Elf + Tunare = Kelethin <li>Half Elf + 
  Karana = Surefall Glades</b></ul><p>Depending on what race you choose, begin by seeking out your guild leader.</p><p>In Kelethin, the druid guild leader is <b>Heartwood Master</b> (loc -636.25, 214.36, 77.26). He can be found in the building marked "<b>Soldiers of Tunare</b>". The building will be very close to your starting point. Be very careful when running around Kelethin, as you can fall to your death very easily.</p><p>In Rivervale, the druid guild leader is <b>Hibbs Rootenpaw</b> (loc -37.27, -425.10, -11.81). He will be inside a house adjacent to a field. In the middle of the field will be <b>Shakey Scarecrow</b>. Finding your way around Rivervale can be confusing, so if it's necessary, ask for assistance.</p><p>In Surefall Glade, the druid guild leader is <b>Te 'Anara</b> (loc -206.23, -439.07, 6.75). She will be present in a open building near the Jaggedpine Treefolk building. You will start out in front of the ranger hall. If you are human, and it is night, it's recommended that you wait until daybreak, or you ask the assistance of someone with night-vision.</p><p>If you are starting in Kelethin, read <a href=../starting_guides/kelethin_start.htm>this guide</a> to find your way from your initial start point, to the guild trainer, and finally to your first hunting area. If you are starting in Rivervale, read <a href=../starting_guides/rivervale_start.htm>this guide</a>. If you are starting in Surefall Glades, read <a href=../starting_guides/surefall_start.htm>this guide</a>.</p><p><u><b>Starting equipment list</b></u>:<ul> <li>Spell scroll: Minor Healing <li>Spell scroll: Skin Like Wood <li>"a tattered note" (guild note) <li>candle (human-only) <li>bread cakes (no-drop) <li>skin of milk (no-drop) <li>club (no-drop)</ul><p>Your guild leader will provide you with a starting tunic once you turn in your note.</p><p>Equip your starting equipment, and scribe and memorize your starting spells (<b>Skin Like Wood</b> and <b>Minor Healing</b>). Once you have done this, head out into your first hunting area.</p><p>For information about creating macros for your socials, try <a href=http://www.eqguild.net/macros.html>this guide to macros</a>.</p><p>Learn to /con all your targets prior to attacking. Focus on attacking targets that /con even (white) or yellow. Because you do not start with an offensive spell, melee will be your primary method of defeating your opponent until you can purchase some spells.</p><p>Loot <u>everything</u> from your kills, and sell them to the nearest vendor. Once you obtain 7 or 8 gold pieces, purchase a backpack. Also, research your starting zone to see if there are any <a href=../../quests/quest_main.htm>quest</a> givers that hand out containers. And while you are researching quests, look for any low-level armor quests that you may be able to complete.</p><p>It's always a good idea to begin <b>Tailoring</b> at these levels. Purchase a small sewing kit and begin combining items from the creatures you kill to advance your skill and provide yourself with some patchwork armor. If you don't wish to begin Tailoring, collect the various pelts and silks to sell to aspiring tailors later.</p><p>Don't concern yourself with dying just yet. You won't lose any experience from death until level 11, and prior to level 10, you will return to your bind point with all of your equipment, including your food and milk. Use this to your advantage should you start to run low on food and water, and don't have the funds to purchase more.</p><p>A good, and rarely used, method of obtaining money at these low levels is <b>Fishing</b>. Create a hotkey for this skill. Purchase a fishing pole from a vendor (around 2 gold pieces) and some bait (a few copper pieces each). Find a pool of water, equip the pole in your primary hand, and begin fishing. Typically you will begin to catch rusty daggers, tattered sandals, fish scales, and fresh fish. The scales and fish are stackable. The fish will fetch the highest price, but sell everything back to the vendor, and repeat until you have sufficient funds. Be careful, as your pole can break (it will break less often as you increase your skill).</p><p><b>Note:</b> You will want to train with a druid trainer when you achieve level 4 (make sure to put one of your training points into Channeling).</p><center><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td><font face=Arial size=2><u><b><a href=http://www.eqdruids.com/spells/level1spells.htm>Recommended Level 1 Spells</a>:</b></u><ul> <li>Skin Like Wood <li>Snare <li>Minor Healing</ul></font></td></tr><tr><td><font face=Arial size=2><u><b>Recommended Zones:</b></u><ul> <li>Greater Faydark <li>Steamfont <li>Butcherblock Mountains <li>Misty Thicket <li>West Freeport / East Freeport <li>North Qeynos <li>Qeynos Hills</ul></font></td></tr><tr><td><font face=Arial size=2><p align=left><b><u>Greater Faydark:</u></b></p><p>Hunt bats, spiders, and wasp drones.

You will need to concentrate on saving your money for your level 9 spells, so don't concern yourself with upgrading any armor right now. You may want to pick up a rusty scimitar to practice your one handed slash (1hs), but other than that stick with what you have. If you find yourself with an ample amount of money in the bank, you can try purchasing some mana equipment.</p><p>At level 5, you receive the spell <b>Harmony</b>. This is a great spell for separating groups within a camp. Harmony will put the mobs under a short lasting "lull" allowing you to pull only one. Watch for the particle effects around their feet to 
  gauge the range of the spell.</p><p>Use it to your advantage and often. For example, you can use this spell to hunt safely at the goblin camps in Misty Thicket, without having all the goblins gang up on you. You'll start to get better loot and coin drops, which helps in purchasing that next round of spells.</p><p>For more information on using Harmony effectively, read <a href=tactics_harmony.htm>this guide</a>.</p><p>At this point, the mobs are going to be more difficult to kill. If you find that you're constantly running out of mana, and running to the guards for help, try sticking with anything that /cons blue.</p><p><b>Foraging</b> is an important skill to begin practicing. Create a hotkey, and click it every time it becomes available. You will generally be foraging <b>pods of water</b>, <b>roots</b>, <b>vegetables</b>, <b>rabbit meat</b>, <b>fishing grubs</b>, <b>berries</b>, and <b>fruit</b>. Save <u>everything</u>. All foraged items, except the grubs, can be used as a food and water source. Grubs can be used as free bait to practice your Fishing skill. Rabbit meat, vegetables, berries, and fruit can be used in the <b>Baking</b> skill. Berries, fruit, vegetables, roots, and the pods of water can be used in the <b>Brewing</b> skill. A nice method of raising money is to sell these tradeskill components to players looking to practice Baking and Brewing.</p><p><b>Note:</b> You will want to train with a druid trainer when you achieve level 5 (Foraging) and level 8 (Meditate). You will need to put one training point into each skill to begin increasing your skill. Simply sit down, or open your 
  spell book to begin meditating.</p><center><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td><font face=Arial size=2><u><b><a href=http://www.eqdruids.com/spells/level_5_spells.htm>Recommended Level 5 Spells</a>:</b></u><ul> <li>Burst of Fire <li>Invoke Lightning <li>Grasping Roots <li>Camouflage <li>Harmony <li>Gate</ul></font></td></tr><tr><td><font face=Arial size=2><u><b>Recommended Zones:</b></u><ul> <li>Greater Faydark <li>Steamfont <li>Butcherblock Mountains <li>Misty Thicket <li>East Commonlands <li>North Qeynos <li>Qeynos Hills</ul></font></td></tr><tr><td><font face=Arial size=2><p><b><u>Greater Faydark:</u></b></p><p>Orc Hill<br> Crushbone near the zone line</p><p><b><u>Misty Thicket:</u></b></p><p>Go out past the wall.

The same holds true for <b>Ignite</b> and Burst of Fire. You also receive your first Coat spell in <b>Thistlecoat</b>, providing a long-lasting self-only damage shield. Your first strength buff is also available at this level in <b>Strength of Earth</b>, making it much easier to not become encumbered. And your first damage shield spell becomes available in <b>Shield of Thistles</b>, increasing your damage output when meleeing.</p><p>Another useful spell that druids receive at this level is <b>Treeform</b>. This spell gives you the illusion of a tree, and increases your natural hitpoint regeneration, but restricts your mobility. It also has the added bonus of changing your faction standing with many creatures and NPC's, thus allowing you to rest in areas where you would have been attacked normally. You can fight, cast, meditate, and interact with vendors while in treeform. You just can't move.</p><p>You will still be meleeing, but with the increased effectiveness of your spells, you will begin to notice that you will be meleeing less frequently. As you advance in level, melee damage will chiefly be used to 
  supplement your spell damage.</p><p>Prior to this level, you were generally looting everything from your kills and selling them, regardless of price. Now you can afford to be a little bit more selective as to what you loot, because the value of the drops will begin to increase. Concentrate on looting weapons, armor, and stackable items such as pelts. Any items used in tradeskills, such as quality pelts (low, medium, and high) and silks, should be hoarded and sold to players practicing tradeskills.</p><p>If you choose to hunt <a href=http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=134>Will-O-Wisps</a> at these levels, their drops (<b>Greater Lightstones</b> and <b>Lightstones</b>) will be your chief source of income. Many players choose to sell the Greater Lightstones to players, and the Lightstones to vendors.</p><p>Because they are magical creatures, they can only be damaged using spells or magic weapons. You will need to obtain a magic weapon in order to damage these wisps should you melee them. For 1hd blunt, a <b>Velium Warhammer</b> is recommended (usually given away by high-level players). For 1hd slash, a <b>Velium Scimitar</b> (usually given away by high-level players), or a <b>Combine Scimitar</b> (purchased from vendors) is recommended. For 2hd blunt, a <b>Ketchata Koro Mis</b> (usually given away by high-level players) or a <b>Runed Totem Staff</b> (also given away by high-level players) is recommended. The <b>Bloodforge Hammer</b> can also be obtained via this <a href=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=641>quest</a>.</p><p>While you can raise a good bit of money quickly this way, I recommend that you hold onto them and head to North Karana. There you will find a Gypsy camp and an NPC named <b>Mrysila</b>. When you Hail her, she will give out a quest for <a href=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=374>Research Aids</a>. When you turn in a Lightstone to her, she will reward you with a <b>Runes & Research Volume I</b> or <b>Runes & Research Volume II</b> and experience. These can be sold back to her for a little bit of money.</p><p>When you turn in a Greater Lightstone to her, she will reward you with a <b>Concordance of Research</b> and experience. This can also be sold back to her, for a considerable profit (usually between 7 and 8 platinum pieces). This Concordance is a container, and containers can not be placed within other containers, so make sure you have one or two general inventory slots available. Also, only give her one Greater Lightstone at a time, and once you get the Concordance, sell it back to her immediately.</p><p>Handing in large quantities of Lightstones and Greater Lightstones is also a nice way to receive additional noticeable (and free) experience. This will assist you in advancing through these levels that much more quickly.</p><center><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td><font face=Arial size=2><u><b><a href=http://www.eqdruids.com/spells/level_9_spells.htm>Recommended Level 9 Spells</a>:</b></u><ul> <li>Light Healing <li>Strength of Earth <li>Ignite <li>Shield of Thistles <li>Thistlecoat <li>Treeform</ul></font></td></tr><tr><td><font face=Arial size=2><u><b>Recommended Zones:</b></u><ul> <li>Crushbone <li>Steamfont <li>Butcherblock Mountains <li>Misty Thicket <li>East and West Commonlands <li>Lavastorm Mountains <li>Northern Desert of Ro <li>Erud's Crossing</ul></font></td></tr><tr><td><font face=Arial size=2><p><b><u>Crushbone:</u></b></p><p>Kill blue/even orcs near the zone.

Orc camp or giant wasps can be done solo.</p><p><b><u>East Commons:</u></b></p><p>Orc camps, young kodiaks, lions, and giant scarabs.

Using this buff in conjunction with snare, will allow you to &quot;kite&quot; many targets. It will also increase your margin for error, as you will now be able to easily outrun your target.</p><p><b>Kiting</b> is limiting your target's movement using snare and damaging it with spells. All while maintaining a safe distance from the target, so as not to take melee damage. This works well for warrior-type targets, but not so well for caster-types, as they can still hit you with their spells. An effective and safe method of hunting, and with SoW, safety is increased dramatically.</p><p><b>Bind Affinity</b> is another extremely useful spell that you acquire at level 14. It will allow you to change your bind point, and that of other players. Definitely needed should you choose to venture further from your starting city.</p><p>Both spells can also be quite the money generators. You can take yourself to a crowded zone, such as Oasis, and offer to SoW players for some donations. You can usually get anywhere from 1 - 5 platinum pieces per cast, up to 10 if someone is feeling generous. Bind affinity is desired in bind areas where Soulbinders are not available. Places like the gypsy camp in North Karana, or Highpass Hold are places where this spell's usefulness is desired.</p><p>Another useful spell 
  acquired at level 14 is <b>Stinging Swarm</b>. It is the first magic-based Damage over Time (DoT) spell for druids, and is most effective when &quot;rotting&quot; your target.</p><p><b>Rotting</b> is achieved by doing the following:<ol> <li>Snare your target <li>Stop your target's movement completely using <b>Grasping Roots</b> (level 5) <li>Cast Stinging Swarm on your target <li>Meditate while the target is immobilized and the DoT is working <li>Recast snare, root, or swarm if and when it becomes necessary, until your target is dead</ol><p></p><p>One problem you may encounter with Stinging Swarm is a high fizzle rate. The skill needed to cast it successfully is <b>Conjuration</b>. Chances are, your skill in Conjuration is lacking, since there really was no need for you to practice it until now. However, this can be easily remedied. Simply memorize either the <b>Summon Food</b> or <b>Summon Water</b> spell (or both), and conjure as much food and water as you can hold. Continue to do this until your Conjuration skill is maxed for your level. You will now find that you will fizzle much less when casting Swarm.</p><p><b>Expulse Summoned</b> is another useful spell, as you can now inflict more damage per cast upon
  <a href="../summoned_animal/summoned_main.htm">summoned creatures</a>.</p><p>Another useful hunting strategy at these levels is charming. It involves the use of pets using the <b>Befriend Animal</b> spell, and is covered in more detail <a href=pets.htm>in this guide</a>.</p><p>Fear-kiting becomes viable at this level also, because you are hunting in areas with numerous animals. This technique is covered in more detail <a href=snareand.htm>in this guide</a>.</p><p>At these levels, buffing / binding for donations and collecting 
  lightstones will still be your main source of income. By now, you should have gathered enough money to purchase any remaining spells, and have enough left over to upgrade some of your equipment. At this stage, focus on obtaining equipment that will increase your <b>Wisdom</b> statistic, rather than mana.</p><p>You can also begin quests for some of the more desirable low-level equipment, such as the <a href=http://pub50.ezboard.com/feqdruids24038frm6.showMessage?topicID=86.topic>Tunare Symbols</a> or the <a href=../../quests/antonica/testament_vanear_a.htm>Testament of Vanear</a>.</p><p><b>Note:</b> You will want to train with a druid trainer when you achieve level 15 (make sure to put one of your training points into Dodge).</p><center><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td><font face=Arial size=2><u><b><a href=http://www.eqdruids.com/spells/level_14_spells.htm>Recommended Level 14 Spells</a>:</b></u><ul> <li>Skin Like Rock <li>Expulse Summoned <li>Stinging Swarm <li>Levitate <li>Befriend Animal <li>Bind Affinity <li>Summon Food <li>Summon Water</ul></font></td></tr><tr><td><font face=Arial size=2><u><b>Recommended Zones:</b></u><ul> <li>Oasis <li>Lavastorm Mountains <li>West Commonlands <li>East Karana <li>Unrest <li>Highhold Pass <li>Ocean of Tears <li>Paludal Caverns <li>Stonebrunt Mountains <li>Crushbone <li>The Overthere</ul></font></td></tr><tr><td><font face=Arial size=2><p><b><u>Lavastorm Mountains</u></b></p><p>Fire elementals, fire imps, and fire sprites are easy targets with Expulse Summoned.
