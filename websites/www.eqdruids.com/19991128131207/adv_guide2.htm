<p>Advanced Guide to Grouping for Druids II<br>
<br>
Rupert did a good job with his Advanced Guide to Grouping for Druids but<br>
there are still a couple of things that a Druid should know at any grouping<br>
level.<br>
<br>
General:<br>
<br>
One very important thing left out of the Guide to Grouping was the<br>
importance of a leader.&nbsp; Having one experienced person make the calls on<br>
when to pull, when to evac and when to move is priceless in a good group.<br>
If you join a pickup group ask the following questions (in no particular<br>
order):<br>
<br>
1) Who's the group leader?<br>
2) Who do I assist?<br>
3) What is everyone's role?<br>
4) How are we looting tonight?<br>
<br>
If you don't get decent answers to this initial set of questions...find<br>
another group.&nbsp; Trust me.&nbsp; There are more questions you can ask, more<br>
strategies and tactics you can confer about but if they can't answer these<br>
questions without a lot of contention (or blank stares), move on.<br>
<br>
During a fight, see if the group members are communicating.&nbsp; Since it takes<br>
a half dozen casts to get a snare on something, I tend to call out
&quot;snared&quot;<br>
when I finally land it.&nbsp; The puller often calls out what he's swinging at<br>
(or will be swinging at).&nbsp; Casters report LOM and OOM and so forth.<br>
<br>
/assist:<br>
<br>
A good grouper learns the power of /assist and social keys.&nbsp; I create a<br>
/assist PullerName social key to assist the puller and /assist Tank1 and<br>
/assist Tank2 as well.&nbsp; Get everyone in the party to agree to assist a<br>
designated person (generally the puller).<br>
<br>
The Secondary tank can first take a few swings on extra mobs first to get<br>
higher on their hate list before /assisting the primary.&nbsp; This helps out
the<br>
casters and healers in the group (a little anyway).&nbsp; NOTE: Don't do this if<br>
the enchanter is doing an AoE mez as the first spell.<br>
<br>
Crowd control folks can do what they do best...and without party members<br>
breaking their control (by swinging on them) because all the other party<br>
members are swinging on ONE mob.<br>
<br>
NOTE:&nbsp; I often wait a swing or two before hitting /assist.&nbsp; Sometimes<br>
/assist gives you the wrong mob if the puller is switching from what mob he<br>
used to pull to the real target.&nbsp; If I remember correctly, it also only<br>
works if the target is in auto-attack mode.<br>
<br>
Safety TIP: I used to only use a generic /assist hotkey (no name) after<br>
selecting a party member but switched to using /assist &lt;name&gt; after<br>
accidentally hitting the hotkey twice and doing something stupid to myself.<br>
<br>
Primary Healer:<br>
<br>
As suggested by Rupert, Greater Heal has it's drawbacks but if you are the<br>
primary healer, keep it mem'd.&nbsp; The regular 80 pts heal is just too weak to<br>
do much for tanks IMHO.&nbsp; With good crowd control you should be able to<br>
G'Heal your tank and not get obliterated.<br>
<br>
My rule of thumb for G'Heal vs Heal is I use the greater on the tanks when<br>
they get to the 2.5 bubbles of health range.&nbsp; I use heal on anyone under 2<br>
bubbles.&nbsp; This sounds kind of backwards but I've lost too many people<br>
because G'Heal took a tick too long to get off.&nbsp; YMMV.<br>
<br>
The trick to G'Heal is the same as the trick with big nukes.&nbsp; Timing.&nbsp;
Once<br>
the tanks have the target mob aggro'd enough, it wont switch.&nbsp; Often, if
the<br>
secondary tanks take a few swacks at the other mobs (enough to get one hit<br>
anyway) to get on their hate list and they've been damage shielded, the<br>
other mobs may not jump on you for one G'Heal.&nbsp; And of course, if the<br>
enchanter has mezzed everything, you can safely G'Heal to your heart's<br>
content.<br>
<br>
Safety TIP:&nbsp; If you are the primary healer, you cannot also be the primary<br>
evac person.&nbsp; If you happen to be the only priest class in the group and
you<br>
don't have a wizard then decide which you are.&nbsp; I've tried filling both<br>
roles at one time and there's nothing more frustrating than hitting your<br>
evac minimum and having to decide &quot;Should I let XXX die or heal him and
lose<br>
evac capability&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sooner or later you decide wrong.<br>
<br>
Secondary Healer:<br>
<br>
One thing that wasn't entirely clear: your job is to keep the primary healer<br>
alive.&nbsp; Often times you also pick up one of the casters to keep alive but<br>
generally, your healing mana will be spent on the cleric keeping her alive<br>
until the tanks can pull the aggro'd mobs off of her.<br>
<br>
Primary Evac:<br>
<br>
My primary evac strategy is to load up on agility and armor class at the<br>
expense of wisdom.&nbsp; Then the only thing I do is damage shields PRIOR to the<br>
fight and snares once the mob is down to half.&nbsp; Then I swing a lot and toss<br>
the occasional DD or DOT to finish a mob or the heal to keep the cleric up.<br>
Generally, I finish the fight with 80+ mana.<br>
<br>
Safety TIP: The PRIOR to the fight should be common sense but hey...I used<br>
to damage shield the puller on his way back in so it would last longer.&nbsp;
99%<br>
of the time this is okay.&nbsp; Don't do it as the evacer.&nbsp; The 1% of the
time<br>
it's not okay is the same time you need to evac.&nbsp; Never ever cast anything<br>
at the start of the fight as Primary Evac.<br>
<br>
Evacs generally happen in three circumstances:<br>
<br>
1) Bad pull.&nbsp; These are the easiest.&nbsp; Puller calls &quot;EVAC&quot;
you cast.<br>
Everyone is full health so should survive the trip.&nbsp; If the puller is<br>
bright, he gives himself enough time to get back for the trip home.&nbsp; If<br>
not...<br>
<br>
2) Runner.&nbsp; Someone missed a snare, you're all beat up to some degree or<br>
another and the group leader calls out &quot;Evac&quot;.&nbsp; This one is
sometimes<br>
iffy...which is why I like having AC, Agility and Dex over Wisdom as the<br>
primary evac.<br>
<br>
3) Train.&nbsp; This happens at the worst possible time...one second you're okay<br>
and the next you're in big trouble.&nbsp; As above, you're likely to get hit and<br>
this is when you earn your pay as primary evac.<br>
<br>
Note:&nbsp; I almost always use Succor Butcher once I get it.<br>
<br>
Snaring or Rooting:<br>
<br>
The way spells work right now, just snare.&nbsp; Not root, not ensnare...snare.<br>
It takes multiple casts to hit but it lasts 2 mins which generally is longer<br>
than the fight will last.&nbsp; Do NOT let other casters root.<br>
<br>
One thing you can do is once the mob turns to run (and just stands there) is<br>
to have the tanks switch to another mob.&nbsp; I don't know how many times I've<br>
seen tanks and wizards keep hitting/nuking some mob that could easily be<br>
DoT'd, resnared and ignored.<br>
<br>
Spells:<br>
<br>
One spell not on Rupert's list that I keep up all the time is Gate.&nbsp; It's
my<br>
personal escape for when the zone crashes and I reappear alone or I fall<br>
into a pit or whatever.&nbsp; It's also useful for when you've been playing<br>
healer, are LOM and the primary evacer just got obliterated by 3 ghoul<br>
wizards chain casting on her.<br>
<br>
Well there are more tips so I'm sure someone will come out with a Advanced<br>
Guide to Grouping for Druids III.&nbsp; There are other high level group tactics<br>
when hunting certain critters or when equipped with certain items.<br>
<br>
Good Hunting!<br>
