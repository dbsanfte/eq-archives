      </span>The enhancement gives Monks, Rogues and Warriors the ability to use 
      special skills in response to a mistake made by their opponent or an 
      exceptional move of their own.<span style>&nbsp; </span>This enhancement will 
      be in addition to the existing system, allowing players to use the skills

    <p align="left">
    <font face="Arial">This announcement popped up on EQLive a few nights ago by 
    mistake, and is finally live again :)</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span class="smalltitle">The Synarcana Raid Contest</span><br>
      <em>We, the Wayfarer's Brotherhood have discovered that powerful magical 
      energies of a scale never before experienced have been focused deep within 
      Miragul's Menagerie. Rumors persist that this magic is far more potent 
      than any seen before; so powerful that the magic has created a physical 
      form for itself. Deep within the heart of the Menagerie dwells this 
      creature of pure magical energy, a unique form of life we have dubbed the 
      Synarcana. </em></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><em>If left unchecked, the Synarcana could destroy 
      all of Antonica and warp the very foundation of our reality. The 
      Wayfarer's Brotherhood is seeking a band of adventurers brave and true to 
      root out the Synarcana before it becomes even more powerful. We are in 
      desperate need of your help to control the rising menace of this presence.</em>
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Beyond simple fame and bragging rights, one of the 
      living participants in the first raid to successfully complete this task 
      shall be rewarded with a gift from the real world. Curt Schilling, World 
      Series Co-MVP pitcher with the Arizona Diamondbacks (Officially now a 
      member of the Boston Red Sox), is so impressed by the incredible challenge 
      presented by the power of the Synarcana, that he has pledged to grant a 
      single signed jersey to one of the living participants of the first raid 
      to topple the Synarcana. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Do you have what it takes to destroy the mystical 
      menace of the Synarcana? Be the first to do so and win Curt Schilling's 
      jersey. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">The challenge officially begins Sunday, December 28, 
      2003, 5:00PM, Pacific Time. Our logs will determine who completes this 
      challenge. The raid must be completed inside the time limit, and not 
      during the 30 minutes after the raid is &quot;over.&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Good luck!</font></p>

    <normal>** Shadowhaven Casino goes on vacation **</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>We're sorry to have to say this, but the new casino has become too 
    popular. The huge number of players gambling at the casino is causing issues 
    with the servers, and has been responsible for a few zone crashes. 
    Unfortunately, this means that we have had to remove the casino NPCs until 
    after the New Year arrives.</normal> <br>
    <normal />
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>* Other Changes *</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Cancel magic will no longer remove disciplines or melee abilities.</normal>
    <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Fixed a bug that was causing the party to be unable to see hit 
    point updates for the last person to join their group.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Healing Will and Focused Will now stack with most other hit point 
    regeneration effects.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- Corrected a bug that was causing AAs to increase the duration of 
    combat abilities.</normal> <br>
    <normal /><br>
    <normal>- We have reorganized the context menu for Disciplines to make it a 
    bit more logical.</normal></font></p>

    Headlines! <br>
    <br>
    Melee Enhancements Part 1 <br>
    New Spell Effects Live <br>
    Casino Now Open In Shadowhaven <br>
    HEAR YE! HEAR YE! Check with your Town Crier for new editions of your 
    hometown paper! <br>
    <br>
    *** AA REFUND *** <br>
    <br>
    - Extended Notes 3 and Sionachie's Cresendo have been refunded (More details 
    below). If you had these bard AAs and were close to 30 AA points stored, 
    make certain that you spend enough points to have 30 or less unspent AA 
    points before you zone. All AA points over 30 are removed when you zone. <br>
    <br>
    - Improved Reclaim Energy has been refunded to magicians due to changes with 
    the amount of energy received when cannibalizing their pets. If you have 
    this Magician AA and were close to 30 AA points stored, make certain that 
    you spend enough points to have 30 or less unspent AA points before you 
    zone. All AA points over 30 are removed when you zone. <br>
    <br>
    ** Melee enhancements ** <br>
    <br>
    We have been building an enhancement to the melee system, and the first part 
    of it is now Live. <br>
    <br>
    The yellow bar now represents endurance rather than stamina. <br>
    <br>
    All Disciplines now require an expenditure of endurance to use. They still 
    have a re-use timer, and they can't be used more often than the timer 
    allows. <br>
    <br>
    Disciplines have now been divided into a few different timers. <br>
    <br>
    We have also added a few of the new melee skills to the game. These are the 
    skills that do not use the new &quot;opening&quot; system, but can be used without an 
    opening present. The &quot;reactionary&quot; skills and the opening system will remain 
    on Test for further tuning. <br>
    <br>
    Warriors have been given a mitigation boost. This affects all warriors at 
    all levels. <br>
    <br>
    Monks have been given the ability to dodge blows from attackers behind them. 
    This affects all monks with the Dodge ability. <br>
    <br>
    All existing disciplines can be purchased as tomes in either East Commons or 
    the Plane of Knowledge. To learn a discipline, the Tome must be turned into 
    your guildmaster. <br>
    <br>
    Several new disciplines have been added for warriors, monks and rogues who 
    are above level 60. <br>
    <br>
    ** Play King's Court in Shadowhaven! ** <br>
    <br>
    Shandeling's Roost in Shadowhaven now houses a game of chance. To play you 
    will need to buy a King's Court Token. You then take this token and turn it 
    in to any of the dealers. Based on what your hand turns out to be, you will 
    be awarded a prize. The highest hands will return a gold ticket as the 
    prize. This Ticket can be turned in to win prizes such as a Guise of the 
    Deceiver, Fungus Covered Great Staff, or Holgresh Elder Beads. Good luck to 
    all that play! <br>
    <br>
    ** Items ** <br>
    <br>
    - Purchased augments, that have not been bound to an item yet, can be sold 
    back to Dible Hedledrap in South Ro. <br>
    <br>
    - Caerlyna in the Bazaar will trade your containers for tokens and will 
    trade tokens for containers. This will allow player characters to sell those 
    tokens in the Bazaar. Folks that buy the tokens can then take them to the 
    Caerlyna and trade them in for the appropriate container. You can exchange 
    most weight reducing tradeable containers for a token. <br>
    <br>
    - We've changed the +12 Wis on the Copper Medal of Rapture to +12 Int. 
    Really, we have! <br>
    <br>
    - We have lowered the minimum duration to 5 ticks on Affliction Efficiency 
    I-IV and Affliction Haste I-IV foci. <br>
    <br>
    - Timeless Coral Greatsword will no longer claim to be out of charges when 
    it procs. If you own one of these swords, you will need to petition a GM and 
    ask them to replace your current Coral Greatsword with a new one. <br>
    <br>
    - Phylactery is no longer useable by all classes, only MAG NEC ENC WIZ CLR 
    SHA DRU. <br>
    <br>
    - The Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic now only procs for characters level 
    35 and above. <br>
    <br>
    - The following items that had the Invigor effect now have Serpent Sight or 
    Ultravision: Orb of the Crimson Bull, Abram's Axe of the Stoic, Tolan's 
    Darkwood Boots, Mrylokar's Greaves, Singing Steel Vambraces, Crown of Rile, 
    5 Dose Potion of Wolves Blood, 5 Dose Potion of Fleeting Languor, 10 Dose 
    Potion of Wolves Blood, 10 Dose Potion of Fleeting Languor, Potion of Wolves 
    Blood, Potion of Fleeting Languor, Spiroc Wingblade, Spirit Caller's Boots, 
    Spirit Weaver's Boots, Frozen Efreeti Boots, Ring of the Crimson Bull, Rune 
    Crafter's Boots, Wolf Caller's Boots and Camii's Bracer of Vigor. <br>
    <br>
    - The effects on Abram's Axe of the Stoic and Spiroc Wingblade are now Worn 
    to activate, not procs. <br>
    <br>
    ** Spells/Songs ** <br>
    <br>
    - New spell effects! Just about every spell in the game has been given a new 
    spell effect. If you have your spell effects turned off, you may want to 
    turn them back on. <br>
    <br>
    - Fixed the bard AA Channeling Focus. It was allowing 100% recovery from 
    missed notes in most instances. We have restored it to the 5%/10%/15% values 
    as documented in the AA window. <br>
    <br>
    - Fixed a problem with short-duration pets (Rage of Zomm, cleric hammers, 
    wizard flaming swords and such) so that they will no longer dissipate before 
    engaging the target NPC. <br>
    <br>
    - Reclaim Energy will now return 75 percent of the mana used to summon the 
    pet, 95 percent if the caster has Improved Reclaim Energy. <br>
    <br>
    - Lull spells with duration less than 5 should no longer be lasting as if 
    they had duration 5. This will reduce the duration of some lull-type spells 
    to their proper duration. <br>
    <br>
    - Fixed a problem that caused Protection of the Nine to block Blessing of 
    the Nine. <br>
    <br>
    - We corrected an issue where the same druid damage over-time spell cast on 
    an NPC by two different druids would not stack. <br>
    <br>
    - Bulwark of Vie was reducing spell damage as well as melee damage. It now 
    only reduces melee damage. <br>
    <br>
    - Eye of Zomm will no longer cause players summoned pets to suicide if 
    commanded to kill the eye. <br>
    <br>
    - Improved the melee damage on pets focused by Ritual Summoning. <br>
    <br>
    - The magician epic pet can now Enrage when focused by Minion of Darkness.
    <br>
    <br>
    - Increased the offensive capabilities of most pets when focused by 
    Summoner's Boon. <br>
    <br>
    - We have removed the Stamina effects from many spells. <br>
    <br>
    - Fixed a bug that would cause issues with pet hit points, and could cause 
    them to be unable to move if their hit points got too low. This may also 
    address other issues with pets using hit-point boosting items. <br>
    <br>
    ** Alternate Advancement ** <br>
    <br>
    - Extended Notes 3 and Sionachie's Cresendo have been refunded. If you had 
    these bard AAs and were close to 30 AA points stored, make certain that you 
    spend enough points to have 30 or less unspent AA points before you zone. 
    All AA points over 30 are removed when you zone. You may, of course, 
    repurchase these AAs. <br>
    <br>
    - Extended Notes and Sionachie's Cresendo no longer affects harmful 
    area-of-effect spells. <br>
    <br>
    - Jamfest has been fixed. It will now affect the bard's group, not just the 
    bard. <br>
    <br>
    - The Archetype AA ability Spell Casting Deftness was not reducing the 
    casting time for the wizard spell Harvest. It does now. <br>
    <br>
    ** Tradeskills ** <br>
    <br>
    - Merchants will not pay more for a tradeskill product than the cost of the 
    components needed to make it. However, they will still sell those products 
    for the same amount. <br>
    <br>
    ** Zones and Quests ** <br>
    <br>
    - Maelin will now respond as though you have the Quintessence, as long as 
    you are flagged for time. It is also now possible to receive any of the 
    earlier progression flags, even if you have already earned access to the 
    Plane of Time. <br>
    <br>
    ** User Interface ** <br>
    <br>
    - Tell windows now log the name of the person sending tells in the chat log.
    <br>
    <br>
    - Tell windows now blink when a tell is received, even when the window is 
    not minimized. <br>
    <br>
    - Fixed a problem that caused users some ATI cards to be unable to see the 
    /find path or the targeting ring. <br>
    <br>
    - We have added a new combat ability windown which allows you to make up to 
    eight hot keys for disciplines and other new melee abilities and displays 
    any current melee effects. The window can be opened by pressing Alt+C. The 
    keys are accessible using either the mouse or Ctrl+1-8. <br>
    <br>
    ** Miscellaneous ** <br>
    <br>
    - Added some explanation text to the targetindicator.ini file that help 
    explain how to modify the targeting ring.</font></p>

    <font face="Arial">Good news for Kerasota (gotta love when you can make some

    <p align="left">
    <font face="Arial">How will this effect the views of Lucy?&nbsp; Supposedly 
    nothing much will change.&nbsp; According to Allakhazam's, the only real 
    change a non supporter will see is no more Lucy specific forums, and you 
    won't be able to do advanced searches without being an Allakhazam's 
    subscriber.&nbsp; So the future looks decent there.</font></p>
