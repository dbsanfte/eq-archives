        I don't know anything about these folks, but thought you all might enjoy 
        knowing about it :)<p>Announcing the Twilight Exchange! <br>
        <br>
        For those who have been working on the Twilight Sea quests, with the
        5 zones and hundreds of rare quest mobs &amp; drops, I have started an
        ezboard dedicated to being a pan-server marketplace and discussion
        area for the quests. The idea is that most people will end up with
        more unneeded drops than needed, so the board is there to make it easy
        to arrange trades with people that have what you need and need what
        you have. <br>
        <br>
        There is a board for each server, plus areas for discussing the
        quests. Of course, it will only work if people use it, so I'm trying
        to get the word out to as many Everquest sites as possible. Please,
        if you are working on the quests and want to make trades of drops,
        come to The Twilight Exchange and post what you've got, and what you
        want! <br>

            <font face="Verdana" size="2">(11/27/2001 Denver, 
            Colorado) – Today, GuildPortal, an online community host for players 
            of Massively Multiplayer Online Games, announced the nearing of 300 
            hosted guilds and player associations supporting over 2200 users.</font></div>

            <font face="Verdana" size="2">“This shows the 
            viability of the underlying GuildPortal engine,” said Aaron Lewis, 
            developer of the GuildPortal service.&nbsp; “The performance has stayed 
            consistent througout the increase in the number of users 
            concurrently accessing the site, keeping each guild’s portal at 
            least as fast as most single-guild hosted solutions.” </font>

          <div>

            forums, voting, events scheduling/notification, member rosters, news 
            feeds specific to the game a guild plays, chat and an integrated 
            e-mail service.&nbsp; Boasting over 30 different ways to customize the 
            appearance of a guild’s page, GuildPortal claims to be at the top of 
            their game – and yours.&nbsp; “It’s not just fluff, either.&nbsp; If you go 
            check out the options for customization on forum solutions, you’ll 
            see that most if it is filler.&nbsp; It exists solely for the purpose of 
            having something to list in the bi-weekly release notes.&nbsp; 
            GuildPortal really offers you a full solution,” said Lewis.</font></div>

            “Right now, GuildPortal is working on putting together a package of 
            Web Services based on the .NET platform.&nbsp; Once that’s done, we hope 
            to be able to work out arrangements with game publishers so that 
            their systems can talk to ours in near real-time.&nbsp; For example, if 
            you create a guild in, say, EverQuest, our web services could accept 
            information from Verant’s servers, automatically creating your 
            guild’s web presence for you.&nbsp; Now, we haven’t spoken to any game 
            publishers yet about this, as we want to get a working framework in 
            place before we do.&nbsp; But it’s something we’re really very excited 
            about.”</font></div>

          Third party programs are strictly forbidden fom EQ! I am organizing a

          the use of 3rd party programs. I hope you confident that EQwatcher is 
          an approved program to use while running EQ. You have been reported 
          and will continue to be reported on a daily basis till we have
