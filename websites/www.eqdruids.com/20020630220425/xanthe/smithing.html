<p><img src="smithfile.jpg" align="left" width="50" height="49"> Smithing is the very first trade skill that I took up, and aside from Tailoring, is the one that took me the longest to get to where I am now. I originally started Smithing, because I dreamed of making wonderful suits of armour for my characters to wear. There’s almost nothing that will give you more pride than finally donning a shiny new piece of armour that you have crafted at the forge with your own bare hands. Unfortunately, I’m a druid, so that idea kind of went out of the window when I discovered I can’t wear it. Still, you do get a nice tingly feeling when you polish up your first piece of Fine Steel Plate:)</p><br>

When starting your career in Smithing it is handy to know beforehand that if you are serious about getting to the level where you can reliably make armour, you are going to spend a lot of money. At least 2000pp I would estimate, but it’s been ages since I last did any Smithing. And that’s only to the Banded Armour stage.<p><br>

<b><u><font size=+1>Where to Smith</font></b></u><p><br>

<p><img src="smithfile.jpg" align="left" width="50" height="49"> I personally do all of my Smithing in Freeport. It has everything you will need in order Smith, and there are at least 2 forges in each zone. For those of you who have never seen a forge before, <a href="forge.jpg">this is what it looks like.</a> If it is at all possible, I would ship yourself over to Freeport and start there. Ore is bought at Groflah’s Forge in North Freeport, near the Bard’s Guild, water can be bought all over, and molds and sheet metal are found in East Freeport.</p>

Ore can also be bought in Highpass, but I get lost there extremely badly, and never actually found the city itself at all. I did however find a lot of gnolls and orcs who wanted very badly to skin me alive and use my hide as a throw rug. Still, I was younger then, and if you are still in your 20’s I’d avoid trying to run the gauntlet through that maze to find the city. Go to Freeport instead. Erudin also sells ore, but Erudin is miles out of the way of anywhere, and I do not recall the range of molds that they sell (molds are important).<p>

Evil races should be able to do their Smithing in Neriak, although I am not sure again as to the availability of molds, and I am not too familiar with how friendly Dark Elves are to others. Ogres can get in, if I recall, but I wouldn’t push it if I were anyone else without knowing for sure.<p>

It is worth mentioning that apparently a higher Strength will give your character more chance of success in Smithing, so if you have any strength gear, you might want to put it on, or get a buff.<p>

If you have practise points to spare (from your Guild Master) you may want to put in the full 21. It will save you a fair bit of time and frustration, and a bit of money too. 21 is the maximum amount of points you can put into any trade skill.<p><br>

<b><u><font size=+1>Starting Smithing</font></b></u><p><br>

<p><img src="smithfile.jpg" align="left" width="50" height="49"> In this particular guide, I shall be going into a little more detail on each step than I have in the other guides. To begin with there is the regular table showing the route that I took. After the table is an in depth step by step analysis of the route. I shall assume that you are in Freeport.</p><br>

Ok then, to begin with, go buy yourself a whole bunch of Small Pieces of Ore (the stackable bits). No, more than that…Keep going…<p>
Ok, that’ll do. Now go buy some water. For every 2 stacks of Ore that you have, you will need one stack of water. Also, make sure that you leave one or two slots free in your bags somewhere to put the results of what you will be making. Now go find a forge.<p><br>

<img src="forgeopen.jpg" width="119" height="389"><p><br>

As always, NEVER stack items in the combining container, and NEVER use Summoned or Foraged water, it just won’t work.<p><br>

<b>Item 1</b><p><br>

The first thing you will be making will be (drumroll)…..Metal Bits! Over the time it takes you to become a master Smith, and beyond, you will very likely learn to hate Metal Bits with every fibre of your being. They are, however, a necessary evil and must be tolerated.<p>

To make a Metal Bit, place 2 Small Pieces of Ore (separate) and 1 water into the forge, and press combine. If you are successful, you will be rewarded with bane of your life. If you are unsuccessful, everything will disappear.<br>
Metal Bits go trivial at 21, so if you maxed out your guild training, you shouldn’t have too much trouble with these. Now, go make lots more of these. You will need them for the next stages.<p><br>

<b>Item 2</b><p><br>

Tool Boxes. These are really easy to make. Place 1 Metal Bit and 1 water into the forge and press combine. Voila, a tool box. This is a container, so you will need to have a main inventory slot free. Go sell these as you make them. Tedious I know, but still… These trivial at 51.<p>

<b>***Scalers:</b> It has been noted that scalers are a also a good means of skilling up to 41, as they will fit into bags, whereas toolboxes will not. You may wish to make scalers up to 41, then either move on to toll boxes, or skip them entirely.
<p><br>

<b>Item 3</b><p><br>

Lanterns. These are slightly more complicated, and once again you will need more Metal Bits. Place 1 Metal Bit, 1 water, 1 Bottle, and one Lantern Casing Mold into the forge and press combine. These will fit inside bags, and you can either sell them back to the vendor, or sell them to players as a light source. They trivial at 68.<p><br>

<b>Item 4</b><p><br>

Skewers. I am not going to go into the detail of how much I hate skewers. Make them yourself until they are trivial, and you shall come to understand my dislike of them. Easy enough to make though, 1 Metal Bit, 1 water, and 1 Skewer Mold in the forge. They trivial at 115. Have fun:)<p><br>

<b>Item 5</b><p><br>

At this point, you could have a stab at making the easier pieces of banded armour if you wanted to. However, banded pieces cost around 2 or 3 pp each to make even for the simpler items, so if your skill is still only around the 115 mark you may start to lose a fair bit of money from failures. I raised my skill to 135 before trying any banded, and I did that by making Sewing Kits.<p>

For this you will need to place 1 Metal Bit, 1 water, 1 Thimble Mold, and 1 Needle Mold into the forge and press combine. The molds for this are usually not found on the regular mold vendor, and will be elsewhere, sometimes on a tailoring vendor. The one nearest Freeport that sells the molds is Spoolie Gee (poor bloke), the tailoring vendor at the Inn in North Ro.<p>

The resulting Sewing Kit is a container, so you will need to have a main inventory slot free, and sell them as you make them. Once they are trivial, you should be ok to make the 1 sheet banded armour items (collar, boots, bracer).<p><br>

<b>Item 6</b><p><br>

No more metal bits! Yippee! Take a moment to celebrate, as now you will never have to make another metal bit unless you really want to:) You are now ready to move on to banded mantles.<p>

For banded armour, you need Metal Sheets, and the appropriate armour mold, as well as the regular water. These things can all be found in East Freeport, along with a couple of forges. The shop you are looking for is Armour by Ikthar. The woman who is downstairs sells both the sheets, and the molds.<p>

For each mantle you will place 2 Metal Sheets, 1 water and 1 Mantle Mold into the forge and press combine. You are still a way away from the trivial for these (168), so don’t be too surprised if you fail on a few of them. The ones you do make can either be sold back to the vendor, which will get you a good portion of your money back, or you can sell them to players.<p>

Most people charge 1pp for every point of armour class (AC) on a piece of banded armour. For instance, the AC on a banded mantle is 6, so you would charge 6pp for it. Of course, what you actually charge is up to you, and if you want to shift them quick, you might charge a lot less.<p><br>

<b>Item 7</b><p><br>

Banded Cloaks. This is the last type of banded armour you will be making, and it trivials 175. The recipe is 2 Metal Sheets, 1 water and 1 Cloak Mold.<p><br>


<b><u>Fine Steel Plate</b></u><p><br>

Congratulations! You have now trivialed every piece of banded armour! You are now ready to make Fine Steel Plate! This is where Smithing starts to get a lot more expensive.<p>

There are 5 elements to combine when making Fine Steel Plate:<p>

<b>*</b>Medium Quality Folded Sheets of Metal<p>

<b>*</b>Plate Armour Mold<p>

<b>*</b>Smithy Hammer<p>

<b>*</b>Leather Padding<p>

<b>*</b>Water<p><br>


As far as I am aware Folded Medium Quality sheets cannot be bought anywhere, and must be made. Only a few places in Norrath sell the Medium Quality Ore. Highpass Hold is one place, and another is the Windmills in the newbie zone of Steamfont (near the gnome city of Ak Anon).<p>

Being a druid, I find it a lot easier than most people to get my ore, as I can bind myself at a forge in Freeport, then port myself to the Steamfont druid ring, buy the ore and gate back to the forge. If you are not a druid, you might wish to move to Highpass for making Fine Steel Plate (unless you are ok with gnomes), although I am not sure if they stock the correct molds.<p><br>

Once you have your Medium Quality Ore, you will need to fashion it into folded sheets. To make a folded sheet there are 2 steps.<p>

<b>Step 1 –</b> Combine 3 Large Bricks of Medium Quality Ore and 1 water in the forge. This makes a Block of Medium Quality Ore.<p>

<b>Step 2 –</b> Combine the Block that you made in step 1 with 1 water AND your Smithy Hammer. If you are successful you will receive a Medium Quality Folded Sheet of Metal. Whether you are successful or not, your hammer will be returned to you.<p><br>


Plate armour molds can be bought in several cities, and if you are in Freeport then you will need to go back to Armour by Ikthar in East Freeport. The woman that sells the plate molds is upstairs. Plate molds are a lot more expensive than banded molds. I think some of the more complex molds cost in the region of 20 or 30pp each.<p><br>

Smithy Hammers are generally sold by the ore vendor, and in Freeport, this means Groflah’s Forge in North Freeport. You can buy one for around 10pp.<p><br>

Leather Padding is made by Tailors. If you cannot find a tailor to buy some from, you can try to make your own. The recipe is 1 Low Quality Pelt (wolf, cat or bear) and 1 Silk Thread combined in a Sewing Kit. Leather Padding trivials at 31, so you can quickly become self sufficient.<p><br>

My current skill at Smithing is 168. I have in the past made several pieces of Fine Plate, including 2 full suits, although I had quite a few failures on the 2 sheet items. I plan to get my skill up to 200 by first making collars, and then bracers, as they only require 1 sheet of metal each. Collars trivial at 182, and bracers between 195 and 208 (so I’m imagining that the trivial is actually over the 200 mark).<p><br>

<b>To make a Collar</b> you need to place into the forge 1 Medium Quality Folded Sheet of Metal, 1 Plate Gorget Mold, 1 Leather Padding, 1 Smithy Hammer, and 1 water.<p><br>

<b>Bracers</b> take 1 Medium Quality Folded Sheet of Metal, 1 Plate Bracer Mold, 1 Leather Padding, 1 Smithy Hammer, and 1 water.<p><br>

Once these are trivial, you will be a Grand Master Smith! Here is a picture of the first full set of Fine Steel Plate that I made, modelled by a friend <a href="plate1.jpg">pic</a>.Other pieces of Fine Steel Plate will take you higher than that, and then there are the Cultural items. Once you get that far, you can be very proud of yourself as you are now one of the skill’s elites!<p><br>
