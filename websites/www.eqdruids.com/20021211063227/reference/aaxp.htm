These are additional ways for your character to be able to increase skills or add new skills in certain areas.<br> <br> To access the Alternate Advancement options, hit V or push the Alternate button on your inventory window (if higher than 640x480 resolution).<br> <br> First thing you need to do once you decide to start working on your alternate advancements is how much of your experience do you want to go into alternate advancements (AA).<br> <br> There is a slider labeled Exp. Going To Special Abilities: There will be a number between the two arrows. This number is how much experience is going into your AA. If the number is 10, 10% of your experience is going into AA. If the number is 100, 100% of your experience is going into AA. You can change this percentage at anytime. You are not locking yourself into a percentage by choosing a number. You might want to vary how much goes into AA depending on where you are etc.<br> <br> You continue to gain experience in AA until you have 5 yellow bubbles of experience (similar to leveling). When you have finished a level of AA, the Train button will become useable. Dying will not reduce the amount of experience you have gained in the AA advancement. You will however still lose experience from your level. <br> <br> To train in an AA, you choose the AA, and push the train button. It’s that simple. Then you will show the number of points you have trained in that AA.<br> <br> When you have trained in 6 points you will be known as Baron/Baroness. 18 points you will be known as Venerable. 42 points trained and you will be known as Elder.<br> <br> <a name="Level 51 Abilities - General Alternate Abilities">Level 51 Abilities - General Alternate Abilities</a><br> <br> The level 51 General Alternate Abilities are:<br> <br> Innate Strength - 5 points can be trained in this skill, each point raises your strength by 2 points permanently.<br> <br> Innate Stamina - 5 points can be trained in this skill, each point raises your stamina by 2 points permanently.<br> <br> Innate Agility - 5 points can be trained in this skill, each point raises your agility by 2 points permanently.<br> <br> Innate Dexterity - 5 points can be trained in this skill, each point raises your dexterity by 2 points permanently.<br> <br> Innate Intelligence - 5 points can be trained in this skill, each point raises your Intelligence by 2 points permanently.<br> <br> Innate Wisdom - 5 points can be trained in this skill, each point raises your wisdom by 2 points permanently.<br> <br> Innate Charisma - 5 points can be trained in this skill, each point raises your charisma by 2 points permanently.<br> <br> Innate Fire Protection - 5 points can be trained in this skill, each point raises your Save vs. Fire by 2 points permanently.<br> <br> Innate Cold Protection - 5 points can be trained in this skill, each point raises your Save vs. Cold by 2 points permanently.<br> <br> Innate Magic Protection - 5 points can be trained in this skill, each point raises your Save vs. Magic by 2 points permanently.<br> <br> Innate Poison Protection - 5 points can be trained in this skill, each point raises your Save vs. Poison by 2 points permanently.<br> <br> Innate Disease Protection - 5 points can be trained in this skill, each point raises your Save vs. Disease by 2 points permanently.<br> <br> Innate Run Speed - 3 points can be trained in this skill, each point raises your unbuffed run speed (i.e. no sow, no spirit of scale etc).<br> <br> Innate Regeneration - 3 points can be trained in this skill, each point raises your regeneration level (faster health regeneration).<br> <br> Innate Metabolism - 3 points can be trained in this skill. One point trained will reduce your food/water consumption by 10%. Two points will reduce your consumption by 25%, and three points will reduce your consumption by 50%.<br> <br> Innate Lung Capacity - 3 points can be trained in this skill. One point trained will increase the amount of air you have when swimming/in airless areas by 10%. Two points will increase your air by 25%, 3 points will give you 50% more air.<br> <br> First Aid - 3 points can be trained in this skill. Each point you train increases how far you can bandage someone’s health. The base is 50%. Train one point, you can now bandage someone to 60% health. Two points, 70% health. Three points 80% health.<br> <br> That is the level 51 abilities. All are trainable after level 51.<br> <br> Level 55 Abilities - Archetype Abilities<br> <br> At level 55 you can now train in the Archetype abilities. You cannot train in these abilities until you have two things accomplished. You must be level 55 or higher, and you must have trained 6 points into your general abilities.<br> <br> <a name="The level 55 Archetype Abilities are:">The level 55 Archetype Abilities are:</a><br> <br> Healing Adept - 3 points can be trained in this ability. Each point of training costs 2 ability points. One point trained will increase the maximum effectiveness of your healing spells by 2%. Two points will increase the effectiveness by 5%, three points will increase the effectiveness by 10%. So if you train 3 points, with a normal healing spell of 400 hps, you will now heal up to 440 hps.<br> <br> Healing Gift - 3 points can be trained in this ability. Each point of training costs 2 ability points. One point of training will increase your chance of a Critical Heal by 3%. A Critical Heal means the amount of hitpoints you heal doubles. Two points of training increases your chance by 6%, three points increase you chance by 10%. So if you cast a healing spell that would normally heal 400 hitpoints, and you roll a Critical Heal, your healing spell will heal 800 hitpoints on that cast only.<br> <br> Spell Casting Mastery - 3 points can be trained in this ability. Each point of training costs 2 ability points. This ability has 3 affects. It increases your chance of a Specialization check, lowers your chance of fizzling a spell, and reduces the amount of mana used to cast that spell. One point of training increases your chance 5% of activating this ability, two points of training 15%, and three points of training 30%.<br> <br> Spell Casting Reinforcement - 3 points can be trained in this ability. Each point of training costs 2 ability points. This ability is very simple. Each point of training increases the length of your beneficial spells (e.g. chloroplast, sow, storm strength etc). One point of training increases the duration of your spell by 5%, two points of training increases the duration by 15%, and three points of training increases the duration by 30%.<br> <br> Mental Clarity - 3 points can be trained in this ability. Each point of training costs 2 ability points. This ability raises your natural mana regeneration by 1 point for each point you train. You can increase your natural mana regeneration by 3 points total.<br> <br> Spell Casting Fury - 3 points can be trained in this ability. Each point of training costs 2 ability points. This ability gives you a chance of hitting a critical hit with a direct damage spell. For one point of training you increase your chance by 2%, two points of training you increase your chance by 4%, and three points of training you increase your chance by 7%. This includes direct damage effects from items.<br> <br> Channeling Focus - 3 points can be trained in this ability. Each point of training costs 2 ability points. This ability decreases the chance of your spell being interrupted. If your spell was going to be interrupted, training one point decreases your chance by 5%, two points decreases your chance by 10%, and three points decreases your chance by 15%.<br> <br> That is all the level 55 Archetype Abilities.<br> <br> <a name="Level 59 Abilities - Class Abilities">Level 59 Abilities - Class Abilities</a><br> <br> To train in your Class Abilities you must have done two things. You must be level 59 or 60, and you must have trained 12 ability points in your Archetype Abilities.<br> <br> Mass Group Buff - This ability takes 9 points to train in. This ability does the following. If you are casting a group buff, the next time you cast that same buff, the buff will become an area affect spell buffing anyone within its range. The downfall is the mana cost for the buff doubles. So if you were casting Group Skin Like Nature, your next cast you could buff everyone within your range, instead of just your group.<br> <br> Quick Evacuation - 3 points can be trained in this ability. Each point of training takes 3 ability points. This ability reduces the time it takes to cast an Evac or egress/succor. One point of training reduces your cast time by 10%, two points reduces your cast time by 25%, and three points reduces your cast time by 50%.<br> <br> Exodus - This ability takes 6 ability points to train in. This ability allows you to cast an instant, no mana evacuation. The Evac will take you to the safe spot in the zone e.g. same spot egress/succor takes you. There is a 72 real world minute recharge between uses (not game time mins).<br> <br> Quick Damage - 3 points can be trained in this ability. Each point of training takes 3 ability points. This ability reduces the amount of casting time from your damage spell. The damage spells casting time must be over 4 seconds (pre ability boost) before this ability will take affect. One point of training will decrease your casting time by 2%, two points of training will decrease your casting time by 5% and three points of training will decrease your casting time by 10%.<br> <br> Enhanced Root - This ability takes 5 ability points to train. Once you have trained in this ability your root will have a 50% less chance of breaking, if you cast a damage spell on a rooted mob.<br> <br> Dire Charm - This ability takes 9 ability points to train. This ability will allow you to permanently charm a level 48 or lower animal. There is no spell duration to this charm. If you use this ability there is a 72-minute refresh time before it can be used again. This includes if you attempt to charm an animal higher than level 48.<br> <br> Innate Camouflage - This ability takes 5 ability points to train. This ability will allow you to become invisible without casting a spell. There is a 7 second refresh on this ability.<br> <br> Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery - This ability takes 8 ability points to train in. This ability is simple. It increases the duration of your buffs by 20%.<br> <br> Now for the question on what should you train in. This is going to be a bit personal depending on what type of role you normally play in Everquest. A person that mainly solos is going to want to train differently than someone that groups mostly. I'm going to put out my ideas on things and you can use that for guidance if you like.<br> <br> I would personally start with increasing Wisdom. Now with the mana cap removed, more wisdom means more mana. Also more Innate wisdom allows you to trade out Wis gear for resist gear. A nice bonus at higher levels.<br> <br> I would also consider Innate Run Speed and Innate Regeneration. <br> <br> I probably would not train in the resists (easy to get + resist gear). I also probably would not train in things like Innate Metabolism because of foraging. First Aid would depend on if I normally band aided folks. If you carry bandages for when you are OOM, then this would be a good ability to train in. I personally just heal myself.<br> <br> Now the Archetypes.<br> <br> Here again it will depend on your normal role within EQ. <br> <br> I would train in Mental Clarity first (faster mana always a good thing). Then Spell Casting Reinforcement (longer a buff lasts, more mana I have). And then either Healing Gift, or Spell Casting Fury.<br> <br> I wouldn't probably train in Channeling Focus (I'm not interrupted that often now). I also probably wouldn't train in Healing Adept. 10% increase isn't much for the amount of time, and the level of druid healing.<br> <br> Now for the Class Abilities.<br> <br> I would train first in Dire Charm. I use pets when soloing and having a pet that would not break free at a bad time is a great idea to me. Then Enhanced Root. I tend to solo, so not breaking my root would be a benefit. Last probably Innate Camouflage. If I were a grouping person, I would definitely train in Mass Group Buff and Quick Evacuation/Exodus.<br> <br> Remember when you are looking at these abilities that they do not come quickly! To start on your Class abilities you must have used up 18 points of ability points minimum. This is the same as leveling to fifty-one, eighteen times!</font></p><p><font face=Arial><a href=../index.html>Return to Main</a></font><br> &nbsp;</p></td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr></table><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td><p align=center style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size=1>All information contained on this website copyright Thistlethorne Enterprises 2001-2002.&nbsp; Everquest copyright Sony Inc.</font></p></td></tr></table><!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table><!--msnavigation--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td><p align=center style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size=1>All information contained on this website copyright Thistlethorne Enterprises 2001-2002.&nbsp; Everquest copyright Sony Inc.</font></p></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table></body></html>
