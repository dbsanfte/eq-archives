<b>Everyone who does tradeskills as a major part of their gaming life eventually comes to think of themselves as a practitioner of one particular skill above all others. The dedication and determination it takes to raise one's skill over the 200 mark and become a Grandmaster is immense, but your efforts and pride in your skill will often go unnoticed, except by close friends. As part of the HUGE set of tradeskill patches in the middle of 2002, it is now possible to craft an item to show your surpassing and consumate skill in your chosen trade, and to aid you in your crafting of further wonders.</b><p><br>

Each tradeskill has its own Tradeskill Trophy, to mark you as an elite in your field. Each trophy has exactly the same stats (Str 10, Cha 50, Int 10, Wis 10), differing only by name. They are Lore, No Drop and will equip in Primary, Secondary, Range or Ammo (stats only take effect in prim, sec, range, so Ammo slot is just for showing off:) Each one adds 5% to that particular skill, and also summons a No Rent, No Drop, 10 slot 100% weight reduction Grandmaster's Satchel. At this time it is unknown whether you must have reached 201 or more skill in order to make these, but they trivial at over 250, so it is unlikely that you will see an unskilled person with one of these.<p><br>

<b><u><font size=+2>Making your Trophy</b></u></font><p><br>

There are two steps to making a Grandmaster's Trophy. Firstly, an Artisan's Seal must be crafted, using a combination of pottery and jewelcraft. This item is tradeable, so if you are not skilled in this, you can buy it from somebody who is. The second step is to combine the seal with an item of your trade, to make the trophy. This item differs depending on your trade, naturally.<p><br>
