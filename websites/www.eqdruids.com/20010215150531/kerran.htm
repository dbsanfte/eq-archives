  <b><font color="#ff0000">Feskr's Supplies:</font>&nbsp; hail Feskr Drinkmaker
  and he says 'Erh?&nbsp; If you not be here to help Feskr with his [problem]
  then Feskr wants you to leave. Say, 'what problem?' and he says 'You wish to
  help?&nbsp; Orrderrr of supplies I order not arrive, ship sink.&nbsp; Now
  Feskr needs supplies.&nbsp; Feskr need bottle of Tunares Finest (buy in
  Felwithe), Thunderhoof Mushroom (forage in SK), Tea Leaf (forage in EK), and
  Handmade Backpack (tailoring skill).&nbsp; Rrrr, strange items but Feskr need
  to sell.&nbsp; You bring Feskr give you nice bag.&quot;&nbsp; Give him the
  items and you get the <a href="images/roughleathersack.jpg">rough leather sack</a>,
  a weight reducing backpack. (30 percent reduction)</b>
  <p><b><font color="#ff0000">Fish Dinner:</font>&nbsp; Roary Fishcatcher,&nbsp;
  in the hut immediately to your right upon entering Kerra Isle, is an excellent
  chef and loves to prepare different types of fish.&nbsp; He wishes you to
  venture to Nektulos Forest to hunt the Darkwater Pirhanna and return it to him
  for a reward.&nbsp; The fish swim in the Nektulos Forest River (they are a
  very rare spawn) and sometimes drop a Raw Darkwater Piranha Fish when killed.&nbsp;
  Bring back this delicacy and your reward is a <a href="images/KerranFishingSpear.jpg">Kerran
  Fishing Spear</a>.</b>
  <p><b><font color="#ff0000">Gnomish Toy:</font>&nbsp; The Kerra Iseqs are
  children who beg you to bring them a gnomish toy. There is a clockwork in
  Steamfont called Nilit's Clockwork which spawns near the mino cave and drops a
  gnome tinkered toy.&nbsp; This is likely what is needed for this quest.&nbsp;
  Your reward is a <a href="images/kerratoy.jpg">Kerran Toy</a>, which goes in
  the ranged slot.</b>
  <p><b><font color="#ff0000">Health Potion:</font>&nbsp; Errak Thickshank has a
  sick friend and needs the ingredients to make a potion to cure her.&nbsp;
  Bring her a giant snake fang, an Aviak Charm, and a Tiger Skin not&nbsp; from
  Kerra Isle.&nbsp; Your reward is a <a href="images/bonetalisman.jpg">Bone
  Talisman</a>, which goes in the off hand.</b>
  <p><b><font color="#ff0000">The Luck of Allix:</font>&nbsp; Allix feels that
  in order to be a bettter warrior, he needs a good luck charm.&nbsp; He asks
  you to venture to Eastern Karanas and bring him back an Arjah Leaf from a tree
  there.&nbsp; I assume you have to kill a treant to get this.&nbsp; I don't
  know the reward for this.</b>
  <p><b><font color="#ff0000">Rat Teeth:</font>&nbsp; Kill wharf rats that spawn
  in the warehouse near the docks and collect their teeth (not the ones in the
  water).&nbsp; Turn them in to Thalith Mamluk, who stands by the docks, for a <a href="images/fishbonenecklace.jpg">fishbone
  necklace</a>.</b>
  <p><b><font color="#ff0000">Razortooth:</font>&nbsp; You can find Feren on a
  boat in the wharf, fishing.&nbsp; He says he enjoys fishing but is forever
  haunted by a vicious fish named Razortooth that continues to nibble at his
  boat and eat his catch.&nbsp; He says he will reward you if you kill him and
  return the remains.&nbsp; The fish is a very rare spawn.&nbsp; Your reward for
  this is a fishing pole (1HB, 3/17).&nbsp; It seems likely that the pole is
  needed for another quest somewhere.</b>
  <p><b><font color="#ff0000">Shiny Rings:</font>&nbsp; This is to get the rings
  for the Paw of Opolla Quest.&nbsp; Melixis is a merchant that sells supplies
  for shaman-made potions.&nbsp; When you hail her she claims to have three
  [shiny tings] that she found all over the world.&nbsp; These shiny tings are
  [a dull ring] (the copper ring) a [kinda shiny ring] (the silver ring ) and a
  [really shiny ring] (the gold ring).&nbsp; For the dull ring she wants a
  bracket mildew, which drops off of the Fungus Mutant in Upper Guk.&nbsp; For
  the kinda shiny ring she wants faerix spores, which drop off the Mutant
  Fungus.&nbsp; And for the really shiny
  ring she wants degenerated guk weed, which also drops off the Fungus Mutant
  in Upper Guk.</b></p>
  <div style="width: 592; height: 19">
    <b><font size="2">T</font><font size="3">he platinum ring drops from Gynok
    (STILL the only way to get it)</font></b>
  </div>
  <div>
    <b><font size="3">The gold ring is the reward for bringing the degenerated
    guk weed (Mutant Fungus in Uguk) to Melixis.</font></b>
  </div>
  <div>
    <b><font size="3">The silver ring is the reward for bringing the Faerix
    Spores (Mutant Fungus in Uguk) to Melixis.</font></b>
  </div>
  <div>
    <b><font size="3">The copper ring is the reward for bringing the Bracket Guk
    Mildew (Mutant Fungus in Uguk)&nbsp; to Melixis.</font></b>
  </div>
  <p><b><font color="#ff0000">Silvani Leaf:</font>&nbsp; Urkath wants you to
  bring him a silvani leaf, which are rumored to drop from brownies in Lesser
  Faydark.&nbsp; Thisdrops from Ivey Bramblefoot in lesser faydark, who has a
  placeholder.&nbsp; The actual spawn point is somewhere south of the pixie
  tower (the loc escapes me) but can be found as follows.&nbsp; On the west wall
  of the zone near the south corner there is a 'valley'.&nbsp; near the north
  end of this valley you can find an Orc Centurion stuck in place turning in
  circles.&nbsp; He is the placeholder.&nbsp; Kill him and every 6 or so minutes
  he will come back.&nbsp; Each time you kill him you can watch him approaching
  and track him northeast a bit to a small hillside, then east a bit to his
  spawn point.&nbsp; After I found the placeholder it took me about 30 minutes
  to get to the spawn point and about 6 hours of killing the orc to make him
  spawn.&nbsp; The orc is about level 10, Ivey is a level 20 druid.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The reward is Worn Leather Shoulderpads, which are 4ac +4str.&nbsp;</b>
  <p><b><font color="#ff0000">Test of Kejaar:</font>&nbsp; There is a Kerran
  named Shazad Asad who tells you that you can prove yourself a Kejaar by
  helping destroy their Erudite enemies.&nbsp; He first wants you to destroy the
  Erudite Emissary (approx level 20).&nbsp; The emissary runs around Tox Forest.&nbsp;
  Kill him and bring back his head for a <a href="images/kejaar.jpg">Kejaar
  Totem</a> .&nbsp; You will then be told to to kill their most hated foe,
  Sentinel Creot (approx level 30), a roaming guard in Tox Forest.&nbsp; If you
  kill him and return his head you will become a full Sejah warrior, and receive
  the reward of a <a href="images/sejahghulambracer.gif">Sejah Ghulam Bracer</a>.</b>
