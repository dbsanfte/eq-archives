We believe that the crates he carries are supplies needed for the creation of more Ghasts. Another shipment should be arriving soon. Seek out the necromancer at the obelisk and take his head then take the head of the courier and return them to me with the crate that the courier carries and your Initiate Symbol of Tunare. <br> <br> The courier is making deliveries to the Teir'Dal camp near Castle Mistmoore and to a necromancer that lingers near the ancient obelisk.

  Larik can take some time to spawn, so be prepared.&nbsp; There will be two 
  undead creatures that spawn on the Obelisk, one at the top near the Obelisk

  He can only spawn at night also.</font></p>

  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Arial">I found 
  it worked best to stay bound near the Obelisk, and when game time was getting 
  close to night I would gate back over and start killing the undead in the

  spawn.</font></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>

  you kill Larik you will spawn the Dark Elf Courier.&nbsp; The way I handled it 
  was simple.&nbsp; I looted Larik's head, then started to track the Priestess

  area to the Dark Elf camp.&nbsp; By running to the Dark Elf camp I was able to 
  get the courier on track and chase him down before he reached the camp.</font></p>
