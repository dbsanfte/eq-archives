Put on SLN, Thorns, Chloro. You set the druid to auto-follow while grouped with the<BR>enchanter and then disband the group -- you stay on auto-follow that way. Just leave the<BR>enchanter targeted and heal (with level 19 heal spell) if needed usually. Once in a while you<BR>may need to finish off a tough cleric orc or snare a runner or something. Enchanter just runs<BR>from camp to camp and tries to hit each orc once with their cheapest spell (shallow breath<BR>or ??) while the orcs kill themselves on the damage shield. <BR>Kresha Zauber <BR>Halfling Druidess of Prexus<BR><BR> <BR>holyhawk1<BR>Registered User<BR>(10/11/00 4:34:34 pm)<BR>Reply  I agree<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> I have to agree with Kresha there...plus the zone hardly ever has more than say 20 people in it (well on Povar at least).

Maybe I'll try it in the off hours some time and see if I have<BR>better luck.<BR><BR><BR>Kresha Zauber <BR>Halfling Druidess of Prexus<BR><BR> <BR>Glacius Mercykiller<BR>Registered User<BR>(10/16/00 11:27:20 am)<BR>Reply  Re: Best Power Leveling Location<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> Well i've PL'd many friends and guildmates secondaries plenty o' times. Heres how I do it and best locations I've found. Also: up to lvl 35 make sure the person your powerlevelling gets at least 1 hit in on each mob. Always keep 4-5 mobs on him at once. If it is a caster with an AE available even better as he can hit them all (same with PLing a bard)<BR><BR>lvl 1-5 East commons (bears, beetles, snakes etc)<BR>lvl 5-14 Unrest. Yard trash. (these levels FLY)<BR>lvl 14-17 Derv Camp in WC. Pull the entire camp (lol).<BR>lvl 17-25 Mistmoore out by the pond.<BR>lvl 25-35 Upper Guk. Scryer room.<BR>lvl 35-40 * Infected Paw dungeon. Group with them and kill everything. You get no exp, they get hella exp. This will only work if you are lvl 50 or so. Any higher and they don't get exp.<BR>lvl 40-51 Timorous Deep. Group with them and quad kite spirocs.<BR><BR>Well there ya go. Personally after lvl 25 it becomes a chore. So this person better be a good friend of yours.<BR><BR>Also, they should take time out every 4 levels and fight for a level on thier own to get the skills up.<BR><BR><BR>Power levelling spells up to 35 (before grouping) are:<BR>Buff them with Skin like Nature, Chloroplast, and Spikes damage shield. Heal as needed.<BR><BR>Hope this helps.<BR><BR>- Glacius<BR><BR> <BR>JustAnotherDruid<BR>Registered User<BR>(10/17/00 8:23:04 pm)<BR>Reply  Best Power Leveling Location<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> I think i like befallen, i mean there are sooo many mobs to kill and they respawan pretty quick, you can work on pickpocket skills, and there is always the chance of getting a plat ring.<BR><BR>JustAnotherDruid <BR> <BR>DrakeW<BR>Registered User<BR>(10/19/00 7:53:43 am)<BR>Reply  Re: Best Power Leveling Location<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> I would recommend SK like others mentioned for the lower lvls. Main reason? Nobody there and in the offchance of the AC spawning, you group and you REALLY just powerlvled the enchanter more then anything else. With JBoots he will be able to charm/solo from 12 on (with about 200pp worth of char items). <BR><BR>If nobody is hunting the AC you can just powerlvl him/her around the desert area trying to get the AC to pop. Works great! Only trouble is he/she might be over the lvl before the AC does show up, but worth powerlvling with many blues with the offchance of the JBoots <BR> <BR>Bartolo<BR>Registered User<BR>(10/20/00 12:56:29 pm)<BR>Reply  Unrest!<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> Unrest yard is an awesome place to PL from lvl 8 up. The exp will be great and the only problem will be that the caster has low ac, so will require heals a bit. A lvl 51 druid friend and I have been taking turns PL'ing each others alts and friends alts there. SLN+Chloro+thorns and the exp comes really fast.  <BR>Shadeaux<BR>Registered User<BR>(10/21/00 11:00:50 am)<BR>Reply  Re: Best Power Leveling Location<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> I took a lvl 10 Druid friend over to Kerra Isle...and he cleaned up on exp. I dmg. sheilded him, healed and snared and harmonied the mobs for him. It worked great!! <BR>Got him 3 lvls in about a day and 1/2. <BR><BR>The best part is...NO ONE ELSE WAS IN THE ZONE.!!! Hardly anyone EVER goes to that zone.<BR><BR>Errr but this was before they upped the mob lvls in Kerra, but I'm sure it will still work great.<BR><BR><BR>Shadeaux NightRaven<BR>Druid of the 9th.

Exp slowed down after that and it took 1.5 hrs to get to 14, hehe, Unrest is an awesome low level PowerLevel spot. It would be great up to around 30 if it didn't get so crowded. <BR> <BR>Tekkin51druid<BR>Registered User<BR>(10/25/00 9:27:10 am)<BR>Reply  plvlin place<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> I agree with everyone on all their posts, they are all great places to plvl. I just thought i would add that another great place to plvl from about 16-22 is in DC at the gobbie camp. EZ mobs, and its usually not that crowded, plus u have a chance at bilge spawning (PKT <BR>*Drool*). The gobbies spawn pretty fast, and the chloro can usually out do their dmg (meaning u heal faster than they deal dmg) although lvl 19 heal spell is necessary. If u r 54 and plvling them then it's even better cuz u got regrowth hehe. Then a great place from lvl's 22-30 is at the sarnaks in LOIO. Goto the castle, and go in like just past the entrance. It's never heaavily camped, and the mobs give xp up thru 31 if not higher. From then on, it gets harder to plvl and gets slower, so it's not as fun. If you want to grp from 31+ i suggest CT til 35, then Lower GUK spider room til 41, and then guk/solb/DL until 50. Karnors from 51-55, and depending on what class u r u can go solo in tim deep til 60. O btw, if u r a solo class u can solo from 40-54 with great xp off of the spirocs in tim deep.

It sucked.<BR><BR>beetles in karana kill themselves on shields, as well as mummy's in sro. not all undead kill themselves though. dry bones run as well.<BR><BR>so, any other mobs that kill themselves on shields?<BR><BR>regards,<BR><BR><BR> <BR>FemaleMonk  <BR>Registered User<BR>(10/27/00 11:01:47 am)<BR>Reply  Re: Best Power Leveling Location<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> Solve the problem by rooting the mob with the 5 damage root and it will kill itself off for you. <BR>Amenity Hundredblows<BR>57th Mistress on Rallos <BR> <BR>Phraynque<BR>Registered User<BR>(11/9/00 3:00:17 pm)<BR>Reply  Re: Best Power Leveling Location<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> Also consider using /assist, that way you can keep the lowbie targeted, hit assist to target and root the mob he's working on, then /assist again to retarget the player.<BR><BR>Toggling between views will also help you see and keep track of all the action and enable you to target and root the few that do get away. Then the lowbie can just walk over to that rooted one, get within meelee range and let it finish itself off.<BR><BR>Powerleveling is, in itself, a skill that must be practiced.

The worst part of PLing is when the mob starts to run. Sure, snare stops it, but it doesnt kill it. This leaves the poor newbie to finish off a mob he/she can barely hit, let alone nuke.

A lvl 29 clarity only increases mana regen by 2. It goes up to 7 by lvl 35 which is the max. It really wont take that much time to get him to lvl 35 and in the end result is definitly worth it.

Go in and get the mob in runmode, make sure it is ensnared and then zone leaving your apprenice in there to beat on it. When you come back in if the mob isn't dead, damage shield your buddy and then root the mob with the level 5 root spell. The mob will do itself in and your buddy will see some damn nice experience. Just make sure your friend has the HP's to handle the beatings while you cast heal. As soon as you will zone your friend will take at least one hit. There's also the chance of a reposte. <BR> <BR>Xashren<BR>Registered User<BR>(1/29/01 12:40:34 am)<BR>Reply <BR>  Re: Best Power Leveling Location<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> Can't let information like this go to waste. <BR><BR>/bump, for great justice ;P <BR> <BR>Blackwulf<BR>Registered User<BR>(1/29/01 8:03:37 pm)<BR>Reply <BR>  Re: Best Power Leveling Location<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> Working on PLing a friend of my partner, friend has 50s on another server but they want to group on BB.<BR><BR>_Great, ungodly exp can be found in the back corridors of Permafrost. Go to the Archaelogist's area, pull in ice goblins from the surrounding spawns. A pair of 12ths were making 2 blue bubbles a kill off them. Snare pull, let the goblin beat itself to death (grasping root it when it runs so it turns to smack and die). Just be sure to kill the casters yourself, they take far more mana than its worth. Fortunately the ice goblins are the more common spawn. And you can get a pack or mask off the arch, no one hunts there except for the named.<BR><BR>This will get you at least a level a night (2 to 3 hours of killing, max), I worked two 12ths to 16th/17th there in a few days.<BR><BR>1 - 5 newbie lands, wolfform and one of them being a bard just sponged exp up at a furious rate.<BR><BR>6th to 9th on the orcs in S Ro.<BR><BR>10 - 12 on the WK bandits, there are many spawns in the mountains, and they are never camped.<BR><BR>Then to perma. Note the common point, nothing they killed was camped by people hunting in their own weight class. Its rude to PL where people are hunting. Which is why places like Unrest and MM are off my PLing list. But you can always find gobbos uncamped, say in the OOT.

An Enchanter is the master of the powerlevel too. Once your little buddy hits 12th pick up memory blur. (I'd do NRo, WC, LoIO and such areas to get to 12th, it really should not take long.) With memory blur you can forget the whole porcupine levelling bit and do things in style. The Druid picks something about three levels above the Enchanter. He then nukes into into submission, the flight but snared stage. Our intrepid Enchanter then Mem Blurrs it three times or so and finishes with a nuke or poking it in the back. Voila, full experience for the Enchanter. Mix in some old fashioned porccing to keep those neglected finger-wiggler defensive skills up and you have an Enchanter on a mission. <BR> <BR>vermis mysteriis<BR>Registered User<BR>(2/16/01 9:52:51 pm)<BR>Reply  Re: Powering an Enchanter...<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> *bump*<BR><BR>i found the sarnak castle in loio to be amazing for pling my chanter twink.. went from 20ish to 29 there, my brothers sk did the same with me while my dr00d sat back and healed/ds aswell as the regular buffs. we were probly making EVERYONE really pissed, as we could and would take just as many mobs as a full group sitting near. glad my bro has turned out to be a good puller = )<BR><BR>vermis mysteriis<BR>53rd wanderer of prexus<BR>*A Fire Inside* <BR> <BR>Kales<BR>Registered User<BR>(2/20/01 1:00:46 pm)<BR>Reply  bump.<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> Just a bump.

Here is my summary of where I did it.<BR><BR>1-6 Misty - great newbie zone, I couldn't pull fast enough, mobs to spare.<BR><BR>6-10 Sro Derv camp - Nobody here, ever. This is on E'ci with 2800 people on.<BR><BR>10-17 Unrest Yard - OMG, if you have never PL'd here, this is the place for you! I would run my cleric around and argo huge trains. Pull back to where I parked my druid and the mobs would line up to hit me. Only 4 would hit at once, the rest would wait in line! Also, nothing runs away, best zone to PL IMHO.<BR><BR>17-25 Mist Moore - Another great spot, I tried LOIO at this level and it is WAY over camped. I can remember leveling my druid there and the mobs ran free. Now, its a rare to see a roaming mob on in LOIO on my server. I did manage to do a level or 2 in the goblin tunnels, that was decent.<BR><BR>25-29 Upper Guk - I went to Uguk and headed to the live side zone. Set up camp in the small room right at the zone line. I love this place, but I think its time to zone over to lower guk, live side and start doing the bedroom and minos. <BR><BR><BR>Nealin lvl 49 Druid - Quinan lvl 54 Mystic<BR>Officer of The Unnamed, E'ci<BR><!-- BBCode auto-link start --><a href="http://www.theunnamedofeci.com" target="_blank">www.theunnamedofeci.com</a><!-- BBCode auto-link end --><BR> <BR>Scorpie Tundrawolf  <BR>Registered User<BR>(3/7/01 12:48:19 am)<BR>Reply  Re: Best Power Leveling Location<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> Lets see if i can remember, its been a while.

Wow.<BR><BR>Also, you can assume you never let your monster get above level 45 and ease off the increase from player level 35 to 45, so that while he is level 45 the monsters are level 45. Then you do not greatly increase the kills needed to level.<BR><BR>Example:<BR>At level 45 you need to kill 96 level 55 monsters to level.<BR>At level 45 you need to kill 105 level 45 monsters to level.<BR><BR>So this may help you keep the low minute delay between kills.<BR><BR>In any event, if this is true, I am very much in awe.<BR><BR>Numbers based off a halfling druid (they require the LEAST to level; so other classes will require MORE kills).<BR><BR>Want to check my figures, please do, the data is taken from the code of the game itself.

I'm proud of the fact that most of his primary skills are pretty well maxed out, including divination for invis to undead. His conjuration is pretty weak, haven't worked on any weapon skill but 1HB, but I figure that's enough since clerics don't need to be in melee at higher levels anyway. Most importantly his defense is maxed. I spent some time chain casting for points occasionally and I spent a couple of hours with my druid doing some quest related stuff while on my other computer, the cleric was just swimming in place for that skill.<BR><BR>I spent my clerics lower levels in Butcher Block. Dwarf skeletons until level five or so, then the chessboard till about 10 maybe.<BR><BR>South Ro pulling dervs, ghouls, dry bones till about 15.<BR><BR>UNREST!!! 15 to about 25 in wolf form is fantastic. I'd pull yellows and reds for my cleric, gaining a little extra experience from the inevitable yard trash that would join. I could pull, pick and choose the mobs I wanted for my cleric, while he was relatively safe outside, since he was non-KoS in wolf form. When the morons made trains, most of the time we were on the wall by the back door, so we avoided them or if a train came by and we weren't fighting, I could just let it pass by and it would ignore us. I only had to zone once I think in the entire time I power leveled here.<BR><BR>LOIO at the goblin caves from 25 to 30. I scoffed when a buddy suggested LOIO because the gobs were blue to my cleric, a few even cons when he was at 25. That was until the first few kills. Incredible experience from LOIO mobs, and surprisingly, even when there were 100 folks in the zone, the caves wouldn't be heavily camped. Go figure.<BR><BR>Tizmaks from about 30 to 38. The experience from each tizmak isn't that great, but the cave entrances have an incredible spawn rate, so I was killing non-stop. Once my cleric got to 34, my druid could have up to four tizmaks dying from ES Vambraces, while my cleric would Atone the most dead tizmak, rooting it if my druids root broke, and letting it beat itself to death on the thorns.<BR><BR>Crystal Caverns 38 to 39 maybe to 40. Take the left tunnel after the broken bridge and kill the tentacles. Again, mad spawn rate and you can single pull with a high level druid.<BR><BR>I plan to start getting into groups with my cleric post 40 since he is now at the point whereby he will be valued over shaman and druids for healing duties.<BR><BR>Robyn Goodfellow<BR>54 Wanderer Prexus <BR> <BR>Ogma<BR>Registered User<BR>(3/14/01 3:40:30 pm)<BR>Reply  Re: Cleric PL<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> bump <BR> <BR>Sllack Blader  <BR>Registered User<BR>(3/19/01 2:42:16 am)<BR>Reply <BR>  Re: Best Power Leveling Location<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> 6-14 : Befallen<BR>14-25 : Unrest<BR>25-31 : MM<BR>31-46 : Lower Guk<BR><BR>This is a generic template, I have used it 2 times (working on 3rd) and it works well for me. <BR>Bllack Ader - Dr00d in Agony.

Usually takes about 6 hours to go from level 5 to 16, depending on the particular class and how good the people you are PLing is. IE knows to hit every mob on him at least with 1 dmg. Melee classes are the quickest.. especially monks and warriors.<BR><BR>After that I usually do a Shadowman camp, they spawn fast and are many. The only ones that cause problems are the Cleric class ones. And there are many zones that have Shadowmen camps. That works fast til about level 25 or so.<BR><BR>Past that, I don't do much PLing as it takes awhile, but in the higher end leveling, 35+ quad kiting Spirocs in TD is nice all the way up to 45.

A great way to get out of 45. =) <BR><BR><BR>Nealin lvl 49 Druid - Quinan lvl 54 Mystic<BR>Officer of The Unnamed, E'ci<BR><!-- BBCode auto-link start --><a href="http://www.theunnamedofeci.com" target="_blank">www.theunnamedofeci.com</a><!-- BBCode auto-link end --><BR> <BR>Weezul  <BR>Registered User<BR>(4/13/01 10:35:18 am)<BR>Reply  Re: Best Power Leveling Location<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> One of my fave spots is the 5th floor of Tower of Frozen Shadow, doing the Ushers. All of them are good exp up to about 47 or so, you CAN get xp with them all the way to 51, but you'll go through a lot of xp greens to do it.<BR><BR>I'm helping a good friend work her warrior up, she's got herself decked out pretty darn good, full crafted dwarf with dual yaks <IMG SRC="/boards/images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"><BR><BR>Getting up there is the trick... I took her up with my druid and my cleric, cleric has the keys... Invis/Invis vs undead on your way up at each level's mirror/entryway, when you get to the 5th floor you're set to go... you can work your way in pulling with snare and just buff/dmg shield/snare the mobs and heal while they just fight their ass off. It keeps their skills up, at around 30 they are red, and xp will FLY till about 45. We were doing a level in a casual night's play for a while. The reason I did it this way is she can work on her pulling skills, and her other skills stay maxxed, bring a variety of weapons with and let them work the skills up. If you can bring a bunch of bandages with, you can let them get beat down pretty low and use gheal to keep em in "frenzy" mode, the ushers *will* run back down the hallway to the end and "warp" to the right side and keep running in a loop because of it.<BR><BR>IMHO one of the BEST places as far as risk/reward because the money is decent, there's the mirror right close by, and then you have the added bonus of being able to turn around and blast Nosja and Daman at the odd time if the floor is empty, and possibly get rings. I have gotten at least 6 of the rings Daman has dropped... NONE off of Nosja, they've *severely* nerfed those ring drops off of him. The downside is the Enraged Relative. I camped my 50 warrior up there and have a third machine ready to log him in if that one pops... blue to a 54, this thing gives me the added bonus of getting xp for pl'ing someone, but will tear through stuff in melee very fast, so you better have a cleric behind your melee. <BR><BR><BR>EQ:<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Kiisk Silveroak - Valor of Virtopia<BR><BR><BR><BR>51 lvl Wanderer - Povar<BR><BR><BR><BR>Tenderlove Moonlight- Valor of Virtopia<BR><BR><BR><BR>53 lvl Vicar - Povar<BR><BR><BR><BR>Garaz D'Basher - Valor of Virtopia<BR><BR><BR><BR>50th lvl Warrior - Povar<BR><BR> <BR>Doccus  <BR>Registered User<BR>(4/13/01 1:14:01 pm)<BR>Reply  Re: Best Power Leveling Location<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> For folks doubting the "I got lvl 50 in xxxxxx days" sort of stuff ....<BR><BR>When you make your arguments, please keep in mind that MANY quests out there (and no, I'm not going to list them so Verant can NERF them) result in close to a yellow bubble per pop.

It's not just the bone chip quest that can "zoooom" ya through the levels.<BR><BR>Not that I'm advocating it, as your skills will suffer ... but I used a combination of quests to get through level 35 the first time (was getting so frustrated with the Hell level and EQ that I almost quit). I had spent over a week in 35, and had one yellow bubble.

(made friends with most of the people whom I PLed). I've done four warrior, three rogues, a monk, a mage, two rangers, three paladins, two necros. Let me just say that if you're going to PL, try as you as you can NOT to PL a caster. They have low ac, low hp, crappy offensive abilities and they are just plain hard ot keep alive. PLus PLing goes hecka slow with a caster. So go for a tank type.<BR><BR>Here is what I did<BR>Lvl 1 to 4 - Snakes, rats, and all that junk.<BR>Lvl 5 to 9 - Orcs and Dervs in the Southwestern corner of Oasis of Marr. Two orc camps here plus tons of wandering orcs. <BR>Lvl 10 to 14 - Reavers, animals and stuff in EC. Bes tplace is the reaver hill.<BR>Lvl 15 to 30 - Temple of Cazic Thule. I Haven't read many of the posts here, but haven't seen anyone put this down. This is the best place to PL a tank. My warrior (has a 55 ranger as main and is an RL friend) would take his half elf in full FS and run around in the maze until he gets some mobs then comes back to me in the same inner corner inside of the maze. There, I'd hit him with dmg shield, and just relax while watching his hps. Easy as pie and extremely fast exp.<BR>Lvl 31 to 40 - Lower Guk. Best place is the Bedroom to 35 then either Ass/Sav/Cav/Exe (But NOT Sage). <BR>Lvl 41 to 50 - Dreadlands and LGuk. Both are decent, but by now it gets hecka slow and boring. So put on some music, get out your eq papers and just relax. Make the tank pull since he/she should be high enough to do it. <BR><BR>Some guy posted here saying that every 4 levels, the guy should get his skills up. Well, that's good advice, but not necessary. I mean, his skills will be flying when you put him with SLN, Chrolo, DMg Shield and set him against a red mob. Oh, never waste mana. You should never bother with any other buff, except maybe magic resist if you are in LGuk. If you get down to 40m or lower, call a short break and med, especially if the guy you are PLing is in his 30s or higher.<BR><BR>If you're doing the pulling, fudge about safety and pull like two or three mobs. It's hecka fun <IMG SRC="/boards/images/smiles/icon_wink.gif"> Set them against your tank, root and snare all of them, then just watchi the guys health. PLing is as easy as pie as long as you have good mana at all times. If mana gets low and mob's kicking your buddies butt, don't be afraid to say "zone". Oh, and whether the mob runs or not, snare it. Use snar euntil the guy is in his 30s then use ensnare. Just in case. Always expect the unexpected. ANything could happen. <BR><BR>Oh, and usually when you get into the PLing business and get good at it, people give you awesome things. I've been offered lumi staff, 30k, shieldstorm, MoSS, thorneblade of yk, hammerhead helm, smr, iksar regen bp, glowing black stone, Crown of King Tranix, KDs, wu sticks, fighting batons, fbss, tbbs and more. I tell you, get good, play long hours (like me, hehehe) and you'll get rich within a week. If the guy is paying you plat, then make out a system. Like, "pay me every 5 levels" or "pay me every level". Just know that the lower levels, you should not get alot of plat cause they're easy, but at higher levels, you should get plenty.<BR><BR>Anyway, I'm done blabbering. Hope some of that helps ya. ANd yes, in case people haven't noticed, I don't like Kunark or Velious PLs much.

I'm lvl 46 druid. Ported to WC, ran to west FP, put SLD, sow, chloro and dam shield on my friends lvl1 monk and he was halfway through lvl 3 when i had medded full, since i came in there oom. Then ported us to BB, bound him in Gfay and went to unrest. Level 3, yes. Memmed "Healing" spell and off we went to kill beetles. 3 hours later he was lvl12 and we called it a night. At around his lvl 10 when he reached 400+ hps i memmed greater healing. Wolfform of course.. at lvl 11 we just stood in front of house and took whatever came our way. i rooted with grasping roots and healed him.. i guess it's good spot until about lvl 17-18 or so. Then we can move pretty deep into house... or go to LOIO.<BR>About velious.. i think orcs and later stalags/spiders in CC are pretty good.. and around 33-35 you can move to walruses/ulthorks in EW or wolves in GD. Lots of mobs, don't hit hard, don't flee when more than one.

The alluring sirens in OOT. Right when you enter the zone from Butcher, look to the right of the boat. You will see them on some rocks. They are mermaids with orange lower bodies. There's 2 of them, they spawn every 6 minutes or so and give fantastic XP. I took my rogue there at level 10, with my druid standing watch of course. Each kill was a solid blue bubble of xp. By level 13 it was 3/4 a bubble.<BR><BR>But then I took him to Unrest. Unrest is best at that level for one reason: undead never run. They fight to the death. The rogue's dodge, defense, dual weild and double attack just shot up, and he gained 3 levels in like 2 hours. He's now 16 and parked in Freeport. Eventually I'll take him to Oasis and let him earn the rest without Galiana watching his ass. <IMG SRC="/boards/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <BR> <BR>TristamDk<BR>Registered User<BR>(5/1/01 5:09:40 pm)<BR>Reply  Re: Best Power Leveling Location<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> i have only powerlvled my sk to 25 at the moment, but by far the best exp i found from 10-20 was random monsters in Warslik Woods... the best place is the intersection with the iksar monks (one of them drops a bracer of scavaging quite often) the iksars spawn very fast and you can pull brutes and gobies onto the tank while he fights. the best part is its secluded and you dont get hassled or have to compete for spawns, and you can just bind in overthere incase the unthinkable happens <BR> <BR>Khieran<BR>Registered User<BR>(5/3/01 7:47:36 am)<BR>Reply  Re: Best Power Leveling Location<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> You have gotten better at Powerleveling (200)!!<BR><BR>=)<BR><BR>This is a great thread.<BR><BR>I'm currently powerleveling a cleric alt on another account since our guild is woefully short of high level clerics at the moment (only 1 level 49+ cleric in the guild).<BR><BR>1-7 did Misty Thicket (beyond the wall), wasps, giant bats, young kodiaks<BR><BR>7-11 Derv camp in SRO. Nobody ever camps it and you get an occassional Sand Giant so you can make some money while powerleveling your alt/friend. <BR><BR>11-14 Unrest yard trash. OMG, this is incredible. I'd run around the yard and snare everything that moved, bringing back 10-15 mobs at once. Then they'd all bunch up in line waiting to hit me. The Cleric steps into the middle of the group and casts Word of Pain. Hits 4 of them at once, who all turn and beat themselves to death on the dmg shield. Did 11-14 in about 90 mins, plus 1hb, defense, offense are all maxed. Casting skills were maxed at 11, and I plan on maxing them at every 3 levels thereafter so they don't get too far behind.<BR><BR>14-?? Currently in EK at Reaver Hill, but several are blue. May do gorgehounds and dark reavers at the other end of the zone, or go back to Unrest =)<BR><BR>A little different tactic with my Rogue I'm also powerleveling. I'd get mobs that I *know* will run at low health and snare them. That way he gets at least a couple backstab practices on every kill.<BR><BR>Something that nobody has mentioned. If you are worried about mobs running at low health, pull more than 1 at once. Most mobs will fight to the death if there is more than one of them on you. What I do is pull 2 Reavers and hit one a couple times just to do some damage. Then switch to the other one. The first one beats himself to death on the dmg shield while you kill the other.<BR><BR>Plus, I never pull mobs that are so red that the powerlevelee can't hit. I hate standing behind a mob for 10 minutes whiffing at it (unless I need weapon practice =). <BR> <BR> Ellendilh Silvermist<BR>Registered User<BR>(5/3/01 10:22:01 am)<BR>Reply <BR>Community Supporter<BR><BR>  Re: Best Power Leveling Location<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> I am new at PL'ing and used part of this thread to start easy with a warrior. One thing I have noticed, at least for me, is that it is much safer in outdoors areas than in dungeons. If the area is deserted, it is even better.<BR><BR>Here is my path so far:<BR><BR>1-10 : East Karana (beetles, bears, wolves)<BR>11-17: Rathe Mountains (undead ruins)<BR>18-23: Swamp of No Hope (undead ruins)<BR>24-24: Mistmoore - left after 3 deaths (ugh)<BR>24-24: Unrest - left after 2 deaths (ugh-ugh)<BR>24-26: Frontier Mountains (anything but casters)<BR><BR>Dungeons were really not my thing.

Mind you I'm a late night powerleveler. You get better exp from a handful of low blues than a single yellow. Having the twink round is great.<BR><BR>Then, it's time to pl inside the house. A good spot is on the second floor at the end of the hall in the south east corner. This is a pretty popular soloing spot so you might want to move into the room next to the creepy gnome. (looking at the magi room door, it is to your left). You can pull to here from the third floor, the magi room and eventually pull the bartender and knight rooms. <BR><BR>If you're PLing a melee, you will eventually want to hit the basement. If you are over 50, you can powerlevel any class on anything down here, including hags and the ghost himself. Where do you go? The little dead end hall behind the tentacle terror. It is a safe spot. <BR><BR>Just snare anything you pull in there. If your twink can't tank it, just tank it yourself. Snare to keep aggro and let the thorns go to work while the tank does his point of damage. If you have good resist gear you can do the hags the same way. Just heal yourself, they go oom and beat the crap out of themeselves on you. Mob casters are truly great experience.<BR><BR>Another reason I like<BR><BR>My favorite PLing spots are:</FONT><BR></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR="#f7f5e6"><TD nowrap align="left">&nbsp;</TD><TD><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp<a href="/boards/bb_profile.php?mode=view&user=221"><img src="/boards/images/profile.gif" border=0 alt="View Profile of Flaim"></a>
