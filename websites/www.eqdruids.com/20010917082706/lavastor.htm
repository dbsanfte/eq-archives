<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">Young Druid, when you achieve your 14th season,
  get yourself to Lavastorm.&nbsp; The way is easy for one such as ourselves:&nbsp;
  Bind yourself regularly while traveling.&nbsp; Then, before entering Nektulos
  Forest, SOW and Camouflage yourself, and&nbsp;don't stop running.&nbsp; After
  arriving, Bind yourself to your new home.&nbsp; New home it will be, for you
  will quickly grow to love the place.</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">The only common creatures that are aggressive are
  the Fire Imps and Fire Elementals.&nbsp; They respond well to Expulse Summoned
  and for the 60 mana you spend, you can depend on a steady, although not
  guaranteed, 80+ points of damage.&nbsp; At 16th season, I am rewarded with 90
  points damage.&nbsp; Other aggressive creatures are the goblins, green to me
  and practically immobile unless disturbed, and the uncommon spawn.&nbsp; These
  last, I have read, are very rewarding for the difficulty involved in bringing
  them down.&nbsp; I have some experience with one of them.&nbsp; Imagine my
  surprise when I approached a winsome young woman wearing the blue pants and
  white shirt so typical of civilized areas.&nbsp; She attacked me, both
  verbally and physically.&nbsp; Run?&nbsp; Hardly!&nbsp; Even at my early 16
  she conned blue, and I slew her, although with some difficulty, I must
  confess.&nbsp; She had a name, 'though I can't now recall it.&nbsp; I only
  remember that she dropped a Glowing Torch, armor class 7, and raising my
  charisma by 5 points!</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">The others there, the Fire Drakes which shall be
  your first quarry, the Rock Dervishes, Lava Basilisks, Lava Crawlers, and
  others, shall leave you unharmed.&nbsp; 'Tis best, though, to go always
  camouflaged, and cast first Shield of Thistle upon yourself before drawing
  your quarry.&nbsp; Try not the way of &quot;kiting&quot; unless you have a
  taste for lava, and leave your fire based spells in your book, for these are
  worthless on the fire-borne inhabitants.&nbsp; If you are accosted by
  aggressive creatures while subduing your quarry, judge the situation.&nbsp;
  Discretion IS often the better part of valor.&nbsp; With a steady head and
  SOW, the zone will be yours if you are not turned to stone too long or so low
  already in health that you cannot run with the speed SOW imparts.&nbsp;</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">Aha,&nbsp;you seek not only adventure, but
  fortune.&nbsp; Fear not.&nbsp; The most common loot here are gemstones, words,
  and runes, all of lower value, it is true, but none less than a gold worth.&nbsp;
  The most common drop, a bloodstone, is several gold, and when you are lucky
  enough to find a basilisk egg, congratulate yourself on 6 gold pieces work!&nbsp;
  When you must sell (or buy some trinket lest the weight of copper and silver
  become too much for you) then seek out the gypsy camp in the West or the lone
  Gypsy seller at the Druid Ring.&nbsp; But sell not these small, almost
  weightless things for the weightier mass of money, stack them and wait until
  your eventual return to civilized areas and banks.&nbsp; However, part quickly
  with the blocks of ore, which weigh 15 stone, and happily receive your 3 gold
  7 as a lesser encumbrance.</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;

<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">/ooc&nbsp; I play mostly solo, and more than a bit
  on the dangerous side.&nbsp; (In other words, I die a lot.)&nbsp; But
  Lavastorm is the place to spend your latter teen levels with reasonable care.&nbsp;
  I think the really neat drops carried by&nbsp;levels comparatively low for the
  value of loot are Varant's lure to increase use of an underutilized zone.&nbsp;
  They are rare, but not unheard of.&nbsp; Enjoy them while they last.&nbsp; If
  you're going at 14, give yourself a padding of 2 bubbles to make sure a few
  deaths won't rob you of valuable 14th season spells, and it would be safer to
  start by grouping.&nbsp; However, you'll soon have the confidence to go out
  solo or with a friend.&nbsp; The lower level&nbsp;elementals and imps will
  drop with three Expulses and one Lightning, and when the Lava Crawlers become
  reachable, they are also damaged by Expulse.&nbsp; The other mobs, though, are
  not, so&nbsp;Shield of Thistle, Swarm, Lightning and Hail will be your
  standbys.&nbsp; Spend a few levels with the loot here, and by 19 your new
  spells will seem reasonably priced.</font>

  <font face="Arial" size="2">The world is ours at 14.&nbsp; Not every inch of
  it, but enough for variety and experience.&nbsp; Good hunting and watch your
  step:&nbsp; Lava's hot.</font>
