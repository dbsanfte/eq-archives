<p class="MsoNormal">PLANES OF FEAR AND HATE&#151;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;SPELLS TO MEMORIZE</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Starfire- In the planes you nuke a LOT.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Pack Chloroplast&#151;Cast this one, so you can use a Manastone
if you have one, or other part members can, two it cuts down on the healing job
of a cleric after battle.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Share wolf form&#151;Casting share wolf form on your
puller/s lowers the aggro range of the monsters. A must for a successful raid.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Greater healing&#151;Clerics have to heal a LOT in here,
so they are lom or oom quite often, you need to make sure you are a safety net.
(You may not think gheal is worth anything on the planes, but when my group
pulled a dracoliche and tentacle terror in PoF, our cleric was oom and my heals
were the only thing that saved one of our tanks =P)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Shield of thorns- Great way to do extra dmg to
monsters, should always cast this.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Skin like nature-Cast this<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>on everyone, because they&#146;ll all get swung at one time or another and
you want as many hp/acs as possible.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Resist Magic- A lot of the mobs in fear like to
darkness (nightmares), and stun (gorgons), and fear (turmoil toads). This makes
pulling for tanks VERY risky. However it has been my experience that when
you&#146;re without an enchanter to do group resist magic, casting resist magic on
all of your party helps substantially</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;(Note: Why no snare or dot, you ask? Well, snare is
useless, because these mobs don&#146;t run, and if they try, they have like 8
casters or so throwing their best nukes at them so they won&#146;t get very far. No
dot? Nope. There is a dot bug that sometimes causes monsters to poof upon death.
That&#146;s bad. No dots!)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;PLANE OF HATE&#151;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;One would think that all of a druid&#146;s skills would
need to be utilized in a plane. Well that just isn&#146;t the case =P Usually you
have so many people, you can afford to make some mistakes. Basically, as long is
no one is getting beat on, you nuke. Also its your job to keep the pullers in
your group wolf formed. This also reduces aggro range, and in some cases if the
person is agnostic makes them non-kos. Also keep pack chloroplast up at all
times. (Note: Don&#146;t try nuking stone golems, they resist everything but shaman
dots)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;PLANE OF FEAR--<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Same deal here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I highly suggest binding to the safespot however. This has some really
useful purposes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For example, when
my party pulled the dracoliche last night, we had 23 people, which was a
skeleton crew.(no pun intended =P) We all barely managed to kill but, but most
of us died. Now in the midst of the battle a tentacle terror also wandered over
and was having its way with us, everyone was near oom or oom already, situation
looked bad, BUT, about 5 of us were bound to the safespot, so as soon as we
popped back into existence, we memmed our nukes and heals (heals if we had em)
and raced over to the group, and were able to squeeze by and kill the TT. Then a
couple wanderers came over and slaughtered us while we were all rezzing and oom,
but that&#146;s PoF for you =D Also, if a party member falls asleep or something,
or goes LD, you can port back in and get them out. Sucks to be a tank stuck in
the planes. But I&#146;m sure the thought, &#147;What if I die, and something is at
the safespot and I just die over and over and over?&#148; Well 9 times out of 10
there is nothing there, if you just pop up, gate out someplace safe its no big
deal. In the unlikely case there is something there, don&#146;t try to run, just /q
if something is attacking you that way you don&#146;t respawn and let it kill you
again. Wait about 5 mins, login, port out. On a side note, you need to be
prepared for a lot of death in the planes. Personally, my record has been 6
deaths in PoF. CT snipes people, pulls go bad, you get feared, and train stuff
on the group. However let me say it was a LOT of fun, and with the 49 rezzes
death is not so bad.<br>
Oh yeah one last thing. If there is a bad pull. you CAMP. You do NOT under ANY
circumstances evac. If you do so then you need t get everyone in again. It is
easiet to just have the cleric camped there log in and rezz everyone. DO NOT
EVEN MEM EVAC OR ANY GATE SPELL.<!--mstheme--></font><!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table><!--msnavigation--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td><!--mstheme--><font face="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">
