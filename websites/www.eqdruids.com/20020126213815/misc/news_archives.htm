            <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#CC9900">(11/27/2001 Denver, 
            Colorado) – Today, GuildPortal, an online community host for players 
            of Massively Multiplayer Online Games, announced the nearing of 300 
            hosted guilds and player associations supporting over 2200 users.</font></div>

            <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#CC9900">“This shows the 
            viability of the underlying GuildPortal engine,” said Aaron Lewis, 
            developer of the GuildPortal service.&nbsp; “The performance has stayed 
            consistent througout the increase in the number of users 
            concurrently accessing the site, keeping each guild’s portal at 
            least as fast as most single-guild hosted solutions.” </font>

          <div>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#CC9900">The service offers 
            forums, voting, events scheduling/notification, member rosters, news 
            feeds specific to the game a guild plays, chat and an integrated 
            e-mail service.&nbsp; Boasting over 30 different ways to customize the 
            appearance of a guild’s page, GuildPortal claims to be at the top of 
            their game – and yours.&nbsp; “It’s not just fluff, either.&nbsp; If you go 
            check out the options for customization on forum solutions, you’ll 
            see that most if it is filler.&nbsp; It exists solely for the purpose of 
            having something to list in the bi-weekly release notes.&nbsp; 
            GuildPortal really offers you a full solution,” said Lewis.</font></div>

            <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#CC9900">What’s on the horizon?&nbsp; 
            “Right now, GuildPortal is working on putting together a package of 
            Web Services based on the .NET platform.&nbsp; Once that’s done, we hope 
            to be able to work out arrangements with game publishers so that 
            their systems can talk to ours in near real-time.&nbsp; For example, if 
            you create a guild in, say, EverQuest, our web services could accept 
            information from Verant’s servers, automatically creating your 
            guild’s web presence for you.&nbsp; Now, we haven’t spoken to any game 
            publishers yet about this, as we want to get a working framework in 
            place before we do.&nbsp; But it’s something we’re really very excited 
            about.”</font></div>

          the use of 3rd party programs. I hope you confident that EQwatcher is 
          an approved program to use while running EQ. You have been reported
