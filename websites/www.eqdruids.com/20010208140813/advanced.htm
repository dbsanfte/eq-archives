<p align="center">Advanced Guide to Grouping for Druids</p>
</b></font><font size="2">

<p>At later levels (35+) it is essential to form groups to meet people and get
loot =). Not only do you gain added protection, can take stronger monsters, but you
also minimize your down time thus allowing you to level faster. It should also be stated
that almost every single monster that considers blue to you, you will not be able to take
down. At level 35, only Aviak avocets and centaur chargers (that I have seen) are able to
be soloed. Cyclops are possible if you continually cast snare on them to give you enough
time to get far enough way to blast them with your direct damage spells or get off those
damage over time spells. Giants are impossible because you cannot take many of their hits
and also you would run out of mana before the beasts fell. Thus it behooves you to form a
group and stay with that group so that you can learn each other&#146;s limitations and
gain a trust in each other&#146;s abilities; this is the key to survival now. Speaking
that at these levels you have to group, this essay will devote all of its writing to this
important skill: How to Group Being a Druid.</p>
<b>

<p>Healing:</p>
</b>

<p>There are two different parts to this topic. Being the sole healer in a group or having
multiple healers in a group. Two different tactics will be shown but although you have to
have at least one healer, it is much safer to have two.</p>
<b>

<p>Your role as the sole healer:</p>
</b>

<p>It is important if you are the sole healer of a group, to NOT use the greater heal
spell unless it is an emergency. The reason is that when you cast a healing spell, the
monsters treat you as if you damaged them for the amount you healed a group member. Thus
if you cast greater heal on a party member, ALL of the monsters will each think you did
270 points of damage to them. This will cause the druid to go to an early grave, prevent
you from healing later, and disable your many other abilities. In other words it will get
you killed, and without a healer in the group your party will not last long. Need I also
mention that this is the longest down time of any possible circumstances? Because of this,
it is best if you use the lower level version of Heal. This spell heals 80 points of
damage, thus the monsters will not be pissed off at you to the point that you cannot get
them off you and further aid your group members. I suggest using Greater Heal only when
your party is done fighting and during rest periods. If after you heal you do get
attacked, immediately call out &quot;ON ME&quot; to signal to your group members they need
to pull the monsters attacking you off you as soon as possible. This also goes with groups
using multiple healers.</p>
<b>

<p>For situations with multiple healers:</p>
</b>

<p>This is the safest and most efficient group. In almost all high-level dungeon areas
where there are multiple monsters that rush the party at once, you almost definitely need
more than one healer. For the reason as to why, see the scenario up above. At the forming
of the group and BEFORE you go adventuring; make sure it is clear who is the PRIMARY
healer and who is the SECONDARY one. The primary healer is the one that casts the first
heal spell. This person can use their most powerful heal spell and still stay safe. Why?
As in most fights, as soon as that initial heal spell gets off, all extra monsters will
attack that healer, and sometimes even all of the monsters will do so. You are safe though
because of the secondary healer. Once the primary is taken out, the secondary can take
over the healing while the rest of the group tries to wrestle the extra monsters off the
primary healer. If you are worried about the second healer getting attacked, believe me
when I say don&#146;t. Yes on occasion the secondary healer will be attacked also but it
is very easy to pull the monsters off them. In fact it becomes easier to get the multiple
monsters off the primary healer because after the secondary casts, all of the monsters
become less aggressive to the primary. In addition to this, when you delve deep into
high-level dungeons, you need to be prepared to cast that emergency escape spell Succor.
Thus druids always need to be the secondary healer to ensure that the escape route is
ALWAYS open. This spell still takes a long time to cast; thus the group members need to
ensure that the druid is relatively safe at all times. When healing, never let your group
members fall below two bubbles of health. When fighting casters, a couple of bubbles can
disappear before you can blink. In addition to this, it ensures that your party is as safe
as they can be during all moments of battle. I have been in groups when people would not
heal until the last 2 bubbles. This is horrible. What happens when a lag spike hits and
you do not have a chance to heal before that member dies? What happens when a spell caster
comes walking along and begins to attack that person also? As I stated, two bubbles can
disappear really quickly. Your role as healer is to keep your party members safe.</p>
<b>

<p>Group Gates and Emergency Gates:</p>
</b>

<p>Druids along with wizards get the ability to group gate, but druids do so at an earlier
level. This allows the druid to do 2 things. </p>

<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">

<!--msthemelist--></table><!--mstheme--><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">

<p>Keep in mind that group gate spells take a very long time to cast. Therefore the druid
should always have the Succor spell (emergency escape spell) memorized when exploring a
dungeon. This spell takes half the time of the normal gate spells to cast, thus making
letting it have a higher chance of getting off without getting interrupted. It has been
rumored that this spell will sometimes leave a group member behind. I can honestly tell
you that this is never the occasion providing that the members are NEAR the caster. When
someone yell&#146;s GG or Group Gate, all party members should run to the druid
immediately so they do not get left behind. The radius of the spell is only a few feet so
make sure you get close enough. A rule of thumb is, if you cannot hear the spell sound
(sounds like thunder) then you are too far away. Because this spell takes a long time to
cast, the druid needs to remember a few things. Never heal first in a battle. Doing so
will cause the extra monsters to attack you thus preventing you from being able to cast
succor. When fighting spell casters, never stand near the monsters. If the spell casters
cast an area affect spell and it hits you, it has a chance of interrupting your spell,
especially if the spell makes you move a little bit. And yes, higher level casters
frequently cast a spell called Freezing Winds (something like that). Also, standing away
from the melee lessens the chance that a monster might decide to take a quick swing at
you.</p>
<b>

<p>Buffing:</p>
</b>

<p>Druids get basically two buffs they can cast in dungeons. Skin like xxx and Strength of
xxx. When buffing your party members, cast all the buffs at the same time as you cast them
on yourself. This allows you to know exactly when a spell expires without having the need
for your members to remind you all the time. Only buff the fighters of the group also.
Since they will be dealing and taking the majority of the damage, you need to make sure
they are buffed. Do not waste your spells on mages and other non-melee members. It is
simply a waste of mana increasing your down time. </p>

<p>If you have a cleric in the guild, let them do all of the shield and armor class buffs
while you do the strength buffs. Cleric and druid shield spells do not stack and the
clerical versions are much more powerful. If you have a shaman in the group let them do
all of the buffs. You can still cast your skin like xxx spell since those are stackable
with shaman armor class buff spells. In addition to this, shamans have much more powerful
stat affecting boosts than any other class. Again, make sure ONLY the fighters of the
group get buffed or it will increase your down time with no benefit.</p>

<p>Damage shields are the druids greatest buffs, and they stack with all other buffs
except for a wizards own damage shields. Cast these spells BEFORE you pull monsters. It
will last the duration of the fight though, so you will not need to keep refreshing it.
Never start a battle without it. Why? The mana cost of these spells is relatively small,
the damage they do is pretty significant thus shortening the length of the battle, and
they can turn the tide in tough melee battles.</p>
<b>

<p>Meditating or Fighting:</p>
</b>

<p>Because of a druid lack of melee skills, a druid should NEVER melee unless they are
fully charged of mana. After you as the druid cast a few spells, sit down and meditate
immediately. Do not run into battle to assist the fighters. The damage you do is pathetic
compared to them and your spells are much more damaging or helpful. The key is to have as
much mana as possible. This allows you to cast more offensive spells if that is your role,
or for you to cast more healing spells if that is your role. Another rule of thumb, never
go below 20% of mana EVER. Why? You need at least 1 bubble of mana to cast that succor
spell. If you are fighting in battle and use up 80% of your mana, tell your group
&quot;OOM!!&quot;. This signals to them that you cannot cast anymore spells and need to
meditate. A druid that wastes all of their mana right before that nasty level 50+ monster
comes to town will ensure the party&#146;s death.</p>
<b>

<p>Snaring or Rooting:</p>
</b>

<p>Always have one or the other memorized. These spell lines prevent the monster from
fleeing the battle area and allowing it to summon more monsters to its aid. Have you ever
had one monster get free and disappear for a few minutes only to have it come back with 20
monsters? It can get really chaotic. As druids, we root worse than any other class. Get
used to it. If possible have another caster root the monsters. When rooting, make sure you
do so BEFORE it is about to flee, or it just might get past that turn and get our of your
line of sight. Snare in my opinion works better. It works more often and has the same
effect if not better when the monster tries to flee. Since the movement of the creature is
not actually halted, it will not keep attacking the party when it tries to flee. This is
not true with the pure root spells. In addition to this, snare uses almost no mana&#133;.
Thus reducing down time.</p>
<b>

<p>Dungeon Traps:</p>
</b>

<p>Many of the higher level dungeons have traps in them. If a group member falls down the
trap, tell them not to move. Usually when the member falls down, they will attempt to
return to the party. This succeeds in only doing two things. </p>

<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <!--msthemelist--><tr><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="_themes/nature/anabull1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td><td valign="top" width="100%"><!--mstheme--><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">bringing a train with him or<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--></td></tr>

<!--msthemelist--></table><!--mstheme--><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">

<p>A nice thing (and a bad thing cause an NPC can do this) is the ability to heal through
walls. Thus if a party member falls down a hole and gets separated, the healer can
still keep that person alive. In addition to this, it allows the healer to lure the monsters off
the trapped person and keeping them safe. Remember, if you fall down a trap, do not move,
call your group, and have them rescue you. If it becomes viable to do so, have the members
get close to the druid and just teleport out to safety. This spell does teleport between
floors since it is a global diameter instead of a plane.</p>
<b>

<p>Which Spells to Memorize:</p>
</b>

<p>I personally use the following spell line-up and it works great for me. Greater
Healing, Skin like Diamond, Spikecoat, Shield of Spikes, Firestrike, Snare, Endure Magic,
and Succor: East. I suggest you make sure you always have at least 1 healing spell, 1
direct damage spell, the succor spell, and snare spell memorized at all times. The other
spells are optional but Shield of Spikes is a great spell to use in fights.</p>

<p>I hope this guide allows you to be safer in your travels, as well as keep your party
safer. To all of you, good adventuring.</p>
