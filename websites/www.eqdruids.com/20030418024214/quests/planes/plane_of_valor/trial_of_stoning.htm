  <b><font face="Arial">You can only do this quest with a single group. 
  Completing this quest (or any of the other trials) will give you access to the 
  Plane of Storms and the Plane of Valor <br>
  <br>
  Talk to Mavuin in the basement cellblock. Hail him and follow the dialogue. He 
  will ask you to plead his case before the Tribunal, aggreeing will grant you a 
  character flag. <br>
  <br>
  Head to the area with The Tribunal, and ask them about Mavuin. Following the 
  dialog, saying &quot;I am prepared&quot; to each Tribunal will give you description of 
  the six trials. <br>
  <br>
  To do this one, say &quot;I am ready to begin the Trial of Stoning&quot;. Make sure you 
  are actually prepared when you say that because your group will be teleported 
  to the event area where you will only get a few seconds before things start.
  <br>
  <br>
  In this trial 4 mobs spawn, they can be rockmen, earth elementals, or spectres. 
  When mobs are up, so are two archers (forget exact names). They are 
  untargetable and shoot you for like 90-100 damage while fighting. Rockmen of 
  course are unmezzable, and spectres are mezzable. The boss is the same as all 
  the others -- melees for 700s, slowable, has an AE dot that also has a snare 
  component to it. <br>
  <br>
  Finishing this gives you the Mark of Stoning. <br>
  <br>
  Now talk to the Tribunal and say &quot;what evidence of Mauvuin&quot; and they will tell 
  you that they have consented to hear Mauvuin's case. Head back down and talk 
  to him and he will ask you to go see Karana and Mithaniel Marr. This will flag 
  you to be able to enter the Plane of Storms and and Plane Valor. <br>
