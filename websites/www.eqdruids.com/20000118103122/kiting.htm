<p>Once you make level 14 you have available to you a technique that I have mentioned in
other places...but decided to devote special attention to it.</p>

<p>Kiting IS NOT AN EXPLOIT!&nbsp; This has been verified by Verant and MANY GMs online.
&nbsp; Other players may whine about it - but it is not an exploit, simply a use of our
Karana given skills.</p>

<p>1. Make sure you have maxed your Conjuration with Whirling Wind through level 13<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If not conjure a pile of food and water once hitting 14<br>
2. Purchase Spirit of Wolf and Stinging Swarm - put them in your book and memorize them<br>
3. Go to an area that is really wide open - like North Karana or South Karana (NOT a
dungeon)<br>
4. Run around camo'd until you find your target - usually an even or yellow that runs slow<br>
5. Make sure you have a fresh SoW<br>
6. Cast Swarm on the offending MOB and run like hell<br>
7.&nbsp; After about 45 seconds, stop and cast Swarm again when in range<br>
8.&nbsp; Run Like Hell some more<br>
9.&nbsp; Either it dies or you run out of mana<br>
10. You might want to melee the last bubble of health to keep your skills up<br>
11. If you run out of mana...go for the zone<br>
12. Takes a long time to do this - up to 10 minutes </p>

<p>Kahlan's Variation</p>

<p>1. Fresh SOW, SLR, and Barbcoat, hell even Firefist if you want. Med up to<br>
get the mana back<br>
2. Cast Summon Swarm on the mob...<br>
3. Run like hell for about 13 seconds...<br>
4. This should put you far enough away from the mob such that you can turn<br>
around and cast Dizzying Wind on it, turn around and run away again without<br>
even getting hit if it's done right. ( this takes a bit of practice to get<br>
the timing right. )<br>
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4, about 4 times.<br>
6. By this time your mob should be dead or very close to it ( Depending on<br>
what it is I suppose. I usually use this technique on Griffawns in North<br>
Karana )... I usually just melee the rest. Of course I cast shield of barbs<br>
on myself before doing so...<br>
<br>
Ping Pong Kiting from Mordikal</p>

<ol>
  <font SIZE="2">
  <li>Hook up with my friend. Normally a wizard but this will also work with other casters or
    someone with a good bow skill.</li>
  <li>Cast a fresh SOW on both parties</li>
  <li>Meditate back the mana lost form the buffs</li>
  <li>Pick the target and make sure both parties know which target. </li>
  <li>Position my partner about 5 seconds run away</li>
  <li>DOT the target and run towards my partner</li>
  <li>When the target is within range your partner blast it with their best DD spell</li>
  <li>Break off at 45 degree angles from each other and the monster will follow one of you
    (normally you).</li>
  <li>Run about 7 sec and pull a 90 degree turn toward where your partner is. He should do the
    same. </li>
  <li>Whichever one of you is not being chased needs to blast the monster as it approaches.</li>
  <li>Repeat this process until the monster is dead.</li>
</ol>

<p>This combined the Ping Pong technique with the Kiting technique very effectively. As a
level 14 Druid running with a level 13 Wizard we routinely killed red ghouls in West
Karanas. This despite not having a Magical Weapon. 3 passes would normally kill the
critter. And all our mana would be back before the critter respawned. </p>
