  Bracer</font></b></p><p><font face="Arial">You say, 'I wish to acquire a 
  bracer' <br>
  <br>
  Cheyloh Greenwood says 'Then you shall work to obtain that which you desire, 
  my friend. Nature's gifts are not given without justification and you must 
  prove yourself worthy of this most sacred of our items. I will ask that you 
  venture out into the wilds and procure the Polished Jade Blossoms and the 
  Bracer of Braided Pine and return them to me. The Jade Blossoms are not 
  traditional flora -- they are of the jade stones carved by our artisans and 
  blessed by our elders. You will likely find them in the Potameid Caves, where 
  many of our recently lost charms have turned up as of late. The Potameid 
  Temptresses use the blossoms as charms around their necks, from what the 
  scouts have gathered. To acquire the bracer, you must seek out Lerian 
  Wyndrunner, who currently resides in the Surefall Glade, and seek his 
  guidance.'' <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what is the bracer of braided pine?' <br>
  <br>
  Lerian Wyndrunner says 'This is an item that you will need to work hard to 
  obtain, my friend, but I shall guide you through this task -- if you can 
  appeal to the world that you have dedicated your life to and receive her 
  acceptance and gifts. I will need two specific items from you to create that 
  which Cheyloh has requested of you. Those items are the Black Rawhide Bracer 
  and the [Braids of Pine]. The rangers of the Jaggedpine Treefolk have informed 
  me that Ryleen Bladespur, one of the poachers to have recently infested our 
  forest, has made her way to South Karana to sell much of her stolen wears 
  within the underground market of Norrath. Seek her out and you will find the 
  bracer.'' <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what are braids of pine?' <br>
  <br>
  Lerian Wyndrunner says 'This item you will need to make on your own by 
  carefully weaving strands of Shadowjade Moss, Jaggedpine Needles, and Potameid 
  Braids into one delicate strand. The forest will offer the Shadowjade Moss and 
  Jaggedpine Needles to you if she deems you worthy of her gifts. The braids, 
  however, you must take from the Potameid Wildlings of the Hatchling River. Be 
  sure that your mastery in the ways of tailoring are in the forefront of your 
  mind when you attempt this feat, for anything less will result in the 
  destruction of these delicate materials.'' <br>
  <br>
  Ryleen Bladespur is roughly the same as the two previous Bladespurs, and can 
  be found in South Karana, south-west of the aviak village. </font></p><p>
