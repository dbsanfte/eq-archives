Yes, Friends! We now have an updates page, which means that you no longer have to wade through every page, trying to figure out what has changed since you last visited. And not only do we point out which stuff is new, we even provide a link directly to the specific page!
Oh, these modern conveniences........:)<br><b><hr></b>


<br>
<b>11/4/03:</b> Baking guide updated again, now including the guide to making Misty Thicket Picnics.
<br><br><hr>

<br>
<b>11/4/03:</b> Brewing guide updated to include Planes of Power era stuff, many thanks for those who suggested fishing grubs. Also updated the about me page.
<br><br><hr>

<br>
<b>10/4/03:</b> The Fletching guide is now sparkly and new, and hopefully correct and up to date.
<br><br><hr>


<br>
<b>16/3/03:</b> Yes Friends, it's that time again! Well, it's not time for Xanthe's Cobalt Codfish Countdown Extravaganza, if that's what your thinking, but it certainly could be the very next best thing! It's time for an update! University is over for this term, and I have a 5 week break, thank god. Over this time I hope to give the page a good shake and beat it with a large stick to get all the dust out. Two expansions have come out since I last updated (scarey isn't it?) and a lot of stuff is looking a bit dated. Updates will be made as and when, and hopefully by the end of it all the site should be completely up to date with the latest information and the like. Keep your eyes peeled! (A potato peeler is best for this, although if you do not have one to hand a regular knife will do. Mind your fingers).
<br><br><hr>


<br>
<b>27/10/02:</b> The Baking guide is now fully refurbished for all your foodly needs. The Enhancing Grub! page has not been recently updated as that is a MAJOR undertaking, and I'd rather get the main guides done first:)
<br><br><hr>



<br>
<b>12/8/02:</b>Today brings a fairly large update. The Brewing guide has been completely revamped, and I have added a second page related to brewing concerning Stat Drinks and the making thereof. The Tips page has been updated to be more accurate. I have added a walkthrough of the Faction Amulet quest in Shadowhaven that makes vendors be a little more friendly. Added a section on Tradeskill Trophies, for Grandmasters hoping to get their paws on the implement of their obsession. Oh, and one other small thing....<p>
<center><b><font size=+8 color="ff0000">DING! 250 Tailoring!</b></font></center><p>That is all.
<br><br><hr>




<br>
<b>4/8/02:</b>"OMG!" I hear you say. Something's been updated! Yes friends, the Smithing Guide has been rehashed to be in line with the new trivials and recipes! The guide has been fully stripped down and rewritten, and the route recollated. AND! AND! I know the layout of the guides can be a bit cumbersome, and hard to wade through for a particular thing you want, SO I've finally gotten around to designing the anchor link Navigation Bars for each page. Just click on the topic you want, and it'll scroll down the page to that section, without you having to look manually. Just a little change, but it makes life a lot easier:)<br><br>
A little bored with EQ atm, so expect within the next few weeks to see more of the guides being updated, and a few new bits and pieces being added. Xanthe lives!
<br><br><hr>


<br><b>2/6/02:</b>
Just a quick note. As you may notice, I don't get time to update the page very much, which does annoy me a bit, as there are always many things I can see that I want to do with it. I have just made a slight change on the Protection of the Cabbage spoiler, regarding Jumjum Stalks, as the ones bought from a vendor work for that now aswell, which is great:)<p><br>
Among other things that I am wanting to get done sometime are adding in all the new stat foods to the baking list of useful things. Also need to add in some new recipes for baking to get us past 200. Still need to finish coding up the complete list of rogue poisons. It's been nearly done forever, but I just havent had the time to finish it. Some new pottery is due to go in. Also, something I would really like to add is a Xanthe's Favourites page, where I can list recipes for things that I really like, but aren;t used to skill up with. Some really nice things went in with the last patch, and I'd like to get them up there. <p><br><b>Also, on Wednesday 5th June there is due to be a patch. It is suspected that for Smithing at least, some trivials will be coming down, most notably on Fine Steel Plate. As soon as I am aware of the new trivials I will try and get them up, I think the whole smithing page will need a complete overhaul though.</b><p><br>
Tbh, I would really like to give the whole site a good shake down, it's been over a year since most of the guides were written, and while they are still pretty handy, they do need updating. If you look at them and find all the new stuff is missing, I apologise, and I do intend to get it done, but generally my workload is a bit stupid. But thankfully, another few weeks of Uni and I'll be on the Summer Holidays! RAR! Which means a couple of months free time, where hopefully I can get it all sorted:) Stay tuned for updates coming soon!
<br><br><hr>


<br>
<b>12/5/02:</b>What a weekend! Completed the tradeskill quest for the Druid spell Protection of the Cabbage! First one to do it too, as far as I know. Yes, I'm proud:) And tired...../zzzzz<br><br><hr>

<br>
<b>26/4/02:</b>Ugh. I really need to go through this site and do some updating and stuff, but alas, University dictates I do not have the time. But, i have updated the trivials on Centi Steaks, Centi Toe Stew and Mind Worm Steaks, to 188. That'll have to do you for now!
<br><br><hr>


<br>
<b>8/3/02:</b>Some new baking added due to recent patch. Another recipe that looks like it may hopefully take us over 200! Also, finished added stats for the high end tailored armours. God that was boring, I hope you appreciate me:) Should be more updates in the near future as a ton of trade related stuff was shoved in with the patch, working recipes being hunted down as we speak!
<br><br><hr>

<br>
<b>12/2/02:</b>
Oh and by the way, can you say GRANDMASTER TAILOR? YEAH BABY! YEAH!<br><br><hr>

<br>
<b>12/2/02:</b>
Stealth updated the Tailoring page over the last week or so, to include the Velious tailoring recipes, which for some reason weren't in there. Also included are stats for velious and acrylia gear, still in progress atm. Also added an updated screenshot of the wonderful me to the About Me page. Should be updating various other small items in the next coming weeks, scheduled around university coursework.
<br><br><hr>

<br>
<b>23/1/02:</b>
Added tables to the Baking section listing stat enhancing foods that can be made. They're a useful product, so there they are. Enjoy! <a href="foodstats.html">Enhancing Grub</a>.
<br><br><hr>

<br>
<b>26/12/01:</b>
Whoops again! I had a funny feeling this morning that I had forgotten to do something, and what do you know, I had. I missed out updating the tailoring pages with the new Acrylia Leathers, but they're all done now. Silly me:) Also updated the About Me section.<br><br><hr>

<br>
<b>23/12/01:</b>
Whoops! I forgot about Alchemy (sorry). Added one potion that has a pretty much definite trivial point. Will add more, as they are discovered. By the way, does anybody know where Belgar went? The address I have for his site does not appear to be working. Someone emailed me about it a while ago, but I haven't been able to find him again yet. Great site, I  shall have to look into that some more.<br><br><hr>

<br>
<b>23/12/01:</b>
Well, I think that's it all done:) Parents in law went out today, so I nabbed a bit of time on line, and I think I've added all the relevant skill up stuff. Once again, I'd like to point out that this is not a page where you can find a list of everything that can be made, but generally only things used to skill up, or things that can be usde in another skill. New items are up on the Fletching, Smithing, Baking, Brewing and Tailoring pages. I don't think I have missed anything useful, but please feel free to let me know, so I can get it sorted:)<br><br><hr>

<br>
<b>23/12/01:</b>
Right, well there's a start:) Added Pixie Powder Cinnesticks to the baking pages, as another skill up recipe for over 200 skill. No longer do you have to kill dragons to get better at baking! Woot!<br>
Also, cleaned out my guestbook, so now people can start signing again:) Made an archive of all the old ones, which I shall put a link to for all those people who like to read guestbooks. See, I am doing work!<br><br><hr>


<br>
<b>23/12/01:</b>
Ok, long time since the last update hehe. Quite a few things to be added due to the advent of Luclin and what have you. At the minute my online time is severely limited, alas, and what time I do have, I tend to spend in game. I will however do my best to update will all the relevant stuff within the next week or fortnight. I am going to see my mother in a week, and so my online time should be increased while I am there, so it should all get done:)<br><br>
Not entirely sure how I will structure the new additions as yet, but I'll work something out. I need to update my About Me section aswell, as it's been a good while since it got done:) Also, apparently my Guest Book is full. Haven't really looked in to how to get a new one, does anyone have any ideas? Anyway, apologies for the tardy updates and what have you. Hope to get it done soon, give myself a break from tailoring:)<br><br><hr>

<br>
<b>24/08/01:</b>
The Posions Guide has now been added to the website in it's first incarnation! Woot! Took a good while to sort everything through and get it all in order, so please take a look and let me know if anything is broken that I have missed, and also let me know what you think about it in general. Feedback is good! No graphics as yet because I haven't done them yet, but expect them to be appearing in the next couple of days. Go look!<br><br><hr>

<br>
<b>3/08/01:</b>
Just a quick update to the Baking pages. Recipes included will now take you to around skill 166, as opposed to only 142 on various Pies. Also, a quick sort out of this updates page to hopefully make it more readble.<br><br><hr>

<br>
<b>10/07/01:</b> Long overdue for an update, sorry guys, but I've been soooo busy in game. A few things done today, I have finally gotten around to adding the Fleeting Quiver to the Tailoring section, and the new Idols to the Pottery section. Also added SOW potions to the alchemy chart, should have been in there a while ago, and added Belgar's Ultimate Guide to Alchemy to the links page, where it should have been in the first place, but for some reason got missed. I think that;s it. Will add more as it comes in:)<br><br><hr>


<br>
<b>11/06/01:</b> Added a little section about me for those of you who might be curious, or just plain bored. Enjoy:)<br><br><hr>

<br>
<b>30/05/01:</b> New Tailoring recipes! <font size=+3>WOOT!</font> is all I can say. I know it's about a week since the new Wu's Fighting Armour was found, but hey, I've been killing spiders hehe:) Must....play....EverQuest....Update the page? What page? *irrate tailor smacks Xanthe over the head*....oh, that page.<br><br><hr>

<br>
<b>22/04/01:</b> Well, you asked for it, and now you've got it! The Alchemy guide is fully coded up and live! Aren't I good to you?:)<br><br><hr>




<br>
<b>20/04/01:</b> Howdy folks! For all you people out there who are asking for Alchemy, fear not! I do indeed plan to add it to the site just as soon as possible. I have never been a Shaman myself before, but the idea of Alchemy has always interested me. I will scour (um...dictionary anyone?) the available Alchemy sites in order to come up with a feasible route for you, and hopefully have the whole thing coded up within 2 or 3 weeks.<p>

Also in the future I hope to add Poison Making for you Rogues, and possibly even Tinkering, although the woefully small amount of info available on that skill may hold that one back a bit. I would dearly like to try out all three of these skills myself, but I am unfortunately away from the game right now and will be for at least another month *sniff*. But I can still live vicariously through this site for a while, so look forward to more updates within the next few weeks! (hopefully)<br><br><hr>

<br>
<b>20/04/01:</b> All the links back to the Main Page should now be working. Thanks for pointing that one out...*doh*. Also, a slight clarification on what constitutes a sandwich meat, added Scalers to the Smithing skill up table, and also added a note about the possible 5% chance of failure on any combine to the tips page.<br><br><hr>

<br>
<b>20/04/01:</b> Well folks, it's taken one heck of a lot of work to code this up by hand (I could have used an editor, but I'm picky, and also I don't actually own one...). Still, I feel that all the hard work has paid off, and the first draft is looking remarkably good.<p>
Thanks to all of you who sent me emails with feedback, and little bugs to iron out here and there, I'm on them as we speak. I shall add each of them to the updates page as I go. Thanks again for all your interest, and if you spot anything else that needs doing let me know!<br><br><hr>

<br>
<b>20/04/01:</b> Addition of Updates page! Hurrah!
<br><br><hr>

<br>
<b>19/04/01:</b> Launch of Trader's Workshop - Guides to Mastery via the Everlore News Page, bless 'em:)
