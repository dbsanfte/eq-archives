But still i think it has the potential to be a very cool quest.<BR>First got teh gem from teh dorf that wants the sceptre.<BR>Took the gem and harness to the hunter and got the control harness<BR>waited for the broodmom to appear and gave her teh control harness<BR>followed her about half way to the giant fort when about 6 or so giant fell out of the sky<BR>snared fergul and ran him away from the crowd (had to chase him to snare as he was running away)<BR>as i was getting my distance to start fighting him the broodmother appeared on my head out of nowhere and killed me so fast i was dead before i hit the ground. I think she teleported onto my head the moment my first nuke hit him actually.<BR>i was bound like 40 feet away so i immediately memmed sow snare and scoriae and pounced on fergul , beat him senseless (with help from some bystanders that jumped in) and HIS BODY WENT POOF the instant he died the broodmother, who was stomping towards me still very healthy, also went poof *the moment fergul died*<BR>this quest is ALL KINDS of buggy  and the lag from the broodmom and 6 giants all appearing simultaneously is huge, i was chopping along like quake on a dx 2/66<BR>what really hurts isnt the death without res its teh fact that fergul's body poofed like that and wasted my control harness <IMG SRC="/boards/images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"> <BR>my advice if you're gonna do this quest is to bring a full group for teh final step, with enough people you have a good chance that someone will bear through the massive lag and crazy mixed aggro long enough to down fergul without the brood killing everyone  - beware tho because when you nuke fergul the broodmother will (if you're unlucky like me) teleport onto your head and beat you down<BR>as far as the corpses poofing tho i guess verant will have to fix that problem im hoping that they replace my control harness at least though, wish me luck in getting some help with that:) <BR><BR>Jericho Stormbringer<BR>Registered User<BR>(1/8/01 12:19:43 am)<BR>Reply<BR>Re: Kromniff Military Leggings<BR>I did this quest a couple days ago, with a 59 monk and 60 ranger with me for the last fight with Fergul.  When I handed in the Harness of Control, I invised and followed her to the fort.<BR>Only Grakl and Fergul respawned infront of the fort.  Fergul was blue to me at 59, and was a fairly easy fight.  Funny thing is - while we were fighting/killing Fergul, the Broodmother seemed to despawn, leaving Grakl at about 1/5 hps.  He was green, dropped easy, and had no loot.<BR>I've read several different outcomes with the Broodmother/Grakl at the end of this quest, including one where she became a nearby PC's pet.  I'm very curious to see if the patch on Tuesday will fix the ending here.<BR>Vores tells you to go test the harness on a mother of a wurm...but it seems like the story should have some sort of closure.  I can't get Erdaf or Vores to say anything new to me - the only thing I can think of is to turn the leggings back in to Vores...but that really doesn't seem to follow the storyline...is there another npc around Thurg that might want the leggings? <BR>Jericho Stormbringer &ltDefenders of Honor><BR>The Rathe<BR>Ozbub  <BR>Registered User<BR>(1/8/01 1:55:34 am)<BR>Reply<BR>Re: Kromniff Military Leggings<BR>I've been working on this quest all day yesterday.<BR>Getting the items is fairly easy, but by far the hardest part is getting your faction high enough for you to get the quest in Thurgadin in the first place.<BR>You need to be at least at the top end of Amiable for him to give you the quest.  I started at amiable but didn't get the quest until I had gained about 100 faction increases from killing Dire wolves and Giants.  Doing the Frost Giant Toe quest and the Kromrif Giant Head quest helps a lot.<BR>I haven't got my leggings yet, will do that bit tonight, but helped a fellow druid kill the giant last night.  Was pretty easy with the 2 of us and we didn't have any strange lag problems.  I invised an ran ahead to the fort and snared Fergul and pulled him well away from the fort before the Broodmother got there.<BR>After I get my leggings tonight I will write up a full spoiler and post here...  I have a feeling this quest is going to get very popular...<BR>Ozbub <BR>Trinnity<BR>Registered User<BR>(1/8/01 8:48:12 am)<BR>Reply<BR><BR>Re: Kromniff Military Leggings<BR>Did this quest last night with a couple of guildies.  I thought it was ridicuously easy for the item you get.  I assume Tuesday's patch will correct the buggginess.  I suggest you get them now while you can before Verant Nerfs them.<BR>I'm warmly to the Coldains so getting the quest wasn't a problem.  You can see a spoiler on Allakhazam's.  Look under "Quests by Zone" and select Crystal Caverns...it is the only related quest listed under that heading.<BR>Also, it should be noted (if not already mentioned above) that when in Crystal Caverns, you can use "A bottle of Karsinic Acid" (or something very similar) INSTEAD of the sceptre from the Queen.  Works fine for getting the gem of pursuasion.  I got mine off an ordinary Orc Miner (but I DID have to kill a lot of em').<BR>The Broodmother is buggy.  After I turned in the harness and she came out to the fort, She killed Grakl, we killed Fergul...and then she became a Dire Wolfs Pet!!  I pity the person who attacks THAT wolf!<BR>Hours later she was spotted still touring the zone...<BR>The leggings are great and at all/all many classes will do this quest because of the ease and improvement to what they may be wearing.

I've been quad kiting the wolves and scouts for faction by the wizard spires, so I'll keep an eye out there for him.<BR>In terms of getting the scepter, Crystal Caverns is probably a 35-45ish dungeon.  I got lucky on the first night that Velious opened and the group I was in stumbled into Crystal Caverns and we went all the way to the bottom and killed the Spider Queen a couple of times before they nurfed the spawn rate.  Anyway, I believe it is always camped now and would be very difficult to solo due to the shear amount of green trash that is with her.<BR>However, if the bottle of Karsinic Acid drops of wandering Orcs that should be easy.  The orcs are toward the top of the dungeon and should be fairly easy to kill at your level.

There a alot of spiders in the room.  They killed a full party of lvl 30 somethings.<BR>I suggest just killing all the orcs.  It took some time, but I eventually got the acid bottle.<BR>And yes, I DID turn in the bottle of acid to get the gem of pursuasion.<BR>Remember to be at least amiable before handing into the guy at Thurgadin! <BR>Trinnity Treehugger<BR>Lvl 56 Druid<BR>Council member of The Fellowship of the Griffon<BR>"EverQuest has you..."<BR>EdganStarHeart<BR>Registered User<BR>(1/8/01 11:18:49 pm)<BR>Reply<BR>Re: Kromniff Military Leggings<BR>I have done the quest, all up to the part with Broodmother.<BR>You can turn in acid/sceptre while not amiable.

Harass of Control is no drop. Leggins are no drop.<BR>I am KOS from trying to do Gauntlets of Tactics quest<BR>and have found it easy to get someone with acid to turn<BR>in for gem, give them harass and then have then get harass<BR>of control, then turn in to Broodmother and get leggins.<BR>I would suggest offering 1k for acid/gem/control harass. <BR>Exedor  <BR>Registered User<BR>(1/9/01 4:39:09 am)<BR>Reply<BR><BR>Re: Kromniff Military Leggings<BR>Woot!

Get a bunch of plain old dire wolves to chase you, then introduce them to the tower guards, wolfmasters, and coldain wolves over to the west.  Take the north arm of the valley, which lets out right at the towers.   When there, you just run around the tower in a big circle to let the dwarves and dire wolves get acquainted. You can even snare the dire wolves from time to time if you like.  No faction or XP for this, obviously.  I got two blood wolves in an hour at this high of a turnover rate.<BR>Only do this if there are no other people in the area or hunting the wolves.  Under no circumstances take a train like that to either zone, esp. the Thurgadin zone where many people like to sit and med.  If you can't handle a train like that without endangering others, then don't do it.<BR>I did this quest in one day yesterday.  Queen popped after two hours and was soloable (careful management of the wandering green spider spawn is the key).  At 59, I could pull anything in the room singly.  Took an hour to get the harness.  And about 20 min. to finish off Frostsky.<BR>Both of the giants aggroed on me from in front of the fort.  So I had to root the one to let the BM take him out, and then started with Frostsky.  (BTW, Frostsky spawns to the RIGHT of the main entrance, while G is to left.  If you stand to the right and cast on him from there, you shouldn't have them both chasing after you.  Although I got Frostsky aggroed on me at the start, he started running off to the left back to the zone.  I chased him down and he aggroed on me again.  Eventually the BM caught up to us and "merged" with him.  She stayed right behind him, didn't attack him, and when he was rooted, she was still.  When he started to flee, she followed right behind him.  If I tried to melee Frostsky, the BM started meleeing me....ouch.  When Frostsky went down, the BM went poof.  But Frostsky had the leggings, which is all I cared about....<IMG SRC="/boards/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <BR>Bippo Kupo  <BR>Registered User<BR>(1/9/01 8:14:44 am)<BR>Reply<BR><BR>Re: Kromniff Military Leggings<BR>oooh how interesting.. does it look like black Tizmak or brown Tizmak? <IMG SRC="/boards/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"><BR>Perhaps PURPLE oooh that's be gooofy<BR>'Po of the Rathepo<BR>Jan 6, 2001 - <BR>Aug 8, 2000 - <BR><BR>... 8 more levels to go...<BR>cybergoblin<BR>Registered User<BR>(1/9/01 8:32:18 am)<BR>Reply<BR>Pet Broodmother? - Quest Leggings for free!<BR>I noticed the Brood Mother running around as the pet of a Kromriff Elite.

So I spent a few hours increasing my faction from amiable to a higher amiable, which I did not reach. Anyway, my question is about the broodmother.  Can you give the harness to the broodmother in the wurm caves?  I dont know if VI moved her, but initally there was always a Broodmother in the caves, right near the guardian wurm spawns.  Some people say Fergul is very MR...some say he isnt...can someone post the lvl they WERE at when they did the quest.<BR>Dyngo lvl 53 Druid <BR>HipposPottamus<BR>Registered User<BR>(1/9/01 2:15:02 pm)<BR>Reply<BR>...<BR>Well since someone hasn't pointed this out yet, the acid can also be obtained off of the geonids in crystal caverns. This might have been changed, but about 2 weeks ago I could get say, 5 bottles off of 9 spawns, so it is really easy and doesn't take as long as orcs. <BR>Quaras Shadowscythe  <BR>Registered User<BR>(1/9/01 2:27:24 pm)<BR>Reply<BR>Re: ...<BR>Popping over and killing Fergul before the broodmother attacks does not work.  There are three Ferguls....<BR>1.  Original Fergul inside the fortress<BR>2.  Temporary Fergul who pops outside the fortress<BR>3.  Real Fergul who pops and replaces temporary Fergul the second that the broodmother attacks Grakl.<BR>Also, you do hand the harness of control to the broodmother in the guardian caves not the shardwurm matriarch in the southern caves. <BR>Mbkcd<BR>Registered User<BR>(1/9/01 5:16:40 pm)<BR>Reply<BR>Got mine last night<BR>Quest worked for me at indifferent faction, but he would not give me the quest. he told me to prove my dedication to his cause, but i turned in the bottle of karsin acid anyway and got the gem of persuasion.<BR>rest of the quest worked fine, after handing in the harness of control I invis'd and headed over to the fortress. broodmother finally found her way and started killing gralk. i pulled fergul towards the slope, where the broodmother joined us a few seconds later. she became fergul's pet but wouldnt leave his side, only melee'd us when we were in range of fergul. when fergul died she poofed. other than her becoming ferguls pet the quest worked like it was supposed to. next time the broodmother becomes an NPC's pet i would petition it and /bug it.. find out what the GMs say about it.  <BR>Scirocco<BR>Registered User<BR>(1/9/01 6:58:34 pm)<BR>Reply<BR>3 Ferguls<BR>The 3 Ferguls is what I observed.  I gave the harness to the BM in the cave behind the guardians where she normally sits.  I put up invis and followed her out the north entrance then down the valley to the spires, then up to the front of the fort.  F and G had already spawned.  I attacked the F out front, but he poofed (I had him on my target, but then lost him a few seconds later when the BM attacked G).  F instantly respawned and ran to the zone area, with the BM following as his pet.<BR>Level 59.  Didn't notice any significant resists from F.

You might expect that she would be triggered by turning the items into V the Hunter, but that didn't work for me.<BR>I suspect she simply is a timed spawn with a relatively long respawn time.  If she's gone, it means that someone else has done the quest recently.  I came back 5 hours after finding her gone, and she was up.

It is a random spawn on the dire wolf table (may include scouts, but I don't know).  There is no timer, as I have seen the DBW pop with two minutes of killing a previous one (as part of the next wave of wolf spawns, since I was getting them killed in waves of 7 to 10 at a time).  There is no set location, as I have seen it pop on the north and south side of the spires, up on top of the slopes.  Just keep looking.<BR>The BM is not triggered.  Based on what I've seen, she simply respawns after a period of time (and while this may not need to be said, since I expect most of us camped the guardian wurms at some point, she spawns in the small cave between and behind the guardians, who are, in fact, imprisoning her there).

Karsin Acid works to get your gem of persausion.<BR>2.  In order to RECEIVE the quest you have to have high amiable (so I am told).  In order to DO the quest, I was only mid-amiable.  So in other words, you can still do the quest even if he won't actually tell you about it.<BR>3.  Vores the Hunter is located on the other side of the wurm caves, to the right if you were walking away from Thurgardin.<BR>4.  Broodmother cons indifferent.  Random wurms in the caves see thru invis.  Once you hand in the harness, I was able to invis right back up and hurry up and get to the fort to make sure Fergul as going to run.  As soon as he ran, I was behind him invis.<BR>5.  Quest is very buggy, as has been stated.<BR>6.  Blood Wolf is a random spawn.  Work on that faction, kill as many wolves as you can, and it shouldn't take too long.  1 hour each time for me.  Either that or make HUGE trains and run them to Thurgardin (warn everyone first of course) and just snare and watch the life bars disappear.  Its funny to watch when you switch views at least =).<BR>7.  Erdarf Restil is found in Thurgardin, in a bar near the Temple thingie.<BR>8.  Bottles of Karsin acid come off random orcs. <BR>9.  Leggings are better then Vermiculated.<BR>10.  Had to take two attempts for mine.<BR>First attempt, brought a level 51 cleric and a level 51 monk, with my 51 druid self.<BR>Cleric gets too close, aggros both Grakl and Fergul.  Broodmother arrives, triggers the spawn.  Instead of any despawning, they then became 6 giants, 3 of each of the named. Needless to say, we didn't last long.  Fergul makes it to zone, and despawns.  When he despawns he yells something about making it to Kael for reinforcements.<BR>Failure.<BR>Second attempt, we get far enuff away so that Fergul has a chance to get far enuff away from the fort, but close enuff to stop him from despawning.  I don't have the exact location, but use logic here.  Don't get close.<BR>Took a level 57 warrior, 53 enchanter, 45 pally, 46 wizzy, and myself a 51 druid.<BR>Overkill.<BR>In order to get multiple pairs, I would suspect that you would have to kill Grakl before she does.  As soon as she whacked Grakl, she despawned for us, which really didn't matter since we were only after the one.<BR>Scirocco<BR>Registered User<BR>(1/14/01 11:50:39 am)<BR>Reply<BR>Interesting<BR>I was wondering what would happen if FF got away.

FF for me was waiting on the right side, then the BM attacked, he respawned (the FF I had targeted disappeared) and ran off to the zone.  If you wait on the left side, you'll be able to snag him without any problems.<BR>If you want to take the other giant out as well (I had them both following me for a while until I rooted G for the BM to finish off), just get him kiting.  The BM will follow and won't have much of a chance to hit him.   <BR>Pixal<BR>Registered User<BR>(1/14/01 2:21:37 pm)<BR>Reply<BR>Ughh<BR>Ughhh! I waited on BM for 8 hours last night, no spawn.

To keep this in perspective tho, I have been playing Damon since Jun 99, and gone thru pretty much every change the Druid has seen.<BR>I got the gem by getting the acid off a Watchman.  I got the harness by doing what was suggested here, and training the drakkel's to the guards.  The Blood Wolf has alot of hps.  I only had around 50% mana when he popped, so it took some time.<BR>I had to wait for the Broodmother of course, but just 3 or 4 hours.  Went to EW and fought, and went to Timzak and mass murdered them for awhile.  Got a Cured Tunic, was hoping to get gloves.<BR>Buffed up completely and handed the mother the harness you recieve from Vores.  Invis'd and just followed her to the fort.  Followed the Fleeing Fregul and snared him in what seemed to be an out of the way spot. <BR>I choose to do the root/dot/and now snare method.  The first three casts went perfectly. Snared him, rooted him and dotted him.  I thought "Woohoo" this is gonna be cake.  Well, it waqsn't exactly cake, as the 49 root at 49 didnt hold at that long, and was resisted quite a few times.  The dot was only resisted once.  I am a very stubborn soul tho, so I tried to root/dot/snare until he was half health and i had 2 bubs of mana left.  At that point, I just did the traditional dot med.  There were at least 5 times that the dot wore off before I had enough mana to cast it again. Heh.<BR>Do not get within melee distance when the Broodmother becomes his pet.  They hit very hard combined.<BR>At the very end of kiting him, I turned around after I ran and they were not there.   My heart sunk,  I just spent 45 mins killing this giant and now he has "gated" out of range I thought. What had actually happened was that he went into flee mode finally and then it was cake from there.<BR>I got extremely lucky that nothing joined in on my foray.  Thanks to everyone here for their hard work on this quest.<BR>Quebic The Savage Storm<BR>Registered User<BR>(1/14/01 6:25:50 pm)<BR>Reply<BR><BR>Re: Pet Broodmother? - Quest Leggings for free!<BR>hmmm <BR><BR>><BR>Geldin<BR>Registered User<BR>(1/15/01 4:09:27 am)<BR>Reply<BR>Re: Got mine this morning<BR>We attempted this friday on the rathe. We had 7 people ( Over kill ) We were at the fort and the Dru that had the harness handed it to the BM and then the two named giants came out of the fort and we were to close and aggrod them. We had no choice and killed them. The BM got to the fort and then just turned around and left. I thought that the two named giants were suppose to pop? They walked out of the fort. They were already in there. Has anyone else had this problem?<BR>Geldin<BR>53rd Wanderer<BR>The Rathe <BR>Alliey Mistwalker<BR>Registered User<BR>(1/15/01 4:39:09 am)<BR>Reply<BR>Re: Kromniff Military Leggings<BR>You have to wait for the Broodmother to engage Grakl before you chase down Fergel and kill him.  If you aggro them early, you could lose the quest.  I just got mine Saturday night. Me (51 druid at the time) and a 52 Shaman did this.  Ferfel hit hard, about killed me, root kept breaking, (thank god snare still sticks). <BR>We had fergel at half life when Broodmother killed Grakl and she just de-spawned.  Was happy to see that.  Anyway, I would suggest you all get a pair, because something this good they will nerf. <BR>Alliey Mistwalker<BR>52 Druid  The Tribunal<BR>Pround member of Dies Irae <BR>Scirocco<BR>Registered User<BR>(1/15/01 7:09:55 am)<BR>Reply<BR>Re: Kromniff Military Leggings<BR>Geldin, there are three sets of the named giant mobs.  The first set is inside the fort like always, and have nothing to do with the quest.  Both are easy greens.<BR>The second set spawns when you give the BM the harness in the cave.  These are the guys that stand out front waiting for the BM.  If they aren't there for the BM to interact with, the third set won't be triggered.<BR>The third set spawns when the BM gets to the front of the fort and attacks the second set. Fergul in this set is much tougher than the first set's Fergul.<BR>By "spawn" I mean exactly that.  The previous set despawns and the new set instantly respawns.  The old Fergul poofs and a new Fergul spawns.  For example, I got to the fort a little ahead of the BM and targeted Fergul when he stood outside.  The BM got there, said her bit, and the Fergul I had targeted poofed (disappeared).  I looked around and saw the new Fergul run off to the zone.<BR>Verant does this with a lot of their quests.  Saying something or turning something in will cause Mob X to poof and a new Mob X of the same name to spawn.  Thus, only the third Fergul has the leggings, and he will only spawn if the BM gets to the fort and attacks them as they stand out front.  What you could have done was just root them at the front of the fort, and the BM probably would have attacked them. <BR>Geldin<BR>Registered User<BR>(1/15/01 10:14:23 am)<BR>Reply<BR>Re: Kromniff Military Leggings<BR>Ok thanks Scirocco I appreciate this.

I was quite ticked, thinking that the quest was broken.<BR>I found out later that the Drakkel Blood Wolf drops two kinds of harnesses, the Crested Blood Wolf harness, which is the rare and doesn't work for the quest, and the Blood Wolf harness, which is the quest item.<BR>Good luck with the quest,<BR>Robyn Goodfellow<BR>52 druid Prexus <BR>Quantos<BR>Registered User<BR>(1/17/01 8:17:23 am)<BR>Reply<BR><BR>Re: Make sure you get the correct harness<BR>Just a small update to the quest...<BR>Once you hand the harness to the BM a lower level Grakl and Fergul will spawn infront of the fort. You CAN pull the green Fergul... only Grakl needs to be infront of the fort when the BM gets there ( I suggest harmony on Grakl and pulling Fergul). Our team pull the Green Fergul to behind the fort and waited for the BM to attack Grakl. When she attacked Grakl the green Fergul despawned and the quest Fregul (blue) spawned in his spot. Casted a quick snare and it was just a matter of killing him to get the legs.<BR>yeno  <BR>Registered User<BR>(1/17/01 9:21:21 am)<BR>Reply<BR><BR>Re: Make sure you get the correct harness<BR>Got mine the other day..thanks for the tips!<BR>Only complaint is that it looks so ugly on wood elves!<BR>I feel like i'm the Lord of the Dance or something :\<BR>Oh well...sacrifice looks for the sake of uber lewtz! <IMG SRC="/boards/images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <BR>Lorian  <BR>Registered User<BR>(1/17/01 9:30:52 am)<BR>Reply<BR><BR>Re: Make sure you get the correct harness<BR>I got my dragon control harness last night.

He is located in the Great Divide. You go through the wurm tunnel to the other side then go right and you will see his tent. In order to receive the quest you have to have high amiable (so I am told). In order to DO the quest. I myself did not hail him. I just found out what to do and then handed him the stuff. After he gives you the quest he wants you to get him a Blood wolf harness which you can get off of a blood wolf. It has to say blood wolf harness and not crested Blood Wolf harness. You can find the bloods wolfs by the wizzie spires in the same zone. If you cannot find them then you have to kill some Drakkel Dire wolfs untill a blood wolf spawns. After you get the harness goto Crystal Caverns in the Eastern Wastes. Kill any orc in the zone untill you get a bottle of Karsinic Acid or go kill the queen untill you get her scepter. Goto Erdarf Restil in Thurgardin. He is in a bar near the Temple which is past the bank. Just go down the path and the first building to the left and he is sitting at the bar. Give him the acid or scepter and he will give you a gem that looks like a white crystal ball. Go back to Voresh the Hunter and give him the gem and the harness he will give you a control harness. Go find the broodmother in the shardwurm caves. At this point it would be good to have some friends at the giant fort to make sure that no one is close to it because when you give the control harness to the broodmother two named giants Fergul and Grakl will walk out of the fort and stand out front. The broodmother will come to the fort and start to kill Grakl. Fergul will then despawn and immediatly respawn and start to run to the zone. Follow him a ways and then snare him and proceed to kill him then loot the leggings<BR>Geldin<BR>54th Wanderer<BR>The Rathe <BR>Goldmund TargaRi<BR>Registered User<BR>(1/17/01 12:33:46 pm)<BR>Reply<BR>Quest still works after the patch<BR>Logged last night in the broodmother's cave, logged back in today and there she was.  I've seen the quest run twice now, and both times the broodmother became Fergul's pet after she killed the other giants.  This time she didn't, so perhaps Verant fixed that portion of the quest?  Anyway, I brought a 53 wizard along just in case, but she really wasn't needed.  I got him down halfway with maybe a bub and a half of mana gone (/em kisses his es vambs) and had no problems with spells sticking.  This is an incredible quest for the effort involved... kudos to Verant on a job well done.<BR>--<BR>-Rye </FONT><BR></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR="#f7f5e6"><TD nowrap align="left">&nbsp;</TD><TD><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp<a href="/boards/bb_profile.php?mode=view&user=221"><img src="/boards/images/profile.gif" border=0 alt="View Profile of Flaim"></a>
