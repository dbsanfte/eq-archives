<hr><h2>A noted fact is that Sobe Silvertree was the first of our kind to accomplish this tedious task<br>
</h2><img src="http://people.ne.mediaone.net/sobe1/al_sobe.jpg" align="top" width="250" height="300"><hr>
<p>1. Find <b>Telin Darkforest </b>in Burning Woods.&nbsp; He will be located in
the Northwest corner of the zone.&nbsp; Ask him &quot;<b>What Action?</b>&quot; and you
will recieve this note:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="wornnote.jpg" width="380" height="151"></p>
<p align="center">(If he does not respond to you then your faction must be
raised.&nbsp; This can be done through the muffin quest in Freeport.&nbsp; Find <b>Pandos
Flintside</b> in West freeport in the Hogcaller's Inn.&nbsp; Hand hand him 4
muffins at a time.&nbsp; These muffins can be purchased from <b>Pincia Brownloe</b>
near the Theater of Tranquility in West Freeport as well.&nbsp; Even
if you are KOS to guards you can still do this as the muffin man is not near any
guards.)</p>
<p align="left">2. Find <b>Faelin Bloodbriar</b> in Greater Faydark.&nbsp; She
will be located around the northern part of the zone just west of Crushbone.&nbsp;
Faelin spawns at Pos 1500 Pos 500 and then runs in a circular pattern around
that location.&nbsp; She has one orc pawn as a placeholder.&nbsp; The
placeholder is on a 8 minute timer.&nbsp; Hand her the note and you will recieve this ring:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="ring.jpg" width="317" height="133"></p>
<p align="left">3. Find <b>Giz X'Tin Kithikor</b> in Kithicor forrest.&nbsp; He
can be found roaming along the path anywhere in the zone.&nbsp; I recommend
doing this in the day time as there are many high levels mobs at night.&nbsp; Hand him the
ring and you will recieve this coin:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="dmcoin.jpg" width="318" height="131"></p>
<p align="center">(Note: After you hand in the ring a lvl 50 Dark elf reaver
will spawn but you can flee from the zone without worries if you are sowed or
wolf-formed.&nbsp; It is not necessary to kill the reaver and only causes a
faction hit that might prevent you from running this part of the quest
again.&nbsp; If this does occur you can have a enchanter charm him and you will
then be able to turn in your item.)</p>
<p align="left">4.&nbsp; Find <b>Telin Darkforest</b> in Burning Woods
again.&nbsp; Hand him the coin and he will hand you back this coin:</p>
