  The Unkempt Warders Vol. II</strong><br>
  <br>
  A generation would pass before the elves of Tunaria would find the majestic 
  redwood forest. When the day arrived that a small band of scouts from the 
  Elddar Forest found the untouched beauty of this rugged wilderness, the human 
  nomads reacted as the Gihjna had greeted their ancestors'. The elves were not 
  receptive to the warm welcome that the humans extended, all but one - an elven 
  druid by the name of Wegadas. He was curious about the human settlers, and 
  even more curious to find that there were no man-made structures to 
  deteriorate the life force of the forest that he felt so strongly.<br>
  <br>
  Wegadas accepted the humans' hospitality and despite the language barrier 
  separating them, Wegadas quickly learned that these humans lived in harmony 
  with the forest, and likely had for some time. Their intense geographic 
  knowledge of the region was precise and what little bit Wegadas had to 
  observe, he took note of the harmony in which the humans shared with their 
  habitat. He was reminded much of the primordial elves - in the times before 
  Takish'Hiz and the establishment of the great empire his people had come to 
  be.<br>
  <br>
  Wegadas' elven companions were entranced with the dank, gloomy treasure they 
  had found. They were lured by the gentle song of the forests' spirit, a song 
  that any elf's spirit would easily hear, and bewitched by the purity and 
  strength of the uncorrupted and untouched spiritual life and strength of the 
  wood.<br>
  <br>
  After a day of intense scouting and brief interaction with the peaceful human 
  tribe, the elves reunited with their brother and spoke of their need to have 
  this forest for the Takish'Hiz Empire. Wegadas spoke out against his fellow 
  elves, he did not with to drive the humans from their home, for they live with 
  it in a way parallel to the elves' own cultural ways. He felt that the humans 
  could be brought to the ways of the elves and the forest could, with the aid 
  of the Elven Empire, thrive on its own and remain the pure, emerald jewel of 
  wilderness that they stood within. There was no need to leave this home from 
  the tribe, for they lived only in harmony with the wild and balance of nature.<br>
  <br>
  The superior in the group, a wanderer by the name of Kuvriathan, objected to 
  Wegadas' argument and sent (the) him back to Takish'Hiz with instructions to 
  report their discovery. The druid departed his party's side obediently, but 
  did not leave the forest boundaries.<br>
  <br>
  The elves then tried to herd the humans out of this forest in attempt to 
  cleanse it of the tribal presence and the taint they believed the humans would 
  inevitably bring - for these elves had seen the fledgling foundation of the 
  eastern costal cities and knew the destruction this race was capable of on a 
  whim. The wary Gihjna and Lujien immediate(ly) interfered, having watched the 
  elves since their arrival. Unsuspecting of the fierce and powerful guardians 
  of the woodland, the elves were taken unaware. All but one of the elven party 
  were destroyed - Wegadas.<br>
  <br>
  When the Lujien came for him, he presented himself unarmed and willingly, 
  despite the human pleas for him to go and not incur the wrath of the guardians 
  that had allowed them haven in the woods. The Lujien halted their advancement 
  when they saw the plight of their accepted human guests to spare the elf's 
  life.<br>
  <br>
  It was their pack leader, and elder Lujien warrior known to the human tribe as 
  Udos-Ehai Digowa (Fang of the Shadow in the common tongue), that approached 
  Wegadas and sunk his great maw into the elf's shoulder, but did not kill him. 
  The Lujien spoke in voiceless words to the elf, a conversation that would 
  later be written in the Writ of the Wild, a sacred text that dictates the 
  history and code of the Unkempt Warders.</font></p>
