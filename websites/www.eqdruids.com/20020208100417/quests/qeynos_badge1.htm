      <span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Verdana; font-weight:700">You
      say, 'Hail, Vegalys Keldrane'<br>
      <br>
      Vegalys Keldrane says 'Greetings to you, citizen. By order of the Council
      of Qeynos I have been given the duty of apprehending the individuals
      [responsible] for unleashing this terrible plague upon the people and the
      lands of Antonius Bayle. The more I look into this matter, the more I come
      to find that this will be no easy task.<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'what responsible ?'<br>
      <br>
      Vegalys Keldrane says 'The plague unleashed upon the Plains of Karana is
      the work of the followers of Bertoxxulous. Those responsible belong to
      group known as the Bloodsabers though there were others involved as well.&nbsp;
      Some time back, they launched a plot to overthrow Antonius Bayle and our
      ruling<br>
      council. Their [plan] failed.<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'what plan ?'<br>
      <br>
      Vegalys Keldrane says 'Their plan was to unleash a plague so deadly and
      virulent that it would wipe out all life from here to Highpass Hold. They
      planned to brand themselves and their foul allies with a rune that would
      have rendered them immune to the effects of this plague. From that point
      they would have been able to simply walk in, easily defeat the weakened
      stragglers and declare themselves the rulers of this kingdom by default.
      But they were [careless].<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'how they were careless ?'<br>
      <br>
      Vegalys Keldrane says 'The sudden influx of scoundrels and loathsome
      individuals was our first tip off. They required a rather enormous number
      of supplies, materials and manpower to construct the ornate altars, craft
      and enchant their runed branding irons and supply their armies with the
      weapons<br>
      needed for the cleanup work afterward. They needed to rely upon [outside
      help].<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'what outside help ?'<br>
      <br>
      Vegalys Keldrane says 'They mostly chose to hire bandits and brigands who
      are foolishly more concerned with immediate profits than the long-term
      effects of their actions. But once they knew we were on to them they even<br>
      started hiring some of the more 'civil' gnolls, if there is such a thing.
      Gnolls tend to be easy to push around, stupid, and they work very cheaply.
      They knew their time was short and they were desperate. Choosing to work
      with untrustworthy, lazy scoundrels caused the whole thing to begin to<br>
      [unravel], praise Rodcet!<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'what about unravel ?'<br>
      <br>
      Vegalys Keldrane says 'Their workers were careless. Aside from noticing
      the unsavory element in our city, our citizens began to run across many of
      the strange items and materials that were being trafficked into our city
      en masse. It was at that point that the citizens began to [complain] quite<br>
      loudly about all of this.<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'what complain ?'<br>
      <br>
      Vegalys Keldrane says 'Obviously, they questioned the meaning behind these
      events and rightfully so. They were frightened much as they are now. I
      admit, I was remiss in my duties for not noticing it sooner. One of the<br>
      biggest complainers during this time was a man by the name of [Earron
      Huntlan], proprietor of the famed Lion's Mane tavern. Though he is just a
      simple merchant, he did us a great service.<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'who is Earron Huntlan ?'<br>
      <br>
      Vegalys Keldrane says 'Earron is quite a character. He gets all kinds of
      travelers stopping by his inn for a drink or whatever other business. His
      patrons started telling stories of being mugged and harassed by these<br>
      loathsome individuals in the very streets of our fair city. Of course, he
      was concerned. So he became a kind of advocate for this cause, ringing the
      [alarm] bell as it were. I admit, at first I did not believe the<br>
      conspiracy. I simply could not believe it was all happening under our
      nose.<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'what alarm ?'<br>
      <br>
      Vegalys Keldrane says 'Well, he succeeded in whipping the populace into a
      frenzy. He even got the famous wizard Al'Kabor to help him out by
      determining the nature of the strange items many of our citizens were
      finding. Getting that man to do anything not directly related to his
      research is not an easy thing to accomplish either. Needless to say, at<br>
      that point I saw the truth and the Prime Healer forgive me for not seeing
      it sooner. Were it not for the investigations and general outcry of
      [concerned citizens], we might not be standing here talking today.<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'what concerned citizens ?'<br>
      <br>
      Vegalys Keldrane says 'Yes, it was citizens like you that helped to save
      Qeynos that day. We uncovered their plot, captured the man who was in
      charge and put him to death. Of course, the Bloodsabers retaliated and
      using their incomplete research still managed to unleash the plague we
      face now.<br>
      Though devastating in its own right, you must admit it is rather mild
      compared<br>
      to what it might have been. I thank you for your interest. Perhaps you
      would be willing to [help] me?<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'I am willing to help you'<br>
      <br>
      Vegalys Keldrane says 'Excellent! The more I learn from my investigators
      the more I find that these Bloodsabers have stretched their tendrils of
      influence all throughout our beloved city. Nevertheless, we are committed
      to exposing these fiends once and for all. Perhaps you would like to
      become an [investigator]?<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'I would like to become an investigator'<br>
      <br>
      Vegalys Keldrane says 'Very well then, Durix . We will not allow just
      anyone<br>
      to wear the official Investigator's Badge and please forgive me. . . But
      it is hard to tell where one's loyalties lie these days. If you are truly
      [serious] then there is a duty you must perform first to show you are<br>
      on the side of Antonius Bayle, the council and the good people Qeynos.<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'I am truly serious'<br>
      <br>
      Vegalys Keldrane says 'There is a guard by the name of Robbie Shilster
      that patrols the Northern Plains of Karana. He is allied with our enemies
      and completely corrupt. He is flagrant in his trafficking of contraband<br>
      goods. His orders are to guard the great wooden bridge to stave off the
      insect<br>
      swarms. But our investigators report that he simply stands to the side and
      watches as the swarm rolls through. You are to execute this man for his
      treason and bring me his helm. Then, we will talk.<br>
      <br>
      Go North Karana and go north of the wooden bridge, near the wall. Find
      Guard Shilster and kill him and loot a Cracked Corrupt Guard Helm.<br>
      <br>
      Run back to Qeynos<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'Hail, Vegalys Keldrane'<br>
      <br>
      Vegalys Keldrane says 'Thank you for bringing this person to justice.
      Please<br>
      read this manual very, VERY carefully. Commit it to memory. We do
      everything strictly by the book. We are a people of law and order and I
      simply won't tolerate a breach of protocol. Investigators are expected to
      accurately report findings, are authorized to issue warrants and to
      notarize<br>
      official documents for all lands under the jurisdiction of Antonius Bayle
      and the council. I sincerely hope you can earn your Investigator's Badge.<br>
      <br>
      Your faction standing with AntoniusBayle got better.<br>
      Your faction standing with GuardsofQeynos got better.<br>
      Your faction standing with RingofScale got worse.<br>
      Your faction standing with KaneBayle got worse.<br>

      You gain experience!!<br>
      <br>
      Go to South Qeynos. At a tree south of the Lions Mane tavern you will meet
      an investigator in a yellow robe. Give him the book.<br>
      <br>
      an investigator says 'Grouping with Durix'<br>
      an investigator says 'Very well, let's get to work. I assume you have read
      the briefing and committed it to memory. This is how you will be tested. I
      shall play the part of student and you shall play the master who directs
      me. I promise I won't make it easy on you either, we want only the best.<br>
      We'll see how you do and then I'll decide if you are worthy to wear the
      badge or not.<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'where is the first suspect ?'<br>
      <br>
      an investigator says 'The first suspect was last seen near the shop called
      Fireprides.<br>
      (Its the armor store near the bank)<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'follow me'<br>
      <br>
      an investigator says 'Following Master.'<br>
      <br>
      (The investigator follows you like a pet but the pathing of S Qeynos is
      VERY buggy so you need to wait and go very slowly of you want the
      investigator to really follow you. Each time you ask for a confession, you
      have to ask the investigator to follow you again.<br>
      <br>
      Look for Riley Shplots<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'are you a member of the Bloodsabers ?'<br>
      <br>
      Riley Shplots shakes visibly and says, 'Oh, no. I knew this would happen
      one day. Please don't hurt me! I had very little to do with this plague,
      though it is quite a nice one, you must admit. I was just a courier. I'll
      come quietly. I don't want any trouble. My small contribution to the glory
      of Bertoxxulous has already been given but I certainly don't want to go to<br>
      meet him just yet!'<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'give me a confession document '<br>
      an investigator says 'Here you are.<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'summon a guard'<br>
      <br>
      Guard Sylus says 'Come along, prisoner.<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'where is the second suspect ?'<br>
      <br>
      an investigator says 'The second suspect was sighted below the Grounds of
      Fate. (under the arena, near the cells)<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'follow me'<br>
      <br>
      Look for Willie Garrote<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'are you a member of the Bloodsabers ?'<br>
      <br>
      Willie Garrote says 'A Bloodsaber? Of course I'm not, don't be ridiculous!<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'give me a confession document'<br>
      <br>
      an investigator says 'Here you are.<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'summon a guard'<br>
      <br>
      Guard Sylus says 'Come along, fiend. We haven't far to go.<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'where is the third suspect ?'<br>
      <br>
      an investigator says 'The last suspect has been known to hang around that
      low life known as Raz the Rat. (near the docks, on the shore)<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'follow me'<br>
      <br>
      an investigator says 'Following Master.'<br>
      <br>
      Look for Donally Stultz<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'are you a Bloodsaber?'<br>
      <br>
      Donally Stultz says 'Of course I'm a Bloodsaber, you fool! I've just
      returned from the Plains of Karana where I was reveling in the glory of
      the Plaguebringer. Now then, since I see that this foolish investigator is
      with you, I suppose you want me to sign a confession document or something
      like that? Well, let's have it then!<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'give me a confession document'<br>
      <br>
      an investigator says 'Here you are.<br>
      <br>
      Donally Stultz crumples the document into a ball, throws it to the ground
      and spits in your face, yelling, 'You are a fool if you really believe I
      would sign such a thing. Prepare to die!'<br>
      <br>
      Kill him and loot his head.<br>
      <br>
      Give the investigator the two confessions and the one head.<br>
      <br>
      an investigator says 'You have done our city a great service and helped to
      bring several criminals to justice this day! Wear this Investigator's
      Badge with pride! Speak again with Vegalys Keldrane, he may have
      information about [advancing further] in rank.<br>
      <br>
      Your faction standing with AntoniusBayle got better.<br>
      Your faction standing with GuardsofQeynos got better.<br>
      Your faction standing with RingofScale got worse.<br>
      Your faction standing with KaneBayle got worse.<br>
      Your faction standing with MerchantsofQeynos got better.<br>
      <br>
      You get your Investigator badge<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'I want to advance further in rank'<br>
      <br>
      Vegalys Keldrane says 'At this point, I am mainly in need of loyal and
      trustworthy investigators. I must first gather information on who these
      people are and exactly how far their influences stretch. However, once I
      begin to implement the next phase of this operation, you may be able to
      assist us once again if you prove to be talented enough. For now, simply
      continue to observe and report.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
