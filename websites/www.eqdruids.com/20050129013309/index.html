                familiar faces of Firiona Vie and her nemesis Lanys T’Vyl return 
                to find themselves at the forefront of the events. Unbeknownst 
                to them, a dark influence has seeped into the world of Norrath 
                causing new tensions to arise and conflicts to intensify as the 
                dawn of a new age emerges. The Age of War is upon the people of

                Halas and Lavastorm as you seek out the Nest, the ancestral 
                birthplace of all dragons, long sealed away and hidden from the 
                eyes of Norrath. But beware, if the Nest is exposed too early 
                during the Brood Dawn, all dragons and their eggs will be cursed 
                for eternity and death will storm down on all Norrathian's not

                Hey guys,<br>
                <br>
                We've looked at the issues that players have brought up with the 
                epic 1.5/2.0 effects and took those into consideration when 
                making these modifications. We’re looking specifically at 
                effects currently. Here is the list of changes that will be 
                occurring to the epic weapon effects: <br>

                1) The click effect will be a 6/3 minute recast for the 1.5/2.0. 
                The duration will be changed from 1 minute to 30 seconds, and 
                the spell hit limit will be increased to 20. 30% mod for the 1.5 
                and 50% mod for the 2.0. Resist adjustment on proc will be set 
                to -300 chromatic<br>
                2) No changes to the focus effect. <br>

                Hello. Having looked into the Fironia Vie quest, I can only say 
                it is ENTIRELY onesided for goody goody characters, and has no 
                value or use to me as an evil necro. Is there any part of the 
                quest where I can see that that dispicable elven witch STAYS 
                locked up??? Why on earth would I want her released, and in 
                fact, why would app. 1/2 of ALL characters be left out of this 
                quest?<br>

                The Firiona Vie quests that were running earlier this week are 
                just the start of things. There will be plenty more to come in 
                the next month and lots of opportunity for evil characters to 
                ply their trade as well.<br>

                Dragons of Norrath Feature List<br>
                <br>
                Overview<br>
                <br>
                A series of events has transpired across the world of Norrath 
                and the familiar faces of Firiona Vie and her nemesis Lanys 
                T’Vyl return to find themselves at the forefront of the events. 
                Unbeknownst to them, a dark influence has seeped into the world 
                of Norrath causing new tensions to arise and conflicts to 
                intensify as the dawn of a new age emerges. The Age of War is 
                upon the people of Norrath and heroes return in this ultimate,

                all dragons, long sealed away and hidden from the eyes of 
                Norrath. But beware, if the Nest is exposed too early during the 
                Brood Dawn, all dragons and their eggs will be cursed for 
                eternity and death will storm down on all Norrathian's not in 
                their service.<br>
                <br>
                Featuring new lands with enhanced graphics, bold new storylines,

                Foraging for Cash<br>
                <br>
                So you are always broke, you don’t play in the high-end game, 
                and you need a reliable way to make some plat? Well I’m here to 
                tell you foraging is an easy way to make a few thousand plat a 
                week. Now don’t tell me foraging sucks, you can’t make any cash 
                doing that, cause what I say is bull hocky. I make at least 10K 
                a week from my foraged goods, the trick is know what, how and 
                when to forage, and that my friend is what I am here to tell 
                you!!!<br>
                <br>
                First lets start with the HOWS;<br>
                <br>
                Foraging is a skill inherent to a few races and classes, and 
                certain Race/class combos are more inherent then others. Lets 
                start with what works best and why, the lists below describes 
                the various races and classes that get foraging and what there 
                skills can be.</font></p>

                Natures Balance Spell Broken? Can someone please check?<br>
                <br>
                RacerY 11.09.04<br>
                <br>
                Natures Balance our level 69 spell seems broken. Well if not 
                broken realy out of balance.<br>
                <br>
                Rangers get Annul Magic at level 61. Annul costs 75mana, casts 
                in 4 seconds, recasts in 6, has 200 range and strips up to 2 
                effects.<br>
                <br>
                Rangers get Natures Balance at level 69. NB costs 100 mana, 
                casts in 3seconds(1.8 with level effects), recasts in 12, and 
                strips up to 1 effect.<br>
                <br>
                Now with 8 levels of differnce and it being our last level 69 
                spell I expected somethig special. Like it would only strip the 
                spells we would want to have striped from our target. The buffs 
                and not the debuffs. In fact in beta it was suggested here that 
                whats what made this spell special.<br>
                <br>
                That said having use the spell on the live servers I cant see 
                any differnce between annul and natures balance. Cast snare on a 
                mob, then cast Natures balance, poof there goes snare. Cast 
                Natures balance on self poof there goes a buff.<br>
                <br>
                Right now I cant see how this spell is any differnt then a 
                slightly faster casting, higher mana, longer recast, weaker 
                version of Annul Magic.<br>

                Changes to Nature's Balance will be going live on 12/15/04...<br>
                <br>
                This spell will only strip a beneficial buff from their target. 
                This is a new type of spell specific to rangers.<br>

                Holy Forge - When Is It Going To Be Fixed?<br>
                <br>
                PerchInDaSkillet 12.01.04<br>
                <br>
                Anyone caught word on when Holyforge is expected to be fixed? I 
                have been gettin some great crippling blows in the 900's with 
                Holyforge, but maybe one or two slays max throughout the 
                duration. Slay Undead has certainly lost its lustre of what it 
                once was. With the lack of Undead content in OOW, paladins are 
                needing some fixing.<br>
                <br>
                Remember when you could pop Holyforge and slay undead like a 
                champ? Those days have long past for some time. You figure since 
                the undead in the past couple expansions has been so small that 
                giving Paladins back their old Holyforge wouldn't cause too much 
                drama in game. The reset time on Holyforge is also over one hour 
                and last for like a few minutes. The only decent discipline we 
                have that really deosn't work. Any ideas? I have read some of 
                the parses on paladinsofnorrath.com and complaints about this 
                for some time. I am just curious as to what is the hold up on 
                fixing this issue.<br>

                Hello Paladins,<br>
                <br>
                I have news about Holyforge!! Holyforge was not working properly 
                due to a change that was made to the Slay Undead AA.<br>
                <br>
                Holyforge was not corrected to work with Slay Undead when this 
                change was made. This issue has been corrected and will go live 
                in the 12/15 update. Holyforge will now increase your chance to 
                slay undead, and if you the Slay Undead AA you will have an even 
                greater chance of a slay with Holyforge.<br>

                We are STUCK. The discussion on how do do the combine(s) after 
                collecting the medals, clay and blood has stagnated. We've been 
                trying random things for a couple weeks now without any success. 
                The lack of any clues as to what we should combine has strangled 
                any progress toward epic 2.0. I don't really think it's a matter 
                of anyone just sitting on their secrets, because the beastlord 
                communitee is overall a very helpful and supportive group and 
                who participated vigorously in researching 1.5. If nothing else 
                we also love to brag and if anyone had completed this combine 
                they would be announcing it to all creation so the rest of us 
                could kneel in reverence.<br>
                <br>
                Devs, we really could use a clue. Something<br>

                Developer's Update 11/30/04<br>
                <br>
                Tiorpat Tornwing event broken on live.<br>
                <br>
                NicholBolas 11.16.04<br>
                <br>
                Tiorpat Tornwing is a mob in The Ruined City of Dranik zone.<br>
                <br>
                He has a zone-wide emote.<br>
                <br>
                He's targetable but cannot be attacked.<br>
                <br>
                He has a bunch of red-shirted friends around him, and a bunch of 
                blue-shirted friends across the path from him. He talks to these 
                guys in the zone-wide emotes from time to time.<br>
                <br>
                Supposedly there is a script to kill him. First kill all the 
                red-shirt friends, then you can attack him and the blue-shirt 
                friends activate and help him in the battle during the fight.<br>
                <br>
                However this is bugged. We started killing red-shirt people with 
                our guild. Killed all but one of them. This last one was 
                targetable but not attackable, similar to Tiorpat Tornwing. So 
                we figured the script was somehow either broken or failed, so 
                we'd come back the next day and see if we could try it again.<br>
                <br>
                Well the next day... all the blue-shirt mobs were gone, all the 
                red-shirt mobs but one were gone, and the last red-shirt guy was 
                still there, targetable, un-attackable. Same with Tiorpat. So we 
                thought hmm.. guess maybe it takes longer than a day to reset 
                the event.<br>
                <br>
                It's been TWO WEEKS now that the event has not been possible to 
                complete. It's been two weeks that the event has not been 
                possible to re-start or re-attempt in any way. Clearly bugged. 
                When you fail at Emperor Ssraeshza, it's not a week to 
                re-attempt the script. Same with Cursed cycle. Same with Coirnav. 
                So what's so special about this guy?<br>
                <br>
                This is a problem because the quest drop for the OoW breastplate 
                -- Dragorn Elder Scepter -- comes from Tiorpat. So people can't 
                do this quest because the script for this mob is broken.<br>
                <br>
                Please help us figure out why the event cannot be finished and 
                why the event is not resetting to allow people to re-start the 
                event if they failed it the first time. </font></p>

                If we are going to have a bazaar system that basically requires 
                you to stand at your booth all day with your pc running to sell 
                things . Then there should not be a time out ... i have been 
                disconnected repeatedly while trying to let my trader stand in 
                the bazaar..<br>
                <br>
                I would suggest .. a system like star wars galaxies.. if it is 
                possible .. put your items up on say a bulletin board... it 
                sells the money goes into your bank account.. no more having to 
                let your pc run for days on end .. no more dissconnected trader 
                when you come in to check on your progress...<br>
                <br>
                what do you all think .. and is there someplace else i should be 
                mentioning this a dev board perhaps ...<br>

                First off, thank you for the laugh Iceblossom<br>
                <br>
                On the subject of changing the Bazaar system, I am pasting from 
                last week's HOC chat...<br>
                <br>
                Lungvinofsaryrn - hello i would like to ask the trader system on 
                everquest online adventures is really good and i think it would 
                be a vast improvement over bazaar trader as anyone can sell 
                stuff even while there not online it would be good for us 
                players still on dial up. Is there any way to implement this or 
                are you even going to consider it?<br>
                <br>
                Lyndro - None of us are familiar with the system from EQoA, 
                however we don't have any plans currently to change our bazaar 
                system. <br>

                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 9pt">
                Here's some helpful info for 50-60 Druids who like to charm 
                fight for good xp. I don't consider this an exploit because its 
                done in correlation with how SoE revamped mob &quot;super-regen&quot; a 
                while back - its just now we can make that work to our 
                advantage. I stumbled on this accidentally so I thought I would 
                share it with other druids. This guide will assume you have 
                basic pet charm knowledge and experience, so if you don't, 
                practice on some green cons in the Karanas first.<br>
                <br>
                In most EQ zones now, mobs will start to regenerate at an 
                incredible rate once their aggro list is cleared or once the 
                distance between them and the person(s) attacking them is too 
                far. Thus if you're beating on a mob and start getting your tail 
                handed to you, you can evac (egress) somewhere else in the zone 
                and clear the hate list. But if you find that mob again, it will 
                probably be at 100% health again.<br>
                <br>
                So what does this regeneration law have to do with animal 
                charming? Keep reading...<br>

                Ferocity Line of AA's Broken?<br>
                <br>
                Draxxalon 11.10.04<br>
                <br>
                I originally started to parse this, just to see what sort of 
                effect it might be having on my DPS.<br>
                <br>
                After not being sure about the results through general use, I 
                set up some sterile test cases.<br>
                <br>
                I did a 5 hour parse of constant swinging, with no buffs, 
                against a stationary non-combatant mob, with ferocity 2.<br>
                <br>
                About a week later, after getting ferocity 3, I did another 4 
                hour parse against the same mob.<br>
                <br>
                Using EQCompanion, and YALP, I got almost the same dps between 
                the two parses (within 0.05dps, fero3 came in a tiny bit lower, 
                the difference is small enough that I would say that it didnt 
                change), and the EXACT same distribution of attacks (using 
                EQCompanion) for 1/2/3/4/4+ attacks. Exact same gear (dual 
                wielding velium inlaid claws to keep the delays identical on 
                each hand too) each time, and exact same buffs (none).<br>
                <br>
                While I wasn't expecting much of a change, I was expecting some.<br>
                <br>
                Is this known to the Dev Team?<br>
                <br>
                I can post more info, if its of any help. I'd do more tests 
                without Fero1, and with Fero1, but I didnt think about doing it 
                until I had Fero2 for this.<br>

                I sent this along to QA to check out yesterday and they ran some 
                tests... I am pasting the response with their results below...<br>
                <br>
                -- Ferocity increases the chance of double attacks, so it seems 
                that a much better way to actually check results would be number 
                of swings and not DPS.<br>
                <br>
                Checking number of swings, over the course of 15 minutes there 
                was a noticeable difference between ferocity 2 and ferocity 3 
                with 3 coming out ahead by a good margin.<br>
                <br>
                This AA appears to be working correctly from any way I can see.

                Collision Update - 11/5/04<br>
                <br>
                Grumbuk-Dev 11.05.04<br>

                <br>
                Hello,<br>
                <br>
                I'm happy to be able to let you know that more time has been 
                spent recently solving some of the remaining collision bugs. For 
                those wondering why this hasn't happened sooner, the main reason 
                is that after the DX9 collision system became relatively stable 
                we wanted to just leave it alone for a bit - partly because we 
                wanted to avoid risking unexpected bugs during the Omens 
                beta/release timeframe, but it was also (mostly) so we could 
                become more certain about the nature of the remaining problems 
                in the collision &amp; movement system. Now that enough time has 
                passed for the existing problems in the system to become fairly 
                well identified and understood, I've been able to start working 
                through them. Some turned out to be pretty easy to fix, some not 
                so easy, but the good news is that there have been some fixes to 
                the collision system.<br>
                <br>
                Here are the things that I believe are fixed with a brief 
                explanation of what was going on with them for the curious.<br>
                <br>
                *** Please note that some of these changes haven't even hit Test 
                yet but will be there soon, probably early next week. ***<br>
                <br>
                ------------------------------<br>
                These two are closely related:<br>
                <br>
                * Getting out of water is much easier.<br>
                * Players standing on the lip of a cliff or ledge of some sort 
                would not slide off of it; this had the side effect of the 
                physics system getting confused and could cause a 20k fall bug 
                to occur.<br>
                <br>
                I haven't yet worked on the physics part of this problem (the 
                20k fall part; I intend to soon) but I did make changes that 
                cause the collision sphere for the player to properly slide 
                (deflect) off the edge of the surface they are not standing 
                directly on or otherwise directly colliding with - this should 
                make it near impossible to trigger the 20k fall bug. This 
                problem was directly related to why players had a hard time 
                getting out of water where the ledge to hop onto was a bit 
                higher that the player's collision sphere; basically, the 
                deflection of the sphere as you hit the edge of the land was 
                always perpendicular to the surface of the triangle. This means, 
                you hit the ledge and it just pushes you straight back instead 
                of letting you hit the edge of the ledge and bounce up via 
                deflection. I've tested all sizes of characters in halas, 
                shadowhaven, ssra, and in all cases it is much easier to get out 
                of the water. Shadowhaven has always been a little difficult to 
                get out of but based on what I remember of the DX8 engine it's 
                about the same now as it used to be. It's kind of an unusual 
                case because it really is quite a tall ledge to use to get out 
                of the water. I've asked about having something added to the 
                water there to make it a lot easier to get out of but I'm not 
                sure when/if that can be done.<br>
                <br>
                ------------------------------<br>
                * There were object instances in the game (ie one object that 
                appears many times, one example of a problem object is a vase 
                type object in drankcatacombsa) that would, when you walked over 
                them, cause the collision system to freak out usually causing 
                players to get tossed &amp; stuck into the ceiling.<br>
                <br>
                This was due to the original object being scaled so large from 
                the original size of the exported object (from the 3d editor) 
                that some of the math the collision system has to do was hitting 
                a precision problem with side effects that aren't worth going 
                into beyond saying it was just plain incorrect. The reproduction 
                of the bug was 100%, the fix was pretty straightforward, and I 
                am certain this is fixed. There have been sporadic reports about 
                players getting tossed into ceilings and sticking there and I 
                think this is what was causing it.<br>
                <br>
                -------------------------------<br>
                <br>
                These two are related.<br>
                * Mounts should no longer be dismissed when zoning<br>
                * Summoning mounts in certain places should no longer cause 
                players to fall through the world.<br>
                <br>
                These were both due to a pretty straightforward bug that solved 
                all the cases of these problems happening. There was a variable 
                that was being used for the floor elevation that was simply not 
                being updated before the mount check was being done. Once this 
                was changed I haven't seen or heard of these problems happening.<br>
                <br>
                -------------------------------<br>
                * The bounding radius of small races has been tuned<br>
                <br>
                There is a variable in the code that limits how short things are 
                allowed to become with respect to collision &amp; movement. This 
                value was simply too large, and was preventing gnomes from 
                entering small areas such as the huts in steamfont. I've tuned 
                this down to where it needs to be and so far it appears small 
                races can go where you would expect them to go. Click

                <br>
                I am so very glad to know that there are programmers who enjoy 
                helping the players to the point they spend extra time working 
                on these kinds of nice enhancements. You guys have done so many 
                nice extra things and they are all appreciated. And ignore the 
                silly people arguing against /melody, some people just can’t be 
                happy no matter how much you try to help them.<br>
                <br>
                If you find yourself looking for another project like that, 
                could you look into adding an auto-range attack, similar to 
                /melody? I find it really difficult to chat with my friends 
                while constantly pressing the range button. And that is a lot of 
                the reason I play, so I can goof off and have fun with all my EQ 
                buddies. Lol, so many people would be SO VERY happy if you make 
                an auto-range. Hehe, I’ll even name the hotkey I make using it 
                “Grumbuk Power.” We have asked for this before, but we realize 
                there are so many other things you programmers have to do. If it 
                is too much trouble to do, I understand. No worries.<br>
                <br>
                Thank you for your time, Asrayjr<br>

                Hi there.<br>
                <br>
                Speaking for myself only, I'd like to see auto-attack for ranged 
                weapons added to EverQuest. Clearly the community wants it or it 
                wouldn't be in the ranger's top-10 list. I don't personally see 
                why it should be a big deal to add. But that's just my opinion, 
                which isn't enough to make this happen because this sort of 
                thing requires several key people to agree that it's something 
                we want to do. I have raised the subject on several occasions in 
                the past couple weeks and hopefully the decision making folks 
                will come to a conclusion before too long.<br>
                <br>
                Stuff like this is important to get team discussion and 
                agreement on because it's easy for one person to overlook 
                potential problems (code and/or design) of the side effects of 
                what might otherwise appear to be a simple change, so I don't 
                mind waiting until people come to their own conclusions about it 
                we should do it.<br>
                <br>
                cheers<br>

                I will examine Antonica in two parts; even to describe Freeport 
                in complete detail would be an exhausting task. However, insofar 
                as it is possible to cover the entire continent systematically, 
                it is my goal here to do so. This Part V is a look at Eastern

                EverQuest is a vast game, and it keeps getting bigger - each 
                expansion brings new zones to explore, new places to go and new 
                things to see - not to mention new things to kill and new stuff 
                to take. Even between expansions, only a priveleged few have 
                learned the game well enough to get to and master the 
                out-of-the-way endgame zones. Sleeper's Tomb requires a drop 
                from named, Velious dragons; Vex Thal requires spending time in 
                ten different zones on Luclin; reaching the Plane of Time 
                requires having gone through virtually all of Planes of Power.<br>
                <br>
                My ambition with this paper is to lay out the geography of 
                EverQuest in the most intuitive manner possible. Those who have 
                been playing for awhile, who have many characters of higher or 
                lower level, and have a lot of play time, will know how to get 
                around. This guide is for all those who have had the experience 
                of being invited somewhere by a friend and been forced to

                Odus is the Westmost continent in the Old World, and is the home 
                of the dark-skinned and high-domed Erudite race. The Erudites, 
                in turn, hold the balance between the Kobolds of Clan Kolbok, 
                the Kerran cat-people of Kerra Isle and their mystical cousins 
                the Kejekans, in Stonebrunt Mountains. Offshore from the 
                Stonebrunt mountains, separated from the mainland by a misty and 
                turbulent sea, is the pirate haven called Broken Skull Rock.

                Omens of War Guild Tribute System<br>
                <br>
                The release of Omens of War added yet another interesting 
                feature to the game, a guild tribute system. Now this system 
                works in a very similar fashion to the regular tribute system 
                unveiled upon the Gates of Discord release. (More information 
                here) This article will serve as a walk through for those guild 
                leaders and officers interested in using this system.<br>
                <br>
                To begin we need to make sure your guild understands what guild 
                tribute is and how to activate/deactivate certain tributes for 
                themselves. This is important for everybody to know because 
                certain tributes such as spell haste and flowing thought aren't 
                much use for Monks and Warriors. To combat this uselessness and 
                avoid unnecessary tribute point spending each guild member has 
                the opportunity to &quot;opt out&quot; of any tribute available to them. 
                Also keep in mind that tribute counts towards &quot;worn&quot; effects 
                such as regeneration, mana regen, attack, etc. If a guild member 
                has already reached his or her worn cap for that particular 
                effect the tribute will do them no good. Now in order for 
                members to be able to opt out of guild tribute they will have to 
                pay a short visit to Guild Tribute Master Chaunna Graice in the 
                library in Plane of Knowledge. The Guild Tribute Master is 
                located in the top floor of the library and is easily found 
                using the &quot;find&quot; feature in game.<br>
                <br>
                Ok, now we have everybody opted out of the tributes that won't 
                benefit them, now what? Now we have to get some tribute points 
                so the guild can actually get something out of this system. 
                Contributions work the same way as regular tribute except 
                contributors have to have Omens of War enabled on their account. 
                From within guild manager (alt + g) there has been a &quot;tribute&quot; 
                tab added that allows members to see who contributed what and 
                when. This tab will also show what your status is for a certain 
                tribute. For more information, click

                Tip: Ailing Walrus of Siren's Grotto</font></b></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 9pt">With 
                the revamp of Siren's Grotto a few months back, several named 
                creatures had the possibility of spawning from regular 
                placeholders. For the unlucky few, this meant that they'd come 
                upon a named when travelling or evacuating across the zone. 
                While noticeably tougher than the non-named, they were largely 
                avoidable and manageable.<br>
                <br>
                With the introduction of the Omens of War Epic '2.0' Quests, an 
                additional named was placed in Siren's Grotto. Unfortunately for 
                anyone going to the ends of Velious, they've placed it very near 
                the Evac landing spot in Siren's Grotto.<br>
                <br>
                The level 65 'Ailing Walrus' now spawns frequently at the 'safe 
                spot' in Siren's Grotto, adjacent to the Western Wastes zoneline. 
                Since loading times vary, anyone evaccing or succoring across SG 
                may likely find themselves alone with this KOS beast, and will 
                arrive already being beaten by his 800+ melee attacks.<br>
                <br>
                Since the zone is relatively shallow, any tracker who belongs 
                there should have no problem checking whether it's up or not; so 
                at least the cautious may have warning. But warning may not be 
                enough if you're trying to get a small group to a Western 
                Wastes, Temple of Veeshan, or Dragon Necropolis encounter. In 
                fact, very few encounters in Velious include the post-PoP melee 
                output this mob flaunts. Many will be caught unprepared, many 
                will be killed; unless changes are made to this new spawn.<br>
                <br>
                Here's to hoping you're not among them!</font></p>

                Now, on the first line, put something along the lines of: &quot;Druid 
                Porting! To WC, NK, Toxx, BB. For donations!&quot; Put in whatever 
                locations you have ports for... High Dollar port locations are, 
                Cobalt Scar, Dreadlands, Skyfire Mountaints, Wakening Lands 
                (watch for the dragon Wuoshi). Now that you have your Shout 
                Social button, some good places to port FROM, are, the ones I 
                mentioned above, plus any hard to get out of locations...Lower 
                Guk, Most Dungeons, Kael, etc. And simply press your shout 
                social button when you are in a Porting mood. The normal price 
                people pay is anywhere from 10p-100p...Pick up 5 people in one 
                port, thats 50p-500p. Not bad. This method doesnt work as well 
                now with PoP, but people often like to be ported places that 
                dont have a book. Stoneburnt Mountaints for example. Also try 
                porting out of PoK. </font><br>

                Runes for Omen Spells 66-70</font></b></p>
                <p align="left">
                <font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 9pt">Runes for Omens 
                Spells<br>
                <br>
                There are five types of runes you can obtain through Omens Of 
                War to trade in for 66-70 spells.<br>
                <br>
                Here is what they are:<br>
                1) Minor Muramite Rune: Level 66 spell.<br>
                2) Lesser Muramite Rune: Level 67 spell.<br>
                3) Muramite Rune: Level 68 spell.<br>
                4) Greater Muramite Rune: Level 69 spell.<br>
                5) Glowing Muramite Rune: Level 70 spell.<br>
                <br>
                They are all turned into the same guy, he is SW of the zone in 
                to Dranik's Scar. His location is -1650,-40. (Basically, go 
                southwest and look for the red con mob).<br>
                <br>
                They all drop from various named, the higher level the named, 
                the greater the rune will be. Obviously, the level 69/70 spells 
                will drop off of raid-encounter type mobs.<br>
                <br>
                You will never receive a duplicate spell. You only will get a 
                spell you need from turn in.<br>
                <br>
                The port spells for Druid and Wizard are very easy to get. The 
                components will drop from random trash mobs in the Bloodfields 
                (crystals and parchments), and in Wall of Slaughter (blood and 
                parchments). You need 3 crystals/blood per 1 parchment for a 
                single spell.<br>
                <br>
                Enjoy!</font></p>

                The Priests of Discord in Norrath believe they have been granted 
                a gift. A unique knowledge has been bestowed upon them which 
                they believe was granted as a reward for preaching the way of 
                Discord. That gift, they claim, is the knowledge of a way to a 
                world that is enveloped by Discord itself -- an ethereal poison 
                that wreaks havoc and strife upon all it touches.<br>
                <br>
                Speak to a Priest of Discord to learn how to enter the World of 
                Kuua.<br>

                The Task System<br>
                -------------------<br>
                Only have a short time to play or are you waiting for a group or 
                raid? Immerse yourself in a Task. You can find Task Masters all 
                over Norrath. They can be found in most home cities as well as 
                in places like the East Commonlands, the Butcherblock Mountains, 
                Toxxulia Forest and the Swamp of No Hope. For the more daring 
                individuals, the most challenging tasks can be found by speaking 
                with Task Masters in the Dreadlands and the Overthere.<br>
                <br>
                You can open the task window by hitting Alt+Q and start enjoying 
                this new game-play style and enhancement to the EverQuest 
                experience.<br>
                <br>
                Be mindful of turning in task items in stacks, as with all 
                quests in EQ, please seperate the items before turning them in 
                for a reward.<br>

                Epic Weapons 2.0<br>

                items?<br>
                <br>
                Guild Tribute<br>
                -------------------<br>
                Omens of War expansion brings a new Guild Tribute system. This 
                system will allow guild members to donate items/cash for Tribute 
                points, and allow officers to select benefits that the entire 
                guild will receive, deducting the cost from the guild’’s tribute 
                pool.<br>
                <br>
                Guild Tribute is an extension of the tribute system introduced 
                in Gates of Discord and purchasers of either expansion, will be 
                able to reap the new benefits.<br>
                <br>
                Retail Claim Item<br>
                -------------------<br>
                Those of you who purchased the retail version of EverQuest: 
                Omens of War will need to use the /claim command in-game to 
                receive your in-game items. Enjoy!<br>
                <br>
                Select your title<br>
                -------------------<br>
                You can hit Shift+T to bring up the new Title selection UI which 
                will allow you to choose from the titles you have earned, 
                through AAs, levels or accomplishments, to be shown with your 
                character name in-game.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Voice Macros<br>
                -------------------<br>
                Using Ctrl+V will bring up the new Voice Macro UI. There you 
                will see a list of available voice macros as well as the options 
                of Play, Tell, Group and Raid. Selecting a macro and play will 
                play the macro for you only. Selecting a macro and using one of 
                the other options will send the voice macro to either a tell 
                (using the person you have targeted as the recipient), group or 
                raid.<br>
                <br>
                To create your own voice macros, make a sound file using the 
                same name as one of the existing voice macros, which can be 
                found in your EverQuest&gt;Voice&gt;Default directory and place it in 
                your EverQuest&gt;Voice&gt;User directory.<br>
                <br>
                You can create hot keys of your favorite Voice Macros by 
                selecting the macro you would like and clicking and holding on 
                the Tell, Raid or Group button until the icon appears on your 
                cursor.<br>
                <br>
                We hope you enjoy this new way to immerse yourself into the 
                EverQuest experience.<br>

                New Spell Slot<br>
                -------------------<br>
                For the first time in EQ, you can open up a new spell slot by 
                learning the Mnemonic Retention AA ability. 9 Spell slots! Wow, 
                Why I remember in the early days of EQ, we only had 8 spell 
                slots and we liked it. We cast spells all day, going uphill both 
                ways. You whippersnappers have it easy =)<br>
                <br>
                More Buff Slots<br>
                -------------------<br>
                If you find that you need more room for beneficial buffs on your 
                character, activate the Mystical Attuning AA and open up more 
                room in your buff slot window.<br>
                <br>
                Improved Customization for Graphics<br>
                -------------------<br>
                -There are now 3 sets of options (Spell, Environment, and 
                Actor). All 3 sets have similar options that affect each type of 
                particle. These options allow for more customization when

                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 9pt">
                <b>Shadow Knight PvP Guide</b><br>
                <br>
                Remember all direct damage spells on PvP servers do 2/3rds of 
                their normal damage.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Level 1-29:</b><br>
                <br>
                From level 1-9 you'll basically be a Warrior without kick and 
                with less hitpoints. Just hurry and make level 9 and get your 
                spells. The damage cap on weapons is very annoying during these 
                levels. From level 1-10 you'll be able to hit for 20 damage max. 
                Level 10-20 you'll be able to hit for 29 damage. Level 20-30 
                you'll be able to hit for approx. 60-70 damage. Always use your 
                ATK/AC drains during these levels. At level 15 you'll get your 
                first snare, this spell will always be usefull because it is 
                harder to resist. The lifetap you get is esentially worthless in 
                PvP. You'll always be better off just attacking with your 
                weapon.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Level 30-48:</b><br>
                <br>
                Finally the weapon damage cap will be gone and you should be 
                able to do some fearsome damage depending on your equipment of 
                course. You get a decent lifetap at level 30, it still leaves 
                something lacking but at least it's a heal. You get your first 
                Spear spell in these levels as well. Always keep your spears 
                memmed and chain cast them on your opponent. The spears combined 
                with the hard to resist Heat Blood line makes for some decent 
                spell damage. Your melee damage will put you over the top 
                though. Always drain STR/AC/ATK from people.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Level 49-55:</b><br>
                <br>
                These levels will further increase your DoT lines as well as 
                adding more Spears. Level 50 is the official end of the weapons 
                cap. You should do the Life Leach quest as it's a very nice 
                lifetap for these levels. If you choose not to do the quest 
                you'll be stuck with the 75dmg lifetap that will do 50dmg in PvP. 
                Gear at these levels all the way to 65 will be very important. 
                While SKs get some nice spells the damage you can do with a 
                weapon will always outdo it. You should get Run 3 as soon as you 
                can, this will help out alot in dungeons which is where you will 
                excel at PvP.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Level 56-59:</b><br>
                <br>
                Finally you'll get a real lifetap spell that does 226dmg and 
                doesn't require a quest to get. Unfortunatly once you make level 
                57(TZ/VZ) or 61 (RZ) you'll be in range to level 65s. This is a 
                very hard time to level as a melee on a PvP server. If you're 
                ever rooted/snare chain cast your lifetaps on your opponent. 
                Your best chance is to stay alive long enough to get some melee 
                in and make them waste their mana on your HPs/Resists/Lifetaps.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Level 60-65:</b><br>
                <br>
                You get a very nice selection of DoTs in these levels. Always 
                stack as many DoTs on your opponent as you can. Just run up and 
                hit them and while your sword is delaying cast your DoT. You get 
                a 400dmg lifetap as well, if you can grind some AAs and get 
                Spell Casting Fury 3 this lifetap can put some BIG dents in 
                people. Use the pet you get as it's the level 49 Necro pet and 
                does a decent amount of damage as well as interrupting casters. 
                In order of casting, you should engage opponents with Dispell/Normal 
                DoTs/ATK Drain/AC Drain/Lifetap DoT/Spears/Lifetap in that 
                order.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Top Easy-To-Get PvP Items:</b><br>
                <br>
                I tried to pick the top three items that are usefull most of 
                your levels. There are of course better things once you get

                Developer's Update: Why was OoW delayed?</font></b></p>
                </font>
                <font style="font-size: 9pt">
                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana">pretty simple question in 
                itself...<br>
                <br>
                Was it to address player issues, hence why you had the summit?<br>
                <br>
                Was it because you last expansion (GoD) was still not finished 
                and encounters in there were bugged?<br>
                <br>
                Was it because level 70 was still not ready, and since you had 
                already released content based on level 70, you needed to finish 
                out thoughts on level 70 spells and stats?(remember Brenlo 
                stated that level 70 was supposed to be introduced on the fifth 
                aniversary as a FREE upgrade to all and GoD was tuned based on 
                that expectation of level 70)<br>
                <br>
                Was it because OoW was simply not ready to be released on time, 
                and needed to be delayed anyways?<br>
                <br>
                Was it simple lip service to calm people down in hopes that they 
                would pay for thier account a few more months while you sorted 
                things out?<br>
                <br>
                I'm way way disapointed in seeing so many of the monk top ten 
                being put on hold until after oow, especially after it was 
                stated that these were separate teams of developers and OoW had 
                it's own subgroup of staff.<br>

                To stop any nashing of teeth before it starts, the berserker 
                AA's are planned to be included in the update scheduled for the 
                same day as the Omens launch, but they are not part of the Omens 
                launch. Therefore if you choose not to purchase the expansion on 
                the day it launches you will still get the berserker AA's that 
                are included in the update.<br>

                <br>
                There appears to be /pet nocast commands on test, based off 
                parsing of the strings there. How about a /pet no melee and /pet 
                do not move ability? /pet no melee makes the pet not attack 
                anything in melee combat. No matter what, they refuse to melee.<br>
                <br>
                /pet do not move makes the pet not move. They won't charge 
                opponents, but rather stand still. They can still have aggro. 
                Together with a non-damaging root on an earth pet, you could use 
                an earth pet to effectively CC any rootable NPC.<br>
                <br>
                /pet no melee<br>
                /pet do not move<br>
                /pet cast<br>
                /pet attack <br>
                <br>
                will make an earth pet stay still and chain cast root (up to 
                recast delay) on its target. This also gives mages 'ghetto 
                snare' for soloing. It also has utility with air and fire pets.<br>

                I've always thought the pets should have more utility. Don't get 
                me wrong some of them are fairly powerful. However, the 
                inability to effectively control them makes their usage limited 
                in group and raid situations. For more information, click

                Fix Random Video Lag</font><font size="6" color="red"><b><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 9pt" color="#993333">:</font></b></font></p>
                <p align="left">
                <font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 9pt">A lot of people have 
                noticed what appears to be random video lag since the DirectX 9 
                engine went live several months ago. Many players, even with 
                very high end systems, are forced to log out and back in or even 
                restart in some cases due to video lag that makes the game 
                unplayable for them. Many others have been unable to &quot;Dual Box&quot; 
                since that patch for the same reasons.<br>
                <br>
                The problem that's causing this is a simple memory leak that 
                Sony either can't find or doesn't care about. This is why most 
                people notice the problem after they've zoned a few times. The 
                better your<br>
                system, the longer you can go without noticing it, but 
                eventually it hits everyone at some point.<br>
                <br>
                Thankfully, there's a very simple workaround for this. Simply 
                hold down ALT and hit ENTER at the same time. This is the toggle 
                between windowed and full screen modes. It forces the game to 
                re-allocate resources and re-draw the world and UI due to the 
                screen changing sizes. You can do it twice to maintain whichever 
                way you normally play, but this method will get rid of that 
                &quot;random&quot; video lag that's been happening with the new engine.<br>
                <br>
                Many people in my guild have used this simple workaround to 
                great effect, and are able to play in<br>
                zones where they could not before, and are enjoying EverQuest 
                again. If the lag is bugging you, give this a try. Heck, I don't 
                even lag in PoK anymore after using this. </font></p>

                <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 9pt">A 
                recent patch added new commands to allow others to drag your 
                corpse, but they didn't make it into the patch release notes.<br>
                /consent group - flags your current corpse(s) so they can be 
                dragged by all current group members.<br>
                /consent raid - flags your current corpse(s) so they can be 
                dragged by any members of your current raid (including people 
                who join the raid later).<br>
                /consent guild - flags your current corpse(s) so they can be 
                dragged by anyone in your guild.<br>
                /deny group - removes the flag<br>
                /deny raid - removes the flag<br>
                /deny guild - removes the flag<br>
                --- <br>
                When you need to drag someone's corpse, rather than use a hotkey 
                that has &quot;/corpse&quot; in it, there is a &quot;/corpsedrag&quot; command that 
                you can use to make things easier for you.. If you target the 
                corpse you&nbsp;need to drag and type &quot;/corpsedrag&quot;, it acts as an 
                autofollow for the corpse! The corpse will follow you wherever 
                you need to go!<br>
                <br>
                When you get to where you wanna drag it to, just use the &quot;/corpsedrop&quot; 
                command to release it :)<br>
                <br>
                Now, I'm not sure if you could attach multiple corpses to you or 
                not, as I've only had to drag 1 corpse since I found this 
                command. But it could be handy if you could drag more than one 
                corpse&nbsp;at a time.</font></p>

              Before I post your updated list I would like to give you a little 
              bit of information on the notes I have made on each item. <br>
              <br>
              Currently being evaluated – This means that a few of the 
              development team members are looking into ways to implement the 
              item. This does not guarantee that the item will be implemented; 
              however we may see changes made in the future. The Community Team 
              plans to give updates on these types of items every 2 weeks, even 
              if it’s just a “no change since the last update” <br>
              <br>
              Currently being discussed – This is almost just like being 
              evaluated however these items the development team is totally 
              undecided if they want to implement or how to do so. The Community 
              Team plans to give updates on these types of items every 2 weeks, 
              even if it’s just a “no change since the last update” <br>
              <br>
              Done – This means that the development team has implemented this 
              item and it’s currently on live servers. <br>
              <br>
              Currently on Test server – This means that the development team 
              has implement this item and it’s currently on test server, watch 
              for future updates for implementation on the live servers. <br>
              <br>
              Waiting for community feedback – This means we don’t have enough 
              information to make any type of decision on how to implement. 
              Threads will be started by me to get your feedback. <br>
              <br>
              No changes planned at this time – This means that the development 
              team has decided at this time not to implement this item. <br>
              <br>
              Items that are marked done will be removed from the top 10 issues 
              lists and you as a class will be able to replace those with new 
              issues. Watch for posts on this in the next week, your class 
              correspondents will be helping SOE update your top 10 issues lists 
              with these new items. If your top issues list was less then 10 
              issues to begin with you will be able to add more issues. <br>
              <br>
              You as a class will have the option to replace items that are 
              marked as “no changes planned at this time” with new items or 
              leave them on the list. Please understand that leaving them on the 
              list does not mean that they will eventually be implemented 
              however it does mean that the class as a whole still feels that 
              these are valid issues and would like implementation eventually. 
              One thing to note, we will not be responding to requests as to why 
              something is classified the way it is. <br>

                just have to wait and see what really does happen. On that front

                Gates of Discord <br>
                ------------------- <br>
                - Zone experience modifiers were increased in all zones from Tipt/Vxed 
                and beyond. <br>
                - Natimbi, Qinimi, Barindu, Riwwi, and Ferubi should be tuned 
                more appropriately for their intended level ranges. <br>
                - NPCs will no longer hit for max damage as often. Knights in 
                particular should find it easier to tank the NPCs they previously 
                had difficulty with. <br>
                - Ikkinz -- Guilds no longer have to flag every member in order 
                to complete the Ikkinz trials. Only one person needs to complete 
                all events/raids to start the seventh Ikkinz trial. At that point, 
                all players who complete the seventh trial will get full credit 
                for the zone. <br>
                - NPC innates have been adjusted to behave a little more reasonably. 
                <br>
                - Zone travel has been made easier. Animal aggression was lowered 
                by changing their faction and See Invis percentages were reduced 
                on several NPCs. <br>
                - Spell drops have been increased. <br>
                - Increased the rate of cash drops. <br>
                - The mini bosses in Qvic now have a more appropriate respawn 
                rate. Their item drop rate has been increased to compensate for 
                this. <br>
                - Breakdown in Communication quest now has improved rewards! </p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory">Collision <br>
                ------------------- <br>
                More improvements to the collision system should make it a lot 
                more difficult to get stuck. </p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory">Misc. <br>
                ------------------- <br>
                The Eye of Zomm will once again open closed doors.</p>

                on your existing EverQuest account, don't give it to them. IGN

                for 2 groups of about 50th level. <br>
                A party of adventurers is missing and was last seen working with

                elvish city of Takish Hiz! Now you must find what was left beneath 
                the sands. Good luck. </p>

                aimed at characters level 20 to 51. The Hot Spot zones will shift 
                from time to time, so watch for messages giving clues as to where 
                the new ones may be. </p>

                East Wastes. You will be able to swap the items back and forth

                with 1000's upon 1000's of emails, and It would just take to long
