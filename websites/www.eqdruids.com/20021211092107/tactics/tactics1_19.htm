I'm Duffer, and I'd like to share with you a few things that you can do if you're just starting out as a young druid. Following this guide should allow you to get to level 19 pretty darn fast (2&nbsp;-&nbsp;4 days of play time).</p><p>Now, I'm not (yet!) an old, wise, and experienced druid. In a previous life I attained the 16th circle before moving to another plane of existence, and I've just now hit level 19, which has been my primary goal for being a druid in the first place: teleportation!</p><p>This is also from the perspective of a Halfling druid. I'm certain you can do the same as a wood elf, half elf, or human, but I'm not familiar with the newbie zones (especially on Faydwer, so use with discretion).</p><p>Finally, these ideas are not all my own. I've read lots of different druid sites and tips, etc. So if this sounds suspiciously similar to something else you've read, I probably read and took to heart the same thing.</p><p>Get on with it you say? Very well, here goes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left><a href=#Contents><font face Arial size=2>Back To Top</font></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a name=1-4><font face=Arial size=3 color=008000><b>Babe in the woods (1&nbsp;-&nbsp;4)</b></font></a><p>Your only goal is to level as fast as your little (or long) legs will let you. Kill everything that cons white or blue, but stick with white. Other sites have good newbie guides, my only advice is don't worry about dying. Who cares? Take yellows if you think you can handle them (watch out for those spiderlings until level 3&nbsp;-&nbsp;4), the experience is well worth it. These levels should go FAST.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left><a href=#Contents><font face Arial size=2>Back To Top</font></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a name=5-8><font face=Arial size=3 color=008000><b>A little youngling (5&nbsp;-&nbsp;8)</b></font></a></p><p>You have a little bit better spell now (Burst of Fire), and in the thicket at least, it's time to move beyond the wall. Giant rats are great exp for a level 4&nbsp;-&nbsp;5 player, I killed them whenever they conned blue to me even as a level 6. You should also be able to take out black bears (watch out for the Young Kodiaks!), especially if you use snare and panic animal to good effect. Leveling is slower, but you should still go pretty fast. Toward the end here, you should be taking on gobs. Use your harmony, you can pull an entire camp of three while the other classes have to worry about getting mobbed.</p><p>You also need to start hunting the gobs for the weapons and armor. You'll need to get several of your level 9 spells right off the bat, although you can wait on some of the others. The ones I used all the time (in order) were: <b>Ignite, Light Heal, Shield of Thistles, Thistlecoat, Strength</b>. The last two are not all that necessary, but nice. Save the rest for when you have money (more on that in a bit).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left><a href=#Contents><font face Arial size=2>Back To Top</font></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a name=9-14><font size=3 face=Arial color=008000><b>Adolescent (9&nbsp;-&nbsp;14)</b></font></a></p><p>At level 9 you get your first &quot;nice&quot; damage spell, ignite. Ignite does 33 damage to start, which is a very nice upgrade. Even though the ratio of damage/mana isn't all that great, it's nice to be able to blast things out of existence. This will allow you to start taking on some of the larger thicket inhabitants: Giant Spiders, wasps, and young kodiak (in that order, e.g. 9, 10, 11). My strategy was brute force and simple:</p><p><b>Target : Snare : Turn and run : Blast : run : Blast ...</b></p><p>Once you've blasted the target down to 1/4 or 1/3 of it's hit points, turn and melee. This serves two purposes: one you won't have enough mana to totally blast the good exp creatures out of existence, and two you need to at least make a semblance of keeping your melee skills up.</p><p>Personally I was able to have both 1hb and 1hs in the mid forties by 12th level or so, using this strategy. However, my 2hb suffered, and I had to really work to get 2hb up to the 60 or so mark which is where it still sits since I've turned back to practicing the other skills. I have found it to be impossible to keep all three skills maxed at each level. I simply don't (and can't) melee well enough.</p><p>At level 10, I faced a choice. There are plenty of things in the thicket that will give you good experience up until level 14 (bind and SOW!), but it starts getting a little thin toward the upper end, and you really will most likely wind up either &quot;blast kiting&quot; young kodiaks until you're bored stiff, or camping the orcs in the corner, which is also pretty darn boring, and there's typically a lot of people there.</p><p>Instead, I decided that it was time to set out for a bit of an adventure. Since my strategy involved experience more than loot, I was particularly poor, but since I'd killed a lot of goblins, my Storm guard faction was fairly high. I decided to do the Bloodforge hammer quest and get myself a magic weapon.</p><p>So, purchase camo (if you don't already have it) and head west to Qeynos. There are enough descriptions of the quest that I'm not going to go into it here. Suffice to say, if you're daring, don't bother getting yourself bound in Qeynos, because if you kill Trumpy you can gate back to Rivervale and be more than halfway to Freeport. If you're paranoid like me, get yourself bound in Qeynos and plan on running to Freeport. Anyway, kill Trumpy and get his head.</p><p>In retrospect, there may be a couple of other things you might want to do while you're in or around Qeynos. First, if you've been smart and lucky, you'll have saved yourself one each of a low, medium, and high quality bear pelt (that is, if you don't mind hunting animals). If you go to the entrance of Surefall glade and talk to Chanda Miller, she'll happily make you a belt and boots. Just tell her <b>[Baobob sent me]</b>. However, my faction wasn't high enough for her to make me a cloak, but I was able to pay a young local an extra 5 gold to have the cloak made. Requires a bit of trust, but I didn't have a problem.</p><p>Second, you may want to try and nab Gnasher Furgutt while you're here. If you turn Gnasher's head and note into a guy in Surefall (I don't remember the name), and then take the note that he gives you to Captn. Tillian in Qeynos, you can get a medallion that has a +5 to charisma. Handy for those of us who are charismatically challenged (50 for me!). I still haven't done this yet, but Gnasher is supposed to be about level 10, so it should be doable.</p><p>With Trumpy's head in a sack, and optionally sporting a new cape, belt, boots, and medallion, head off for Freeport. Personally I always run through the gorge and RV, it gives me a chance to stop off at the guild if I've saved enough money for another spell, plus I've just never figured Highpass Hold out. Maybe in a few more levels. In Freeport, hop on the boat, make your way to Kaladim, and turn in Trumpy's head to Byar Bloodforge for your brand spanking new Bloodforge hammer.</p><p>Get yourself bound in Kaladim, and make sure that you have lots and lots of bags, boxes, etc, because you're about to hit (young) loot city.</p><p>Head back to the docks, and get on the boat. Now, not too long after the boat zones into the Ocean of Tears, you'll pass some rocks. Get off on the first rocks. There are five aqua goblins here. Three of them can be pulled individually, the other two require harmony, but if I was alone here, I found that I typically could only keep up with the spawn rate of two of these goblins. These gobs are nice for two reasons. First, there typically aren't that many people around (or any... in my experience I had to share the spawn with two people... one on a regular basis, and one dwarf once who had accidentally fallen off the boat). Second, every single goblin carries a bow worth 2g (slightly less with my charisma). Take the gobs until you can barely move/fight from the weight, gate back to Kaladim to sell, and repeat until you hit level 12 or you get really really bored!</p><p>Make sure to snare the gobs when they get to 1/3 to 1/2 health. They turn and run easily, and nothing sucks worse than trying to get in position to swing underwater. If they turn and stand there, you can whack them in the back all day (this was where my weapon skills really progressed ... lots of melee). My strategy was to snare, target self, thistle shield, target gob, and melee/ignite. I could sometimes pull with an ignite or get an ignite off after the snare, but be careful. You want the thistle shield up, and it does NO GOOD to cast ignite on them when you're out of the water and they're in it. If one gets away, just sit down and meditate. I never had one pull a friend in the time that I hunted here.</p><p>For selling, prices suck in Kaladim, but they can be helped somewhat if you've gotten your charisma up, and if you sneak up to a merchant (of the opposite sex, seems to help!) to sell. Make sure they con indifferent. (You have been practicing all your skills all along, right?).</p><p>By level 11 the gobs here are low blues/high greens, so while you can continue to 12 here (I got close), you could make the argument to just take off once you hit level 11. The goblins probably would be great experience solo or in a group of 2 for level 8-9 characters. But that's a little young to get the Bloodforge, which is critical for the next stage of your life.</p><p><b>Wisps</b>. Until you hit level 14, head to the West Commonlands around the tollbooth, and get ready to smack some wisps. Since you have a magical weapon and spells, you're well situated. You're doing this now because these are the best levels for experience AND loot from wisps. Your goal: <b>Greater Lightstones.</b> Players buy Greater Lightsones for 8pp each (exercise to the reader to figure out why!), and you can typically sell normal lightstones for 1pp each (although they're in less demand... just sell in RV, if you can't find a PC who wants them). Just destroy the Burned Out Lightstones, they are worthless. If you're lucky, you can make 100-150pp pretty easily here in a couple of levels. This was (and still is) the best loot I've found. The fact that you can hunt them while getting experience is just gravy, because you'll be trying to snag them along with other, higher level characters who just need the loot.</p><p>Here are some hints for fighting wisps: <ul><li>Only take one at a time. By late level 13 you may be able to take out two at a time with your damage shield and a lot of luck, but don't count on it. <li>Always damage shield yourself first, and don't be afraid to burn the wisp to a crisp with ignite, while you're whacking on it with your new BF hammer. <li>I found it handy to sit near the spawn spots in treeform, since your hit points regenerate so much faster, I was able to rely more on melee and less on mana dumps, which let me fight more wisps, more often. Just be wary of being near a spawn spot, because three wisps will take you out like yesterday's trash, and be careful of other PC's coming over to take that nice little unoccupied wisp sitting in front of the tree. I had to explain myself a couple of times when a caster pulled a wisp from me with a big spell, and I dumped my mana into it to make sure I got the kill. I also got lots of laughs. Anyone who comes up close will get messages about the wisp getting hit, so it's mostly the casting classes that get a little worked up. But you can loot in treeform too, so there's no need to move. As a handy side effect, you don't have to worry about the griffs or hill giants, either. So when everyone else scatters, it's dinner time! Get as many as possible.</ul><p></p><p align=left><a href=#Contents><font face Arial size=2>Back To Top</font></a></p><p><a name=14-16><b><font size=3 face=Arial color=008000>Teenager (14&nbsp;-&nbsp;16)</font></b></a></p><p>Yippee! SOW! Bask in your glory. Take your wisp money and buy all the rest of your spells. I cleaned up all the empty slots that I hadn't purchased from the earlier levels, spotted a friend 30pp to practice a trade that I want to take advantage of later, and bought myself a couple of better pieces of armor (snakeskin jerkin, gloves, etc). I'm still (even at level 19) mostly in patchwork. I just haven't taken the time to upgrade! But, that's what teleport is for (IMHO). I also picked up a combine scimitar to replace my old tarnished one. It was kind of expensive (35pp), but I wanted a faster weapon to go back and practice my 1hs with.</p><p>OK, another spell you get at level 14 is Expulse Summoned. What does this mean? It means there's only one place for you! <u>Lavastorm</u>. Get yourself a couple of stacks of batwings (typically you can purchase from vendors around newbie areas, or from Newbies themselves) for levitate, and he thee to Lavastorm. Make sure to camo yourself through the Nektulos forest, because the guards there don't want to see your scruffy face. Lavastorm is filled to the brim with elementals. And your new spell does 87 or so damage to elementals. Very, very nice. What this means is that you need to go back to your snare, run, burn trick. The down time is considerable, yes, but you'll be soloing yellows all the way to level 17. These levels should go FAST. If you want, you can group with another druid for even quicker take downs, but it's not really necessary. I don't see much point to grouping with anyone other than a druid in Lavastorm. We rule the zone at this level.</p><p>A couple of suggestions: <ul><li>Stick with yellows, watch out for greenies. The elementals ARE aggressive. Expel works on Elementals and Fire Imps. So those are your targets. <li>Don't EVER take on a Basilisk. They'll just eat your little druid hide by paralyzing you and then munching on your little druid butt. You can't use your good spell on them, so why bother? There are lots of other good targets. <li>Make sure to use your protection from fire spell all the time, and if you have to close to melee, save enough mana to damage shield yourself. <li>Don't bother with swarm here. Instead, use any down time you have to practice summoning food/water. I had taken no time to practice before level 14, which meant that I spent a couple of TV shows casting nothing but summon spells until my conjuration was in the 40s before I even tried casting swarm. Swarm will come in handy in the next phase of your existence, never fear.</ul><p></p><p>At level 16 you'll have to hunt for yellow elementals, but most of the lava crawlers will still be white or yellow. I typically didn't waste my time on a blue unless I'd run around for a while without finding a yellow. The experience gain from yellows solo is nothing short of remarkable. Almost makes you want to play a necromancer.</p><p>Level 17 pretty much ends the parade here. Almost everything will be blue, and experience starts crawling again. You can probably stay here for one more level, but I was ready for a change of pace at this point.</p><p align=left><a href=#Contents><font face Arial size=2>Back To Top</font></a></p><p><a name=17-18><b><font size=3 face=Arial color=008000>Young Adult (17&nbsp;-&nbsp;18)</font></b></a></p><p>You have to find someplace with more whites and higher level blues. For me, this was Eastern Karana. There are lots of Chasm Crawlers and Gorge Hounds that con anywhere from blue to yellow to a level 17. However, you must develop a new strategy to hunt here. Especially if you're going to solo.</p><p>Personally, I had some great groups here, typically just a ranger and myself for a constant stream of blues. Or, if you find a third person, you can start to take crag spiders, which should be yellow and red at level 17. I grouped successfully with a ranger/bard and ranger/enchanter...I'm sure a second melee class would also be nice, but the bard made for a rapid pace, since I wasn't using too much mana. Strategy (for both blues and crags) was to target the puller (Rangers are great -- plug plug) as he shouts incoming, and thistle shield as soon as you can. Then /assist, cast swarm, and wade into melee. I only used ignite when we needed to take something down fast, either because the Ranger was getting hit hard, or because we had somehow pulled two critters. For blues, I would sit down and meditate for the last 1/3-1/2 of the fight... my mana was more of a limiting factor than the tanks hit points. And I could med more than it would take to heal the damage he would take at the end of the fight. This will help your experience, be a lot less boring than solo, and also help to up your melee skills, since you'll often be beating on yellows/reds if you're pulling crags.</p><p>Solo, it's time for a new strategy. Charm! Just be sure to always have a SOW that will <b>not</b> wear out, and always warn people if you're going to run to the bridge. Target a blue (crawlers make great pets, and seem to last longer than hounds in my experience), and immediately attack another blue. For the first one, burn as much as is reasonable, the goal is to get the critter down ASAP, let your pet take some damage, but try and make sure it has enough life to take out one more critter. I typically swarm the blue I want to attack, then type (or hotkey) &quot;/pet attack&quot;. Sit and med for the first half of the battle (if your pet is going to turn, it'll do it pretty early, so you might as well get a smidge more mana. If your pet stays charmed and the target is at about half health, get up and chuck your ignites. You want the experience!</p><p>As soon as the target dies, target another blue and send your pet off. Swarm and then target *your pet*, get fairly close, and sit down and meditate. Watch your pet's health bar. When it gets down to about 1/3, you need to get in there and take some hits. The goal is to have the second blue drop with your pet's health bar barely visible (or at least at about 20% or so). You'll often have your pet turn at this point, so don't be afraid to zone if you've got two on you. If you get the second one down, take your wounded pet off to a corner (near bridge or gorge zone), and sit down to med for real. Keep your pet targeted so you can keep an eye on its health bar. (it's especially nice if it is poisoned, so the health bar stay's low). Meditate until the pet turns on you, and then get up and whack it. It doesn't have much health, and you've just got your third blue critter in 5 minutes and one mana bar. Exp is GREAT. Better than grouping, in my experience, but groups are more fun. Exp can also suck when you've just zoned for the third time without getting off a single successful kill.</p><p>Some final hints: <ul><li>If you've almost got the target down, and your pet turns, DON'T BOTHER finishing off the initial target. If you do, your pet will get the credit, and you will get ZIP. If they're both almost dead, you might be able to target your pet first, finish it off, and then finish off the first guy, but I've never successfully done this to test. I consider this to be a BUG and I've /bug'ged it several times. Do so yourself. It's nuts when you've almost got it dead, one more ignite finishes it off, and then it vanishes in a puff of smoke. <li>Whatever you do, don't charm griffawns. Yes, they're blue. Yes, they hit hard. However, they also seem to have the greatest magic resistance. They resist all the time (and at almost a full bub for charm, that's expensive), and they break early constantly. I tried this several times before I learned my lesson. <li>Don't try to take on &quot;just one more&quot; critter. Two and your pet is about as good as you can do. By the end, my mana is almost gone, and I need to med. <li>Don't damage shield your pet. You may find yourself finishing it off, and I know it must be my imagination, but I swear thistle shield lasted forever on my pet. It hurts to be getting hit for not only 20-30 damage per bite, but another 6 every time I hit for 10 damage with my combine scimitar. Ouch.</ul><p></p><p>The spells I had memorized from level 17 and level 18 were: <ol><li>Light Healing <li>Swarm <li>Ignite <li>Snare <li>Thistle Shield <li>Panic Animal <li>Befriend Animal</ol><p align=left><a href=#Contents><font face Arial size=2>Back To Top</font></a></p></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></table></center></font></td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr></table><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td><p align=center style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size=1>All information contained on this website copyright Thistlethorne Enterprises 2001-2002.&nbsp; Everquest copyright Sony Inc.</font></p></td></tr></table><!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table><!--msnavigation--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td><p align=center style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size=1>All information contained on this website copyright Thistlethorne Enterprises 2001-2002.&nbsp; Everquest copyright Sony Inc.</font></p></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table></body></html>
