Have you heard of the place where [grieg] resides? <br> <br> You say, &quot;grieg&quot; <br> <br> Nilibik Driogo says &quot;Aye, Grieg Veneficus. We do not know much about this madman, only where his [stronghold] is. One of my friends from the Eye was sent there to investigate it, but he has not returned. It has been quite some time and I am ver worried about him.&quot; <br> <br> You say, &quot;stronghold&quot; <br> <br> Nilibik Driogo says &quot;Grieg's End is what it has become to be known as. Some reports have come back that this place is cursed with foul visages. Any entering will surely loose their minds. I.. I would go but you see I am desperately busy here in the city doing..uh..many important things! You <br> look like you could help, [will you travel] to Grieg's End and look for my friend? <br> <br> You say, &quot;will you travel&quot; <br> <br> Nilibik Driogo says 'Good, I am glad you would prove yourself useful to Seru. Look for Bronus, you should beware if he has lost his sanity for he is almost as powerful as myself.' <br> <br> Look for a naked gnome named Bronus in Greig's End. He drops a cracked amulet. <br> <br> Give Nilibik Driogo the &quot;cracked amulet&quot; and his response is: <br> <br> Nilibik Driogo speaks a small incantation as he pulls a branch from a nearby tree and ties it around the amulet 'I shall mourn him dearly, he was a good friend. This was the amulet that I had given him before he left to explore Grieg's End. I want you to have this for helping to find his lost soul. Go <br> in peace my friend. <br> <br> You get the Nilibik's Yew Affixed Amulet</span></p><table cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><tr><td id=headerrow><b>Nilibik's Yew Affixed Amulet</b></td><td id=headerrow align=right>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td vAlign=top width=50%><table cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><tr><td><font size=2>LORE ITEM NO DROP</font></td></tr><tr><td><nobr><b>AC:</b> +7</nobr> <nobr><b>Wis:</b> +5</nobr> <nobr><b>Mana:</b> +25</nobr></td></tr><tr><td><b>Weight:</b> 0.0</td></tr><tr><td><b>Classes:</b> All Classes</td></tr><tr><td><b>Races:</b> All Races</td></tr><tr><td><b>Inventory Slot:</b> Neck</td></tr></table></td></tr></table><p><a href=seru.htm>Back</a></td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr></table><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td><p align=center style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size=1>All information contained on this website copyright Thistlethorne Enterprises 2001-2002.&nbsp; Everquest copyright Sony Inc.</font></p></td></tr></table><!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table><!--msnavigation--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td><p align=center style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size=1>All information contained on this website copyright Thistlethorne Enterprises 2001-2002.&nbsp; Everquest copyright Sony Inc.</font></p></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table></body></html>
