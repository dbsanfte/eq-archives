        Entertainment Inc. (SOE), a worldwide leader in massively multiplayer 
        online gaming, introduced plans for SOE All Access™, an all-in-one 
        subscription service that will allow gamers access to all of SOE’s 
        premium entertainment content - from EverQuest® to PlanetSide™ to 
        EverQuest® II - for one low price of $21.99 a month. The SOE All Access 
        subscription offer will begin on May 19, 2003, just in time for the 
        launch of PlanetSide, SOE’s latest premium online game.</font></p>
        <p class="text" align="left"><font face="Arial">“We have grown our 
        business to the point where our fans have several different types of 
        gaming options available to them and we want players to be able to 
        experience everything we have to offer,” said John Smedley, president, 
        Sony Online Entertainment. “The SOE All Access subscription provides an 
        easy, cost-effective way for an SOE fan to play all of our games. Once 
        again, Sony Online is setting a precedent that will affect the online 
        gaming entertainment industry on a global scale.”</font></p>
        <p class="text" align="left"><font face="Arial">The SOE All Access 
        subscription will give players access to all current SOE content, 
        including
        <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/about.jsp" target="_blank">

        II</a>, which is scheduled to launch this Fall. Subscribing to SOE games 
        will be streamlined through the SOE All Access subscription, giving 
        players a single account to use across all titles. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Currently, SOE charges separate 
        amounts for each of its titles. EverQuest carries a $12.95 monthly 
        subscription cost, while the upcoming PlanetSide will cost $12.99 a 
        month. EverQuest Online Adventures for the PlayStation®2 computer 
        entertainment system runs $9.99 per month. The Station Pass, which 
        allows access to casual online games Infantry, Cosmic Rift and Tanarus, 
        is $6.95 a month. By activating the SOE All Access subscription, players 
        now have access to all of these games for $21.99, a potential savings of 
        more than $15 a month. When EverQuest II goes live, the SOE All Access 
        subscription will grow in value even more. Players will still have to 
        purchase each title individually, but the SOE All Access subscription 
        will provide them with a single account to use across each of the SOE 
        titles they own. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The SOE All Access subscription offer 
        is only good for recurring SOE subscribers playing SOE published games. 
        The SOE All Access offer will not be available for non-SOE published 
        titles, such as LucasArts' Star Wars Galaxies™: An Empire Divided™ or 
        versions of EverQuest, EverQuest Online Adventures or PlanetSide 
        published by SOE partners outside of North America. In addition, the SOE

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Greetings Norrathians, </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Over the course of the next week you 
        will be hearing a lot from SOE about <em>EverQuest II</em>. It's coming 
        along extremely well, and it's something that we as a company are very 
        proud of. We hope that when it is released you'll feel it lives up to 
        its distinguished heritage. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">All the talk about <em>EQ II</em> 
        will lead many of you to ask the logical question: </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">What about <em>EverQuest</em>? </font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The simple answer is this: We are 
        going to continue to support <em>EverQuest</em>. As a matter of fact, we 
        have two new expansions in the works. The first one's coming this Fall, 
        and its focus is on dungeons! Many members of the <em>EQ</em> team are 
        already hard at work on it. We've increased the size of the <em>
        EverQuest</em> team to add more amazing things to the game, to further 
        expand places you've explored before and to continue to update the game 
        on a constant basis. Our goal is to make sure <em>EverQuest</em> remains 
        a dynamic game that continues to grow for years to come. We recognize 
        that you've spent a lot of time in <em>EQ</em> over the years--so have 
        we. Making this world exciting for you is our passion. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">We are also working hard on making
        <em>EverQuest</em> a better experience. One of the ways we're doing this 
        is by improving the way we communicate with you. From this point on you 
        will see a constantly updated Web page that shows what we're working on 
        for the next patch, and what's down the road a little further. This can 
        be found at <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/updates/">
        http://eqlive.station.sony.com/updates/</a> </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Above all else, we want you to know 
        that our commitment to this game is very real. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The goal behind EverQuest II is not 
        to replace <em>EverQuest</em>, but to offer a new experience with new 
        ways to play. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">I've had the privilege over the past 
        few years to see how the <em>EQ</em> and <em>EQ II</em> design teams 
        have worked together to make sure <em>EQ II</em> has the heart and soul 
        of <em>EverQuest</em>, but is still different enough to attract new 
        people to the MMORPG genre, and even bring back some players that have 
        moved on to other things. We think that many of you are as excited about
        <em>EQ II</em> as we are. If we do our jobs right, you'll feel like <em>
        EQ II</em> is a remarkable gaming experience that you'll want to play 
        for many years to come, and that it's not just &quot;<em>EQ</em> with a new 
        graphics engine.&quot; The designers have found some great ways to link the 
        two games and to make the games actually affect each other. You'll hear 
        more about this in the very near future. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">So, would you rather play in <em>
        EverQuest II's</em> Age of Destiny? Or does <em>EverQuest's</em> Age of 
        Turmoil still have plenty of exciting things you want to do? Our goal is 
        to make that decision simple! Having spent so much time in <em>EverQuest</em>, 
        you might feel torn between which game you want to play more. We realize 
        that many of you will want to play both <em>EQ</em> and <em>EQII</em>, 
        so we're introducing the SOE All Access™ subscription. It allows you to 
        play a large mix of our most popular offerings for only $21.99 per 
        month. Our Legends customers will receive this same access to our games 
        at no additional charge. This makes it affordable and easy to play SOE's 
        games, including: </font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">We think the SOE All Access

        you can see that this subscription offers significant savings. This low 
        price will allow you to check out <em>EQ II</em>, but still play <em>EQ</em>. 
        We don't want your decision on which game to play to be made based on 
        cost, but rather on the kind of gaming experience you're looking for. 
        We're offering a lot of great quality games in this package just to make

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The reward for the flags will

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Flags will not be necessary for

        increase the above charms potency.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">There will be level limits to the 
        zones when the flags are removed.&nbsp; Right now they are thinking 55 
        for tier two zones, and 62 for tier three.&nbsp; Which means you don't 
        have to worry about the little newbie twinks running around ruining your 
        fun.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">They are adding the ability to 
        transfer items in your bank from one character to another on the same

        <normal>** Hate Plane **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>The new Plane of Hate is now available on all servers!</normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>The Plane of Hate is an old favorite of many players, and we 
        were careful to retain as much of its old charm as possible (and all of 
        its old quests). At the same time we created all new geometry for the 
        zone using our newer tools and newer design ideas. Old and new players 
        should find this zone to be a lot of fun and a fair challenge. Remember, 
        the price for the Fuligan Soulstone of Innoruuk has been cut in half.</normal>

        <normal>Yes, the long-lost ancient city of the Iksar has been 
        discovered. If you're brave enough, foolish enough, and if you can hold 
        your breath, you may be the right hero to explore Veksar. Good luck!</normal>

        <normal>** Changes for New Players **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Maps for Newbie Zones for all Players - One of the biggest 
        hurdles that a new player has to overcome is learning their way around. 
        For those of you that may have started your first character in Neriak, 
        you’ll know what that was like. In order to help out the new player, 
        we’ve enabled the Map window to make it available to all players if they 
        are in a &quot;newbie” zone.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Context Tips - In order to provide helpful information at the 
        time a player needs it, we have added several context tips. These tips 
        will pop up when a player uses a certain feature or a specific event 
        occurs. We hope this will help our new players to more easily understand 
        the gameplay and controls for EverQuest. These tips may even be useful 
        to long time players. However, if you wish, you can choose to turn off 
        any specific tip, or turn off all of the tips using the check boxes in 
        the Context Tips window. </normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Improved Help Information - The in game help files have been 
        improved. They now contain much more information. Hopefully most 
        questions you have about the game can be answered using help.</normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- All New Characters now start with a weapon skill - In order to 
        help the new player that might forget to train with their weapon before 
        heading out to defeat their first enemy (and even for those of us that 
        have been playing a while and still forget to do this), all new 
        characters now start off with a skill of 5 in their primary weapon</normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Taunt no longer requires training - Similarly, Taunt now works 
        without being trained. Characters still start out with a skill of 0, but 
        the skill can increase with use.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Packet Loss Meter is now Off by default - Due to the fact that 
        the packet loss meter is often confusing to new players, it will be off 
        by default. You can toggle the packet loss meter using the F11 key.</normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- New Message to prompt new players about the Help button - 
        We’ve added a chat message that appears when a level 1 through 10 
        character logs in that tells them to click the &quot;?&quot; button on the Window 
        Selection toolbar if they need help.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal />
        <normal>** Spells **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Divine Intervention Fix - Players have been reporting that 
        Divine Intervention was not updating the hit points for the character 
        every time when cast, causing characters to die even though the spell 
        seemed to have saved them. We have been unable to reproduce the issue 
        specifically, but we have made some changes that should fix the problem. 
        Please use /bug with details of the incident if you continue to see this 
        problem.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Bard Epic Animations - Bards will no longer play instrument 
        animations when they have their epic equipped. No more stabbing 
        yourselves in the head with your sword instead of playing a flute.</normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Healing Messages now include the name of the healer - In order 
        to make it clearer who has healed you, we have changed the message that 
        you receive when healed. It will now include the name of the character 
        casting the healing spell: &quot;Bob has healed you for 300 points of 
        damage”.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Call of the Hero works in PoW - We have removed the 
        restrictions to Call of the Hero in the Plane of Water. In this 
        particular zone we don’t believe that the use of this spell needs to be 
        restricted.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Fear Spell bug fix - Players have reported that when a player 
        character was affected by a Fear spell cast by an NPC, they would see 
        the character running away but the person affected would not actually 
        flee.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Snare Line bug fix - Fixed an issue that was causing the Snare 
        line of spells to fail on an NPC that is under the effects of a Fear 
        spell.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Trickster’s Augmentation group only - We changed Trickster's 
        Augmentation to be group only to prevent folks from using it to “grief” 
        other players.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- LD Enchanters no longer cast Mem Blur - Enchanters that go 
        linkdead were sometimes casting Memory Blur and similar spells on their 
        enemies. This could cause rather unpleasant results for his group or 
        raid when the NPC suddenly had a fresh hate list. Linkdead enchanters 
        will no longer cast Memory Blur spells.</normal> <br>
        </font>
        <normal></normal>
        <font face="Arial"><br>
        <normal>- Blizzard animation fix - Blizzard was causing a casting 
        animation to go off with every wave, even if the caster was sitting. Now 
        Blizzard works like most rain spells, and only triggers a casting 
        animation when first cast.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Locked Spell Gem fix - We fixed a bug that was causing the use 
        of a right-click item to refresh the spell gem in the first slot 
        instantly, but if that spell had a long recast it would render it 
        useless until the spell was forgotten and memorized again.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Mark of Kings upgrade - In order to make this spell more 
        appealing then its lower level counterpart, Mark of Karn, we have: 
        increased the duration from 3.5 to 4 minutes, reduced the casting time 
        from 3 to 2 seconds, reduced the mana cost from 170 to 75 and made the 
        spell slightly less resistible.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Gravel Rain can now be cured - With its very long duration (30 
        minutes) it was a bit difficult that this spell could not be removed 
        before the duration was over. This is now a curse and can be cured.</normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Summoning a horse in bear form no longer causes you to lose 
        the ability to cast spells for a while.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Rathe’s Son - The innate ability of the focused version of 
        this pet is now less resistible.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Child of Bertoxxulous - This 65th level Necromancer pet has 
        been given a boost. Its offense has been increased to be in-line with 
        that of the Legacy of Zek, and it now has the ability to use a power 
        that is essentially the same as the spell Banshee Aura.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Spirit Call - These pets were running away from enemies when 
        at low health. Pets should be far more loyal and willing to risk 
        themselves for their Shaman friends, so we’ve fixed it so that Shaman 
        pets will no longer run away.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Vampiric Embrace - We’ve corrected a bug with this spell that 
        would prevent the character from casting for a couple of seconds after 
        the proc went off.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Stun Spells - The message on many stun-type spells have been 
        changed to more accurately portray their effect on stun immune 
        creatures.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Mana from Buffs - we have increased the maximum amount of mana 
        that can be gained through the use of buff spells.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>** Items **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Zoning and losing your buffs - There has been a long-standing 
        problem that could cause all of the buffs to be stripped from a 
        character if they zoned with fewer hit points than they had bonus hit 
        points granted by items. For example, if your character had only 10 hit 
        points left when zoning, and had an item that granted +15 hit points, 
        all of your character’s buffs may have been stripped when you completed 
        zoning. We have fixed this bug. You should now retain your buffs in this 
        situation.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- GM Baking Spoon - On Firiona Vie, the Grandmaster’s Baking 
        Spoon was not no-drop. This allowed players to give out an unlimited 
        number of 100% weight reduction bags. This obviously was not the 
        intention for that item, so we have made the Grandmaster’s Baking Spoon 
        no drop on Firiona Vie.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Wooden Medicine Totem - This item can now be equipped. It 
        couldn’t before.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Adjutant Saber - We removed the secondary notation on the 
        item, since it was only usable by Shadowknights and Paladins, who 
        couldn’t use it in their secondary slot anyhow.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Cloak of the Dar Khura Hero - The effect on this item was 
        listed in the database as the wrong effect type. The effect is now 
        permanent.</normal> <br>
        <normal />
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>** NPCs **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- NPCs returning bags empty - NPCs that return items that they 
        do not need were returning all containers empty, regardless of what was 
        inside the container. NPCs that refuse unusable items will now also 
        return bags with their contents intact.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- NPCs returning multiple items - If a character gave an NPC 
        multiples of the same item, the NPC would only give back one of them if 
        he did not want them. We have fixed this so that now those items will be 
        returned. Such items will be stacked on your cursor. Just click the item 
        that is on your cursor into your inventory and the next one will appear 
        on your cursor. Keep clicking them into your inventory until you have 
        them all back. BE WARNED that any of these items that you have not 
        returned to your inventory will be lost if you zone or go link dead 
        before you get them back into your inventory.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- The Spirit of Rage - This undead gorilla is now flagged as 
        undead.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Solusek Ro’s Guards - These guards will be much more attentive 
        to their lord and will aid in his defense.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- NPCs healing too much - We have corrected a bug that was 
        causing some NPCs to regain hit points when they turned to run away. The 
        affected NPCs will be of all sorts and in many zones.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Giant Yellow Jackets - The chance to find a thorax on the 
        corpses of these creatures seemed too low, so we have increased it.</normal>
        <br>
        <normal />
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>** Zones **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Veeshan’s Peak - We have changed this zone to make it more 
        appealing, particularly for those playing with one or two groups. We 
        have removed the restriction against using gate in this zone and 
        modified the zone population. Over all, the zone will be better to play 
        in.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Acrylia Caverns - We have fixed an issue with the first two 
        seals that was causing the door to the 3rd seal to open without the 3rd 
        seal spawning, and without the events being completed correctly. Now the 
        door will only open under proper win conditions, and whenever the door 
        opens the 3rd seal should be available.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Plane of Nightmare - We have changed the logic for entry to 
        the Thelin Poxbourne event in Plane of Nightmare. When you talk to 
        Thelin, he will now remember your raid and only allow those of the same 
        raid into your maze. Only three groups maximum will be allowed through 
        the portal into any one maze. If your group is not in a raid, he will 
        allow three non-raided groups through into the same maze. If there are 
        three non-raided groups in the maze and you try and get a fourth 
        through, he will act as any other raid would and tell you that he has 
        already let enough people in the maze.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Planes of Water and Fire - We have changed some of the spells 
        used by the mini-bosses in these two zones. They should be a little 
        easier to resist now.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Halls of Honor - We have removed a recently added summoning 
        ability from NPCs. We have introduced a less intrusive method of 
        preventing the ability to use area of effect abilities on huge groups of 
        NPCs in the zone.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Bastion of Thunder - The tower bosses will now be dropping 
        some loot every time (rather than sometimes not dropping any) like the 
        other Planes of Power bosses</normal> <br>
        <normal />
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>** Quests **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Added Honey Mush Bread to Cabilis Vendors - This is an item 
        needed for a quest that was unavailable.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Officer’s Cloak - If you have combined your Officer's Cloak in 
        the Security Satchel or you wish to upgrade to the new Officer's Cloak 
        of Service, speak with Scout Derrin in Grimling Forest.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>-The Skull of Torment quest - This quest, in Kurn's Tower, 
        should now work.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>** Alternate Advancement **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Elemental Form - In order to make the Magician Elemental Form 
        abilities a bit more useable, we’ve reduced the reuse time from 72 
        minutes to 15 minutes.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Alternate Advancement timers - We fixed a bug that allowed AA 
        timers to be reset early.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Mass Group Buff - We have made this ability available to 
        Beastlords.</normal> <br>
        <normal />
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>** Miscellaneous **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Characters getting stuck in the world - We have fixed a bug 
        that would cause a character to stay in game for extended periods of 
        time after going linkdead. This bug was causing people to receive a 1018 
        error because their character was still in the world and could prevent 
        them from logging back in for a long period of time.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>- Big Dwarves - Fixed a bug that was causing Dwarves that had 
        their size increased twice to start to see the insides of their faces 
        while attacking. This was making even the stoutest Dwarves a bit 
        uncomfortable and self-conscious.</normal> <br>

        <normal>- Hit Point percentages display in windows - The Target window, 
        Player window and Group window now display hit point percentages. This 
        is something that many player created interfaces use and, considering 
        the popularity of this feature, we’ve decided to add it to the default 
        interface. In the Target and Group windows, the hit point percentages 
        will disappear if the appropriate target/groupmate does not exist</normal>

        <normal>- Combining Stacks of items - Attempting to combine stacked 
        items in a container will no longer work. The items must be separated

        <normal>- Bankers no longer take items - In order to help prevent people 
        from losing items by giving them to their banker instead of putting them 
        into their bank, players can no longer attempt to trade with bankers. A

        - part II</font></h1>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">We've been keeping a close eye on the 
        progress of high-end guilds towards the Plane of Time, and have made 
        difficulty adjustments over the past few weeks to improve the Rathe 
        encounter. Guild Afterlife of the Mithaniel Marr server were the only 
        players to defeat the Rathe council, and we'd like to congratulate them 
        on their success. While Afterlife was successful in beating the Rathe 
        council, we felt the encounter was still harder than it should be, and 
        made one last adjustment to make it an easier encounter. Since we made 
        that change, a few other guilds have also managed to beat the new easier 
        Rathe council and we look forward to their adventures in the Plane of 
        Time. We feel that this encounter is now well balanced and don't 
        anticipate further changes to the event. <br>
        <br>
        Now that the Plane of Time has been entered, it's given us an 
        opportunity to look at what's involved in getting there. One issue 
        that's been brought up is that once a guild gets into the the Plane of 
        Time, it's a bad idea to have them going to kill lower-tier gods to get 
        story flags for their new members. This has two real issues - first, it 
        means the Plane of Time capable guild is killing gods they wouldn't 
        normally fight anymore, and second, they're taking those gods away from 
        lower-tier guilds who are interested in experiencing them. <br>
        <br>
        We're making some changes to zone entrance requirements throughout 
        Planes of Power soon, in order to make the lower tiers much more 
        accessible to players and to help with the feeling of being &quot;left 
        behind&quot; if you miss certain raids or events. We'll be detailing those 
        changes in the next week or so, but we're going to make this change to 
        Plane of Time access tonight: <br>
        <br>
        In order to gain access to the Plane of Time, each character simply 
        needs to have killed the four elemental gods and have a Quintessence of 
        Elements. <br>
        <br>
        This change should maintain the difficulty of gaining Plane of Time 
        access, but decreases the amount of lower-tier content needed for 
        reflagging new members. This leaves the gods in the lower planes for the 
        guilds who want to experience them, and keeps the Elemental Planes 
        guilds in zones more appropriate to their power level. We feel this is a 
        good change for the game and benefits high-level guilds of all types. As 
        noted above, we'll be announcing additional Planes of Power changes next 
        week that address many of the common concerns we've heard about planar 
        progression. <br>
        <br>
        Thanks for playing, <br>

          Some of the folks that recently completed The Rathe Council encounter 
          were unable to enter the Plane of Time. The requirements for entry are 
          complicated, and those people simply missed a step in the quest that 
          gains them entrance (just an NPC that they needed to talk to). We've 
          talked to them and explained what they missed, and they have been able 
          to gain entry by completing the missing step. <br>
          <br>
          However, we are going to modify the quest steps a bit to make them

        based on Sony Online Entertainment’s upcoming EverQuest® II computer 
        game.&nbsp; The game, tentatively titled Guild Wars will allow fans of 
        EverQuest and the upcoming EverQuest II to experience the fantasy world 
        of Norrath in a brand new way. In the game, players will take on the 
        role of prominent guilds battling for prestige on a “server.” Guild Wars 
        will be released a month before the launch of the EverQuest II (<a href="http://www.everquest2.com">www.everquest2.com</a>

        highly-anticipated massively multiplayer online role-playing game.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">“The EverQuest franchise is the 
        dominant brand in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game 
        category, and having seen much of the upcoming content in EverQuest II, 
        we can see that dominance will continue far into the future,” said 
        Robert Watts, CEO of Sabertooth Games, Inc. “We know that lots of 
        current and past fans of the EverQuest franchise are also fans of 
        collectible card games, which makes this a natural product for 
        Sabertooth Games.”</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">“The popularity of fantasy-based 
        collectible card games has grown exponentially over the last four years 
        since EverQuest initially launched, and the timing is perfect for 
        Sabertooth Games to bring our brand and lore to the fans in an entirely 
        new way, ” said Mark Chuberka, director of business development at Sony 
        Online Entertainment, Inc.&nbsp; “Sabertooth is creating a fun, high-quality, 
        collectible card game that will deliver engaging gameplay for all who

        this server never allows transfers. <br>
        <br>
        We'll take a look into this next week as we work on finding out the name 
        of the server. The idea certainly has merits, and several eyebrows were 
        raised in interest at the appeal of it. I'll post again when I have more 
        information next week. <br>

        <p align="left">From EQLive:</p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">SOE celebrates the rapidly expanding 
        EverQuest world by opening a brand new server. Join now and be one of 
        the first to experience EverQuest from the ground up! Each player 
        joining this server will be starting at level 1, so now is a great time 
        to jump in and play. All characters on this server will be new and 
        transfers to this server will not be allowed until at least six months 
        after it opens. <br>
        <br>
        The new server fulfills two purposes. It offers more room for our player 
        base to grow as the number of subscribers continues to increase. It also 
        offers a fresh starting point for players of all types. It gives 
        players, new and old, the opportunity to lead the way, to build a new 
        community on a fresh new server. Be among the first people on the server 
        to explore the haunting castle of Mistmoore or the eerie Tower of Frozen 
        Shadow in Velious. <br>
        <br>
        EverQuest is a game about shared adventure. An exciting journey into the 
        heart of the dragon's lair is a lot more fun if you have friends to 
        share it with. This new server is an excellent opportunity to gather up 
        your friends from other servers, or even those that have never played 
        before, and experience new adventures together. <br>
        <br>
        In appreciation for those that have been EverQuest players from the very 
        beginning, this server will be named after one of these long-standing 
        player's characters. SOE will randomly pick 8 of the first 1,000 players 
        who subscribed to EverQuest and who are still playing and then SOE will 
        select one character name from each account. Current EverQuest players 
        will be allowed to vote on which one of those names should be used for 
        the new server. <br>
        <br>
        Please stay tuned to <a href="http://www.everquestlive.com/">EverQuest 
        Live site</a> for further details. <br>
        <br>
        Thanks, <br>

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Well, to start it's an amazing 
          zone. And no, it's NOT underwater! When you zone in you are underwater 
          but when you come up above the surface there is a plank you can go up 
          into a hall and down some stairs to the Bloogill Goblin area. The 
          Goblins were light blue at lv61. There was only one way out of the 
          goblin area. You go up onto a ramp into another hall. In here are new 
          mobs. These things sorta look like big iksar zombies. They were light 
          blue at 61. Anyway, moving on we encountered a mob we couldnt get past 
          with invis. A Duke conned blue at 61 and was a shadowknight (Fear and 
          HT). After killing him we entered an underwater maze. After coming 
          out, the mobs got harder. They started conning Dark Blue. We went on 
          for awhile, basically going through a city. I will have screenshots 
          too.<br>
          <br>
          There was also a named mob that gave a quest and asked for 4 items 
          from the theatre but we bypassed that.</font></p>
