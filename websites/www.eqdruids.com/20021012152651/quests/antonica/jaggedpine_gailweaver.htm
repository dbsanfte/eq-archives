    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">This quest 
    starts in Jagged Pine Forest, and is given by Annous Pineshadow, a white 
    robed human near one of the camp fires, once you've attained Ally faction 
    with the Jagged Pine Folk. <br>
    <br>
    The Gale Weaver <br>
    You say, 'Hail, Annous Pineshadow' <br>
    <br>
    Annous Pineshadow closes his eyes and gives a deep bow of his head in formal 
    greetings, 'Good day to you, Orolmy. I am Annous Pineshadow, high priest of 
    The Rainkeeper and ambassador of Qeynos. It has been a [long] time since I 
    last set foot within the Jaggedpine, and although not surprised, I am amazed 
    and awestruck at the untouched purity of these sacred grounds. It is very 
    much a relief to know that the forest has been sparred the taint of the 
    venomous world that has become Norrath.' <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'How long has it been?' <br>
    <br>
    Annous Pineshadow gives a gentle chuckle as he conjures his most fond of 
    memories, 'Sixty years -- give or take. This is the place of my birth and my 
    home. When I had come of age, I ventured to Qeynos to learn the ways of the 
    priest, finding myself lost in the ways of the druid. I adore the nature 
    that Karana sustains, but I had always felt myself more suited for the path 
    of preservation and servitude of the faith. When his majesty, Antonious III 
    sealed the Jaggedpine, I was among those who were asked to remain behind in 
    Qeynos. Only the druids and rangers of Karana remained in the Jaggedpine -- 
    it was important to preserve only the bare minimum and we understood the 
    need. We also did not wish to have our culture be entirely cut off and those 
    who remained outside of the forest's confines were there to continue the 
    faith and [sacred ways] of The Rainkeeper.' <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'What sacred ways do you speak of?' <br>
    <br>
    Annous Pineshadow says 'There are hundreds of different rites, ceremonies, 
    prayers, and rituals that are performed in one's devotion to The Rainkeeper. 
    Many of these can be as simple as the performance of a duty, as a druid 
    would protect their forest, while some may be as complex and consuming as a 
    several day ceremony to usher in the changing seasons. Aaaah. . . but there 
    is truly so much that in the time that's left for me here could not give 
    proper justice for in my explanations -- nor do I believe that you would 
    truly understand them by simply listening. You must [have the faith in your 
    heart] and you must truly wish to uphold the ways of the Rainkeeper and do 
    so to truly understand.'' <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'I have faith in my heart.' <br>
    <br>
    Annous Pineshadow says 'I would not dare challenge that, my friend, but is 
    your faith strong enough to withstand the greatest of consequences -- even 
    the sacrifice of your own life in remaining true to that faith? Aaaah. . . 
    but such is a question that cannot be merely asked and simply answered in 
    words. One truly does not discover one's self until they are faces with the 
    reality of such tests of faith. Perhaps, if [you are willing], I might guide 
    you on a path that may lead to the discovery of such answers.'' <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'I am willing to test my faith.' <br>
    <br>
    Annous Pineshadow says 'Excellent, child. I am pleased to know that you are 
    willing to go so far as to test your faith -- but do so not to me, or to 
    anyone other than yourself and The Rainkeeper, else you shall find only a 
    hollow shadow of the answers you seek, and a great void of disappointment. 
    If you prove successful in your own eyes by completing this task, then you 
    shall be among The Rainkeeper's sacred order of priests -- The Gale Weavers. 
    Druids and Clerics alike make up this order, for our dedication is mutual in 
    strength and our ultimate duties to The Rainkeeper are parallel. The first 
    journey that you must embark on will result in the acquisition of the [Azure 
    Idol of Karana] -- an ancient item that each of The Gale Weavers possess.''
    <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'What is an Azure Idol of Karana?' <br>
    <br>
    Annous Pineshadow says 'When the order was first founded by the Hierophant 
    known as Tanirun Galeweaver, he bestowed upon all of his brethren a sacred 
    idol carved by his own hands. It is said that when Tanirun blessed the 
    Shrine of Karana with his gift of the storm, that the remaining essence of 
    Karana's witness was divided among the idols. In the passing times, the 
    idols were handed down when an old member passed beyond into the Eye of 
    Karana's Storm and a new member was inducted in their predecessor's memory 
    and honor. You will seek one of these idols -- one that at present has no 
    owner and was stolen by the bandit raiders and return it to me. The man who 
    possesses the idol is one known as Drayen Blackguard -- a member of the 
    dreaded Blackguard family that has taken recent residence in the forest. You 
    shall find him in the mountains of Rathe if our scouts are correct.'' <br>
    <br>
    Find and kill Drayen Blackguard at the bandit camp in Rathe Mountains and 
    loot (immune to changes in run speed): Azure Idol of Karana. <br>
    <br>
    You give the Azure Idol of Karana to Annous Pineshadow <br>
    <br>
    Annous Pineshadow says 'Marvelously done, my friend. The idol's return by 
    your hand bodes well indeed toward the success of your quest. Now, it shall 
    remain without a hand to possess it -- but in time, perhaps, it may find a 
    suitable possessor in you. If [you wish to prove yourself worthy] of the 
    idol and further prove your faith as notable enough to belong to the sacred 
    order of The Gale Weavers, then speak your pledge and your test shall 
    continue.'' <br>
    <br>
    Your faction standing with Residents of Jaggedpine got better. <br>
    Your faction standing with Jaggedpine Treefolk got better. <br>
    Your faction standing with Protectors of Pine got better. <br>
    Your faction standing with Guards of Qeynos got better. <br>
    You gain experience!! <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'I wish to prove myself worthy' <br>
    <br>
    Annous Pineshadow says 'Then your endeavor shall continue, my child. Take 
    this scroll -- to you now it holds no meaning but in due time you shall 
    understand. Keep the scroll close to you until you have sought and 
    successfully acquired the [Dormant Crystal Sphere] and [The Rainkeeper's 
    Writ].' <br>
    <br>
    You receive: Ancient White Scroll. <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'What is a dormant crystal sphere?' <br>
    <br>
    Annous Pineshadow says 'There are several magical spheres throughout Norrath 
    but this sphere is [unique to The Rainkeeper]. <br>
    It is said that when Karana blessed this area with his first storm in 
    acceptance of the nomadic tribe that would settle here, that the droplets of 
    rain left upon the pines and blades of grass was gathered by one of these 
    nomads and stored in a plain clay jar that was then buried as a symbol of 
    their own gratitude toward the storm. Nearly a century later when Karana's 
    Shrine and the Throne of Karana's Thunder were near completion, one known as 
    Tanirun Galeweaver found the jar. The water was still inside, preserved by 
    means unexplainable through simple reason. It is said that Tanirun poured 
    the water into his own hands and wove a spell, sealing the wind within the 
    orb of this ancient rain that was now crystallized by Tanirun's spell.'' <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'How is it unique to the Rainkeeper?' <br>
    <br>
    Annous Pineshadow says 'Tanirun's orb was used to make the first symbol that 
    to this day is wielded by the members of the sacred order. His effects were 
    duplicated by the first order and each bore an orb identical to Tanirun's. 
    These orbs, as the idols, were passed down from member to member. As with 
    the idol, we held an orb that had no bearer. However, before the Jaggedpine 
    was sealed, the orb disappeared. We are not certain as to how or why, but we 
    do know that if it lies within the hands of one who is not of Karana's 
    faithful priests, it shall become dormant until awoken. I have heard rumors, 
    distant whispers upon the wind and storm that the orb lies within the depths 
    of Solusek's Eye -- nestled in the hands of a giant known as Neiroth the 
    Tyrant. Find this ancient giant and retrieve the orb from him.'' <br>
    <br>
    Find and kill Neiroth, a named Fire Giant in the room people describe as the 
    Lord Nagafen 'prep' room. and loot: Dormant Crystal Sphere. <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'What can you tell me of the Rainkeeper's Writ?' <br>
    <br>
    Annous Pineshadow says ''When the order of The Gale Weavers was established, 
    Tanirun and his brethren of the order constructed a sacred writ similar to a 
    spell, but it cannot be invoked at the priest's whim. Like the storm, it is 
    chaos. When the words are spoken, the elements of the storm will come as 
    they wish, when they wish. This writ was used to conjure the essence of the 
    storm into the orbs, creating the mirror of a sky where a storm rages 
    eternally. The writ was lost to us sometime before the Jaggedpine was 
    sealed. One known as Naundruar, a former high priest of our order, took the 
    writ. He was furious, enraged that the order had been asked to divide and 
    leave our sacred homeland. None are ultimately certain what horrible fate 
    befell him, for his hatred toward Qeynos had infected his being like an 
    incurable disease. In the southern plain of Karana you will find the 
    remnants of this once great priest and with him, you shall find the writ.'''
    <br>
    <br>
    Find and kill Sir Nandruar (not Naundruar as described) a Giant Skeleton in 
    South Karana and loot: The Rainkeeper's Writ. <br>
    <br>
    You hand The Rainkeeper's Writ to Annous Pineshadow <br>
    You hand Dormant Crystal Sphere to Annous Pineshadow <br>
    You hand Ancient White Scroll to Annous Pineshadow <br>
    <br>
    Annous Pineshadow says 'You have done well, my child. The ancient scroll has 
    impressed upon it a small mirror of your faith. As it was with you through 
    your travels, the runes have changed to reflect your own heart and what lies 
    within it. I have woven for you the Orb of the Gale -- your Orb of the Gale, 
    but do not think that your journey ends here. It is still hollow -- the 
    winds are dormant and the clouds lie in wait. Their lifeblood is missing, 
    and you must seek it. To do this, you must venture to the realm where the 
    Gale thrives -- the Plane of Sky. There are ethereal creatures known as Gale 
    Weavers that dwell there. You must extinguish their temporary tangible form 
    and from that, take the essence of the Gale that they have woven. Do not 
    feel remorse for destroying these planar creatures, for you do not truly 
    destroy them. Once you have obtained the Essence of the Gale, place it into 
    the orb and seal it, creating the Orb of the Gale that must be returned to 
    me.'' <br>
    <br>
    Your faction standing with Residents of Jaggedpine got better. <br>
    Your faction standing with Jaggedpine Treefolk got better. <br>
    Your faction standing with Protectors of Pine got better. <br>
    Your faction standing with Guards of Qeynos got better. <br>
    You gain experience!! <br>
    <br>
    You receive a 2 slot container in the design of a diamond. <br>
    <br>
    Now travel to the Pegasus Island in the Plane of Air and kill a Gale Caller 
    (not Gale Weaver as described above) and loot: Essence of the Gale <br>
    <br>
    Combine the Essence of the Gale in the container (no other items required):
    <br>
    You have fashioned the items together to create something new! <br>
    <br>
    [ Orb of the Gale ] <br>
    <br>
    You give Orb of the Gale to Annous Pineshadow. <br>
    <br>
    Annous Pineshadow says 'You astound me, my child. Well done indeed, and I am 
    very pleased to know that you have been successful in these endeavors. It is 
    an honor to bestow upon you this, our sacred symbol, and welcome you into 
    the order of The Gale Weavers. Bear it proudly, but do not flaunt pride. 
    Keep your sacred duties to The Rainkeeper first and foremost in your 
    thoughts and actions -- the Gale Weaver shall guide you when you need 
    guidance most, and it shall protect you when your time for failure has not 
    yet come. The idol shall remain with me, where I shall bury it at the Shrine 
    of Karana in honor of your coming into our ranks. When the time comes for 
    you to pass beyond, it shall be unearthed by another who has taken my place 
    as high priest of our order, for I will likely have passed into the Eye of 
    Karana's Storm before your final day.'' <br>
    <br>
