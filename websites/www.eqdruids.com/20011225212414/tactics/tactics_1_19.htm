        Young Druid Guide </font> </b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font size="2">Greetings, and well met. I'm Duffer, and I'd like to share with you a
        few things that you can do if you're just starting out as a young druid.
        Following this guide should allow you to get to L19 pretty darn fast
        (2-4 days /play time). </font> </b></p>
        <p align="justify"><b><font size="2">Now, I'm not (yet!) an old, wise, and experienced druid. In a
        previous life I attained the 16th circle before moving to another plane
        of existence, and I've just now hit L19, which has been my primary goal
        for being a druid in the first place: teleportation! </font> </b>
        <p align="justify"><b><font size="2">This is also from the perspective of a Halfling druid. I'm certain
        you can do the same as a wood elf, half elf, or human, but I'm not
        familiar with the newbie zones (especially on Faydwer, so use with
        discretion). </font> </b>
        <p align="justify"><b><font size="2">Finally, these ideas are not all my own. I've read lots of different
        druid sites and tips, etc. So if this sounds suspiciously similar to
        something else you've read, I probably read and took to heart the same
        thing. </font> </b>
        <p align="justify"><b><font size="2">Get on with it you say? Very well, here goes.

        </font><font face="Verdana" color="#CC9900" size="2">
        <p align="justify"><b>Your only goal is to level as fast as your little (or long) legs will
        let you. Kill everything that cons white or blue, but stick with white.
        Other sites have good newbie guides, my only advice is don't worry about
        dying. Who cares? Take yellows if you think you can handle them (watch
        out for those spiderlings until level 3-4), the experience is well worth
        it. These levels should go FAST. </b></font>

        <font face="Verdana" color="#CC9900">
<p align="justify"><b><font size="2">You have a little bit better spell now (Burst of Fire), and in the
        thicket at least, it's time to move beyond the wall. Giant rats are
        great exp for a L4-5 person, I killed them whenever they conned blue to
        me even as a L6. You should also be able to take out black bears (watch
        out for the Young Kodiaks!), especially if you use snare and panic
        animal to good effect. Leveling is slower, but you should still go
        pretty fast. Toward the end here, you should be taking on gobs. Use your
        harmony, you can pull an entire camp of three while the other classes
        have to worry about getting mobbed. </font> </b></p>
        <p align="justify"><b><font size="2">You also need to start hunting the gobs for the weapons and armor.
        You'll need to get several of your L9 spells right off the bat, although
        you can wait on some of the others. The ones I used all the time (in
        order) were: Ignite, Light Heal, Shield of thistles, Thistlecoat,
        Strength. The last two are not all that necessary, but nice. Save the
        rest for when you have money (more on that in a bit). </font> </b></font>

        <h3><font size="2" color="#CC9900" face="Verdana">Adolescent (9-14)</font></h3>
        </font>
        <font face="Verdana" color="#CC9900">
<p><b><font size="2">At level 9 you get your first &quot;nice&quot; damage spell, ignite.
        Ignite does 33 damage to start, which is a very nice upgrade. Even
        though the ratio of damage/mana isn't all that great, it's nice to be
        able to blast things out of existence. This will allow you to start
        taking on some of the larger thicket inhabitants: Giant Spiders, wasps,
        and young kodies (in that order, eg 9, 10, 11). My strategy was brute
        force and simple: </font> </b></p>
        <p><b><font size="2">Target : Snare : Turn and run : Blast : run : Blast ...
        </font> </b>
        <p><b><font size="2">Once you've blasted the target down to 1/4 or 1/3 of it's hit points,
        turn and melee. This serves two purposes: one you won't have enough mana
        to totally blast the good exp creatures out of existence, and two you
        need to at least make a semblance of keeping your melee skills up.
        </font> </b>
        <p><b><font size="2">Personally I was able to have both 1hb and 1hs in the mid forties by
        12th level or so, using this strategy. However, my 2hb suffered, and I
        had to really work to get 2hb up to the 60 or so mark which is where it
        still sits since I've turned back to practicing the other skills. I have
        found it to be impossible to keep all three skills maxed at each level.
        I simply don't (and can't) melee well enough. </font> </b>
        <p><b><font size="2">At level 10, I faced a choice. There are plenty of things in the
        thicket that will give you good experience up until L14 (bind and SOW!),
        but it starts getting a little thin toward the upper end, and you really
        will most likely wind up either &quot;blast kiting&quot; yks until
        you're bored stiff, or camping the orcs in the corner, which is also
        pretty darn boring, and there's typically a lot of people there. </font> </b>
        <p><b><font size="2">Instead, I decided that it was time to set out for a bit of an
        adventure. Since my strategy involved experience more than loot, I was
        particularly poor, but since I'd killed a lot of goblins, my Stormguard
        faction was fairly high. I decided to do the Bloodforge hammer quest and
        get myself a magic weapon. </font> </b>
        <p><b><font size="2">So, purchase camo (if you don't already have it) and head west to
        Qeynos. There are enough descriptions of the quest that I'm not going to
        go into it here. Suffice to say, if you're daring, don't bother getting
        yourself bound in Qeynos, because if you kill Trumpy you can gate back
        to Rivervale and be more than halfway to Freeport. If you're paranoid
        like me, get yourself bound in Qeynos and plan on running to Freeport.
        Anyway, kill Trumpy and get his head. </font> </b>
        <p><b><font size="2">In retrospect, there may be a couple of other things you might want
        to do while you're in or around Qeynos. First, if you've been smart and
        lucky, you'll have saved yourself one each of a low, medium, and high
        quality bear pelt (that is, if you don't mind hunting animals). If you
        go to the entrance of Surefall glade and talk to Chanda Miller, she'll
        happily make you a belt and boots. Just tell her [Baobob sent me].
        However, my faction wasn't high enough for her to make me a cloak, but I
        was able to pay a young local an extra 5 gold to have the cloak made.
        Requires a bit of trust, but I didn't have a problem. </font> </b>
        <p><b><font size="2">Second, you may want to try and nab Gnasher Furgutt while you're
        here. If you turn Gnasher's head and note into a guy in Surefall (I
        don't remember the name), and then take the note that he gives you to
        Captn. Tillian in Qeynos, you can get a medallion that has a +5 to
        charisma. Handy for those of us who are charismatically challenged (50
        for me!). I still haven't done this yet, but Gnasher is supposed to be
        about L10, so it should be doable. </font> </b>
        <p><b><font size="2">With Trumpy's head in a sack, and optionally sporting a new cape,
        belt, boots, and medallion, head off for Freeport. Personally I always
        run through the gorge and RV, it gives me a chance to stop off at the
        guild if I've saved enough money for another spell, plus I've just never
        figured Highpass Hold out. Maybe in a few more levels. In Freeport, hop
        on the boat, make your way to Kaladim, and turn in Trumpy's head to Byar
        Bloodforge for your brand spanking new Bloodforge hammer. </font> </b>
        <p><b><font size="2">Get yourself bound in Kaladim, and make sure that you have lots and
        lots of bags, boxes, etc, because you're about to hit (young) loot city.
        </font>
        </b>
        <p><b><font size="2">Head back to the docks, and get on the boat. Now, not too long after
        the boat zones into the Ocean of Tears, you'll pass some rocks. Get off
        on the first rocks. There are five aqua goblins here. Three of them can
        be pulled individually, the other two require harmony, but if I was
        alone here, I found that I typically could only keep up with the spawn
        rate of two of these goblins. These gobs are nice for two reasons.
        First, there typically aren't that many people around (or any... in my
        experience I had to share the spawn with two people... one on a regular
        basis, and one dwarf once who had accidentally fallen off the boat).
        Second, every single goblin carries a bow worth 2g (slightly less with
        my charisma). Take the gobs until you can barely move/fight from the
        weight, gate back to Kaladim to sell, and repeat until you hit level 12
        or you get really really bored! </font> </b>
        <p><b><font size="2">Make sure to snare the gobs when they get to 1/3 to 1/2 health. They
        turn and run easily, and nothing sucks worse than trying to get in
        position to swing underwater. If they turn and stand there, you can
        whack them in the back all day (this was where my weapon skills really
        progressed ... lots of melee). My strategy was to snare, target self,
        thistle shield, target gob, and melee/ignite. I could sometimes pull
        with an ignite or get an ignite off after the snare, but be careful. You
        want the thistle shield up, and it does NO GOOD to cast ignite on them
        when you're out of the water and they're in it. If one gets away, just
        sit down and meditate. I never had one pull a friend in the time that I
        hunted here. </font> </b>
        <p><b><font size="2">For selling, prices suck in Kaladim, but they can be helped somewhat
        if you've gotten your charisma up, and if you sneak up to a merchant (of
        the opposite sex, seems to help!) to sell. Make sure they con
        indifferent. (You have been practicing all your skills all along,
        right?). </font> </b>
        <p><b><font size="2">By L11 the gobs here are low blues/high greens, so while you can
        continue to 12 here (I got close), you could make the argument to just
        take off once you hit L11. The gobs'd probably be great experience solo
        or in a group of 2 for L8-9 characters. But that's a little young to get
        the Bloodforge, which is critical for the next stage of your life.
        </font> </b>
        <p><b><font size="2">Wisps. Until you hit L14, head to the West Commonlands around the
        tollbooth, and get ready to smack some wisps. Since you have a magical
        weapon and spells, you're well situated. You're doing this now because
        these are the best levels for experience AND loot from wisps. Your goal:
        Greater Lightstones. Players buy GLs for 8pp each (exercise to the
        reader to figure out why!), and you can typically sell normal
        lightstones for 1pp each (although they're in less demand... just sell
        in RV, if you can't find a PC who wants them). Just destroy the Burned
        Out Lightstones, they are worthless. If you're lucky, you can make
        100-150pp pretty easily here in a couple of levels. This was (and still
        is) the best loot I've found. The fact that you can hunt them while
        getting experience is just gravy, because you'll be trying to snag them
        along with other, higher level characters who just need the loot. </font> </b>
        <p><b><font size="2">Here are some hints for fighting wisps: </font> </b>
        <ul>
          <li><b><font size="2">Only take one at a time. By late L13 you may be able to take out
            two at a time with your damage shield and a lot of luck, but don't
            count on it.</font></b></font><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica" color="#808000"><font face="Verdana" color="#CC9900"><b><font size="2">

          </font>
          <font face="Verdana" color="#CC9900">
        <li><b><font size="2">Always damage shield yourself first, and don't be afraid to burn the
          wisp to a crisp with ignite, while you're whacking on it with your new
          BF hammer.</font></b></font></font><b><font size="2" color="#CC9900" face="Verdana">
        </font></b>
        <li><b><font color="#CC9900" face="Verdana" size="2">I found it handy to sit near the spawn spots in treeform, since your
          hit points regenerate so much faster, I was able to rely more on melee
          and less on mana dumps, which let me fight more wisps, more often.
          Just be wary of being near a spawn spot, because three wisps will take
          you out like yesterday's trash, and be careful of other PC's coming
          over to take that nice little unoccupied wisp sitting in front of the
          tree. I had to explain myself a couple of times when a caster pulled a
          wisp from me with a big spell, and I dumped my mana into it to make
          sure I got the kill. I also got lots of laughs. Anyone who comes up
          close will get messages about the wisp getting hit, so it's mostly the
          casting classes that get a little worked up. But you can loot in
          treeform too, so there's no need to move. As a handy side effect, you
          don't have to worry about the griffs or hill giants, either. So when
          everyone else scatters, it's dinner time! Get as many as possible.</font></b></li>
        </ul>
        <h3><font color="#CC9900" size="2" face="Verdana">Teenager (14-16)</font></h3>
        <p><b><font color="#CC9900" face="Verdana" size="2">Yippee! SOW! Bask in your glory. Take your wisp money and buy all the
        rest of your spells. I cleaned up all the empty slots that I hadn't
        purchased from the earlier levels, spotted a friend 30pp to practice a
        trade that I want to take advantage of later, and bought myself a couple
        of better pieces of armor (snakeskin jerkin, gloves, etc). I'm still
        (even at L19) mostly in patchwork. I just haven't taken the time to
        upgrade! But, that's what teleport is for (IMHO). I also picked up a
        combine scimitar to replace my old tarnished one. It was kind of
        expensive (35pp), but I wanted a faster weapon to go back and practice
        my 1hs with. </font></b></p>
        <p><b><font color="#CC9900" face="Verdana" size="2">OK, another spell you get at L14 is Expulse Summoned. What does this
        mean? It means there's only one place for you! Lavastorm. Get yourself a
        couple of stacks of batwings (typically you can purchase from vendors
        around newbie areas, or from Newbies themselves) for levitate, and he
        thee to Lavastorm. Make sure to camo yourself through the Nektulos
        forest, because the guards there don't want to see your scruffy face.
        Lavastorm is filled to the brim with elementals. And your new spell does
        87 or so damage to elementals. Very, very nice. What this means is that
        you need to go back to your snare, run, burn trick. The down time is
        considerable, yes, but you'll be solo-ing yellows all the way to L17.
        These levels should go FAST. If you want, you can group with another
        druid for even quicker take downs, but it's not really necessary. I
        don't see much point to grouping with anyone other than a druid in
        Lavastorm. We rule the zone at this level. </font></b>
        <p><b><font color="#CC9900" face="Verdana" size="2">A couple of suggestions:

        <ul>
          <li><b><font color="#CC9900" face="Verdana" size="2">Stick with yellows, watch out for greenies. The elementals ARE
            aggressive. Expel works on Elementals, Lava Crawlers, and Fire Imps.
            So those are your targets. </font></b>
          <li><b><font color="#CC9900" face="Verdana" size="2">Don't EVER take on a Basilisk. They'll just eat your little druid
            hide by paralyzing you and then munching on your little druid butt.
            You can't use your good spell on them, so why bother? There are lots
            of other good targets. </font></b>
          <li><b><font color="#CC9900" face="Verdana" size="2">Make sure to use your protection from fire spell all the time, and
            if you have to close to melee, save enough mana to damage shield
            yourself. </font></b>
          <li><b><font color="#CC9900" face="Verdana" size="2">Don't bother with swarm here. Instead, use any down time you have
            to practice summoning food/water. I had taken no time to practice
            before L14, which meant that I spent a couple of TV shows casting
            nothing but summon spells until my conjuration was in the 40s before
            I even tried casting swarm. Swarm will come in handy in the next
            phase of your existence, never fear.</font></b></li>

        <p><b><font color="#CC9900" face="Verdana" size="2">At level 16 you'll have to hunt for yellow elementals, but most of
        the lava crawlers will still be white or yellow. I typically didn't
        waste my time on a blue unless I'd run around for a while without
        finding a yellow. The experience gain from yellows solo is nothing short
        of remarkable. Almost makes you want to play a necromancer. :) </font>

        blue, and experience starts crawling again. You can probably stay here
        for one more level, but I was ready for a change of pace at this point.

        <p><b><font color="#CC9900" face="Verdana" size="2">You have to find someplace with more whites and higher level blues. For
        me, this was Eastern Karana. There are lots of Chasm Crawlers and Gorge
        Hounds that con anywhere from blue to yellow to a L17. However, you must
        develop a new strategy to hunt here. Especially if you're going to solo.
        </font></b></p>
        <p><b><font color="#CC9900" face="Verdana" size="2">Personally, I had some great groups here, typically just a ranger and
        myself for a constant stream of blues. Or, if you find a third person,
        you can start to take crag spiders, which should be yellow and red at
        L17. I grouped successfully with a ranger/bard and ranger/enchanter...
        I'm sure a second melee class would also be nice, but the bard made for
        a rapid pace, since I wasn't using too much mana. Strategy (for both
        blues and crags) was to target the puller (Rangers are great -- plug
        plug) as he shouts incoming, and thistle shield as soon as you can. Then
        /assist, cast swarm, and wade into melee. I only used ignite when we
        needed to take something down fast, either because the Ranger was
        getting hit hard, or because we had somehow pulled two critters. For
        blues, I would sit down and meditate for the last 1/3-1/2 of the
        fight... my mana was more of a limiting factor than the tanks hit
        points. And I could med more than it would take to heal the damage he
        would take at the end of the fight. This will help your experience, be a
        lot less boring than solo, and also help to up your melee skills, since
        you'll often be beating on yellows/reds if you're pulling crags. </font>
        </b>
        <p><b><font color="#CC9900" face="Verdana" size="2">Solo, it's time for a new strategy. Charm! Just be sure to always
        have a SOW that will *not* wear out, and always warn people if you're
        going to run to the bridge. Target a blue (crawlers make great pets, and
        seem to last longer than hounds in my experience), and immediately
        attack another blue. For the first one, burn as much as is reasonable,
        the goal is to get the critter down ASAP, let your pet take some damage,
        but try and make sure it has enough life to take out one more critter. I
        typically swarm the blue I want to attack, then type (or hotkey)
        &quot;/pet attack&quot;. Sit and med for the first half of the battle
        (if your pet is going to turn, it'll do it pretty early, so you might as
        well get a smidge more mana. If your pet stays charmed and the target is
        at about half health, get up and chuck your ignites. You want the
        experience! </font></b>
        <p><b><font color="#CC9900" face="Verdana" size="2">As soon as the target dies, target another blue and send your pet
        off. Swarm and then target *your pet*, get fairly close, and sit down
        and meditate. Watch your pet's health bar. When it gets down to about
        1/3, you need to get in there and take some hits. The goal is to have
        the second blue drop with your pet's health bar barely visible (or at
        least at about 20% or so). You'll often have your pet turn at this
        point, so don't be afraid to zone if you've got two on you. If you get
        the second one down, take your wounded pet off to a corner (near bridge
        or gorge zone), and sit down to med for real. Keep your pet targeted so
        you can keep an eye on its health bar. (it's especially nice if it is
        poisoned, so the health bar stay's low). Meditate until the pet turns on
        you, and then get up and whack it. It doesn't have much health, and
        you've just got your third blue critter in 5 minutes and one mana bar.
        Exp is GREAT. Better than grouping, in my experience, but groups are
        more fun. Exp can also suck when you've just zoned for the third time
        without getting off a single successful kill. </font></b>
        <p><b><font color="#CC9900" face="Verdana" size="2">Some final hints:
        </font></b>
        <ul>
          <li><b><font color="#CC9900" face="Verdana" size="2">If you've almost got the target down, and your pet turns, DON'T
            BOTHER finishing off the initial target. If you do, your pet will
            get the credit, and you will get ZIP. If they're both almost dead,
            you might be able to target your pet first, finish it off, and then
            finish off the first guy, but I've never successfully done this to
            test. I consider this to be a BUG and I've /bug'ged it several
            times. Do so yourself. It's nuts when you've almost got it dead, one
            more ignite finishes it off, and then it vanishes in a puff of
            smoke. </font></b>
          <li><b><font color="#CC9900" face="Verdana" size="2">Whatever you do, don't charm griffawns. Yes, they're blue. Yes,
            they hit hard. However, they also seem to have the greatest magic
            resistance. They resist all the time (and at almost a full bub for
            charm, that's expensive), and they break early constantly. I tried
            this several times before I learned my lesson. </font></b>
          <li><b><font color="#CC9900" face="Verdana" size="2">Don't try to take on &quot;just one more&quot; critter. Two and
            your pet is about as good as you can do. By the end, my mana is
            almost gone, and I need to med. </font></b>
          <li><b><font color="#CC9900" face="Verdana" size="2">Don't damage shield your pet. You may find yourself finishing it
            off, and I know it must be my imagination, but I swear thistle
            shield lasted forever on my pet. It hurts to be getting hit for not
            only 20-30 damage per bite, but another 6 every time I hit for 10
            damage with my combine scimmy. Ouch.</font></b></li>
