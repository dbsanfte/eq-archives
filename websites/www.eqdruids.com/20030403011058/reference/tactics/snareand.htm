Reverse-kiting) is an effective and relatively safe technique for druids to take down prey. It works on the same principle as a necromancer's fear-kiting techniques, except our line of fear spells are animal-specific. If done correctly, this technique can be rather mana-efficient.</p><p><font face=Arial size=2>This technique is most effective when a druid is grouped with one (or more) melee-classes doing fast melee damage. Monks, rangers and rogues are ideal candidates.</p><p><font face=Arial size=2>This would also include pet classes, such as magicians, necromancers, shamans, or beast lords, where their spells can supplement the damage generated by their pets. Enchanters can fill this niche also with their ability to charm most mobs, or summon an animated pet. Another druid could work as well, with one druid charming an animal and the other maintaining fear.</p><p><font face=Arial size=2>Lastly, we can fill this role by ourselves, although not as efficiently as when grouped.</p><p><font face=Arial size=2>A mana-dependant class, such as a wizard or cleric, would not be ideal for this tactic, as the downtime would negate any benefits received.</p><p><font face=Arial size=2><ol><li><b>Preparation</b><p><font face=Arial size=2>Find one or two group members based upon the recommendations previously stated. Have the following spell types memorized: <ul><li>Snare/Ensnare <li>Damage over Time (Swarm line, or Immolate line) <li>Panic Animal <li>Spirit of Wolf <li>Direct Damage (Ignite line) <li>Best Healing spell (just in case)</ul> <br> Any additional spells, such as Regeneration or a damage shield is a bonus, but not absolutely necessary. If you are working with another druid, or alone, have a Charm Animal spell memorized also. Root will be handy in case of adds.<p><font face=Arial size=2><li><b>Obtain a target</b><p><font face=Arial size=2>Animals will be prevalent in certain zones. The following zones have been noted to contain such animals and be good zones for hunting: <ul><li>Karanas (North, South, East, West) <li>Eastern Wastes (snow cougars) <li>Western Wastes <li>Emerald Jungle <li>Lavastorm (lava crawlers) <li>Stonebrunt Mountains <li>Lake of Ill Omen (sabertooths) <li>Chardok <li>Iceclad Ocean (cougars) <li>Nagafen's Lair (bats) <li>Timorous Deep (raptors) <li>Dawnshroud Peaks (rock hoppers) <li>Scarlet Desert (cheetahs) </ul><br> <li><b>Snare</b><p><font face=Arial size=2>Snare the animal from a distance, then give yourself enough room to cast your next spell.<p><font face=Arial size=2><li><b>DoT</b><p><font face=Arial size=2>This step is optional and best used on a difficult encounter. Cast this immediately following the snare. If you don't need the additional damage, proceed to step 5.<p><font face=Arial size=2><li><b>Scare</b><p><font face=Arial size=2>Your group member should intercept the animal with their pet, or themselves depending on the class, and melee it while you cast Panic Animal on the creature. This spell line tends to have a low resist rate and a low mana cost.</p><p><font face=Arial size=2><li><b>Kill</b><p><font face=Arial size=2>Once feared, the animal won't attack you or your group members until the panic animal wears off. It will run away from the group, usually following a set pathing pattern. Simply melee it down to nothing, casting the fear spell as often as necessary.</ol></p><p><a href=#Contents><font face Arial size=2>Back To Top</font></a></p></TD></TR><TR><TD><hr></TD></TR><TR><TD><a name=More><b><font face=Arial size=5 color=008000>Additional Notes</b></font></a> <br><ul><font face=Arial size=2> <li><b>Mana efficiency</b><p>As noted, the fear line of spells is low in mana cost. The same can be said for snare. If just these two are used, since the majority of damage is melee damage and healing won't be necessary, downtime due to mana recovery is minimized.<p><font face=Arial size=2><li><b>Health</b><p>As long as the target is constantly feared, your party will take a minimal amount of damage. Thus, beneficial healing will not be required. The addition of regeneration/chloroplast will noticeably reduce the need for healing<p><font face=Arial size=2><li><b>Downtime</b><p>Because you are not burning up your entire mana pool for one encounter, you'll generally find that your party can dispatch between 3 to 6 mobs (depending upon degree of difficulty) before you will need to recoup your mana.<p><font face=Arial size=2><li><b>Enchanters</b><p>Besides the obvious benefit of clarity, enchanters can also greatly enhance the efficiency of this tactic by utilizing their Tashan line of spells (irresistible magic debuffer), making your spells less likely to be resisted. If the enchanter uses an animation, allow him to take some initial damage before casting fear, so as to get the animation to attack the target.<p><font face=Arial size=2><li><b>Adds</b><p>Adds are annoying, period. If you do happen to encounter an add, your best strategy would be to either root, mez, or fear the add, while continuing to concentrate on the main target. Once the first target has been dispatched, then your party can deal with the add. If you get multiple adds and are unable to deal with them, abandon the fight, and Evac or zone.<p><font face=Arial size=2><li><b>Pathing</b><p>Some zones are notorious for particularly bad pathing by NPCs. In these cases, it would be better to dispatch the target more quickly by utilizing additional damage spells, or by enlisting the assistance of additional party members. <br></ul><p><a href=#Contents><font face Arial size=2>Back To Top</font></a></p></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></td></tr></table></center><p align=justify><a href=../../index.html>Return to Main</a></p></div></td></tr></table><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td><p align=center style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size=1>All information contained on this website copyright Thistlethorne Enterprises 2001-2002.&nbsp; Everquest copyright Sony Inc.</font></p></td></tr></table><!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table><!--msnavigation--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td><p align=center style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size=1>All information contained on this website copyright Thistlethorne Enterprises 2001-2002.&nbsp; Everquest copyright Sony Inc.</font></p></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table></body></html>
