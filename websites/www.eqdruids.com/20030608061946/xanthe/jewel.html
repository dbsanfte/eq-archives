<p><img src="bracelet1.jpg" align="left" width="51" height="47">I started Jewellery when I was quite young, probably only around level 14 or so, because I really liked the idea of being able to make magic items for myself, and to sell to other players. I’d talked to several higher level Master Jewellers and they had told me that it was a good way to make money once you had the worked up the capital to get to a high skill.</p><br>

I really do enjoy this trade skill, but I will warn you now, you are going to spend a LOT of money getting really good. I am now a Master Jeweller myself, but I am still only working on the lowest level Gold items, and I have spent in excess of 4000pp. This is probably a skill best left until you are at least mid level, or have vast resources from another character.<p><br>

When you make items with this trade skill, you have the choice of using plain metal bars and stones, in which case the items you make will not have magical properties, or you can use Enchanted metal in which case the items will be magical. The metal you buy from the jewellers shop will be plain old non-magic stuff, which you must then have enchanted by an enchanter of appropriate level (if you want to make magic stuff).<p><br>

<p><img src="bracelet1.jpg" align="left" width="51" height="47">Enchanting metal bars takes up a good amount of time and mana, and can also be quite tedious, so it is polite to offer compensation of the monetary kind to the person involved. I would never expect an enchanter to do this for free (unless maybe they were a Guild mate) so always offer them something for their services. Of course, you can save yourself a lot of time and hassle if you are the enchanter in question:)</p><br>

Also, recently aswell as using enchanted metals, you can now imbue the stone that you use. Each type of stone represents a particular deity of Norrath, and can be imbued by some of the god’s followers (shamans, druids, clerics, wizards). The resulting stone, when combined with an enchanted metal bar, will produce a piece of jewellery that can only be worn by a follower of that god, and will have certain magical qualities. Lists of the properties of both Enchanted and Imbued Enchanted jewellery can be found at some of the sites listed in the Links section.<p><br>

<p><img src="bracelet1.jpg" align="left" width="51" height="47">So, you still want to make jewellery? Well, thankfully the actual process of making a piece of jewellery is very easy. You buy a Jewellers Kit from a vendor (pic of jewellery kit), then you place 1 metal bar (silver, electrum, gold, platinum or velium) and 1 stone (many different types) into the kit and press combine. Simple as that.</p>

The metals work up in difficulty and price like this:<p>

Silver		(approx. 6gp per bar)<br>
Electrum	(approx. 1.5pp per bar)<br>
Gold		(approx. 10.5pp per bar)<br>
Platinum	(approx. 110pp per bar)<br>
Velium		(over 200pp per bar I think)<p><br>

The type of stone you use will also affect the difficulty of the piece.<p>

If you can, I strongly suggest that you put 21 practice points into the skill before you start. I find that Qeynos is a good place to jewel, as it has all of the stones that you will need (except maybe Wolf’s Eye Agate). Freeport is missing Rubies and Sapphires, amongst others.<p><br>

As you can see, as soon as you hit Gold each combine becomes very expensive. A higher Charisma will mean that you can buy your supplies for less, and also means that when you sell your successes back to the vendor, you will get a better price for them.<p><br>

<p><img src="bracelet1.jpg" align="left" width="51" height="47"> Whether you work with enchanted metal or not is up to you, although vendors will not give you very much more money for enchanted than non-enchanted pieces.
If you yourself are the enchanter, and you have the level and the spell required to enchant the metal, then go ahead if you have the time and the patience. Most enchanted items up to the end of electrum will not fetch a very high price to other players, and you might just about break even (although you will have to stand around trying to sell your wares for ages). Once you can make some of the more impressive gold items, it is worthwhile to start using enchanted metal.</p><br>

Regarding stones, if you were to look at a complete trivial list of items you would see that if you really wanted, you could make things like Silver Diamond Rings and such. All the stones that can be used in jewellery can be used with any of the metals. However, when skilling up, you will want to look at the total cost of making an item vs. the rewards of making it.<p>

A Diamond is a very expensive stone, going on some servers for up to 1000pp each. If you were to combine this with non-enchanted silver you would have a very pretty, but essentially useless item, which you would sell to the vendor and lose a lot of money on. Even if you used Enchanted Silver, the magical qualities of the ring would not fetch a very great price seeing as silver items have quite low stat enhancement.<p><br>

Therefore, you will be wanting to work up to a point in silver where the cost of the metal plus the stone you are using is not very much greater than the cost of the next metal type (electrum) plus the lowest quality stone (malachite). Electrum Malachite trivials at 74, so you will need to judge when you want to stop making silver items, and move over to electrum.<p><br>

For instance, I could stop making silver items when Silver Opal goes trivial at 50 (about 15pp per attempt). This may seem like there is a huge leap to 74 when Elcetrum Malachite goes trivial, but if you compare the cost of moving up 24 skill points using Electrum Malachite (about 2pp per attempt), to the cost of moving up 24 skill points using Silver and Diamonds, Black Sapphires, Rubies and the like (anywhere from 110pp to 1000pp per attempt) then it doesn’t seem quite so bad.<p><br>

<b><u><font size=+1>My route to Mastery</font></u></b><p><br>

<p><img src="bracelet1.jpg" align="left" width="51" height="47"> As I have already mentioned, I am a Master Jeweller, although by no means a very good one. My current skill is a measly 128 and I am working on Gold Malachite (trivial at 146). The reason for the large skill gap is that things that are trivial between 128 and 146 are very expensive to make, and every fail that I get will cost me a lot of money. I may get more fails per every X attempts at Gold Malachite than I would at Electrum Ruby, but it would take about 60 failed attempts with the gold to equate to the cost of one fail with the ruby. This is the balancing act that you must judge.</p><br>

I have compiled this table as the list of combines that I did on my route to mastery in the cheapest way that I could find. If you have plenty of money to spare, or if you would like to try a different route anyway, here is a trivial table of practically everything up to Platinum Jade. <a href="jewl.txt">Jewellery Trivial List</a> I did not compile this list myself, but unfortunately I cannot recall where I got it from, as it was a long time ago. Still, many thanks to whoever made the list:)<p><br>

<p><img src="bracelet1.jpg" align="left" width="51" height="47"> This is currently where I am up to. I have no experience beyond this level, but this is the table of my planned route to 200. Platinum items do not trivial until after 200, and if you are really serious about making the high end items, then I would suggest that you specialise and try to make it all the way up to 250. Good luck to you all!</p><br>
