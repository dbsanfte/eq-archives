  <p><b>At what level can I start my epic?</b> <br>
  The epic can be &quot;started&quot; at any level, really. &nbsp;The items that you are 
  required to collect drop off various mobs from various zones. &nbsp;However, in 
  order to actually start the epic or do any turn-ins, Sony has stated you are 
  supposed to be level 51 or higher. &nbsp;There are some who have done some key 
  parts (i.e. turn-ins, etc) at level 46, but you run the risk of losing your 
  items if you try this.&nbsp; Of course, you also need proper faction with the 
  various turn-in mobs to ensure success. &nbsp; If your faction or level are not at 
  the appropriate level, the NPC will keep your items.<br>
  <br>
  <b>What factions are required throughout the epic?</b> <br>
  The following factions are required if you are to successfully complete your 
  epic: <br>
&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
    <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/faction.html?faction=68" target="_blank">
    Faydark's Champions</a> </li>
    <li>
    <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/faction.html?faction=67" target="_blank">
    Soldiers of Tunare</a> </li>
    <li>
    <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/faction.html?faction=57" target="_blank">
    Storm Guard</a> </li>
    <li>
    <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/faction.html?faction=56" target="_blank">
    Kaladim Merchants</a> (for Kenlo Strongarm -- Jade Reaver) </li>
    <li>
    <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/faction.html?faction=22" target="_blank">
    Keepers of the Art</a><br>
&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Factions can be adjusted accordingly by following the
  <a href="http://www.eqdruids.com/epic_quests/faction_fix.htm">EQDruids Faction 
  Fixing Guide</a> <br>
  <br>
  <b>Why won't Telin Darkforest wont talk to me?</b> <br>
  Telin Darkforest will not talk to you unless you are of level 51 or higher. 
  &nbsp;Also, you have to make sure your faction is at the right level before trying 
  to talk to him. &nbsp;Some say they can be dubious and he will not talk, but saying 
  &quot;What Action&quot; to him still results in the start of the epic. &nbsp;If you hail him 
  and he will not speak to you (or says something rude), you need to do the 
  Muffins for Pandos quest in Freeport. &nbsp;<b>NOTE:</b> If you have done the Jogle 
  Honeybugger quest (&quot;the band aid quest&quot;) in Misty Thicket, you might have 
  problems purchasing muffins in Freeport. &nbsp;If this is the case, simply buy the 
  muffins elsewhere., such as EC. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Niola Impholder won't accept my batwings. &nbsp;What should I do?</b> <br>
  Niola Impholder is on the Keepers of the Art Faction. &nbsp;She will not accept the 
  batwings from you if you're not at least apprehensive. &nbsp;If you are dubious to 
  her, however, you can simply use Wolf Form. &nbsp;Wolf form raise you one &quot;faction 
  level&quot; (i.e. if you're dubious, you will be apprehensive in Wolf Form). <br>
  <br>
  <b>How many batwings or muffins can I hand in at a time?</b> <br>
  You used to be able to turn in 16 batwings (or muffins) at a time; 4 stacks 
  with 4 in each stack. &nbsp;However, Sony recently changed the turn-in process for 
  NPCs. &nbsp;NPCs will now only acknowledge one of the stacked items in each &quot;give&quot; 
  slot. &nbsp;For example, if you turn in 4 stacks of 4 batwings to Niola Impholder, 
  you will only see 4 sets of faction messages; thus wasting the other 12 
  batwings. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Where does Faelin Bloodbriar spawn?</b> <br>
  Faeline Bloodbriar spawns at
  <a target="_blank" href="epic_faq_pics/FaelineSpawn1.jpg">1500, 500</a> in 
  Greater Faydark (near Orc Hill). &nbsp;It was believed that you have to kill every 
  orc pawn in the zone in order to get her to spawn but this is untrue. &nbsp;All you 
  have to do is kill on orc pawn that spawns on
  <a target="_blank" href="epic_faq_pics/FaelineSpawn1.jpg">this very spot</a>. 
  &nbsp;He is on an 8 to 10 minute time and will faithfully spawn on that spot. &nbsp;It 
  is unclear if Faeline will spawn at the end of the timer or not. &nbsp;Some have 
  seen her spawn as soon as 3 minutes after the PH is killed. <br>
  <br>
  <b>What is the spawn time on Dolgin Codslayer?</b> <br>
  Dolgin Codslayer (the Faydedar trigger in Timorous Deep, hidden Oasis) is on a 
  static 12 hour timer; give or take an hour. &nbsp;There was some question as to his 
  timer based on success or failure of a Faydedar encounter, but this is not 
  true. <br>
  <br>
  <b>What items in the epic can be multi-quested?</b> <br>
  The general rule for multi-questing is that anything requiring NPC-only 
  turn-in can be multi-quested. &nbsp;The only consideration to be aware of is the 
  person MQ'ing an item with you must have the same correct faction with the 
  turn-in NPC. &nbsp;Most of the items in the Druid Epic are single turn-ins (i.e. 
  only one item required) so there's not much chance for multi-questing. &nbsp;The 
  following items can be multi-quested:<br>
&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Softly Glowing Stone (results from hardened mixture turn-in)/Pulsing 
    Green Stone (dropped off VSR). &nbsp;NPC is Foloal Stormforest in Firiona Vie
    </li>
    <li>Cleansed spirits. &nbsp;Each of the cleansed spirits requires drops off 
    &quot;corrupted&quot; mobs in various zones. &nbsp;These items can be multi-quested to 
    receive the one item which eventually results in the cleansed spirit. &nbsp;<b>NOTE:</b> 
    &nbsp;The Cleansed Sprit of Kunark turn-in requires that only the items off the 
    corrupted mobs in Kunark be turned in. &nbsp;There is no &quot;intermediate&quot; item 
    (like the gleaming unicorn horn). </li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Where do I find the Human Skeleton?</b> <br>
  The human skeleton spawns in Frontier Mountains. &nbsp;His actual spawn spot and 
  time are unknown. &nbsp;He has been spotted in various parts of the zone. &nbsp;The best 
  thing to do here is to get a cleric or necro (someone who can Sense the Dead) 
  to locate him for you. &nbsp;It can be tough to find him, however, because his 
  pathing will march him straight into a hill and he tends to get stuck. &nbsp;You 
  will also have to deal with adds along the way so using camo/invis is the way 
  to go. <br>
  <br>
  <b>What do I do with the Shiny Tin Bowl after I make the hardened mixture?</b>
  <br>
  You can simply destroy the bowl after the mixture is completed. &nbsp;It is not 
  needed for any other part of the Druid Epic. &nbsp;It IS needed, however, for the 
  Ranger epic. &nbsp;Ranger epic is the same up to this point and Rangers should have 
  this bowl already to trigger Jahled the Wretched in The Hole. &nbsp;BUT, if the 
  encounter results in failure, the shiny tin bowl is lost and the Ranger must 
  start the epic over. &nbsp;Druids who have this bowl can simply re-trigger Jahled 
  so the Ranger doesn't have to repeat the whole epic. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Does the &quot;spawned&quot; Venril Sathir drop the Pulsing Green Stone?</b> <br>
  No. &nbsp;The pulsing green stone only drops off the triggered Venril Sathir (the 
  one &quot;resurrected&quot; from Venril Sathir Remains) but he drops two. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Does the triggered Venril Sathir proc a life tap?</b> <br>
  The triggered VS will proc a life tap, but it is very infrequent and not 
  nearly as much of a hassle as the timed-spawn.&nbsp; There were mixed reports about 
  whether or not he actually did do a lifetap; however, it has been confirmed 
  that if the fight lasts long enough, you have the chance of seeing him 
  actually lifetap a couple of times.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Why won't Farios Elianos talk to me?</b> <br>
  He doesn't usually speak at all unless you hand him the crushed pot (which you 
  receive from Arlik Farsight in Timorous Deep). &nbsp;He's pretty rude and sarcastic 
  so you wouldn't really want to speak to him anyway ;). &nbsp;He is on The Keepers 
  of the Arts faction, as is Arlik. &nbsp;if Arlik gives you the crushed pot, you are 
  ok to do the turn-in with Farios. &nbsp;If not, you need to do more batwings with 
  Niola Impholder. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Which brownie will spawn the tainted brownie?</b> <br>
  There are 3 brownie scouts who wander the Lesser Faydark zone. &nbsp;They spawn at 
  0,0 and each walks his own path. &nbsp;Killing any of the 3 will spawn the tainted. 
  &nbsp;In fact, it is entirely possible to have 3 tainted brownies running in the 
  zone at the same time. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Where does Faydedar spawn?</b> <br>
  Faydedar spawns in the water, near the ramp in Hidden Oasis (click
  <a target="_blank" href="epic_faq_pics/FaySpawnSpot.jpg">here</a> for a 
  picture). &nbsp;Once the turn-in is complete, he will spawn and swim around a 
  little, then come out of the water. &nbsp;It is best to have your main tank(s) sit 
  near the bushes next to the ramp. &nbsp;He will exit the water and immediately 
  attack the sitters. &nbsp;All others on the raid should be standing. <br>
  <br>
  <b>How come my nukes do not land on Faydedar?</b> <br>
  In order for any nukes to land, you must be within melee range. &nbsp;Otherwise, 
  the spells will be resisted. &nbsp;He is a fire-based mob so the likelihood of him 
  resisting fire-based spells is quite high. &nbsp;It is best to use cold-based 
  spells. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Why did Faydedar immediately attack my casters and ignored my sitting tank?</b>
  <br>
  Two possibilities can cause this to happen: 1) He hit the tanks, causing them 
  to stand but there were casters sitting at the time of the spawn. &nbsp;2) You had 
  people on the raid who were fairly low level (less than 46). &nbsp;Faydedar is 
  identical to Naggy (except he looks like salamander with no hind legs...lol) 
  and will attack anyone lower than level 46. &nbsp;He will definitely attack all 
  those who are sitting, so everyone must be standing when you do your turn-in.&nbsp; 
  There is also some indication that he hates illusions so Wolf Form or 
  elemental illusions (used by Enchanters and Mages) will most likely aggro him 
  as well. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Can my raid use pets to kill Faydedar?</b> <br>
  Yes. &nbsp;The only consideration here is to make sure the pet's taunt is turned 
  off (&quot;/pet taunt off&quot;). &nbsp;Other than that, pets are great for this encounter, 
  specifically necro and mage pets (certain pets have the ability to stun). <br>
  <br>
  <b>Does the &quot;real&quot; Faydedar drop the seawater?</b> <br>
  Yes. &nbsp;The timed Faydedar will drop the seawater. &nbsp;However, the chances of you 
  finding him are slim to none. &nbsp;He spawns in the firepot room and will sit for 
  a little bit, after which time he ventures out. &nbsp;His pathing takes him close 
  to the Iksar Master (he sits atop a big rock near Chessboard) who proceeds to 
  run down to him and literally beat him to death. &nbsp;The Iksar Master loses about 
  half health but he's highly magic resistant so the damage he takes is purely 
  from melee. &nbsp;If you have the chance to see this fight, do so. &nbsp;It's been 
  reported as being &quot;fascinating&quot;. &nbsp;Just make sure you don't get too close and 
  stay invis'd -- everyone except Iksar Monks are KOS to him. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Why didn't the corrupted aqua goblin shaman drop the water?</b> <br>
  You can sometimes get many tainted/corrupted aqua goblin shamans to spawn at 
  this camp, however, they don't all drop the water. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Why didn't the tainted barracuda spawn the corrupted barracuda?</b> <br>
  Same thing as the aqua goblin shaman...the corrupted barracuda will spawn many 
  times, but will not drop the water off every one. &nbsp;However, you can tell which 
  one will drop the water by pulling the tainted out of the lake. &nbsp;If it follows 
  you on land, the corrupted will spawn and drop the water. <br>
  <br>
  <b>What is the spawn time on Athele in East Karana?</b> <br>
  Athele is on a 2 hour timer (real-time). &nbsp;This is whether or not she gets 
  killed. &nbsp;If the Dark Elf Reavers reach the druids and kill her, she will 
  return in approximately 2 hours. &nbsp;If you turn in the fleshbound tome to her, 
  she will despawn and return in 2 hours. <br>
  <br>
  <b>I've killed the Millers. &nbsp;Can I still do my epic?</b> <br>
  Absolutely. &nbsp;Being KOS to the Millers will not hurt your epic in any way. 
  &nbsp;However, you might have some issues in various zones (i.e. Qeynos Guards, 
  etc). &nbsp;Being KOS to the Millers WILL hurt the Paladin epic because they are on 
  the Priests of Life faction (Qeynos Pally guild). <br>
  <br>
  <b>I am KOS to Kaladim. &nbsp;How do I turn in my jade reaver?</b> <br>
  You can invis yourself and get to Kenlo Strongarm in Kaladim with no problem; 
  however, because Sony nerfed the ability to turn items in while invis, you 
  might have a problem here. &nbsp;One thing you can do is have an enchanter charm 
  him so you can do the turn-in. &nbsp;The best thing to do is find the crazed 
  goblins in Butcher Block Mountains and camp them for a while. &nbsp;You should be 
  able to raise your faction enough to where you are dubious (and dubious is all 
  that is needed). <br>
  <br>
  <b>Where does the tainted gorilla spawn?</b> <br>
  The tainted gorilla spawns in the northwest corner of Emerald Jungle, right 
  around the area at the top of the stairs. &nbsp;He has a tottering gorilla as his 
  placeholder, but only a live one. &nbsp;The undead ones (who look really gross) 
  will not spawn the tainted. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Neither The Withered Treant nor Xanusuus Treant will respond to my hails. 
  &nbsp;What do I do?</b> <br>
  If you want to hail these two, you have to get VERY close to them -- almost to 
  the point where you see nothing but treant bark on your screen...lol...they 
  are old and hard of hearing. ;). &nbsp;But you can simply hand in the items to them 
  and you will be fine. &nbsp;Dubious or better faction has been reported as all that 
  is needed for these turn-ins (druids should rarely have lower than indifferent 
  faction with these two unless you've been naughty ;) ). <br>
  <br>
  <b>Can I just have an enchanter make me the Enchanted Clay?<br>
  </b>Unfortunately, the enchanted clay used for the epic is not the same that 
  is the result of an enchanter casting the Enchant Clay spell.&nbsp; Although they 
  have the same name, the one for the druid epic is completely different (for 
  one thing, it is NO DROP)</td>
