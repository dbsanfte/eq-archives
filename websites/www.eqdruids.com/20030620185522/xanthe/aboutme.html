<font size=+1><i>Greetings friend:) Have you been wondering about who Xanthe Ravenwolf really is? What makes her tick? How she got to be so incredibly wonderful and also attractive?<p><br>

What do you mean "No"?.....<p><br>

Oh well, for all those of you who want to know a little more about me, and for those of you who don't have anything better to do right now, here is a little page just about me.<br> And for those of you looking for the tailoring section, you're in the wrong place, go back to the main page....:)<p><br></i>

Anyway, about me.<p><br>


<p><img src="xanthepic.jpg" align="left" width="800" height="600">
This is me.<p><br><br>

Hierophant of our blessed mother Tunare, I am currently of the 61st Sunrise I spend my time on Bertoxxulous server and am currently a member of the most excellent guild Ascending Phoenix.<p><br>

As far as i can recall, my earliest interest in trade skills was as my ranger, Treye, who was my very first character on my fiance's account. Treye, like a lot of rangers, liked the idea of fletching although that didnt go too well for him, but since that fateful day I have been hooked. Since then I have mastered every trade skill, purely for the love of it, but more than anything else I like to consider myself a Tailor, as it is the one that I love the best (and also hate, as many other tailors may tell you:) <p><br>


I would like to take the opportunity here to thank my numerous good friends both within and without my guild, just for being good mates. I would also like to thank my RL fiance Rainaer (63rd Sorcerer), for putting up with me spending all evening trolling through vendors and randomly shrieking "Ooh I need that for Tailoring!" while he is hunting stuff, and giving him a heart attack. I also want to thank him for making me the happiest woman alive, and to tell him that I love him more than anything in the world, even EverQuest.<p>
And if you want to be sick, there is a bin in that corner you can use....<p><br>

For those of you who really want to know, and also so I can keep track of them, my skills are:<p><br>
Baking 250<br>
Brewing 250<br>
Fletching 250<br>
Jewellery 250<br>
Pottery 250<br>
Smithing 217<br>
Tailoring 250<br><br>

On Bertoxx I also have several alts who I occasionally play, including a Necro, Warrior, Monk, Enchanter, Ranger and Rogue.<p><br>

And for those of you who want to know who I <i>really</i> am....<p><br>

<p><img src="xantheme.jpg" align="left" width="339" height="416">
This is me posing.<p><br> I am currently 22 years old, a student taking Biology at Sussex University, and living in England. I enjoy roleplaying, wargaming and EverQuest, and also staying in bed until unreasonable hours whenever the opportunity presents itself.<p><br>

If you have found this site useful, or possibly even entertaining (even if it was only to laugh at my picture), please take a moment to sign the Guestbook and tell me about it, it's the feedback that really does make it all worth the while:) Happy Trade Skills!</font><p><br><br><br><br><br>
