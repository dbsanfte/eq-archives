        <font face="Arial">With this patch we introduced the ability for 
        intelligence casters (Enchanters, Magicians, Necromancers and Wizards) 
        to create additional spell scrolls using their research skill. Many of 
        the newly researchable spells have only been available from quests or 
        killing NPCs in the past. The new research still requires components 
        from risky locations or dangerous foes. Our goal is to increase the 
        number of ways to earn rare spells, without reducing the challenge 
        required. <br>
        <br>
        This, however, creates a bit of an inequity between the intelligence 
        casters and the priest classes (Clerics, Druids and Shaman) when it 
        comes to acquiring this type of spell. While there is nothing inherently 
        wrong with different classes earning their spells in different ways, we 
        don't see a reason to give more options to one type of caster than 
        another. In this case, we have taken the opportunity to give the 
        research skill a little more value and at the same time negate any 
        imbalance between classes. <br>
        <br>
        Some time in the near future we plan to introduce recipes for the 
        creation of certain spells for the priest classes. Intelligence casters 
        can use their research skill to create these priest spell scrolls, and 
        priest classes will benefit by having an alternate method for obtaining 
        these spells. This helps out both priests and intelligence casters, and 
        creates a new niche for research as a trade skill. <br>

        *** The Legacy of Ykesha is now live! ***<br>
        <br>
        As the afternoon heat grows, a trickle of adventurous folk can be seen 
        moving through the rocky vales of the mountains called Stonebrunt. These 
        quiet lands, normally inhabited by panda bears and kobolds, are slowly 
        becoming a throughway for heroes, mercenaries and adventures of all 
        races. Are you one of them?<br>
        <br>
        And in Gukta tadpoles are growing into young Frogloks. There is no doubt 
        in the minds of the conquerors of Grobb that the new generation of their 
        people will grow into strong and steadfast servants of Mithaniel Marr, 
        worthy of his respect. Will you be one of them?<br>
        <br>
        OOC: Have fun with the new features, the new race and the new zones. 
        Thank you for playing EverQuest.<br>
        <br>
        ** Gameplay **<br>
        <br>
        We've adjusted the entry requirements for some Planes of Power zones. 
        Several of these zones required each character to complete a quest 
        before gaining entry. We've relaxed this requirement somewhat as 
        follows:<br>
        <br>
        * A raid with 32 or more members can enter a locked plane provided that 
        85% of the raiders have finished the entry quest. This means a raid 
        group can bring along some friends who haven't completed the quest.<br>
        <br>
        * Characters who haven't done the entry quest must stay with their raid 
        while they are in the locked zone. If these characters leave the raid 
        for more than three minutes, they will be transported out to the Plane 
        of Tranquility.<br>
        <br>
        * Using this method does not grant permanent access to the locked zone. 
        If a character wants permanent, unescorted access to a locked zone then 
        they must still complete the quest. The goal of this change is to allow 
        raiding groups to bring along a few friends who haven't been able to 
        complete the quests, but still wish to help with the raid.<br>
        <br>
        - Several of the flagging events will now only give out a maximum of 72 
        flags each time they are completed.<br>
        - The dialogue boxes for resurrection and translocation will remain for 
        5 minutes instead of 1 hour.<br>
        - Increased the maximum number of members on ignore and friends lists to 
        100.<br>
        - Made some adjustments to the Halls of Honor alternate entry quest that 
        should make it more friendly.<br>
        - The horse buff icon will no longer show up for characters using 
        non-Luclin models.<br>
        <br>
        ** Interface **<br>
        <br>
        - Containers now close after zoning. This prevents a bug that was 
        causing the same container to be opened twice.<br>
        - The rogue hide message &quot;You have moved and are no longer hidden!&quot; is 
        filtered as a &quot;skill&quot; message and not an &quot;other&quot; message.<br>
        - Fixed a bug that was causing the spell effects opacity slider to 
        always return to 0% when logging out to the desktop.<br>
        <br>
        ** Items **<br>
        <br>
        - Happy Dragon should no longer use a charge when the target is out of 
        range.<br>
        - The inventory icons for Trydan's Greaves of Nobility, Deathwatch Sword 
        and Wetfang Steak have been corrected.<br>
        - Corrected the name of the Drakescale Covered Tunic (was Drakscale 
        Covered Tunic).<br>
        - The Manicle of Disruption has been renamed Manacle of Disruption.<br>
        - See above for Vorshar's Manicle of the Blight.<br>
        - Corrected the spelling of Golden Idol of Rodcef Nife.<br>
        - The Rantho Rapier is now a piercing weapon, not a two-hand slashing 
        weapon.<br>
        - The Wand of Mana Tapping is no longer labeled as usable in the 
        secondary hand (since it is Enchanter only and could not be used there 
        anyhow).<br>
        <br>
        ** Quests **<br>
        <br>
        - Made a change to the way Planes of Power spell quests work. All spells 
        usable by more than one class are now obtained from the same level 
        quest. If a spell is level 61 (Ethereal) for one class and level 65 
        (Rune Word) for another, both will have it as a reward on their Ethereal 
        quest.<br>
        - Corrected issues with the quest from the Iksar Hermit.<br>
        - Corrected a grammatical error in some of Bolli Hillfoot's text.<br>
        - Marshal Anrey should be more responsive when talked to.<br>
        - The &quot;Bag of Troll guts&quot; is now dropping off of the correct NPC.<br>
        <br>
        ** Zones and NPCs**<br>
        <br>
        - Removed the ability for PCs to bind in the upper tier Planes of Power 
        zones. Binding is allowed in Plane of Knowledge and Plane of 
        Tranquility.<br>
        - The entrance to the Plane of Fire now requires the appropriate keys 
        for entry.<br>
        - Gods in the elemental planes now have fixed respawn regardless of zone 
        outages. If the god in an elemental plane is up when the zone comes down 
        it will still be up when the zone comes back up. If it has two days left 
        before its respawn when the zone comes down it will still respawn in two 
        days.<br>
        - Prior to this patch Rallos Zek was changed, he no longer allows anyone 
        he dislikes to stand above the arena.<br>
        - Removed a &quot;safe spot&quot; from the Plane of Disease.<br>
        - NPCs in the Plane of Justice can no longer be affected by Fear spells.<br>
        - Fixed an issue with some level 10 NPCs in the Karanas having about 400 
        times the hit points that they should.<br>
        - Denizens of Aerin`Dar's lair will no longer be getting angry at folks 
        just because they are stomping around on the ground above the lair.<br>
        - Puslings now understand how to &quot;enrage&quot; properly.<br>
        - Creatures in Fungus Grove will be less likely to ignore people 
        shooting them from a distance.<br>
        - Mature Arboreans are now plants. Just don't call them that to their 
        faces.<br>
        - Giant Whiskered Bats in the Qeynos area no longer drop rat skulls.<br>
        - Dalin Greskar has given up his hobby of trying to sell blacksmithing 
        gear that he doesn't have and has gone legit with pottery supplies.<br>
        - Corrected a typographical error in some of Tarnic McWillows speech.<br>
        - Firon Dernkal will no longer add a random &quot;t&quot; to the end of people's 
        names when talking to them.<br>
        - Corrected an error in Eirod Haerod's text.<br>
        - It seems as though the troll sent to retrieve the Forge from fallen 
        Grobb has returned with Forge in hand.<br>
        - Corrected an issue with the respawn of Fennin Ro.<br>
        - A Kromzek spy will no longer give a &quot;beta neutral&quot; faction hit when 
        killed.<br>
        <br>
        ** Spells **<br>
        <br>
        - Fixed a bug that prevented the owners of charmed warders from 
        controlling or re-summoning their warders after the charm breaks.<br>
        - Disinfecting Aura has been changed to no longer cure poisonous 
        effects. It will now cure disease effects with much more potency.<br>
        - Fixed a bug that was causing Bind Sight to fail to land if the 
        recipient had exactly 15 other buffs.<br>
        - Convergence should not eat its component as often on some types of 
        spell failures.<br>
        - Corrected the spell book icons for several Enchanter spells.<br>
        - Shadeweaver port should no longer place you beneath the world.<br>
        - In a previous update, we added a message when a person recasts a charm 
        spell on their charmed pet. Recasting charm on an existing pet did not 
        actually re-charm the pet, it just failed silently and appeared to 
        succeed. The new message is now displayed intentionally in these cases. 
        This is not a bug.<br>
        <br>
        ** Miscellaneous **<br>
        <br>
        - Attack text for the Vah Shir when punching now says, &quot;punches&quot; instead 
        of &quot;hits&quot;<br>
        - Fixed a bug that was causing the reduced statistics to not update 
        properly when the character has low hit points or is encumbered.<br>
        - Fixed a bug that caused some sale prices for items in the Bazaar 
        (mostly those with a lot of 9s) to be invalid. <br>
        - The /guildmotd command has been modified. Guild leaders and officers 
        can now use this command to set or clear the guild Message of the Day. 
        There is a new command, /getguildmotd, that can be used as an 
        alternative to viewing the Guild MOTD in the Guild Management Window.<br>

  <tr>
        <td height="991">
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">I've now been playing EQOA for about 
        a week now, so I have a bit more knowledge about the game.<br>
        <br>
        So far, this game has been very enjoyable. The graphics aren't as nice 
        as in the PC game, but they did a nice job.<br>
        <br>
        Some thoughts about the game.<br>
        <br>
        There are no zoning. You cross into a different zone without even 
        noticing, so no constant &quot;loading please wait&quot; like in the pc version. 
        However, you can't zone to get rid of a mob either!<br>
        <br>
        Casting while moving! I love this feature. You are running along, start 
        to cast your spell (you slow while casting) and boom spell cast, back to 
        running.<br>
        <br>
        Attacking while casting! You can start a cast of spell, and continue to 
        melee! Very nice feature, allowing for a lot of potential damage.<br>
        <br>
        Only 5 spell slots (abilities) but that hasn't seemed to slow me down 
        much, you will find quickly the spells that you use the most.<br>
        <br>
        Quests are great in the this game in my opinion. I have gotten TONS of 
        experience by doing fairly simple quests. They do grow more complicated 
        as you go, but the rewards and the experience have definitely been worth 
        the time. I've actually gotten almost full levels off a few of the 
        earlier quests.<br>
        <br>
        The controls take a little getting used to, but once you have some 
        rhythms down, you will find it isn't bad to deal with at all.<br>
        <br>
        Coaches are an interesting aspect of the game. Once you visit certain 
        cities, you are able to scribe your name in their coachman's book. Once 
        you have a named scribed, you can ride the &quot;coach&quot; back to that city 
        from another city with a coachman. Saves a LOT of running.<br>
        <br>
        I've only played a druid so far (surprise surprise) but I have noticed 
        that at least for druids, the game is much more melee based than in the 
        PC version. I do a lot of fighting, with spells as a backup. Actually a 
        nice change of pace!<br>
        <br>
        Groups are findable, but I haven't had to really group but one time so 
        far. If you enjoy solo play, you can easily accomplish that in this 
        game. <br>
        <br>
        One thing that you will really want to invest in, is a keyboard. Trying 
        to communicate through the online keypad is just tedious! I found a PS/2 
        compatible keyboard at my local GameSPOT for 20 dollars, so it shouldn't 
        cost you much, and it is well worth it.<br>
        <br>
        Overall, I can sum up this game so far easily. I keep going into the 
        game to play for a &quot;little bit&quot; and find that hours have passed. So to 
        me, that is a good game!<br>
        <br>
        If your local store doesn't have a copy, E-bay has many sellers selling 
        the game. I would look at Bestbuy if you have one, my local store had 
        the game for $39.99.<br>
        <br>
        As I find more, I'll post it. But for now, I give this game a thumbs up.</font></p>

        This is a study on how different proteins work in your system.</p>
        <p>This research could lead to a cure for many types of cancers,

        <p>The way you can help, is using a system called Distributed Computing.&nbsp;

        <p>When your computer is idle, this program downloads chunks of data to 
        analyze, works on that data, and sends the results back to the main

        <p><font face="Arial">The Gulf of Gunthak is the only port on Broken 
        Skull Rock. Every other place where the island meets the water is steep, 
        rocky and exposed to the rough weather. That does not mean Gunthak is an 
        entirely safe harbor, as the shore of the gulf is barren and rocky, and 
        the cliffs beyond the bay are holed with caves. Most of these caves are 
        shallow, but a few of them lead deep into the cliff and open into a 
        rather expansive cavern system.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">This is the gateway to the lair of the Broken 
        Skull Clan. It serves as the home for the newly recruited clan members 
        and temporary housing for anyone that the clan trusts just enough not to 
        kill outright. Anyone wishing to learn about this fierce group of Trolls 
        should start here and, if they are lucky, find the passages into the 
        deeper parts of Broken Skull Rock. Rumors have reached many adventurers 
        that they may find welcome, or at least a safe landing, near the 
        abandoned lighthouse.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial"><b>Dulak's Harbor</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Dulak's Harbor lies in a vast cavern beneath the 
        rocky island. The troll marauders have built their dark, rough town 
        along the calm shores of the harbor. Using whatever they have at hand, 
        the inhabitants are constantly rebuilding and adding to this city. An 
        eerie feeling surrounds the city; a malevolent undercurrent beyond just 
        the unpleasant nature of the creatures living there.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Most of the expected amenities are available here, 
        if you're a member of Clan Broken Skull. Taverns, crew quarters, stores, 
        docks, and shipyards fill the city. Rails can be seen in parts of the 
        city, and following them one way could lead an adventurer to the 
        refinery and the nearby smiths. Luggalds guard the temple, the most 
        unusual and unpleasant building in town. Anyone foolish enough to get 
        close to the temple is engulfed by the palpable fear and hate that seep 
        from within.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial"><b>Torgiran Mines</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Deep inside Broken Skull Rock are the 
        Torgiran Mines, where downtrodden slaves delve into the ore-rich depths 
        of the island. The ore is moved by rail out to Dulak's Harbor, processed 
        in the refinery, and used to create ship's fittings and primitive 
        weapons. The mines themselves occasionally dip below sea level, 
        sometimes even uncovering lava pools. The Luggald have erected shrines 
        and etched mystic runes in the mines, which seem to prevent them from 
        flooding.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial"><b>Crypt of Nadox</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Hidden in the bowels of Broken Skull 
        Rock lies the Crypt of Nadox. The tomb of the ancient Troll shaman Nadox 
        is hidden within these caverns bearing his name. Filled with various 
        shrines and temples to honor the god of the Broken Skull Clan, the crypt 
        is a dangerous place to any who venture there. Only the most powerful of 
        the clan are allowed into the crypt, and they guard the area with fierce 
        devotion.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial"><b>Hate's Fury</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">It is rumored that there is a hidden 
        lagoon in the Crypt of Nadox where the leader of the clan keeps his 
        ship. Of course they also say that the ship is filled with ill-gotten 
        booty that the various troll pirate captains have gathered up over the 
        ages. The name of this legendary ship is well known by those that sail 
        the seas, and can be heard on the lips of members of the Broken Skull 
        Marauders. Most sailors understand that such a ship is probably merely a 
        rumor, invented over a foamy mug of ale in a dockside tavern.</font></p>

        day bright!!</font><p><font face="Arial">From EQLive:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Charms can take many forms. They can be broaches, 
        cape clasps, pendants and other such adornments. They vary in 
        appearance, but they all share one property. Charms are more than just 
        simple magic items. They interact with the world around them and often 
        with their owner. Charms are aware of their surroundings, at least in 
        some limited way. This limited perception is usually directed, or aimed 
        at a specific purpose, though that is not always the case.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A charm, for example, may have been created by a 
        druid after a lifetime of battles with the forces of Blackburrow or the 
        Coldpaw Clan. She may have imbued her charms with the power to grant 
        strength to those that kill her lifelong enemies, and that strength may 
        grow with the owner's dedication to the charm's cause. Or perhaps there 
        is an ancient Dwarven charm, blessed by Brell, that grants a boon - but 
        only to Dwarves.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">And of course there are rumors that some of these 
        charms only work with arms or armor created by the same weapon or armor 
        smith, and that their magic grows stronger with every piece of the armor 
        set the owner wears.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Charms are an entirely new breed of magical items 
        that are aware of certain situations and conditions around them. Some 
        even believe that the magic in them is alive, given the way they seem to 
        react differently to each owner. We've discovered three example charms 
        to show you. Unlike the fictitious charms mentioned above, these charms 
        might just resemble what you can find in Norrath:</font></p>

        having no hair.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Fixed a bug that caused merchants to charge a little extra or 
        less (1 copper).</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Merchants will no longer claim that they will pay 1 copper for 
        starting equipment (they have never actually purchased such items).</normal>

        Some Planar Tailoring can only be done in the Tanaan Loom as opposed to 
        the Planar Sewing Kit. Nothing that was previously made in the Loom was 
        added to the collapsible tailoring kit. Skills changed were Baking, 
        Sewing, Jewel Craft, and Fletching.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Added gnome cultural recipe book to Ak'Anon.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Changed the weights on Spiritstones to be more in line with 
        Faithstones.</normal> <br>

        <normal>-Rallos Zek now moves considerably faster then before, as do his 
        cohorts. He will also become very, VERY angry should he be removed from

        <br>
        <normal>- Skyshrine will once again require a key for exit into the 
        Cobalt Scar. The fact that the key was not needed was a bug. We do 
        understand that few people actually walk through this area considering 
        the other methods of transport available, but the dragons aren't leaving 
        their doors open.</normal> <br>

  <tr>
        <td><font face="Arial">With the patch on February 4th we fixed a bug 
        with Affliction foci, but we failed to mention it in the patch message. 
        We corrected a bug that was allowing these foci to work for too many 
        spell types, including things like snares and slow. Affliction foci now 
        only work on damage over time spells. <br>
        <br>
        We apologize for not mentioning this fix in the patch message. <br>
        <br>
        The very high savings in cast time and mana, as well as the extended 
        duration, were planned to only work on damage over time spells. These 
        spells needed more help than all other detrimental spells. The 
        affliction foci for haste and mana are dramatically better (more than 
        twice as effective) than other items of the type. The extension focus is 
        better than any other as well, though not to such a degree. These items 
        are only so much better than others because they were intended only to 
        improve the effect of damage over time spells to bolster their value.
        <br>
        <br>
        We fixed a similar bug in June of 2002. Some time between then and now 
        the bug resurfaced. The bug was fixed while another was being addressed, 
        and because it wasn't the targeted bug fix it didn't make it into the 
        patch message. We certainly wouldn't have left this information out on 
        purpose. <br>
        <br>
        We understand that this change has an effect on some players. But these 
        foci have always been intended to work exclusively on DoT spells, and we 
        do not plan to undo the bug fix. We'll look at other detrimental spells 
        and see if there are some lines that should benefit from similar focus 
        items, but that will be done on a case-by-case basis and not by 
        reverting this recent bug fix. </font></td>
