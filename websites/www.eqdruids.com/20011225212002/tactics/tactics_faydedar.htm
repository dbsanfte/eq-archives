  <b><font size="2">I write this summary in the hopes that it will aid
  you in your fight with<br>
  Faydedar. I do not claim that this is the only way to battle him. I do<br>
  hope that my advice will help improve your odds of being successful when he
  finally does spawn. I would also like to thank those that have done such
  notable work in the initial research of our epic quest. </font> </b>
  </div>
  <p align="justify"><b><font size="2">I have been involved with four fights with the elusive Faydedar, and this
  is
  a compellation of what I have learned in those encounters. If you have not
  yet printed yourself a map of Timorous Deep I strongly recommend you do
  before going any farther. Next, I recommend that you have an
  &quot;assister&quot;
  available who can help you on short notice. This person can be a fellow
  druid, a bard or a ranger. </font> </b>
  <p align="justify"><b><font size="2">1) In every case the bait left at the spires at (approx) neg 12,200 pos<br>
  4,200 (or the druid waiting) has been attacked. It did not matter if the<br>
  person was levitated at the top or sitting at the water line, or which arm<br>
  of the spire s/he was sitting on. </font> </b>
  <p align="justify"><b><font size="2">2) To successfully kite Faydedar you need to have as much resist magic and
  (secondary) resist fire gear on as you can muster. Next you should have 6
  dummy buffs up, then RM, sow (or wolf form), and finally levitate. If you
  are fortunate enough to have J-boots then put this buff up first and have it
  hot keyed. Faydedar breathes an aoe debuff with fire and fear. Make sure
  you are bound at the docks in Oasis. </font> </b>
  <p align="justify"><b><font size="2">3) If you are sitting there with your druid go to step 6.
  </font> </b>
  <p align="justify"><b><font size="2">4) Upon your bait dieing, pick up your assister and get to the succor in<br>
  point (the chessboard). Have the assister stand at the base of the hill<br>
  that the Iksar master is on. His job is to pick Faydedar up on tracking and
  intercept him if you are unable to find him. </font> </b>
  <p align="justify"><b><font size="2">5) Look for Faydedar between the spires and the Raptor Islands. He travels
  very slowly so if you start a grid pattern you should pick him up on track
  in short order. If you fail to find him, no worries, your assister will
  pick him up on track eventually at the Iksar master. </font> </b>
  <p align="justify"><b><font size="2">6) You now have Faydedar on track and in your sights. There is no need to
  cast anything on him. He will agro on you as soon as he is in range of you.
  Keep Faydedar on track at all times. This will tell you if you have out ran
  him. (instead of being behind he'll start showing as behind left etc) The
  chances are slim on this, but better to be safe then sorry. Lead (kite :P )
  Faydedar to the elven island (neg 4,000, neg 6,000) This is a bit of a run
  and takes a few minutes. You want to kite him there as there are only elves
  on the island (non agro to you and Faydedar) and it has the largest open
  area for kiting. Kite him only on the north-east side of the island in a
  nice oval loop. At this point you only care about 2 of your buffs. Keep up
  one dummy buff (something fast to cast like see invis) and either sow or
  wolf form. If you are fortunate enough to have J-boots you don't need to
  keep any buffs up. I have kited Faydedar in this manner for 7 hours with no
  trouble and no de-spawn. (a fungi tunic also helps but is not necessary)
  </font> </b>
  <p align="justify"><b><font size="2">7) While you are kiting your &quot;assister&quot; should be sitting at the
  elven<br>
  docks. His job is to sit there and cover incase you die, go LD, crash or<br>
  what ever. If for some reason you don't have an &quot;assister&quot; and die,
  you are
  bound at the docks in Oasis. Zone back in and egress (succor). I would
  recommend leaving a /dueled corpse at the egress point with 8 stacks of bat
  wings on it. This allows you to loot one stack of bat wings, re-levitate,
  and go back to the spires - and back to step number four. (Twice after
  dieing at the elven island (no comment about LD) Faydedar went back to the
  spires before resuming his normal journey) </font> </b>
  <p align="justify"><b><font size="2">8) Fighting Faydedar: Do NOT be mislead that Faydedar is easy to kill. He
  is tougher then Nagafen. Take at least five groups of people. Make sure
  they are balanced and that you have some warriors 55 plus. I have seen
  Faydedar wipe out 4 groups of people where half were lvl 55 plus and then
  poof. I'm sure your guild is ub3r and l33t, but after spending X hundred
  hours camping him, do you want to have him wipe you out because the casters
  ping ponged him or something else stupid and poof? </font> </b>
  <p align="justify"><b><font size="2">9) Get your friends, guildmates and whoever else you can to the succor<br>
  point. The fastest way into Timorous Deep is via the barge in Oasis. Have
  your party meet at the chessboard, form groups and buff. Their last buff
  should be levitate/dmf. When they are fully buffed have them go due East to
  neg 6,000 neg 6,000 and meet at the large stone eagle. It is easier for
  them to move to you then for you, or someone with levitate to try and kite
  him over to the chessboard. As well, if you fight at the chessboard and
  loose he's 50 yards from the Iksar master L and you will have almost no
  chance of a second try. If you do loose go back to step four. </font> </b>
  <p align="justify"><b><font size="2">There it is. I believe I've covered everything, though I'm sure someone<br>
  will add to this. I personally sat at the spires for 308 hours waiting for
  Faydedar. In all, I spent 418 hours before I was finally able to complete the
  druid epic quest, and receive my epic weapon. I have read others that
  completed it in a few days (cough), but would suggest that you can expect to
  spend some 'epic' time to complete this, probably<br>
  around 200 hours. </font> </b>
