<p><img src="pietin.jpg" align="left" width="50" height="47">This is a really nice trade skill to do. (And yes, there is the ubiquitous pie tin icon again). Not only is it relaxing, it’s also very easy to do. Most of the bits you need can be bought from a vendor, and MOST importantly you gain skill extremely quickly all the way up to mastery and beyond.</p>

For those poor (literally), frustrated, suicidal Smiths out there who in the last 50 combines haven’t seen the golden “You have improved your skill at Blacksmithing”, this is a real tonic. You can make lots of nice bowls and things, and you will gain a skill point on roughly every other combine that you do. Trust me, it will make you a lot happier:)<p><br>

<p><img src="pietin.jpg" align="left" width="50" height="47"> With regards to location, I do all of my pottery in North Freeport (Halas is good too). The clay can be bought from Groflah’s Forge near the Bard Guild, water from several shops near the bank, sketches from the shop adjoining the bank, and there is a pottery wheel in the bank area.</p>

To find it face away from the door of the bank and walk forward until you are at the gap in the wall near the Jade Tiger building. Before you walk through the gap turn left. Then walk forward until you hit the pottery wheel. The kiln is right next to the wheel, as it will be wherever you do your pottery.<p><br>

<p><img src="pietin.jpg" align="left" width="50" height="47"> For those of you who have never seen a pottery wheel before, here is a <a href="kilnwheel.jpg">picture</a>. To open it, left click on it. The same goes for the kiln (picture - not here yet).</p><br>

<b><u><font size=+1>Making an Item</font></b></u><p>

In pottery, there are two stages to making a finished item.<p>

The first stage is forming the shape out of clay. This is done in the Pottery Wheel. The trivial level for an item refers to making this part of the item. Firing the item in the kiln is always easier than making the first part on the Pottery Wheel.<p><br>

<img src="potwheelopen.jpg" width="119" height="389"><p><br>

As always, <b>NEVER</b> stack items in the combining container, and <b>NEVER</b> use Summoned or Foraged water, it just won’t work.<p><br>

<b>The First Stage requires:</b><p>

1 water (flask, store bought)<p>
1 sketch (pattern)<p>
Clay (various sizes and number of pieces required, depending on the item being made)<p>
For more complex items sometimes a glass shard, an animal skin or metal bits from Smithing might also be needed.<p>

All of these things are placed into the pottery wheel, and then you press combine. If you are unsuccessful all the items will disappear and you will be told you have failed.
If you succeed you will now hold on your mouse pointer an Unfired Item.<p><br>

Vendors will not buy Unfired Items, so don’t even bother trying it. Unfired Items will also not work as part of another recipe. For instance if you are baking a pie, you need a pie tin as part of the recipe. If you try to use and Unfired Pie Tin, the recipe will not work, and you will lose all of your items. This leads us to…<p><br>

<b>The Second Stage -Firing the Unfired Items</b><p>

This stage uses the Kiln, and requires:<p>

<img src="kilnopen.jpg" width="117" height="390"><p><br>

1 Unfired Item<p>
Firing Sheet(s) of varying quality.<p><br>

Firing Sheets and Glass Shards are not available inside Freeport itself, but can be found at the first Inn in East Commons, approaching from the West Freeport side of the zone. The vendor is Merra Clayfinger, and he is in one of the outside huts at the inn, rather than the main building. He sells clay, Glass Shards, Firing Sheets of various quality, and vial sketches.<p>

The Unfired Item and the appropriate Firing Sheets are put into the kiln, and then you press combine. If you succeed you will end up with shiny new ceramic item, which may then be used for something else.<p><br>

<img src="pietin.jpg" align="left" width="50" height="47"> Many baking utensils are made via the pottery skill, as are Poison Vials for the rogue poison making skill, and for the production of various Vials of Mana using the Enchanter line of spells.</p><br>

<b>A note</b> on Firing vs Destroying – Depending on how you like to do your trade skills you have two options after you have completed the first stage.<p>

You can fire the item, or you can destroy it.<p>

If you fire the item you can then sell it on to a vendor and recoup some of the costs. Having said that, pottery is not overly expensive to do, and if you are working in Freeport, you will spend a LOT of time going back and forth to East Commons for the Firing Sheets (they don’t stack).<p>

I personally destroyed everything without ever firing a single item, except for the vials later on, which I have use for (and which are more expensive to make). Destroying unfired items will save you a lot of time. Also, some of the items like jars and mixing bowls take up a whole General Inventory slot once they have been fired, as they are containers. This would mean that you would have to have some free slots, and go sell the finished items as you make them. This also takes a lot of time.<p><br>

*Glass Shards do not stack. This part can be time consuming. If you have a lot of pelts to spare you might want to skip this part and move on to vials.<br><p>

** Most pelts can be used for this, as long as they are NOT Ruined, ie. You can use a Low Quality Cat Pelt, but not a Ruined Cat pelt. Puma Skins work, as do Black Wolf Skins and Zombie Skins (these stack, which can save a lot of room). Lion Skins DON’T work, and neither do Snake Skins or Shadow Wolf Pelts.. Up until now the new Velious Pelts such as Cougar, Dire Wolf, Kodiak etc don’t work either, but I shall do more testing with these to see if it has changed since I last checked.<br><p><br>
