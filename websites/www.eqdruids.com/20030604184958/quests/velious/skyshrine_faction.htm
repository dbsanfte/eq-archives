  You say, 'hail Sentry Emil' <br>
  <br>
  Sentry Emil says 'Ah, hello, you must be the strangers that call yourselves 
  friend to the Kin. Perhaps you would be interested in proving your worth? <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'i am interested in proving my worth' <br>
  <br>
  Sentry Emil says 'Good, then perhaps you wouldn't mind performing a small task 
  then? With the betrayal of Kragen Morshire, the kin retreated from the 
  Skyshrine and have taken up residence in the Tunare Court. Before I was called 
  to guard the gate, I had been assigned to deliver a report to them. If you 
  indeed wish to be friend to the kin, take this report to the Wakening. Eysa 
  Florawhisper. She will give you a token indicating that she has received the 
  message, return this to me and we may see a reward. <br>
  <br>
  (Wakening lands, a ways north of -1657.65, -1547.41, -28.82 (north of the 
  Faerie Dragon Cave)) <br>
  <br>
  Eysa Florawhisper says 'Ahh, why thank you, friend! We are greatful. I believe 
  if we work together, those children of Zek can be driven back in time. 
  Otherwise, survival hangs in the balance, for both of us. Take this token back 
  to the sentry as a symbol of our acceptance. <br>
  <br>
  Your faction standing with TunareanCourt got better <br>
  <br>
  You gain experience!! <br>

  <br>
  Sentry Emil says 'Your service is appreciated, Aandaie . I cannot reward you 
  well at this point but you have come closer to the kin, the citizens of 
  Skyshrine. Continue to prove your loyalty and greater rewards you may see, 
  perhaps the greatest of all. . . in time. <br>
  <br>
  Your faction standing with ClawsofVeeshan got better <br>
  Your faction standing with Yelinak got better <br>
  Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse <br>
  <br>
  You gain experience!!</span></b></p>
