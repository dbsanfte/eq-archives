        <font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">
        <p>Greetings friends of the Coldain, </p>
        <p>I would like to apologize for any inconvenience caused yesterday with 
        Dain Frostreaver IV giving a not enough faction response when handing in 
        the 7th Coldain Prayers Shawl. It was intended that anyone that could 
        get to this point in the shawl series could hand the Dain the shawl with 
        no worry. Unfortunately there was an issue with factions with the patch 
        yesterday. The Dain was perma-killed to protect people from losing their 
        shawls until last night’s patch. He is now working as intended, and 
        should be a lot more friendly to anyone trying to assist in his cause.
        </p>
        <p>Additionally I wanted to give a warning. When you give Loremaster 
        Borannin your shawl he gives you back the same shawl and tells you to 
        talk to the Dain. When you give your shawl to Chamberlain Krystorf or 
        the Dain (if he happens to be up) they will return a NEW shawl. This is 
        an exact copy of the 7th shawl, but will prevent multiple spawnings of 
        the Dain. Please do not go back and give this shawl to Loremaster 
        Borannin, he will not return it. </p>
        <p>- Frizznik</p>

        Castersrealm</a> has released their transcript of the Tradeskill forum 
        at the Seattle Fan Faire.&nbsp; Below is what the developers had to say!<p>&nbsp;- 
        Spiritual</p>
        <hr>
        <p>I’m Dan Enright, Yakatizma, game designer for EverQuest.&nbsp; We’ll go 
        around the room and take questions, comments, feedback, etc.</p>
        <p>There’s a lot of new recipes going in on the next patch.&nbsp; 
        Predominantly for pottery but a little bit of everything is going in.</p>
        <p><b>Will Fletching be expanded?</b></p>
        <p>It’s one of the better skills in terms of raising skills.&nbsp; We did add 
        the Acrylia arrows, and I know the Acrylia drops need to be 
        significantly increased.&nbsp; I’m unsure on exactly how much more we’ll add 
        to this in the immediate future.</p>
        <p><b>What plans are there to make Blacksmithing more appealing?</b></p>
        <p>We are looking to bring a lot of the trivials down, particularly on 
        Cultural Armor, so that these can be more of a level 20 – 30 item.&nbsp; This 
        would have been insane once upon a time, but with the amount of item 
        trickle that is occurring on servers these days it really isn’t a 
        problem to do this now. </p>
        <p>So we’ll be looking at doing a lot of trivial level revisions on a 
        few of the tradeskills in the near future.&nbsp; Blacksmithing and Tinkering 
        will be the first two of these we do.</p>
        <p><b>Any words on fixing Cazic-Thule tradeskill items?</b></p>
        <p>The no-drop stuff is something I am kind of against.&nbsp; It was the 
        first attempt of some of the new team members working on tradeskills.&nbsp; 
        There’s definitely some stuff there I will go back and work on to try 
        and help inter-dependency a bit.</p>
        <p><i><span style="COLOR: black">Note: &nbsp;Since Fan Faire the items drops 
        were increased and the components made No Drop during the last patch.</span></i></p>
        <p><b>Can we get poison stacking put in?</b></p>
        <p>We still can’t get it in.&nbsp; The closest we could do is put in a bottle 
        with charges of summon vial of poison.&nbsp; We are really looking to have 
        some work done on poison before planes of power.&nbsp; Looking at adding 
        things like bane poisons and stuff like that.</p>
        <p>We’re also looking into some of the other things like being able to 
        poison weapons for other people, being able to zone and keep your poison 
        on your weapon, etc.&nbsp; We are keeping a close eye on suggestions for this 
        skill.</p>
        <p><b>Why is Jewelry the only tradeskill which makes a lot of money?</b></p>
        <p>I think because originally we had a rule not to put in any dropped 
        jewelry which was better than player made.&nbsp; But that’s not really the 
        case any more.&nbsp; So we are working on revising a lot of the other 
        tradeskills to make sure the trivial levels are set in a way which we 
        can introduce more high level items to different tradeskills.&nbsp; We just 
        have to find a good way to do that.&nbsp; </p>
        <p><b>Will we see some of the imbalances between vendor buy back prices 
        and player buy back prices on items?</b></p>
        <p>To an extent.&nbsp; Some of these are set to encourage player trading over 
        selling off to vendors.&nbsp; But we will be working to try and balance this 
        a little bit better.</p>
        <p><b>Why don’t you bring in some kind of item deterioration to make 
        trades more demanded?</b></p>
        <p>At this point in EverQuest that just wouldn’t be good for the game.&nbsp; 
        As much as it might be better for the economy, the game has just been 
        out to long to do such a radical change to the game system.</p>
        <p><b>Which stat is used for raising skills in Blacksmithing?</b></p>
        <p>Whichever is the highest of Intelligence, Wisdom or Strength.</p>
        <p><b>What other skills have secondary skills like Smithing?</b></p>
        <p>Fletching runs off Dexterity, Jewelry runs off Dexterity, Tailoring 
        will run off Dexterity soon.&nbsp; Basically that means whichever is highest 
        of Intelligence, Wisdom or Dexterity will be the stat checked for 
        chances to raise skill.</p>
        <p><b>Will enchanters see more of the Clarify Mana type spells?</b></p>
        <p>Yes we’ll probably use them more over time.&nbsp; We already use them a 
        fair bit in Tailoring and Pottery.&nbsp; We might use them in Brewing even 
        one day for a super brew or something.</p>
        <p><b>Can we ever see more than one tradeskill go above 200?</b></p>
        <p>When we first put that in it was to encourage specialist traders to 
        work together to achieve certain items.&nbsp; Inter-dependency just has never 
        worked in EverQuest, people end up just wanting to max out the skills 
        themselves most of the time.&nbsp; But now that more coders on the team are 
        working on the tradeskill stuff we might review this.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>There are also some tradeskill increasing items to help raise non 
        specialist skills above 200 right now to help alleviate it a bit.</p>
        <p>We have been talking about several ideas to address this stuff.&nbsp; One 
        of which is raising the existing skill caps above 255 through recoding.&nbsp; 
        Another idea is to add a completely new skill you have to raise from 
        scratch that would make far superior products that you could only open 
        up after reaching 200 in a skill.</p>
        <p><b>Will we see the completion of the shawl quests?</b></p>
        <p>The designer who made this no long works with Sony.&nbsp; But it is a high 
        priority item that will be addressed once we go back and look at 
        Velious.&nbsp; Right now we are focusing on fixing up the newbie cities.&nbsp; But 
        it will be looked at.</p>
        <p>Probably won’t get done until sometime after Planes of Power.</p>
        <p><i><span style="COLOR: black">Note: Since Fan Faire, because of the 
        demand for the Shawl quests one of the designers, Paul Carrico, worked 
        hard over the past two weeks to get the 8<sup>th</sup> shawl quest 
        completed for this Wednesdays patch (May 8<sup>th</sup>).</span></i></p>
        <p><b>Can Alchemy be made a bit better?</b></p>
        <p>We are looking into Alchemy a bit.&nbsp; There’s a lot of stuff involved 
        with it we have to be careful of with infringing on other classes.&nbsp; But 
        we are aware of some of the issues with it.</p>
        <p>The Luclin potions which went in are really really nice, but they are 
        also pretty difficult.&nbsp; It alleviated some of the concerns a little bit 
        but not nearly enough.&nbsp; We might look at adjusting the durations and the 
        negative effects on some of the buffs.&nbsp; </p>
        <p><b>Why are some of the Luclin potions so hard to make?</b></p>
        <p>There were some, like the clarity one, which could only be put into 
        the game on the proviso that you needed the AAXP Alchemy in order to 
        make them fairly regularly.</p>
        <p><b>Why do some of the tradeskills have such large trivial gaps for 
        raising skills?</b></p>
        <p>We are looking into this.&nbsp; Jewelry and Fletching are pretty good for 
        this, but Tailoring and Tinkering are still pretty bad.&nbsp; We’ll be 
        addressing this in the near future.</p>
        <p><b>Will we ever see Acrylia or new Gems added to jewelcraft?&nbsp; Any 
        further use of enchanted gems planned?</b></p>
        <p>Originally there weren’t any plans for it.&nbsp; There are some ideas for 
        it which have been tossed around but I don’t foresee a close ETA for it 
        just because a lot of other tradeskills need more attention than 
        jewelcraft.</p>
        <p>But we are certainly at looking at using some of the imbued gems and 
        enchanted gems in more things than just jewelcraft.&nbsp; Pottery in 
        particular could be using some of these more in the near future.</p>
        <p><b>Is elemental damage actually working?</b></p>
        <p>There are some problems with it.&nbsp; We are continuing to look at it and 
        work out kinks.</p>
        <p><b>Will Planes of Power have much for tradeskills?</b></p>
        <p>Yes.&nbsp; Planes of Power will have <u>a lot</u> for tradeskills.&nbsp; I 
        can’t say much more than that at the moment.</p>
        <p>It will apply to players of all levels.&nbsp; Some of the new stuff will 
        be planar tradeskills which may even be required in order to complete 
        some of the planes.</p>
        <p><b>Can we get the ability to add more colors to Banded like we have 
        with Fine Steel?</b></p>
        <p>The way our tinting system works it just requires a lot of time to 
        do.&nbsp; It took us 2 months working 40+ hours a week to get the fine steel 
        stuff in.&nbsp; Until we get a better system or tools I can’t see it 
        happening.</p>
        <p><b>Can we see the Gnome Shadow Knights and Paladins get the ability 
        to use the Clock Work Tinkered armor?</b></p>
        <p>Yes.&nbsp; They should be able to, I’ll check into getting that added.</p>
        <p><b>Do you foresee Tradeskills being added which will appeal to the 
        high end player?</b></p>
        <p>Well it’s a unique situation in EverQuest.&nbsp; I’d personally love to 
        see tradeskill and quest items be the best, with drop items being the 
        lowest.&nbsp; On top of that I’d add in degradation so there was a constant 
        demand for the tradesman.&nbsp; Which is why baking is one of my favorite 
        EverQuest tradeskill.&nbsp; The only way I’d improve that is to reduce the 
        availability of food on vendors, which players would hate.&nbsp; But you can 
        get foods which last 100 times longer than some vendor bought foods.</p>
        <p>We are looking at ways to make high end tradeskill products more 
        appealing.</p>
        <p><b>Do certain races and classes consume food at different rates?</b></p>
        <p>There are some.&nbsp; Trolls and Ogres<b><span style="COLOR: #3366ff">
        </span></b>eat food and drink faster, monks do it slower.&nbsp; Some races 
        are different too. </p>
        <p><b>Can we see ores made stackable?</b></p>
        <p>I have no problem with that.&nbsp; We really need more storage space on 
        characters.&nbsp; The problem is that the programming changes needed to be 
        done are really scary.&nbsp;&nbsp; We may just look at a way to expand the bank 
        space, but even that would require a lot of reworking.</p>
        <p>It’s definitely a high desirable on the development team, it’s 
        brought up countless times each week.</p>
        <p><b>How was the Vendor system going to work?</b></p>
        <p>Basically you leave your character online and standing there but you 
        would go into an NPC mode where people can click on you and the trades

        <p><b>Will we ever have a way to reset tradeskill specialization?</b></p>
        <p>I don’t think so.&nbsp; It’s not really a good thing to do considering the 
        costs of raising some of the skills.&nbsp; We’d rather look more into the 
        advanced tradeskills route and then allowing more (or all) of the 
        existing tradeskills going up to 255.</p>
        <p>The strongest argument for it is due to people who accidentally get 
        the wrong specialization.&nbsp; We’ll look into it.</p>
        <p><b>Will gnomes ever get the tinkered Blunderbuss?</b></p>
        <p>Every expansion I have asked if it is yet time for the Gnomish 
        Blunderbuss.&nbsp; Maybe Planes of Power will be the time.&nbsp; We’ll see.</p>
        <p><b>Will we see more combined tradeskill items?</b></p>
        <p>Yes.&nbsp; I like the idea of this sort of thing.. One of my favorite 
        ideas right now is to use pottery and jewelry together to make focus 
        items.&nbsp; </p>

                <td><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">For as long as I’ve 
                been involved with EverQuest, as a player and as an employee, 
                petitions have been a popular practice. Someone will write out a 
                list of ideas that they think should be implemented. They’ll 
                post those ideas to a message board, usually one that caters to 
                members of a certain class. Usually these ideas will be 
                discussed and refined. Eventually someone starts a new thread 
                and asks people to post to the thread in order to ‘sign’ the 
                petition. Then someone (or everyone) sends a copy to us.
                <p>This is a natural thing for a community to do. And often this 
                is a very good way to generate conversation and can result in 
                some good ideas. </p>
                <p>However… </p>
                <p>For us as a team there are several problems with ‘petitions’. 
                Unfortunately these problems make it so that petitions often end 
                up being harmful to the production of useful ideas and they 
                hamper good communication between the players and the company. A 
                good idea is a good idea. Having four hundred people send in a 
                good idea doesn’t make that idea a better idea. Yes, we’ve 
                missed a few good ideas in the past, but there are better 
                methods for getting those ideas across. We think that the Dev 
                Corner is one of those methods. </p>
                <p>We’d much rather have one person send in a good idea than a 
                thousand people send in a list of ideas. The single idea is 
                easier to recognize, easier to discuss, easier to reply to. It’s 
                going to be clearer and far less cluttered. A laundry list of 
                ideas is very hard to respond to. A petition that has a dozen 
                suggestions basically requires a reasoned argument in response 
                to each of those suggestions, even if some of the suggestions 
                are obviously bad. The problem here is two-fold. First, we have 
                to spend the time replying to the whole petition rather than 
                just the good ideas. So just about any reply to a petition is 
                going to sound negative, and this makes it generally a bad idea 
                to reply to them. It makes us look mean, when we’re really a 
                bunch of teddy bears. </p>
                <p>Also, by their very nature these petitions are extremely 
                long. It’s not uncommon to see a petition with a few thousand 
                words or more. A very time-consuming thing to read. I know, I’ve 
                read every petition written about EverQuest over the last 16 
                months or so. Petitions end up being bloated because of their 
                create-by-committee nature. </p>
                <p>It’s also hard to believe that a petition accurately 
                represents the desires of a community. It’s probably fair to say 
                that for most of these petitions any given member of the 
                community will agree with some part of it and not other parts. 
                But because they can only agree or disagree with the entire 
                petition they will often sign it as a nod in agreement to the 
                parts that they like. By it’s very nature, a petition can’t 
                represent the individuals of a community very well. </p>
                <p>And then there’s the “well they did it, so should we” 
                problem. The moment we reply to one petition it gives people the 
                impression that they need to use petitions to get an idea 
                across. The truth is that ideas get across much more readily by 
                just about any other method. And despite the fact that we 
                respond to far more individual ideas than to petitions, any 
                response to a petition seems to strengthen the perception that 
                an idea has to flood into our email boxes in order for us to see 
                it. </p>
                <p>So here’s the problem. The discussions that take place during 
                the creation of a petition are great. Some very interesting 
                ideas come from those discussions, and we really don’t want to 
                discourage them. But I do want to discourage the use of 
                petitions as a tool for sending us ideas (for the reasons given 
                in wordy form above). </p>
                <p>All this leads to one comment, and one question. </p>
                <p>Comment: Please, if you have an idea about EverQuest that you 
                think will make the game better, send it to us through the Dev 
                Corner. </p>
                <p>Question: How can the community foster the discussion that 
                produces good ideas without also creating the petitions that 
                seem to be the natural conclusion from those discussions? </p>

                    There have been some questions about spell damage and spell 
                    healing not taking effect properly, things like a player 
                    seeing:<ol type="a">
                      <li type="a">multiple death messages </li>
                      <li>'you died' when they should have died to an NPC </li>
                      <li>seeing healing messages and then dying from damage 
                      that would appear to be less than the amount just healed.
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>It's a bug in the spell filters -- The workaround for 
                    this is to turn spell filtering totally off. </p>
                    <p>We're sorry we didn't patch code with the last patch, but 
                    we're in the process of updating some of the server 
                    architecture, which includes character storage, so we're 
                    taking our time on it. We need to make sure everything is 
                    working properly before we can patch this stuff, which 
                    includes the fix for this particular bug. </p>

                    <p>The one receiving the spell needs to have his or her 
                    filters turned off. </p>
                    <p>The tricky part is that when you look at the options for 
                    spell filters, the options are asking you if you want the <i>
                    spell messages</i> on or off. You want the filters off, 
                    which means that you want the spell messages on. </p>
                    <p>So when you get to the chat filters section of the 
                    options menu, <b>turn all of those spell messages ON.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>As for /serverfilter, if all the messages are on (filters 
                    off) then the condition of the /serverfilter won’t matter.

        <p>This appeared in a patch message in January. </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Added &quot;Recommended Level&quot; equal to the current item use level for 
          the several items. All of these items require the player to be level 
          51+ to equip them and/or use their effects. </p>
          <p>Setting the &quot;Recommended Level&quot; field like this just lets the 
          player know what level they need to be to use the item. The actual 
          utility of the item was not affected in any way, this change is purely 
          informational.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This has caused some confusion. Rich Waters wrote something 
        concerning this, and I want to quote part of it here. </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>This quote is being misrepresented as to it's meaning. I'll break 
          the change listed in the patch message down more clearly for you:</p>
          <p>Added a Recommended Level equal to <b>the current item use level</b> 
          for several items. </p>
          <p>All of the items being referred to as changed this patch <b>already 
          required the player to be level 51+</b> to even equip them or use 
          their effects. </p>
          <p>Adding the Recommended level to these items did not change their 
          utility in any way, as the Recommended Level placed on these items was 
          identical to the level at which they could be equipped. The 
          Recommended Level was added to the items referred to in that patch to 
          show the pre-existing level requirement on the item itself. </p>
          <p>A good example of an item changed for that patch in January is the 
          &quot;Di'zok Escape Staff &quot;. This item has always had a level limitation of 
          56 on it. If you were lower than level 56, you were unable to equip 
          the item, or click it to use its effect. In the January patch, I added 
          a Recommended Level of 56 to the item so that someone could look at it 
          and know that it could be used when they got to level 56. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This had me confused as well (not that it’s hard to confuse me), so I 
        can see how this could have been misunderstood. Basically, the items we 
        gave a Recommended Level to with that patch were items that already had 
        hard level restrictions. We added the Recommended Level to help make 
        those restrictions more obvious. No functionality was changed for those 
        items. </p>
        <p>Now, on to the heart of the matter. </p>
        <p>The Recommended Level of an item indicates at what level the item 
        will be most effective. The greater the difference between the 
        Recommended Level of an item and the level of the character using it, 
        the less effective that character will be with the item. The effect can 
        be very noticeable if the level difference is large. </p>
        <p>This allows us a lot more freedom when dealing with items that would 
        have received the No-Drop tag previously. There are, basically, two 
        reasons to use the No-Drop tag on an item (though I’m sure there are 
        plenty of other reasons). One would be instances where we want the item 
        to be obtained by the character in person rather than by purchase from 
        another character. These can be seen most often with quest items and 
        things like planar gear. Those cases would probably still receive a 
        No-Drop tag. </p>
        <p>But cases where the item might be tagged No-Drop to prevent twinking 
        the item, that item can now be given scalability by setting a 
        recommended level. This would allow you to pass items down to characters 
        and those items will grow as they grow. It also means that if you manage 
        to play above your level and defeat some fearsome foe to gain a Sword of 
        Dragon Slaying, your character can wield that weapon and it will grow as 
        he levels. </p>
        <p>Recommended Level allows our designers to be a lot more flexible with 
        item creation, an excellent alternative to just making an item No-Drop 
        or a hard level limit (like the Club of the Ice Ocean, where a character 
        can’t equip the item unless he is of a certain level). </p>
        <p>I also wanted to address the rumors about changes to certain items on 
        Test. </p>
        <p>No, we haven’t changed the Fungi Tunic on Test. However, it is 
        possible that we will do so in the future. We have been following the 
        discussion about this item across the fan sites and from emails sent in 
        to us directly. The Tunic is a pretty good example of the kind of item 
        that has a dramatic affect on the game when it is used by lower level 
        characters. We understand that some people see that as a good thing, 
        while others see it as a bad thing. </p>
        <p>We haven’t made any decisions about applying the Recommended Level to 
        items like the tunic. But I wanted to let you know that such a change is 
        not impossible, for the tunic or other items with similar affect when 
        twinked. </p>

        <b>News from the Vale</b></p>
        <p>Clan Death Fist has long had a minor presence in the Misty Thicket, 
        preying on the Halfling farmers and tradesmen. Recently the Death Fist 
        Clans numbers in the thicket have increased and the Orcs are cutting 
        down trees and mining the rock of the nearby mountains. Reports have 
        come in to Rivervale that the Orcs are shipping the lumber and ore to 
        the commonlands and stockpiling it for an unknown purpose. Whatever the 
        Deathfists agenda, their increased presence has made the thicket a more 
        dangerous place beyond the protective wall. </p>
        <p>Not far from the tunnel that leads from the Misty Thicket to 
        Rivervale lie mysterious cursed ruins. All that remains of what once 
        stood at these sites are fragments of walls that are presumed to have 
        been constructed around the same time as the nearby ruined tower. An 
        ancient magical scarecrow stands at the center of one of these ruins and 
        warns passers by that the place is cursed. It is a popular belief among 
        the halflings of Rivervale that the crumbled walls once surrounded 
        beautiful and fruitful gardens that were cursed when their owner and 
        caretaker offended the Gods. Whether or not this story is true, the 
        scarecrows warning is true as the gardens are host to diseased vermin 
        and the animated corpses of fallen halflings who were brought to the 
        there and buried after their death by an unknown evil. </p>
        <p>With the Goblin Clan Pickclaws now occupying a portion of Runnyeye 
        Citadel the number of Goblins now residing in the Misty Thicket has 
        grown. These somewhat exiled Runnyeye Goblins have been mining Crude 
        Iron Ore from the nearby mountains and are most likely attempting to 
        forge weapons and armor to use in a goblin revolt to reclaim all of 
        Runnyeye Citadel from the Pickclaws. With enemies to all sides these 
        semi-exiled goblins are being far less troublesome than they have the 
        potential to be.</font></td>

        <p><font face="Arial">We'd like to take a moment and talk about two of 
        the features that we wanted to include with The Shadows of Luclin. The 
        new User Interface for EverQuest and the player merchant features for 
        the Bazaar.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">It's been asked about in Feedback, in game, on the 
        message boards, at
        <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/index.jsp">Fan 
        Faires</a>, and it's only fair that we offer an update.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="-1">
        <span class="header">What happened?</span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">It's been said that no battle plan ever survives 
        contact with the enemy. Over Luclin's development our biggest enemy was 
        time and the battle was fought over many days, even more late nights, 
        and the occasional bad analogy.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Toward the end of Luclin's beta testing, we 
        re-evaluated the list of features that we were planning on having 
        finished. Unfortunately, the Interface wasn't in a state to where it 
        could have realistically been one of them. It just needed too much work 
        to be able to do half the cool things that we wanted it to. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">After the expansion was live and the frantic pace 
        slowed down a little, we took a deeper look at what, exactly, it was 
        that we had on our hands. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">To be brutally honest, we didn't much like what we 
        saw.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">We decided that it would be best to start over and 
        write a more powerful system, which would allow us to do more than we 
        had originally planned. What we really didn't want to do was advertise a 
        fantastic new feature, then deliver something that fell short of 
        people's expectations. We'd rather take the time and do it right.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">We think it will be worth the wait. We're being a 
        little cautious when talking about specific features for the interface 
        at this point. While we'd love to release details of all the features it 
        might contain, we don't want to leave anyone disappointed if a feature 
        doesn't make it into the release. (We honestly do try to learn from our 
        mistakes.)</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial"><br>
        <span class="header">When should we expect it?</span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">EverQuest's interface consists of over 5,000 
        interface elements spanning 140 screens, tools, and windows. Some may 
        not know this, but GMs and Guides have their own administrative screens 
        in the EverQuest game client. In addition, Designers, Artists, and 
        Animators have some of their tools built right in as well. All of these 
        need to be recreated in the new interface.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Writing a new, solid system and integrating it 
        with that many moving parts is a large and complicated job. It's 
        compounded by the fact that while doing this, we need to make sure that 
        we don't break either of the two existing interfaces. It's definitely an 
        interesting balancing act.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Suffice it to say we have a number of developers 
        and at least one artist working on this and nothing else. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><br>
        One of the more common rumors is that we're holding it back to include 
        it as a feature exclusive to Planes of Power -- That's not going to be 
        the case. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Once it's nearing completion and is good enough to 
        use for the majority of gameplay, we hope to begin rolling it out to the 
        test server. Barring any unforeseen complications, that stage will begin 
        sometime in the next few months. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">When it's complete, the new interface will be 
        released to all players as a standard part of the EverQuest game client.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial"><br>
        <span class="header">What about the Bazaar?</span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The story of the Bazaar follows closely with that 
        of the new interface. As our production cycle neared its end, we 
        realized that we would not have time to complete the features properly 
        before the release of Shadows of Luclin. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Because this is a complicated new trade system, 
        rushing this project could create item and cash bugs (both duplication 
        and loss). So, as with the interface, we decided that it was best to do 
        it the right way.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The Bazaar will include several new windows and 
        other such things, so creating the complete Bazaar has to wait until the 
        new interface system is ready. Completing the Bazaar first would mean 
        developing a number of windows for the old interface and then repeating 
        the work for the new one.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">We hope to have the Bazaar available on Test 
        shortly after the new interface is live.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><br>
        We're definitely sorry to keep you waiting for this. We're hoping that 
        by the time it's finished, you'll agree that it was worth the wait.</font></p>

              have a lot of people testing it out. You will be able to access

              see how it holds up under a full server load, and for that we need 
              players logged in and playing. Now is also a good time to try it 
              out and see if Kane Bayle will provide you EverQuest with a better

        I don't know anything about these folks, but thought you all might enjoy 
        knowing about it :)<p>Announcing the Twilight Exchange! <br>
        <br>
        For those who have been working on the Twilight Sea quests, with the
        5 zones and hundreds of rare quest mobs &amp; drops, I have started an
        ezboard dedicated to being a pan-server marketplace and discussion
        area for the quests. The idea is that most people will end up with
        more unneeded drops than needed, so the board is there to make it easy
        to arrange trades with people that have what you need and need what
        you have. <br>
        <br>
        There is a board for each server, plus areas for discussing the
        quests. Of course, it will only work if people use it, so I'm trying
        to get the word out to as many Everquest sites as possible. Please,
        if you are working on the quests and want to make trades of drops,
        come to The Twilight Exchange and post what you've got, and what you
        want! <br>

            <font face="Verdana" size="2">(11/27/2001 Denver, 
            Colorado) – Today, GuildPortal, an online community host for players 
            of Massively Multiplayer Online Games, announced the nearing of 300 
            hosted guilds and player associations supporting over 2200 users.</font></div>

            <font face="Verdana" size="2">“This shows the 
            viability of the underlying GuildPortal engine,” said Aaron Lewis, 
            developer of the GuildPortal service.&nbsp; “The performance has stayed 
            consistent througout the increase in the number of users 
            concurrently accessing the site, keeping each guild’s portal at 
            least as fast as most single-guild hosted solutions.” </font>

          <div>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2">The service offers 
            forums, voting, events scheduling/notification, member rosters, news 
            feeds specific to the game a guild plays, chat and an integrated 
            e-mail service.&nbsp; Boasting over 30 different ways to customize the 
            appearance of a guild’s page, GuildPortal claims to be at the top of 
            their game – and yours.&nbsp; “It’s not just fluff, either.&nbsp; If you go 
            check out the options for customization on forum solutions, you’ll 
            see that most if it is filler.&nbsp; It exists solely for the purpose of 
            having something to list in the bi-weekly release notes.&nbsp; 
            GuildPortal really offers you a full solution,” said Lewis.</font></div>

            <font face="Verdana" size="2">What’s on the horizon?&nbsp; 
            “Right now, GuildPortal is working on putting together a package of 
            Web Services based on the .NET platform.&nbsp; Once that’s done, we hope 
            to be able to work out arrangements with game publishers so that 
            their systems can talk to ours in near real-time.&nbsp; For example, if 
            you create a guild in, say, EverQuest, our web services could accept 
            information from Verant’s servers, automatically creating your 
            guild’s web presence for you.&nbsp; Now, we haven’t spoken to any game 
            publishers yet about this, as we want to get a working framework in 
            place before we do.&nbsp; But it’s something we’re really very excited 
            about.”</font></div>

        <font face="Verdana" size="2">Several people also asked for a 
        way to donate towards the cost of operating this website.&nbsp; I gave 
        this some serious thought, and realized that if people wanted to help 
        with the costs, I would be foolish to not let them! &lt;grin&gt;.&nbsp; Some 
        things I want to say first.&nbsp; I will never make 
        this site a pay only site (or even a partially pay site).&nbsp; I will 
        never have popup ads.&nbsp; I will always have this site where anyone 
        that wants, can come and find the information they are looking for, 
        without a price.&nbsp; But I am 
        willing to take donations to its operation.&nbsp; Please don't ever feel 
        obligated to donate, this is purely for those that have asked, or wanted 
        too.&nbsp; You can donate as low as one dollar. Right now I can accept
        <a href="http://www.paypal.com/">Paypal</a> donations.&nbsp; If people 
        wants something other than Paypal, let me know.&nbsp; You can go to the
        <a href="support.htm">Support EQDruids</a> 
        page for the Paypal donation button.</font></p>
        
     
   
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I've also added a nice guide from Pelf to our reference section.&nbsp;

        &quot;Sharpening 
        the Sword&quot;</a> guide for some great info on what to do the level before 
        you ding, the level you ding, and level after you ding.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Beyond that, the majority of the structure of the site is done for now.&nbsp; 
        Between now and the release of Luclin, I'll be doing minor updates, and 
        cleanup.&nbsp; I'll also be making the site look a little prettier :)</font></p>

        First I need to thank Zonaxx for pointing out eqcasters.&nbsp; This is 
        an excellent spell for viewing the spell database from Everquest.&nbsp; 
        Thanks to his showing me this program, there has been a MAJOR update to 
        the <a href="../spells/main_spells.htm">spell areas</a>.&nbsp; Take a look!&nbsp; 
        I will be updating the printer friendly pages later tonight, or 
        tomorrow.&nbsp; Those haven't been updated yet.</font><p>
        <font face="Verdana" size="2">
        I've also added a
        <a href="downloads.htm">download</a> section.&nbsp; So far there 
        are two downloads.&nbsp; All the 
        <a href="../downloads/druid_spell.zip">
        druid spells</a>, in an Excel spreadsheet, and also in a Word document.&nbsp; 
        And a copy of <a href="../downloads/EqCaster.zip">
        eqcasters</a>, the spell 
        database viewing program.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Other than those items, there was some spelling and grammar fixes 
        thanks to a sharp eyed reader (Pelf is the man!), and a
        <a href="thanks.htm">Thanks</a> page put in by myself.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Things are progressing.&nbsp; Slowly but surely.&nbsp; I have about a 
        week and a half before Shadows of Luclin causes us all to go nuts, so 
        I'll keep plugging here!</font></td>
