  <b><font face="Arial">There is some question on when you can start the epic.&nbsp; 
  It seems that you possibly can start it pre-51, and possibly do the last turn 
  in before 51.&nbsp; I have not personally verified this, so do so at your own 
  risk.</font></b></p><p><b><font face=Arial>You can however do a lot of the epic pre-51.&nbsp; You can forage the different items and also can probably kill some of the different creatures needed.</font></b></p><p>

  <b><font face=Arial>The Druid Epic starts with talking to Telin Darkforest in Burning Woods. He's hidden in a grove of thick trees near to the Skyfire zone usually around 3200, 2900. He’s very easy to find on tracking if you zone into Burning Woods from Skyfire. Start up your tracking and you should be able to find him easily.<br> <br> Ask him &quot;what action&quot; and he will give you a note. If he won’t respond to you, you need to do the Muffin Quest (see Epic Faction Fix guide).</font></b></p><p align=center>
  <b><font face=Arial>
  <img border=0 src=../epic/images/wornnote.jpg width="380" height="151"></font></b></p><p><b><font face=Arial><br> <br> Now that you have the note, you need to give the note to Faelin Bloodbriar in Greater Faydark. She spawns around 1500, 500 near Orc Hill and the entrance to Crushbone. She has Orc Pawn placeholder that is standing between two trees (add loc). Make sure that you continue to SoW yourself. When she does spawn, she immediately SoWs herself and takes off running! When you see her on tracking take out the note and start running to her. She runs in a circular pattern and will not stop if hailed. Run up behind her and give her the note. Once you have given her the note you will receive a ring and she will despawn.</font></b></p><p align=center>
  <b><font face=Arial>
  <img border=0 src=../epic/images/ring.jpg width="317" height="133"></font></b></p><p><b><font face=Arial><br> <br> Your next step is to go to the Kithicor Forest. Once there, head towards the entrance to High Hold Pass. Start your tracking and find Giz X’Tin. He is a dark elf, but will not attack you. Hand him the ring you received from Faelin and he gives you a dark metal coin.</font></b></p><p align=center>
  <b><font face=Arial>
  <img border=0 src=../epic/images/dmcoin.jpg width="318" height="131"></font></b></p><p align=center>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <b><font face=Arial>Handing him the ring will spawn a level fifty Dark Elf Reaver but with SoW or wolf form you will be able to run away without a problem. Killing the Reaver is not recommended. You will be hit with negative faction, and may not be able to redo this portion of the quest if necessary.</font></b></p><p>
  <b><font face=Arial><br> Now return to Telin Darkforest and give him the dark metal coin. He will give it back to you as worn metal coin and tells you to find Athele.</font></b></p><p align=center>
  <b><font face=Arial>
  <img border=0 src=../epic/images/worncoin.jpg width="316" height="132"></font></b></p><p><b><font face=Arial><br> <br> <a name="Now is when you will need to bring a few friends along">Now is when you will need to bring a few friends along</a>. You are about to do several trades in a row which will cause a spawn of three Reavers. You should not need a huge group of people, only enough to keep three NPCs busy (they are all about level fifty). Park your friends up the hill from the Barbarian Farm, about neg 1500, neg 1000.&nbsp; You need to make sure to do all the trades in order.&nbsp; If you do not complete all the trades you will have to start over.<br> <br> Go to Athele. Athele is in East Karana north of the barbarian fishing village. Give her the worn metal coin and receive a Braided Grass Amulet.</font></b></p><p align=center>
  <b><font face=Arial>
  <img border=0 src=../epic/images/braided-grass.jpg width="329" height="138"></font></b></p><p align=center>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <b><font face=Arial>&nbsp;Now track Sionae. Give the Braided Grass Amulet to Sionae. From Sionae you will receive a Frayed Braided Grass Amulet.</font></b></p><p align=center>
  <b><font face=Arial>
  <img border=0 src=../epic/images/frayed-grass.jpg width="321" height="135"></font></b></p><p align=center>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <b><font face=Arial>Take the Frayed Braided Grass Amulet and give it to Nuien. You will receive the same amulet back. Finally hand that amulet to Teola. Teola will say to follow her, instead run/gate back to your party.</font></b></p><p>
  <b><font face=Arial>A Dark Elf Corruptor and two Dark Elf Reavers will spawn near your party. The Corrupter is your target. If he is not attacked within ten seconds of spawning he will despawn (and you start all over again). Easiest way to handle this, is for you to take care of the Corrupter and have your party take care of the two Dark Reavers.</font></b></p><p>
  <b><font face=Arial>The Reavers will try to kill all the druids/rangers that you were just dealing with. You do not want this to happen! If the NPCs are killed before you finish killing the Corrupter he will despawn. Kill the Corrupter, loot the Fleshbound Tome from his body, and then kill the Reavers. (suggestion here, an enchanter can make this VERY easy, as they can mez the two Reavers until the Corrupter is dead).</font></b></p><p align=center>
  <b><font face=Arial>
  <img border=0 src=../epic/images/fleshbound.jpg width="323" height="141"></font></b></p><p><b><font face=Arial><br> If the Reavers kill Athele wait one hour of real world time and Athele will spawn again. Give her the tome and she gives you an Earthstained Note.</font></b></p><p align=center>
  <b><font face=Arial>
  <img border=0 src=../epic/images/earthstained.jpg width="321" height="140"></font></b></p><p><b><font face=Arial>Bring this to Ella Foodcrafter, a Halfling running around in Misty Thicket. <br> <br> Like Faelin, she constantly runs, so you have to chase her. Give her the Earthstained Note and she will tell you that she needs a mixture. She will give you her mixing bowl. It is a container so make sure you have a free slot in your inventory. She also mentions some kind of ancient bowl that she needs. <br> &nbsp;</font></b></p><p>
  <b><font face=Arial>The mixing bowl she hands you is the Shiny Tin Bowl.</font></b></p><p align=center>
  <b><font face=Arial>

  <b><br> <font size=6><a name="The Hardened Mixture">The Hardened Mixture</a></font></b></font></p><p>
  <b><font face=Arial><br> You need to forage four items from different zones to combine in the mixing bowl. The items are:<br> <br> Chilled Tundra Root from Everfrost<br> Sweetened Mudroot from Misty Thicket<br> Speckled Moldy Mushrooms from Innothule Swamp<br> 
  Ripened Heartfruit from Greater Faydark<br> <br> You can forage these items at anytime. All you need is over one hundred in foraging (which is level twenty). [Edit] There has been a change to foraging that seems to allow you to forage these items at anytime.&nbsp; So you may not need one hundred in foraging any longer.</font></b></p><p>
  <b><font face=Arial>&nbsp;If you forage these items below fifty one keep them! It will save you time later.<br> <br> Once you have all four items, combine them in the mixing bowl and you will receive the Hardened Mixture. You can now dispose of the mixing bowl.</font></b></p><p align=center><font face=Arial>
  <b>

  <b><font face=Arial><br> Now you need to go to the Chessboard in Timorous Deep. If you are level 52 or higher take the barge from the Oasis docks, get off on the first island, and cast Egress. You will port to the Chessboard. If you don't have it egress the alternative is to levitate and SoW and run to the south. You should eventually be able to track Alrik Farsight. If not his loc is approximately -6500, 200. <br> <br> When you find Alrik, hail him then say &quot;How do you make an ancient bowl?&quot; and &quot;I can take the artifact.&quot; He will then give you a crushed pot and send you to Felwithe.</font></b></p><p align=center>
  <b><font face=Arial>
  <img border=0 src=../epic/images/crushedpot.jpg width="316" height="132"></font></b></p><p><b><font face=Arial>In Felwithe you need to find Farious Elianos. He is in Felwithe South at the merchant building near the caster’s guild (you can find him with tracking). <br> <br> 
  If your faction with him isn't at least Amiable you need to&nbsp; refer to the 
  Epic Faction Fixing page under the Keepers of the Art quest (batwing quest). 
  You can also gain positive faction by killing Kizdean Gix in West Commons 
  (dark elf near the inns).&nbsp; He probably will not respond to your hails, 
  but if your faction is amiable or better you can turn in the items.</font></b></p><p>
  <b><font face=Arial> <br> Once Farios cons amiable and will talk to you, give him the pot and in return you will receive a grocery list.</font></b></p><p align=center>
  <b><font face=Arial>
  <img border=0 src=../epic/images/grocerylist.jpg width="317" height="133"></font></b></p><p><b><font face=Arial>Take the grocery list to Merchant Nora in the Shop of All Halos in Felwithe north, near the cleric guild.

  <b><font face=Arial>
  <img border=0 src=../epic/images/bag.jpg width="317" height="130"></font></b></p><p><b><font face=Arial>Bring the

  <b><font face=Arial>
  <img border=0 src=../epic/images/receipt.jpg width="318" height="131"></font></b></p><p><b><font face=Arial><br> <br> Now return to Alrik Farsight in Timorous Deep. Give Alrik the receipt and he will give you an ancient pattern.</font></b></p><p align=center>
  <b><font face=Arial>
  <img border=0 src=../epic/images/ancientpattern.jpg width="380" height="151"></font></b></p><p><b><font face=Arial><br> The pattern instructs you to combine the pattern with a piece of enchanted clay and platinum speckled powder in a pottery wheel. Don’t worry if you don’t have any skills in pottery there is no skill check. <br> <br> To receive the platinum speckled powder you must first forage a Rose of Firiona in Firiona Vie and give it to Merdan Fleetwood in Surefall Glades. The rose is not no drop, so if a druid/ranger happens to have one of them, you could buy or be given it. When you give the rose to Merdan you will receive back an Old Wooden Painting.</font></b></p><p align=center>
  <b><font face=Arial><br> 
  <img border=0 src=../epic/images/woodpainting.jpg width="381" height="150"><br> &nbsp;</font></b></p><p><b><font face=Arial>Take the old wooden painting the human skeleton in Frontier Mountains. He will show on tracking a “A Human Skeleton”.

  <b><font face=Arial>
  <img border=0 src=../epic/images/sclocket.jpg width="381" height="150"></font></b></p><p><b><font face=Arial><br> Return to Surefall Glade and give the locket to Niera Farbreeze. When you give her the locket she will hand you the platinum speckled powder.</font></b></p><p align=center>

  <img border=0 src=../epic/images/platspec.jpg width="380" height="151"></font></b></p><p><b><font face=Arial><br> <br> Next you need to find the enchanted clay. Go to Kaladim and find Kinlo Strongarm in Kaladim's EverHot Forge. Once you find Kinlo ask him &quot;what mud&quot; and &quot;do it for me&quot; Kinlo will tell you that he would like to have a colored axe for his service. He wants a Jade Reaver that can be looted off the Black Reavers in the City of Mist. <br> <br> Be forewarned the Black Reavers are a serious mob to deal with. They are approximately level 50-52. One will spawn, and when you kill him either he will drop or another will spawn immediately in his place. This can happen up to seven times! Make sure to bring a nice solid party with you for this mob. Most of them are behind a locked door so you should bring a Rogue with lock picking along just in case. <br> <br> There is an upside here. The Jade Reaver can be purchased from other players. So if you are unable to put together a group for City of Mist you do have that alternative.</font></b></p><p>
  <b><font face=Arial><br> Hand Kinlo the Jade Reaver and you will be handed the enchanted clay in return. Now that you have the clay, combine the pattern, clay and powder in any pottery wheel to make the Rune Crested Bowl.</font></b></p><p align=center>

  <b><font face=Arial>
  <img border=0 src=../epic/images/softly.jpg width="381" height="151"></font></b></p><p><b><font face=Arial><br> <br> You can find Foloal on the wall that circles the city of Firiona Vie at the north end.

(luckily she means the spawn of Venril Sathir’s remains not the true Venril Sathir!)<br> <br> Venril Sathir is found in Karnor’s Castle, in the Dreadlands. Venril Sathir’s remains will spawn twenty four hours (approximately) after Venril Sathir is killed.</font></b></p><p>
  <b><font face=Arial>When the remains spawn, go into Karnor’s Castle and hail him. First he wants a Globe of Fireflies.&nbsp; 
  Use the spell Dance of Fireflies to make a Globe of Fireflies to turn in.&nbsp; This is a level 
  one spell for those that forgot they even had the spell.</font></b></p><p><b><font face=Arial>This spell can only be cast at night.&nbsp; You might want to go ahead and make yourself a globe ahead of time, so you aren't having to wait at the spawn for night to fall.</font></b></p><p>
  <b><font face=Arial>Hand him the globe and a new Venril Sathir will spawn. Give the new Venril Sathir the level 49 Cleric spell Resurrection (this spell is purchased at any of the Cleric guilds). When you hand the remains the spell he will now attack you. Kill the remains and loot one of the Pulsing Green Stones (he drops two). This is where you can make a druid/ranger friend. Rangers also need this stone for their epic. So you can normally have others help you knowing that two people will benefit.</font></b></p><p align=center>

  <b><font face=Arial><br> All three mobs start out as a tainted mob first. When you kill a tainted mob you have a chance for the corrupted mob to spawn. The corrupted will spawn right on top of the tainted corpse.<br> <br> The Tainted/Corrupted Mammoth. He is approximately level twenty and spawns in Everfrost Peaks. Mammoth Calves are his place holder. If he isn’t up kill

He double attacks for 250DMG and has 30k Hitpoints so it will take a bit to kill him.</font></b></p><p>
  <b><font face=Arial>He has also been known to run at 30 % health.</font></b></p><p>
  <b><font face=Arial>Kill him and loot Froglok Essence.</font></b></p><p align=center>

  The Corrupted Gorilla can be found in the Emerald Jungle. Place holders for 
  the Corrupted Gorilla are the Tottering Gorillas. Keep killing Tottering 
  Gorillas until the Corrupted spawns and then kill Corrupted. </font></b></p>
  <div>
    <b>There are 2 different tainted gorillas.</b></div>
  <div>
    <b>Only the live version will spawn the corrupted.</b></div>
  <p><b><font face=Arial>The Corrupted drops the Green Tree Bark.</font></b></p><p align=center>
  <b><font face=Arial>
  <img border=0 src=../epic/images/tree_bark.jpg width="381" height="151"></font></b></p><p><b><font face=Arial><br> The Corrupted Barracuda is found in the main lake of Lake of Ill Omen. You can normally find the barracuda spawns at neg950 neg900.</font></b></p><p>
  <b><font face=Arial>Kill the Deepwater Barracuda, until the Tainted spawns.</font></b></p><p>
  <b><font face=Arial>Be warned this mob can take a LONG time to spawn. An easy way to see if the tainted will spawn the corrupted is to pull the tainted barracudas onto the land. If they follow the Corrupted probably spawn after.</font></b></p><p>
  <b><font face=Arial>Be warned the barracudas are not an easy kill! You should probably have backup help for this mob. Once you kill the Corrupted Barracuda loot the Pure Lakewater.</font></b></p><p align=center>
  <b><font face=Arial>
  <img border=0 src=../epic/images/purelake.jpg width="381" height="152"></font></b></p><p><b><font face=Arial><br> The last mob is Faydedar. This is not an easy dragon. He however is spawn able.<br> <br> Take the boat from the Oasis dock to Timorous Deep. Egress/Succor to the Chessboard. Now is a great time to have a high level mage friend. If you have such, he can go to the Oasis where Faydedar spawns and Call of the Hero you all over. If you don’t have such you need to swim or levitate/run to neg 11300, neg 3500. This is a wall in the water. Swim down underwater and you will see an entrance to the Oasis.</font></b></p><p>
  <b><font face=Arial>Once inside you have to find the second entrance through the second ring. The second entrance is on the north side of the inside ring.<br> <br> For tactics on Faydedar look the links for Faydedar specific guides on the main Epic Page. They are very good and have a lot of information. I will put the basics here.<br> <br> As with many dragons Faydedar dispels. So load up everyone with “junk” buffs (resist poison, resist disease, see invisible etc. You will want resist fire, so don’t use that yet). Once everyone is buffed up then cast the beneficial buffs like Skin like Nature, and Resist Fire. You will want your Fire and Magic resists as high as possible! Bring some bards along they are great help here. <br> <br> Now remove your SoW and turn run off (Faydedar can also fear). The most important thing for people to realize here, and I can’t emphasize this enough. DO NOT SIT DOWN. EVER. If you sit while the fight is going on, you guarantee agro from Faydedar.<br> <br> To spawn Faydedar go to Dolgin Codslayer. Give him the Froglok Essence you looted from Ulump.</font></b></p><p>
  <b>
  <font face="Arial">Before you do the turn in, make sure you have people track 
  Faydedar (the non spawned version).&nbsp; In the rare cases that he is up as a 
  normal mob, the hand in will not spawn the &quot;spawned&quot; Faydedar.&nbsp; Either 
  one is useable for the epic however, so if the normal mob is up, you can kill 
  him for your piece also.</font></b></p><p><b><font face=Arial>Dolgin will give it back to you and then despawn. Be ready for Faydedar next. Don’t laugh at him (he’s tiny) but has all the power of a full size dragon!<br> <br> Once you have killed Faydedar loot the Pod of Seawater</font></b></p><p align=center>
  <b><font face=Arial>
  <img border=0 src=../epic/images/pod.jpg width="378" height="151">.</font></b></p><p><b><font face=Arial>Now travel to the Overthere. Hand the Froglok Essence, the Green Tree Bark, the Pure Lakewater and the Pod of Seawater to Nekexin Virulence in Overthere. When you hand him the four items he will despawn and you will have the Cleansed Spirit of Kunark.</font></b></p><p>
  <b><font face=Arial>He is by the water at the far north end of the zone, to the east of the evil outpost.<br> <br> Be very careful here. The guards of Overthere are nasty with a fairly large agro range. Easiest way to avoid them is to either come along the zone from the Frontier Mountains/Overthere zone and keep going along the east side of the zone. Or take the Bloated Belly (the evil boat to Overthere that leaves from Oasis docks) and as soon as it zones into the Overthere jump off and swim to shore tracking Nekexin.</font></b></p><p align=center><b><font size=6 face=Arial><a name="The End">The End</a></font></b></p><p>
  <b><font face=Arial>You’ve done it! You have finished all but one task to obtain your epic!
