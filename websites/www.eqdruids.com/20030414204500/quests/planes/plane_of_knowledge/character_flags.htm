  Thelin.&nbsp; His life on Norrath was a miserable one. As a young man he began to 
  study the workings of fear inspired by Cazic-Thule. The workings had been 
  translated for mortals by Zebuxoruk. Pouring over the texts, Thelin felt his 
  mind being invaded by Cazic. This information was not for mortal usage and the 
  malevolent god stripped him of all his earthly belongings and cursed him to 
  live in [poverty and ruin].'</font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Adroha Jezith says 'Aye, he lived in 
  the streets of Eastern Freeport, begging from those passing through the port. 
  He sat quivering, propped up against a wall with one hand out as he watched 
  the travelers pass by. None of them even gave him a second glance. Several 
  years would pass before a female dwarf would arrive to trade some of her 
  family's armor and weapons. She saw and took pity on Thelin. She knelt down, 
  scratched her beard then began to rummage through her backpack. She then 
  placed a [jeweled dagger] in his hand, smiled and returned to her former 
  business.'</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">You say, 'what jeweled dagger'</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Adroha Jezith says 'This was the only 
  gift that Thelin had received since the curse.&nbsp; It was beautifully crafted and 
  would likely have fetched a handsome price upon the market. He decided to keep 
  the dagger as it was such a kind gesture. Later that eve, Thelin heard the 
  calling of others that studied Zebuxoruk's workings. He recognized the 
  language they called out in. He approached the men and explained he had 
  studied the writings of Zebuxoruk.&nbsp; One of the shaded figures then began to 
  mutter an incantation. Suddenly, there was a bright flash, lush vegetation and 
  a peaceful breeze surrounded them. They had ascended here, to the [Plane of 
  Tranquility] where they could further study the works without interference 
  from the gods and mortals alike.'</font></p>

  here. He assisted the other followers by using all his mana to open a portal 
  to the Plane of Nightmares, the demi-plane ruled by the child of The Faceless, 
  Terris-Thule. Spent from using all his energies, he went to bed early after 
  his victory had been achieved in this task.&nbsp; As he laid in bed, he looked over 
  the dagger that had been given to him by the female dwarf. He smiled at the 
  new peace he had found here and began to fall asleep.&nbsp; Drifting away into the 
  realm of dreams, his subconscious was assulted by the horrors of a nightmare. 
  He tossed and turned from the visions that came before him. So bad did he 
  writhe in his subconscious torment that he turned on the dagger. He was 
  critically injured, and let out a wrenching scream. We found him and were able 
  to heal his wound enough to keep him alive. However, he still lies in a deep 
  coma seemingly [tortured by nightmares].'</font></p>

  that Terris-Thule is punishing him for allowing entrance into her plane. She 
  seems to have an exceedingly strong tie to him. Since her father has already 
  punished him, she likely found that he was easily tormented by her own powers. 
  Sometimes he talks while tossing and turning. We have taken note of everything 
  he has said. He has said 'I accept your offer Terris-Thule', 'I must find the 
  pieces', and 'It never ends'. You must help him.&nbsp; Go through the portal that 
  he has helped to create. Try to find his planar projection in Terris' plane. 
  Help him wake from this torment. Please, I beg you. I cannot stand to watch 
  him suffer any longer.'</span></p>
