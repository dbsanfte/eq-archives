  <b><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">This is one of 4 or 5 
  quests which results in a key for entry into the castle area of Acrylia 
  Caverns. It is designed for a group of about 10 Level 40 players. <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'Hail, Scout Danarin' <br>
  <br>
  Scout Danarin says 'Hello, welcome to the front lines of our war against the 
  bastard grimlings. As I'm sure you know, we Vah Shir shun violence, but with 
  this enemy there is no other way. Let me know if you'd like to see some 
  action. <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'I would like to see some action .' <br>
  <br>
  Scout Danarin smiles, 'I can escort you to a camp rich with enemies. With my 
  help you can take possession of their camp. They'll try desperately to reclaim 
  their lost territory and, if we're lucky, an officer will show up. You'll want 
  to bring about ten soldiers as powerful as me. When you're all here and ready 
  for battle, give me a marbled Acrylia sphere. <br>
  <br>
  The sphere can be bought at the merchant in one of the huts in the Val Shir 
  outpost. Handing him the sphere will have him respawn with weapons, and lead 
  you to the camp. He will pause briefly then tell you &quot;my next words mark the 
  start..&quot; <br>
  <br>
  You Must keep Scout Danarin Alive in order to complete the quest. After the 
  initial attack, you'll need to fight off one or two waves of grimlings before 
  the Grimling Officer will appear. Be warned that the Grimling Officer is 
  stronger than the others and cannot be Stunned, Mesmerized or the like. <br>
  <br>
  Excellent quest for a group of high 50s, or 10 level 40s.</span></b><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
