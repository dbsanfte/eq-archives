        rewards, trade skill items, and as loot off of monsters. There is a high 
        chance that we'll be upgrading many existing caster items to include 
        focus effects, to keep casters from needing to start from scratch with 
        their gear selections.&quot; </b></p>
        <p><b>That was posted upon 3/21/02, it is now 5/22/02. The question that 
        begs to be asked is where are these 'other' focus items? To date the 
        only non summoned focus item found is the 8th Shawl quest. </b></p>
        <p><b>You started off strong with caster balancing but lately... </b>
        </p>
        <p>Sorry about that. It’s no excuse, but the reality is that we have a 
        lot going on here, E3 not the least of them. It’s one rather complicated 
        balancing act. </p>
        <p>But I assure you that the work on balancing continues, as does the 
        work on the new interface and the bazaar. I’m not going to be able to 
        give you any solid dates, but hopefully we’ll have more for you on all 
        these items soon™. </p>
        <p>I have heard that the next steps in caster balance will be to finish 
        up with pets, then probably move on to the priest classes for a bit. </p>
        <p>Our desire is to do it properly, and for that we’ll just need more 
        time. All I can do is ask for your understanding and sympathize with 
        your frustration. We all want this to be done so we can move on to the 
        next thing, and the team is working very hard to make that happen. </p>
        <p><b>About the balancing, bazaar, interface, and such &quot;issues&quot;... what 
        I'm seeing a rather small company (Verant is still a small company, even 
        with the backing of Sony) trying to do too many things at once. I think 
        you'd have a better chance at getting things out on time if you'd make 
        less &quot;promises&quot; and just started working on one project or 2 at a time. 
        I understand research and development must go on for future projects, 
        but I personally don't care if the bazaar and new interface come out 
        late, but as yet they haven't come out at all. If you really have 2 full 
        teams, one working on each project, why not merge the 2, bust out ONE 
        project, then focus on the next? </b></p>
        <p><b>I thought of this as a distraction to cleaning my apartment, and 
        thinking &quot;why do I waste all my time trying to clean 4 rooms at once, 
        when I should just clean one to completion, then hit the next?&quot; </b></p>
        <p><b>Consider it. I'm sure you all have a lot more business training 
        than I do, but I've run a quite successful company on my own for over 5 
        years now and I cannot understand the logic of spreading your resources 
        (programmers) so thin. </b></p>
        <p>I’m not going to E3 this year. They didn’t need me for the booth so I 
        figured I’d stay here. </p>
        <p>As for resources, there’s a reason we can’t just drop everyone on one 
        project at a time. A lot of it has to do with job skills. You don’t 
        really want our designers doing PoP art, and our programmers don’t do 
        class balancing (though they do have their opinions…). So we just can’t 
        toss everyone at each project. </p>
        <p>And, using your example, it wouldn’t be all the useful to have 20 
        people cleaning your kitchen. With any project there’s a point where 
        more people don’t add to the speed the work gets done, and more than 
        that often slow things down. Heh, just picture a gaggle of artists 
        (that’s the official term for a bunch of artists, I think) trying to 
        model the same character… </p>
        <p>And a lot of project timing is out of our hands. We just can’t ask 
        them to hold off E3 for a month or two while we do other things. </p>
        <p>I can’t wait to hear the feedback from E3. I think we’ll impress at 
        least a few people. </p>

        <p align="left">Caster's Realm was able to preview the upcoming 
        Everquest Adventures (the PS/2 version of EQ) at the E3 computer show.&nbsp; 
        This is what they had to say.</p>
        <hr>
        <p align="center">
        <a href="http://eqoa.crgaming.com/editorials/vieweditorial.asp?Id=5">E3 
        PREVIEW, MAY 22, 2002</a></p>
        <p>Upon sitting on the comfy leather couch within the SOE booth I was 
        greeted by two television screens proudly displaying the EverQuest 
        Online Adventures welcome screen.&nbsp; I was a little skeptical about how 
        well the original EverQuest I had been a part of for over three years 
        would translate to the console environment but I found myself getting 
        more and more excited as the demonstration went on.</p>
        <p>The most noticeable feature of the new game is the user interface.&nbsp; 
        The design team spent over a year studying the most comonly used phrases 
        within EverQuest and most of these can now be accessed through a few 
        drop down menus and button pushes.&nbsp; Socializing was not in any way 
        cumbersome, and picking up a couple of travelling partners to group with 
        proved very easy and natural to accomplish.</p>
        <p>The demonstration commenced with the creation of the character for 
        the demonstration.&nbsp; Although EverQuest Online Adventures is based 
        earlier in time than the original EverQuest game, current players will 
        easily recognize the available classes.&nbsp; There is a slight variation in 
        the humans with an option of an Eastern or Western Human but for the 
        most part it is very similar.</p>
        <p>Combat is much faster and very far from the look and feel of the PC.&nbsp; 
        Spells, special attacks and other moves are quickly activated through 
        the hand controller.&nbsp; The difficulty of the NPC encounter can be 
        predicted through the use of a coloring system (blue, white, red, etc) 
        and and aggression type (likes, neutral, aggressive, etc).</p>
        <p>Players with broadband will be pleased to know the PS2 adaptor 
        required for this game will support ethernet connections, although the 
        game is being designed to run perfectly well on a 56K modem.</p>
        <p>Quests are much easier to navigate with prompt menus and a journal to 
        keep track of the original quest and your progress along it.</p>
        <p>Basic details on items, spells and abilities are available through 
        the menu interface.</p>
        <p>Advancement will be limited to 50 Levels which will take at least 500 
        hours online to complete (20 days online).</p>
        <p>New skills and abilities complement the Level system.&nbsp; These are 
        acquired both through speaking with ones trainer and doing quests.</p>
        <p>Also different to the original EverQuest, players will be able to 
        increase their base stats as they level and the dev team are confident 
        that stats will have more importance than they ended up having in the 
        original PC game.</p>
        <p>Players will have easy access to Sprit Binders who will be readily 
        available to set their respawn points and a transportation system will 
        also help in teleporting players around the world of Norrath.</p>
        <p>In all the game looks great, is easy to become immersed in and still 
        offers the wonderous world of adventure which made Norrath popular on 
        the PC.</p>
        <p>The game will, without a doubt, revolutionize MMOG's when it hits the 
        PS2 late in 2002.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Sounds like the PS/2 version of the game is going to be a good port 
        of the game.&nbsp; As information continues to appear, I'll make sure to 
        let you all know.</p>
        <p>When the game is released I'll add a section for it so you can have 
        one place to stop for all your information :)</p>

                        &nbsp;</font><p><font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Is it intended for players to be able to bind in the Timorous Deep 
                        once again? It has been reported on various sites that a 
                        player can cast bind, then camp, and then when he logs 
                        back on the player will be bound there.</b> </p>
                        <p>Yes and no. </p>
                        <p>This was something we were looking at changing some 
                        time in the future. As part of playing around with the 
                        idea, we initiated code on the Test server that allowed 
                        casters to bind in Timorous Deep again. That was 
                        probably six weeks ago, just after we stopped patching 
                        code for such a long time. </p>
                        <p>When it came time to patch code again the change to 
                        Timorous Deep went live, in a rather untested and 
                        unintended fashion. That’s why it’s not working 
                        perfectly, and that’s why it’s working at all. ;p </p>
                        <p>After pushing forward our examination of the idea of 
                        re-enabling binding in Timorous Deep, we’ve decided to 
                        allow it. However, because the implementation wasn’t 
                        planned to go in quite yet, we haven’t assigned the time 
                        to clear out the bugs. We’ll hunt them down when we get 
                        the chance. </p>
                        <p>So my suggestion would be to hold off binding 
                        yourself there until we get a shot at testing the change 
                        and patching the bugs. </p>

        </center>
        <p><b>SAN DIEGO, CA - May 13, 2002</b>&nbsp;-- Next week at the Electronic 
        Entertainment Expo (E3), in Los Angeles, Sony Online Entertainment 
        reinforces its commitment to multiplayer online gaming with the 
        announcement of a ground breaking line-up, including: <em>EverQuest®: 
        The Planes of Power™</em>, <em>PlanetSide™</em> and <em>EverQuest® II</em>. 
        Capitalizing on its game expertise and well-known properties SOE also 
        announced that the company will be taking its popular EverQuest property 
        to the console audience with the upcoming <em>EverQuest® Online 
        Adventures™</em> for the PlayStation®2 computer entertainment system. In 
        addition, SOE will become an official PlayStation 2 developer, 
        specializing in massively multiplayer online games, an entirely new 
        genre for the console player. SOE will be expanding massively 
        multiplayer games into new genres with <em>PlanetSide™</em> and <em>Star 
        Wars® Galaxies™</em>, both of which are currently in development. </p>
        <p>&quot;SOE's goal has always been to bring gamers new content and dynamic 
        communities,&quot; said Scott McDaniel, vice president of marketing, Sony 
        Online Entertainment. &quot;By continuing to expand the types of games 
        offered, we are driving the growth of the massively multiplayer market.&quot;
        </p>
        <p><i><u><b>EverQuest® Online Adventures™</b></u></i> </p>
        <p><em>EverQuest Online Adventures</em>, one of the first U.S., 
        online-only console games, brings the player interaction and community 
        that made the original EverQuest so popular to a whole new audience of 
        console gamers. <em>EverQuest Online Adventures</em> is a completely new 
        game, designed from the ground up with the console player in mind. But 
        like the original EverQuest, it will feature intricate character 
        development, continuous player interaction and a strong sense of 
        community to create an all-new phenomenon amongst PlayStation 2 system 
        owners. <em>EverQuest Online Adventures</em> will connect seamlessly to 
        the Internet, directing players to dedicated game servers helping to 
        ensure low latency gameplay and fast connection times. <em>EverQuest 
        Online Adventures</em> will be available in Spring 2003. </p>
        <p><i><u><b>EverQuest® II</b></u></i>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><em>EverQuest II</em>, based on the original EverQuest, will give 
        players an entirely new world to explore with a new 3D engine utilizing 
        cutting-edge hardware technology. Offering unparalleled character 
        customization capabilities, <em>EverQuest II</em> allows players to 
        fully customize their character's faces, hair and body types. Other new 
        features include player-owned real estate, player-controlled mounts, new 
        quest system, mechanically and visually enhanced combat systems and a 
        continued Norrathian storyline with new and familiar regions will 
        further broaden the EverQuest universe. <em>EverQuest II</em> will be 
        available in Fall 2003. </p>
        <p><i><u><b>EverQuest®: The Planes of Power™</b></u></i> </p>
        <p><em>EverQuest: The Planes of Power </em>is the fourth installment in 
        the best-selling, critically acclaimed EverQuest series. The new 
        expansion pack, due to ship this fall, will introduce more than 430,000 
        current EverQuest gamers to an arching storyline that takes players on 
        an epic adventure through The Planes of Power, home of the Gods of 
        Norrath. Hundreds of new items, compelling quests and encounters with 
        the most powerful deities in Norrath will keep even the most experienced 
        players challenged and enthralled. For more information please visit the 
        official Planes of Power Website at www.planesofpower.com. The Planes of 
        Power will be available this Fall. </p>
        <p><i><u><b>PlanetSide™</b></u></i> </p>
        <p>Massively multiplayer gaming takes on a new face in <em>PlanetSide</em>, 
        a game where thousands of players wage battle involving infantry, ground 
        vehicles, and aircraft in a globe-spanning, far-future war of epic 
        proportions. A new 3D engine designed for indoor and outdoor locations 
        allows seamless gameplay across continents with no load times or 
        interruptions. Lifelike graphics, changing weather effects, and ambient 
        environmental sounds will ensure realistic details that have never been 
        seen before in online gaming. This year at E3, <em>PlanetSide</em> will 
        be showcasing new content, an additional playable empire as well as the 
        full-scale version of all continents that measure approximately 64 
        square kilometers varying from arctic wastelands to scorching deserts. 
        Tactical decision making, adrenaline-inducing action, and social 
        involvement make for one of the most compelling game environments ever 
        created. <em>PlanetSide</em> will be available in Spring 2003. </p>
        <p><i><u><b>Star Wars® Galaxies™</b></u></i> </p>
        <p><em>Star Wars Galaxies</em> is the first massively multiplayer online 
        role-playing game set in the classic <em>Star Wars</em> universe. <em>
        Star Wars Galaxies</em> will feature dynamic role-playing and 
        ground-based adventures across multiple planets. Gameplay will offer a 
        unique combination of combat, exploration, social interaction, 
        specialized missions, and daring quests. <em>Star Wars Galaxies</em>, 
        published by LucasArts Entertainment Company and developed by Sony 
        Online Entertainment, is expected to be available this December. </p>

        This quest is unusual in EverQuest, as it was intended to be done once
