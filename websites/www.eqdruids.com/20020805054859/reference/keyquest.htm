Kill the Emperor of ssra and looting his staff. This Staff has 2 charges of Summon a Shaded Sphere. *one charge - 20 sources, so each staff produces 40 power sources.* <br> 4.

(uncommon)<br> 8. The Deep --- Any though horrors. Best drop rate is pass the invis bridge near THO area before Elder Thought Horrors. (uncommon)<br> 9. Acrylia --- 2 Skullcracker/Runed at the city gates. So far only seen shard drop from those 2 spawns. (uncommon)<br> 10. Maiden's Eye --- Goranga Prophet, Battlemaster, Seer, Forager, Savant. Not 100% drop. PH for the goranga named are Goranga Scouts. (very rare) This is the bottle neck shard.<br> <br> After you have your shards, get a glowing orb of luclinite (off almost any high level raid mob in Luclin, rhaq1 &amp;2, Grieg's, tho ect). Then get your scepter made...<br> <br> Head to Akheva. From the zone in, run straight, past the fallen pillar. When you get to the next room, head right. Going left will take you to Va'Dyn. Go down the next set of stairs. To your right is IV. Go left, you will see a large &quot;gate&quot; with two &quot;shades&quot; standing on the left and right edges of this gate. Clear them out. Then drop down from the stairs and you will see a number of green con &quot;Sacrificed Remains&quot; and a &quot;Shimmering Presence.&quot; <br> <br> From there you will need items from a mage and a Necro to continue the script. <br> <br> Dialogues and actions...<br> A shimmering presence's voice invades your mind. <br> 'Shadows can not exist without light. Bring me a wisp stone so that my balance can be righted by their soft glow. <br> <br> This points to a MAGICIAN SPELL: <br> Name: Summon Wisp <br> Level: 4 <br> Type: Summon a No-Rent Miscellaneous Object <br> Actual Effects: Summons Wisp <br> Description: This will summon a &quot;wisp stone&quot; that acts as a light source when worn for those who cannot see well at nighttime.<br> <br> Give the summoned Wisp stone and Spirit of Akelha `Ra will spawn. <br> <br> You say, 'Hail, The Spirit of Akelha`Ra'<br> The Spirit of Akelha`Ra 's hollow eyes look up at you. You have the distinct impression that she can see right into the darkest shadows of your soul. She opens her mouth to speak but the sounds you hear come from inside your mind. 'Greetings mortal, thank you for releasing me from my [tormented prison]. <br> You say, 'what tormented prison'<br> The Spirit of Akelha`Ra appears to be fading in and out of existence as you speak to her. The spirit's voice fills your mind. 'I am Akelha`Ra, once high priestess of Luclin and leader of the Akheva. This form you see before you now is a fading remnant of my former existence. The storm was the cause of my imprisonment in the world of undying [spirits]. <br> <br> You say, 'what spirit'<br> The Spirit of Akelha`Ra says 'We Akheva are immortal entities placed in this plane by the mistress of shadow. We are her most perfect creation. Death has no meaning to us, as even in death we find rebirth through the power of the mistress. My imprisonment was caused by my separation from the power of the mistress by [Atenha`Ra]. It was she who sent the storm to destroy me and all that followed me. '<br> <br> You say, 'who is atenha ra'<br> The Spirit of Akelha`Ra says 'It is more then a little ironic that Atenha`Ra is a reflection of myself. An entity created from my own consciousness, a reflection of a shadow. She now holds the seat of grand power in [Vex Thal], and I have not the power to gain entry to the city, let alone face her. You must find my scepter that was lost in the storm to gain entry to Vex Thal. The scepter has likely lost much of it's power from being shattered. Once it is reassembled you will need to merge a Orb of Luclinite with a source of celestial power inside the scepter. The spirits whisper that the emperor of the Shissar holds the power to manipulate such energy. Be weary of him, he is heralded as the slayer of gods, the defiler of realities. '<br> <br> You say, 'what Vex Thal'<br> The Spirit of Akelha`Ra says 'Vex Thal is the sacred home of the Akheva. The place where Luclin's power directly touches this world...ungh... I can not summon the frame of my scepter in my current weakened state. I need a soul to regain my pow...' As she speaks you can see her slowly fade out of existence. You wonder how long her spirit will stay with this world. She seems entirely unable to speak to you now, and can only muster the strength to point at the ground at Dimi 's feet. Dimi reaches down a picks up a small emerald off the ground, but it disappears silently into the shadows. Akelha`ra looks as if she is trying to speak again. '<br> <br> This points to a Emerald Essence. Hand it in to collect the Scepter Frame that will allow to reassemble the Scepter.<br> <br> You say, 'what frame of your scepter'<br> The Spirit of Akelha`Ra opens her mouth to speak, but the voice in your head is no longer audible.
