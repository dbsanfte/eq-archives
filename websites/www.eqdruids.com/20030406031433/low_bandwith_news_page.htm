normal web pages.</font></p>

        people doing spell research! 3/16/03</font></b></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">I do not have personal verification 
        of this, but I have heard it from several reliable sources.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Some of the spells may be easier to 
        obtain than we originally thought.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">If the spell crosses over different 
        classes (such as Levitation) you do not need to have the druid specific 
        combines for this spell.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Word is that any of the different INT 
        casters combines for this spell, also include druids on the scroll!&nbsp; 
        So if you can find the pieces for the Wizard version (to give an 
        example) a wizard would be able to make the combine and then you could 
        scribe that version of the spell!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Now before people get TOO excited at 
        this thought, I would like to have someone actually verify this.&nbsp; I 
        know for a fact that the spell scrolls are showing druids for one of the 
        classes, now someone just needs to verify that it can be scribed by a 
        druid.&nbsp; More than likely it is, but I want to know for sure :)</font></p>
