  <b><font face="Arial">You can only do this quest with a single group. 
  Completing this quest (or any of the other trials) will give you access to the 
  Plane of Storms and the Plane of Valor <br>
  <br>
  Talk to Mavuin in the basement cellblock. Hail him and follow the dialogue. He 
  will ask you to plead his case before the Tribunal, aggreeing will grant you a 
  character flag. <br>
  <br>
  Head to the area with The Tribunal, and ask them about Mavuin. Following the 
  dialog, saying &quot;I am prepared&quot; to each Tribunal will give you description of 
  the six trials. <br>
  <br>
  To do this one, say &quot;I am ready to begin the Trial of Lashing&quot;. Make sure you 
  are actually prepared when you say that because your group will be teleported 
  to the event area where you will only get a few seconds before things start.
  <br>
  <br>
  When you start this trial, you're staring at a T intersection, if you run 
  around to the left you'll see a cubby, and you'll realize that you are in a 
  hallway surrounding a center room. There is a door to the center room on the 
  opposite side from where you started the trial. 4 mobs spawn and two come from 
  each side doMl the hallway. Mez and kill one at a time as fast as possible. 
  These were shades and razorbeasts and hit for 280-300ish. After you kill all 
  4, if you were fast, a Wraith of Agony will spawn in the middle room, kill 
  wraith (similar to ~e other mobs) and an ae heal spell will go off. Rinse and 
  repeat for 4 rounds to reach the boss. The Boss is similar to the boss of 
  execution, hits for 700s with an added twist of a 100 hp AE every 9 seconds 
  that has a small knockback to interrupt spells. <br>
  <br>
  Finishing this gives you the Mark of Torture. <br>
  <br>
  Now talk to the Tribunal and say &quot;what evidence of Mauvuin&quot; and they will tell 
  you that they have consented to hear Mauvuin's case. Head back down and talk 
  to him and he will ask you to go see Karana and Mithaniel Marr. This will flag 
  you to be able to enter the Plane of Storms and and Plane Valor. <br>
