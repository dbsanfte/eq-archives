Shortly thereafter, other gods made a pact to divide up the world, each wanting to stake their claim with beings of their own creation. Luclin watched from the shadows while the other gods went about making order out of chaos in their own twisted ways. She saw the plotting, the petty bickering, and the various power plays for which the gods have always been known.</font></p><p><font face=Arial>Abandoning Norrath, Luclin claimed the barren and forgotten ringed rock orbiting the planet for her own. Unopposed and through the sheer power of her will and magic, she gave life to the moon that now bears her name. In addition to the creations of the Mistress of Shadows, the moon of Lucin has since become home to several of Norrath's races, either by choice or by force.</font></p><p><font face=Arial>The serpent race known as the Shissar, one-time slavemasters to the Iksar lizardmen, escaped to Luclin to escape extinction at the hands of their gods. The Shissar's brutal disloyalty and blasphemous pride angered their deities, whose retribution came in the form of a vast, horrible plague - the Green Mist. The ancient magic of the Shissar race enabled them to escape, secretly, to the surface of Luclin, where they created &quot;The Grey&quot;, a dome of vacuum around their settlement, to protect them. For centuries, they were thought extinct by those left behind on Norrath.</font></p><p><font face=Arial>The Combine Empire, once powerful and nearly all encompassing on Norrath, fled to Luclin after divisiveness within the empire nearly destroyed it. The poisoning and near murder of the empire's founder, Tsaf Katta, provided the impetus for those still dedicated to peace and harmony to gather what they could, creating new magics out of necessity, and travel to Luclin. Their enemies within the empire followed close behind them, anxious to maintain their power and influence. Leaders and powerful figures of both factions migrated and have tried to rebuild on the moon. The once great empire continues on Luclin, split and now a shadow of its former power.</font></p><p><font face=Arial>The Vah Shir, once members of a larger tribe of cat people on Norrath, lived on Odus for many centuries and thrived. When the followers of Erud, styling themselves &quot;high men&quot; arrived to stablish their own colony, there were conflicts between the two groups, neither of which deigned to compromise. A small village of these Kerrans is believed by some to have been caught in the crossfire between the high men of Erudin and a group of heretic necromancers they had ousted from their city when civil war broke out on Odus. They were deposited forcefully on Luclin, blasted to the surface of that satellite along with a sizable chunk of Norrath, in a disastrous test of the great weapon that created the abyss now known as The Hole.</font></p><p><font face=Arial>The moon of Luclin is in perfect balance - one side bathed forever in light, and the other blanketed in darkest night. The earliest arrivals fet an eerie and disturbing presence when approaching the Twilight between the two areas. Those not native to the moon quickly learned to avoid these dangerous lands. Ironically, it is said that those of good and honest nature made their homes in the darkness, and those of a darker nature chose the light.</font></p></font><font SIZE=5 face=Arial><i><b><p>The Vah Shir</p></b></i></font><font SIZE=2><u><p><font face=Arial>The History</font></p></u><p><font face=Arial>The Vah Shir originated from one of the ancient Kerran nomad &quot;komiyat&quot; (tribes) led by Kejaan Kerrath. Long ago his tribe, known as the Komiyat Kerrath, roamed the continent now known as Odus, taming the mighty beasts and driving out the evil creatures who lived there. They were the Kerran elite who, under Kejaan's leadership, were ultimatedly responsible for uniting the splintered tribes into one nation of Kerrans. Once done, Kejaan was proclaimed king and spiritual advisor of the united komiyat, and the golden age of Kerra began.</font></p><p><font face=Arial>Peace and prosperity were short-lived. As the Erudites arrived, bringing with them new sicknesses, a great plague swept across the land taking the lives of many Kerrans. Even the mightiest and strongest of spirit were not spared from its onslaught. The surviving Kerrans firmly believed that this disease was caused by the increasing practice of necromancy by a splinter group of Erudites. When the plague took the life of Kejaan, his son Vah Kerrath grimly prepared the Kerran nobility to make war upon the heretics.</font></p><p><font face=Arial>Unbeknownst to Vah Kerrath, the Erudites had similar plans. To their thinking, the heretics had long since abandoned the teachings of Erud in their pursuit of the forbidden art. Their vile brethren deserved no less than extinction for their blasphemy, a sentence that would certainly be carried out by the loyal Erudites themselves.</font></p><p><font face=Arial>What happens next, no one knows for certain. Some say that there was an attack upon Paineel by the Erudites. Others say that it was Vah Kerrath who moved first. Still others claim that the cataclysmic event was entirely coincidental. All that can be agreed upon is that when the dust settled, most of Paineel was gone, along with the entirety of a nearby city of Kerrans. All that was left was a massive abyss, known today as &quot;The Hole.&quot;</font></p><p><font face=Arial>We know now that Vah Kerrath and his followers found themselves on the dark side of the nearby moon called Luclin. Referring to themselves now as the Vah Shir, they held their ground in the hostile environment and in time flourished as a new kingdom, unknown and forgotten by those on Norrath.</font></p><u><p><font face=Arial>The Vah Shir Strengths and Weaknesses</font></p></u><p><font face=Arial>The Vah Shir are massive and strong, not unlike the barbarian Northmen of Norrath. Untrusting of written research, they turn instead to spirituality and folklore as their guide to daily life. Their culture flourishes with poets and shamans. Although they retain the great wisdom of their ancestors throughout the ages, their hesitance to study literature and perform magical research limits their intelligence and ability to wield the magic that may appear in other societies. The Vah Shir are not the most charismatic race, however, some Vah Shir excel at expression through song, art, and poetry.</font></p><p><font face=Arial>Vah Shir are hunters and warriors fighting for the honor of their king and their kin. The Vah Shir adapt easily to the civilized life as tribesmen as well as the rigors of hunting in the wilderness. Vah Shir hunters are able to hide within the forests and stalk their prey in silence. Their strong spirituality gives them a keen affinity to the beasts of the wild as well as the realm of spirits.</font></p><p><font face=Arial>Due to their outstanding agility, the Vah Shir are able to fall great distances sustaining little or no damage. Their excellent night vision allows them to hunt well on the dark side of Luclin. These great beasts require large amounts of food to sustain their massive, yet agile bodies.</font></p></font><p align=justify><font face=Arial><br> &nbsp;</font></p></td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr></table><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td><p align=center style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size=1>All information contained on this website copyright Thistlethorne Enterprises 2001-2002.&nbsp; Everquest copyright Sony Inc.</font></p></td></tr></table><!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table><!--msnavigation--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td><p align=center style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size=1>All information contained on this website copyright Thistlethorne Enterprises 2001-2002.&nbsp; Everquest copyright Sony Inc.</font></p></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table></body></html>
