  <b><font face="Arial">Talk to Mavuin in the basement cellblock. Hail him and 
  follow the dialogue. He will ask you to plead his case before the Tribunal, 
  aggreeing will grant you a character flag. <br>
  <br>
  Head to the area with The Tribunal, and ask them about Mavuin. Following the 
  dialog, saying &quot;I am prepared&quot; to each Tribunal will give you description of 
  the six trials. <br>
  <br>
  To do this one, say &quot;I am ready to begin the trial of hanging.&quot; Make sure you 
  are actually prepared when you say that because your group will be teleported 
  to the event area where you will only get a few seconds before things start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two mobs + Spirit of Suffocation spawn at the beginning, kill Spirit then get 
  on a mob, another spirit will spawn, kill the spirit right away. Basically 
  each wave will be 2 mobs and 2 spirits, but only 1 <br>
  spirit can be up at one time. Razorbeasts are unmezzable, air elementals are 
  mezzable. There will be messages to tell you how long you have to kill the 
  spirit of suffocation before you lose. If one of the 3 hanging people falls 
  over on the ground, KILL IT FAST , otherwise you will lose. After the spirits 
  of suffocation are dead in the 4th wave, the boss will spawn. When we spawned 
  the boss we had 3 mobs up that were mezzed still from previous rounds. Boss is 
  an enchanter, hits for 720 max and rampages. He's about as tough as all the 
  other ones. <br>
  <br>
  Finishing this gives you the Mark of Hanging. <br>
  <br>
  Now talk to the Tribunal and say &quot;what evidence of Mauvuin&quot; and they will tell 
  you that they have consented to hear Mauvuin's case. Head back down and talk 
  to him and he will ask you to go see Karana and Mithaniel Marr. This will flag 
  you to be able to enter the Plane of Storms and and Plane Valor</font></b><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
