Not only do you gain added protection, and can tackle stronger targets, but you also minimize your down time. In the long run, this allows you to advance in level faster and more safely. It should also be stated that many single monsters that considers blue to you, you will not be able to take down by yourself.</p><p>What is essential in grouping is knowing your strengths and weaknesses, and the strengths and weaknesses of your party members. This will determine your &quot;role&quot; in the group. Because a group member's role is generally determined by the encounter, this guide will focus on a druid's <u>typical</u> role within a normal experience group.</p><a name=Heal><p><font size=3 color=008000><b>Healing:</p></b></font></a><p>There are two different parts to this topic. Being the sole (primary) healer in a group, or having multiple (secondary) healers in a group. Two different tactics will be shown but although you have to have at least one healer, it is much safer to have two.</p><p align=left><u>Primary Healer:</u></p><p align=left>It is important if you are the primary healer of a group to be prepared to acquire &quot;heal-aggro&quot;. Simply put, when you cast a healing spell, the monsters in the vicinity treat you as if you damaged them for the amount you healed a group member. Thus if you cast greater heal on a party member, ALL of the monsters will each think you did 270 points of damage to them.</p><p>This moves you up on the mobs' hate list, and can lead to a quick demise, prevent you from healing later, and disable your many other abilities. (In other words it will get you killed, and without a healer in the group your party will not last long.)</p><p>Because of this, it is best to heal sparingly, and not chain-heal unless absolutely necessary. You will still cause heal-aggro, but not to the degree that your tank won't be able to taunt it off you.</p><p>If you do get attacked, immediately call out &quot;<b>ON ME</b>&quot; (or something similar) to signal to your group members they need to pull the monsters attacking you off you as soon as possible. This also goes with groups using multiple healers. However, do not run around trying to shake the mob off. This makes it difficult for your party to taunt it off you and back onto the main tank.</p><p><u>Secondary Healer:</u></p><p>In almost all high-level dungeon areas where there are multiple monsters that rush the party at once, you almost definitely need more than one healer.</p><p>At the forming of the group and before you go adventuring, make sure it is clear who is the primary healer and who is the secondary healer. The primary healer's role is generally to keep the main tank, and any additional tanks, alive. The secondary healer's role is typically to keep the primary healer alive (if necessary) and any party member that should require it (such as an enchanter, or bard).</p><p>If the primary healer is unable to heal due to aggro, the secondary can take over the healing while the rest of the group tries to wrestle the extra monsters off the primary healer.</p><p>When healing, never let your group members fall below two bubbles of health. This ensures that your party is as safe as they can be during all moments of battle. A skilled cleric can (and often does) allow the main tank to fall to 40% health, due to the effectiveness of their Complete Heal. However, druids do not receive this spell, thus can not fall behind in healing.</p><p align=left><a href=#Contents><font face Arial size=2>Back To Top</font></a></p><a name=Evac><p><font size=3 color=008000><b>Group Gates and Emergency Gates:</b></font></a></p><p>Druids and wizards have the ability to group gate, but druids can do so at an earlier level. This allows the druid to do two things:</p><ol><li>Reduce travel times to dungeons. <li>Allowing the druid to evacuate the party when a fight in a dungeon gets out of hand.</ol><p>Keep in mind that group gate spells take a very long time to cast. Therefore the druid should always have a Succor spell memorized when exploring a dungeon. This spell takes half the time of the normal gate spells to cast, thus making letting it have a higher chance of getting off without getting interrupted.</p><p>This line of spells does have a chance of leaving a group member behind. Should the need to evacuate arise, all party members should run to the druid immediately so they do not get left behind. The radius of the spell is limited, so make sure you get close enough. A rule of thumb is, if you cannot hear the spell sound (sounds like thunder) then you are too far away.</p><p>Druids need to be prepared to cast succor. Druids always need to reserve some mana (usually about 20%) to ensure that the escape route is always available. This spell still takes a long time to cast, and the group members need to ensure that the druid is relatively safe at all times.</p><p>Because this spell takes a long time to cast, the druid needs to remember a few things: <ul><li>Try to stay low on the hate list by not overcasting a heal, snare, or damage spell. Being high on the hate list will cause the monsters to attack you, thus preventing you from being able to cast succor. <li>When fighting spell casters, never stand near the monsters. If the spell casters cast an area affect spell and it hits you, it has a chance of interrupting your spell, especially if the spell makes you move a little bit. <li>Also, standing away from the target lessens the chance that a monster might decide to take a quick swing at you.</ul><p></p><p align=left><a href=#Contents><font face Arial size=2>Back To Top</font></a></p><a name=Buff><p><b><font size=3 color=008000>Buffing:</font></b></a></p><p>Druids get some buffs they can cast in dungeons: Skin, Strength, Regeneration, and Damage Shields. If hunting in an outdoor area, we can also utilize Pack Spirit, or Share Wolf Form.</p><p>When buffing your party members, cast each buff at the same time as you cast them on yourself. This allows you to know exactly when a spell expires without having the need for your members to remind you all the time. Only buff party members that really need it, such as tanks, healers, and anyone who does crowd-control (usually enchanters). Since they will be dealing and taking the majority of the damage, you need to make sure they are well protected. Do not waste your spells on non-essential members. It simply increases your down time.</p><p>If you have a cleric in the group, let them do all of the hitpoint and armor class buffs while you do the other buffs. Cleric and druid hitpoint buffs do not stack, and the clerical versions of the same level are generally more powerful. If you have a shaman in the group let them do all of the buffs. You can still cast your skin buff, since those are stackable with shaman armor class buff spells. In addition to this, shamans have much more powerful stat affecting boosts than any other class. Again, make sure that only the essential members of the group get buffed, or it will increase your down time with no benefit.</p><p>Damage shields are the druid's most useful combat buff, and they stack with all other buffs except for a wizard's own damage shield. Cast these spells before you pull monsters. It will usually last the duration of the encounter, so you will not need to keep refreshing it during the battle. Never start a battle without it. The mana cost of these spells is relatively small, and the damage they do can be significant. In a melee encounter where the target hits hard and often, damage shields can help to reduce the length of the battle, and can often be the determining factor in difficult encounters.</p><p align=left><a href=#Contents><font face Arial size=2>Back To Top</font></a></p><a name=Med><p><b><font size=3 color=008000>Meditating or Fighting:</font></b></a></p><p>Because druids lack prowess in melee, a druid should not melee unless they are full of mana and the encounter is under control.</p><p>Meditate as often as allowed. Use mana-increasing spells and items to your advantage. The key is to have as much mana as possible. This allows you more room for error, should you need to cast more offensive spells, or for you to cast additional heals.</p><p>Another important reason to meditate is your succor spell. Because you need to reserve 20% of your mana for that spell alone, you are limited to 80% of your total mana pool for everything else. If you are fighting in battle and use up 80% of your mana, tell your group &quot;<b>OOM!!</b>&quot;. This signals to them that you cannot cast anymore spells and need to meditate.</p><p align=left><a href=#Contents><font face Arial size=2>Back To Top</font></a></p><a name=Aggro><p><b><font size=3 color=008000>Aggro Management:</font></b></a></p><p>It's all too easy to over cast, and move up quickly on the target's hate list. In a normal group, it's very important to have the main tank maintain aggro over the target. This allows the target(s) to be dispatched in a more efficient manner.</p><p>There are several factors that can shift aggro from one player to another: <ul><li>Potential to harm a target (large damage spells, chain-casting, large healing spells, etc.) <li>Player level (in general, lower = more aggro) <li>Sitting (causes huge aggro) <li>Proximity to target</ul><p></p><p>There are two basic methods of reshifting aggro back to the main tank. One is to root the target and back off to allow the main tank sufficient time to reacquire aggro. The second is to stand still and take some damage and allow the main tank to reacquire aggro, then back out of melee range once he has done so. There are other methods, which depend upon the specific encounter.</p><p>The key to preventing this is to know when to begin casting. Generally, you should allow the main tank to do damage equal to approximately 25% of the target's total hitpoints before casting. A good tip is to allow the tank to tell everyone when they can assist him (they are good judges of when they have acquired sufficient aggro). This mainly applies to heals and debuffs.</p><p>Attempting to outdamage the main damage dealers is not a good idea, unless it's an emergency. In general, if you need to cast a damage spell, wait until the target is below 50% health.</p><p>Lastly, if there are multiple healers in the party, you can alternate the role of primary healer. What this effectively does is spread the aggro around, so it's not all built up on one player.</p><p align=left><a href=#Contents><font face Arial size=2>Back To Top</font></a></p><a name=Snare><p><font size=3 color=008000><b>Snaring or Rooting:</b></font></a></p><p>Always have one or the other memorized (or both). These spell lines are essential in controlling the encounter, by preventing runners. They are also utilized heavily in crowd control, and separating additions so as to allow the party to focus on one mob at a time.</p><p>Our root spell has two components to it, a movement adjusting part, and a damage component. It's generally resisted more often than a normal root. Thus, if possible, have someone else root when necessary.</p><p>When rooting, make sure you do so before it is about to flee, or it just might get past that turn and get our of your line of sight.</p><p>Ensnare is normally better. Its resisted less often and has the same effect when the monster tries to flee. Since the movement of the creature is not actually halted, it will not keep attacking the party when it tries to flee. This is not true with the pure root spells. In addition to this, ensnare has a very low mana cost and a long duration.</p><p align=left><a href=#Contents><font face Arial size=2>Back To Top</font></a></p><a name=Dungeon><p><b><font size=3 color=008000>Dungeon Traps:</font></b></a></p><p>Many of the higher level dungeons have traps in them. If a group member falls down the trap, tell them not to move. Usually when the member falls down, they will attempt to return to the party. This succeeds in only doing two things:</p><ol><li>Brings a large train of monsters to the party <li>Causes the trapped member to die before the party can reach them.</ol><p>You do have the ability to heal through walls. Thus if a party member falls down a hole and gets separated, the healer can still keep that person alive. In addition to this, it allows the healer to lure the monsters off the trapped person and keep them safe. Remember, if you fall down a trap, do not move, call your group, and have them rescue you. If it becomes viable to do so, have the members get close to the druid and just teleport out to safety. This spell does teleport between floors since it is a global diameter instead of a plane.</p><p align=left><a href=#Contents><font face Arial size=2>Back To Top</font></a></p><a name=Spells><p><font size=3 color=008000><b>Spell Lineup:</b></font></a></p><p>In general, a druid should have the following spell lines memorized. Different situations may call for the use of other spells (such as levitate, or enduring breath). Adapt as necessary to the specific encounter. <ul><li>Heal spell <li>Skin line <li>Coat line <li>Damage shield <li>Direct Damage <li>Ensnare <li>Endure Magic <li>Succor spell</ul><p align=left><a href=#Contents><font face Arial size=2>Back To Top</font></a></p></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></table></center></font><p align=justify><br> <a href=../reference/library.htm>Back to Main</a></p></td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr></table><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td><p align=center style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size=1>All information contained on this website copyright Thistlethorne Enterprises 2001-2002.&nbsp; Everquest copyright Sony Inc.</font></p></td></tr></table><!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table><!--msnavigation--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td><p align=center style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size=1>All information contained on this website copyright Thistlethorne Enterprises 2001-2002.&nbsp; Everquest copyright Sony Inc.</font></p></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table></body></html>
