Druzzil sacrificed a small portion of her own place to create a new realm to be dominated by Ayonae Ro, the Demi-Plane of Music. Ayonae can not only cause others to become caught up in her music to the point of feeling the emotions therein, she is able to mold and shape the very realm in which she lives, much as her mother does with her own magical skills.</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p><p align=justify style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face=Arial><b><span class=libtitle>Druzzil Ro</span> &nbsp;&nbsp; <span class=libsubtitle>The Matron of the Art</span> <br> &nbsp;</b></font></p><p align=justify style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face=Arial>Druzzil has white hair which is held back from her face by a massive platinum crown with a single white gem that blazes like a brilliant white star upon her brow. She is tall, youthful in appearance, with a resemblance to Erudite in skin and body structure. The Demi-Plane of Magic became the home of the goddess of magic. In its natural state, it is an infinitely expansive plane of perfect white and unblemished marble under a gray and featureless sky, though one would likely never glimpse her plane in such a state. Through the will of Druzzil Ro, her home takes the shape, form and features that reflect her current mood. Her plane is simply a canvas for her art.</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p><p align=justify style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face=Arial><b><span class=libtitle>Luclin</span> &nbsp;&nbsp; <span class=libsubtitle>The Maiden of Shadows</span> <br> &nbsp;</b></font></p><p align=justify style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face=Arial>Luclin, the Maiden of Shadows rules the Plane of Shadow, She is short of stature, about 4'9&quot; tall; sleek and thin, with an elfin body structure. Her short hair is deep gray with long side locks down to her stomach. Her silver eyes have no pupils and her skin is solid black. She wears black and gray robes and a shadowy mist perpetually swirls around her feet. In one hand she bears a massive silver and platinum staff carved in the shape of two tendrils wrapping around one another to form two humanoid hands at the top. Floating just above the cupped palms of the hands is a small black orb whose surface has an iridescent sheen similar to that of oil.</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p><p align=justify style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face=Arial><b><span class=libtitle>Morell Thule</span> &nbsp;&nbsp; <span class=libsubtitle>The Lord of Dreams</span></b></font></p><p align=justify style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face=Arial><b><br> </b>Morell-Thule, the Lord of Dreams rules the Demi-Plane of Dreams where he is responsible for the rich texture of sleep visions. He creates, animates and thoroughly enjoys the creatures who romp in his realm. Though nearly seven feet tall and well built, he has handsome and youthful features. His body habitus is that of a pure white centaur with the tail of a lion. His silver hooves sparkle constantly because of the unicorn-like horn on his brow. That horn is not made of hair as with most such protuberances, but is purely a thing of light. His long hair grows down his spine and ends in a glistening white mane which, with his pale skin, set off his beautiful green eyes.</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p><p align=justify style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face=Arial><b><span class=libtitle>Saryrn</span> &nbsp;&nbsp; <span class=libsubtitle>The Mistress of Torment and Pain</span> <br> &nbsp;</b></font></p><p align=justify style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face=Arial>Born a woman of striking beauty, she now rules the Demi-Plane of Pain, a hot, damp and uncomfortable place with no flat surfaces on which to walk. Instead the ground is cluttered with small, closely placed, stalagmites of smooth obsidian. Saryrn busies herself by spending personal time with those cursed enough to live in her realm. She captures and torments her subjects mentally and physically and completely at random. The length of their torment before she releases them again, is also completely random - based mainly upon her whims. Those who fall into her hands may suffer but a few moments or for months at a time. All live with the fear that at any time, she may choose them as a partner.</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p><p align=justify style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face=Arial><b><span class=libtitle>Tallon Zek</span> &nbsp;&nbsp; <span class=libsubtitle>The Beholder of Battle</span> <br> &nbsp;</b></font></p><p align=justify style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face=Arial>Known as the Beholder of Battle and as a master of strategy, Tallon Zek resides on the Plane of War along with his alter ego Vallon Zek.

During her lifetime, she was a dedicated devout Cazicite, though a combination of religious zeal and prophetic visions stripped from her any semblance of sanity. Lifted up by her deity and given her own domain, the power of her madness shaped it into the semblance of old Paineel after its destruction. From her realm, Vazaelle occasionally foresees an event in the future of some unsuspecting Norrathian citizen, whose life will change drastically when that event occurs. Depending on the severity of Vazaelle's mental state during the vision, that poor individual will know some degree of madness for the rest of their days, suffering from the touch of Vazaelle the Mad.</font></p><p align=justify style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p><p align=justify style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face=Arial><b><span class=libtitle>Zebuxoruk</span> &nbsp;&nbsp; <span class=libsubtitle>The Forsaken</span> <br> &nbsp;</b></font></p><p align=justify style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face=Arial>Zebuxoruk is neither evil nor good.

Zebuxoruk was at some time in the form of mortal man and trod upon the surface of Norrath after escaping the Plane of Justice or the Void. Mortality was either something forced upon him or something he may have wished for.
