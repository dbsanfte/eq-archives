  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">Ah Fan Faire.&nbsp; How shall I sum you up.&nbsp; Lets go 
  with the good, the bad, and the ugly.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">The panels were very very worthwhile.&nbsp; The developers 
  had a lot to say.&nbsp; The transcripts will be out soon, so I'm going to hit 
  a few of the things they said.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">One very important thing to remember when you read the 
  below and the transcripts.&nbsp; The team that is working on EQ is completely 
  new for the most part.&nbsp; So they can't just go in and &quot;make a quick 
  change&quot;.&nbsp; In a lot of cases they are having to completely rewrite 
  sections of the game (like adding the extra bank space).&nbsp; So trust me 
  when I say there is a TON of stuff they want to do, and just may not be able 
  to.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">Yes they would love to add more spell slots, it is just a 
  question of resources.&nbsp; Many of them play casters, they understand the 
  pain.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">Melee is going to have more changes coming to them, some 
  things were over done, some under etc.&nbsp; </font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">The Rathe encounter is being looked at.&nbsp; They realized 
  they may have made that one a touch too hard.&nbsp; However, plane of time is 
  finished no matter what rumors are running around.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">The Druid Bear pet was put in as a toy for druids, not a 
  full pet.&nbsp; I think we all knew this :)</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">They are going to continue to try and communicate changes 
  as fast as they can to the public at large.&nbsp; </font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">More will come out with the transcripts.&nbsp; The EQ2 talk 
  was AWESOME.&nbsp; If you want to read more on that,
  <a href="fan_faire-vegas_eq2.htm">go to my EQ2 info</a>.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">The costumes at the costume contest were just fantastic.&nbsp; 
  Some incredible stuff there (yes, pictures are coming)</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">That was the good.&nbsp; Seeing old friends, meeting new 
  friends was also of course a good thing.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">The bad.&nbsp; Underutilizing the space they had available!&nbsp; 
  You walk into a hall that (I kid not) is about the size of a football field, 
  yet they are only using a corner of it in rooms.&nbsp; SPREAD out!</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">Listing our races on our badge?&nbsp; Really would have 
  been better to list our classes.&nbsp; Makes more sense to this poor tired 
  druid.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">Showing us the EQ2 demo at the Friday night reception was a 
  great idea, having to turn the lights up and down and up and down cuz they 
  couldn't see the keyboard.&nbsp; Tsk tsk, get a flashlight! :)</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">The ugly.&nbsp; No one even if they had a blood hound was 
  going to be able to find me unless they had tracking.&nbsp; Finding anyone in 
  the Fan Faire was a major problem.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">Please please PLEASE in future Fan Faires, put up more 
  signs!!&nbsp; 80% of all the confusion people were having could have been 
  stopped by having just a few more signs explaining what was where!</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">And lastly, this goes out to that special waitress at 
  Quarks who told myself and my party, that we couldn't sit down with another 
  group of people that had invited us to their table, because we hadn't waited 
  in line.&nbsp; Not because we were going to take a table from someone else 
  (there was a ton of empty tables) but because we hadn't waited in line.&nbsp;
  </font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">Overall am I glad I went to Fan Faire, sure.&nbsp; Do I see 
  room for improvements in the execution of Fan Faire in the future, yep.&nbsp; 
  But hey, everyone gets better with age.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">Now lets get back on with life, tomorrow I'll get the pics 
  up I promise.&nbsp; Until then, enjoy the night.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
