            One hand weapons are the way to go in my opinion.&nbsp; 
            They are the ones you will normally use, so you can keep your 
            offhand free for a shield, or magic item.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">
            <span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight:700">
            Now, you need to make a decision.&nbsp; One hand blunt is 
            the normal weapon of choice of most Druids.&nbsp; But in their mighty 
            wisdom, Verant made our Epic weapon a one hand slash scimitar (I 
            won't guess what was going to make that happen! &lt;grin&gt;).&nbsp; So, if you 
            are planning on your epic, I would suggest finding a one hand slash 
            weapon that you can use, and practicing with it.&nbsp; You don't want to 
            try to learn one handed slash when you are in your 50's, trust me!</span></p>

            The Self-Only teleport spells, or &quot;rings&quot;, are first 
            gained at level 19. The first set allow you to port to : North 
            Karana, West Commonlands, Tox. Forest, Butcherblock Mountains, 
            Surefall and Combines (Dreadlands). At level 24, you receive self 
            only ports to: Steamfont Mountains, Lavastorm Mountains, The 
            Feerrott, South Ro Desert. At Level 29, you receive the last self 
            only port, to Misty Thicket. The group teleport spells, or 
            &quot;circles&quot;, are first gained at level 29. You receive them in the 
            same order as the self only ports, with the addition of Circle of 
            the Combines, (Dreadlands) and Circle of Iceclad Ocean at 34, and 
            Wind of the North (Skyfire Mountains) and Circle of Great Divide at 
            39, along with Wind of the South (Emerald Jungle), also at 39.&nbsp; And

            No. A druid is part of the &quot;Priest&quot; line of classes.

            WIS as our mana base.&nbsp; We are also able to wear leather based

            Evac, or succor spells have a lower casting time, 
            making them ideal for just that, evacuations. Because of this lower 
            casting time, there is a small chance you will leave one of your 
            party behind when you evacuate (which can be the caster also).</span></p>

            Generally, no. They tend to break a lot more often, 
            and easily than the Wizard/Cleric/Enchanter &quot;Root&quot; spell. The reason 
            for this, is because our root spells also have a damage component to 
            them.&nbsp; So when you cast the spell, there is a check against the root 
            being resisted and also a check against the damage being resisted.&nbsp; 
            If either is resisted, the whole cast is resisted.</span></p>

            Harmony is one of the best spells a druid has.&nbsp; The 
            ability to pull single pulls from a group of NPCs, without pulling 
            all of them is an incredible benefit as a class. Learn to use the 
            spell, practice with green mobs.&nbsp; Knowing how to use Harmony is a 
            strength that will benefit you for a long time. Remember though, 
            Harmony is an outdoor only spell. </span></p>

            Kiting is a reference to using our Damage over Time 
            spells to kill a monster.&nbsp; The basic premise of kiting is you sow 
            yourself.&nbsp; Then snare the monster you want to kill.&nbsp; Then cast a 
            damage over time on the creature.&nbsp; Keep running out of range from

            under 5 or 6 right click and it will allow you to put in another key 
            below the number already there. I put in the UP arrow. Back out and 
            then put your forage skill in the number for which you changed the 
            key(5 or 6). Now every time you hit that key, in my case run 
            forward, you will attempt to forage if it is up. went from 40 to 145
