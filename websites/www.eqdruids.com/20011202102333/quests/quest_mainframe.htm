<p>I don't want to make this quest page an &quot;every quest in Everquest is
listed here&quot; type quest page.&nbsp; I think <a href="http://www.everlore.com">Everlore</a>
, <a href="http://www.eqmaps.com">Eqmaps</a> , and <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com">Allakhazam's</a>
do a very nice job in being the main source for all quests.</p>
<p>What I've tried to do is make a quest area that would be of particular
interest to Druids.&nbsp; All the quests listed below give an item that is druid
useable.&nbsp; I think that gives us a nice reference for when you are trying to
upgrade some of your equipment, or when you are looking for a quest that has a
reward that you can use.</p>
<p>I am sure, I have missed some quests.&nbsp; There are a LOT of them out
there and I don't think by any means did I find them all.&nbsp; So, if you know
of a quest that I haven't listed below that you feel would be a good addition
for all of us, please <a href="mailto:spiritual_thistlethorne@hotmail.com">submit
it to me</a> so I can add the quest for everyone!</p>

<p>One of the most asked for quests&nbsp; I will link to here :)&nbsp; It is
the <a href="veliousquestarmors.htm">Velious Armor Quests</a>.&nbsp; The page
shows all the armors, what you need to get them, and what stats they have!.</p>
