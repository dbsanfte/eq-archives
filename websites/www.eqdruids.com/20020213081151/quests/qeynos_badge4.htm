      <span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Verdana; font-weight:700">This
      is the fourth Qeynos badge quest. You must do the other three first.<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'Hail, Vegalys Keldrane'<br>
      <br>
      Vegalys Keldrane says 'Greetings to you, citizen. By order of the Council
      of Qeynos I have been given the duty of apprehending the individuals
      [responsible] for unleashing this terrible plague upon the people and the
      lands of Antonius Bayle. The more I look into this matter, the more I come
      to find that this will be no easy task.<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'i wish to advance further'<br>
      <br>
      Vegalys Keldrane says 'Interested in helping us further? We continue to
      gather valuable information. We still require [interrogators] that are
      able to pry the information we require out those less then willing to
      talk. Also, Velarte Selire at the Temple of Life is looking for help with
      his [research] so you may wish to talk with him. Lastly, we now have
      information we believe may lead us to the [individual that unleashed this
      plague] in the first place.<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'what individual that unleashed this plague'<br>
      <br>
      Vegalys Keldrane says 'The plague was unleashed by a woman named Azibelle
      Spavin. She was the bodyguard and some say concubine of Mordavin Telase.
      He was put to death for his long list of crimes against Qeynos which
      included murder, treason and attempted genocide. The plague is apparently
      her revenge. I sent one of my investigators and one of the best guardsmen
      we have to try and find her and bring her to justice. They are [still
      missing].<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'still missing'<br>
      <br>
      Vegalys Keldrane says 'Kane recommended Guard Helminth personally as one
      of his best. They must have run into serious trouble. These were two of
      Qeynos' finest. I am only willing to send those with both strength and
      intelligence down there to complete this mission and find our people's
      whereabouts. Give me your Researcher's Badge should you wish to accept
      this mission.<br>
      <br>
      Hand in your Research's Badge at this point.<br>
      <br>
      Vegalys Keldrane says 'Here is my personal seal. Go to the sewers and
      locate my investigator and show him this seal if he yet lives. Find out
      what happened to he and guard Helminth. Then if at all possible, complete
      this operation by finding Azibelle Spavin and execute her. Bring me her
      head and return me my seal and you shall be rewarded.<br>
      <br>
      Zone into Qeynos Aquaducts.<br>
      <br>
      The investigator was at 951, 30 laying upon the ground.<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'Hail, an investigator'<br>
      <br>
      an investigator coughs and struggles to move. 'There were. . . too many .
      . . too strong.'<br>
      <br>
      Give the investigator the seal from Vegalys.<br>
      <br>
      an investigator says 'Vegalys sent you. I'm done for. Guard Helminth found
      a false wall. We stepped through it. We were ambushed. I didn't see where
      Helminth went. He disappeared. I knew we were overwhelmed. I ran and
      feigned death but I knew [it was too late].<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'it was too late'<br>
      <br>
      investigator gasps clutching a wound and says, 'Their magic was too
      powerful. Necromancers. Undead. Cursed knights of an unholy god. They left
      when they thought I was dead. But even now their curses sap the last of my
      life. I made it as far as I could. If Helminth lives, tell him [I am
      dead]. Please complete the mission. Bring this Azibelle to justice. Avenge
      me.'<br>
      <br>
      Guard Helminth then spawns at 376, -49. This is just before the 4 spectres
      outside of the necromancer guild.<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'Hail, Guard Helminth'<br>
      <br>
      Guard Helminth says 'Who are you and what are you doing here? This place
      is not safe. You are to leave here immediately! You do not belong here!<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'vegalys sent me'<br>
      <br>
      I forgot to try the message from the investigator for Guard Helminth
      (&quot;I am dead&quot;). So I am not sure what response I would have
      received with that.<br>
      <br>
      Guard Helminth says 'So Vegalys sent you to check on our progress then? I
      don't believe you. Prove it!<br>
      <br>
      Give Guard Helminth Vegalys seal. You get the seal back and he responds
      with:<br>
      <br>
      Guard Helminth says 'Well, well! Vegalys did send you after all. Are you
      [ready to complete the mission]? I am certain I know where Azibelle is
      hiding.<br>
      <br>
      You say, 'I am ready to complete the mission'<br>
      <br>
      At this point, Guard Helminth respawns as Corrupt Guard Helminth. Also
      directly behind him a necromancer spawned. Both agro. A few seconds later
      a rotting sentry spawned next to me. All 3 hit in the 70 - 80's range.
      Rotting sentry did harm touch me for 351 points of damage. These guys
      wern't too bad to take down with a 55th mage and 52nd druid. Corrupt Guard
      Helminth was blue at 52nd but the other two were green.<br>
      <br>
      Once Corrupt Guard Helminth was killed, Azibelle Spavin was found on
      track.<br>
      <br>
      Azibelle was found at 439, -264 which is just past the 4 spectres that are
      outside the necromancer guild. She did not respond to hails. Proceeded to
      attack her (did find that I could pull her past the spectres without the
      spectres agroing). She is a shadowknight and was blue to 55th and 52nd.<br>
      <br>
      Loot the &quot;Head of Azibelle Spavin&quot;.<br>
      <br>
      Return to Vegalys Keldrane and turn in the seal and head.<br>
      <br>
      Vegalys Keldrane says 'Good work Meistoff ! So Guard Helminth was corrupt?
      So crafty are these black hearted souls that they can fool even the
      righteous Kane Bayle himself! I'm sure he will be saddened to hear of
      this. I too am saddenned by the loss of one of my best investigators. At
      least we've served justice this day by sending Azibelle Spavin to her dark
      master. May she rot with her god. Take this Badge of Honor and wear it
      with pride and distinction.<br>
      <br>
      Receive &quot;Qeynos Badge of Honor&quot;</span></font></p>
