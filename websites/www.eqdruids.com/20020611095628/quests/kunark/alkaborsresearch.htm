<p align="center"><b><font size="5">Al'Kabor's Research</font></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Verdana">You say, 'Hail, Realla 
Segoan' <br>
<br>
Realla Segoan says 'Greetings, Deedee . I am Realla Segoan from the city of 
Erudin. I cannot spend time chatting with you now. I have [official tasks] to 
perform. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what official tasks' <br>
<br>
Realla Segoan says 'I have been sent to this continent by the High Council of 
Erudin to find information about the disappearance of [Al'Kabor]. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what al'kabor' <br>
<br>
Realla Segoan says 'Al'Kabor is believed to be the most powerful living wizard 
on Norrath. In addition, he is also one of Erudin's oldest citizens. The High 
Council is very interested in receiving information about his disappearance. So 
far, from the [reports] that I have collected, there appears to have been a 
[troublemaking gnome] involved. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what reports' <br>
<br>
Realla Segoan says 'I have received many reports regarding the disappearance. 
Adventurers upon this continent have reported sightings of some of Al'Kabor's 
[missing research notes]. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what Missing research notes' <br>
<br>
Realla Segoan says 'It appears that through his travels, the great wizard has 
misplaced some of his research notes. Perhaps if I can find someone to [help 
collect the research notes], the High Council may be able to determine what 
caused Al'Kabor's disappearance. However, only those who truly know the path the 
great wizard's research has taken him will know where to find the missing 
research notes. <br>
<br>
You say, 'i will help collect the research notes' <br>
<br>
Realla Segoan says 'Excellent! Take this Research Binder and fill it with the 
research notes when you find them. Once it is filled, seal it and take it to 
Noilgin Mindtune here at the outpost, so that he may deliver it to Erudin. Be 
forewarned though, it will be a dangerous path to follow. Most likely, the 
research notes have fallen into possession of some very dangerous beings. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what troublemaking gnome' <br>
<br>
Realla Segoan says 'Yes, a gnome. I have received reports that the gnomish 
wizard, Ognit Eznertob, was near Al'Kabor when he disappeared. I have attempted 
to contact him about it, however, he seems to be avoiding me and the city of 
Erudin. This is not the first time that this gnome has caused trouble for the 
Erudites. He was arrested a while back for tampering with hatch in the Hole, 
releasing evil denizens from the Underfoot. If he is responsible for the 
disappearance, great lengths will be taken to assure the citizens of Erudin that 
the gnome will no longer be trouble for them. <br>
<br>
Collect Six notes. <br>
