  <b><font face="Arial">After completing the Saving Tanik Quest, say 'What can I 
  do to further advance my reputation with the coldain?' <br>
  <br>
  Loremaster Borannin says 'Thank Brell you're here. I was about to send one of 
  my Lorekeepers looking for you. It appears that the information Tanik acquired 
  is most perilous indeed. The Dain has called an emergency session of the 
  council and I must attend. We don't have the luxury of waiting for an 
  appropriate task to arise, you must advance as soon as possible. 
  Unfortunately, I have neither the time, nor the components to fashion the next 
  few shawls for you. Ask Rexx Frostweaver about the prayer shawl and follow his 
  direction carefully. <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'Hail Rexx Frostweaver' <br>
  <br>
  Rexx Frostweaver says 'Hmmm, ye be one o them offlanders, don't ye? I've heard 
  some strange tales o yer kind so don't be tryin' any funny business with me. I 
  know the value of a platinum piece and I'll not get cheated by yer foreign 
  coin. <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'I am here for the next prayer shawl.' <br>
  <br>
  Rexx Frostweaver says 'Gather five strands of crystalline silk thread and 
  combine them in a sewing kit to make a crystalline silk fiber. Take this 
  container and combine a glowing shardworm bile with three of the fibers to 
  form a piece of glowing crystalline silk. Five pieces of glowing crystalline 
  silk sewn to your fur-lined shawl will yield a beautiful silk shawl. Become a 
  master in the art of tailoring before risking all you've worked for and be 
  sure to let me inspect your work when it's complete. <br>
  <br>
  The thread drops from spiders in Velketor's Labyrinth and the shardwurm bile 
  drops from Shardwurms in the Great Divide.</font></b><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">

  <b><font face="Arial">The shardwurm biles drop off &quot;glowing&quot; shardwurms.&nbsp; 
  Turn your particle effects up full, and look for glowing shardwurms.&nbsp; 
  They are more noticeable at night.&nbsp; They are still a rare spawn, so keep 
  killing shardwurms, but eventually they will spawn.</font></b><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <b><font face="Arial">Combine your fur-lined prayer shawl with the 5 pieces of 
  glowing crystalline silk and if you are successful you will have the silk 
  shawl.</font></b><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
