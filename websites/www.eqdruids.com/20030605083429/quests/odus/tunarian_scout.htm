  <font face="Arial">You say, 'Hail, a Tunarian scout'<br>
  <br>
  a Tunarian scout says 'What a [sad] day no?'<br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what sad'<br>
  <br>
  a Tunarian scout says 'Why is it sad? Mother Tunare has blessed nature with 
  many beautiful things, and Innoruuk takes it upon himself to desecrate such 
  beauty with the creation of [abominations] to the very senses. Creatures 
  created, mind you, in his very image. These foul beings slither about and do 
  his bidding, destroying and enslaving, all the while mocking the beauty of 
  creation. It makes me ill to think upon it.'<br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what abominations'<br>
  <br>
  a Tunarian scout says 'I have heard them referred to as Luggalds. They reside 
  upon the blasted island of Broken Skull Rock. I was just now watching the seas 
  to see perhaps if there was any word from our last scout we sent 
  investigating. Unfortunately it has been many weeks and I fear that something 
  has happened to him. Such is too often the fate of truly brave scouts, to 
  disappear and simply never discover their fate. [Fate and mortality] are not 
  why I am here this day, however.' The elf shifts his weight a bit and turns 
  back to the sea, seeming to forget you are there.'<br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what fate and mortality'<br>
  <br>
  a Tunarian scout says 'Fate, mortality, idle concepts that do not highlight my 
  purpose. I am here for honor, and for Mother Tunare. Should our scout not turn 
  up in a few days time I will need to go in his place and leave the coastline 
  rather unprotected. Scouts are so few in numbers these days, there are too 
  many who would overlook such a post in lieu of grandeur and riches. We can 
  always use more good [help].'<br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what help'<br>
  <br>
  a Tunarian scout glances at you sharply, taking both eyes from the sea for the 
  first time. 'Perhaps then you can. The Scouts of Tunare have taken it upon 
  ourselves to learn as much as we can about these Luggalds so that they may be 
  destroyed. It is a mission of utmost danger, as you will be in unfamiliar land 
  and surrounded by enemies on all sides. We have been slaying the Luggalds in 
  batches and ferrying back their organs and remains to study. Thin the 
  population a bit whilst we study' The scout smirks and turns back to the 
  water. 'If you really wish to do this, travel to Broken Skull Rock and slay 
  the Luggalds. Bring me back four carcasses, or evidence thereof. Should the 
  evidence prove enlightening perhaps our leader will have a reward for you, of 
  course that is dependent on you making it out alive. Good luck.'<br>
  <br>
  This is what I know so far. This guy is at the Butcherblock docks.<br>
  <br>
  </font>Turn in 4 Luggard Parts (Found off Luggards in the Castle in Gunthak, 
  altho probably are a random rare drop off any Luggard)<br>
  <br>
  a Tunarian scout says 'Not bad at all, my friend. I believe these will prove 
  most useful in our studies, and four less abominations to contend with.' He 
  scrawls out some symbols that make no sense at all onto a slip of parchment. 
  'Take this to Tylfon in Kelethin and I believe he may show some gratitude to 
  our cause.''<br>
