  <p align=center><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">Jagged Pine Armor - 
  Leggings</font></b></p><p><font face="Arial">You say, 'I wish to acquire 
  leggings' <br>
  <br>
  Cheyloh Greenwood says 'Very well, Aldreaath. There are two components that 
  you will need to return to me; [Polished Jade Acorns] and [Moss-Threaded 
  Rawhide Leggings]. But procuring those items will not be easy, and I can 
  guarantee that you will plunge yourself into danger. However, you should not 
  fear this for we must often selflessly endanger ourselves to fulfill our 
  ultimate goals -- the protection of the natural world. Through these 
  endeavors, your success will be rewarded by nature's recognition and she shall 
  grant to you the gifts you will need to complete this task before you.'' <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what polished jade acorns?' <br>
  <br>
  Cheyloh Greenwood says 'Every piece of the Armor of the Pine requires a 
  special stone. These stones have been carved into different shapes by our 
  artisans, and each one blessed by our elder warders of the pine. 
  Unfortunately, the introduction of the poachers with the creation of the 
  passageway between the forest and the den of Black burrow has brought us to a 
  loss for these sacred items. The Blackguard family and their henchmen have 
  raided our fort several times, stealing our materials to be sold illegally 
  within the underground market of Norrath. However, the poachers are very 
  limited in their knowledge of this area and our ranger scouts have informed us 
  that [Myraephe the Pure] killed the one who stole the specific stones we 
  need.'' <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'who is Myraephe the pure?' <br>
  <br>
  Cheyloh Greenwood says 'The Hatchling River -- a beautiful waterway jealously 
  protected by the nymph spirits known as Potameides, fuels the lifeblood of 
  this forest. These naiads are beautiful creatures, who at one time were 
  benevolent to us until the development of great cultures and the construction 
  of great cities destroyed much of the nymph kind. The Potameides felt the loss 
  of their sisters and became hostile to all mortals alike, viewing our presence 
  as a threat to their very existence. Myraephe is one of the ancient Potameides 
  and our scouts have said that recently, she wears a necklace made of Polished 
  Stone Acorns. Seek Myraede and retrieve the acorns as you will, my friend -- 
  and know neither regret nor sorrow for your actions as their intentions have 
  been influenced by the threat of the Unkempt Wood to the east. The Potameid 
  spirit will return to protect the river its spirit is bound to, so long as the 
  river itself does not become corrupt.'' <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what are moss threaded rawhide leggings?' <br>
  <br>
  Lerian Wyndrunner says 'Aaaahh. . . I see that you have chosen to embark on 
  the sacred path of the Jaggedpine. No doubt my dearest Cheyloh has sent you, 
  and if she has placed her trust in you and given you the sacred knowledge to 
  embark on this ancient quest, then my services are at your disposal in this 
  cause, my friend. To create the Moss Threaded Rawhide Leggings, you will need 
  to obtain the [needed components] that I will work with to make the 
  leggings.'' <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what are the needed components?' <br>
  <br>
  Lerian Wyndrunner says 'The recipe for the Moss Threaded Rawhide Leggings is 
  very specific, and the materials that I am about to describe to you must be 
  exact for the creation of the Leggings of the Pine to be properly completed. 
  From you, I will need a pair of Ruined Rawhide Leggings and a [Spool of Moss 
  Thread]. The ruined leggings you will likely find in the Shrine of Brell 
  Serilis, located beneath our forest. When the gnolls first arrived in the 
  Jaggedpine, they raided our fort several times and although no lives have yet 
  to be lost specifically to their talons, something of which I give praise and 
  thanks to The Rainkeeper for daily, the gnolls have stolen our supplies from 
  time to time.'' <br>
  You say, 'what is a spool of moss thread?' <br>
  Lerian Wyndrunner says 'This item you will need to use your own hands, 
  patience, and devotion to the natural world to create. A mastery of the skill 
  of weaving -- tailoring -- is very important when attempting to handle such a 
  feat. The items that you must weave to make this enchanted thread are the 
  Shadowjade Moss and Threads of the Hatchling. The Shadowjade Moss you will 
  find as a gift from the Jaggedpine for your services to her. If you search 
  carefully and with selfless patience, she will grant you a perfect specimen 
  suitable for the creation of this item. The Threads of the Hatchling you must 
  acquire from the Potameid Bewilders in the caves located off the Hatchling 
  River. May The Rainkeeper guide you in your quest, my friend, and I look 
  forward to your return.'' <br>
  <br>
  Myraephe the Pure is found in the river near the poacher camp. She is light 
  blue to 60, and immune to root/snare. </font></p><p><font face="Arial">The
