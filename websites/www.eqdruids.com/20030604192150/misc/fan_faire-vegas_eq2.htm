  <font face="Times New Roman" size="6">EQ2 from Fan Faire</font></b></p>
  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">Ok, lets start digging in to this Fan Faire. </font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">There was a TON of EQ2 information given out.&nbsp; Let me 
  tell you something folks, if this game lives up to what we were told and shown 
  it is going to be mindblowing!</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">There was a gaming magazine given out that had a lot of the 
  information in it, but more was said by the developers.&nbsp; I'm going to 
  just hit both at the same time.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">Character creation is going to be much more involved in the 
  fact that your stats will mean much more to your character.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you 
  are a fighter, you will find that a race that has more strength will actually 
  give you bonus' beyond what say a weaker race will.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">There are NO class restrictions by race!&nbsp; Yes, that 
  means you can be an Ogre Druid.&nbsp; That doesn't mean it will be easy to be 
  one, but if you feel the need you can be.&nbsp; The difference will be, that 
  when you hit the point of specializing into a Druid, you will need to find a 
  &quot;trainer&quot; that will teach you the way, and as an Ogre you may have a hard time 
  doing this.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">The initial class archetypes are Fighter, Rogue, Mage, 
  Priest or Tradesperson.&nbsp; From there you will further define your 
  character into a more specialized character.&nbsp; An interesting thing, all 
  archetypes will have the same role, just from different directions.&nbsp; An 
  example would be a fighter can have choices like Crusader or Brawler, then 
  specialize from there.&nbsp; Each specialized class will have a definite 
  advantage on one characteristic over the others, but will also have many of 
  the other abilities within that archetype.&nbsp; </font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">Deaths in EQ2 will be handled MUCH differently.&nbsp; 
  Instead of losing exp, you will be put in experience debt.&nbsp; Those of us 
  that play EQ Online Adventures will know this one.&nbsp; You continue to move 
  forward with experience, but half of the experience goes towards paying off 
  your death &quot;debt&quot;.&nbsp; One major advantage is you will not lose levels when 
  you die this way.&nbsp; Also when you die, you will not have to do a naked run 
  to your corpse.&nbsp; Two options will be available.&nbsp; One you will be 
  able to hover like a ghost over your corpse until rezzed, or you can &quot;take&quot; 
  the death, and lose a level appropriate item from your inventory.&nbsp; They 
  have said definitely that it wouldn't be a rare item, just one that makes you 
  have some cost to the death.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">Pathing is being completely redone, and the bad news is, 
  they will be able to chase you ALL over without losing you :)</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">Spell casting will be basically the same, however you will 
  be able to train in your own &quot;focus effects&quot;.&nbsp; This allows you to 
  basically add damage or power to a spell if you have the required mental 
  abilities.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">Large mobs will all have their own little &quot;pocket&quot; 
  encounters.&nbsp; This means that multiple groups will have access to mobs 
  stopping the monopoly of some groups taking down the mob over and over.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">You will also be able to communicate through serverwide 
  chats with all the servers in EQ.&nbsp; So you should be able to keep in touch 
  from game to game.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">Tradeskills will now be a complete class.&nbsp; You can be 
  a tradeskiller, that will gain experience by their work.&nbsp; And yes, there 
  will be group projects similar to raids for traders to work on.&nbsp; One 
  hugely nice thing, if you hand someone items for them to work their 
  tradeskills on, they actually stay on your person while being worked on.&nbsp; 
  So never a chance of lost items!</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">There will be a payment model announced for those folks 
  playing both EQ and EQ2, but that wont be announced until E3.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">The graphics are just incredible in the game.&nbsp; The 
  shadows are beyond belief, and the models are just fantastic.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">The movements are really nice!&nbsp; The characters have a 
  definite flow to them that is lacking now.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">The minimum requirements right now, is a Pentium 3, 512 
  megs of ram, and a geoforce 3 or higher graphic card.&nbsp; The game will be 
  extremely scaleable, meaning you can turn off lots of options to make the 
  gameplay move very easily on even an older computer.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">These guys are making a really really kick ass game.&nbsp; 
  It is going to just be an amazing game to play.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <font face="Arial">I'm sure there was more that I will remember later, but 
  right now that is the big stuff.&nbsp; Just let me tell you, it was an amazing 
  demo!!</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
