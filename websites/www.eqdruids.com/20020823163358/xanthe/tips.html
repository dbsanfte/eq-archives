Some of the items in these tables are <u>underlined</u>. Any item that is <u>underlined</u> can be made by a trade skill (although sometimes they can also be bought). This is just to let you know if you are going to have to find someone to make a part for you, or if you will have to make something yourself using another trade skill.<p><br> <b><u>Picking up 1 thing from a stack</b></u><br><br> When using items that stack, it can be a pain in the wrist to have to click on the stack, move the little scroll bar, then click ok to pick up 1 item from the stack. To get around this, hold down the Ctrl key and left click on the stack. This will let you pick up just 1 item from the stack, and will save you a lot of time and hassle. Use it often.<p><br> <b><u>Wisdom and Intelligence</b></u><br><br> It is widely accepted that the higher you wisdom or intelligence, the quicker you will skill up, and the better your chance of success when making an item. Pick one, either Wis or Int and max it out as much as you can when doing your trade skills (wis casters will obviously pick wis, and int casters will pick int). Enhancing buffs will also help.<p><br> <b><u>I'm a failure!</b></u><br><br> Well, hopefully not, but it has often been reckoned that there is around about a 5% chance of failure on any combine you may choose to do. Not nice at the higher end of things...<p><br> <b><u>Strength and Smithing</b></u><br><br> Apparently a higher Strength will aid your skill and success in Smithing. Buff up:)<p><br> <b><u>Dexterity and Fletching</b></u><br><br> The same goes for Dexterity and Fletching.<br><br><hr><br><center><a href=index.htm>Back to Main Page</a></center><br><hr><br><center><p></center></body></html>
