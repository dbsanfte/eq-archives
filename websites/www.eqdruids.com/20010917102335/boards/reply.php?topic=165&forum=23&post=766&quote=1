 All,

I know there is a guide for soloing out there which is great, however I want to see if we can get one started for where to get good groups as a druid (primarily for experience).

I hit 43 soloing in OT and now am thinking about SolB but are there safe places I could pick up a group to get a quick bubble of experience at this level ? Perhaps we can get a guide started for where to get in good groups for experience at different levels like the Solo Guide. Thanks

 43 is heaven in the Dreadlands. Alright, it isn't heaven but you can certainly do well. Just leave the wolfform at home. 

Other places to hit for good grouping:
Lower Guk - love it, hate it... it still works pretty well
Sol B - Eh, why not. I hear it is nice but can't say I have spent time there.
Emerald Jungle/CoM - BYoG generally but certainly things to do.
Kaesora - BYoG(s) but nice hunting and good experience.
Eastern Wastes - Ry'Gorr fort is nice... otherwise MOB hp get silly IMHO
Kedge Keep - I hear nothing but praise and absolute condemnation for this place... thanks but Bloodgills gave me my swimming fix for a while.

Heck, there are lots of places in this range I figure.

Enjoy the hunt, packs seem pretty efficient at times.

 Group Guide... just how I did it with Groups:

Human/Druid:

1 to 10: GFay - Normal Orc Hill/Crushbone groups.

10-14 Chessboard in BB

15-17 Dirv Camp in WC

18-20 Oasis

20-39 (Yes, It stunk being here but I learned so much about different classes and became the "resident druid"... HIGH HOLD KEEP ... all your different abilites are used depending on group mix ... it was nice walking into the Keep and getting 5-7 tells to join a group when there are waiting list...


40-44 Rethe Mts Hill Giant groups, good plat, fair exp.

45-51 I gave in to group/partner/solo at the Spirocs, once I did a quad of 4 provens at 49 it was... oh yeah!!!

51-52 Grouping in Burning Woods at Giant Fort.

Gam

p.s. To this day I won't step foot in HH, I wish I knew of other places "then" to group instead of HH, should have left there after getting out of hell lvl 30.

 I took about a year off from playing, so I don't remember pre-25, but since then I did pretty well grouping:

25-low 30's: Gnolls at the SK spires and inside of Paw (Paw is probably a lot better now that the exp modifier has been updated)

Mid 30's: the 4C room in Cazic Thule. If you have a good puller and an enchanter, you can pretty much be constantly fighting.

Unfortunately I pretty much soloed cougars in Iceclad for 37-38, great exp and I made a lot of money from Cougar Claw Earrings while the market was still booming.

And from 39-44 I have made good, steady exp in the Lower Guk dead side. Get in a Magi, Lord, or Frenzy group and watch it roll in, plus all three have phat lewts. Another bonus for LGuk, at least on my server, is there is almost always a 49+ cleric in there, in case you get a bad pull =)

Now I just need to find the perfect spot for 45-50.

 Is this a grouping guide for where you can find pickup groups? Or is it just a guide of where you can take a group to to get exp or loot or whatever? 


If its the pickup group thing, heres some input for the Fennin Ro server(cant remember old old days)....

20-25?Lake Rathe

25-30 Tesch Mas Gnolls/SK

30's cant remember, maybe SK too?

40's DL's, LGuk, CoM, Ryggor Fort in Velious, Crystal Caverns, Burning Woods(maybe).

My memory sucks, and i know there are alot more especialy in early lvls that i'm missing. If i remember any i'll add.

 43 and lookin for a grp? Hit Lower Guk. You can get into Lord /Frenzy for excellent xp, I went from 40-45 in a matter of days there. But if you change your mind and want to solo, then I suggest root/dot'ing in Dreadlands. You can do this all the way up to 55, but I only did it to 53. Excellent xp, hope this helps.

 ok heres what i do usually do with all my new chars.. and i've had a few

2-7 NRO good newbie zone, really good. Beetles and spiderlings make good crap stuff until 5, at 5 head out onto the desert to kill white and blue Orc Raiders and jackals. 

8-10 Orc Groups in East Commonlands... good exp and some of the best loot around for this level

10-13 i go to Nro and join derv groups... 2 or 3 should suffice, dont let those idiots tell you that 6 people is good for orc groups... and dont stay till 17 that would take way to long

13-15 Oasis of Marr, stay in orc groups there, there is almost always only 1 other group there even in peak hours, and there are more than enough orc to pull. Watch out for the "A" orc because if he gets a hold on you and you dont have sow, kiss your ass goodbye (unless Melee).

15-20 I am currently in Highpass, good exp at orcs there and a nice pack if you win the roll. I recommend that what you do is damage shield then tank(s) and throw a few nukes in if you dont have a wizard. Most of the time you will be a downtime healer so your group members wont mind if you are gone for a little bit, just dont abuse that privelage. 

16-24 if you really want you can go to Aviak Guards in Lake Rathe for these levels, after 20 its slower than before but its still good exp, loots pretty bad, 2-8 gold and rusty weapons, OCCASIONALLY you might get bronze but i've only gotten about 6 bronze weapons from them and my necro spent 17-21 there. 

Well heres what i've gotten to so far. Good? No? tell me i would really like to know!

 I am very much into the pro-grouping scene mainly because I enjoy meeting new people and making friends.
I am not the seasoned veteran that many of you are this is my first character and I have only been on EQ for a little over 2 months now but here was my strategic plan that shot me through the levels:

1-8 soloed/grouped orcs in GFay

8-10 moved to EC and grouped orcs and lions etc.

10-18 moved to Oasis grouped crocs/dervs/orcs

18-24 went to Lake of Ill Omen to group Sarnaks (this was the fastest I leveled and I could have stayed until lvl 30 but I needed to find cash)

24-27 grouped mammoths in Everfrost for some phat lewt

27-current lvl of 29 grouping giants in Frontier Mountains (phat lewt here too). 

My plan is to hit 30 then probably join some friends in Rathe MTs or move to Overthere for a few. We'll see. In all the places I mentioned there was ALWAYS an available group looking for members I had no problems at all finding groups. GOod luck and happy hunting.

 With my 45 druid I did the following:
1-6 solo in Misty
6-10 grouped in Misty and killed anything blue
10-14 Orc and Derv Camps
14-20 EK, Birds in SK, A bit of High Hold and High Keep, and Gnolls in SK(Probably couldn't do till 23+ now with the crowding)
20-30 Gnolls, Birds, Paw, Bit of Lower Guk w/ high level friends at 27-30(normal level for LGuk is 35+)
30-35 Paw, LGuk
35-40 LGuk, SolB, and a bit of soloing Dwarves
40-44 Playing time dropped so I did alot solo but also threw in LGuk and SolB
44-45 Spent all my time in Karnors with friends(again won't be able to do normally till 49+)

I also did many other dungeons for fun every once in a while. I hunted in Dalnir, Droga, Kaesora(tagged along w/ 50+ guildmates and had a great time not to mention got half a level in 2 hours due to it all being green to them.) and I am sure some other strange places. I was lucky because I had a great guild so I got to do all sorts of fun things like go on Dragon raids at 40 so I hunted where ever I could find a spot regardless of level.

 Look for higher level groups is the secret, healers can sneak into high level groups and get kickass xp as primary healer with a chanter or even back up healer. But, this is how i did it up to about 44-45 with my druid and a friends druid.

1-5 Newbie Zone
5-9 East Commonlands Orcs *9 = new healing spell*
9-14 Various Derv camps *14th lvl xp really starts to slow*
14-19 or 20 Highpass Orc Group *14 can be a bit low to get in a group, but i managed to sneak in.
19 ahh the magic level ports...
Ports is why i love my druid and wizar, if u cant find a group in one area port to another side of Norrath and try there)

20-34ish I have heard Highkeep which works but gets boring for about 14 lvls
20-34ish South Karana avaiks at lower end levels and then get in a spire group, and maybe after 24 look inside Paw for a back up healer job.
29-34 Dalnir This place is great xp (Kunark Bonus, Dungeon Bonus and full group bonus if u have one), and the only people that are usually there are farmers camping the Lumpy Goo and such(fighting batons). So, grab a few guildies and head down there.
34-40ish Overthere is awesome xp for this area.
40-45ish Dreadlands
Post 45- not sure yet neither me or my friend have gotten that high yet

PS Not to sure about places in Velious yet...havent been there much.

Oh, and if u really dont want fast xp in between lvls go hunt HGs 29-34, by the time u walk out of those levels u will either be a well equipped druid, or a rich one. Also if u are looking for money this is a great place to offer bank services. Pick up a bunch of plat from the bank and port to Feerrott run to Rathe and offer to bank some people. Trade plat for item/gold/silver/copper and then port to a bank. Usually u can make quite a bit doing this.

 I hope this doesn't sound like flame bait, but EQ has been out 2 years now. A little late for a druid grouping guide if you ask me. Getting a group really depends on demand in the zone. My personal opinion, the best druid for a group is a druid that knows how to solo. And I'm not talking about wimpy soloing single static spawns. If you can single pull with harmony well, park extra mobs with root, or kite multiple mobs then you're going to rock in a group, especially if that group doesn't have someone who can handle crowd control. Just my two coppers.

 I have to disagree. Most soloer's will never learn all the skills needed for a group. The only way to pick them up is to start grouping early and keep on grouping. There are so many little tricks that you can only use once in a while and in a group that they are hard to explain and teach. Such as how some mobs will agro you while sitting but not while standing. You cannot do this ungrouped, you need more than one person to agro it, yourself and 1 other. Timing for this only comes with experience. Basically it is a way to get a fear like effect without fear. It can be hard to do if you and the others grouped with have not done it before, but once you learn it and figure out the kinks it is pretty nice. There are so many tricks of the trade that can only be learned while grouping that I HIGHLY suggest that everyone group often. Soloing is good for when you only have an hour or 2 and don't want to go through the trouble of finding a group wasting 1/2 your time. However when you have more time group. If you every want to go on any type of raid and be successful this is where it starts. The little group of level 10's figuring out how to work best with the classes they have.

 Places to group for xp at the higher levels (I tend to bounce around a bunch depending on whats available)

Bettween 48 and 52 I've gotten good xp in the Hole, Karnors, Sebilis, Kael, and Howling Stones.

Howling Stones is great, get a rogue to open the door, cleric, tank, bard or enc, you (druid), and a mage for not stop pull action xp :)

 If you guys are still working on making a guide, I have some suggestions of things I would like to see at least.

In my little itty bitty experience with being a druid, it seems like I always get stuck with having to heal and occassionally get to use my harmony abilities as well. I know we can blast them with our spells, but does anyone ever get a chance to do that in a group? Maybe it's just what my luck is whenever I get in a group, but 9 times out of 10 I end up being healer for the group. It's nice being able to heal people, but sometimes it just gets really boring.

So, I guess my point is to ask what do other people do when they're in a group and for what other purposes can we be used? (BTW, I do snare as well when I get a chance. Sometimes the mobs die faster than I can snare, though. ^^;)

 Well, a large part of the point of playing a druid is their versatility, so what you do in a group should absolutely vary based on the other classes' capabilities. The four things that will always stay constant are: regeneration/chloroplast/regrowth, damage shielding, snaring, and saving 300 mana for that evac spell.

In a post-50 group that has both a cleric and an enchanter, my mana gets used on regen, thorns, snaring, DoTing, and debuffing (in about that priority order, though I always snare).

In a group that has no cleric, I heal, regen, thorn, and snare.

In a group that has no crowd control (enchanter/bard/necro), I do a lot of parking, where when two mobs are pulled, you root one a little distance away so it can't beat on you. I also do regen, thorns, and snare, but I try to keep my aggro pretty low otherwise so that hopefully only the mob that I'm trying to keep parked is aggro on me.

 There are a couple of grouping guides on EQDruids. They need updating so maybe someone can start with them and refresh them in light of Kunark and Velious.

 *nod* I guess my situation is that I haven't been in many groups where there were other healers. So from what I understand at this point, it's a matter of knowing your spells, and knowing your group. I always forget that I have those thorny spells, too. 
Last night I took the advice I read on this message board and went to Highpass and while at first I was healer, we later got a shaman and cleric into the group as well and I was finally able to use a variety of my spells for the first time in a group! I healed, blasted, DoT'd, and of course, snared. Next time I'll know to bring up my shield as well.
I guess the main point then, as I imagine is the main point of EQ altogether, is to always try to maintain a well rounded group in order to have the best game play! ^_^

 Hehe, well, "those thorny spells" are one of the trademarks of the druid class and they are absolutely worth using in almost any context. Let's look at it for a second.

At level 17 you're still using Shield of Thistles, which at 17 should be a 6 point damage to the mob every time it hits something. I have no idea how many times the mob is going to hit your tank, but let's say it's 20 ... sounds reasonable to me. Then for 40 mana, you're doing 6 x 20 = 120 damage. (3 damage per mana point.)

Compare that to Ignite, which is 30 mana for 37 damage (barely more than 1 damage per mana point) ... and remember that the thorns, unlike Ignite, are unresistable ... and you can see why damage shields are so powerful. The only thing that's required is that your group be smart enough to be able to keep the mob on the tank the entire time.

 I try to avoid soloing whenver possible. I do it sometimes when I can't get a group, but I have grouped pretty much since level 8. Here is what I did. I am a wood elf so adjust the first few levels to a newbie zone near you:

1-5 Greater Fay-Wasps, Bats, Decaying Skellys, Orc Pawns, Pixie tricksters. Cloth armor and better weaponry drops off Orc pawns and skellys respectivly. 

5-15-CRUSHBONE! IMO the best place to go at this level. The zone is close and there are rather weak MOBS that spawn inside the cave adjacent to the zone. I soloed till level 8 and got into my first group. 

15-19 Oasis-Crocs and Orcs-Orcs are the best for loot as crocs drop basicaly nothing.

19-24 Aviak Village in SK-Good group exp here and loot is good to, PLUS you don't take a faction hit with the Aviaks. That means if you are indifferent to them you can kill 1000 of them and still be indifferent. Nice plus at this level since if Avocets aggroed there would be a lot of death. 

24-30-Split Paw Gnolls-Started outside with the spawns by the pillars. Again, good exp and loot with a good group. Waited a few levels and ventured into Paw itself. DANGEROUS there as trains can dearail you in a hurry. Good group skills here are a must. 

30-34-Cazac Thule-Again..awesome exp and loot but very dangerous and prone to LARGE trains. I camped the 4C Area, throne room, the Avitar once or twice, alligators and the silver temple...all good areas with a good group. 

34-present-SOL B! Very good exp here and loot is still pretty good. From what I have been told you can stay in this area past 50 since there are mobs that give exp even to those levels. 

I am currently level 44..almost 45 and group about 90% of the time. I solo only when I can't get a group or if Im on a list and am waiting for my turn. I went to Karnors Castle the other night and that is a good place for loot as a lot of magical items, including some Elder Spiritist gear, falls. Man, those Drollvargs are scary..hehe

Anyway, thats my journey up until the present time. Hope this helps.

Truth be told, if you wanna be a druid in a group, getting one can be hard, because most druids Kite and solo, and thuse there is a whole culture around being in a group. What people expect of you, and what you should do. 

Sadly, even tho I am a druid, Normally, I am let down by my fellow druids when it comes to hunting, for the most part, they are not up on their spells, and not in constarnt check of what they can do for the group as a whole.

The only real advice I can give any Druid in the game is stay on top of your spells, and keep your eyes open. For the most part, druids are invited in the group for 1 of 2 reasions, to heal, or to buff (SoW). Too many times, I have hunetd with druids that just SIT there, like they are waiting to be told what to do, and sadly, if you have a good group, they DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO TELL YOU WHAT TO DO ! they Expect you KNOW what you are doing. I mean, you can't expect a 45th level warrior to tell you how to play a druid, your supposed to know this. 

Tho, I have met some really good group druids, but they are the rare one's, and even tho you group, that does not mean you group good. Grouping is an Art form, and the group hunt is a tricky as kiting, if not , harder to do, and more to watch out for. 

Just my two bits.

 Firstly, you can learn to group at higher levels even if you solo for a lot of your levels. It is not rocket science to be a good druid in a group. Yes you need to learn about controlling aggro, when to heal , when not to sit, not dotting when chanter mezzing etc. etc. but it aint that hard !
Selectively our spells can help (regrowth,buffs, debuffing, thorns et all), but basically in a higher level group in KC , Seb and Charasis your defining role will be snare (runners are death in a dungeon) back up heal and evac (when the brown stuff hits the fan). 
Boring but thats about it ! 
Get these basics right and you will get groups

 Many times I have joined a pick-up group that already has a druid. Let me rephrase that......

Many times I have joined a pick-up group that has a BAD druid.

It usually goes like this. I join and do a lvl check. The druid is my level or extremely close. Well, I ask "who needs STR?" 3 tanks say "Me!". I then ask, "who wants wolf form?" Everyone cheers "ME, ME, ME!" I then cast group regen and get a thanks from the cleric. I scratch my head and wonder....what the hell has this druid been doing in this fricking group?!? *boggle*

Fill the slots guys...if shaman is there, but no cleric, skin instead of STR. If you have both a shaman and a cleric, keep sow/wolf up, regen, dmg sheild the main, snare, and DD your freaking brains out. I cannot comprehend how a druid can say they do not have a place in a group. Teach others that you are a bad-ass, damage dealing, DoTing, buffing, debuffing, and healing MACHINE!

Opps...guess this was rant-ish. Just had to vent. Down with Dr00ds.

 I agree with Klaymoore. Grouping is not difficult and the difficulty is often over-exaggerated. I remember when i was lower lvl and always would get advice to group early and often so i can become a good grouper. That is false. What you do early in groups from say lvl 1-20 is going to be totally different than what you do from say 30-50. Since all classes get new spells, as well as yourself and your role will change. When your higher lvl, you will rarely be main healer or have the heealing ability you did at lower lvls. You will have to learn to work with mezz and many other spells other classes get that they didnt have in the early lvls. The intervals are alot more broken up than my hypothetical lvl scenario so dont take that literally.

I group and solo regularly, so i'm not biased. Imo you should do both, that way you will learn skills that the other doesnt teach you. For example, if you group the whole time you will never learn to pull since your tank will probly do most of the pulling. You will be asked to pull often at higher lvls since we have tracking ability. I pull often in Skyfire and TT, pulling is a skill in itself since what makes a good puller is the ability to pull mobs at a steady pace for the group without add's, as well as rares when they show up. If you solo the whole time you wont learn to work with mezz which is very important to learn. Both have skills you should learn, which will set you that much more apart(better) from the Druid that only did one of the two their whole careers. We're judged in comparison to one another so the term 'good' is relative to the next Druid. 

So even though you will hear 'group early and often so you can be a good grouper', that is not accurate and imo misleading. People want you to group, Verant wants you to group, but the reality of the situation is grouping is not difficult to learn, and should take you a few weeks at most to learn the nuances of grouping. Take advantage of the fact that you as a Druid can solo, and remember that other classes resent that because they cant. Again, do both and you'll be a much more well-rounded Druid compared to the Druid that does only one thing the whole time.
