  <font face="Arial">This quest begins in the Plane of Knowledge on the ‘good’ 
  side. At one of the pools you will find Tratlan Jowyr and Wicas Adaolath.<br>
  <br>
  You say, 'Hail, Tratlan Jowyr' <br>
  <br>
  Tratlan Jowyr looks deeply into the pool in front of him, 'Well darn it! I 
  still can't see anything in this blasted [pool], can you Wicas?'<br>
  <br>
  Wicas Adaolath says 'Nothing at all. Do you think that he led us astray?' <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'What pool?' <br>
  <br>
  Tratlan Jowyr glances up at you like he just noticed your presence, 'This 
  pool. There is supposed to be strong [magic] in it.' <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'What magic?' <br>
  <br>
  Tratlan Jowyr says 'Scrying magic. These pools can supposedly glance into all 
  of the knowledge past, present, and future.' <br>
  <br>
  Wicas Adaolath says 'I think we should just do what [Tarerd] wants us to do.'
  <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'Who tarerd?' <br>
  <br>
  Wicas Adaolath says 'Tarerd is the one who told us about these pools. He 
  wanted us to kill some sort of lizards for him, but we have neither the time 
  nor energy for such adventures. Perhaps you can get some information about the 
  pools from him.'<br>
  <br>
  Tarerd Gahar is at another nearby pool. <br>
  <br>
  Hail, Tarerd Gahar' <br>
  <br>
  Tarerd Gahar says 'I'm sorry Syfoo, I have neither the time nor the patience 
  to chat right now.' <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'What pool?' <br>
  <br>
  Tarerd Gahar says 'Oh Tatlan and Wicas sent you did they? I'll tell you what I 
  told them, nothing is free. If you want to know about the pools then I need 
  something [from you] first.'<br>
  <br>
  You say, 'What from me?' <br>
  <br>
  Tarerd Gahar says 'I'm sure it'll be easy for an adventurer as you. I am 
  working on a potion, and I cannot currently travel to gather my last 
  component. If you could bring me the blood of a Sarnak I'd be willing to share 
  what I know.'<br>
  <br>
  Sarnak blood is of course a random drop from nearly any sarnak, you can 
  probably find one at a merchant for sale. <br>
  <br>
  When you have it give it to Tarerd Gahar. <br>
  <br>
  Tarerd Gahar says 'Ahh this is exactly what I was looking for. All the 
  information I've gathered from these pools has come from Myrist. Thiran will 
  give you the book I used as a reference. Give him this note so he knows I sent 
  you'<br>
  <br>
  Thiran is a Vicar he’s on the first basement floor of the basement (go down 
  one lvl when you enter. <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'Hail, Vicar Thiran' <br>
  <br>
  Vicar Thiran says 'A dark day to you, Syfoo. New Tanaan has opened its arms to 
  all of Norrath's travelers and scholars alike -- though still I doubt most are 
  worthy of our infinite and unsurpassed knowledge. In any case, we all must 
  uphold the laws of our city, else we become as debased and pathetic as the 
  secular, warring cultures of the material universe. You will find that, 
  despite the medium of our birth or the shadow of faith in our hearts, we are 
  all equally tolerant of each being to approach us. Though I myself am no 
  stranger to the duties of a mentor, I do not think that at this juncture, I 
  would provide any useful assistance to any not of the many clergies associated 
  with the pantheon. If you do indeed serve one of the gods of Nature and 
  Influence, then my services may not prove a waste of our collective time. 
  Search my inventory at your will, and purchase what you wish should you find 
  anything of use to you at this point in your life of service.'<br>
  <br>
  Give him the note: <br>
  <br>
  Vicar Thiran quickly reads the note, and says 'Tarerd wants me to give you 
  that book? I thought he wanted me to keep it secret. Well no matter.' Thiran 
  rummages through the books in front of him. 'Well this is unfortunate. It 
  looks like I loaned my friend the incorrect book. I'm not sure where he's gone 
  off to, here is the book he was looking for. If you happen to run into Jeren 
  Manri anywhere, he'll probably exchange this book for the book on the scrying 
  pools.'<br>
  <br>
  Thiran gives you a book “Goblins and their religion”. This is of course the 
  only clue to where Jeren Manri is, can you guess where?<br>
  <br>
  Jeren Manri is in the Temple of Droga. His loc is 473.95, 1747, -252. </font>
  </b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial">He is in a very tiny room with fake 
  walls on each end. <br>
  <br>
  Hail, Jeren Manri' <br>
  <br>
  Jeren Manri says 'Shhh, be quiet! The goblins may hear you.' <br>
  <br>
  Give him the book that Thiran gave you: <br>
  <br>
  Jeren Manri says 'Oh! Thank you, I assume this means that Thiran sent you. I 
  ran off with the incorrect book without thinking to check. Would you be kind 
  enough to return this to him?'<br>
  <br>
  You actually do not return it to Thiran, the book has 5 charges of bind sight, 
  but don’t panic, that’s not the end.</font></b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial">&nbsp;Go back to the very first guy 
  you talked to, Tratlan Jowyr back in Plane of Knowledge, Good Side. Give him 
  the book:<br>
  <br>
  Tratlan Jowyr leafs quickly through the book. 'Thank you, it will take quite 
  some time to go through all the information here. Here is a little something 
  for your troubles.'<br>
  <br>
  You gain party experience!!</font></b></p>
