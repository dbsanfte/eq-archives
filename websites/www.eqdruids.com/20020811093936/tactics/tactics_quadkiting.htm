Often, quad kiting requires a druid's entire mana pool, and will result in significant downtime. However, the experience gained is extraordinary.</p><p>Mana-free items, such as the <a href=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=519>Luminescent Staff</a> can greatly reduce the amount of mana used per quad.</p><p>The zone and type of target can also affect your success in quad kiting. Some zones have too many wandering mobs. Some mobs have too many hitpoints, or have a high magic resistance. For information about recommended zones and targets, click <a href=http://pub50.ezboard.com/feqdruids24038frm11.showMessage?topicID=125.topic>here</a>.</p><p>Quad Kiting can technically begin at level 5, using the spell <b>Invoke Lightning</b>. However, it is recommended that you wait until you obtain <b>Lightning Strike</b> at level 34 (or later) to begin quad kiting. By then, your mana pool is much larger, and you have the use of <b>Ensnare</b> at level 29.</p><p>The following AoE spells can be used in quad kiting:<center><table border=0 width=400><tr><td bgcolor=#000000><font face=Arial color=FFFFFF size=2><b>Spell Name</td><td align=center bgcolor=#000000><font face=Arial color=FFFFFF size=2><b>Damage</td><td bgcolor=#000000><font face=Arial color=FFFFFF size=2><b>Spell Level</td><td align=right bgcolor=#000000><font face=Arial color=FFFFFF size=2><b>Cast Time</td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33CC33><td><font face=Arial size=2>Invoke Lightning</td><td align=center><font face=Arial size=2>21 - 25</td><td><font face=Arial size=2>Level 5</td><td align=right><font face=Arial size=2>2.5 sec</td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td><font face=Arial size=2>Lightning Strike</td><td align=center><font face=Arial size=2>173 - 185</td><td><font face=Arial size=2>Level 34</td><td align=right><font face=Arial size=2>4.5 sec</td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33CC33><td><font face=Arial size=2>Lightning Blast</td><td align=center><font face=Arial size=2>477</td><td><font face=Arial size=2>Level 49</td><td align=right><font face=Arial size=2>6.1 sec</td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td><font face=Arial size=2>Fist of Karana</td><td align=center><font face=Arial size=2>812</td><td><font face=Arial size=2>Level 58</td><td align=right><font face=Arial size=2>6.0 sec</td></tr></table><p><b>Note:</b> All spells are outdoor-only.

This is rather simple to do with a little bit of practice. Here are some general tips for grouping mobs:</p><center><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td><font face=Arial size=2>Assuming the targets are side by side, harmony them and pull one with snare. Get him far enough away from the other so you can go back to the one still sitting there and then pull him with snare. Repeat this for all four targets, then run circles around them until they are sufficiently grouped together, and kite away.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><font face=Arial size=2>Say you have a target at 9:00 and 3:00. Get within casting distance of both if possible. Target the first and pull with snare. Then turn and do the same with the second. As they advance on you, slowly walk backwards keeping them and yourself in a &quot;V&quot; type formation. With them at the tips of the &quot;V&quot; and you at the intersection where the lines meet. As they draw closer to you they will close the distance between themselves. Once they are close enough together, kite away.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><font face=Arial size=2>This is another good way. Especially for those who may not have enough mana to kite more than one mob efficiently. (Best used with the &quot;V&quot; formation example above) Once you have meditated to full, cast regenerate on yourself. Then med back up to full mana. Then cast your second damage shield on yourself, then either med to full again, or pull if you are ready. Let all targets close in on you and hit you a couple of times. This has 2 advantages: <ul><li>Gets both targets side by side. <li>Does a little bit of damage to each that may save you having to cast a last DD spell on them.</ul></td></tr></table></center><p>There are lots of other ways to do this.</p><p>Most often, you will have to go find a target, and snare it. Then find another target that runs at the same speed, and snare that one. Repeat until you have four targets snared. Run away from the targets and either run in Y pattern, or encircle them until you have them bunched up tight (they should almost look like one target). Then run a safe distance from them and cast your best area affect spell. Continue to cast it until they are dead.</p><p>You should experiment and find whatever method works best for you.</p><p align=left><a href=#Contents><font face Arial size=2>Back To Top</font></a></p><a name=Add><p><u>Some things to keep in mind using this method:</u></p></a><center><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td><font face=Arial size=2><b>Always keep the targets close together.</b> IF they get separated during the fight, stand directly in the center of the 2 and slowly back away as the get closer. this will draw them back together. If you are kiting more than 2 and this happens, draw 2 of them together, the repeat the process above to get the 3rd back in the group.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><font face=Arial size=2><b>Targets need to run at the same speed when snared.</b> This makes it easy to keep them grouped together.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><font face=Arial size=2>Lightning Strike takes a lot of mana to cast, and is not really mana efficient for the damage it does. <b>For best mana / damage efficiency you will need 3 or more targets.</b></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><font face=Arial size=2>Med a little early on in the kite if you think you will need it later on. It is easier to med a bit with 4 snared mobs than to be running and wishing you had enough mana to resnare or blast that last mob that resisted your AoE's.<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><font face=Arial size=2><b>Before you get all gung ho and go trying to kill 4 mobs at once, try this out on a single target first.</b> See how much mana it will take you to kill it, and how much you have left over. IF you have to med to much during the battle, it might be best to wait for your next lvl, or until you get another good WIS increasing item.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><font face=Arial size=2><b>Keep in mind that just because you can kill 2 at a time, does not mean that you can take 3 or 4 effectively.</b> Because of the low damage of the spell, it takes longer to kill, and you will most probably have to resnare each target during battle. (I usually do this at 1/2 mana just to be safe) You also have to factor in resists. If more than 1 target resists a large portion of the damage, or resists a blast completely, this could lead to problems when going to finish them off.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><font face=Arial size=2>To reduce the amount of downtime, <b>keep self-buffs to a minimum</b>.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><font face=Arial size=2><b>Be considerate of other people.</b> Yes you can solo. Yes, you are a well oiled machine. Yes you are an exp machine. BUT do not step on any other people/groups to quad. I mean, do not go to the snow cougar camp and grab your 4 mobs and run away if there are 75 other people there camping snow cougars. Most times there are other places to go, and after all , we are the masters of travel.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><font face=Arial size=2><b>This style of kiting is not very suitable for Tag Team kiting.</b> It's efficiency is based on keeping the targets together. With someone helping you or healing you in battle, this may distract one of the targets and end up splitting them up. Forcing the one assisting you to keep right by your side for the possibly the rest of the battle. Causing him to get in the way of retargeting the mobs for you to resnare, etc....</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><font face=Arial size=2><b>These spells also have a high casting time.</b> So you need plenty of distance to cast it. I have found that running as soon as the casting meter disappears, until the spell icon resets for another cast, is enough time to get the distance you need.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><font face=Arial size=2>Because of the time needed to cast the spell, and the distance needed to cast it safely, it's a good idea to resnare each of the mobs you are kiting once you get to 1/2 mana during the fight.</td></tr></table></center><p align=left><a href=#Contents><font face Arial size=2>Back To Top</font></a></p><a name=Spells><p><u>The spell line up I primarily use is as follows:</u></a> <ul><li>Greater healing <li>Regeneration <li>Shield of brambles <li>Lightning strike <li>Combust (or Firestrike when you get it) <li>Gate <li>Drones of Doom or Drifting death (if the last one standing is stunned you can DOT and med while he dies) <li>Ensnare</ul><p align=left><a href=#Contents><font face Arial size=2>Back To Top</font></a></p></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></table></center></font><p align=justify><br> &nbsp;</p></td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr></table><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td><p align=center style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size=1>All information contained on this website copyright Thistlethorne Enterprises 2001-2002.&nbsp; Everquest copyright Sony Inc.</font></p></td></tr></table><!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table><!--msnavigation--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td><p align=center style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size=1>All information contained on this website copyright Thistlethorne Enterprises 2001-2002.&nbsp; Everquest copyright Sony Inc.</font></p></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table></body></html>
