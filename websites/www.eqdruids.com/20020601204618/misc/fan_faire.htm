<p><font face="Arial">First the pictures!&nbsp; I had taken a TON of pictures 
that I thought people would enjoy.&nbsp; Mainly the different folks in some very 
very nice costumes.&nbsp; Unfortunately there was an incident with the digital 
camera and all the pics were lost!&nbsp; So for those that wanted to see their 
pictures here, I am sorry for that.&nbsp; One of my server mates has promised to 
send me some copies of his pictures, so I will put those up, and anyone else 
that has some good pics of fan faire that they want to share with others, please 
send them to me and I will post them!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Now on to the thanks!&nbsp; I was overwhelmed by the 
support for EQDruids that I was seeing at the Fan Faire.&nbsp; From the folks 
that found me to tell me how much they liked the site, to all those that cheered 
when EQDruids was announced at dinner, to the folks that I was talking with at 
the airport waiting for our plane to be fixed.&nbsp; You guys all make doing 
this worthwhile!&nbsp; I wanted to make sure you all knew how much I appreciated 
your support!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Now for the fun stuff!&nbsp; There were some companies 
that had demos of their new products, new companies coming out, panel 
discussions etc.&nbsp; I'm going to try and remember them all, but if I forget 
anything important make sure to let me know!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">White Wolf and EQ RPG - White Wolf was there doing a demo 
of the upcoming EQ Rpg.&nbsp; The game is a hybrid game, based somewhat in the 
D&amp;D rules.&nbsp; I was very impressed by what I saw so far, and talking to some 
of the White Wolf people there, I think people will be very happy with this game 
when it is released.&nbsp; Yes, there will be Druids in it!!&nbsp; One of the 
more interesting ideas in it I thought, is there will be quests that will start 
in the dice game, then you will go into the online game to get information from 
an NPC, and then return to the dice game.&nbsp; You won't have to be playing 
online at all to enjoy the game, but for those that will be doing both this is a 
nice feature. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">To find out more on the EQ Rpg go
<a href="http://www.eqrpg.com">here</a>&nbsp; There isn't a lot of info there 
yet, but more will be forthcoming.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Cymouse by Maui Innovative - This was a VERY cool item.&nbsp; 
It is a new way to control your mouse in EQ, using your head.&nbsp; You put on 
this head mounted control unit, and the sensor on your computer follows which 
way you are looking and allows you to navigate along EQ while still having the 
ability to type!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Maui Innovative is going to keep us informed as they get 
closer to a release date on the product (should be out in a little while).&nbsp; 
For more info on this product, go
<a href="http://maui-innovative.com/content/VideoGaming.html">here</a></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">There is going to be a new quarterly magazine for 
Everquest!&nbsp; I talked to the authors of this upcoming magazine, and have 
made sure they know to let us help spread the word on it.&nbsp; When more is 
available I will make sure you all are informed!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">One of the best parts of the Fan Faire for me was being 
able to see the documentary Avatars Offline.&nbsp; This documentary was done 
about the effects that the online gaming industry is having on people, business, 
the world etc.&nbsp; Very interesting movie, and I would highly recommend 
everyone see it when it becomes available.&nbsp; The producer is currently 
working on a deal to put it on DVD, and will be letting EQDruids know when it is 
available.&nbsp; So keep an eye out!&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">You can find more info on this documentary at their 
website <a href="http://www.avatarsoffline.com/">here</a></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Some EQ info.&nbsp; They are still working on the caster's 
balancing issues.&nbsp; VI wants to make sure that they changes things properly 
the first time, instead of having to fix things as they go along (I agree with 
this idea).&nbsp; So don't think they have stopped working on such, they are 
working hard on things still!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The next Fan Faire has been announced for June in Boston!&nbsp; 
So for all you East Coasters, start getting ready!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">That is all that comes to mind at the moment.&nbsp; I am 
fairly certain I have forgotten something, but I'm still recovering from the 
trip!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If you were at the Fan Faire and have some info that I 
haven't posted that you feel should be included, please feel free to send it to 
me!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Thanks again all!</font></p>
