        ------------------------------<br>
        <br>
        ** New Plane of Hate **<br>
        <br>
        The new Plane of Hate is now available on Stormhammer. Enjoy!<br>
        <br>
        ** Mitigation Change **<br>
        <br>
        We have evaluated the mitigation abilities of cloth and leather classes, 
        and have made changes as appropriate. For the most part, this change is 
        a reasonable improvement to the ability of monks to absorb damage. At 
        some point in the future we may re-examine the mitigation abilities of 
        chain and plate classes. At this time, and with this final round of 
        changes to cloth and leather classes, we believe that something very 
        close to the appropriate balance is in place.<br>
        <br>
        ** Pathing Update **<br>
        <br>
        The first part of our work to update the pathing system for EverQuest is 
        complete. NPC and pet pathing should be much improved.<br>
        <br>
        ** Charm Changes **<br>
        <br>
        - Healing a charmed pet now generates an appropriate amount of hate for 
        the healer.<br>
        - Charmed pets now take up to one third of the experience for each NPC 
        killed. This amount scales down based on the percentage of damage to the 
        target that the pet does. Dire charm pets still take the same experience 
        they always have.<br>
        - Charmed pets are no longer selected as a monster's preferred target if 
        there are many players available for the monster to attack instead.<br>
        <br>
        ** Windowed Mode for the EverQuest front end **<br>
        <br>
        This patch introduces the ability for players to enter windowed mode at 
        the EverQuest front end (from the time you log in until you get into the 
        game). With this addition, players will be able to run EverQuest in a 
        window from the moment they click on the EverQuest icon to the moment 
        they log out.<br>
        <br>
        In order to switch to windowed mode on the front end, just hit 
        Alt-Enter. Note that there are no settings in the eqclint.ini file for 
        this, you just have to hit Alt-Enter.<br>
        <br>
        Use Alt-R to release the mouse from the EverQuest window (note that once 
        in the game, you need to use Alt-Shift-R to release the mouse).<br>
        <br>
        And, obviously, Alt-Tab will switch between open programs.<br>
        <br>
        We have also added a Tech button that will take you to our Tech Chat. 
        This only works in windowed mode, as it opens up a new window to display 
        the chat.<br>
        <br>
        ** Spells **<br>
        <br>
        - Stoicism now follows the same restrictions as Torpor.<br>
        - Trickster's Augmentation and Boon of the Garou can now be cast by 
        characters on horseback.<br>
        - Fixed a bug that was causing spells with levitation effects to lose 
        levitation if cast over a spell that also had a levitation effect.<br>
        - Bards now receive their first level song at creation.<br>
        - Changed the spelling of &quot;Corpal Empathy&quot; to &quot;Corporeal Empathy&quot;.<br>
        - Changed the hit by message for Torrent of Fatigue recourse to &quot;Your 
        vitality grows.&quot;<br>
        - Changed the wear off message for Song of Sustenance to &quot;Your hunger 
        returns.&quot;<br>
        - Adjusted the shaman spell Disinfecting Aura to be in line with Pure 
        Blood.<br>
        - The Necromancer line of heal-over-time spells should no longer 
        overwrite Transon's Phantasmal Protection.<br>
        - Augment now overwrites Augmentation.<br>
        - Brell's Stalwart Shield now has a casting time of 4 seconds.<br>
        - Spiritual Vigor now has a casting time of 5 seconds.<br>
        - Resurrection no longer gives the &quot;Your strength returns&quot; message two 
        times when the negative effects wear off.<br>
        - Fixed a bug that would cause other players to see a character with 
        default face/hair for their race when they turned off an illusion.<br>
        - Fixed bug that could cause beards to fail to reappear when an illusion 
        wears off. This may also fix some other appearance bugs as well.<br>
        <br>
        ** Illusions/Shape Change **<br>
        <br>
        We have changed the way that Illusions and Shape Changes work with 
        respect to faction. The new system is a lot easier to understand than 
        the old one, so we'll just explain the new one. When changed into the 
        form of a playable race, characters are treated as if they were a member 
        of that race. When changed into a non-playable race, characters retain 
        their own racial factions.<br>
        <br>
        ** PvP **<br>
        <br>
        - If a player is moving when using archery against a PvP target, they 
        have a reduced chance to hit their target.<br>
        - Archery in Player vs. Player combat in now reduced to 66% damage.<br>
        - Direct Damage spells in Player vs. Player combat can only do up to 75% 
        damage of the target's maximum hit points in a single hit. This 
        modification is done before resists are taken into account. For example, 
        if a player has 1000 hit points when fully healed, no single direct 
        damage spell will do more than 750 damage to him in a single hit.<br>
        <br>
        ** Alternate Advancement **<br>
        <br>
        - Alternate Advancement abilities that grant Stamina gains should now 
        update the character's hit points automatically when trained.<br>
        - Dire Charm isno longer &quot;used&quot; when trying to affect an NPC under the 
        power of a Dictate spell. It will not work, and the power is not 
        expended.<br>
        <br>
        ** Interface **<br>
        <br>
        - Using the &quot;/book&quot; command with no page argument now closes the 
        spellbook if it's already open.<br>
        - Added a &quot;Dump&quot; button to Guild Management window. Pressing it creates 
        a text file in the EQ directory containing a comma-delimited text dump 
        of the Guild Management window. The file name will be the guild name 
        with _ instead of spaces, so a guild named &quot;Legacy of Ykesha&quot; would be a 
        file called Legacy_of_Ykesha.txt.<br>
        - Cross-server tells are now filtered under the &quot;tells&quot; filter like 
        same-server tells, and in the same colors.<br>
        - Music Player volume no longer decreases when zoning.<br>
        - The Journal window and Journal Categories window now close when 
        hitting Escape.<br>
        - The Map window no longer pops up after zoning if you used Escape to 
        close it in the previous zone.<br>
        - Hot button names are once again restricted to eight characters. Being 
        able to make them longer was a bug, and was causing issues with 
        displaying more than eight characters.<br>
        - The scrollbar for the Notes window should now update properly when the 
        window is resized.<br>
        - Added multi-select capability to the Friends List, Music, Journal NPC, 
        Journal Text and Journal Category windows. Shift-click selects groups of 
        items, Control-Click selects individual items.<br>
        - Fixed a bug that was causing the Journal window to lose all 
        information since the last save when logging was turned off.<br>
        - Confirmation Dialog window now remembers its position.<br>
        - The third person camera view #3 no longer resets when zoning or using 
        the armor tinting feature.<br>
        - Fixed an uncommon crash caused by the Music Player window.<br>
        - The LFG button in the Group window now toggles the LFG window.<br>
        - Fixed a bug that prevented the attack button from working properly 
        when a Centi Warspear was equipped.<br>
        - The dialog box for confirmation of a change in video modes now remains 
        open for 30 seconds instead of 15 seconds.<br>
        - Added a &quot;Show Offline&quot; button to the Guild Management window. This 
        determines whether or not you want to show offline people in the window, 
        and the setting is remembered when you log out.<br>
        - If you sort by anything other than Name in the Guild Management 
        window, the window will sub-sort your list by name.<br>
        - Changed the promote button in the Guild Management window to only be 
        enabled when eligible guild member is targeted (not just selected in 
        window).<br>
        - Fixed a problem that caused a few people to have the spell particle 
        density revert to default off when they logged off.<br>
        -Fixed the Map window to remove a method of avoiding the map 
        restrictions in certain zones. <br>
        - Added /getguildmotd. This command allows you to see your guild message 
        of the day at any time.<br>
        - /guildmotd now sets or clears the guild message of the day. If used 
        with no text, it clears the existing message of the day. Only leaders 
        and officers can use this command<br>
        - Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when pressing the U key while in 
        explore mode.<br>
        - When under the effects of invisibility, a character that hides and 
        then moves and breaks their hide also breaks their invisibility. The 
        invisibility icon will now disappear under this circumstance so that the 
        player knows he is no longer invisible.<br>
        - Closing the AA window no longer causes the resurrection notification 
        box to disappear.<br>
        - Updated the category lists in the Bazaar window to be alphabetical.<br>
        - Characters will no longer be prevented from being a trader if you 
        quickly click on Begin/End Trader.<br>
        - Fixed a bug with the LFG tool that may have been causing some people 
        to crash when zoning.<br>
        - New colors should no longer be moving from the armor dye column to the 
        item tint column when a character is saved.<br>
        - Hand to hand weapons now &quot;greys out&quot; the melee attack button.<br>
        - For those that type quickly, typing %t1 now has the same effect as 
        typing %t 1.<br>
        - Fixed a bug that prevented you from purchasing a lore item if you have 
        just purchased that item and destroyed it.<br>
        - Setting loot split color now changes the text color when others loot 
        and autosplit, as well as when the player loots.<br>
        - Language skills now update in the skills window immediately, and the 
        message given upon skill up includes the name of the language improved.<br>
        - Default chat channels should now be saved properly.<br>
        <br>
        ** NPCs **<br>
        <br>
        - Corrected an issue with trainers that sometimes caused them to kick a 
        character out of the game.<br>
        - Tin Soldiers no longer give stun immune messages to color flux when 
        they are already stunned.<br>
        - Sollari Bekines now asks for two vials of Gnoll blood instead of one. 
        She has always wanted two for her quest.<br>
        - Corrected some text errors for Avir Sterbla.<br>
        - Fixed a spelling error in Paralin Notion's text. &quot;Other&quot; now reads 
        &quot;Others&quot;.<br>
        - Corrected a spelling error in the Stonefist Clansman's death text. 
        Deafening was spelled incorrectly.<br>
        - Fixed a problem that may have been causing various Brutes to spawn 
        under the world in Warsliks Woods.<br>
        - Corrected an issue that could cause multiple NPCs related to the ring 
        war event to appear in Eastern Wastes.<br>
        - Also corrected an issue with the ring war that was causing some of the 
        NPCs to disappear too early.<br>
        - Undead Sebilisian Lich is now undead. He just didn't realize it 
        before. Feel free to send cards and flowers.<br>
        - So is the Fading Specter in Tox.<br>
        - As is the Failed Apprentice.<br>

        to be drinking their own blood.<br>
        - NPCs in Stonebrunt won't be wandering into the ocean and getting lost.<br>

        inventory slots free.<br>

        - A ghoul in Neriak shouldn't be banging his head on a wall due to a 
        pathing error. If he does it now, it's out of frustration about the way 
        his Dark Elven masters let stinky Trolls into their city.<br>
        - Corrected a spelling error in Elial Brook's text.<br>
        - Frist Furtun now accepts all Upheaval scrolls for his quest.<br>
        - The invisible, untargetable NPCs in the elemental planes that were 
        attacking people have been evicted. Absor is now using them as avatars 
        in PlanetSide, and his scores have gone way up.<br>
        - Corrected a spelling error in the agro text of an Enthralled Underbulk 
        (changed &quot;lungs&quot; to &quot;lunges&quot;).<br>

        word &quot;you&quot; where it as needed).<br>
        - Corrected a spelling error in the text of Elder Animist Dumul 
        (replaced &quot;lose&quot; with &quot;loose&quot;).<br>

        want.<br>
        - Raewyth Velanor now knows the difference between viscous and vicious.<br>
        - Corrected the text for Wevek Redforge, changed &quot;were&quot; to &quot;we're&quot;.<br>

        - Corrected the spelling of the word &quot;privilege&quot; for Tax Collector 
        Khugra.<br>
        - Corrected the spelling of Incantator Stevak. Changed &quot;and&quot; to &quot;any&quot;.<br>

        <br>
        ** Items **<br>
        <br>
        - Added a Brass Instrument modifier to the Horn of Shadows.<br>
        - Made Saltwater Seaweed stackable.<br>
        - Due to a drop table error, all existing instances of the Market Signet 
        have been changed to have no stats. If you received one legitimately 
        through the quest, you can give the old item to Aid Grimel for a new one 
        with all the correct stats. If you do not meet the requirements, Aid 
        Grimel will not reimburse you.<br>
        - Changed the spelling from Mythril to Mithril on Mithril Knuckles and 
        Mithril Edged Skull Splitter.<br>
        - Removed the ability to be used in the secondary slot from Club of the 
        Secretive. This is a Cleric, Druid, Shaman only item.<br>
        - Removed Bards from being able to equip a Combine Acrylia Halberd and 
        Combine Acrylia Two Handed Sword. These weapons are two-handed slash.<br>
        - The name of the Holy Order of Mithanial has been correctly spelled.<br>
        - Darksight Dagger is no longer listed as being equipable in the 
        secondary hand. It is a caster only item.<br>
        - Barbed Rubicite Coif has had its name change to Barbed Rubicite 
        Pauldrons, since it is a shoulder item, not a head item.<br>
        - Kagazz's Box now combines four scorpion legs to create a Box of 
        Scorpion Legs.<br>
        - Removed Bards and Rogues from the list of classes on Greatstaff of the 
        Four Winds, since they could not use the item.<br>
        - Sample Chest is no longer No Rent.<br>
        - Mushroom Bread now looks like bread in inventory rather than a bowl.<br>
        - Corrected the spelling of venomous on a few items.<br>
        <br>
        ** Miscellaneous **<br>
        <br>
        - Modified checklist flags to make them a little easier to understand 
        (checklist flags are the flags that you obtain for doing PoP events out 
        of order that allow you to complete the final flag quest by gathering 
        all the checklist flags and talking to a Seer). Now when you receive a 
        checklist flag you get a different message than the one that you get 
        when you receive a normal flag. Ask the seer to unlock memories and she 
        will tell you which checklist flags you have. <br>
        - Corrected a problem that was causing PoP raid flag mobs to not give 
        out flags to anyone if the associated boss was killed by someone not in 
        the raid group. Now if someone not in a raid gets the kill, only people 
        not in a raid can get flagged. This means that people may have to leave 
        a raid to get flagged, but it means that raids should no longer miss 
        flags if someone outside the raid gets the kill.<br>
        - Modified several of the Planes of Power alternate entry quests to make 
        completing them faster. Also, all of these quests will now give a &quot;key&quot; 
        to everyone in the group of the person that completes it.<br>
        - Corrected a spelling error in the text message given when you can no 
        longer add unflagged people to your raid (&quot;to&quot; is now &quot;too&quot;).<br>
        - Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause helmets to seem to disappear 
        off a character that was dealing with a merchant or casting an illusion.<br>
        - /Consent no longer gives both a success and fail message to player 
        consented.<br>
        - Frogloks wearing robes no longer lose the color on the bottom portion 
        of their robes when they zone.<br>
        - Fixed some issues with alchemy not combining into dose potions.<br>
        - Fixed a bug that could cause invalid and unchangeable numbers to 
        appear in spell-casting specialization skills if the skill was trained 
        up after level 50.<br>
        - Merchants no longer claim that they will pay 1 copper for newbie items 
        that they can't actually buy.<br>
        - The player's first person perspective now changes correctly if the 
        height of their Froglok is changed. <br>
        - Removed an unneeded door in High Keep.<br>

        <br>
        - <b>Added the ability for any caster to research dropped priest spells 
        using the research books found in Gunthak. The research notes for these

        quest. <br>
        - <b>Modified the Pureblood quest to return Blood of Nadox for Shaman

        and received Pure Blood will be able to obtain the Blood of Nadox scroll 
        simply by hailing the quest NPC. </b><br>
        - Increased the drop rate significantly on the quest items for the 
        ShadowKnight and Necromancer Legacy of Ykesha spells. <br>
        - Added an NPC to the list of monsters that can be summoned by Magicians

        spell <br>
        - Changed Strength of the Diaku to a single target strength and 
        dexterity buff. <br>
        - Changed Talisman of the Diaku to a group strength and dexterity buff.
        <br>
        - Replaced the shaman spell Aim of the Ginda with Talisman of Alacrity, 
        which is a group haste spell. <br>
        - Replaced the shaman spell Talisman of the Gindan with Tiny Terror, 
        which is a group shrink spell. <br>

        - Song of the Deep Seas now says: &quot;The fury of the deep sea fills your 
        arms&quot; when sung (changed &quot;see&quot; to &quot;sea&quot;). <br>
        - Changed the spelling of Malise to Malaise. <br>
        - Boneshear spell messages changed to make more sense. <br>
        - Iceflame of E`Ci now gives a message when it wears off. <br>

        armor and Spiritstone of Cabilis. <br>
        - Corrected an issue with foldable medicine bags and foldable bearskin 
        potion bags. Items should now combine properly. <br>
        - Clockwork Observer legs and boots should now recharge. <br>
        - Class 3 Wood Point Arrows now have a range of 5 instead of 0. <br>
        - Changed Blessed Scout Arrows, Blessed Warrior Arrows, Mithril Scout 
        Arrows, Mithril Warrior Arrows, Mithril Champion Arrows and Blessed

        - Rune Smudged Bone Spear now looks like a spear in inventory rather 
        than a rapier. <br>

        <br>

        - Purify Soul now removes a larger number of poison, disease and curse 
        counters. <br>
        - Changed Frenzy of Spirit to stack better with haste spells. <br>
        <br>
        ** Quests ** <br>
        <br>
        -<b> Performed surgery on Ragefire to remove his extraneous heart. </b>
        <br>
        - Verina and Drozlin will also only be dropping one set of items. <br>
        - Omat Vastsea will now summon Jhassad Oceanson if hailed by a character 
        in possession of the Orb of Vapor. He will summon the Avatar of Water if 
        the character has the Orb of the Triumvirate. But he will not summon 
        either if one of them is already around. <br>
        - Corrected issues with Shaman quest for Stoicism. The impassive sea 
        spirit was giving out the wrong item. <br>
        - Brohan Ironforge's search for his daughter can now be completed. <br>
        - Gimlik Cogbobble should now be more reliable. <br>
        - Sentry Rotiart now enacts his role in his quest properly. <br>
        - Tilbok Furrunner will now recharge the Mask of Espionage. <br>
        - Firiona Drixies now have a chance to drop Firiona Drixie Dust. <br>
        - Heretic Drahur no longer gives out Greater Immobilize for a Spectral 
        Parchment, only for an Ethereal Parchment. <br>
        <br>
        ** Interface ** <br>
        <br>
        - Added a command to allow you to toggle your target between your two 
        last targets (unlike Tab which toggles between your character and your 
        last target). To set the key that activates this feature, just open your 
        options window and select the Keyboard Tab. If you select all 
        categories, the entry will be the last one on the list, called Toggle 
        last two targets. This was actually added with our last patch. <br>
        <br>
        ** NPCs ** <br>
        <br>
        - Undead will begin to spawn again at night in Kithicor. <br>
        - Shin Master Grubbus in Gukta will now be more selective about who he 
        allows to do tasks for him, and he'll be speaking directly to folks 
        (using /tell). His chatty nature was raising the volume in Gukta to 
        levels that were considered unacceptable. He will also be a bit clearer 
        about what he wants. <br>
        - Shar Vahl guards will now defend their city against Loda Kai poachers.
        <br>
        - A Grimy Owl Bear Cub in Paludal now &quot;screeches&quot;, not &quot;screetches&quot;. <br>
        - Eirod Haerod in Mistmoore will no longer have a square showing in the 
        word &quot;don't&quot; in her text. <br>
        - Mangler will no longer spawn on top of a table. <br>
