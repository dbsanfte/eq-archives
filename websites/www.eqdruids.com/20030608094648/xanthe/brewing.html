<p><img src="pietin.jpg" align="left" width="50" height="47"><a name="intro">Brewing</a> can be an immense amount of fun. Ok, the icon is a Pie Tin, but hey, I'm out of pictures... I started because my primary trade skill used to be Smithing, and I thought that some day I might need to make some tempers for the Cultural Armours. As it turns out, I lost my great interest in Smithing after it became apparent that the high end smithed armours are insanely expensive to make, take incredibly high skill to achieve, and I can’t wear any of them. But Brewing had become fun to do, so I kept at it. It also gave me a use for all the foraged Fruit and Veg that I had stored up in the bank.</p><br>

Due to recent improvements, it is now possible to brew drinks that give stats (much like stat food made by Baking). These are a nice touch, and are used simply by having them as your first available drink item in your bags. They are not used as part of the skill up route that I have devised, but I like them a lot, and as they are Useful Things That You Can Make (tm), they shall have their own section. Visit them here! <a href="statdrinks.html"><font size=+2 color="ff0000">Enhancing Grog!</font></a><p><br>

<p><img src="pietin.jpg" align="left" width="50" height="47"><a name="where">I </a>have found that the best place by far to brew (at least for me and other accepted races) is Freeport. The three zones have pretty much everything you need to get to Grandmaster. West Freeport has the Brewing Vendor, Kristin Charcoal, and she is located near the gate. She sells things like Malt, Barley, Yeast, Hops and the like. I am unsure of where other similar vendors are found in Norrath, but there must be some somewhere. Other things you will need like Bottles, Grapes, Casks and Shot Glasses can be found in most bars and pubs, of which there are many in Freeport.<p>

You will also need water a lot of the time. The other thing you will need is the Brew Barrel. For those of you who have never seen one, here it is <a href="brewbarrel.jpg">Pic of Brew Barrel</a>. It’s the big barrel on it’s side on top of a box. These can be found in all 3 of Freeport’s zones, usually in or near a pub.<p>

If Freeport is not an option for you, then most towns do have a decent stock of brewing ingredients. If I am not near Freeport, I do my Brewing in Shadowhaven (on Luclin). If you have this expansion, and can't go to Freeport, then I really do recommend Shadowhaven for Brewing. The only things that I can't find there (but may just have missed), are Fresh Fish (for fish wine), and the racial brews such as Dwarven Ale etc. (Gnomish Spirits IS available from a Gnome in a tent near the Tinkering shop).

<p><img src="pietin.jpg" align="left" width="50" height="47"><a name="startbrew">Quite</a> a few new brews have been introduced over the last six months or so, and so I thought it was about time to overhaul the mastery route. It's been quite difficult to sort it all into one table (as opposed to the three tables I had before), due to having to take into account the avilability of ingredients that different people might have. For instance, LOTS of brews require you to have access to a LOT of foraged items like vegetables, berries and such. This is fine for us outdoors types, but for other it's just a pain in the arse. Another example could be that a particular town may not have all the regular Barley Hops Malt etc. SO, I have taken a leaf out of the guide I did on poisons, and made a banded table of recipes.<p>

<br>
Depending on what materials you have available, I have provided in some cases a choice of brews to make to fill a certain skill level range. Where there is a choice for a certain skill range, these brews have been "blocked" together on the table by a colour band. For instance, at around the 100 or so trivial level, you can make either Vegetable Oil, Paeala Bark Tannin, White Wine, or Red Wine to get to roughly the same skill level, so these are in the same "block". That is why the tables are stripey. Pick whichever recipe from that block you have ingredients available for at the time.<p>

<img src="barrelopen.jpg" width="118" height="388"><p><br>

As always, NEVER stack items in the combining container, and NEVER use Summoned or Foraged water, it just won’t work.<p>

Where there is a container mentioned, just throw one of them into the Brew Barrel along with the rest of the ingredients and hit combine. Ie. For Bog Juice put 1 water, 1 Snake Scales and 1 Bottle into the Brew Barrel and combine.<p>

If you are successful you will receive a beverage, and in some cases some empty bottles. If you are unsuccessful your container will be returned to you, and the rest of the items will disappear.<p><br>

<font size=+1><b><u><a name="notes">And now for some Notes</a></b></u></font><p><br>

<b>Vendors</b><p>

The brewing vendors in Shadowhaven are Lander Furthers, and his wife Mrs. Furthers. They are located centrally in the zone. If you zone in from Bazaar, go up the stairs to your left. Keep going until you are on the main level, run under the building on wooden stilts, and he's in one of the shops on your left. These two vendors sell things like Barley, Malt, Casks, Grapes, etc.<p><br>

In Freeport, your brewing vendor for Barley, Malt etc. is Krystin Charcoal, located by the gate in West Freeport. Run into the zone through the gates and take immediate left. Follow the left wall, turning back on yourself pretty much, and she is right there. Casks and whatnot can be found in pubs and like. No shortage of those in Freeport.<p><br>

<b>*</b> These use foraged items. Easier to get now the Bazaar is working, but if you're not a forager, you might want to skip these.<p><br>

<b>**Paeala Bark Tannin.</b> This can be bought from Lander Furthers, the brewing vendor in Shadowhaven. It costs roughly 2pp per bark, so it's a bit expensive, but the tannin can be sold back for a reasonable amount, plus Tailors use it so you can sell it to them. Also, the recipe is quick and easy, minimal arseing about, limited stress to the wrist. If you can afford it, do it.<p><br>

<b>***Cultural Drinks.</b> Dwarven Ale, Elven Wine etc. These can be difficult to get hold of, but East Freeport does stock them (the Blue Building on the way to the Smithing Vendors, go left at the T junction after coming in from the gate). I should imagine that Kelethin and Felwithe might also stock at least Elven Wine and possibly a couple of the others.<p><br>


<b>****Skull Ale.</b> If you fancy doing this, get thee hence to South Karana and kill an Undead Cyclops. Nick it's skull and brew with it. The skull is NOT used up during the process.<p><br>

<b>*****Brut Champagne.</b> This is to get you the last couple of points after Mino's. A relatively simple recipe, aside from needing to brew Soda water (1 Soda, 1 water triv 58. Buy the Soda from Ryver Mudhands in Shadowhaven, if you're not a shorty, then either do the necklace quest, or bribe someone to buy it for you), and the Champagne Magnum. This is made by jewellers, and is trivial at 196 skill. 1 Enchanted Gold Bar, 1 Bottle and 1 Opal in a jewellers kit makes 1 Magnum. This Magnum is NOT returned whether you fail or succeed. When making them, remember to put in the frickin' bottle, or you end up with a necklace instead (/bonk self).<br>There are three types of Champagne you can make, Sec, Demi-Sec and Brut, using 1, 2 or 3 grapes respectively. Sec and Demisec trivial at 250, and Brut at over 250, so I have chosen Brut to hopefully get the skillups easier. It should be noted however that Demisec Champagne is used in the Protection of the Cabbage Earring quest, so if you make that instead you can sell it on to questors.<p><br><br>
