This starts either the library book or Vasty Deep Quest. The librarian tells you she doesn't have it but that a person on the top floor knows the person who last checked it out. When you ask him, he tells you that the person who checked out the book is named Moodoro Finharn and that he was executed in Qeynos for crimes against the state. He tells you to go talk to his sister Nolusia who is in the Erudin Palace. Once there, she says to meet her just outside the hotel in town to talk to her. When you meet her, she explains that her brother is still alive. Her brother is at Crows (It seems he is sick and is in need of some Erud's Tonic. This is a side quest). <br> <br> Go to Qeynos and talk to him. Ask him about Highpass and ask about The Testament of Vanear, and he tells you that he did indeed buy page 30 from a man named Moodoro some time ago but that it was recently stolen by a man wearing the uniform of a Qeynos guard and that this guard was still in Highpass, because he could &quot;feel it&quot;. He also says that Moodoro also had page 34 but refused to sell it to him. If you go into highhold pass and go toward the orc side, you will see a lake or pond or whatever. Jump in and swim around until you come to a hidden camp of smugglers. Only one npc there has a name, which is Dyllin Starshine. Kill him and you get page 30 (and you also get a sealed letter which is for the Muffin for Panos Quest in Freeport). Beware that any smugglers around him will come to his aid. Faction hits when you kill him are:(-Corrupt Qeynos Guard, +Guards of Quenos, -Kane Bayle, -Circle of Unseen Hands, -BloodSabers) The faction hits for him are pretty large, so be aware after that of potentially slipping to KOS in Qeynos. <br> <br> After going back to Qeynos, go back to Moodoro and say I want page 34. He says ahh so you figured out I have page 34 pretty smart of me to rip out the most valuable page and that it doesn't matter if I get it because the work is fiction anyway. He then offers to play a game with you for the page. For 4 gold he will deal you one card and if that one card is a jester he will give you the page. Along with the jester, you might also draw the King, Queen, Beggar, or Knight. [Note - keep the Knights and give them to the dwarf on Eriolissi Island for a reward]. Once the whole thing is combined you get the Testament of Vanear, which has stats of +10 wis and +10 mana, and is a no drop lore item. You can keep the testament and use it, or you can return the testament to Rarnan, who started the quest, for some platinum. <br> <br> NOTE: I am told that you can avoid Erudin completely by giving Moodoro Finharn 2gp (the same guy that you get page 34 from) and he gives you the 2-slot book of the testament of Vanear. Once you get the book, you can combine the page you get from Moodoro (by playing his card game) and the other page from Dylin in HighHold Pass and you've got the book! No need to go to Erudia. And because Moodoro sometimes hangs out at one of the sewer entrances, evil races could sneak in and get the book, too. )</p><p align=justify>Reward:</p><p align=justify style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>Testament of Vanear</b></p><p align=justify style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Magic Item, Lore, No drop</p><p align=justify style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">+10 wis, +10 Mana</p><p align=justify style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">All/All Secondary Hand</p></td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr></table><!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table><!--msnavigation--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td><p align=center style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size=1>All information contained on this website copyright Thistlethorne Enterprises 2001-2002.&nbsp; Everquest copyright Sony Inc.</font></p></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table></body></html>
