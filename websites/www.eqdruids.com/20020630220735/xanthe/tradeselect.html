<b>From this page</b> you will be able to choose which Trade Skill you wish to look at. The guides are set out with a brief introduction and an explanation of useful/relevant material, then a step by step analysis of the route taken to mastery, showing for each step; which item was made, what the ingredients were, and what the trivial ranges are.<p><br>

For some of the skills there may also be a section showing alternative routes, for where some items might be difficult to acquire, and other items might need to be made in order to skill up. After that there is a table of items which are needed, but are made using another Trade Skill. Lastly there is a table of useful items that can be made, and are required by another trade skill.<p><br>

<b>Note:-</b> When I do my trade skills to increase my skill level I do not always work all the way up to the trivial point for an item. I find that the closer my skill gets to the trivial point, the longer it takes me to gain a skill point. Maybe I’m imagining things, I don’t know.<p>

For instance, if I am making an arrow that will go trivial at 162 I might make them until my skill is around 157, and then move on to the next highest trivial arrow. Also, when I have been following guides to help me with my trade skills, I sometimes skip certain stages that would not gain me many skill points, or where I would find it difficult to get hold of some of the items.<p>

For instance, if my Fletching skill were 36 (arrow gone trivial) the next numerical step I could take would be to make the 46 trivial arrow. However, as I am near the trivial mark I skip that type of arrow, and move on to making the 56 trivial arrow instead.<p>

The guides here reflect the choices that I made on my way to mastery. There may be some items in between two trivial levels that can be made, but I didn’t use them, so they are not here. I chose the quickest, easiest and cheapest routes I could find, and as has been said before, there is no definitive list on this site of every item under the sun that can be made.<p>

Hopefully my guides will be of good use to people wanting to get their skill up there as efficiently as they can, and hopefully to others aswell. If you have a doubt about something, or wonder if there is a step you feel you would rather do please visit the links section where there are many fine websites listed that can help you in your quest:)<p><br>
