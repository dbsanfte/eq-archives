  Ask 'What do you suspect?' <br>

  watched over them. Druids and rangers, worshippers of both Karana and Tunare, 
  have reported a feeling of hatred throughout their once peaceful lands' <br>

  Ask 'Perhaps it is Innoruuk?' <br>
  'Innoruuk? Perhaps. Aye. It must be. Perhaps I knew and didn't want to 
  consider the possibility. It must be this though, and some action will have to 
  be taken' <br>

  Ask 'What action should I take?' <br>
  Telin Darkforest looks at you consideringly and then scribbles something 
  quickly on a small, worn paper. 'You seem powerful enough. Perhaps you can 
  help those who seek to protect nature's peace. Take this note. Deliver it only 
  into the hands of Faelin Bloodbriar. Where you will find her, I cannot say.
