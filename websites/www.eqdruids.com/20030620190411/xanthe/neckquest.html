<b>Ahhhh Shadowhaven.....</b>a wonderous zone filled with many handy vendors for almost every skill. But I don't like to speak to Wood Elves, let alone sell to them! /sigh. Shadowhaven's vendors are split into 4 houses, and no matter what race you are, there'll always be at least one that will have nothing to do with you. Fortunately you can improve your standing with merchants by obtaining your Amulet of the Haven, proving yourself to be a recognised trader.<p><br>

<u><b><font size=+1>Stage 1</b></u></font><p><br>

Your quest begins with Trade Commissioner Henry, who can be found in the building in front of the bridge that leads to Paludal Caverns.<p>

Hail him, and say 'I will deliver these letters'.<p>

He will give you a Tattered Newsletter. Take this to Sateal Deirosap who can be found in the middle building in the Bazaar, which is adjacent to Shadowhaven.<p><br>

<u><b><font size=+1>Stage 2</b></u></font><p><br>

Mr. Deirosap is pleased that you have brought him the letter, and gives you his sales report to take back to Trade Commissioner Henry who then gives you a Book of Sales Secrets. This book is to be taken to Thar Anton in Fungus Grove.<p><br>

<u><b><font size=+1>Stage 3</b></u></font><p><br>

To get to Fungus Grove from Shadowhaven, you must travel through Echo Caverns (the secret bit). To do this, run to the soul binder in Shadowhaven (near the big pool of water and transport pads). Go in the door next to the Soulbinder and you find yourself in a room full of doors leaning up against the walls. Go into the room and hit the opposite wall. Turn left and run forward through the secret wall. Follow it until you zone into Echo Caverns.<p>

Now that you are in Echo Caverns run forward and take a left. Go along the tunnel and through the big metal doors. Keep going and you will come to a place where the main tunnel curves around to the right and a narrower tunnel continues straight ahead of you. Ignore the small tunnel and carry on to the right down the main tunnel. <b>AVOID THE PLANTS</b> (the moving ones), if you touch them they will root or nuke you or something. You can't kill em, they are just traps. Anyway, keep going along the tunnel. You will find yourself in some shallow water, just keep going and stay in the main tunnel (ignore the exits to your right with large plants hanging from the ceiling). In a short while the main tunnel will curve again to the right. Follow it and you will see a line of small stones across your path. This is the zoneline to Fungus Grove.<p><br>

You are now in the Fungus Grove outpost. Run throught the town until you find a small lake with a buiding on stilts in it. Ignore that building, and go to the building on your left. Inside is Thar Anton. Hail him and hand him the Book of Sales Secrets. He gives you his Economy Report and some faction adjustments.<p><br> 

Your faction standing with Traders of the Haven got better. 
Your faction standing with House of Fordel got better. 
Your faction standing with House of Midst got better. 
Your faction standing with House of Stout got better. 
You gain party experience!! <p><br>

Take the Report back to Henry again in Shadowhaven (retrace your steps through Echo Caverns).<p><br>


<u><b><font size=+1>Stage 4</b></u></font><p><br>

Give the Economy Report to Trade Commissioner Henry, and collect your reward of the Amulet of the Haven and some more faction adjustments.

This item gives positive faction to Traders of the Haven.<br>

Wearing the necklace improves your faction with these four groups, so that you can freely trade with all. The quest can be done in 10 minutes with a sow, 15 without. If you plan on spending a lot of time in Shadowhaven, make your life a little bit easier and get it done:)
