  <b><font face="Arial">This is the third Prayer Shawl Quest. You must do the 
  first two before doing this. Ask Borannin &quot;What chore?&quot; and he will start you 
  on the third quest. <br>
  <br>
  Loremaster Borannin says 'Ahh, some fine specimens indeed, Dyllwin . I will 
  have the best of these mounted at once, wish me luck in the contest! Here is 
  the Cloth Prayer Shawl of our people. Before I forget, the council has issued 
  yet another [chore] for you to complete. <br>
  Your faction standing with Coldain got better <br>
  Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better <br>
  Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse <br>
  Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse <br>
  You gain experience!! <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'What chore?' <br>
  <br>
  Loremaster Borannin says 'The council agrees that you have demonstrated a 
  disdain for our enemy, the Kromrif, that rivals our own. They now ask that you 
  demonstrate your loyalty to the Dain by humbling yourself and serving our 
  people. Give this, my seal, to Mordrin. He will instruct you further. <br>
  <br>
  Borannin tells you to go to Mordrin, but that is a typo, he really means 
  Mordin, the guy in the butcher shop. <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'hail Mordin Frostcleaver' <br>
  <br>
  Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Ah, hello there, and welcome to me shop, Halfling. 
  Ye'll have to excuse the mess but I've been havin a bloody good time here 
  lately. . . HAR HAR, ye get it? Anyways, thanks to you offlanders I now have a 
  selection of some exotic meats never afore seen here on Velious. In addition 
  to supplyin' the freshest meat in Thurgadin I also offer tasks to would-be 
  hunters in the wastes. <br>
  <br>
  I gave Mordin Borannin's seal and he said the following. <br>
  <br>
  Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Hullo Dyllwin , I see you've signed on for a bit of 
  food service eh? Well we can always use an extra pair a hands here dat's fer 
  sure. First things first, warsh yer grubby mitts an cook up dinner fer good ol 
  Leif. Shouldn be too tough fer ye, he has simple enough taste. Make him a 
  Tundrabear sandwich an lemme know when he's been fed. Dontcha ferget ta give 
  him this with his meal. <br>
  Your faction standing with Coldain got better <br>
  Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better <br>
  Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse <br>
  Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse <br>
  You gain experience!! <br>
  <br>
  He gives you a napkin named &quot;Leif's Napkin&quot; is No Drop. <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'What is a Tundrabear Sandwich?' <br>
  <br>
  Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Dat's easy, ye just take a slab a dat Tundra Kodiak 
  meat and a jug a sauce, put it in da oven, den combine the product with a loaf 
  a bread in a mixin bowl an there ye be. <br>
  <br>
  Get a Tundra Kodiak meat, put it in oven with sauce and make &quot;Saucy Kodiak 
  Meat&quot; (name?). Put your creation in a mixing bowl with one loaf of bread, 
  which Mordin sells, and combine. If your skill is high enough you get the 
  sandwich. Turn this in to Guard Leif with the napkin and get a &quot;Used Napkin&quot; 
  back. It is also No Drop.<br>
  <br>
  Give the used napkin to Mordin and get the next part of the quest. He needs 
  you to make some Snow Bunny Stew for Trita Coldheart (name?). You get &quot;Trita's 
  Napkin&quot; (No Drop).<br>
  <br>
  You say, 'What is Snow Bunny Stew' <br>
  <br>
  Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Simple enuff, getcherself two hunksa Bunny meat and 
  a jug a sauces. Stir 'em in a mixin bowl, then put spices and two flasks a 
  water with it and cook it in a pot. Mmmm, zesty! <br>
  <br>
  Once you mix the ingredients in the bowl and get your &quot;Saucy Rabbit&quot; you put 
  that, one spice, 2 flasks of water and a pot into the oven to make the stew. 
  The pot can be made with the smithing skill, and maybe even pottery, although 
  I hadn't worked on that at this point.<br>
  <br>
  Give the stew to Trita with the Napkin and you'll receive a dirty pot in 
  return. Give the dirty pot back to Mordin and you will receive the next part 
  of the quest.<br>
  <br>
  Next you need to create an Ulthork Meat Pie for Brita. You receive Brita's 
  napkin, No Drop. <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'What is Ulthork Meat Pie?' <br>
  <br>
  Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Hmm, lemme look that one up. Been awhile since I 
  made one. Here we are, two Ulthork meats, a vinegar and a spices in a mixin 
  bowl. Put yer meat mix, a clump a dough, an a pie tin in da oven an yer good 
  ta go. <br>
  <br>
  Go hunt up the ulthork meat in Eastern Wastes and combine as instructed above.<br>
  <br>
  Turn the pie and the napkin in to Loremaster Brita in the back of the Library 
  and receive a dirty pie tin which you take back to Mordin for the final step 
  in this quest.<br>
  <br>
  The final task is to create a Snow Griffin Soufflé. The person you are making 
  this for is none other than the Grand Historian Thoridain himself.<br>
  <br>
  You say, 'What is Snow Griffin Souffle?' <br>
  <br>
  Mordin Frostcleaver says 'This one's a bit tricky, ya toss four snow griffin 
  eggs and a pack of spices in de oven. Ye must bake it just right or it's all 
  gunna be wasted. When yer done bring it to Thoridain and if ye did it right 
  he'll give ye his special seal. Just show Borannin that seal and yer shawl and 
  he'll know that yer finished in the kitchen. <br>
  <br>
  Snow griffin eggs are found on Snow Griffins in Eastern Wastes.&nbsp; They can 
  take a little time to find, so be patient.</font></b><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <b><font face="Arial">Also be careful, some of the griffins are Druids, and 
  can be fairly nasty if you aren't prepared.&nbsp; The good news is they are 
  charmeable, so you can send one griffin against another.</font></b><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <b><font face="Arial">Once you've made the souffle turn it in to Grand 
  Historian Thoridain with the napkin. <br>
  <br>
  Grand Historian Thoridain says 'My compliments, what a wonderful dish! Please 
  accept my personal Seal as a token of my appreciation. May it give you power 
  over your adversaries. </font></b><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <b><font face="Arial"><br>

  Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better <br>

  Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse <br>
  You gain experience!! <br>
  <br>
  He gives you his Seal to give to Borannin with your second Prayer Shawl.&nbsp; 
  Don't worry, you will get the seal back later.</font></b><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  &nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <b>Give Borannin your previous prayer shawl and the seal.</b><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
  <b><font face="Arial"><br>
  Loremaster Borannin says 'Well done, the council will be impressed with your 
  effort. Here is the woven prayer shawl, wear it with pride. I know there is 
  talk of great plans for you, be sure to come back and ask me what the council 
  has [brewing].</font></b><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
