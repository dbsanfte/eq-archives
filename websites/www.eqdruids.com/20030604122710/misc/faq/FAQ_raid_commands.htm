<font face="Arial">The Raid functionality has been added. Here is a brief 
overview of the Raid system.
<p>In the past, experience on raids would generally go to a single group or a 
few groups. The group doing the most damage would get the experience on any 
given kill. But, that has been changed by a new Raid feature. </p>
<p>The Raid system is intended to aid in the formation and organizing raids and 
make looting on raids a little more manageable. It allows a certain amount of 
experience to be shared among all members of a raid. The basics of the system 
work very much like grouping has always worked. The Raid Leader is the leader of 
all the raid groups and the group leaders remain leaders of their individual 
groups. </p>
<p><b>Alt-R</b> or <b>/raidwindow</b> will toggle the new Raid Window. This 
window works much like the group window. You can invite people to the raid (if 
you are the raid leader) and see a list of the folks in your raid, along with 
the status of those members (Raid Leader, Group Leader or raid member - which 
shows with no rank). It also shows you the group number of the individual 
members. </p>
<p><u>Only Raid Leaders and Raid Group Leaders can invite people to a raid.</u> 
This is done with the Invite button on the raid window. </p>
<p>If a Raid Leader invites an individual (someone not in a group), that person 
joins the raid as a Raid Group Leader. If the Raid Leader invites a member of a 
group, the entire group joins the raid, and their group leader becomes a Raid 
Group Leader. </p>
<p>A Raid Group Leader can invite people to their group, thus inviting them to 
join the raid group as well. </p>
<p><u>Only a Raid Leader can remove someone from the raid.</u> He or she does so 
simply by clicking on the character's name in the raid window and clicking the 
Disband button (also in the raid window). </p>
<p>Being removed from your group (using the normal grouping features) will not 
remove you from the raid. </p>
<p>You can remove yourself from the raid just by clicking the Disband button in 
the raid window. </p>
<p>Just like groups, raids have their own chat channel. <b>/rsay</b> works for 
the raid just as /gsay does for groups. Just like group chat, you can set this 
to be your default channel for a given chat window by choosing it from the 
right-click Default Channel context menu. </p>
<p>Experience for killing NPCs will be distributed to all members of the raid 
that are within range. However, the experience given will be smaller than the 
experience that would be earned by a single group. Generally, unless you are 
fighting NPCs that require a raid, you will still be better off earning 
experience with the old fashioned six-person group. </p>
<p>Raids will definitely allow for larger than traditional groups, however, much 
of EverQuest is designed with the six-person group in mind. Adding a small 
number of people to a given group will allow this &quot;oversized&quot; group to gain 
experience. However, we recommend that once a &quot;raid&quot; of ten or more people 
forms, a second, traditional group split off and adventure on their own. </p>
<p>The Raid Leader determines the looting permissions for any NPC killed by the 
raid. There are three types of looting that the leader can choose from (though 
the Raid Leader can always loot NPCs killed by the raid). </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1. Only the raid leader can loot until the corpse opens up for all </p>
  <p>2. Only the raid leader and raid group leaders can loot until the corpse 
  opens up </p>
  <p>3. Raid leader chooses up to 9 other raid members that can loot until the 
  corpse opens up </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please note that altering loot permissions only applies to NPCs that are 
killed after changing this setting. See the command list below for more 
information about setting raid loot permissions. </p>
<p>When an item is looted by a raid member, a loot message is sent to all 
members of the raid. </p>
