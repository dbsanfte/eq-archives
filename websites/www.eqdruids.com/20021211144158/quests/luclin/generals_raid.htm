  <b><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">You say, 'Hail, General 
  Staginar' <br>
  <br>
  General Staginar says 'Greetings. Are you here to serve in the war against the 
  Grimling horde? <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'I will serve in the war' <br>
  <br>
  General Staginar says 'As you probably know, we've been battling the grunts 
  for nearly a generation now. They have proven to be a challenging opponent. 
  We've inflicted great casualties upon their kind in this war, yet somehow, 
  they seem to grow even more numerous. Barring some miracle, they will become a 
  serious threat to Shar Vahl very soon. One remaining strategy has a chance of 
  bringing us victory, but none have met the requirements for its 
  implementation. <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'What requirements?' <br>
  <br>
  General Staginar says 'Our intelligence has provided us with some information 
  about the enemy. They blindly follow a being they refer to as 'the master'. 
  Our high spiritists have sensed a powerful presence from the caverns beyond 
  our mines, but only those who possess a special key can venture there. None 
  who have obtained the key and ventured into the caverns have been seen alive 
  again. <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'What special key?' <br>
  <br>
  General Staginar says 'The grimling high commander holds half of a magical 
  acrylia obelisk that will transport the wielder to their master's stronghold. 
  I have slain the high commander who held the other half of the obelisk and I 
  have the knowledge of it's construction. I will only give it to one who has 
  proven to be a powerful soldier, for nothing less would stand a chance against 
  the enemy ruler. <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'What high commander' <br>
  <br>
  General Staginar says 'The grimling high commander will only appear if their 
  compound to the north is overrun. There are two encampments near the compound 
  that will need to be invaded as well in order to secure the area. It is a very 
  complex mission and I will only authorize you to lead it if you have 
  demonstrated competence. Serve our people by successfully completing the 
  lesser raids here in the forest. Bring me the Golden Medal of the Shar Vahl as 
  proof of your prowess, or, if you are already at least as powerful as I am, 
  there is another test that will give me confidence in your abilities. <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'What test' <br>
  <br>
  General Staginar says 'If you are less experienced than I am, performing this 
  task will gain you nothing. With that in mind, take this box and venture 
  through the mines and into the caverns. Combine in it Gooplart's tooth, 
  Gizgargank's scalp, Grikplag's skull, Gnildaria's eye, Gnerpokkel's heart, 
  Gilgaplank's toes, the husk of the summoned burrower, and the shackles of a 
  Vah Shir captive. Return to me with the Box of the Hero of Shar Vahl and I 
  will send a team of our veterans to escort you into battle. <br>
  <br>
  You get a Box of the General's Challenge (7 slot container) <br>
  <br>
  This is the &quot;short circuit&quot; quest, for higher level players who do not wish to 
  complete the series of raids which comprise the Grimling War in Grimling 
  Forest. By retrieving these items from the named Grimlings inside Acrylia you 
  prove your strength in return for continuing to the portion of the quest which 
  takes up in Acrylia Caverns</span></b><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
