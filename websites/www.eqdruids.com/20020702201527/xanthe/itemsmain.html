<b>This page contains</b> all of the useful items that can be made with one trade skill and are used in another (all the ones mentioned in the guides anyway, I might have missed some).<p>

For ease of navigation I have listed the items in 3 ways:<p>

<a href="madeby.html">Made By...</a> The trade by which they are made.<p>

<a href="usedby.html">Used By...</a> The trade in which they are used.<p>

<a href="alphalist.html">Alphabetical Order</a> Alphabetical order of items.<p><br>

For instance, if you were looking for how to make Metal Bits, you could either go to “M” in the Alphabetical list, or you could look under Smithing in the “Made by” list.<p>
Or if you wanted to see which items you might need to get if you were taking up Baking, you could look at the Baking section of the “Used by” list.<p>

Because of the volume of data in these pages, they may take a while to load, and will probably look a bit untidy, but tables in html were never my specialty so you’ll just have to wade through the best you can.<p>If you see anything incorrect or missing, please drop me a line at shadowknight57@yahoo.com and I will gladly set it right straight away!
