<p>Hail Fellow Druids.</p>
<p>During my travels through Norrath, I have discovered a nice little way to get
rapid experience. I have seen few others use this technique, and the ones that
see me use it often wonder why they didn't think of it themselves. So for those
of you unfamiliar with this method, I would like to share it with you.</p>
<p>At lvl 34, druids get this wonderful little spell called LIGHTNING STRIKE.
It's an area effect spell that does 184 pts of damage, hitting up to 4 targets
MAXIMUM at once. This is a wonderful time saver, as you have already gone
through the first hell lvl at level 30, and at 35 you are on your second one,
3rd at 40, and the ever popular, &quot;This lvl makes me want to quit the
game&quot;, at 45.</p>
<p>The key to using this spell effectively is making sure that all of the
targets are grouped fairly close together. This is rather simple to do if you
remain patient and don't get to cocky. Here are some of the various ways i have
experimented doing this....</p>
<p>1) Assuming the targets are side by side, harmony them and pull one with
snare. Get him far enough away from the other so you can go back to the one
still sitting there and then pull him with snare. Then run circles around them
both until they are close together, then kite away.</p>
<p>2) Say you have a target at 9:00 and 3:00. Get within casting distance of
both if possible. Target the first and pull with snare. Then turn and do the
same with the second. As they advance on you, slowly walk backwards keeping them
and yourself in a &quot;V&quot; type formation. With them at the tips of the
&quot;V&quot; and you at the intersection where the lines meet. As they draw
closer to you they will close the distance between themselves. Once they are
close enough together, Kite away.</p>
<p>3) This is another good way. Especially for those who may not have enough
mana to kite more than one mob efficiently. (Best used with the &quot;V&quot;
formation example above) Once you have meditated to full, cast regenerate on
yourself. Then med back up to full mana. Then cast your second damage shield on
yourself. *always keep the self only version buff on*) then either med to full
again, or pull if you are ready. Let both targets close in on you and hit you a
couple of times. This has 2 advantages. a) Gets both targets side by side. b)
Does a little bit of damage to each that may save you having to cast a last DD
spell on them.</p>
<p>There are lots of other ways to do this. You should experiment and find
whatever method works best for you. Also, I believe it goes without saying that
this only works outdoors for the most room for kiting. Not to mention that
Lightning Strike is an outdoor only spell.</p>
<p>I have used this on only a couple of different mobs. Gnolls outside of
Splitpaw, Cyclops, Hill Giants, and various Guards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some things to keep in mind using this method...</p>
<p>* Always keep the targets close together. IF they get separated during the
fight, stand directly in the center of the 2 and slowly back away as the get
closer. this will draw them back together. If you are kiting more than 2 and
this happens, draw 2 of them together, the repeat the process above to get the
3rd back in the group.</p>
<p>* Lightning Strike takes a lot of mana to cast, and is not really mana efficient
for the damage it does. For best mana \ damage efficiency you will need 3 or
more targets.</p>
<p>* Before you get all gung ho and go trying to kill 4 mobs at once, try this
out on a single target first. See how much mana it will take you to kill it, and
how much you have left over. IF you have to med to much during the battle, it
might be best to wait for your next lvl, or until you get another good WIS
increasing item.</p>
<p>* Also keep in mind that just because you can kill 2 at a time, does not mean
that you can take 3 or 4 effectively. Because of the low damage of the spell, it
takes longer to kill, and you will most probably have to resnare each target
during battle. (I usually do this at 1\2 mana just to be safe) You also have to
factor in resists. If more than 1 target resists a large portion of the damage,
or resists a blast completely, this could lead to problems when going to finish
them off.</p>
<p>* This style of kiting is not very suitable for Tag Team kiting. It's
efficiency is based on keeping the targets together. With someone helping you or
healing you in battle, this may distract one of the targets and end up splitting
them up. Forcing the one assisting you to keep right by your side for the
possibly the rest of the battle. Causing him to get in the way of retargeting
the mobs for you to resnare, etc....</p>
<p>* This spell also has a casting time of 4.5 seconds. So you need plenty of
distance to cast it. I have found that running as soon as the casting meter disappears,
until the spell icon resets for another cast, is enough time to get the distance
you need.</p>
<p>* Because of the time needed to cast the spell, and the distance needed to
cast it safely, it's a good idea to resnare each of the mobs you are kiting once
you get to 1\2 mana during the fight.</p>
<p>The spell line up I primarily use is as follows.</p>
<p>Greater healing Regeneration Shield of brambles Lightning strike Combust (or
firestrike when you get it) Careless Lightning (keep them handy for finishing
off the mobs if they don't all die at once.) Drones of Doom or Drifting death
(if the last one standing is stunned you can DOT and med while he dies) Snare
(gate is also another one to mem if this method is new or very tricky for you to
do.<br>
