I am Drenic Garrison, Governor of Science here in Katta Castellum. I am currently involved in several scientific endeavors with the other governors and am in need of assistance supplying my researchers with the proper [materials and samples] for their studies. <br> <br> You say, 'what materials and samples?' <br> <br> Drenic Garrison says 'The Magus Conlegium are assisting with some studies on the physiology of the Vampyres of the Coterie of the Eternal Night and are in need of [ash and blood] samples. Maralicis Dilsm our Governor of Health is assisting in research on [counteragents] to the venom and diseases native to Luclin. Finally, there have been reports from the agents of Erikal Wolfeye that there is a civilization of [snake people] that live on the furthest reaches of the light side of Luclin in a region devoid of atmosphere. <br> <br> You say, 'snake people?' <br> <br> Drenic Garrison says 'To the west beyond the Twilight Sea is an airless <br> grey region between the light and dark sides of Luclin. Some time ago our&nbsp; scouts cooperating with powerful members of the Magus Conlegium attempted to chart the expanses of the barren treacherous region. During this excursion the scouts and magi encountered a small group of strange snake like men. The magi detected no magical aid that was allowing the creatures to move freely in the airless void without danger of suffocation. When approached the snake men quickly fled. We wish to know how these creatures survive in such conditions. If they prove to be a hostile species then we will have to resort to examining their [anatomy].</p><p>You say, 'what anatomy?' <br> <br> Drenic Garrison says 'I wish to examine the lungs or whatever breathing <br> organs these creature have. It would not be prudent to hunt and kill a <br> living member of this species and society we know practically nothing about but there are several undead snake men in the region as well. I will require three such organs however to perform the proper experiments. <br> <br> The snakes are Shissar Stalkers. They occasionally drop an organ. Bring back three for your reward. Found in the the Grey. <br> <br> Bring ya fish scales as there is no air in this zone.<br> <br> <b>Amulet of the Grey Wastes</b></p><p><font size=2>LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP&nbsp; </font><br> Sta: +10 Magic Resist: +4 Cold Resist: +4&nbsp; <br> Weight: 0.1 <br> Classes: All Classes&nbsp; <br> Races: All Races&nbsp; <br> Inventory Slot: Neck<br> Effect: Enduring Breath <br> Type: Permanent <br> Charges: Unlimited <br> &nbsp;<p><a href=katta.htm>Back</a></td></tr></table></center></div></td></tr></table><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td><p align=center style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size=1>All information contained on this website copyright Thistlethorne Enterprises 2001-2002.&nbsp; Everquest copyright Sony Inc.</font></p></td></tr></table><!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table><!--msnavigation--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td><p align=center style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size=1>All information contained on this website copyright Thistlethorne Enterprises 2001-2002.&nbsp; Everquest copyright Sony Inc.</font></p></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table></body></html>
