    Nobility</font></b></p>
    <p>You must have completed the first 4 Qeynos Badges to be able to continue 
    with this quest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
    <font face="Arial">You say, 'Hail, Sergeant Caelin' <br>
    <br>
    Sergeant Caelin says 'Hail. You have nothing to fear from the gnolls. My men 
    and I have been sent from Qeynos to help defend Fort Jaggedpine should those 
    worthless curs make the mistake of assuming this will be a place of easy 
    plunder. I've fought and slain scores of gnolls in my time. Were I not bound 
    to my post here I would go forth and drive them from their dark cave to the 
    north myself. However, I can offer you a [bounty], should you choose to take 
    such a mission upon yourself.' <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'what bounty' <br>
    <br>
    Sergeant Caelin says 'If you choose to go and fight against the gnolls, I 
    shall offer a bounty for every gnoll canine that you return to me. You look 
    a bit more adventurous then many of those that live in this settlement. They 
    seem a bit [docile].' <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'who is docile' <br>
    <br>
    Sergeant Caelin says 'Perhaps it comes from living in harmony with nature 
    for an extended period of time but they are more concerned with trading food 
    recipes and doing arts and crafts. I have offered to give them some basic 
    training in the arts of war but they seem to have no interest. This is a 
    dangerous world in which we live and failure to acknowledge that has meant 
    the downfall of many a society. I won't let this happen on my watch, 
    provided my [men] are on their toes.' <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'What men' <br>
    <br>
    Sergeant Caelin says 'Guard Bossamir is a model soldier and a good man. I'm 
    happy to have him watching my back. That Finewine character however, he is 
    not worth the cost of the sword he wields! All he does is whine and 
    complain. He was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and his family 
    enrolled him in the guard to teach him some discipline but I've had no luck 
    with him. He hasn't even turned in a [shift report] for weeks. Captain 
    Tillin will bust me down to private if I don't deliver those soon.' <br>
    <br>
    ***Kills Gnolls and turn in Gnolls fangs otherwise Sergeant Caelin will just 
    say &quot;you have not proved yourself worth to our cause&quot;. You need to be at 
    least amiable to him. when you are...*** <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'what shift report' <br>
    <br>
    Sergeant Caelin says 'You have been helpful in our defense efforts. However, 
    I can not be too careful about whom I trust with carrying this information. 
    If you truly consider yourself an ally to Qeynos then no doubt you have 
    assisted the city in its defense before. Show me your Qeynos Badge of Honor 
    and I'll know I can trust you fully. I'll place my mark upon it should 
    anyone question your authority to do this service for me.' <br>
    <br>
    ***hand him your Qeynos badge of Honor and you will receive &quot;Marked Qeynos 
    Badge of Honor&quot; in return along with &quot;A warning note/report&quot; to give to 
    Guard Finewine. Sorry I don't have the dialogue for that but trust me*** <br>
    <br>
    *to your right and within eye site is Guard Finewine. He is standing by the 
    other house back entrance* <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'Hail, Guard Finewine' <br>
    <br>
    Guard Finewine says 'Yeah. Hi. Lovely place this. Humid, dark, wild animals 
    all over the place, man eating plants, snakes and bugs finding their way 
    into my armor and biting me where a man ought not be bit. And if [Bossamir] 
    is right, we're soon to be cut down by ravaging gnolls. Why-oh-why did I get 
    assigned to this job? Why wasn't I assigned to Qeynos where a man can get a 
    decent meal and sleep in a nice bed at night? Oh I'm sorry. Did I say that 
    out loud?' <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'What Bossamir' <br>
    <br>
    Guard Finewine says 'Hmm. . . Yeah, I have this tendency to prattle on when 
    I'm completely miserable. According to what my colleague Bossamir has heard, 
    these gnolls may be tougher then we thought. But that would be par for the 
    course anyway with the way my pitiful life is going. Woe is me. The people 
    in this backward settlement hate me, Sergeant Caelin hates me and I assume 
    Kane hates me too because he sent me to the armpit of Antonica on a suicide 
    mission.' <br>
    <br>
    *gave him the Warning letter/note* <br>
    <br>
    Guard Finewine says 'So he wants to send me to jail simply because I'm not 
    filling out some silly reports? How can I be expected to think in such a 
    decrepit state? Maybe you could help me. If I had a meal worthy of someone 
    of my breeding then maybe I could think. Bring me something elegant, I don't 
    want anything dull and pedestrian. I don't know what I want though. Do you 
    have any suggestions?' <br>
    <br>
    Guard Finewine wants some dryad, Potameid pate first before he will part 
    with the report. Finewine then says he wants panther pate and will give you 
    a no drop brandy for the dryad/Potameid pate. <br>
    <br>
    --Dryad, Potameid pate <br>
    -First you need Dryad meat (which will lower your faction with Dryads and 
    they are everywhere in this zone) or Potameid meat (trivial 151) <br>
    -foraged plant shoots <br>
    -brandy <br>
    -spices <br>
    -combine in an oven or spit which will result in a +4 wisdom banquet meal 
    for the dryad recipe and +4 intelligence banquet meal for the Potameid</font> 
    recipe. <br>
    <br>
    ---panther pate <br>
    -no drop panther liver from JP panthers <br>
    -foraged plant shoots <br>
    -no drop brandy from guard (see above) <br>
    -spices <br>
    -combine in an oven or spit </p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>

    panther pate and you'll receive the shift report. Hand the report to Caelin
