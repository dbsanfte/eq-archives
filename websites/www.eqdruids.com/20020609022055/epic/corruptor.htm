<p align="center"><font face="Antigoni Med" color="#FF0000">Make sure when you start this part
of the quest you have your group ready and waiting at (Neg 1500 Neg 1000).</font></p>
<p align="left">All of the following druids can be found near the south river in
East Karana but might not all show up on track from the spot where you start
which is Athele.&nbsp; I have also seen these folks walk to meet the others
where you can hand them the item at that time but I would not rely on them
coming to you.</p>
<p align="left">1. Find <b>Athele</b> in East Karana.&nbsp; She will be located
near the river just west of the barbarian fisher village.&nbsp; Give her the
coin and recieve this amulet:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="braided-grass.jpg" width="329" height="138"></p>
<p align="left">2. Find <b>Sionae</b> in East Karana.&nbsp; He can be found
around -2300, -930 but starts walking to the Athele sometimes after he
spawns.&nbsp; Hand him the amulet
and you will recieve this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="frayed-grass.jpg" width="321" height="135"></p>
<p align="left">3. Find <b> Nuien</b> in East Karana.&nbsp; He can be found
around -3650, -300 but also has a tendency to wander to the gathering that is
taking place at Athele.&nbsp; Hand him the item and you
will recieve the same item back:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="frayed-grass.jpg" width="321" height="135"></p>
<p align="left">4. Find <b> Teloa</b> in East Karana.&nbsp; She spawns somewhere
around -3800, -2860.&nbsp; Hand her the item and you
will recieve nothing but she will begin walking to the other NPCs which you have
already triggered.&nbsp; At this point you can gate back to your group waiting
at the location given at the top of this page.&nbsp; Wait for the DE corrupter and 2 darelf reavers to
spawn which will take place within a minute.</p>
<p align="left">The reavers will start running to the druids and the corrupter
will despawn within 20 seconds if not attacked.&nbsp; Kill him fast and loot his
corpse before the reavers kill the druids.&nbsp; When the last druid dies the
reavers will shout out what they have done and then despawn themselves and the
corruptor.&nbsp; Even if you have already killed the corrupter the CORPSE will
despawn as well, so loot quickly.</p>
<p align="left">You will loot this off of the Dark Elf Corruptor:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="fleshbound.jpg" width="323" height="141"></p>
<p align="left">5. Return to the zone in one hour and hand the tome to <b> Athele</b> to
recieve the earthstained note:</p>
