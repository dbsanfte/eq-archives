                <span class="newsstory"> Combines work again!<br>
                Melee Part II!<br>
                A new story has been added to your storybook!</span></p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory"><br>
                The grammar police have invaded EQ and they have made many minor 
                spell, item and quest text fixes that are too numerous to list 
                here. </p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory">We'd like to thank all of the 
                players that took time to provide feedback regarding the melee 
                changes. We'd also like to send a special thanks to all of the 
                players that helped us test the additions on the Test and Beta 
                servers. All of the input we received helped to shape the improvements 
                you've seen in the melee classes.<br>
                <br>
                Please continue to give your feedback on the melee system or anything 
                else that you feel requires attention. It does make a difference.</p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory">Over the last several months there 
                have been several new additions to EverQuest aimed at increasing 
                the desirability and relative power of pure melee classes.</p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory">- Discipline timers were revamped, 
                allowing greater freedom and frequency of use.<br>
                - Endurance bar was added as a limited resource to power melee 
                abilities and disciplines.<br>
                - Warriors received an innate 5 percent increase in their ability 
                to absorb damage.<br>
                - Warriors received the Incite line of abilities, giving them 
                a new tool for aggro management. <br>
                - Monks received the Phantom Call line of abilities, giving them 
                a new tool for pulling.<br>
                - Several new disciplines were introduced for all three classes.</p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory">The endurance system and the separation 
                of the discipline timers have provided us with new tools to add 
                interesting and powerful abilities in the future for melee classes. 
                You can count on seeing new disciplines and abilities as the game 
                progresses and as situations arise that require new abilities 
                to effectively balance class power. We will continue to evaluate 
                the melee system for both balance and enjoyment.</p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory">We will also continue to review 
                and make changes to each individual class as needed. Class balance 
                is an important part of any multiplayer game and requires constant 
                attention.</p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory">Thanks for helping make EverQuest 
                a great game.</p>

                Items<br>
                ------------------------<br>
                We have replaced the spell-like effects on items which produced 
                the following effects: Attack, HP Regen, Mana Regen, Haste and 
                Damage Shield with actual statistics. The effects on the item 
                have not changed they are just set up in a new way that we hope 
                will allow for more item functionality in the future.<br>
                Several Gates smithed weapons have had their damage and delay 
                adjusted to be more in line with the difficulty in crafting them.<br>
                The Copper Hammer of Striking will no longer proc for wielders 
                below level 50.<br>
                The Wailing Coral Staff is now two handed blunt.<br>
                Bolas are now one-handed projectile rather than ammo.<br>
                Bola ranges have been adjusted slightly.<br>
                All bolas that can proc will now do so.<br>
                All items that had the &quot;Cleave&quot; series of effects removed, 
                have had them returned.</p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory">The drop rate for the following 
                Epic Quest items has been increased slightly:</p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory">- Essence of a Vampire<br>
                - Decrepit Hide<br>
                - Staff of Elemental Mastery (earth)</p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory"><br>
                Expedition zones<br>
                -------------------------<br>
                You will now have to wait 5 minutes before you are able to accept 
                another expedition zone.</p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory"><br>
                Tradeskills<br>
                -------------------------<br>
                In order to correct many of the issues with the new tradeskill 
                interface it was necessary to remove all learned and favorite 
                recipes. However the system should now work better overall.<br>
                The sell prices for Saltwater Tuna and Saltwater crab, as well 
                as the price for any item made from them, have been reduced.<br>
                Rainbow Trout should now be tradeable.<br>
                If you are not a gnome, you should no longer be able to tinker 
                with a deluxe toolkit kit. If you are a gnome, please tinker away.<br>
                You should now be able to properly search for recipes.<br>
                The trivial level for brewing Fish Wine has been adjusted.</p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory"><br>
                Berserkers<br>
                -------------------------<br>
                Some berserker abilities have had their endurance cost changed.<br>
                The duration of Confusing Strike has been reduced.<br>
                Berserkers should no longer be told that they can bash at level 
                6. <br>
                The berserker guildmaster in the Plane of Knowledge has been taught 
                throwing and parry and is ready to train berserkers in their use.</p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory"><br>
                Spells<br>
                -------------------------<br>
                Some Gates of Discord spells should now drop a little more often.<br>
                Several heal spells for Gates of Discord have been modified slightly.<br>
                The shadow knight Ancient Spell: Bite of Chaos should now work 
                as intended.</p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory"><br>
                NPC's<br>
                -------------------------<br>
                Hierophant Granix should now give the correct text in Cabilis.<br>
                Trimdet Trueheart in Abysmal Sea is less of a snob and should 
                now speak with you correctly. <br>
                If you tell Brevik Kalaner in Abysmal what items you [need back], 
                he will return to you any items you've just given him.</p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory"><br>
                Tribute<br>
                -------------------------<br>
                A few items have had their tribute value adjusted.<br>
                Gift of the Enchanters should now work correctly.<br>
                You should no longer be able to donate containers with items inside 
                for favor.<br>
                Persistent Boon should now give the proper effect.</p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory"><br>
                Alternate Advancement<br>
                -------------------------<br>
                Dire Charm will no longer reset after being resisted as the ability 
                was successfully initiated.<br>
                Dire Charm should now reset when used on an NPC that is too high 
                in level.</p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory"><br>
                Miscellaneous<br>
                -------------------------<br>
                Corrected a faction issue with the wizard epic.<br>
                The monk &quot;Phantom&quot; line of abilities should no longer 
                be resisted in the level 65 &quot;hard&quot; LDoN Adventures.<br>
                The rogue's &quot;Assassin's Strike&quot; skill line ability will 
                be re-introduced with the next update.<br>
                The Shining Bloodstone will now be restricted to 2-handed weapons. 
                Any who have placed this augmentation in a 1-handed weapon will 
                find the augmentation on their cursor when they log in. If you 
                find that you have no practical use for the 2-handed augmentation, 
                please petition and a suitable 1-handed replacement will be made 
                available to you.</p>

                from the Executive Director of Customer Service</strong></span><br>
                <span class="newsstory">So, how's the CS dept going over at SOE 
                anyways. Well I found this letter on the EQ message boards that 
                had a little insight!</span></p>
              <p align="left"><span class="newsstory">Greetings,<br>
                My name is D. Scott Mattson and I am the Executive Director of 
                Customer Service for Sony Online Entertainment. I have 15 years 
                experience in the Customer Service industry with an emphasis on 
                Call Center Management in the high tech arena. Before coming to 
                Sony Online Entertainment I worked as Director of Player Relations 
                and Product Management for the Electronic Arts Company. I had 
                the pleasure of launching multiple MMOG titles at EA as well as 
                managing the day-to day operations of the in game staff of all 
                the online game titles for EA. I am thrilled to be at Sony Online 
                Entertainment and wanted to communicate to you the many new improvements 
                that we will be providing to our customers to enhance our quality, 
                streamline our operations and improve our response times. Please 
                let me have your attention for a few moments to outline these 
                improvements.</span></p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory">First, we have been working on 
                our knowledge base for the past few weeks so that we can establish 
                a solid foundation for our Tier 0 support (Tier 0 support is where 
                the customer can run a query to find their own answer). As we 
                are finding that people are familiarizing themselves with search 
                engines, we feel that our knowledge base is a user friendly tool 
                for our customers to seek answers on their own. We have recently 
                completed a full audit of solutions for all of our games, so any 
                solution that you find should be up to date. Of course there will 
                be situations where you will not find your answer, this is where 
                you can help us make our database be the best it can be by letting 
                us know that we need to add a solution or make a modification 
                to an existing FAQ. We feel strongly that the knowledge base will 
                be the cornerstone of our service and as such we will focus resources 
                there in partnership with you, the customer. Of course there will 
                be cases where you will need to contact a Customer Service Representative, 
                but we are confident that the majority of your answers can be 
                resolved through our knowledge base. Currently, you will find 
                our knowledge base at our website and inside Star Wars Galaxies 
                through the Holocron interface. Our plan is to implement access 
                to our knowledge base inside the game client for all of our online 
                products. By doing this, we are confident that the majority of 
                your questions will be answered immediately rather than waiting 
                for a CSR to respond.</p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory">Secondly, we have expanded our 
                support into other areas in the world. The United Kingdom has 
                been providing support for all of games for the past few months 
                as well as outsource partners in India. This has helped us immensely 
                during the off-peak hours, holidays and during regular business 
                hours. With their support, we are able to provide a much more 
                robust service around the clock utilizing a “follow the sun” support 
                model.</p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory">Finally, we are actively improving 
                our current tools to respond to our customers quickly and effectively. 
                We understand that it could take some time to receive a response 
                to your petition, so we are enhancing our petitioning tool to 
                make it easier to respond to our customers quickly. As we integrate 
                better tools to help our customers, the response rate to your 
                questions should significantly decrease.</p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory">These are just a few of the high 
                level enhancements we are making to our In-game Customer Service 
                to make your experience a better one. Thank you for your patience 
                now and in the future as we work hard to offer better and improved 
                service.</p>

              <p align="left"><span class="newstitle"><strong><em></em>Server 
                Stability Issues</strong></span><br>
                <span class="newsstory">The EQ team apologizes for the server 
                instability in the past week. This instability occurs at peak 
                times, and is seen to our users as &quot;1017&quot; errors. Normally 
                within a few minutes these users are able to log back in, but 
                on some servers this problem has occurred more than once in a 
                single evening. </span></p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory">We're working to address the problem, 
                and expect that in the next couple of days we'll have everything 
                resolved. In the meantime, there's a chance you'll run into this 
                problem if you're on a crowded server during peak times - if you 
                do, you can normally get back onto the servers within 15 or 20 
                minutes.</p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory">For those of you who want to know 
                more, read on.</p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory">Gates of Discord has been immensely 
                popular - many of our old customers have been coming back to try 
                it out, and many new customers have arrived to give EQ a try. 
                Our simultaneous usage numbers are quite high, but in addition 
                the people who are online are also playing more and for longer 
                than usual. Gates of Discord introduced many new instanced zones, 
                high level content, and re-introduced the casino - this type of 
                content is particularly taxing on our servers, and coupled with 
                the unusually high usage, we're seeing a resulting instability 
                during our peak times.</p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory">Our first effort was to remove 
                the casino, which improved our server stability. Since then, we've 
                been working on two different fixes, the first of which will go 
                live at the 3am patch Wednesday morning (Tuesday night). The second 
                will be later this week. Both of them are meant to improve performance 
                during peak times and address the 1017 errors that you may be 
                experiencing. Each of them we expect to be an improvement on connectivity, 
                and we expect our second fix to resolve the problems.</p>
              <p align="left" class="newsstory">We apologize for our service instability 
                in the past week; we're working hard on this problem - it's cutting 
                into our play time too. :) </p>
              <p align="left"><span class="newsstory">We'll give you another update 
                in the next day or two as we make progress, and let you know how 
                things are coming. </span></p>
