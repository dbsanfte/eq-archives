  <p align=center><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">Jagged Pine Armor - 
  Sleeves</font></b></p><p><font face="Arial">You say, 'I wish to acquire 
  sleeves' <br>
  <br>
  Cheyloh Greenwood says 'If that is your wish, my friend. You will need to seek 
  out two items and return them to me. In the depths of the Potameid caves 
  located off of the Hatchling River, you will find the Potameid Protectors. Our 
  ranger scouts have found many of our sacred jade ornaments scattered 
  throughout the possession of the Potameides. Reports stating that the 
  protectors to hold the Polished Jade Leaves, which you must acquire for the 
  sleeves, have been delivered by our scouts. The second item that you must 
  return to me are the Shark Tooth Sleeves. Seek out Lerian Wyndrunner in 
  Surefall Glade and he will guide you in that task.'' <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what are shark tooth sleeves?' <br>
  <br>
  Lerian Wyndrunner says 'You seek to prove yourself upon the ancient and sacred 
  path of the Jaggedpine, I see. You will need to procure two specific items for 
  me so that I might make one of the components that you will need to produce 
  the sleeves. Yes, my, friend, you will be making the final product with your 
  own hands and patience, as is the ultimate test of this path -- to prove that 
  you are willing and able to earn these items on your own accord. The items I 
  need to make the Reinforced Rawhide Sleeves are a Shark Rib from one of the 
  great behemoths of Kedge, and a Flayed Panther Hide. The hide you will find 
  upon one of the poachers that have taken it upon themselves to establish an 
  outpost in our forest. The one you will find to have such hide within their 
  possession is Yranik Blackguard.' <br>
  <br>
  Handing Lerian the shark rib and the flayed panther hide results in: <br>
  <br>
  Reinforced Rawhide Sleeves. 6ac, 10hp. <br>
  <br>
  Lerian Wyndrunner says ''inspects the rib and the hide, checking for 
  imperfections that might disable him from completing his work. Satisfied with 
  the quality of the components, Lerian places the rib in the center of the 
  hide, which is draped over his arm. He then begins to speak softly in an 
  ancient, druidic tongue that is foreign to your ears and knowledge. As he 
  speaks, the black fur of the hide seems to pierce the cartilage shark rib, 
  binding it in-place. The rest of the hide folds back, wrapping itself around 
  the druid's arm. Lerian then completes his chant and removes the Reinforced 
  Rawhide Sleeves from his arm and offers it to Aldreaath, 'There is [more that 
  you must do], my friend, before this task is complete.'' <br>
  Your faction standing with Residents of Jaggedpine got better. <br>
  <br>
  Your faction standing with Jaggedpine Treefolk got better. <br>
  Your faction standing with Protectors of Pine got better. <br>
  Your faction standing with Guards of Qeynos got better. <br>
  You gain experience!! <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what more must I do?' <br>
  <br>
  Lerian Wyndrunner says 'Return to Kedge and find two Discarded Shark Teeth. 
  These teeth you will likely find at the bottom of the oceanic ruins and need 
  not interfere with the corrupted, coerced slaves of Phinagel to acquire the 
  teeth. Yes, we know of Phinagel and the gruesome legend that surrounds him -- 
  remember, he is indeed very old and his 'accomplishments' with the Kedge race 
  happened long before the Jaggedpine borders were sealed off. We are not 
  entirely ignorant to the outside world -- it is just the modern times that 
  have become a bit of a mystery. Once you have acquired the teeth, you will 
  need to sew them onto the reinforced sleeves that I have just given you. Be 
  sure you hold a master's eye in the art of tailoring when attempting this 
  feat, for the thread is very thin and will break at the touch of an armature's 
  attempt.'' <br>
