  The Unkempt Warders Vol. IV</strong><br>
  <br>
  Wegadas would find several mates in his lifetime among the human tribe and be 
  father to over a dozen children - half elven children. The last of his 
  children and only daughter would be named Elaryness.<br>
  <br>
  Shortly after the birth of his final child, nearly four centuries after 
  establishing the Writ of the Wild and guiding his brethren through their 
  newfound ways, Wegadas was old and weary and heard the distinct call of the 
  forest - beckoning him to fulfill his own cycle of life. The old druid would 
  pass into the wilderness forever at a site that would later become the most 
  sacred site of the unkempt tribe.<br>
  <br>
  Wegadas' body was not buried, nor was it touched by the wild creatures of the 
  forest. He is said to have melded into the earth, and from his reclaimed flesh 
  and spirit, a great willow grew - the Weeping Willow of Tunare. The ancient 
  tales of the human tribe would say that the willow was a gift to Wegadas' 
  children and brethren from Tunare herself. As she reclaimed his old spirit, 
  the Mother of All felt the great loss that the unkempt tribe suffered with 
  Wegadas' passing and listened to their wordless prayer as they said their 
  farewells to the beloved leader. In her appreciation for the human tribe's 
  devotion to her and in honor of her missionary, Wegadas, she molded his spirit 
  and essence into the great, beautiful willow that eternally weeps the tears of 
  joy and sorrow of the tribe.<br>
  <br>
  With her father's passing and the appearance of the great willow, Elaryness, 
  the only daughter of Wegadas, would rightfully challenge four others - two of 
  whom were her half-brothers - who had made the declaration for leadership in 
  Wegadas' stead. The brutal, ceremonial battles would last days at a time, 
  where those who vied for leadership would hunt one another throughout the 
  whole expanse of the woods. Elaryness would destroy her challengers and the 
  tribe, now beneath her rule, would move their bodies to the very location 
  where Wegadas himself had laid to final rest. These brutal and oftentimes 
  savage hunts (dictated by the hunters' primordial instincts) are law amongst 
  the Unkempt Warders, for it is the law of the wild - the strongest lead whilst 
  the weakest follow, though none are whole without the other.<br>
  <br>
  Elaryness would be declared the first Hierophant of the Unkempt Warders. It 
  was also Elaryness who would establish the Shrine of Tunare, in memory of her 
  father and to fulfill the debt that she felt her entire tribe owed to the 
  Mother of All for her gift of Wegadas, and the weeping willow. </font></p>
