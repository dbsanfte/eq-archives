<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">I write this summary in the hopes that it will aid
  you in your fight with<br>
  Faydedar. I do not claim that this is the only way to battle him. I do<br>
  hope that my advice will help improve your odds of being successful when he<br>
  finally does spawn. I would also like to thank those that have done such
  notable work in the initial research of our epic quest.
  </div>
  <p>I have been involved with four fights with the elusive Faydedar, and this
  is<br>
  a compellation of what I have learned in those encounters. If you have not<br>
  yet printed yourself a map of Timorous Deep I strongly recommend you do<br>
  before going any farther. Next, I recommend that you have an
  &quot;assister&quot;<br>
  available who can help you on short notice. This person can be a fellow<br>
  druid, a bard or a ranger.
  <p>1) In every case the bait left at the spires at (approx) neg 12,200 pos<br>
  4,200 (or the druid waiting) has been attacked. It did not matter if the<br>
  person was levitated at the top or sitting at the water line, or which arm<br>
  of the spire s/he was sitting on.
  <p>2) To successfully kite Faydedar you need to have as much resist magic and<br>
  (secondary) resist fire gear on as you can muster. Next you should have 6<br>
  dummy buffs up, then RM, sow (or wolf form), and finally levitate. If you<br>
  are fortunate enough to have J-boots then put this buff up first and have it<br>
  hot keyed. Faydedar breathes an aoe debuff with fire and fear. Make sure<br>
  you are bound at the docks in Oasis.
  <p>3) If you are sitting there with your druid go to step 6.
  <p>4) Upon your bait dieing, pick up your assister and get to the succor in<br>
  point (the chessboard). Have the assister stand at the base of the hill<br>
  that the Iksar master is on. His job is to pick Faydedar up on tracking and<br>
  intercept him if you are unable to find him.
  <p>5) Look for Faydedar between the spires and the Raptor Islands. He travels<br>
  very slowly so if you start a grid pattern you should pick him up on track<br>
  in short order. If you fail to find him, no worries, your assister will<br>
  pick him up on track eventually at the Iksar master.
  <p>6) You now have Faydedar on track and in your sights. There is no need to<br>
  cast anything on him. He will agro on you as soon as he is in range of you.<br>
  Keep Faydedar on track at all times. This will tell you if you have out ran<br>
  him. (instead of being behind he'll start showing as behind left etc) The<br>
  chances are slim on this, but better to be safe then sorry. Lead (kite :P )<br>
  Faydedar to the elven island (neg 4,000, neg 6,000) This is a bit of a run<br>
  and takes a few minutes. You want to kite him there as there are only elves<br>
  on the island (non agro to you and Faydedar) and it has the largest open<br>
  area for kiting. Kite him only on the north-east side of the island in a<br>
  nice oval loop. At this point you only care about 2 of your buffs. Keep up<br>
  one dummy buff (something fast to cast like see invis) and either sow or<br>
  wolf form. If you are fortunate enough to have J-boots you don't need to<br>
  keep any buffs up. I have kited Faydedar in this manner for 7 hours with no<br>
  trouble and no de-spawn. (a fungi tunic also helps but is not necessary)
  <p>7) While you are kiting your &quot;assister&quot; should be sitting at the
  elven<br>
  docks. His job is to sit there and cover incase you die, go LD, crash or<br>
  what ever. If for some reason you don't have an &quot;assister&quot; and die,
  you are<br>
  bound at the docks in Oasis. Zone back in and egress (succor). I would<br>
  recommend leaving a /dueled corpse at the egress point with 8 stacks of bat<br>
  wings on it. This allows you to loot one stack of bat wings, re-levitate,<br>
  and go back to the spires - and back to step number four. (Twice after<br>
  dieing at the elven island (no comment about LD) Faydedar went back to the<br>
  spires before resuming his normal journey)
  <p>8) Fighting Faydedar: Do NOT be mislead that Faydedar is easy to kill. He<br>
  is tougher then Nagafen. Take at least five groups of people. Make sure<br>
  they are balanced and that you have some warriors 55 plus. I have seen<br>
  Faydedar wipe out 4 groups of people where half were lvl 55 plus and then<br>
  poof. I'm sure your guild is ub3r and l33t, but after spending X hundred<br>
  hours camping him, do you want to have him wipe you out because the casters<br>
  ping ponged him or something else stupid and poof?
  <p>9) Get your friends, guildmates and whoever else you can to the succor<br>
  point. The fastest way into Timorous Deep is via the barge in Oasis. Have<br>
  your party meet at the chessboard, form groups and buff. Their last buff<br>
  should be levitate/dmf. When they are fully buffed have them go due East to<br>
  neg 6,000 neg 6,000 and meet at the large stone eagle. It is easier for<br>
  them to move to you then for you, or someone with levitate to try and kite<br>
  him over to the chessboard. As well, if you fight at the chessboard and<br>
  loose he's 50 yards from the Iksar master L and you will have almost no<br>
  chance of a second try. If you do loose go back to step four.
  <p>There it is. I believe I've covered everything, though I'm sure someone<br>
  will add to this. I personally sat at the spires for 308 hours waiting for
  Faydedar. In all, I spent 418 hours before I was finally able to complete the
  druid epic quest, and receive my epic weapon. I have read others that
  completed it in a few days (cough), but would suggest that you can expect to
  spend some 'epic' time to complete this, probably<br>
  around 200 hours.
  <p>May Tunare guide you in your journey,
  <p>Feyn Windwalker<br>
