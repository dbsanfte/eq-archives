I developed this routine from watching higher level players and from reading posts about casting problems. I use the routine to prepare myself for the next level by spending time &quot;sharpening the sword&quot; for the battles to come. There can be a little bit of preliminary work to do, but most of it occurs after I hear the ice cream truck turn the corner and go &quot;Ding&quot;. I've adapted this routine over time, and will probably continue to do so. If you want to try it, be sure to change it to fit your requirements. I believe it is useful in whatever form it takes, and hope you find likewise.</p><center><table border=0 width=90%><tr><td><font size=2><u><b>Pre-Ding:</b></u><br> <br> If you're going to ding a level that gets new spells, try to start picking them up during the pre-ding level(s). This way, you can have them in inventory, and scribe, mem, and put them to use once you hear the ice cream truck. If you're fighting constantly against good mobs, the next level can sneak up on you. Although it can be a pleasant surprise, the pleasure can only be enhanced by opening your book and scribing those new spells. <br> <br> <u><b>Post-Ding:</b></u> <br> <br> OK, you've just dinged, the group has disbanded or you've finished soloing that last mob, the loot has been sold or banked, and the battles are over for a while. You head back to your home city (Rivervale for me) for a little R&amp;R. <ol><li>The first thing you do is pick up a fishing pole and a couple cans of bait from the shop behind the bank, and settle yourself in front of the water. After equipping the pole, unmem all your spells and mem the level 1 spells for each of the 5 classes: <b>Skin Like Wood</b> for Abjuration, <b>Minor Healing</b> for Alteration, <b>Dance of Fireflies</b> for Conjuration, <b>Sense Animals</b> for Divination, and <b>Burst of Flame</b> for Evocation.<br><br> (<u>Note:</u> Dance can only be cast at night; for daylight, load the lowest level Conjuration spell you have.) <br><br> As you level, add <b>Spirit of Wolf</b> (14) and <b>Bind Affinity</b> (14); although they are not part of the routine, people are always requesting them, and some even offer to pay.<br><br> <li>Next, set up your post-ding hot-keys. Start with <b>Sense Heading</b> and <b>Fishing</b>, and later add <b>Forage</b> (5) and <b>Track</b> (20). Open up an empty container and leave it open in your view. Target yourself with F1 and get started.<br><br> <li>If you have Forage, always click it first and whenever it cycles ready; it goes up VERY slowly. Click Fishing; it cycles the 2nd most slowly. If you have Track, click it next and immediately Cancel it; it cycles the 3rd most slowly, but it is only the initial click that counts towards the skill, so canceling doesn't hurt it. Immediately afterwards click Skin Like Wood. As soon as it cycles, click Sense Heading or Minor Healing. Make a game out of keeping as many things going at once as you can. Watch the chat window for numerical skill increases, including <b>Channeling</b> (4) while casting, and <b>Meditate</b> (8) while medding. <br><br> <u>Note</u>: at some point you are casting Burst of Flame on yourself. Although this is a level 1 spell, it can seriously damage or kill you at lower levels. You can reduce personal damage by buffing with Endure Fire(1) and your highest “Skin Like, and alternating with Minor Healing; or just wait and max your Evocation skill in the field.<br><br> <li>If you catch or forage something, drop it in the open container; a lot of the stuff will stack. If your rod breaks, you run out of bait, or you want to sell what you've caught so far, the shop is right there. If you are baking, use the fish for recipes (but see below); they are also edible as food right out of the river. If you are smithing, polish any rusty daggers you &quot;catch&quot; until they are trivial. Forage will occasionally turn up grubs, which can be used for bait. <br><br> <li>While you are at the water, you can work on your swimming skill. Although easier with <b>Enduring Breath</b> (9), you can still &quot;skill up&quot; without it. You can nuke or melee the fish you see; they will often drop multiple fish and fish scales. <br><br> <u>Note</u>: only &quot;fresh fish&quot;, not &quot;Rivervale Trout&quot; from RV, can be used for baking as far as I know, although both types stack, can be sold, and are edible in your inventory; you will occasionally get a &quot;fresh fish&quot; while swimming, but I have yet to catch a Rivervale trout while fishing; go figure. <br><br>In Rivervale, there are also piranha in the water; either be prepared to fight them, be ready to get out of the water, or at higher levels just ignore them. They drop a tooth, and in some cases a gem, both of which have various uses. Be sure to watch your yellow stamina bar, as swimming depletes it fairly quickly; a quick sit on the shore will restore it almost immediately.<br><br> <li>When you run out of mana, keep doing other non-casting skills while your mana recovers. Fishing and Sense Heading can be done while standing, sitting, or medding. Be sure to stand for Forage, or you'll waste a click until it recycles. Track closes your spell book if medding, but just open it back up, since it leaves you sitting. If you've gotten new spells, think about reorganizing your book while you're recovering mana. I have a buff section, a burn section, a crowd-control section, etc. I even keep all the level 1 spells listed above in their own section so I can quickly set up my routine.</ol> <br> With various exceptions, skills reach a maximum of <b>(Level + 1) X 5</b>, with each skill subject to various caps. For example, at level 10, each of the 7 casting-related skills (Abjuration, Alteration, Conjuration, Divination, Evocation, Channeling, Meditation) will max at (10 + 1) X 5 = 11 X 5 = 55. Once a skill reaches its max, no further increases are possible until you level, unless the cap has been reached. As soon as I max a casting skill, I unmem the spell gem, effectively crossing it off the list. Once you reach 101 in a skill, the Skills list under the Persona button will display the actual numerical value; 101 is also the level at which EQ considers you a &quot;Master&quot; of a skill. Until then, you will have to watch the chat window, or review your log file, to determine if you've increased or maxed a skill. <br></td></tr></table></center><br> <b>Results:</b><p>This routine has worked out very well for me. By maxing my casting skills, I have fewer fizzles and am better able to continue casting through mob interruptions. I make 4 gold a stack selling the fish I get while swimming or fishing. Since becoming trivial on fish fillets at 82, I even make a few plat profit selling the fillets I bake from the fish I catch. I keep a stack or 2 of fish scales for Enduring Breath. I'm trivial on polishing rusty daggers for Smithing. I now Forage much more successfully, and am starting to forage some interesting stuff. I have a much easier time navigating zones with Sense Heading at max. With Track, I can easily hunt down spiderlings and spiders for silk for tailoring.</p><b>To-do</b><br><p>I am going to expand my routine to include Bind Wound, and should have done so long ago. Bind Wound is available at level 1 with no training, i.e., just start doing it. As far as I can tell, you can't bind wounds, yourself or others, above 50 percent health, so don't even bother trying if health is above 50 percent. This means that you either need a wounded volunteer, or you have to volunteer yourself. In RV, there are a lot of wounded newbies in Misty who might be willing to stand still long enough for you to bind their wounds. The quickest way to volunteer yourself is to cast a damage spell on yourself until you drop below 50 percent health, then Bind Wound. This will be easier and use less mana if you remove your armor and any regen items first. If you want to save even more mana, climb something and jump off. Since either approach can lead to death, proceed with caution, especially if you’re low level, bound somewhere halfway across Norrath, or both.</p><b>Conclusion</b><br><p>If you already have a post-ding routine, I salute you as one who is dedicated to improvement. If you don't, consider using some of the ideas in here to create your own. Spend some time &quot;sharpening the sword&quot;, and you'll enjoy better luck in the battles to come. After all, Luck is when Preparation meets Opportunity.</p><p><a href=#Contents><font face Arial size=2>Back To Top</font></a></p></TD></TR><TR><TD><hr></TD></TR><TR><TD><br><a name=Addition><font size=5 color=008000 face=Arial> <b>Additional recommendations:</b></a></font><center><table border=0 width=90%><tr><td><font size=2 face=Arial><u><b>Practice areas:</b></u><p>When practicing your skills, it's generally a good idea to find an out-of-the-way spot, so you won't have to worry about running into unfriendly critters. Here are some recommended areas (there are more that aren't listed here):</p><ul><li>Rivervale (near the large body of water) <li>Qeynos South (along the docks) <li>Freeport East (along the docks) <li>Freeport West (under the Academy of Arcane Sciences) <li>North Ro (along the shore, near the barbarian huts) <li>Butcherblock Mountains (anywhere along the shore) <li>Dagnor's Cauldron (near the friendly NPC camp) <li>Surefall Glade (near the body of water surrounding the Ranger guild) <li>Highpass Hold (at the large body of water near the Tiger's Roar)</ul></td><tr><br><tr><td><font size=2 face=Arial><u><b>Bind Wound:</b></u> (This information was taken on the advice of a friendly rogue.)<p>The best place to practice your Bind Wound skill (outside of combat) is Lavastorm Mountains. When you are ready to practice, teleport into the zone and load up on bandages from the druid ring vendor. Then find a shallow pool of lava (the ones near the Nektulos Forest zone are ideal). Buff yourself with your highest skin spell, and your fire resistance buff (you'll take less damage than normal with a higher FR), and drop SoW/Wolf Form. Then go swimming.</p><p>Without any additional fire resistance, you will take 42 damage from the lava. With a FR of 35, I take 39 damage from lava. Because the damage you take is always the same, it's easy to gague when you need to stop and heal yourself. Wade into the lava, take some damage, and gague how much damage the lava does to you per round. Then take your total number of hitpoints, divide by two (or multiply by 50%), and divide that by the damage you took.</p><center><b>(max HP / 2) / (lava damage) = X </b><br></center><p>X will tell you the number of rounds of damage you can sustain from the lava before you have to get out.</p><p>When you are swimming, go deep enough so that you take damage, but not deep enough so that you can't get out immediately. I usually will start at the edge, and back myself into the lava. Once you begin taking damage, start counting off and hop out when you are sufficiently low on hitpoints.</p><p>Bind yourself back up to 50%, then repeat.</p><p>You can use this method at any time. And as long as you're careful, the risk is minimal.</p><p><u><b>Macros:</b></u><p>An efficient method of raising these skills is through the use of in-game macros.</p><p>For example, if you wanted to practice your fishing, sense heading, and two casting skills, you could set up a macro to do all of those with one press of a button. The commands needed would include <b>/doability</b>, <b>/cast</b>, and <b>/pause</b>. It would look something like the following:<ol> <li>/doability 1-10 (whatever ability slot you mapped fishing to) <li>/doability 1-10 (whatever ability slot you mapped sense heading to) <li>/cast 1 (first spell cast) <li>/pause 80 (8 second pause) <li>/cast 2 (second spell cast)</ol><p>You can use this method for each skill that you wished to practice.</p><p>For more detailed information about setting up macros for this, or any other in-game command, visit the <a href=http://www.eqguild.net/macros.html>macro page</a> at <a href=http://www.eqguild.net/><b>EQ Guild.net</b></a>.</p></td></tr></table><br><p align=left><a href=#Contents><font face Arial size=2>Back To Top</font></a></p></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></td></tr></table></center><p align=left><a href=../index.html>Return to Main</a></p></div></td></tr></table><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td><p align=center style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size=1>All information contained on this website copyright Thistlethorne Enterprises 2001-2002.&nbsp; Everquest copyright Sony Inc.</font></p></td></tr></table><!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table><!--msnavigation--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td><p align=center style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size=1>All information contained on this website copyright Thistlethorne Enterprises 2001-2002.&nbsp; Everquest copyright Sony Inc.</font></p></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table></body></html>
