  <font face="Arial">You can only do this quest with a single group. Completing 
  this quest (or any of the other trials) will give you access to the Plane of 
  Storms and the Plane of Valor <br>
  <br>
  Talk to Mavuin in the basement cellblock. Hail him and follow the dialogue. He 
  will ask you to plead his case before the Tribunal, agreeing will grant you a 
  character flag. <br>
  <br>
  Head to the area with The Tribunal, and ask them about Mavuin. Following the 
  dialog, saying &quot;I am prepared&quot; to each Tribunal will give you description of 
  the six trials.<br>
  <br>
  To do this one, say &quot;I am ready to begin the Trial of Lashing&quot;. Make sure you 
  are actually prepared when you say that because your group will be teleported 
  to the event area where you will only get a few seconds before things start.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial goes in four waves, with each wave coming about 40 seconds after the 
  last one, so if you aren't killing fast enough, expect to get three additional 
  sets of four mobs as adds. Each wave is exactly the same. There may be a final 
  encounter after killing the first four waves (never made it that far).<br>
  <br>
  Finishing this gives you the Mark of Lashing. <br>
  <br>
  Now talk to the Tribunal and say &quot;what evidence of Mauvuin&quot; and they will tell 
  you that they have consented to hear Mauvuin's case. Head back down and talk 
  to him and he will ask you to go see Karana and Mithaniel Marr. This will flag 
  you to be able to enter the Plane of Storms and and Plane Valor.</font></b></p>
