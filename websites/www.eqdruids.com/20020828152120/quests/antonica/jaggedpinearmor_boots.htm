  <p align=center><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">Jagged Pine Armor - 
  Boots</font></b></p><p><font face="Arial">You say, 'I wish to acquire boots'
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheyloh Greenwood says 'Then you shall endeavor to earn such a gift. I will 
  guide and aid you where I can, as will Lerian Wyndrunner, whom you may find in 
  Surefall Glade -- but it is you who will ultimately prove yourself worthy of 
  this item and the sacred oath that is tied to it -- the oath of the guardian 
  of nature. You must venture out into the world and procure several items that 
  you will eventually return to me. The items I require are two Polished Jade 
  Plates from the Potameid Guardians of the Hatchling River. Our rangers have 
  reported much of our recently stolen jade ornaments to be in the possession of 
  the Potameides -- the jade items likely came into their possession after they 
  killed the poachers who raid our fort here on occasion. Lerian will guide you 
  to acquire the second item if you approach and inquire to him about the 
  Mithril Fern Boots.'' <br>
  <br>
  Lerian Wyndrunner is in Surefall Glades, off to the right after leaving the 
  bear caves via the false wall behind the druid guild. <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what mithril fern boots?' <br>
  <br>
  Lerian Wyndrunner says 'Cheyloh has caught the attentions of yet another druid 
  seeking to prove themselves worthy of nature’s gifts. If she has placed her 
  trust and faith in you with this, one of our most sacred of tests and 
  equipment, then I shall guide and aid you in parallel to her faith, my friend. 
  I will need you to seek out and return to me some Shadowjade Fern Seeds, two 
  Shadowjade Fern Leaves, all of which you can forage from the Jaggedpine 
  forest, and a Jaggedpine Panther Hide. To obtain this hide, you will seek out 
  one known as Fitorrin Bladespur. The citizens of Qeynos have reported that he 
  has taken a ship to Odus. As he is a criminal, Erudin may have already 
  disposed of him, but that is unlikely for Fitorrin is well informed and 
  education on the ways of the world for one of such a debased profession as he. 
  It would be wise to search the forest of Toxxulia for his whereabouts.'' <br>
  <br>
  Fitorrin in Tox can be found on the Paineel side of the zone. He is immune to 
  root and snare, but only has around 2k hps and green to lvl 60. You will need 
  to hand Leiran the jaggedpine panther hide, 2 shadowjade fern leaves and 2 
  shadowjade seeds. You will receive a no drop hide in return.</font></p><p>
  <font face="Arial">Leiran tells you to go to Sol b and get blackened mithril 
  boots, no drop druid only that drops off of a kobold guardian. The kobold 
  guardian spawns in the king area, he's light blue to 60 and a shadowknight. 
  When you have the boots, combine them with the hide Lerian gave you in a large 
  sewing kit for mithril fern boots (5ac, 10hp, 10mana), this wasn't trivial at 
  165 skill in tailoring. </font></p><p><font face="Arial"><br>
  To get the polished jade plates drop off the potameid guardians. These are 
  green at 60 for the most part, immune to root, snare and slow. The plates are 
  a rare drop. Handing Cheyloh the mithril fern boots and the polished jade 
  plates gives you: <br>
  Boots of the Pine, 11ac, 2dex, 5sta, 5sv magic, druid only.</font><br> <b>
