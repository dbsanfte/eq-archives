  <b><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">You say, 'Hail, Queen 
  Velazul Di`zok' <br>
  <br>
  Queen Velazul Di`zok says 'Hail, minion! It is good to see a member of a 
  lesser race striving to improve themselves through service to the Dizok. We 
  are feeling especially generous as of late, and if you would do us <br>
  a [service], we shall reward you handsomely. ' <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'what service?' <br>
  <br>
  Queen Velazul Di`zok says 'We are not sure you are worthy, but shall assign 
  you this task in hopes you prove mighty enough to resolve it. Gather your 
  broodlings about you, and journey to Charasis. There <br>
  you shall find a Urn of spirits. We require <br>
  this, as well as [additional components]. ' <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'What additional components?' <br>
  <br>
  Queen Velazul Di`zok says 'Very well, if you feel you are up to it, lead your 
  broodlings to fallen Sebilis and return to us with a portion of undead dragon 
  sinew. Bring us the Sinew, the Urn, and your Regal Band of Bathezid as proof 
  of service, and a worthy <br>
  reward shall be yours. ' <br>
  <br>
  The Undead Dragon Sinew drops very rarely from Juggernauts and Trakanon in 
  Sebilis. <br>
  <br>
  Trakanon seems to drop the sinew about one in <br>
  three kills, occasionally dropping more than one. <br>
  <br>
  The Spirit Wracked Urn is dropped by Drusella Sathir in Charasis (3 day spawn) 
  and doesn't always have the urn. <br>
  <br>
  Hand the Undead Dragon Sinew, Urn of Spirits and Regal Band of Bathezid to the 
  Queen in Chardok. <br>
  <br>
  Queen Velazul Di`zok says 'Amazing! You have returned the trophies I asked 
  for, against impossible odds. Here is your reward, worthy minion, may it serve 
  you well. ' <br>
  <br>
  You'll receive the Ring back as well as this Cord: <br>
