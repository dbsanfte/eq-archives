    <p align="left"><font face="Arial">June 11, 2003 3:00 am <br>
    <normal>------------------------------</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>** Experience System Change - Grouping **</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>We've made some improvements to the way experience is rewarded in 
    EverQuest. These improvements are aimed at positively reinforcing the act of 
    grouping. After all, this is a Massively Multiplayer game.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>Prior to this update groups gained a 2% to 20% experience bonus for 
    having two to six members.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>As of today this bonus has increased to range from 20% to 80% for 
    having two to five members. When a group adds a sixth member, the 80% bonus 
    remains, but the experience gained is only divided by 5 before being 
    distributed. The sixth group member no longer causes the experience gain to 
    be divided by 6.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>Planes of Power zones had an increased experience award above and 
    beyond those of most other zones. Because of these new dramatic improvements 
    to group experience gains, we will be reducing the zone-specific experience 
    bonus for Planes of Power zones a bit. As long as character is grouped with 
    at least one other in these zones, they will see an improvement in 
    experience gain over the old system. The one down side to the new system is 
    that there will be a small decrease in experience for those who do not 
    group, and only for those who do so in Planes of Power zones.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>** Experience System Change - Level 60+ **</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>In addition to the above changes, we have increased the range of NPC 
    levels that give a character experience after they reach level 60. This will 
    open up many of the &quot;old world&quot; zones to players previously restricted to 
    Planes of Power zones for experience gain. The range of NPCs that will be 
    &quot;blue&quot; to a level 65 character has been increased as far as level 50, with 
    the &quot;light blue&quot; range extending to level 45. The best experience gains, 
    however, are still for fighting things around and above your level. This 
    should open up areas for high level characters in groups and solo.</normal>
    <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <normal>** Interface **</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Shared Bank Vault - We've added two shared bank slots to the 
    interface. These extra bank slots can be accessed by any character on the 
    same account and server. No-Drop and No Rent items can't be placed in these 
    bank slots, and only one of any specific Lore item can exist in the shared 
    bank at any time.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Spell Context Menus - This is a new interface menu that will make 
    memorizing spells less tedious. To access the spell menu, just right-click 
    an empty spell gem. This will open a list of spell categories. Point your 
    mouse at a category and a list of spells will be displayed. Select a spell 
    from that list to memorize it in that slot. Your character will sit down, 
    memorize the spell and stand back up.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Spell Favorites - Spell favorites are an easy way to memorize a 
    full set of eight spells without the tedious book searching. Right-clicking 
    on the spellbook icon in your spell window will open up the spell favorites 
    menu. You will be able to save your current spell lineup as a favorite, 
    delete a favorite or memorize all the spells in one of your already saved 
    spell sets. You can save as many as ten sets of spell favorites. As with the 
    new spell context menus mentioned above, this will not replace the 
    spellbook, it is meant to make memorizing large numbers of spells more 
    convenient.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Spell Descriptions - We have expanded the spell description 
    window. Along with the information that has always been available, we have 
    added an explanation about what the spell does in general that includes 
    damage and duration when appropriate. You can see these new descriptions by 
    right-clicking and holding on the spell scroll, the spell gem in your Spells 
    window, or the spell icon in your spellbook.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- New Camera - We've added a new camera mode to the game. Lovingly 
    dubbed the EQ Cam, it uses the mouse wheel to allow you to zoom away from 
    your character into a &quot;chase&quot; camera. This only works from first person mode 
    (the default view). Using the mouse wheel you can determine the distance of 
    the camera from your character, or to zoom back into first person mode. When 
    in the chase mode, mouselook turns the character and camera together and you 
    can change the pitch of the camera using the mouse.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- NPC Names - Many NPCs will be displaying additional titles to make 
    it clearer what their job is. For example, an NPC that sells tailoring 
    supplies may have the title [Tailor Supplies] under their name. This will 
    help folks find the proper merchant. It's analogous to them hanging out 
    their shingle.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Rare Character Select Crash - Using the arrow keys to try to 
    change the selected character at the character select screen when there were 
    no characters on the account was causing people to crash out of the game. 
    That's fixed now.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Guild Message of the Day - Using certain HTML codes when setting 
    up a Guild Message of the Day was causing all members of the guild to crash. 
    While this may have been amusing for pranks on your guild, we still decided 
    to fix it.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>** Spells **</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Spell level limits now enforced - Some high level spells cannot be 
    cast on characters under a certain level. In the past a caster could get 
    around this level restriction when casting a group version of a spell by 
    targeting a higher level group member, and the spell would take effect on 
    the whole group, regardless of their level. That loophole has been closed. 
    We're sorry if you have grown accustomed to the system working this way, but 
    those level restrictions are important to the integrity of lower level 
    gameplay.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Incineration and Conglaciation of Bones - Both of these spells 
    should now crit and stack (when cast by different casters).</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Divine Intervention - This spell should now be reporting the 
    amount of healing it delivers.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Healing Messages - The target of a healing spell will now get a 
    message telling them the caster's name and the amount of healing they 
    receive.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Reporting Damage Over Time - Damage over Time (DoT) done to NPCs 
    will now be reported to the caster every time it does damage. These messages 
    can be filtered in the Options window.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Boon of the Garou - The level restriction for this spell has been 
    removed. We have also fixed a bug with the spell that would prevent it from 
    being cast on target that are not on a horse if the enchanter is on 
    horseback (spell still cannot affect those on horseback).</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Wake of Karana - To improve the usefulness of this spell, we have 
    lowered the recast time from 90 seconds to 15 seconds.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Beastlord Warders - Beastlords will once again be able to summon 
    their warders in the Plane of Sky. Sorry for the delay in getting this one 
    fixed properly.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Familiars - Familiars will no longer attempt to equip items. This 
    was causing them to try to wear weapons inside their heads, which probably 
    isn't a good thing for them to do.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Spirit spell line - We have added +75 dexterity to the effects of 
    Spirit of Flame, Spirit of Rellic, and Spirit of Snow.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Spell stacking and blocking - Changed the following spell lines to 
    cause them to bounce off of each other. Each line should block everything 
    from the other line, but still be overwritten by spells of the same line.</normal>
    <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>Spiritual Strength</normal> <br>
    <normal>Spiritual Brawn</normal> <br>
    <normal>Spiritual Vigor</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>Strength of Tunare</normal> <br>
    <normal>Strength of Nature</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>Brell's Mountainous Barrier</normal> <br>
    <normal>Brell's Stalwart Shield</normal> <br>
    <normal>Brell's Steadfast Aegis</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Translocation spells - Fixed a bug with translocation spells. If a 
    second translocation spell was cast on a character before he had accepted 
    the first, both would fail.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Spell casting pets - In the past, pets were restricted to casting 
    spells of level 20 and below. We have given them access to higher level 
    spells. You may want to be careful with them until you get used to their new 
    abilities. </normal>
    <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Drunken Riders - We fixed an odd bug that allowed people who were 
    extremely drunk to cast spells without mana cost while on a horse. Yes, 
    crazy bugs like that actually happen. :)</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>** Zones **</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Droga and Nurga - The mines of Nurga have been inhabited by crafty 
    Goblins and stolid Burynai for many long years, digging and slaving away 
    under the earth. It's time to shake them up! The redesign for these zones 
    are now on the Legends server, Stormhammer. The mines of Nurga are a fun 
    zone for characters of levels about 40 to 55. The Temple of Droga 
    accommodates characters around 50th to 65th level. Both zones will have some 
    new events and quest, while retaining the distinct feel of the zones.</normal>
    <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Veksar - Since the rediscovery of the lands of Kunark, there have 
    been rumors springing from the ancient lore of the Iksar. Most of those 
    rumors remain unfounded, as gaining access to the lore of the insular Iksar 
    is no easy task. One of the most persistent legends is about a city that 
    lies buried under the Lake of Ill Omen. That city was called Veksar, and it 
    is up to you to discover the tale of its fate.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Planes of Power access - Planes of Power has provided us with 
    valuable insight into the group and guild dynamics that are involved in 
    large scale games. The way that we had expected guilds to advance through 
    the story of Planes of Power has become a problem for some guilds as some 
    members have fallen behind and found it difficult to catch up. Obviously 
    this was not our intention. We want people to play with their friends and 
    guild mates.</normal> <br>
    </font>
    <normal></normal>
    <font face="Arial"><br>
    <normal>To correct this issue, we will be allowing characters to enter the 
    following Planes of Power zones by meeting a simple level requirement:</normal>
    <br>
    </font>
    <normal></normal>
    <font face="Arial"><br>
    <normal>Level 55 and over</normal> <br>
    <normal>Plane of Storms</normal> <br>
    <normal>Plane of Torment</normal> <br>
    <normal>Plane of Valor</normal> <br>
    <normal>Crypt of Decay</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>Level 62 and over</normal> <br>
    <normal>Bastion of Thunder</normal> <br>
    <normal>Halls of Honor</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>Characters that don't meet the level requirement may still enter 
    these zones using the existing flags, and raids may still bring additional 
    unflagged or lower level characters with them. All other planes with flag or 
    story requirements for entry will still require those flags, and those flags 
    can still be obtained as they always have.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>This will make the majority of Planes of Power zones available to 
    characters over the minimum level, and will allow their guilds to travel and 
    adventure together in the planes. We understand that those that have already 
    earned the entry flags for these zones have put some effort into that 
    accomplishment. We will be giving a reward to those that have done so, in 
    the form of a nice Charm slot item and Alternate Advancement points based on 
    the number of planes you've gained access to.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>The reward for planar progression will be available this week. We 
    found an issue with part of the reward on Test server, and are in the 
    process of fixing it. This is a top priority and we plan to bring it to all 
    live servers this week.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Great Divide - The Plane of Knowledge portal in the Great Divide 
    will now be available when the Ring War is in progress.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Bastion of Thunder - We have upgraded the loot available from many 
    of the mini-bosses in the Bastion of Thunder to make the reward more inline 
    with the risk.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Sol Ro's Tower - They look like frogs, hop like frogs and now they 
    even react to spells like frogs. Flame Frogs are now flagged as animals.</normal>
    <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Rallos Zek encounter - Rallos Zek will remove anyone from the zone 
    that attacks him if they are not part of the raid that has him engaged. Even 
    in war, there are rules to be followed.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>** Items **</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Tradeskill item flag - There is a new flag on items. When viewing 
    the information about an item, if you see that it has a Tradeskill flag, it 
    is an item that can be used in a tradeskill recipe. This isn't to clearly 
    spell out every item that is used in every tradeskill recipe. The intent is 
    to assist those who are finding items that do not already have an obvious 
    use, by letting them know that the item is used in a tradeskill recipe, 
    somewhere.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- LoY &quot;Fine Steel&quot; - Many of the more commonly dropped weapons in 
    the Legacy of Ykesha zones were a bit too powerful for the ease and level 
    needed to get them. Some of the most out of line items were the Harpoon, 
    Luggald Trident, and Luggald Dagger. We've decided that it is necessary to 
    tune them down a bit.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- The Hollow Acrylia Obelisk - This is the old Acrylia key. It has 
    been changed into a charm. This charm can be used by anyone, not just those 
    that own LoY.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Bows - The Longbow of the Grimlings and the Bow of Gloaming have 
    both been given ranges. They can now be used properly.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- The Burning Flame Shield - This item had the wrong resist 
    modifiers. It now has a +30 fire resistance and a -10 cold resistance.</normal>
    <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Bazaar Search - Non-instrument items with instrument modifiers 
    will now show up in instrument type searches in the Bazaar.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Ornate Stone Medicine Totem - This item can now be equipped.</normal>
    <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Storm Reaper Thorn Machete - This newbie Halfling quest weapon is 
    now flagged as magical.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Charm of the Brotherhood - This item will now give a bonus when 
    grouped with others of either the same class or race.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Dagger of Distraction - This item can no longer be used by Monks.</normal>
    <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Edge of Eternity - Beastlords and monks can no longer use this 
    item.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Veil of Lost Hopes and Orb of Clinging Death - The casting times 
    on both of these items has been lowered.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Magi`Kot's Pants of Convergence - The effect on this item has been 
    changed to summon a Rod of Mystical Transvergance.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Cloak of the Falling Skies - The focus effect this item has 
    changed to Preservation of Solusek</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- The Wristguard of Keen Vision - This item is now useable by int. 
    casters.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- The Mask of Conceptual Energy - This item is now useable by 
    priests.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <normal>** Alternate Advancement **</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Lifeburn - This ability would cause an undue amount of aggro to be 
    generated because it would bring the caster to an extremely low number of 
    hit points, making them look like tasty targets to enemies nearby. To lessen 
    this problem, Lifeburn will no longer reduce the caster to 10 hit points, 
    but to about one fourth of the caster's hit points. This should prevent the 
    additional agro generated while retaining the risk for using the ability.</normal>
    <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Feigned Minion - The Child of Bertoxxulous pet will no longer cast 
    buff spells to break his feign when under the Feigned Minion effect.</normal>
    <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>** Quests and Tradeskills **</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Bankers - There were a few quests that required giving an item to 
    a banker. When we recently removed the ability for characters to give items 
    to bankers to help prevent mistakenly losing items, those quests became 
    unavailable. We have moved those quests to new NPCs. If you see any other 
    quests that ask you to give something to a banker, please use /bug and 
    report it to us.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Newly Stackable Items - Valor Crystals, Ceramic Linings, Holgresh 
    Fur and Casks are now stackable. Also, Valor Crystals can be sold to 
    vendors. </normal>
    <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Sewer Catfish - These unappetizing fish have begun to appear in 
    Cabilis.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Klok Foob - Will now accept a Catfish Croak Sandwich.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>** Changes for New Characters **</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Newbie Starting Locations - We've modified all locations where new 
    characters start to make them a bit more convenient for the new player. They 
    should all start very near their guild masters.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Nudging - New characters will be given a text message to encourage 
    them to hand in their newbie note to their guild master. For new players, 
    this is one of the key things to get them involved in gameplay, and one of 
    the easiest to overlook.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Guild Masters - To help guide new characters, Guild Masters now 
    take a more active role in helping out new recruits by directing them to 
    some starting points for quests.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- Quests - There are even more quests in the newbie zones, most of 
    them revolving around the pests that seem to inhabit even the grandest 
    cities.</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>** Miscellaneous **</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>- We are working on an update to the Luclin player character model 
    animations. This will not be a complete revamp of all the animations, but 
    will address some of the most common concerns. However, in the mean time you 
    may see some unusual animations, particularly when shorter PCs are running.</normal>
    <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>** UI File Changes **</normal> <br>
    <normal></normal>
    <br>
    <normal>NOTE: In order to see the new Shared Bank slots, you will need to 
    use the default bank window, or modify your custom bank window to include 
    the new slots.</normal> <br>
