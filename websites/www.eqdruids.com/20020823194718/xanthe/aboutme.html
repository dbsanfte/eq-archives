What makes her tick? How she got to be so incredibly wonderful and also attractive?<p><br> What do you mean "No"?.....<p><br> Oh well, for all those of you who want to know a little more about me, and for those of you who don't have anything better to do right now, here is a little page just about me.<br> And for those of you looking for the tailoring section, you're in the wrong place, go back to the main page....:)<p><br></i> Anyway, about me.<p><br><p><img src=xanthepic.jpg align=left width=800 height=600> This is me.<p><br><br> Wanderer of out blessed mother Tunare, I am currently of the 52nd Awakening. I spend my time on Bertoxxulous server and am currently a member of the most excellent guild Healers of Norrath.<p><br> As far as i can recall, my earliest interest in trade skills was as my ranger, Treye, who was my very first character on my fiance's account. Treye, like a lot of rangers, liked the idea of fletching although that didnt go too well for him, but since that fateful day I have been hooked. Since then I have mastered every trade skill, purely for the love of it, but more than anything else I like to consider myself a Tailor, as it is the one that I love the best (and also hate, as many other tailors may tell you:)<p><br> My (more than) two (now) crowning glories to date have been a Shaped Compound Darkwood Bow with a Silken String, a Cobalt Drake Hide Belt, which was a complete fluke and now takes pride of place around my waist. Nearly had a heart attack when that combined hehe:) Black Panther legs and boots, a lovely Acrylia Studded Cloak for myself and a couple of pther pieces.<p><br> I would like to take the opportunity here to thank my 2 (3) very good friends, Dergoth/ Dumnos and Lander, who is my lucky elf, for just being there whenever I am about, and for being generally wonderful guys all round:) And also my other very good friends whom I have met since I last updated, Colins, Llaenua, Sali and Borsan. I would also like to thank my RL fiance Rainaer (60th Sorcerer , erm, sp?), for putting up with me spending all evening trolling through vendors and randomly shrieking "Ooh I need that for Tailoring!" while he is hunting stuff, and giving him a heart attack. I also want to thank him for making me the happiest woman alive, and to tell him that I love him more than anything in the world, even EverQuest.<p>And if you want to be sick, there is a bin in that corner you can use....<p><br> For those of you who really want to know, and also so I can keep track of them, my skills are:<p><br> Baking 191<br> Brewing 200<br> Fletching 200<br> Jewellery 200<br> Pottery 200<br> Smithing 185<br> Tailoring 225<br><br> On Bertoxx I also have several alts who I occasionally play, including a Necro, Warrior, Monk, Enchanter, Ranger and Rogue.<p><br> And for those of you who want to know who I <i>really</i> am....<p><br><p><img src=xantheme.jpg align=left width=339 height=416> This is me posing.<p><br> I am currently 21 years old, a student taking Biology at Sussex University, and living in England. I enjoy roleplaying, wargaming and EverQuest, and also staying in bed until unreasonable hours whenever the opportunity presents itself.<p><br> If you have found this site useful, or possibly even entertaining (even if it was only to laugh at my picture), please take a moment to sign the Guestbook and tell me about it, it's the feedback that really does make it all worth the while:) Happy Trade Skills!</font><p><br><br><br><br><br> <br><hr><br><center><a href=index.htm>Back to Main Page</a></center><br><br> <IMG SRC=http://visit.geocities.com/counter.gif ALT=Counter width=100 height=30> <br><br><hr><br><center><p></p>
