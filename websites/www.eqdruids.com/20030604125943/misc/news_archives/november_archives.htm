          <p class="MsoNormal">This is why we are going to have to probably shut 
          off advertising sponsored boards. <br>
          <br>
          Each page view is paid for by us. It costs us real money to host these 
          sites. If you think $3600.00 a year is a lot to host this community, I 
          *BEG* you to go try and do it yourself. Your time and money 
          committment will be far greater than the $300 per month we're 
          charging.<br>
          <br>
          ezboard is probably going to move to GOLD only and ezSupporter only 
          boards... it is the only way we can survive and prosper. There is a 
          viscious cycle happening right now.. people use pop up stoppers which 
          leads to us putting more pop up ads, which leads to more people using 
          pop up stoppers.. <br>
          <br>
          We are at the point where we feel if a person isn't willing to support 
          their community at $1 per month, then that community needs to exist 
          elsewhere b/c frankly, we can't continue to provide service under 
          those conditions.<br>
          <br>
          I applaud Zadkiel for being smart and making a business arrangement to 
          keep this board gold. It is so easy for people to criticize when they 
          know nothing about the time committment and effort it takes to run a 
          community like this.<br>
          <br>
          Stop the hate and support each other - it makes life so much more fun 
          if you focus on the positive rather than the negative.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It all has to be paid somehow.&nbsp; Keep that in mind.</p>

        <p>We came up with a few tips and comments about using the Music Player. 
        Here are some hints that may help: <br>
        <br>
        - You can use wildcards when specifying files to load. For example, if 
        you click &quot;Add&quot;, browse down to C:\MyMusic, then type &quot;*.mp3&quot; in the 
        edit window portion of the File Selection Window, then click &quot;Ok&quot;, the 
        Music Player Window will attempt to add all files in the C:\MyMusic 
        directory that end in mp3. <br>
        <br>
        - When saving playlists, be sure to put the .M3U extension on the 
        filename or you won't be able to load it again. When loading files, the 
        Music Player looks at the extension to determine what kind of file it 
        is, and won't load files of types it doesn't recognize. <br>
        <br>
        - When first opening the File Selection Window, you may notice a delay 
        while the code determines which drives on your system are valid. <br>
        <br>
        - While songs continue to play during zoning, no song can begin during 
        zoning. The Music Player will continue with the next song when you zone 
        in. <br>
        <br>
        - When the Random button is depressed, the playlist is scrambled. 
        Un-pressing the Random button will revert the list back to its original 
        order for ease in finding certain listings. Pressing Random again will 
        re-scramble the list in a new &quot;random&quot; order.</td>

        ------------------------------ <br>
        <br>
        ** Spells ** <br>
        <br>
        - Affliction Efficiency should now work on Damage over Time spells of 
        level 61 and greater. <br>
        - Imbue Disease should be scribeable by Shaman at level 63. <br>
        - Corrected the range on some Planes of Power group spells so they will 
        affect the group, not just the caster. <br>
        - Corrected the animation for Katta's Song of Sword Dancing. <br>
        - Corrected the animation for Spirit of Eagle. <br>
        - Increased the affect radius of Radiant Cure so that it will affect 
        group members. <br>
        - Changed the method of obtaining the Planes of Power 'imbue' spells. 
        Speak with the fellow that gave them to you before for more information.
        <br>
        - Fixed a bug where casting Levant while on a horse could cause crashes.
        <br>
        - Fixed a problem that was preventing pet owners from controlling their 
        regular pets if they had a Wake the Dead pet in use. <br>
        - Fixed a bug that caused characters to summon corpses with similar 
        names rather than the intended corpse. <br>
        - Fixed a bug with Unswerving Hammer of Faith and Flaming Sword of Xuzl 
        that prevented them from disappearing when they should. <br>

        be reinstated in the near future. <br>
        - Fixed the spell gem colors for some Area of Effect spells. <br>
        - Corrected more issues with spell turn-ins. You should no longer get

        appropriate level. <br>

        <br>

        <br>
        ** Alternate Advancement ** <br>

        <br>
        - Fixed the invisible forge in Felwithe. <br>
        - Added Collapsing Fletching, and Collapsing Mortar and Pestle. Added

        information. <br>
        - Added a few forges to Crystal Caverns in Frostone. <br>

        separated. <br>

        ** User Interface ** <br>

        - Made it so it is much easier to trade items to a player on a horse.
        <br>
        - Added new column to Bazaar Search Window that will display stat 
        numbers if you choose to sort by a stat. <br>
        - /doability 1 should work again. <br>
        - Increased the size of raids to 72 members. <br>

        <br>
        - The Music Player is now available on the Live servers. Alt-K opens the 
        player. Using it should be relatively self-explanatory. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** Miscellaneous ** <br>
        <br>
        - Fixed a couple of broken teleporters in Paineel. <br>
        - The Missionaries should be back on Sullon Zek. <br>
        - Fixed a bug with NPCs' ability to mitigate slow. <br>
        - Fixed an odd bug with enraging NPCs that could cause zones to crash.
        <br>
        - Characters no longer consume food or get the food and drink messages 
        when in trader mode. <br>
        - Small races should now be able to get out of the pool in Shadowhaven.
        <br>
        - Your box of Souls should now be returned to you when you are 
        collecting souls. For those of you whose Box of Souls ended up stick in 
        a Soul Orb, combining your Orb inside a Collector's Box from Curator 
        Merri should yield your Box of Souls as well as your Soul Orb. <br>

        ** By Winged Messenger ** <br>
        <br>
        A lone messenger streaks across the rocky roads of the mighty Wakening 
        Lands, an urgent message kept safely within his talons. Dire news he 
        brings to his master, the Lord Yelinak; there is much turmoil in wake of 
        the prismatic's release, and he must inform the ancient dragon of the 
        weary times to come. As he rushes past the lumbering trees on all sides 
        of him, he harks back to a more peaceful time. Certainly the brow of his 
        mighty Lord showed less strain, less agitation, though not much. He had 
        always thought that the prismatic's release would surely be more 
        problematic than anything else he could imagine. He now knew that there 
        was much more at stake than ever before, and that the Shrine would need 
        to be on its guard. <br>
        <br>
        As he came to the entrance of the Shrine, he tensed for a moment, hoping 
        that this dire news wouldn't end the life that he and his kin had known 
        for so long. Yet he feared that nothing could stop that change, for the 
        might of the Kin would be tested in the coming times, and there would 
        surely be dangers he had yet to see. He made his way through the 
        corridors up to his master's chambers. As he came closer, he noticed new 
        members of the Kin he had never before seen. As large as his Lord, they 
        spoke quietly amongst themselves and with Yelinak himself. He was 
        unnerved by this startling addition to the Shrine, but felt that it was 
        likely necessary. Perhaps his Lord had already heard the news and had 
        already begun making plans. Either way, it was his duty to inform 
        Yelinak of the recent events; the Giants would know no struggle like 
        that which the Shrine would give them. <br>
        <br>
        He walked towards Lord Yelinak, majestic in his appearance yet with a 
        certain calming aura about him. He cleared his throat and began, &quot;M'lord 
        Yelinak, I bring news from the East...&quot;</font></td>

    <td height=18>From EQLive:<p>Generally speaking we don't announce new 
        NPC functionality, tricks, spell effects or other things that we think 
        are part of the discovery of a new expansion or zone. However, this 
        functionality isn't working properly right now and in doing so it is 
        causing a bit of confusion. <br>
        <br>
        With Planes of Power we gave NPCs the ability to mitigate the effect of 
        slow-type spells. This means that some NPCs have the ability to cause 
        slows to be less than 100% effective. This is not a &quot;slow cap&quot;, when it 
        is working properly. The best slow will have the best effect. <br>
        <br>
        This allows our designers much more freedom to balance encounters when 
        considering the use of slow spells. For Planes of Power they did not 
        have to decide solely between the two extremes of slow taking full 
        effect or just turning it off. The relative power of each slow spell is 
        unchanged, and making NPCs immune to slow spells is not the only option 
        when tuning an encounter. There are some encounters where we would like 
        to see slowing considered a good thing for a group to have, but not to 
        the point where the NPC becomes a wimp after he's slowed. <br>
        <br>
        In theory this is a great thing. <br>
        <br>
        However, some time between beta and the release of Planes of Power this 
        new feature stopped working properly. Thanks to everyone that sent in 
        emails and /bug reports for helping us narrow down the problem. <br>
        <br>
        We are aware of the problem and we're working on getting it fixed. <br>

        <br>
        There is a rare problem that can cause people to not be credited with 
        all of the expansions that they own. This may cause you to be unable to 
        access a character in an expansion zone. If it believes you are missing 
        Planes of Power you will not be able to gain experience past level 60, 
        or past level 50 if you are missing all expansions. This may cause a 
        loss of experience for some characters in rare instances. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Please double check to make sure that you have the correct expansions 
        listed when you log in.</b> <br>
        <br>
        If you do not, return to the login screen and try logging in again (and 
        again check to make sure you have all appropriate expansions listed). 
        Logging back into the server should restore your access to the 
        expansions, but make certain to check. <br>
