<p>Elphubba on Veeshan submitted this tactic to eqdruids.com on the new
root/snare changes.&nbsp; Please substitute the highest level spell series you
can cast instead of the ones specifically mentioned...heh don't cast barbshield
if you are level 60 =)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the change to root spells, Druids now have a superb tactic for soloing
high blues to even high yellow cons. The only worry for yellow or red con mobs
is the rate of resists. This won't work if the spells won't stick! If the mob
has a relatively low magic resistance, this will work well. Root now does NOT
remove any speed adjusting spells, such as SoW or Snare. Therefore, the best way
to &quot;kite&quot; mobs is to start with snare(ensnare is better if you have it
at 29+), then pull the mob to a decent area away from possible adds. On the way,
cast swarm series and flame lick series DoTs if time permits( and others if 50+).
Once the mob is where you want them, cast&nbsp; root series (usually your
highest one is best). Do NOT so this with the low level root spell. That spell
is junk. You will have to wait until 24 or later to use this. If you are 14-23,
just snare and kite normally. Once the mob is rooted, cast DoTs if not already
up. Back away to the edge of casting range and meditate. If you can hide like my
halfling, do so while medding. Check if hide worked by /conning the target.
Whenever a DoT, snare or root breaks, recast, reposition, and med. I prefer
casting snare before root if they both break at the same time. I never cast DD
spells unless I am dealing with a caster, or if I pick up and add and want to
finish the first one off quickly. Because casters can kill you while rooted, I
nuke them to death. However, you can run outside their range while they are
rooted and DoTted. A variation to this tactic is to DoT down to less than 50% of
the target's health, then shield of (barbs/spikes/etc) and go
&quot;porcupine&quot; the rest of the way. I re-cast only flame lick series DoT
and snare once porcupining. This is because of the AC debuff feature of flame
lick, and snare is always good. :-) I wait until root breaks to begin this, so
the mob will try to run instead of fighting back. This helps save mana and
trades some health. If you're 100% health and 0% mana, you still have to sit on
your butt. This way, you can heal and meditate at the same time between fights.
Pre-fight buffs are (minimum): SoW/wolf form (DUH keep SoW up always!)
Barbshield (never let it down, either) Skin like... (in case of resists, and for
&quot;porcupine&quot; variation) Others optional. I add endure/resists if
fighting casters. Also I use Strength, and sometimes Firefist. Pick up clarity
and you will be fighting almost non-stop!<!--mstheme--></font><!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table><!--msnavigation--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td><!--mstheme--><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">
