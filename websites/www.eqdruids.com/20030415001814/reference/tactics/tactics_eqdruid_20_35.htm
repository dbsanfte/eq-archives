Our soloing ability increases as we advance in levels. Our grouping ability also increases, and because we can heal just as efficiently as a cleric during this period, druids are welcome in almost any group.</p><p>One of the goals of this guide will be to instruct a mid-level druid in some the many strategies available to the class during this time.</p><p>Another goal will be to provide information concerning hunting grounds and general tips to help reduce the time required to obtain level 35.</p><p><a name=20-23><font face=Arial size=3 color=008000><b>Levels 20 - 23</b></font></a><p>By now, you should have purchased all of your spells up to level 19. Your self-teleportation spells will be one of your greatest assets, as it will allow you to travel to another zone should the one you are currently in is too crowded.</p><p>One of the most useful tools a druid receives during these levels is <b>Tracking</b>. This skill allows a druid to locate targets within a zone quickly and more efficiently than before. It is also a useful method of locating rare spawns within a zone.</p><p>Tracking begins at level 20 for all druids, and with regular use, advances quickly until it caps at skill level of 125.</p><p><b>Note:</b> You will want to train with a druid trainer when you achieve level 20 (make sure to put one of your training points into Tracking).</p><p><b>Note:</b> The spell <b>Lesser Succor</b> is available at level 18. This spell is considered an emergency spell, and will transport you and your party to a <a href=../spell_related/spells_egress.htm>safe spot</a> within the zone. The advantage this spell has over the evacuation spells is that it does not remove your party from the zone, thus reducing downtime caused by travel. We recommend that you purchase it now but hold off on using it until later, unless you frequent dungeons often, or you have a large mana pool.</p><center><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td><font face=Arial size=2><u><b><a href=http://www.eqdruids.com/spells/level_18_spells.htm>Recommended Level 18 Spells</a>:</b></u><ul> <li>Lesser Succor</ul></td></tr><tr><td><font face=Arial size=2><b><u>Recommended Zones:</u></b><ul> <li>South Karana <li>East Karana <li>Lake Rathe <li>Solusek's Eye (Sol A) <li>Lake of Ill Omen <li>West Karana</ul></td></tr><tr><td><font face=Arial size=2><p align=left><u><b>South Karana:</b></u></p><p>Hermit and lower-level aviaks.

Not only do additional self-teleport spells become available, but the illusion spell <b>Wolf Form</b> is now at your command.</p><p>Wolf Form is generally a superior upgrade to Spirit of Wolf. It gives you a larger increase in movement speed than SoW. It also increases your attack rating, has a longer duration, provides Infravision, and changes your form to that of a wolf. It will also adjust your faction level with many NPCs and mobs.</p><p><b>Note</b>: Wolf Form simply lowers some factions and raises others, so if you original faction standing is not very high, it will drop you to KOS, but if you are their ally in regular form, then you should probably be fine as a wolf.</p><p>For a list of areas where being in wolf form makes you KOS (Killed On Sight), click <a href=http://pub50.ezboard.com/feqdruids24038frm12.showMessage?topicID=33.topic>here</a>.</p><p>At level 24, druids also receive an upgrade to their root spell in <b>Ensnaring Roots</b>, and an upgrade to the Swarm line of spells in <b>Creeping Crud</b>. These two spells allow you to rot difficult targets more easily than you could previously.</p><p>Druids also receive an upgrade to their charm spell in <b>Charm Animals</b>, which will allow you to charm higher-level animals.

Largely due to your new ability to teleport groups, or <b>Group Gate (GG)</b>. This ability is highly sought after by players without the ability to teleport themselves, making it an effective source of income.</p><p>Druids receive several upgrades to their spells at this level.

At these levels, both spells will normally use less than 20% of your mana pool, or approximately one bubble of mana.</p><p>The spell <b>Ring of Misty</b> will make selling and banking <b>much</b> easier.
