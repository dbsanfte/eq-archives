  <font face="Arial">Giwin Mirakon tells you, 'How did you get in here? Hrmm no 
  matter, you will be helping me now for i am a [great warrior] of Rallos Zek 
  and i know you wish not to provoke my fury!'<br>
  <br>
  You says, 'What great warrior' <br>
  <br>
  Giwin Mirakon is located in the first room at the entrance of the Factory in 
  Plane of Innovation. <br>
  <br>
  Giwin Mirakon tells you, 'Yeah, you heard me! You know that I must be 
  important if Rallos himself has plucked me from battlefield to complete this 
  [task]. Even though i serve my lord, I am desperate to return to my place on 
  the eternal battlefield.'<br>
  <br>
  You say, 'What task?' <br>
  <br>
  Giwin Mirakon tells you, 'Ya, you see Rallos sent me here to contract the 
  machines to work on a mana powered piece of machinery that could test all on 
  the eternal battlefield. This weapon of ultimate destruction is taking quite a 
  long time to be completed. You know.. If you were to go [test the machine] and 
  it were to fail against you I could be on my way back to tell Rallos that it 
  was defeated by mere mortals. Help me to get back to the battlefield and out 
  of this rusted out junk heap.'<br>
  <br>
  You say, 'I will test the machine' <br>
  <br>
  Giwin Mirakon tells you, 'Haha! I knew i sensed the warring spirit within you. 
  Go through over there. Ignore those steam powered soldiers and their talk of 
  perimeters. Go into the main construction area, you will know you are there 
  when you see power carriers taking energy to power up the machine. If you can 
  stop the energy carriers from releasing their energy the machine will activate 
  to see what has happened. I shall come to check on you and take a full report 
  when you have destroyed it it. Long live Rallos!'<br>
  <br>
  You have received a character flag! <br>
  <br>
  Kill the Mechanical Behemoth and you will be able to get flagged to enter 
  Drunder, Fortress of Zek.</font></b></p>
