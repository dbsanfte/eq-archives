        <normal>- Further optimizations to reduce bandwidth and 'lag'. It is 
        difficult to describe the value of this change, but it should show a 
        noticeable improvement for many. We've also resolved many of the hit 
        point update and movement issues that occurred recently.</normal> <br>

        had to say:</font><hr>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Arial">Hi, <br>
          <br>
          We wanted to give you an update on some of the things we've been 
          working on lately. We've been following the various class and server 
          boards, and looking for pressing issues. While this isn't the complete 
          list, here are some of the topics currently being reviewed - <br>
          <br>
          - PoP planar flags and how they are acquired. We're experimenting with 
          some ideas that let people accompany their raids to the deeper planes 
          without having all previous flags. Our goal is to allow a player to 
          participate in raids and guild events, even if the player wasn't able 
          to acquire a previous flag. This would not grant them a flag for that 
          zone, but would give them access to it while on the raid. We're 
          looking at several options, but our current version in testing allows 
          a raid to bring along a small group of people without the necessary 
          flags, if the raid has most of it's members flagged for an event or 
          plane. <br>
          <br>
          - PoP zone access quests. We're looking at the difficulty of the 
          quests for individual access to the various planes. Our goal is to 
          make it reasonable to gain access to later planes by doing the quests, 
          without making it trivial or unbalancing when compared to the 
          raid-gained planar access methods. <br>
          <br>
          - We're looking at the state of Charm spells, and may make adjustments 
          so that the cost and risk associated with charming high-level pets is 
          balanced with the power of the spell. <br>
          <br>
          - We're continuing to evaluate the drop rates of PoP spell parchments 
          to see if any further adjustments are needed. <br>
          <br>
          - We're reviewing the tanking ability of the various melee and hybrid 
          classes to be sure each class is competitively balanced with the 
          others. The main factors we're considering are the ability to take 
          damage, deal damage, and the additional abilities of each class. The 
          goal with this review is to find any issues where melee classes are 
          not &quot;bringing enough to the party&quot; when comparing their package of 
          abilities. We're paying particular attention to the avoidance-focused 
          classes such as the monk, to be sure things end up where they should.
          <br>
          <br>
          - We're going back through priest classes to find any major balance 
          issues. Currently we're focusing on healing, secondary abilities, and 
          the value of each class in different situations. <br>
          <br>
          - Shields and blocking. We're reviewing the impact of giving an innate 
          chance to block when using a shield. We'd like increase the value of 
          shields, and make it a worthwhile choice for players who might 
          normally dual-wield weapons or use a two-handed weapon. We're working 
          on balancing this against classes which use shields by default, and 
          therefore wouldn't be making any trade-offs to equip a shield. <br>
          <br>
          - Lull spells. We're watching the impact of recent changes to be sure 
          these spells remain useful, but are not over-powered. <br>
          <br>
          - Riposte and Enrage on planar mobs. We're looking at alternatives to 
          make these abilities less punishing on common planar monsters. <br>
          <br>
          - Tradeskills. We're reviewing the current recipe line-up for any gaps 
          in skill progression, and items that aren't appropriately rewarding 
          for their difficulty. <br>
          <br>

        Mithaniel Marr, the god of Valor. Frogloks can be a variety of classes 
        and are the first race with both Shaman and Cleric class options open to 
        them. Frogloks may also take the paths of Warrior, Paladin and Wizard.</p>
        <p>Frogloks are a race of strong swimmers and are able to hold their 
        breath for long periods of time. In addition, Frogloks have excellent 
        night vision through the benefit of the Ultravision ability. Frogloks 
        are able to wear both small and medium sized armor. Frogloks are viewed 
        as an odd race, but are tolerated in all but the evil cities of Norrath. 
        Followers of Innoruuk, Cazic-Thule and Bertoxxulous have no love for the 
        Frogloks and will often attack them on sight.</p>

        *** Patch Information ***<br>
        <br>
        ** Gameplay/Features **<br>
        <br>
        - With our last patch and the patch today, we've significantly reduced 
        the amount of bandwidth that EverQuest needs to use, even in large raid 
        or extremely-crowded-zone situations.<br>
        - Fixed a problem with tints not properly updating when armor is 
        removed.<br>
        - Fixed a bug with character faces displaying incorrectly to other 
        players when you zone in after them.<br>
        - Fixed resurrection timer that was counting down against the 3 hour 
        limit when player was not logged in. <br>
        - Corrected a problem with health and movement updates being delayed.<br>
        <br>
        ** Spells **<br>
        <br>
        - NPCs will now notice Druid and Shaman Percentage Heal spells in a 
        manner similar to traditional healing spells.<br>
        - Removed the chance for slow spells to be reversed from the 17 NPCs 
        that had this ability.<br>
        - Fixed a bug that was preventing Curses, Diseases, and Poisons from 
        being removed.<br>
        - Raised all recast times below 2.25 seconds up to 2.25 seconds. This is 
        a change in the spell data as the first part of a two-part change needed 
        to correct the &quot;Recast time not met&quot; problem. More information is 
        available at the Developer's Corner at www.everquest.com.<br>
        <br>
        ** Alternate Advancement/Special Abilities **<br>
        <br>
        - The range on the Bard Ability &quot;Boastful Bellow&quot; has been increased 
        slightly.<br>
        - Fixed a bug with Harm Touch that was not allowing it to increase the 
        standard amount per level over level 60.<br>
        <br>
        ** User Interface **<br>
        <br>
        - Fixed a bug with effects in the Songs window. They were not getting 
        removed on the client when the bard was dispelled.<br>
        - Introduced new Story window. The purpose of this window is to provide 
        story updates in a readily available location. ALT-N toggles the window. 
        You can select to have the window pop up when new story elements are 
        added if you wish.<br>
        - Item Links are once again creatable from Items and from other Item 
        Links. Please do not attempt to &quot;mine&quot; the servers for undiscovered 
        items. Links now have a built-in mechanism to prevent those who would go 
        on fishing expeditions by sending up many bad links in an attempt to 
        discover new items. These invalid links are logged, as are the accounts 
        of those who create them.<br>
        - Added an optional confirmation box before spending AA points. To turn 
        on this confirmation box, please check the Options window.<br>
        <br>
        ** Miscellaneous **<br>
        <br>
        - Sage Quests in Plane of Knowledge have been fixed.<br>
        - The event to fight Bertoxxulous in the Crypt of Decay will reset 4 to 
        6 hours after the event is failed. It will respawn normally if the event 
        is won.<br>
        <br>
        ** New/Changed Interface Files **<br>
        <br>
        - EQUI_StoryWnd.xml (actually added with the Jan. 9th patch)<br>

        recast times.</font></span></h1>
        <p><font face="Arial">Hi everyone, <br>
        <br>
        We've made some changes to spell recasting delay with the patch on 
        January 15th. This change may seem worse than it actually is, so we 
        wanted to be sure it's well explained to avoid unnecessary concern. <br>
        <br>
        When a player casts a spell in EverQuest, their spell gems grey out and 
        become unusable for a period of just over two seconds. After these two 
        seconds have passed, the spell gems ungrey and can be used again. Some 
        specific spells have longer than the minimum 2.25 seconds recasting 
        delay, and they take longer before they are ready to be cast again. 
        However, no spell was legitimately recastable in less than 2.25 seconds.
        <br>
        <br>
        With the old EverQuest interface, the minimum recast delay was enforced 
        on the game client and it worked well. With the introduction of the new 
        interface though, we've run into issues where your spell gems would 
        ungrey and appear ready sooner than the minimum recast delay. When this 
        happened, players would sometimes get the message &quot;Recast time not met&quot; 
        when they tried to cast a spell, and the spell would fail. This is very 
        annoying for players, and can certainly be dangerous in many situations.
        <br>
        <br>
        We've applied that 2.25 minimum recast delay directly to the spell data. 
        Most spells already had more than the minimum recast delay, but those 
        that did not have now been changed. In many cases, this makes it appear 
        that a spell that used to have no recast delay now has 2.25 seconds 
        recast delay. In actual use though, nothing has actually changed - in 
        the past, casters always had to wait 2.25 seconds for the spell gems to 
        become ready, and the wait will be the same now, it just appears 
        differently in the spell data. <br>
        <br>
        This change isn't intended to make spell casting slower or more 
        difficult. Now that we've fully transitioned to the new interface it's 
        simply the best way to continue enforcing the same delay that's always 
        been there. <br>
        <br>
        This is the first part of a two-part change that we're making to correct 
        the &quot;Recast time not met&quot; issue. The next step needs to be made in code 
        and should appear on the Test server soon. </font></td>

        <p><b>Slow Mitigation</b> <br>
        <br>
        As many know, with the release of Planes of Power, some NPCs were given 
        the ability to &quot;mitigate&quot; the effect of attack speed altering spells, 
        such that Slows would not be quite as effective against them, but would 
        still be useful and desirable. <br>
        <br>
        As part of that same change, others gained the potential to be &quot;sped up&quot; 
        by slow spells. After re-evaluating this mechanic over the past weeks, 
        where a slow spell actually makes the target attack faster, we've 
        decided to pull it entirely. <br>
        <br>
        We're doing this for a few reasons, many of which have also been pointed 
        out by members of the classes for whom slowing is a primary role: <br>
        <br>
        * It was kind of an interesting idea at the time, but unless we decide 
        to add other &quot;I press this button, and bad things happen, instead&quot; types 
        of effects to everyone's core abilities, it really does unfairly single 
        out slowers. Suffice it to say, this isn't a road we plan on going down 
        any time soon. <br>
        <br>
        * It's only used in a total of seventeen NPCs in the entire game. 
        Removing this behavior won't have any impact on tuning in the encounters 
        where it exists. Those NPCs will be either set to slow-immune or will 
        allow slows to have a slight impact on them, depending on the encounter.
        <br>
        <br>
        * It puts slowers in the unique position of feeling like they could 
        cause a full wipeout every time a new encounter is tried, simply by 
        doing their job. If an encounter is set to penalize slowers in this way, 
        it essentially guarantees at least one failure in a particularly 
        frustrating fashion, since slows can't be removed from hostile targets.
        <br>
        <br>
        It's entirely different when a failure occurs because someone makes a 
        critical mistake. That's absolutely part of learning and playing any 
        game. However, a failure occurring because someone does what has always 
        been their job; not very compelling. <br>
        <br>
        Just to clarify: Slow mitigations and immunities will be staying in. 
        Slows having the potential to have the reverse effect is Right Out. (Or 
        will be in the next patch.) <br>
        <br>
        <b>Bandwidth Usage and /Serverfilter</b> <br>
        <br>
        This is one of those that we've been meaning to talk about for a while 
        now, but it always seemed to be pushed back by other, more pressing 
        matters. <br>
        <br>
        For the past months, /Serverfilter hasn't had any practical use. It 
        simply sends a message off to the server that the server no longer does 
        anything with, which is why some folks with overly-restrictive network 
        equipment are still able to use it as a means to &quot;jump start&quot; what 
        appears to be a dying connection. <br>
        <br>
        The server-side filters are now controlled by the individual items that 
        live in the Options window, on the Filters page. <br>
        <br>
        Also in a recent patch, we've significantly reduced the amount of 
        bandwidth that EverQuest needs to use, even in large raid or 
        extremely-crowded-zone situations. Unfortunately, one side effect of 
        these changes is a problem that didn't show up in the small test server 
        community, and is only highly prevalent on the live servers; Periodic 
        movement and health updates are nowhere near as reliable as they should 
        be. <br>
        <br>
        Fortunately, this issue will be fixed in the patch that is scheduled for 
        Wednesday, Jan 15 at 3am. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Curses, Poisons, and Diseases </b><br>
        <br>
        The troubles with these types of detrimental spells not being curable 
        will also be fixed in the same patch. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Faces</b> <br>
        <br>
        With any luck, a fix for the interesting new issues with faces will also 
        make it into this patch as well.</td>

        unlock your mouse. To do so, use the SHIFT + ALT + R key combination.
        <br>
        <br>
        You can change that key combination under Options - Keyboard. <br>
        <br>
        I also wanted to remind you that ALT + ENTER and ALT + SHIFT + R do not 
        work until you get into the game - character select currently ignores 
        them. <br>
        <br>
        We are also aware of an issue that has occurred when trying to use ALT + 
        TAB with EQ in a window with Windows XP. Essentially, Windows XP keeps a 
        list of program compatibility information. Unfortunately, for EverQuest 
        it specifically disables ALT + TAB. We're working on a solution to this 
        issue. <br>

        <normal /><br>
        <normal>Over the last six months we have been keeping the Classic 
    EverQuest interface as well as the Velious interface working through all of 
    the features that we have added (built-in MP3 player, item links, compass, 
    enhanced /bug reporting tool, and others). However, with the release of some 
    of the new features in this patch, such as running EQ in a window, we must 
    now say goodbye to the older interfaces. They have been disabled as of 
    today.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>They served us well.</normal> <br>
        <normal />
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>** EQ in a Window **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>EverQuest can now be run in a window. To place EverQuest in a 
    window, simply press Alt-Enter. You can also switch out of EverQuest to 
    another program by using the familiar Alt-Tab. It is important that you do 
    not do this until you are in-game, do not do this during the login process.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>It is important to note a few things. Running the game in a 
    window may reduce game performance a bit. And, as always, the more programs 
    you have running at the same time the more resources they use.</normal>
        <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>At this time, due to some changes that need to be made on the 
    front end, it is not possible to run two instances of EverQuest. We will be 
    working to make the necessary changes over the next few weeks.</normal>
        <br>
        <normal />
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>** Songs Window **</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>We have added a new window to the interface along with new game 
    functionality. The Songs window is a new buff window that holds up to 6 bard 
    song buffs. This increases the potential maximum effects that a character 
    can have to 21 (15 standard and the 6 new ones). The new window only holds 
    certain bard songs (generally the 3-tick songs). Only beneficial songs will 
    qualify for the new buff box, and not all of those. Any buff in the new 
    Songs window is considered temporary and will not be saved when you zone.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>Songs that qualify to go into the new window will go into that 
    window first. Any qualifying songs over six will be rerouted to the main 
    Effects window. Cancel Magic effects will see these new buff slots as buff 
    slots #16-21.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal>Note for User Interface skin creators: The Label EQTypes 80-85 
    are the Songs window song names.</normal> <br>
        <normal /><br>
        <normal />
        <normal>- Some magical effects on Planar class armor have been altered. 
    In most cases the effects were upgraded, but a few items were given weaker 
    effects that were more in line with the difficulty of obtaining them. </normal>
        <br>
        <normal>- Fixed a bug that was causing a few Planes of Power NPCs to 
    take too long to respawn.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Wu's Attack should now work correctly.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Incoming damage now interacts with Wrath of the Wild and other 
    rune-type spells in their proper order.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Pact of Shadow and Shadow Compact will once again heal player 
    characters.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Charmed Pets will no longer remain charmed after the owner 
    dies.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Sending special characters (such as &lt; and &quot;) via EQIM will no 
    longer freeze the game.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Hitting Autoattack when in explore mode at Character Select 
    will no longer cause the game to crash.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- The Loadskin window will now load skins other than the default 
    properly.</normal> <br>
        <normal>- Fixed and issue that caused some NPC's text to be cut short.</normal>
        <br>
        <normal>- Fixed (but did not rename) the Broken Golem. He should no 
    longer be hated in Fear, just feared...</normal> <br>
        <normal>-Lowered the duration of calm-type spells that effect creatures 
    level 50 and over.</normal> <br>

        <p>Our Testing Department began running a full compatibility run on 
        EverQuest with DirectX 9 before the holidays and recently finished the 
        first pass. <br>
        <br>
        There really isn't any compelling reason to upgrade to it right now, 
        since neither EQ nor many video drivers makes use of any DirectX 9 
        specific features. <br>
        <br>
        The following is a list of the processors and video cards that our 
        Compatibility Lab uses in their test matrix: <br>
        <br>
        AMD K6 3 500/566 <br>
        AMD 2100XP <br>

        <br>
        Ryan from the Lab would like to add the following: <br>
        <br>
        &quot;All latest available drivers were used for each test, and based on what 
        we saw, across each operating system (all 4 were tested, where 
        applicable) [sh: 98, ME, XP, 2k], and we saw no visible issues. We did 
        not experience random crashes, and visually did not see any anomalies. 
        The only thing that we've seen is that there may be a limited amount of 
        frame rate loss in some configurations.&quot; <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        While we'll also be giving abandoned cards such as the Voodoo line a 
        once-over, please note that we are still unable to provide official 
        support for them. <br>
        <br>
        If people have an orphaned card like a Voodoo, then upgrade to DirectX 
        9, and EverQuest breaks, there's unfortunately not a thing that anyone 
        will be able to do about it, as there aren't even official drivers for 
        it anymore. <br>
        <br>
        Best,<br>
