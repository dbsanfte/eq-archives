    <p class=MsoNormal><font face=Verdana>Lets go over the different problem factions in the quest and their fixes or work around.</font></p><p class=MsoNormal>
  <font face="Verdana">First there is a new quest that solves many of the faction 
  issues in the Druid epic quest.</font></p><p class=MsoNormal>
  <font face="Verdana">Jeremy Leafrunner by the camp fire will eventually ask you 
  to deliver a letter to his grandmother if you follow his dialogue options. He 
  gives you a letter to take to Elishia Leafrunner in Felwithe. She can be found 
  in the second Felwithe zone, in the part with the caster guilds. Delivering 
  the message gets the following faction adjustments. <br>
  <br>
  +Keepers of the Art <br>
  +King Tearis Thex <br>
  +Faydarks Champions <br>
  -The Dead <br>
  <br>
  Continuing to talk to Elishia gets you another letter to take back to Jeremy. 
  Delivering this letter gets you more faction. <br>
  <br>
  +Residents of Jaggedpine <br>
  +Jaggedpine Treefolk <br>
  +Protectors of Pine <br>
  +Guards of Qeynos</font></p><p class=MsoNormal><font face="Verdana">An easy way 
  to do this quest is to bind in Felwithe next to Elishia and then gate to 
  Surefall, run to Jaggedpine, do the turn in, gate back to Felwithe.&nbsp; 
  Repeat.</font></p><p class=MsoNormal><font face="Verdana">As you can see this 
  quest fixes many of the factions necessary in the epic quest.&nbsp; The 
  downside is this quest seems to move faction fairly slowly so you will need to 
  do this quest many many times to fix your faction in some cases.</font></p><p class=MsoNormal>
    <font face=Verdana>To fix your faction if you have killed <b>Holly Windstalker</b> in Qeynos Hills.&nbsp;</font></p><p class=MsoNormal>
    <font face=Verdana>Go to Toxxulia Forest.&nbsp; Track and hunt the Poachers.&nbsp; Collect their heads.</font></p><p class=MsoNormal style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
    <font face=Verdana>Return to Surefall Glade.&nbsp; If you are KOS be sure to be invisible when wandering otherwise these Rangers can have you dead quickly.&nbsp;</font></p><p class=MsoNormal>
    <font face=Verdana>Find Gillarian Naelev,&nbsp; Hand him the Poacher Heads.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p><p class=MsoNormal>
    <font face=Verdana>If you are KOS with Gillarian have a friend along that can cast invisibility on you.&nbsp; Now first harmony Gillarian 
  to reduce his agro range, hand him the Poacher heads but don’t hit trade!&nbsp; 
  Have your friend cast invis on you, and then hit trade.&nbsp; Just be prepared 
  to have to re-invis or run after you hit trade if still KOS.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">You can also kill Gnolls in Jaggedpine 
  for faction and turn the Gnoll teeth into Sergeant Caelin in Jaggedpine for 
  faction.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><font face=Verdana><b>Telin Darkforest</b> is the first NPC that you must talk with.&nbsp; If he will not talk to you, you need to do the following:&nbsp;</font></p><p class=MsoNormal>
    <font face=Verdana>Go to East Commons.&nbsp; In the 2<sup>nd</sup> group of Inns one of the vendors in the inn sells muffins.&nbsp; Buy as many as you can carry.&nbsp;</font></p><p class=MsoNormal>
    <font face=Verdana>Now go to West Freeport.&nbsp; There is a tavern/inn halfway between the West Freeport gates and the East Freeport Zone.&nbsp; Upstairs is a dwarf named Pandos Flintside.&nbsp; You should be able to track him if you are having difficulties finding him.&nbsp;</font></p><p class=MsoNormal>
    <font face=Verdana>Go up to him.&nbsp; If you are not KOS with Pandos just keep handing him muffins.&nbsp; You can hand him 4&nbsp; per turn.&nbsp;  </font></p><p class=MsoNormal>
    <font face=Verdana>You’ll notice your factions improving.&nbsp; It is recommended to go ahead and keep doing this until you are allied with Pandos (solves other problems later if you are).&nbsp;</font></p><p class=MsoNormal>
    <font face=Verdana>If you are KOS with Pandos this quest is still doable just going to take a little more work.&nbsp; You will need a friend along that can cast invis/camo on you.&nbsp; This is how you do it.&nbsp; Cast Harmony on Pandos to reduce his agro range.&nbsp; Go up to him, and hand him the muffins but don’t hit trade!&nbsp; Have your friend cast invisibility on you, THEN hit trade.&nbsp; It won’t take too many times of doing this that you will find your faction ok enough to not have to invis.&nbsp;</font></p><p class=MsoNormal>
    <font face=Verdana>The next NPC you might have a problem with is <b>Alrik Farsight </b>in Timorous Deep.&nbsp; If he won’t talk to you do the following quest.&nbsp;</font></p><p class=MsoNormal>
    <font face=Verdana>Go to East Commons at the Inn that is nearest the West Commons zone.&nbsp; There is a Erudite jewel vendor in one of the side houses near the inn.&nbsp; Purchase as many stacks of batwings as you can.&nbsp;</font></p><p class=MsoNormal>
    <font face=Verdana>Now go to the mage guild in South Felwithe.&nbsp; Find Niola Impholder and hand him  4 batwings 
  at a time until your faction is ally.&nbsp; Again if he won’t talk to you, do the same invis trick as the above quest.&nbsp;</font></p><p class=MsoNormal>
    <font face=Verdana>Another way to raise this faction is to kill Kizdean Gix in West Commons when he spawns.&nbsp; I would recommend when you are in West Commons and he is up to kill him in preparation for your epic.&nbsp; Just be careful with Kizdean.&nbsp; He is an undercon so don’t attack him at lower levels.</font></p><p class=MsoNormal>
    <font face=Verdana><b>Kinlo Strongarm </b>is the<b> </b>next potential problem with faction.&nbsp; If you have killed dwarves before you might have problems with him.&nbsp;</font></p><p class=MsoNormal>
    <font face=Verdana>To fix his faction is simple.&nbsp; Go into Crushbone off of Greater Fay and kill Orcs.&nbsp; You should be able to kill them very fast.&nbsp; Save the orc belts and orc legionnaire shoulder pads and turn them into Canloe Nusbeck &nbsp;for faction.&nbsp; You will need 4 belts or 4 shoulder pads at a time to turn in.&nbsp; If your faction isn’t KOS you can buy the belts and legionnaire pads from other players.</font></p><p class=MsoNormal style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
    <font face=Verdana>That is the major faction hurdles that you might need to fix.&nbsp; If I’ve missed any or someone knows a simpler way to fix faction please let me know and I’ll update this guide!</font></p></td>
