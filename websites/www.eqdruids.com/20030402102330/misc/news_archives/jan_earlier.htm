“The performance has stayed consistent througout the increase in the number of users concurrently accessing the site, keeping each guild’s portal at least as fast as most single-guild hosted solutions.”</font></div><div><font face=Verdana size=2>&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face=Verdana size=2>The service offers forums, voting, events scheduling/notification, member rosters, news feeds specific to the game a guild plays, chat and an integrated e-mail service.&nbsp; Boasting over 30 different ways to customize the appearance of a guild’s page, GuildPortal claims to be at the top of their game – and yours.&nbsp; “It’s not just fluff, either.&nbsp; If you go check out the options for customization on forum solutions, you’ll see that most if it is filler.&nbsp; It exists solely for the purpose of having something to list in the bi-weekly release notes.&nbsp; GuildPortal really offers you a full solution,” said Lewis.</font></div><div><font face=Verdana size=2>&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face=Verdana size=2>What’s on the horizon?&nbsp; “Right now, GuildPortal is working on putting together a package of Web Services based on the .NET platform.&nbsp; Once that’s done, we hope to be able to work out arrangements with game publishers so that their systems can talk to ours in near real-time.&nbsp; For example, if you create a guild in, say, EverQuest, our web services could accept information from Verant’s servers, automatically creating your guild’s web presence for you.&nbsp; Now, we haven’t spoken to any game publishers yet about this, as we want to get a working framework in place before we do.&nbsp; But it’s something we’re really very excited about.”</font></div><div><font face=Verdana size=2>&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face=Verdana size=2>Currently, GuildPortal offers free community hosting for EverQuest, Dark Age of Camelot, and Anarchy Online.&nbsp;
