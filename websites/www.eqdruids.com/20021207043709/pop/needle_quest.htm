  Knowledge</font></b></p>
  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Willamina 
  says 'The city is full of curious people all searching for something. Many 
  have struggled for a long time to find their reward. Some are not even aware 
  of what is it they are looking for, but will know it when they see it. Would 
  you care to [help] me out? It will only take a moment.'<br>
  <br>
  You say, 'I will help you'<br>
  <br>
  Willamina says 'How wonderful! To pass the time I enjoy sitting under the 
  trees and sewing together luscious fabrics. But now it seems my old sewing 
  needles have all broke or gone dull, and I require a new supply. Bolcen Tendag 
  has promised to purchase and deliver some for me, but he has not yet arrived 
  and I worry about him. If you could locate him and ask him <br>
  <br>
  Go to Bolcen<br>
  <br>
  You say, 'I have come for the needles'<br>
  <br>
  Bolcen Tendag says 'I feel just terrible that I haven't been to see Willamina 
  yet. Due to my illness I barely have the energy to stand. If you could aid me 
  in some way, I would greatly appreciate it. Mirao Frostpouch might have an 
  elixir that would help me feel better. Please seek him out and ask for it.'<br>
  <br>
  Hike further on to Mirao in the neutral part of town<br>
  <br>
  You say, 'I have come for the elixir'<br>
  <br>
  Mirao Frostpouch says 'That poor lad, he's always catching ill this time of 
  year. Unfortunately I am out of the medicine he needs right now. Perhaps if 
  you could obtain the key ingredient I am missing, I could brew up a batch for 
  you to take to him. I have heard Cador recently came into possession of some 
  black lava powder. If you can convince him to give you some, bring it to me 
  right away!'<br>
  <br>
  Hike onwards to Cador's place in the good part of town. near plane of 
  tranquility zone<br>
  <br>
  You say, 'do you have any black lava powder?'<br>
  <br>
  Oracle Cador says 'You are most astute. I do have a stock of black lava powder 
  with me, but I will only share it with those who prove themselves worthy. 
  Onirelin Gali is currently in possession of an artifact I need to better 
  commune with the spirits. Please recover it for me.'<br>
  <br>
  Go to Onirelin<br>
  <br>
  You say, 'I have come for the artifact'<br>
  <br>
  Onirelin Gali pauses for a moment and continues, 'I am aware of that which 
  Cador desires. Be wary of his ways for they are not always as they appear. 
  Nevertheless, if he thinks this artifact will bring him greater peace, he may 
  have it for a price. Certainly I have no use for it but what do I get in 
  return? I'll tell you. Narik and I used to be good friends, until he became 
  jealous of my relationship with his former companion Elisha. During our fight, 
  he marched off with one of my finest jewels, and I believe still has it. Find 
  him and ask for my jewel back. If you bring it to me, Cador may get want he 
  wants as well.'<br>
  <br>
  Then back over to the neutral part of town to Arch Mage Narik<br>
  <br>
  You say, 'I have come for the jewel'<br>
  <br>
  Arch Mage Narik slams his book shut. 'So, the snake has legs after all! Tell 
  Onirelin if he wants this back, he can come here himself and kiss my. . ., no 
  wait. I have a better idea.' He draws closer and whispers, 'Did Onirelin tell 
  you why I took this jewel? I did it in response to him taking my ladylove, 
  Elisha Dirtyshoes. We were to be married until she ran off with him. However, 
  she also ran off with my engagement ring I gave to her. It is quite valuable 
  to me, and I would be most happy to have it back. If you can procure it from 
  her, I'll give Onirelin his jewel back. He's suffered long enough, I think.'
  <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'can I have the ring'<br>
  <br>
  Elisha Dirtyshoes sighs and says, 'Tis a painful memory, for sure. My love for 
  Narik fell once I met Onirelin, but my love for him was not reciprocated. Now 
  I am left with no one to share my life, with only this ring as a reminder. 
  Narik may have it back if he desires it, but then I shall be left truly alone. 
  Boiron Ston once held a door open for me, such a handsome dwarf he is. If he 
  could only find more time to spend with me, giving up this ring would be no 
  problem at all. Do you think he likes me? Could you ask him and find out?' <br>
  <br>
  You say, 'do you like elisha dirtyshoes?'<br>
  <br>
  Boiron Ston says 'Aye, she's a pretty lass. And I am aware of her feelings 
  toward me. I haven't had the courage to approach her though. My family 
  standard has recently disappeared, and no dwarf is the same when their 
  standard is in jeopardy. Seek out Caden Zharik and demand my standard back, I 
  believe he may have lifted it from me.'<br>
  <br>
  Arrrgh.. where did I sign up to be the local constable....the dang gnome is up 
  in the inner ring outsideon a ledge..<br>
  <br>
  You say, 'I have come for the standard'<br>
  <br>
  Caden Zharik turns white with fear. 'Ah, so he sent you to rough me up, did 
  he? Fine, but you should know you couldn't hurt me any worse than Agrakath 
  Theric would! I'm in a bit of trouble you see, I owe Agrakath some money I 
  haven't got. So I stole the standard to pay him off. If you could please find 
  him and have him somehow erase my debt, I would gladly give the standard 
  back.'<br>
  <br>
  You say, 'I have come to erase the debt'<br>
  <br>
  Agrakath Theric grins and says, 'So, that weasel Caden has sent you to settle 
  his debt? And you actually agreed to this endeavor? Ha ha, very well! I shall 
  transfer the responsibility of what Caden owes me to your shoulders. I have a 
  simple job for you. Somewhere in the library there lies a book I have been 
  searching for, but it has eluded me for quite some time. I believe it can be 
  found somewhere in the upper levels. You are to venture into Myrist and seek 
  out a tome titled History of Evils: The Age of Scale, and bring it to me. Do 
  this one task for me and your debt shall be relinquished.'<br>
  <br>
  Ok... one book.... in a library. Took me a bit to find it - but it's on the 
  bottom shelf located at neg 100 pos 1000 (it's about a 30 minute respawn give 
  or take)<br>

  powder and quickly dashes it into a boiling cauldron. He then stirs it and

  Bolcen Tendag says 'Oh thank you so much.' He drinks from the bottle, then 
  reaches in his pocket and produces a set of needles. 'I believe this is what 
  Willamina is in need of. Please take these to her and give her my best.'<br>

  <br>
  Willamina takes the needles and smiles. 'Thank you so much, kind stranger. I 
  can't tell you how much you have really helped by doing this for me. It's 
  funny, you know. The entire city seems to be in a happier mood today. I can't 
  quite put my finger on it, but everyone seems to have uplifted spirits. Oh 
  well, thank you again. I have something you may find to be of use to you, if 
  you would be interested. Remember, knowledge is the key to life.'<br>
