  <font face="Arial">In the Library at Planes of Knowledge, there are tomes that 
  detail various historic events surrounding Norrath.&nbsp; Below is the tales 
  of the Unkempt Warders.</font><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>The Unkempt Warders 
  Vol. V</strong><br>
  <br>
  For several more generations, the Unkempt Warders would flourish and hold true 
  to their vows to the Lujien and Gihjna tribes. However, it would be the 
  settlement of the Jaggedpine forest that would render the peace and harmonious 
  existence of the Unkempt to one of strife and true ferocity to uphold their 
  promise and ways.<br>
  <br>
  When the human settlers dedicated to the ways of Karana established themselves 
  in the Jaggedpine forest and began to explore the surrounding areas, the 
  unkempt were revealed to the rest of Norrath in [a] flurry of brutal attacks 
  upon any whom entered their territory. Eventually, the Jaggedpine would seal 
  off its entry to the Unkempt Wood, leaving the feral tribe to its own - 
  preserving their own existence and maintaining their ways.<br>
  <br>
  For years after, the Unkempt seemed to be again at peace. They managed to 
  convert several of the Jaggedpine settlers to their ways before entry was 
  impossible, as well as a few of the scarcely wandering elves who stumbled into 
  the unkempt territory as the years passed both prior and after Wegadas' death.<br>
  <br>
  Now, they are again in unknown and unspoken turmoil. The Writ of the Wild, the 
  sacred tome of of the Unkempt, has been lost. Their ancient vows to the Lujien 
  and Gihjna tribes prevent them from seeking the tome beyond the forest 
  boundaries. The better judgment of the Gihjna elders lean away from searching 
  for material possession - for the unkempt know the tome by heart, and they may 
  continue its life and purpose through the voice and lessons, as Wegadas had 
  originally intended. </p>
