There is a high chance that we'll be upgrading many existing caster items to include focus effects, to keep casters from needing to start from scratch with their gear selections.&quot;</b></p><p><b>That was posted upon 3/21/02, it is now 5/22/02. The question that begs to be asked is where are these 'other' focus items? To date the only non summoned focus item found is the 8th Shawl quest.</b></p><p><b>You started off strong with caster balancing but lately...</b></p><p>Sorry about that. It’s no excuse, but the reality is that we have a lot going on here, E3 not the least of them. It’s one rather complicated balancing act.</p><p>But I assure you that the work on balancing continues, as does the work on the new interface and the bazaar. I’m not going to be able to give you any solid dates, but hopefully we’ll have more for you on all these items soon™.</p><p>I have heard that the next steps in caster balance will be to finish up with pets, then probably move on to the priest classes for a bit.</p><p>Our desire is to do it properly, and for that we’ll just need more time. All I can do is ask for your understanding and sympathize with your frustration. We all want this to be done so we can move on to the next thing, and the team is working very hard to make that happen.</p><p><b>About the balancing, bazaar, interface, and such &quot;issues&quot;... what I'm seeing a rather small company (Verant is still a small company, even with the backing of Sony) trying to do too many things at once. I think you'd have a better chance at getting things out on time if you'd make less &quot;promises&quot; and just started working on one project or 2 at a time. I understand research and development must go on for future projects, but I personally don't care if the bazaar and new interface come out late, but as yet they haven't come out at all. If you really have 2 full teams, one working on each project, why not merge the 2, bust out ONE project, then focus on the next?</b></p><p><b>I thought of this as a distraction to cleaning my apartment, and thinking &quot;why do I waste all my time trying to clean 4 rooms at once, when I should just clean one to completion, then hit the next?&quot;</b></p><p><b>Consider it. I'm sure you all have a lot more business training than I do, but I've run a quite successful company on my own for over 5 years now and I cannot understand the logic of spreading your resources (programmers) so thin.</b></p><p>I’m not going to E3 this year. They didn’t need me for the booth so I figured I’d stay here.</p><p>As for resources, there’s a reason we can’t just drop everyone on one project at a time. A lot of it has to do with job skills. You don’t really want our designers doing PoP art, and our programmers don’t do class balancing (though they do have their opinions…). So we just can’t toss everyone at each project.</p><p>And, using your example, it wouldn’t be all the useful to have 20 people cleaning your kitchen. With any project there’s a point where more people don’t add to the speed the work gets done, and more than that often slow things down. Heh, just picture a gaggle of artists (that’s the official term for a bunch of artists, I think) trying to model the same character…</p><p>And a lot of project timing is out of our hands. We just can’t ask them to hold off E3 for a month or two while we do other things.</p><p>I can’t wait to hear the feedback from E3. I think we’ll impress at least a few people.</p><p>- Alan</p></font><p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p align=center><b><font face=Arial><a name="Major Update to the Key Guide 5/23/02">Major Update to the Key Guide 5/23/02</a></font></b></td></tr><tr><td>I've done some major updating to our Key Guide.&nbsp; Thanks to the information from Shiba I've added how to get the keys for Grieg's End, Sssra Temple, Vex Thal.&nbsp;<p>I've also added information on how to obtain all 8 island's keys in the Plane of Air.</p><p>To see the guide you can go to the reference section or <a href=../../reference/keyquest.htm>click here</a></td></tr><tr><td><p align=center><b><font face=Arial>&nbsp; <a name="Casters Realm has review of Everquest Adventures 5/22/02">Caster's Realm has review of Everquest Adventures 5/22/02</a></font></b></td></tr><tr><td><p align=left>Caster's Realm was able to preview the upcoming Everquest Adventures (the PS/2 version of EQ) at the E3 computer show.&nbsp; This is what they had to say.</p><hr><p align=center><a href=http://eqoa.crgaming.com/editorials/vieweditorial.asp?Id=5>E3 PREVIEW, MAY 22, 2002</a></p><p>Upon sitting on the comfy leather couch within the SOE booth I was greeted by two television screens proudly displaying the EverQuest Online Adventures welcome screen.&nbsp; I was a little skeptical about how well the original EverQuest I had been a part of for over three years would translate to the console environment but I found myself getting more and more excited as the demonstration went on.</p><p>The most noticeable feature of the new game is the user interface.&nbsp; The design team spent over a year studying the most comonly used phrases within EverQuest and most of these can now be accessed through a few drop down menus and button pushes.&nbsp; Socializing was not in any way cumbersome, and picking up a couple of travelling partners to group with proved very easy and natural to accomplish.</p><p>The demonstration commenced with the creation of the character for the demonstration.&nbsp; Although EverQuest Online Adventures is based earlier in time than the original EverQuest game, current players will easily recognize the available classes.&nbsp; There is a slight variation in the humans with an option of an Eastern or Western Human but for the most part it is very similar.</p><p>Combat is much faster and very far from the look and feel of the PC.&nbsp; Spells, special attacks and other moves are quickly activated through the hand controller.&nbsp; The difficulty of the NPC encounter can be predicted through the use of a coloring system (blue, white, red, etc) and and aggression type (likes, neutral, aggressive, etc).</p><p>Players with broadband will be pleased to know the PS2 adaptor required for this game will support ethernet connections, although the game is being designed to run perfectly well on a 56K modem.</p><p>Quests are much easier to navigate with prompt menus and a journal to keep track of the original quest and your progress along it.</p><p>Basic details on items, spells and abilities are available through the menu interface.</p><p>Advancement will be limited to 50 Levels which will take at least 500 hours online to complete (20 days online).</p><p>New skills and abilities complement the Level system.&nbsp; These are acquired both through speaking with ones trainer and doing quests.</p><p>Also different to the original EverQuest, players will be able to increase their base stats as they level and the dev team are confident that stats will have more importance than they ended up having in the original PC game.</p><p>Players will have easy access to Sprit Binders who will be readily available to set their respawn points and a transportation system will also help in teleporting players around the world of Norrath.</p><p>In all the game looks great, is easy to become immersed in and still offers the wonderous world of adventure which made Norrath popular on the PC.</p><p>The game will, without a doubt, revolutionize MMOG's when it hits the PS2 late in 2002.</p><hr><p>Sounds like the PS/2 version of the game is going to be a good port of the game.&nbsp; As information continues to appear, I'll make sure to let you all know.</p><p>When the game is released I'll add a section for it so you can have one place to stop for all your information :)</p><p>&nbsp;- Spiritual</td></tr><tr><td><p align=center><b><a name="VERY IMPORTANT please read!

As part of playing around with the idea, we initiated code on the Test server that allowed casters to bind in Timorous Deep again. That was probably six weeks ago, just after we stopped patching code for such a long time.</p><p>When it came time to patch code again the change to Timorous Deep went live, in a rather untested and unintended fashion. That’s why it’s not working perfectly, and that’s why it’s working at all. ;p</p><p>After pushing forward our examination of the idea of re-enabling binding in Timorous Deep, we’ve decided to allow it. However, because the implementation wasn’t planned to go in quite yet, we haven’t assigned the time to clear out the bugs. We’ll hunt them down when we get the chance.</p><p>So my suggestion would be to hold off binding yourself there until we get a shot at testing the change and patching the bugs.</p><p>- Alan</font></td></tr></table></center></center></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p align=center><b><font face=Arial><a name="Sonys Lineup at E3 5/15/02">Sony's Lineup at E3 5/15/02</a></font></b></td></tr><tr><td><span class=smalltitle>Sony Online Entertainment's E3 Lineup</span><br> &nbsp;<center><p><B>SONY ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT CONTINUES TO LEAD THE ONLINE GAMING INDUSTRY WITH ITS NEW ROSTER OF MASSIVELY MULTIPLAYER GAMES</B></p></center><center><p>-- EverQuest® Online Adventures™ for the PlayStation®2 and EverQuest® II Lead this Year's E3 Line-up --&nbsp;</p></center><p><b>SAN DIEGO, CA - May 13, 2002</b>&nbsp;-- Next week at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), in Los Angeles, Sony Online Entertainment reinforces its commitment to multiplayer online gaming with the announcement of a ground breaking line-up, including: <I>EverQuest®: The Planes of Power™</I>, <I>PlanetSide™</I> and <I>EverQuest® II</I>.

The Dain was perma-killed to protect people from losing their shawls until last night’s patch. He is now working as intended, and should be a lot more friendly to anyone trying to assist in his cause.</p><p>Additionally I wanted to give a warning. When you give Loremaster Borannin your shawl he gives you back the same shawl and tells you to talk to the Dain. When you give your shawl to Chamberlain Krystorf or the Dain (if he happens to be up) they will return a NEW shawl. This is an exact copy of the 7th shawl, but will prevent multiple spawnings of the Dain.

Below is what the developers had to say!<p>&nbsp;- Spiritual</p><hr><p>I’m Dan Enright, Yakatizma, game designer for EverQuest.&nbsp; We’ll go around the room and take questions, comments, feedback, etc.</p><p>There’s a lot of new recipes going in on the next patch.&nbsp; Predominantly for pottery but a little bit of everything is going in.</p><p><b>Will Fletching be expanded?</b></p><p>It’s one of the better skills in terms of raising skills.&nbsp; We did add the Acrylia arrows, and I know the Acrylia drops need to be significantly increased.&nbsp; I’m unsure on exactly how much more we’ll add to this in the immediate future.</p><p><b>What plans are there to make Blacksmithing more appealing?</b></p><p>We are looking to bring a lot of the trivials down, particularly on Cultural Armor, so that these can be more of a level 20 – 30 item.&nbsp; This would have been insane once upon a time, but with the amount of item trickle that is occurring on servers these days it really isn’t a problem to do this now.</p><p>So we’ll be looking at doing a lot of trivial level revisions on a few of the tradeskills in the near future.&nbsp; Blacksmithing and Tinkering will be the first two of these we do.</p><p><b>Any words on fixing Cazic-Thule tradeskill items?</b></p><p>The no-drop stuff is something I am kind of against.&nbsp; It was the first attempt of some of the new team members working on tradeskills.&nbsp; There’s definitely some stuff there I will go back and work on to try and help inter-dependency a bit.</p><p><i><span style="COLOR: black">Note: &nbsp;Since Fan Faire the items drops were increased and the components made No Drop during the last patch.</span></i></p><p><b>Can we get poison stacking put in?</b></p><p>We still can’t get it in.&nbsp; The closest we could do is put in a bottle with charges of summon vial of poison.&nbsp; We are really looking to have some work done on poison before planes of power.&nbsp; Looking at adding things like bane poisons and stuff like that.</p><p>We’re also looking into some of the other things like being able to poison weapons for other people, being able to zone and keep your poison on your weapon, etc.&nbsp; We are keeping a close eye on suggestions for this skill.</p><p><b>Why is Jewelry the only tradeskill which makes a lot of money?</b></p><p>I think because originally we had a rule not to put in any dropped jewelry which was better than player made.&nbsp; But that’s not really the case any more.&nbsp; So we are working on revising a lot of the other tradeskills to make sure the trivial levels are set in a way which we can introduce more high level items to different tradeskills.&nbsp; We just have to find a good way to do that.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Will we see some of the imbalances between vendor buy back prices and player buy back prices on items?</b></p><p>To an extent.&nbsp; Some of these are set to encourage player trading over selling off to vendors.&nbsp; But we will be working to try and balance this a little bit better.</p><p><b>Why don’t you bring in some kind of item deterioration to make trades more demanded?</b></p><p>At this point in EverQuest that just wouldn’t be good for the game.&nbsp; As much as it might be better for the economy, the game has just been out to long to do such a radical change to the game system.</p><p><b>Which stat is used for raising skills in Blacksmithing?</b></p><p>Whichever is the highest of Intelligence, Wisdom or Strength.</p><p><b>What other skills have secondary skills like Smithing?</b></p><p>Fletching runs off Dexterity, Jewelry runs off Dexterity, Tailoring will run off Dexterity soon.&nbsp; Basically that means whichever is highest of Intelligence, Wisdom or Dexterity will be the stat checked for chances to raise skill.</p><p><b>Will enchanters see more of the Clarify Mana type spells?</b></p><p>Yes we’ll probably use them more over time.&nbsp; We already use them a fair bit in Tailoring and Pottery.&nbsp; We might use them in Brewing even one day for a super brew or something.</p><p><b>Can we ever see more than one tradeskill go above 200?</b></p><p>When we first put that in it was to encourage specialist traders to work together to achieve certain items.&nbsp; Inter-dependency just has never worked in EverQuest, people end up just wanting to max out the skills themselves most of the time.&nbsp; But now that more coders on the team are working on the tradeskill stuff we might review this.&nbsp;</p><p>There are also some tradeskill increasing items to help raise non specialist skills above 200 right now to help alleviate it a bit.</p><p>We have been talking about several ideas to address this stuff.&nbsp; One of which is raising the existing skill caps above 255 through recoding.&nbsp; Another idea is to add a completely new skill you have to raise from scratch that would make far superior products that you could only open up after reaching 200 in a skill.</p><p><b>Will we see the completion of the shawl quests?</b></p><p>The designer who made this no long works with Sony.&nbsp; But it is a high priority item that will be addressed once we go back and look at Velious.&nbsp; Right now we are focusing on fixing up the newbie cities.&nbsp; But it will be looked at.</p><p>Probably won’t get done until sometime after Planes of Power.</p><p><i><span style="COLOR: black">Note: Since Fan Faire, because of the demand for the Shawl quests one of the designers, Paul Carrico, worked hard over the past two weeks to get the 8<sup>th</sup> shawl quest completed for this Wednesdays patch (May 8<sup>th</sup>).</span></i></p><p><b>Can Alchemy be made a bit better?</b></p><p>We are looking into Alchemy a bit.&nbsp; There’s a lot of stuff involved with it we have to be careful of with infringing on other classes.&nbsp; But we are aware of some of the issues with it.</p><p>The Luclin potions which went in are really really nice, but they are also pretty difficult.&nbsp; It alleviated some of the concerns a little bit but not nearly enough.&nbsp; We might look at adjusting the durations and the negative effects on some of the buffs.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Why are some of the Luclin potions so hard to make?</b></p><p>There were some, like the clarity one, which could only be put into the game on the proviso that you needed the AAXP Alchemy in order to make them fairly regularly.</p><p><b>Why do some of the tradeskills have such large trivial gaps for raising skills?</b></p><p>We are looking into this.&nbsp; Jewelry and Fletching are pretty good for this, but Tailoring and Tinkering are still pretty bad.&nbsp; We’ll be addressing this in the near future.</p><p><b>Will we ever see Acrylia or new Gems added to jewelcraft?&nbsp; Any further use of enchanted gems planned?</b></p><p>Originally there weren’t any plans for it.&nbsp; There are some ideas for it which have been tossed around but I don’t foresee a close ETA for it just because a lot of other tradeskills need more attention than jewelcraft.</p><p>But we are certainly at looking at using some of the imbued gems and enchanted gems in more things than just jewelcraft.&nbsp; Pottery in particular could be using some of these more in the near future.</p><p><b>Is elemental damage actually working?</b></p><p>There are some problems with it.&nbsp; We are continuing to look at it and work out kinks.</p><p><b>Will Planes of Power have much for tradeskills?</b></p><p>Yes.&nbsp; Planes of Power will have <u>a lot</u> for tradeskills.&nbsp; I can’t say much more than that at the moment.</p><p>It will apply to players of all levels.&nbsp; Some of the new stuff will be planar tradeskills which may even be required in order to complete some of the planes.</p><p><b>Can we get the ability to add more colors to Banded like we have with Fine Steel?</b></p><p>The way our tinting system works it just requires a lot of time to do.&nbsp; It took us 2 months working 40+ hours a week to get the fine steel stuff in.&nbsp; Until we get a better system or tools I can’t see it happening.</p><p><b>Can we see the Gnome Shadow Knights and Paladins get the ability to use the Clock Work Tinkered armor?</b></p><p>Yes.&nbsp; They should be able to, I’ll check into getting that added.</p><p><b>Do you foresee Tradeskills being added which will appeal to the high end player?</b></p><p>Well it’s a unique situation in EverQuest.&nbsp; I’d personally love to see tradeskill and quest items be the best, with drop items being the lowest.&nbsp; On top of that I’d add in degradation so there was a constant demand for the tradesman.&nbsp; Which is why baking is one of my favorite EverQuest tradeskill.&nbsp; The only way I’d improve that is to reduce the availability of food on vendors, which players would hate.&nbsp; But you can get foods which last 100 times longer than some vendor bought foods.</p><p>We are looking at ways to make high end tradeskill products more appealing.</p><p><b>Do certain races and classes consume food at different rates?</b></p><p>There are some.&nbsp; Trolls and Ogres<b><span style="COLOR: #3366ff"> </span></b>eat food and drink faster, monks do it slower.&nbsp; Some races are different too.</p><p><b>Can we see ores made stackable?</b></p><p>I have no problem with that.&nbsp; We really need more storage space on characters.&nbsp; The problem is that the programming changes needed to be done are really scary.&nbsp;&nbsp; We may just look at a way to expand the bank space, but even that would require a lot of reworking.</p><p>It’s definitely a high desirable on the development team, it’s brought up countless times each week.</p><p><b>How was the Vendor system going to work?</b></p><p>Basically you leave your character online and standing there but you would go into an NPC mode where people can click on you and the trades take place based upon the prices you set on the items when you go into that mode.</p><p>It will come in sometime after the new interface is released.</p><p><b>Will we ever have a way to reset tradeskill specialization?</b></p><p>I don’t think so.&nbsp; It’s not really a good thing to do considering the costs of raising some of the skills.&nbsp; We’d rather look more into the advanced tradeskills route and then allowing more (or all) of the existing tradeskills going up to 255.</p><p>The strongest argument for it is due to people who accidentally get the wrong specialization.&nbsp; We’ll look into it.</p><p><b>Will gnomes ever get the tinkered Blunderbuss?</b></p><p>Every expansion I have asked if it is yet time for the Gnomish Blunderbuss.&nbsp; Maybe Planes of Power will be the time.&nbsp; We’ll see.</p><p><b>Will we see more combined tradeskill items?</b></p><p>Yes.&nbsp; I like the idea of this sort of thing.. One of my favorite ideas right now is to use pottery and jewelry together to make focus items.&nbsp;</p></font><p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p align=center><b><font face=Arial><a name="EQ 2 Site and New Everquest Live online 5/2/02">EQ 2 Site and New Everquest Live online 5/2/02</a></font></b></td></tr><tr><td><font face=Arial>Sony have put up a new site, and redesigned another site :)</font><p><font face=Arial>Everquest Two site has been launched, it can be seen <a href=http://everquest2.station.sony.com/>here</a></font></p><p><font face=Arial>And the Everquest Live site has been redesigned!&nbsp; It can be seen <a href=http://eqlive.station.sony.com/>here</a></font></p><p><font face=Arial>Nice job Hammerfel!!</font></p><p><font face=Arial>I would definitely visit the EQ2 site and read the letter from John Smedly, it is a good read!</font></p><p><font face=Arial>&nbsp;- Spiritual</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face=Arial><b><a name="PC Gamer has Everquest 2 information 5/1/02">PC Gamer has Everquest 2 information 5/1/02</a></b></font></td></tr><tr><td><font face=Arial>The June 2002 issue of PC Gamer is out, with an article about Everquest 2!</font><p><font face=Arial>I would suggest to everyone to buy this issue, some really great info on EQ2 in it.&nbsp; I'm going to post the highlights</font></p><ul><li><font face=Arial>The 3 original continents will be available to players</font></li> <li><font face=Arial>The background is that Freeport has succumbed to evil influences with the paladins thrown out.&nbsp; Iksar homeland has been wiped out and no Vah Shir (but you will be able to play Kerran).&nbsp; 50 percent of the games zones will be new.</font></li> <li><font face=Arial>No stat points or classes at char creation.&nbsp; At level 6 you will choose fighter, priest, mage rogue or tradesman.</font></li> <li><font face=Arial>Level 15 you start to specialize your char.</font></li> <li><font face=Arial>Level 30 you make final decision about what role your char will play.</font></li> <li><font face=Arial>100 possible levels (vs 60 in EQ)</font></li> <li><font face=Arial>Tradeskills will be of major value to players, and tradeskill created items will be some of the better in game.</font></li> <li><font face=Arial>Twinking will be VERY hard to do.&nbsp; You will need proficiencies in weapons and such before being able to wield fully, so level 10 will wield item MUCH differently than a level 50</font></li> <li><font face=Arial>Exp loss from deaths will be handled much differently</font></li> <li><font face=Arial>Banks will not be linked.&nbsp; You will have to move items between banks, allowing for more merchant play in the game.</font></li> <li><font face=Arial>Player owned property!
