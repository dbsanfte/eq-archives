<p>1. Find the <b> Black Reavers</b> in City of Mist.&nbsp; The Jade Reaver is a
semi-rare drop off of the Black Reaves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Black reaver ranges from 50 - 53 and has almost 100% Magic
Resistance.&nbsp; Once killed another Black Reaver will spawn on its corpse and
will be a little tougher than the prior.&nbsp; Although there are only five
reavers in the zone and they are on a 2 hour timer, you have more than five
chances for a reaver due to this respawning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>They spawn behind a door
that must be picked by a rogue of 51 or higher.&nbsp; You can pull them to the
archway with a group of six if done correctly.&nbsp; Best group I have used was
an Enchanter, Cleric, Rogue, Monk, Warrior, Warrior.&nbsp; All 52+ (And the druid stands
alone...LOL)&nbsp; Black Reavers will drop this item:</p>

<p align="left">(Note: This item can be purchased as it is no NO DROP)</p>
<p align="left">(Often at the end of the Black Reaver spawns they will spawn a
ghostlike creature of some kind.&nbsp; There are several that spawn but there is
one in particular that you should avoid if you are using one group.&nbsp; Rak
Ashiir is a floating spectre that can Complete Heal and 2K Rain Damage so if he
spawns stay away.&nbsp; He will be indifferent to you and even allow you to keep
killing all other things in the zone.&nbsp; Just make sure nobody hits him with
anything.&nbsp; I have done CoM several times while leaving Rak Ashiir standing
next to us.&nbsp; For more detailed info on how to kill Rak Ashiir please visit
my friends at everquest.allakhazam.com)</p>
<p align="left">2. Find <b> Kinlo Strongarm</b> in Kaladim's Everhot Forge.&nbsp;
This
is in North Kaladim.&nbsp; Tell him &quot;Do it for me.&quot; and he should tell
you that he wants a shiny axe in return.&nbsp; If he does not you must alter
faction, which is talked about below this pic.&nbsp; Hand him your Jade Reaver and you will receive this enchanted
clay:<br>
</p>

<p align="left">(*Note to Dorf Killers:&nbsp; Yes I was one too so don't feel
bad.&nbsp; Now everyone talks about raising faction to do this part or having a
Enchanter charm this NPC to turn in the Jade Reaver but here is my
suggestion.&nbsp; I was very KOS to guards and very KOS to citizens.&nbsp; I
invis'ed myself and headed for Everhot Forge.&nbsp; Everyone in there conned
dubiously when I dropped the invis.&nbsp; They would not sell to me but Kinlo
gave me the quest anyhow.&nbsp; I suggest trying this first and if he does not
respond then either kill orcs in Crushbone or try having an Enchanter charm
Kinlo to turn in your item.&nbsp; But I have not verified that charming Kinlo
works.</p>
<p align="left">3. Find a pottery wheel in any major city (Rivervale has one for
sure).&nbsp; Combine the Enchanted Clay, Ancient Pattern, and Platinum Speckled
Powder in the pottery wheel.&nbsp; No skill is required and you will create
this:</p>
