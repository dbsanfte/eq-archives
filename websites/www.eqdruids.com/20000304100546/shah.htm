: I have kept this guide exactly how its was written cause it is good info and it needed a
home.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times"></p>

<p>This was written by Shahlateah, Half-Elf Druidess of the 27th Circle.&nbsp; It is
designed to inform other classes of the benefit that may be derived from having a Druid in
the group, as well as give suggestions to other group members on how to expect a druid to
react in certain situations&nbsp; Information herein can be used with Shaman classes as
well and is mostly set down for OUTDOORS, but some tactics can sill be used indoors.
&nbsp;&nbsp; I also disregard level in this because the Snailing technique does NOT
require SoW.</font> </p>

<p><b><font color="#008000" face="Times New Roman, Times" size="+1">Summoned items</font><font color="#008000" face="Times New Roman, Times">:</font></b> </p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times">Food and Water, but why?&nbsp; Rations are very
inexpensive, don't penny pinch. Druids usually forage food anyway.</font> </p>

<p>Shah adds : Summoning food and water is really a great skill increaser and good for<br>
situations of death.<br>
<br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times"><b><font color="#008000"><font size="+1">Traveling</font>:</font></b>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>SOW - Spirit of the Wolf</b></font> <br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times">Although a few other classes obtain similar abilities,
only the druid is true to this skill.&nbsp; We have all seen that Bards are far superior
with their speed song in later levels, yet there comes many problems associated with songs
where a Druid remains master of Speed along with the Shaman.&nbsp; In many fights, or in
traveling, a bard can easily slip out of range and the effect of the song is lost.
&nbsp;&nbsp; If at the same time someone had a SoW cast on them the effect has just been
nulled out by the bard going out of range also.&nbsp; This has been tested and confirmed.
&nbsp;&nbsp; So if you have both a Druid and a Bard in a group, make the initial decision
of SoW for when you a hunting, and Bard Speed for travel.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>Tips</b> on how to NOT annoy a Druid or Shaman
with SoW requests:</font> <br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times">1)&nbsp; IF your not grouped with a DRU/SHM don't
constantly go up to one asking for SoW, even if you are donating, it really gets old and
don't be surprised to suddenly hear, &quot; I really need to save my mana for my
group.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times">2) IF your fighting RIGHT at a ZONE point, don't
ask for as soon as it runs out.&nbsp; If a time comes up when you really have to zone, SoW
wont get you there any quicker right at the zone point.&nbsp; There is nothing more
annoying than being OOM, 20 feet from the zone point with half health and three people
give a 'Need SoW' tell.</font> </p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times">Rings and Circles - Teleport</font></b> <br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times">With these spells a Druid is able to move almost
instantaneously to another continent, and later with the Circle spells is able to teleport
a full group as well.&nbsp; It has been clearly stated that simple possession of this
skill does NOT turn a druid into a ferry service for travel.&nbsp; Requesting teleport
should ONLY be in an emergency situation or if you are already grouped with someone going
a certain direction.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>Succor - Flee</b></font> <br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times">Big BIG trouble has arrived and everyone is almost
completely drained.&nbsp; With luck and enough mana, as druid can Whisk the whole party
away to another zone.</font> </p>

<p><font size="+1" color="#008000" face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>Healing:</b></font> </p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times">Druids in combination with the other skills also
have many restorative skills.&nbsp; Healing, curing, and resistance's are part of the
ensemble.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lets point out some things.&nbsp; First off, let me make a point for
all healers.&nbsp; At the end of a battle, and people have about a bubble of health gone,
leave them alone, your time is better off getting your health back while you meditate.
&nbsp; Here is the scenario:</font> <br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times">Each player has 1 bubble of health down.&nbsp; A
healer has 1/2 of his mana and heals everyone to full.&nbsp; Now the healer is OOM and is
useless for a while for heals..&nbsp; A battle immediately starts.&nbsp; One person gets
POUNDED big time!&nbsp; Healer is OOM and everyone else is full health and NO ONE can get
the MOB off this guy before it is killed.&nbsp; Good-bye party member, you are now dust.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let those people regain their health while you are on your way to full
mana. It makes complete sense!&nbsp; Its much better to have 6 people regenerating 5
points a round(30 points) then to have one healer completely drained and getting only 5
points.</font> <br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times">DON'T top people off, it increases YOUR downtime
healers!</font> </p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times">Curing and Endurance's can be very vital in a party
when fighting certain creatures.&nbsp; Also later on don't forget your cancel magic spell
when fighting creatures who use Damage over time spells(ex.HEAT BLOOD)</font> </p>

<p><b><font size="+1" color="#008000" face="Times New Roman, Times">Combat</font><font color="#008000" face="Times New Roman, Times">: </font></b><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times">Where to even begin, I guess here.&nbsp; I consider
myself an excellent druid, which means I still need skill points to become a master and so
forth.&nbsp; In that light, take my confidence and seeming arrogance as instruction.</font>
<br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times">First off, a druid can be several things to a group. </font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times">1) An addition to melee damage and a person to take
damage for a bit while things are brought back under control.</font> <br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times">2) A healer for the group, or a backup healer if a
cleric is grouped.</font> <br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times">3) A Spell damage dealer.</font> <br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times">4) A sacrificial group member.</font> <br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times">5) A battle captain, or tide turner.</font> <br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times">6) A fetcher, or lure person.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times">Dictionary:</font> <br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>Pegged</b>:&nbsp; Player is hated more than anyone
else and anytime he gets close to the monster it will take off toward the pegged player.
&nbsp; One becomes pegged by using certain spells and especially in combinations. Also is
pegged by doing more initial damage to a monster.</font> <br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>DoT</b>&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage over Time</font> <br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>BRB</b> -&nbsp; Be right back, Bathroom Break, or
if running a creature it means you to a break and gather your wits because the monster is
being taken out of range by the DRU/SHM.</font> <br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>INC</b> -&nbsp;&nbsp; This just means that a
monster has been found and tagged.&nbsp; IT DOES NOT MEAN GET UP in Druid terms! A monster
is tagged so any other people luring should then CEASE hunting and return to the
designated camp spot</font> <br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>ENGAGED</b> - Druid luring is IN RANGE NOW. &nbsp;
GET UP and be aware of the battle plans.</font> <br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>RES</b> -&nbsp; This indicated that a spell is
RESISTED.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times">I guess I'll hit each and then pop in with
explanations of various Druidic battle tactics and why they are great.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times">1)&nbsp; <b>Partial Tank</b> - Druids have mid
range hit points.&nbsp; They don't have a ton, but they do have enough that they can take
quite a few beatings before they need help.&nbsp; During this time the healers can focus
their heals on the real tanks and they can then take over again.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times">2)&nbsp; Druids healing spells are gained slower
than a cleric but are just as valuable.&nbsp; No offense intended to other healers and
their methods but if your party members are getting hit and you are half health. You
should be healing THEM and NOT yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Keeping everyone else alive is your
goal as a healer, as the melee and casters of the group the others are to keep you free
for healing.&nbsp; Make a hot key that will notify your group that you are unable to heal,
or are engaged.&nbsp; Mine says simply, &quot; ENGAGED....&nbsp; ENGAGED....&quot; and the
people I group with know that I will not heal myself until THEY are out of danger.
&nbsp;&nbsp; If they see me hit the hot key one time, it means that I am in range of them
AND I have a creature on me.&nbsp; If its in the middle of a battle and I'm being pounded
and can't heal, I let out several ENGAGED MSG's and that ALWAYS pulls a TANK, or another
group member to my aide.&nbsp; Let your group know what your messages are for, and get to
know their signals because they are vital. As I already said about healers not topping off
your health, don't ask or expect a Druid to top your health off UNLESS you are a low hit
point caster, and even then, if they don't top you off please don't ask because it's very
likely they are more interested in obtaining mana at that moment more than spending it.
TARGET OUT OF RANGE - DOH!&nbsp; When you are in need of a heal, make SURE you are
relatively close to your healer.&nbsp; Sit down a couple of times and LISTEN to the a
healer casting HEAL.. Its sound is distinct, and if you hear it and you are the most hurt,
or running to a zone point, STOP for a second.. If your not too close to the zone and your
health is low. You KNOW your going to die?&nbsp; Hear that heal spell being cast? STOP..
It might be being cast on YOU and you might just make it.. If you go out of range, the
healer still burned his mana and you still died.</font> <br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times">Got a designated healer in the group while a monster
has you pegged?&nbsp; If they know their position in the group and are playing as a team,
then TRUST the HEALER to heal you when you come in range, and give them time to get their
spell off..</font> </p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times">3)&nbsp; Druids have fairly decent damage spells
and can do considerably more damage than their melee abilities. IMO one of the best spells
Druids have under their belt is their line of DoT spells..&nbsp; There is nothing more
pleasing to here everyone yell OOM, and everyone so low on health to make a run for zone
then up comes, 'You gain party experience', a SO-and-SO died.&nbsp; DoT's are deadly and
carry guaranteed damage. Not to mention VERY intimidating in a duel...&nbsp;&nbsp; Heh,
don't duel a druid outside. Even one that cons green.&nbsp; Druids can solo hard reds NO
PROB. Another line of spells we have is Area effect which isn't all that great IMO except
to draw the Mobs off others. WIND spells, Nice FULL damage spells that stun a creature for
about a second or two.&nbsp; They ALWAYS deal full damage when they hit and work well at
ticking off a monster.&nbsp; VERY good for Snailing that you will see later. This also
interrupts casting and a druid should always use this on an offensive enemy caster when
possible. Its also quite entertaining to witness a monster hop in the hair for no apparent
reason.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times">4)&nbsp; I M O, a druid is a member of the group
that is SACRIFICEABLE if at all possible.&nbsp; I've gotten to the point to where I want
people I group with the know to save themselves before dying for me.&nbsp; The effort they
put in saving me is nice, but I would rather be the one to die because I know I have more
of a chance of surviving than the average class.&nbsp; Early on in my levels I obtain a
spell called SNARE.&nbsp; If I get in trouble the first thing I do is attempt a snare
spell which will allow me to outrun a creature WITHOUT SoW.&nbsp; Sometimes its a 50/50
deal, if Successful I live, if not I still may not die.. I've got GATE at level 5 and ROOT
and WIND Stun, SoW and later CHEETAH.&nbsp; My chances of survival are 5 to 10 times
better when in RUN AWAY mode.&nbsp;&nbsp; IF a Druid in your party follows this way and
they tell you ZONE.. Do it then, its a whole lot easier for 1 Druid to regain a bubble of
experience then to have 2 members die trying to save one.. Now again.. This SACRIFICE
deal.. It's MY OPINION. Don't want to do it?&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't, period.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times">5 &amp; 6)&nbsp; These two go hand in hand, A druid
can be a highly quick and successful hunter in the outdoors.&nbsp; Druids have long range
DoT spells that really tick monsters off in order to lure.&nbsp; They can lure out a good
distance where a party waits in ambush, and where you can be free from Loose Caster
cannons(Kill Stealers). With the hot keys and signals a druid can bring constant picked
creatures to a party, fight half of the battle and immediately head back out to retrieve
more prey.&nbsp; Although your party is still camping somewhere else, it still does not
cause the clutter of a camping group standing right at a spawn point. In these cases of
campers, I personally have a tactic that I use called hit and run..&nbsp; Its my favorite
lure technique to use around people camping a spawn spot.&nbsp; Its so very fun to hit my
cheetah spell, zoom in to a creature that just spawned, whack it, gain some distance, and
then do a quick burn so it pegs me.&nbsp; They never know what happened considering
Cheetah is probably SOW x 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; You don't have to use cheetah but its really
funny to hear someone camping a spawn to say you stole it.&nbsp; I've had several times to
reply with, &quot;Yes, I did take that one because I was faster and it had not been
attacked yet. You may consider befriending a Druid.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
Fight Moderation, very similar to an enchanter in this idea, a druid can snare, root, and
cause creatures to focus attacks elsewhere.&nbsp; Try letting a good druid be your leader,
and especially one who will die for everyone.</font> <br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times">Tide Turner, a druid has the ability to lure with
mastery creatures in open spaces while the other members concentrate on other creatures.
&nbsp; This is a method calling running a monster.</font> <br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times">EX 1.&nbsp; Aviak City, South Karanas..&nbsp; I lure 1
creature that is right next to another, both are very tough creatures and it would be
better if the majority of the party only had to deal with one at a time.&nbsp; Druid
snares ONE while in range of the group and continues on with the other tagging behind him.
&nbsp; A successful division of the enemy has been made.&nbsp; Success of BOTH enemy's
death is now 100% with NO casualties.</font> <br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times">EX 2.&nbsp; Hey! We were meditating! Who brought that
Cyclops by here!&nbsp; A SoWd Druid can immediately tick the Cyclops off by snaring! Come
on Cyclops, lets go for a walk while my group keeps preparing to ANNIHILATE you!!</font> <br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times">EX 3.&nbsp; Creatures friends popping in uninvited!
&nbsp; Same deal, Snare it! Draw it away. When the group is ready bring it back.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times">All examples are great crowd control!&nbsp; Many
more, that go with differing tactics. Tactics is now my topic..&nbsp; Enjoy..</font> </p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times">Some people have various names for specific
tactics, and my main one is Snailing with groups or solo and then baseball with only one
other partner.&nbsp; Every now and then when I see something deep red I know I can take, I
will combine Snailing and kiting.</font> </p>

A I L I N G</b></font> </p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times">This tactic is BY FAR my favorite and MOST
successful of ALL techniques for groups and solo, and I prefer this over Kiting. &nbsp;
When I snail a creature I always DoT the mob first to lure.&nbsp; I take the creature to
where I will be fighting it and immediately snare it.&nbsp; I will NOT attack it until I
snare it.&nbsp;&nbsp; ONCE creature is Snared it is now considered TAGGED. Upon snare I
back up and proceed to decimate.&nbsp; In groups, do NOT use root in combination with
snare, rooting a monster makes it berserk and once its free of root, it also breaks free
of snare and it not a pretty sight.</font> </p>

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>Group Snailing:</b></font> <br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times">DoT, Snare, then WIND!&nbsp; YOUR PEGGED! Stay JUST in
range of creature in order to keep him trailing you.. I usually run backwards in front of
my party from right to left and then back again.&nbsp; Upon a finished circle, RECAST
SNARE.&nbsp; Your party will ANNIHILATE the opponent! After enemy death you should be able
to hit the hunt immediately right after.</font> <br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>Healers:</b> Watch the pegged trailers health!
Don't let them get too low!&nbsp; The druid should be in range frequently and therefore
SHOULD remain at least at 80% health..</font> <br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>TANKS:&nbsp; </b>Kind of nice to not take so much
damage for a change, no?&nbsp; Well this time around you are all back stab! &nbsp;&nbsp;
Follow the creature around and get in those back blows!</font> <br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>Casters:&nbsp; </b>Stay safe from the Deep Red mob
your fighting?&nbsp; Cast medium spells until the creature is half dead.&nbsp; The druid
will stay pegged and you will stay able to let off a big bang at the end.&nbsp; You don't
ALWAYS have to use your biggest NUKE!</font> </p>

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>Solo Snailing:</b></font> <br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times">DoT your prey, draw to Camp, Snare, Lightning, go far
enough away that you barely see the creature, face it, dump down in meditation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Watch the creatures health bar while you MED, as soon as it moves down
you KNOW your prey is now moving close to melee range. Hit 'I' twice so you don't lose
your target and then veer off to the right or left..&nbsp; This WILL take practice!</font>
<br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times">When you are far enough to cast another snare, do so,
then either cast another DoT(if other has had enough time) OR cast a LIGHTNING or WIND
spell..&nbsp; Again, go out of range and med up until time to do again. This works
a lot better than kiting IMO and takes less time and gives you opportunity to recover mana in
the process.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times"><b><font size="+1">BASEBALL!</font></b>(Bear with
me on the symbolism)</font> <br>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times">The pitcher then runs the ball back down the field
where he either uses a big burn, or a DoT if the other has had time.&nbsp; Then Snare

There are a few other techniques that regard using Charm, and panic animal, but frankly
your a druid.. <br>
I think I will make an alternate tactic list for the chaotic druid, or the rebel druid,
but that's another story.. </p>
