<p>1) <b><u><font color="#808000">Skin Like Wood</font></u></b>. This is an excellent buff
spell. It improves slightly as your skill increases. Its effect is to add about 4 to your
overall Armor Class, and 10 +1/level hp to your hit point total. A must have spell. I keep
it in effect all the time, but as with other buff spells I memorize it only as I need it
and then un-memorize it to use the slot for something else. It is eventually replaced by
Skin Like Rock. </p>

<p>Twylight : Always keep this up buff your party with it.&nbsp; Low mana and in
melee this could be the
edge you need.&nbsp; Note that Rock/Wood are not stackable.&nbsp; However Coat/Skin are.</p>

<p>2) <b><u><font color="#808000">Burst of Flame</font></u></b>. A minor burn spell. It
costs 7 mana to cast and only does 3-6 or so damage, but it&#146;s not much different than
the other classes first burn spell. Comes in as a useful supplement to your melee attack.
You have to time it so you begin casting immediately after the monster attacks to improve
your chance of not getting interrupted. A must have spell until you get better. </p>

<p>Rupert Furrytoes: This spell is great as a lure spell. It doesn't do much damage but it
sure beats chasing down things.</p>

<p>3) <b><u><font color="#808000">Minor Healing</font></u></b>. Again, this spell is
pretty much the same as other 1<sup>st</sup> rank healing spells. It does a fine job for
the first five levels or so, but after that it becomes useless to heal people in combat,
because the monsters can dish out so much more damage than this spell can heal.
Unfortunately Druids don&#146;t get anything better until 9<sup>th</sup> level. Its still
useful from 5<sup>th</sup>-8<sup>th</sup> as an after combat restoration spell, although
you have to cast it many many times. Once you get Light Healing you won&#146;t use this
spell much (at least I don&#146;t). This spell heals 10 pts of dmg.</p>

<p>4) <b><u><font color="#808000">Flame Lick</font></u></b>. A very minor DOT (Damage Over
Time) spell. It doesn't do much damage, but its most beneficial effect is to reduce the AC
of the target by a few points, which can make a difference at the lower levels. It
requires a fire beetle eye to cast, but it does NOT consume it after each casting. A
fellow Druid by the name of Tanas wrote and told me this is an extremely useful spell to
use at the lower levels. It is best to use it as an &quot;opener&quot; to draw the monster
to you, so it's AC has been lowered before you engage it in melee.</p>

<p>Twylight : Can still be used at higher levels - does about 20 damage and lowers
AC...cost nothing basically to cast </p>

<p>Rupert Furrytoes: This spell prevents the target from regenerating hps during battle in
case you happen to miss a lot. In addition to this, the lower a target's ac the higher
chance you have of hitting for max dmg more often.</p>

<p>5) <b><u><font color="#808000">Snare</font></u></b>. This is a very good spell. . In
effect it halves the speed of an adversary. It only costs 20 mana. I used it to fight in
Steamfont against skeletons and earth elementals, and it is resisted about 30% of the
time, but the low mana cost means you can cast it several times without burning too much
mana. Once the monster is ensnared you do the &quot;Run, turn and burn&quot; routine until
it is dead or injured enough to take out with melee. This spell is also an excellent
&quot;finisher&quot; against monsters that have a tendency to run when they get low on hit
points. Rather than use an expensive burn spell to kill them, cast snare. Because the
monster is wounded it slows down to a creeping pace, and once it is damaged to 1/4 health
it stops moving altogether. A beneficial side effect of this is even though the monster is
no longer moving it is still in &quot;flee&quot; mode and will not attack you. You can
finish it off with melee attacks at your leisure. </p>

<p>Twylight : Always have this ready - costs little and should be a prime job of the druid
in groups and solo.&nbsp; Snare monsters BEFORE they start to run.</p>

<p>Rupert Furrytoes: Until Verant fixes the duration of the root spells, I suggest only
using this. </p>

<p>6) <b><u><font color="#808000">Endure Fire</font></u></b>. This is another long lasting
buff spell, so feel free to cast it during your &quot;buff&quot; phase prior to going
adventuring. It only costs 20 mana so its pretty reasonable for as long as it lasts. For
testing purposes I attacked a few Ebony Drakes in Steamfont and the damage I took from
them was significantly less than when I went in without this spell, so it does a good job.
However it is important to note that it does NOT convey immunity, it just reduces the
damage. </p>

<p>7) <b><u><font color="#808000">Lull Animal</font></u></b>. Tanas highly recommended
this spell to deal with those annoying plague rats in Steamfont. Therefore I picked it up
and headed to Steamfont. I partnered up with a Magician (first time I did that, they are
a pretty cool class). Unfortunately I didn&#146;t know how to properly use the spell at
first and got my partner killed. I blasted a skeleton, and when two rats joined the fight
I thought I would lull them so we could take on the skel. Wrong move. Lull Animal does NOT
work in combat, just like Gate. It is essential to cast it BEFORE combat, which is kind of
lame because you have to guess which animals are going to potentially gang up on you.
Anyway, once I started using it properly it worked fine. I would find a skeleton, and if
he had Plague Rats near him I would Lull the rats and then blast the skeleton. However, if
you would rather attack first and see what animals might join the fray, you can use&#133; </p>

<p>8) <b><u><font color="#808000">Panic Animal</font></u></b>. Same mana cost as Lull
Animal and you can cast it in combat. It makes the rats run away, which is good. I kept
this one memorized instead of Lull Animal. </p>

<p>Update: This spell continues to be useful well beyond the newbie levels. Although it is
sort of &quot;specialized&quot; in that you only memorize it when you know you might
encounter tough animals, it has saved my partner&#146;s and my life several times. We were
fighting crocodiles and caimans in the Oasis of Marr. Those suckers can be tough. Several
times we were on the losing side of things and I would fire off a panic animal and it
would run away, thus allowing us to rest up or zone or both. Any monster that conn&#146;ed
yellow or less I could Panic without it resisting. However the deepwater crocodiles, which
con red, resisted every time. Much like Ward Summoned, in the right circumstances this is
a great spell. </p>

<p>9) <b><u><font color="#808000">Sense Animals</font></u></b>. A spell that I struggle to
find a use for. When cast it spins your body around and points you in the direction of the
nearest animal, and targets that animal as well. Unfortunately its not like tracking where
you get to pick from a list of potential targets, it automatically selects the nearest
one. Some might say you can use it as a newbie to find animals and go kill them, but
that&#146;s not very Druid-like is it?&nbsp; - This spell can be used to find a spawn
point if you are lost - still kind of useless IMHO ; )</p>

<p>Twylight : Stand in town and cast this a bunch to raise your divination.</p>

<p>10) <b><u><font color="#808000">Dance of Fireflies</font></u></b>. This spell creates a
globe of light that you can place in an inventory slot. It works well if you do not have
Infravision. Since I&#146;m a wood elf and can see at night anyway, its only purpose for
me is to raise Conjuration skill - great for getting those 14 dots. </p>
