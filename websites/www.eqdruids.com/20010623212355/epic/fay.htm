<p>1. Find the <b>Corrupted Seahorse</b> in Kedge Keep.&nbsp; He will have seahorses as
placeholders and will spawn the tainted seahorse before the corrupted.&nbsp;
These seahorses are nasty and they are clerics which means they are quite upset
about doing CR and rezzes all day long. =P&nbsp; But seriously they have
Complete heals so be on your toes stunners in the group.&nbsp; They spawn near
the setup area for Estella.&nbsp; Only need one
good group to do this.&nbsp; Kill him and recieve this:</p>

will have seaflury Cyclops as placeholders.&nbsp; Whack him down and you will
recieve this:</p>

<p align="left">3. Find the <b>Corrupted Brownie</b> in lesser Faydark.&nbsp; He has
brownie scouts as placeholders and there are 3 of them that run in the same
pattern in the middle of the zone.&nbsp; Only certain tainted brownies will
spawn the corrupted but I have yet to figure out which ones.&nbsp; Wolf form
will keep you from being agro and you will need the help of a group as they are
Druid and we all know the power of a druid =).&nbsp; Kill him and receive this:</p>

<p align="left">4. Turn these 3 items into the Pained Unicorn in Lesser Faydark
and recieve this:</p>

mines.</p>
