<FONT COLOR="#333399" face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">Waldin<BR>Registered User<BR>(5/16/01 2:40:30 am)<BR>Reply  How do you hunt snow cougars in Iceclad?<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> I'm a level 34 druid with 184 WIS. I tried twice now to hunt snow cougars in Iceclad, both tries ending with me gating out, barely alive, and no XP gained. Obviously I'm doing something wrong.<BR><BR>1) Resists: Are snow cougars more magic resistant than the creatures of the old world? Are they especially resistant to fire based spells like Immolate and Combust? What spells should I use against them, what spells should I NOT use against them.<BR><BR>2) Escape: Can you save yourself by zoning out of Iceclad? I only was on the first island, with the gnomish pirate wannabees in the igloos. Obviously there is no zone border there, and I was afraid to run through the whole unknown zone to escape at the other end. Are there any "guards" that could eliminate the cougars for you if something goes wrong? Will the gnomes kill the cougars if you pull them there?<BR><BR>3) Strategy: I tried Ensnare, Root, double DoT and didn't get very far with that strategy. Too many resists, to many adds. Would nuking be better than DoTing here? Should I use Terrorize Animal, or is that just inviting a horde of cats after me? Would charming a cougar and letting him fight against another one help? I don't think I have enough mana to quadkite them yet. <BR> <BR>Stumblefoot<BR>Registered User<BR>(5/16/01 5:39:54 am)<BR>Reply  Cougars<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> If you are doing them one at a time then I would suggest Snare,Root,DOT. Stick with Drones of doom. try not to nuke too much. and med while the baddie is Dotted and rooted. A better place to do this might be at Middle island with tower. if you head towards it from the Gnomes you will see a solitary tree near cliffside. Pull your mobs down the cliff and do your roo/snare/Dot thing there where there are no wanderers.<BR>At 35 start quadding. And no there are no guards in IC that offer any safety. <BR> <BR>Mathue73<BR>Registered User<BR>(5/16/01 9:04:26 am)<BR>Reply <BR>  Re: How do you hunt snow cougars in Iceclad?<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> No guards and no zone. Gate is only option if running. I was quadding at 35 here. Not too many resists, not enough to make an impact anyways. I can't help ya at 34 cause I didn't come till 35 but I can offer advice on 35. Behind the gnomes camp is a nice beach, perfect for quad kiting or even regular kiting. No spawns so no adds. Grab the kitty's and pull them down there. I can't always get 4 but can always get 2 or 3 and that alone is great solo xp. One warning. If you get greedy here, things can turn real nasty real quick, died several time's before I learned my lesson.<BR>Wonderful xp, chance at cougar earring and if your real ambitious solo Stormfeather at lvl 35. Takes about 20 minutes of med kiting but the drop is worth it... <BR> <BR>rtfm<BR>Registered User<BR>(5/16/01 9:07:36 am)<BR>Reply | Edit  Re: How do you hunt snow cougars in Iceclad?<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> Um, no zone?<BR><BR>What about that big dragon thingy?<BR><BR>I know it's a long way, but it is there. <BR> <BR>oldfool<BR>Registered User<BR>(5/16/01 10:18:36 am)<BR>Reply  cougars<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> I started soloing the kittens at level 30. First few levels I did this:<BR>-pull with combust, pull it to the igloos, no wanderers there<BR>-snare<BR>-root<BR>-DOT (NO immolate)<BR>-meditate while it rots<BR>-repeat whatever breaks<BR><BR>At level 33 I could just DD kite them with combust. Hardly any resists and I would have at least 20m left after the kite (wis around 180).<BR><BR>At level 34 I started multikiting them, not too hard, had to do a little medkiting if I got a few resists, but was pretty safe after all. When you multikite, make sure you don't get the kittens too close to other PC's. Somehow they don't like to play with four cats <IMG SRC="/boards/images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <BR>A good kitearea is along the shore, start at the dock and go south.<BR><BR>When you think you might get in trouble, run to other island and gate out to clear agro. Make sure you know when you're in trouble tho, it really isn't nice to be 00m and having to medkite to be able to gate <IMG SRC="/boards/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <BR> <BR>Saere Silverwolf  <BR>Registered User<BR>(5/16/01 3:10:51 pm)<BR>Reply  Re: How do you hunt snow cougars in Iceclad?<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> If you get into trouble, run. When you travel a short distance away they will get tired of chasing you and go back to the main island. However, if you do this don't be in wolf form because you are KoS to the gnolls there. Just camp to get rid of aggro and then go back. <BR><BR>Sae <BR> <BR>Queyla<BR>Registered User<BR>(5/17/01 5:43:06 am)<BR>Reply  Re: How do you hunt snow cougars in Iceclad?<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> I did this at the igloos from 34 - 38... it was great and easy for me.<BR><BR>I had 187 wis + 50 mana, so you should have no problem.<BR><BR>Although it was signifigantly easier once I dinged level 35.<BR><BR>Just round up a quad, run em back to shore, then nuke nuke nuke. Yes at 34 there are resists, so you may have to med kite a bit.<BR><BR>On the aggro thing, I was bound in the gnoll camp near the TOFS, and I would jsut gate out and camp to clear aggro.<BR><BR>Saved me all the trouble of gating, then porting, then running ALL THE WAY back to the igloos.<BR><BR>Queyla <BR> <BR>vermis mysteriis  <BR>Registered User<BR>(5/20/01 3:22:41 am)<BR>Reply <BR>  ...<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> Bump to get FranticT off the first page =] <BR>Vermis Mysteriis demon of call of cathulu. <BR>Fifty Fifth Preserver of prexus. <BR>Proud member of Domus Divinae.<BR> <BR>Logan667<BR>Registered User<BR>(5/21/01 10:49:00 am)<BR>Reply  Re: ...<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> Have you tried snare, dot, animal fear, boom?<BR><BR>(Yes, I hunted cougars for LOTS of levels - if you animal fear near the docks they always go for the docks - make sure to ensnare them so they don't jump off the end of the docks. My strategy may not work for you as I am playing a nec and druid at the same time. What a great combo. Of course, the druid mainly serves as support for the nec due to mana downtime of the druid...) <BR> <BR>NilweanTP<BR>Registered User<BR>(5/23/01 12:27:09 pm)<BR>Reply  Re: How do you hunt snow cougars in Iceclad?<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> Quad or fear kite near the tower, if you get in trouble zone in.<BR><BR><BR><BR> <BR>God Have Mercy<BR>Registered User<BR>(5/29/01 11:43:53 am)<BR>Reply  Re: How do you hunt snow cougars in Iceclad?<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> I've never been to velious (just got it) I'm level 34 right now, going to port to iceclad soon, where are these igloos? <BR> <BR>Queyla Windrider<BR>Registered User<BR>(5/29/01 12:11:09 pm)<BR>Reply  Re: How do you hunt snow cougars in Iceclad?<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> Geeze, if I were you I'd just take the boat the first time <IMG SRC="/boards/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> Igloos are to the left off of the dock.<BR><BR>Go Grab yourself a map from EQ Atlas.<BR><BR><!-- BBCode auto-link start --><a href="http://www.eqatlas.com" target="_blank">www.eqatlas.com</a><!-- BBCode auto-link end --><BR><BR>Queyla <BR> <BR>Logan667<BR>Registered User<BR>(5/31/01 11:46:29 am)<BR>Reply  Re: How do you hunt snow cougars in Iceclad?<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> Oh - to answer your questions:<BR><BR>1) Resists: Are snow cougars more magic resistant than the creatures of the old world? <BR><BR>>>>No.<BR><BR>Are they especially resistant to fire based spells like Immolate and Combust? What spells should I use against them, what spells should I NOT use against them.<BR><BR>>>>Fire works fine.<BR><BR>2) Escape: Can you save yourself by zoning out of Iceclad? <BR><BR>>>>No, not anywhere close enough to matter if you are doing cougars.<BR><BR>I only was on the first island, with the gnomish pirate wannabees in the igloos. Obviously there is no zone border there, and I was afraid to run through the whole unknown zone to escape at the other end. Are there any "guards" that could eliminate the cougars for you if something goes wrong? Will the gnomes kill the cougars if you pull them there?<BR><BR>>>>No and no. You are going to have to be totally self reliant.<BR><BR>3) Strategy: I tried Ensnare, Root, double DoT and didn't get very far with that strategy. Too many resists, to many adds. <BR><BR>>>>Ever hunt wisps on Erud Crossing? The same strategy applies: You must take them off of their wandering path. They have static wandering paths. If you are getting adds, that means you are a) not pulling with harmony or b) fighting them on their paths.<BR><BR>Would nuking be better than DoTing here? <BR><BR>>>>Shrug.<BR><BR>Should I use Terrorize Animal, or is that just inviting a horde of cats after me? <BR><BR>>>>Depends on how well you learn the pathing. As I am playing a necro (as well as a druid, yes at the same time) I have learned more about their pathing than I care to admit. Unless you find where they poorly programmed the pathing, it is asking for more cougars.<BR><BR>Would charming a cougar and letting him fight against another one help? <BR><BR>>>>I never had good luck with charm as a druid.<BR><BR>I don't think I have enough mana to quadkite them yet.<BR><BR>>>>With what you said about getting too many resists, neither do I. <BR><BR>Here is a tactic I was messing about with the other night that may (or may not) be helpful.<BR><BR>Snare<BR>Root<BR>Dot<BR>Dot<BR>Fear<BR>(sit)<BR><BR>If root breaks, the animal will begin to go away from you. <BR><BR>Fear<BR>Root<BR><BR>Reapply dots as needed.<BR><BR>You will have to discover whether or not this is mana efficient for you.<BR><BR>Just wanted to give some ideas.<BR><BR>Logan  <BR></FONT><BR></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR="#f7f5e6"><TD nowrap align="left">&nbsp;</TD><TD><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp<a href="/boards/bb_profile.php?mode=view&user=221"><img src="/boards/images/profile.gif" border=0 alt="View Profile of Flaim"></a>
