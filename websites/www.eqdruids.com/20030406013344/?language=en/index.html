        this thought, I would like to have someone actually verify this.&nbsp; I

        - Changed Strength of the Diaku to a single target strength and

        - Changed Talisman of the Diaku to a group strength and dexterity buff.
        <br>

        - Purify Soul now removes a larger number of poison, disease and curse 
        counters. <br>
        - Changed Frenzy of Spirit to stack better with haste spells. <br>
        <br>
        ** Quests ** <br>

        either if one of them is already around. <br>

        <br>
        - Added a command to allow you to toggle your target between your two 
        last targets (unlike Tab which toggles between your character and your 
        last target). To set the key that activates this feature, just open your 
        options window and select the Keyboard Tab. If you select all 
        categories, the entry will be the last one on the list, called Toggle 
        last two targets. This was actually added with our last patch. <br>
        <br>
        ** NPCs ** <br>
        <br>

        - Shin Master Grubbus in Gukta will now be more selective about who he 
        allows to do tasks for him, and he'll be speaking directly to folks 
        (using /tell). His chatty nature was raising the volume in Gukta to 
        levels that were considered unacceptable. He will also be a bit clearer 
        about what he wants. <br>
        - Shar Vahl guards will now defend their city against Loda Kai poachers.

        - Porra, one of the Enchanter spell vendors in Felwithe, will no longer 
        spawn inside of a wall. This was hurting her business. <br>
        - Hutyn L`Lozz will now appear in his place of business and be less 
        likely to leave to go sightseeing in Neriak. <br>
        - Cleet Miller Jr. will now emote &quot;Grumbles and looks up at you&quot; instead 
        of saying it. <br>
        - The Goblins in Solusek's Eye are no longer wearing cloth armor. <br>
        - Junth McMannus will now be properly affected by movement reducing 
        spells. <br>

        well as Sage Xelrin, Sulgar, Warlord Gligoth, Bryce McFadden, Serna 
        Tasknon, Welno Tanlonikan, Lorekeeper_Einar and Master of Elements. <br>
        - These NPCs will now be asking for the correct items for their quests: 
        Gazoon Noihzog, Liteema Agner and Bolli Hillfoot. <br>
        - Kodiaks in the Rathe Mountains should be friendlier to Druids and 
        Rangers. <br>
        - Undead Frogloks and Skeletons in Sebilis no longer have an extreme 
        dislike for each other. <br>
        - Groflah Steadirt's corpse will no longer disappear when he is killed. 
        However, he is also no longer a merchant. <br>
        - Moved the Planar Projection for Rallos Zek so it can't be interfered 
        with by the zone exit. <br>
        - Corrected the spawn times for the Minotaur Hero. <br>
        - Half elven female bandits will now give experience, leave corpses and 
        be aided by other bandits. <br>
        - A Coerced Iiksar will now be known as A Coerced Iksar. <br>
        - Merchant Nora in Felwithe will once again sell her jewelry supplies.
        <br>

        <br>
        - Jusean will now give the proper quest reward when given the proper 
        item(s). <br>
        - Plaguebone Thieves no longer flee. <br>

        for access to the lower parts of the Crypt of Decay. <br>
        - Added new sounds to Shadowhaven. <br>
        - <b>Removed safe spots in Katta, Solusek's Eye, High Keep, Echo

        Valor, Plane of Torment and Plane of Water. </b><br>

        - Removed a box out in the middle of Skyfire that turned when clicked 
        but had no real purpose. <br>
        - Fixed a place in Burning Woods and the Plane of Knowledge where NPCs 
        would get stuck while wandering around. <br>
        - Also fixed a place in Erud's Crossing where sharks were getting stuck.

        from above. <br>
        - Moved the Koada'Dal Forge so that it does not extend into the hallway 
        on the second floor of the building. <br>
        - The teleporter from the Great Divide to the Plane of Knowledge will 
        now work during Coldain Ring War. <br>
        - The exit from the Plane of Justice to the Plane of Tranquility has 
        been moved to place characters next to the Plane of Justice entrance.
        <br>

        capability to research some of these advanced Druid spells does exist!&nbsp; 
        It brings me great pleasure to be able to share this with my 
        contemporaries who follow this discipline, as their work is so closely 
        related to mine.&nbsp; Below are the results of my study. If should be
