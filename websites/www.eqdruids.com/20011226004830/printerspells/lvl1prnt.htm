  Add 3 AC and 11 HP</b></li>
</ul>
<p>This is an excellent buff spell. It improves slightly as your skill
increases. Its effect is to add about 3 to your overall Armor Class, and 10 + (1/your
level) hps to your hit point total. A must have spell. It is eventually replaced
by Skin Like Rock.&nbsp; Always keep this up to buff yourself and your party
with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <li><b>Mana Cost 7</b></li>
  <li><b>Effect:&nbsp; Direct Damage (DD) for between 3-5
    damage</b></li>
</ul>
<p>A minor burn spell. It costs 7 mana to cast and only does 3-5 damage, but
it’s similar to the other classes first burn spell. Comes in as a useful
supplement to your melee attack. You have to time it so you begin casting
immediately after the monster attacks to improve your chance of not being
interrupted. A must have spell at this level.&nbsp; This spell is great as a
lure spell. It doesn't do much damage but it sure beats chasing down things.</p>

Healing:</font></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>

  <li><b>Mana Cost 10</b></font>&nbsp;</li>
<li><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica"><b>Effect:&nbsp;
  Heal 10 hitpoints</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Again, this spell is pretty much the same as other 1<sup>st</sup> rank
healing spells. It does a fine job for the first five levels or so, but after
that it becomes less useful to heal people in combat, because the monsters can
dish out so much more damage than this spell can heal. Unfortunately Druids
don’t get anything better until 9<sup>th</sup> level. Its still useful from 5<sup>th</sup>-8<sup>th</sup>
as an after combat heal spell, although you have to cast it many many times.
Once you get Light Healing you won’t use this spell much. This spell heals 10
pts of dmg.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Evocation</b></li>
  <li><b>Mana Cost 10</b></font>&nbsp;</li>
<li><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica"><b>Effect:&nbsp;
  Reduces AC of mob by 4 (-4 AC) and for 10 rounds will damage mob at one hp per
  round (DOT and Debuff)</b></li>
</ul>
<p>A very minor DOT (Damage Over Time) spell. It doesn't do much damage (10
points), but its most beneficial effect is to reduce the AC of the target by a
few points (-4), which can make a difference at the lower levels. It requires a
fire beetle eye to cast, but the fire beetle eye is NOT consumed after casting.
It is best to use it as an &quot;opener&quot; to draw the monster to you, so
it's AC has been lowered before you engage it in melee. Another benefit of this
spell is the target is prevented from regenerating hps during battle in case you
happen to miss a lot (For low level mobs under 10). In addition to this, the
lower a target's ac the higher chance you have of hitting for max dmg more
often.</p>
<p>A quirk of this spell is, that for Woodelf druids it is almost unusable due
to the fact that nothing drops fire beetle eyes anywhere near Greater
Faydark.&nbsp; This has been addressed to Verant, but no changes have been made
at this time.</p>

<p><b><a name="Snare:"><font size="4" face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">Snare:</font></a><font size="4" face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Alteration</b></li>
  <li><b>Mana Cost 15</b></li>
  <li><b>Effect:&nbsp; Lowers movement rate of mob.&nbsp;
    Movement is reduced 41% at level 1, and increases to 55% at level 15</b></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a very good spell. . In effect it halves the speed of an adversary
and it only costs 15 mana. Once the monster is ensnared you do the &quot;Run,
turn and burn&quot; routine until it is dead or injured enough to take out with
melee. This spell is also an excellent &quot;finisher&quot; against monsters
that have a tendency to run when they get low on hit points. Rather than use an
expensive burn spell to kill them, cast snare. Once the monster is wounded it
slows down to a creeping pace, and once it is damaged to 1/4 health it stops
moving altogether. A beneficial side effect of this is even though the monster
is no longer moving it is still in &quot;flee&quot; mode and will not attack
you. You can finish it off with melee attacks at your leisure.&nbsp; Always have
this ready - costs little and should be a prime job of the druid in groups and
solo.&nbsp; Snare monsters BEFORE they start to run.</p>
<p>This is a must have spell in your spell book.</p>

  <li><b>Abjuration</b></li>
  <li><b>Mana Cost 20</b></li>
  <li><b>Effect:&nbsp; Adds to your Resist Fire (up to
    +20)</b></li>
</ul>
<p>This is another long lasting buff spell, so feel free to cast it during your
&quot;buff&quot; phase prior to going adventuring. It only costs 20 mana so its
pretty reasonable for as long as it lasts. This spell is very hand for going up
against casters that attack with fire.&nbsp; It will not make you safe against
fire, but will reduce the amount of damage you will take from an attack.</p>

<p><b><a name="Lull Animal:"><font size="4" face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">Lull

<ul>
  <li><b>Alteration</b></li>
  <li><b>Mana Cost 10</b></li>
  <li><b>Effect:&nbsp; Lowers Animal Frenzy and Reaction</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Lull Animal does NOT work in combat. It is essential to cast it BEFORE
combat, which reduces its effectiveness because you have to guess which animals
are going to potentially gang up on you before you start combat.&nbsp;</p>

  <li><b>Mana Cost 10</b></li>
  <li><b>Effect:&nbsp; Fears the animal, so it will run
    away</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Same mana cost as Lull Animal and you can cast it in combat. It makes the
rats run away, which is good. I kept this one memorized instead of Lull Animal.&nbsp;
Remember they come back eventually and attack.</p>

  <li><b>Mana Cost 5</b></li>
  <li><b>Effect:&nbsp; Points your body in the direction
    of nearest animal, and targets that animal.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>When cast it spins your body around and points you in the direction of the
nearest animal, and targets that animal as well. Unfortunately its not like
tracking where you get to pick from a list of potential targets, it
automatically selects the nearest one. </p>

<p>This spell creates a globe of light that you can place in an inventory slot.
It works well if you do not have Infravision.&nbsp; Night Only casting</p>
