<p>Trelemyst's Guide to Harmony<br>
<br>
Harmony is basically an area effect lull spell which works by decreasing the<br>
radius of the NPCs aggro range.&nbsp; In short, if you harmony a group of NPCs<br>
and then attack one, the rest will not attack when they otherwise would<br>
have.&nbsp; It is very handy in that it allows you to pull NPCs in a controlled<br>
fashion (one or two at a time), allowing you or your group to handle camps<br>
that might have otherwise overwhelmed you at the first pull.&nbsp; It is one of<br>
the spells that make druids such effective solo artists in the game, and<br>
nice for group work at tough camps.&nbsp; There are a few surprises that people<br>
may encounter based on spell mechanics, but if you are aware of how the<br>
spell works you will find that the &quot;resistances&quot; other people talk
about<br>
don't really happen (NOTE - I have not tested this on reds, only greens,<br>
blues, whites, and yellows).&nbsp; Following are some hints based on the various<br>
aspects of the spell.<br>
<br>
Visual Effects:&nbsp; There is a nice little effect, a white pulsating light
that<br>
radiates out from the waist of the affected NPCs.&nbsp;<br>
Hints:<br>
&nbsp;- It is NOT VISIBLE from the outer reaches of the spells range; in other<br>
words, if you are standing as far away as you can to cast the spell, you<br>
WILL NOT see the effect, and you won't know for sure which ones have been<br>
harmonied.<br>
&nbsp;- Conversely, if you don't see the effect, it doesn't mean the NPC is not<br>
harmonied.&nbsp; Unless you get the &quot;target out of range&quot; message, you
can assume<br>
the target NPC is indeed harmonied.<br>
&nbsp;- If the NPCs are not attack on sight to you, stand near to them when you<br>
cast, so you can see which ones you've nailed.&nbsp; The spell is NOT considered<br>
a hostile act by NPCs, so they will not attack you even if the spell didn't<br>
take hold.<br>
<br>
Duration:&nbsp; (Tested by casting on self)&nbsp; A bit over a minute.&nbsp; Not
sure if it<br>
increases with levels.&nbsp;<br>
Hints:<br>
&nbsp;- You have a comfortable window in which you can get off about 3 casts of<br>
harmony before you ought to get down to business.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;- Alternatively, if you only have to cast it once, you can get 45 seconds<br>
of meditation time for that last little bit of mana.<br>
&nbsp;- When you pull your prey, PULL your prey.&nbsp; In other words, drag it
back<br>
well away from the rest of the camp.&nbsp; I've seen people harmony a camp, then<br>
fight the NPC too close to the rest.&nbsp; Harmony wears off, and now they've
got<br>
a full camp thumping their foolish little heads.<br>
<br>
Range: Seems to be about 30 or 40 yards.&nbsp;<br>
Hint:<br>
&nbsp;- In order to be sure you're getting everything you think you're getting,<br>
target the Middle NPC.<br>
&nbsp;- You will NOT see the visual effect at the max range.<br>
<br>
Spell Radius: Seems to be about 5-8 yards.&nbsp;<br>
Hints:<br>
&nbsp;- If you're not sure, or you can't see the effect, etc, be safe and cast
it<br>
on multiple NPCs rather than trust the area effect.&nbsp; One of the spell<br>
failures is when people overestimate the radius of the area effect.<br>
&nbsp;- If it's something that does not attack you on sight (aviaks, for<br>
instance), you can go stand right up with them, harmony one towards the<br>
middle, and see if there are any you missed by directly observing the visual<br>
effect up close.<br>
<br>
Aggro Radius:&nbsp; Harmony does ~not~ decrease the aggro radius to zero.&nbsp;
In my<br>
testing, it seems to be about one arm-length.&nbsp; In other words, if 2 NPCs
are<br>
standing close enough to each other so that one could touch the other with<br>
an outstretched arm, they are STILL within each other's aggro radius after<br>
reduction by harmony.&nbsp; In short, if they're standing right next to each<br>
other, you can't pull one without pulling the other.<br>
Hints:<br>
&nbsp;- If two NPCs are standing right next to each other, you won't be able to<br>
pull them individually.&nbsp; You cast harmony, see the spell effect on both<br>
NPCs, pull one...and they both come running at you.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; The spell
hasn't<br>
decreased the aggro radius enough so they don't overlap.&nbsp; You ~can~ pull<br>
other NPCs away from these two singly, but those two are a pair.&nbsp; How to<br>
deal with a pair of high blues left as an exercise to the reader; there are<br>
at least two good techniques.<br>
<br>
The Whim of the Fates:&nbsp; The spell obviously doesn't work on things that<br>
spawn or wander through after you've cast it.<br>
Hints:<br>
&nbsp;- As mentioned above, PULL when you pull, well back from the camp, and
have<br>
a relatively safe fighting spot picked out before you cast.<br>
&nbsp;- You remembered to keep spirit of the wolf freshened up, right?&nbsp; And
snare<br>
your prey early in the battle, right?&nbsp; Right?<br>
<br>
Final hints:<br>
&nbsp;- If you're in a group, let them know how the basics of how the spell<br>
works, most importantly to pull the prey back to a safe fighting are.<br>
&nbsp;- Beware of NPC casters who may be able to Cancel Magic on their buddies<br>
&nbsp;- It won't work if they're already aggro on your little druid butt, e.g.<br>
chasing or attacking you.<br>
