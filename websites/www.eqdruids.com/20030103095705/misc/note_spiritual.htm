  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Well

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">I 
  wanted to personally say a few words to all the visitors here, and tell you 
  what your support has meant to me.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">For 
  those that were not aware, this has been a very rough year for me.&nbsp; I lost a 
  friend to a suicide, marriage went south, had to have a fairly major surgery, 
  found out I have a chronic illness, and a few other things.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">What 
  I don’t think enough folks realize, is that running EQDruids for all of you 
  helped me through those times.&nbsp; Knowing that we were doing something that 
  people appreciated, and found important gave me a reason to keep moving along, 
  instead of wallowing.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
  Letters of support like:</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">“Hi there. My 
  main is currently a 19 Human Druid (don’t laugh, i like humans) and wanted to 
  say that your site is the greatest. I’ve gone to other sites that are basic on 
  classes, and none match yours. The best part of eqdruids, in my opinion, is 
  the spell listings. You give us where to get them, what they do, etc. I visit 
  the site al least once a day. Keep up the good work man, its great.”</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">“</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">Thank 
  you for all the hard work on your website.&nbsp; It has helped me tremendously.&nbsp; I 
  am a first time Everquest player, and decided to play a Halfling Druid.&nbsp; While 
  playing the other night, another druid came up to me and gave me a few items.&nbsp; 
  I started to ask her some questions, and while answering them, she gave me the 
  web address for eqdruids.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;Am I ever glad 
  she did!&nbsp; The site is perfect for me.&nbsp; I have learned all about kiting for 
  when I get the ability, which spells are more for show and which are 
  functional, and good areas and tricks for leveling.&nbsp; I also really benefited 
  from that piece about sharpening the sword.&nbsp; Now that my skills are maxed for 
  the level, I really do notice a difference in fizzles, which saves my mana and 
  health.”</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">“I'm usually too 
  lazy to write something like this but in this case I felt I needed to do it.&nbsp; 
  Your web site is the BEST source for Druids, much more Everquest, that I have 
  ever come across.&nbsp; I used to use Everlore, but it is hard to navigate, 
  confusing, and outdated.&nbsp; EQDruids is simple to navigate, to the point, and an 
  invaluable asset.&nbsp; I really appreciate that there is someone out there like 
  you who is dedicated to the site and its upkeep.&nbsp; Thanks again and keep up the 
  GREAT work!!”</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Letters like these 
  helped to make me remember why I run the site (yes, I keep all the letters!).&nbsp; 
  That constant support from people kept me going over a rough year.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">We’ve seen some amazing 
  growth in the site and the forums also!&nbsp; Currently the site sends out 
  approximately 50,000 web pages a day!&nbsp; With between 8-10,000 unique visitors a 
  day!&nbsp; The forums have grown into around 18 thousand views a day!&nbsp; That is over 
  2 million views of web pages and forum pages a month folks!&nbsp; You have no idea 
  how many times I have sat there looking at the numbers and just shook my head 
  in amazement!&nbsp; And it is all due to you, the loyal visitors!&nbsp; The folks that 
  have helped spread the word about the site, and who have contributed time and 
  effort (and even sometimes cash!) towards our continuing operation.&nbsp; EQDruids 
  would not be here without all that support you have all shown!&nbsp; I will never 
  be able to properly show my gratitude for everything that has been done to 
  help out.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">2003 is here.&nbsp; We have 
  big plans!&nbsp; Major upgrades are in the works.&nbsp; I think you will all be very 
  happy with what is coming.&nbsp; Trust me, we here at EQDruids are never happy; we 
  always find ways to improve things!</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">So this thanks goes out 
  to all the visitors of the site.&nbsp; All the wonderful folks that I have met at 
  the various Fan Faires.&nbsp; All the people that take time out of their day, and 
  write us notes!&nbsp; Thank you all!</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The above is all from 
  me, but on top of that, myself, Naila and Tes would like to wish you all a 
  wonderful New Year, and hope that you all have an incredible 2003!!</span></p>
