  &nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2">I didn't find a tactic description using
  root and dot though.&nbsp; I found it fairly efficient for taking down Broon
  and crag spiders at 24th and higher level.&nbsp; I'll put a tactic description
  here in case you'd like to include it.</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">Since DOTs do less damage when the creature is
  moving kiting with DOTs has become much less mana efficient, almost exactly as
  mana efficient as direct damage kiting.&nbsp; Another option to solo those
  hard hitting creatures you don't want to close to combat with is to use root
  and dot as a tactic.&nbsp; I've found it to work well in East Karana on Broon
  and crag spiders.&nbsp; Broon hits hard enough that I'd rather not close to
  combat with him for long, and the spider poison is good to avoid too, doing
  perhaps 200 points over one minute.&nbsp; Here's the root and dot tactic as I
  use it.</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">I use Ensnaring Roots and Creeping Crud for this
  tactic.&nbsp;&nbsp; We get them both at 24th level, so this tactic only
  becomes effective at that level.&nbsp; I get close to the creature, and start
  with root.&nbsp; If the first root holds I put the dot on him and sit and
  meditate.&nbsp; If the root holds a whole minute I recast the dot right at the
  end of the minute.&nbsp; Our swarm line dots have 13 6 second ticks of damage
  so the&nbsp;best time&nbsp;to reapply&nbsp;the dot is at one minute seven
  seconds after the first started.&nbsp; When I hear him coming I stand up and
  start the root again, casting again until it holds.&nbsp; Then I back up out
  of combat range and sit and med again.&nbsp; I stand up to recast the dot when
  necessary.</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">To do this perfectly keep track of two times, time
  since the dot was applied and time since the root was applied.&nbsp; Stand up
  at the one minute mark of each to be ready when you need to recast.&nbsp; An
  important&nbsp;buff during this tactic especially in East Karana is staying in
  wolf form because otherwise there are plenty of lions that will still try to
  take advantage of a sitting person there.</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">The real efficiency from this tactic is getting
  the med time in&nbsp;DURING the combat.&nbsp; The
  Rank 2 spell Grasping Roots doesn't last long enough for this tactic to be
  effective because between resists and it possibly breaking every 10 seconds it
  doesn't allow time to med.&nbsp; Ensnaring Roots does 35 points of damage for
  the 60 mana, but the real damage comes from the full damage DOT Creeping Crud,
  198 damage for 100 mana.&nbsp; Ensnaring Roots lasts 0, 30, 60, 90, or 120
  seconds.&nbsp; If the spells is resisted or the Root damage breaks the root
  immediately after it takes hold the spell lasts 0 seconds.&nbsp; Otherwise the
  creature&nbsp;has about a 25% chance to break free with each additional resist
  roll every 30 seconds.</font>
