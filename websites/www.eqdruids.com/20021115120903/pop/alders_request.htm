  <font face="Arial">This is a raid level quest for entry to the Crypt of Decay 
  (Ruins of Lxanvom). <br>
  <br>
  Talk to Alder Fuirstel in the Plane of Tranquility, he will ask for help 
  saving his brother from a disease which is killing him. They were both 
  followers of Bertoxxulous, but have changed their ways.<br>
  <br>
  Say, &quot;What Ward&quot; to Alder. This will flag your character so that you may open 
  the gates of the Castle inside the Plane of Disease.<br>
  <br>
  Inside the castle in the plane of Disease, you will need to kill Gryme the 
  Crypt Guardian to receive a key to the Crypt he guards. He is relatively easy 
  and can be dropped with 2 groups.<br>
  <br>
  The passageway is guarded by Armin the Spider Guardian, who is a little harder 
  than Gryme. Aramin also drops loot. <br>
  <br>
  In the bottom of the Castle, is Grummus. He hits for about 1100, and has two 
  very nasty Area Effect attacks. <br>
  <br>
  Ensure that your raid is set up as a raid, and kill Grummus. Doing so will 
  spawn &quot;A Planar Projection&quot; which the people in the raid may then hail to 
  receive another character flag.<br>
  <br>
  You may proceed from there straight on to the Ruins of Lxanvom, or head out to 
  talk to Alder again. He will sense your victory and ask you to go see his 
  brother &quot;Elder Fuirstel&quot;. <br>
  <br>
  Lying on his deathbed, Elder Fuirstel will become cleansed by your presence, 
  and ask you to continue on in the Crypt of Decay and slay Bertoxxulous for him</font></b></p>
