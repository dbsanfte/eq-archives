<p><font size="2">You will popup at the red '1', start running as the green
lines indicates, keep close to the walls on the house where you spawned not to aggravated
mobs in house 3. Keep as high up on the zone wall as you possible can. When you
get to approx point B1, stay for a short while and look around to make sure that
you haven't aggravated anything. Continue to B2, same as B1 here, a quick look
around to make sure nothing is aggravated. Then proceed to B3 and wait here, as
high up on the wall as possible (there should be several other waiting here).</font></p>
<p><font size="2">If you happen to catch a mob on the way, just stay and die, DON'T
try to get help or anything, if you can, try to camp (don't quit /q, CAMP). The
rest of the raid will get you and resurrect you. If you do aggravate a mob make
sure you die ON the break-in path. If you have the time, make a small note on OOC
to let the rest of the raid know that you die (/ooc got aggro, waiting for
death, trying to camp)</font></p>
<p><font size="2">B3 is your final destination, congratulations. Camp out and
hit the chat room.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">After this, just follow instructions from the organizer... to
be able to do this, shut everything off your chat-filter except says, tells,
guildsay, ooc and shout... you NEED to know what's going on, not if you hit the
mob for 5 or 20 damage...</font></p>

</div>
<p align="left"><strong>Revultant Rat - </strong>Warrior - They look like a
giant diseased rat and have low magic resist, but proc Deadly Poison. Only drop
is a Ranger Whip. They do not see rogues, but may or may not see normal invis
(some do, some don't). They have a small aggro range.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Abhorrent</strong> - Rogue - They look like gargoyles
and have very low magic resist, but love to backstab, so make sure the puller is
careful pulling them. They drop rogue gear. They do not see rogues or normal
invisible. They have a small aggro range.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Cleric of Innoruuk</strong> - Cleric - They look like a
Dark Elf guard. They have high magic resist, so harder to mez, and they love to
complete heal. They also buff the mobs they pass with cleric buffs. Keep them
stunned (bash/ slam) while fighting and kill them fast. They drop cleric gear.
They do not see rogues or even normal invisible. They have a normal aggro range.</p>
<p><strong>Forsaken Revanant, Male</strong> - undead Magician - They look like
male vampires and have normal magic resistance. They also cast a mean damage
shield and nasty AE direct damage. Undead magic does work. They drop mage gear.
They do not see rogues, but do see normal invis. They have normal aggro range.</p>
<p><strong>Forsaken Revanant, Female</strong> - undead Enchanter - They look
like female vampires and have high magic resistance, but they do not cast charm.
They do cast a damage shield, though. Undead magic works. They drop Enchanter
gear. They do not see rogues but do see normal invis. They have normal aggro
range.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Spite Golem - </strong>Shaman - They look like a rock
golem. They have insane magic resist (although poison, disease, and the wizard
Lure spells will usually stick). This is the most important target most times.
If you get 2, one warrior, usually the backup assist, will keep second one busy
while the group kills number 1. It is possible to kill several, but very, very
tough, so be careful. They love to cast SoW and other Alacrity on everything
close to them. They drop shaman armor including a shield, and a druid shield.
They do not see a rogue, but see everything else. They have a large aggro range.</p>
<p><strong>Ire Ghast - </strong>undead Shadow Knight - They look like a ghoul
and have low magic resist, so easy to mez, but love to HarmTouch, and do it a
lot. Undead magic works on them. They drop some Paladin weapons (mace and sword)
and a shield, and can also drop the druid shield, though extremely rare. They do
not see rogues, but do see normal player invisible (although invis to undead
would work). They have a small aggro range.</p>
<p><strong>Scorn Banshee</strong> - undead Warrior - They look like a female
zombie and have low magic resist, but proc Strong Disease and hit a ton. But
undead magic works. They drop Bard gear. They DO see rogues and all invis,
including invis to undead, regardless of what con says. *** BE CAREFUL *** They
do have a small aggro range, though.</p>
<p><strong>Loathing Lich</strong> - undead Wizard - They look like a spectre and
have very low magic resist but more hp than most mobs in Hate, plus are undead
so undead magic works well, so usually easy kills. But they will cast the wizard
damage shield (the annoying 2 damage spam shield). They drop a Necromancer rod.
They DO see a rogue as well as anything else. *** BE CAREFUL *** They have a
small self-aggro range, but will pass chain-aggro other mobs a very large range.</p>
<p><strong>Ashenbone Drake</strong> - Necromancer - Looks like a skeletal dragon
or a small DracoLiche from Fear. They have high magic resist and love to cast
Fear, plus they hit like a tank. They drop a tank axe or a Shadow Knight shield
or weapon. They do not see rogues, but do see normal invis. They have an insane
aggro range and have been known to aggro stuff across the zone. Be extremely
careful on this one's aggro.</p>
<p><strong>Kiraikuei</strong> - undead Monk - They look like a mummy and have
low magic resist. They will proc Strong Disease. They are undead, so undead
magic works well on them. They drop warrior gear and a monk Shuriken. They do
not see rogues, but do see normal invis, though invis to undead would work. They
have a very large aggro range, but a small pass-on range, so they will aggro
with anything close, but not aggro the mobs around them... usually.</p>
<p><strong>Haunted Chest</strong> - Warrior - They look like a bog box with
teeth. They will proc a Nullify Magic, so they will strip your buffs. They can
drop any armor item from the Planes of Fear, and possibly from Hate. They do not
see a rogue, but do see others. They have an extremely small aggro range and are
very slow. When pulling, the puller has to stay close, or the box will forget
and go home. They even aggro other mobs at a very short range. Boxes spawn only
in fixed locations. They are not on any other spawn table.</p>
<p><strong>Maestro of Rancor</strong> - Bard - Looks like Lord Mistmoore, but
since he hasn't been seen in a long time, I guess Mistmoore looks like Maestro.
He is a Bard, but since NPCs do not use BardSong, you could say he's a warrior.
He hits a TON and has an ae lifetap on everything in melee range. And if he has
dual weapons, he hits extremely fast. He normally drops 2 items, mostly Bard
stuff, though a few monk items and a nice dropable shield. He sees rogues and
all normal invis, but his back is usually to the door so no problem. He is the
lesser boss of Hate.</p>
<p><strong>Innoruuk</strong> - god - He looks like Innoruuk, no other way to say
it. He does a DeathTouch every 30 seconds or so of the fight and loves to cast
gravity flux. He has a long list of drops, and most of it nice. He sees rogues
and will DeathTouch you in a heart-beat.</p>
