You can download EQ Companion from the <a target="_self" href="Downloads.html">
downloads-page</a>. Since EQ Companion is written in Visual Basic, it requires 
some Visual Basic run-time libraries to run. If you have Visual Basic 6 
installed on your computer, all you need is the approximately 200kb executable 
only ZIP file. If you do not have VB 6 or if you are not sure, you should 
download the full installer which is approximately 3mb. There are separate 
installer programs for different versions of Windows so if you decide to 
download the full installer, make sure you pick the one for your windows 
version. The executable-only ZIP files work with all Windows versions.<p>There 
are 2 ways of using EQ Companion, you can either use it off-line to parse your 
old log files or you can use it on-line to parse the live EverQuest log file as 
you are playing EverQuest. If you have 2 networked computers, you can install EQ 
Companion on your second computer and use the first to play EverQuest with.</p>
<p><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Running the installer:</font></b></p>
<p>The installer file is a ZIP file. You should have WinZip on your computer to 
un-pack the file. You can download WinZip for free from <a href="http://www.winzip.com">
http://www.winzip.com</a>. With WinZip installed on your computer, you can just 
double-click on the EQ Companion installer file and WinZip opens it up. You 
can use WinZip's 'Install' button to start the installation.</p>
<p>The only thing you are asked for is in which directory you want to install EQ 
Companion in. The default directory should work just fine. Once EQ Companion is 
installed, you should be able to find it from your start menu.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><b>Downloading the executable-only ZIP file:</b></font></p>
<p>Typically the installer program does not install the latest version. The
<a target="_self" href="Downloads.html">downloads-page</a> has link for the latest 
version of EQ Companion. This file is typically only about 200kb in size. Once 
you download it and open it in WinZIP, you should extract is on top of your old 
version of EQ Companion.</td>

<font color="#FF0000" size="4"><b>Finding your log file:</b></font><p>EQ Companion works by reading a log file that EverQuest writes into. This log 
file resides in the same directory where you have installed EverQuest into. The 
file name for the log file looks like 'eqlog_&lt;playername&gt;_&lt;servernumber&gt;.txt' 
where '&lt;playername&gt;' is your character's name and '&lt;servernumber&gt;' is a 2-digit 
number that identifies the EverQuest server you play on.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><b>Enabling the log file in EverQuest:</b></font></p>
<p>By default EverQuest 
does not write into this log file. You have to specifically turn the logging on. After 
you have signed on to EverQuest, you can type '/LOG ON' in the command window. 
You can also turn the logging on permanently by opening your EQClient.INI file. 
In its [defaults] section there is an entry which says 'log=false' or 
'log=true'. When this is set to to be 'log=true' the logging will be on 
automatically every time you run EverQuest.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><b>Using EQ Companion on-line or off-line:</b></font><p>There are 2 ways of using EQ Companion. You can either use it off-line to 
parse old log files or you can use it on-line to actively monitor the log file 
as you are playing EverQuest on another computer. Either way all you need to do 
is open your log file and you are good to go.<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4">
<b>Opening the log file:</b></font><p>There are several ways of opening the log 
file. The '<b>Open log file... (Ctrl+O)</b>' menu command is intended for 
opening an old log file. The '<b>Open active log file...</b>' menu command is 
for opening an active log file for real-time parsing.<p>You can specify the 
initial directory the 'File Open' dialog shows separately for both of these 
commands. They are set in the Preferences dialog's '<b>File locations</b>' tab. 
'<b>Open log file... (Ctrl+O)</b>' command opens into the directory that '<b>Log 
Files Directory</b>' entry points to. '<b>Open active log file...</b>' command 
will open into the directory that '<b>EverQuest Directory</b>' points to.<p>If 
you tend to always open the exact same log file, you can use the '<b>Open 
Auto-Load Log File</b>' menu command to open it without having to choose the 
file name using the file-open dialog. First you will have to designate the log 
file in the same preferences-dialog's '<b>File locations</b>' tab under the '<b>Auto-load 
log file</b>' entry.<p>If you are opening an active log file and your log file 
keeps getting just larger and larger, it might take a while for EQ Companion to 
read through it all before it starts actually monitoring new lines. To prevent 
this, you can set the '<b>Skip to end of file when opening active log file</b>' 
flag in the preferences dialog's '<b>File locations</b>' tab.<p>EQ Companion 
will also build a 'Recently opened files' menu structure automatically as you 
open log files. It will always show the last 10 log files you have opened sorted 
so that the last file opened is on top of the list.</td>

</font>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Ignore tells from NPC's</li>: </b>NPC here means any character name that shows a surname in the log file. Player character surnames are not shown in chat messages.
			If you receive a tell from Magnus Eriksson for example, EQC will not show it in the tells-window as it was from an NPC. If you receive
			a tell from NPC without surname, though, EQC would not be able to catch it and it would be listed among other tells to you.</li>
  <li><b>Merge cells</li>: </b>Certain columns have a 'merge cells' feature enabled. What it means is if there are several cells with the same content next to
			each other, they will be shown as a single tall cell with the content printed in the middle of the cell. You can easiest see this in the 
			date columns. If you do not want this feature, you can clear this option and all the cells will be shown separately.</li>
  <li><b>No auto-switch</li>: </b>This is a master switch to turn off all auto-switching. When auto-switching is enabled for a chat channel of the fight-window, if you
			receive a message to that channel, or if fight starts, EQC will automatically switch to that window. If you do not disable it here,
			you can individually choose which channels will use this feature. There is a 'No auto-switch' checkmark at the bottom of each chat channel
			and also in the fights-window.</li>
  <li><b>No auto-switch during fight-mode</li>: </b>This temporarily disables auto-switching to the chat channels if a fight is going on. When the fight ends, auto-switching will work
			as normal</li>
</ul>

<font size="+1" color="#FF0000"><strong>General preferences - When opening old log files:</strong></font><p>

The following flags are stored in the INI file and are useful if you only use EQ Companion to parse fights, for example. Checking these will
make processing the log file faster as EQ Companion does not have to check for chat messages, etc.<p>

There is a similar set of flags in the STATS-window, but those flags are not stored in the INI file. You can use them to enable these settings
on the fly while EQ Companion is already reading through your old log file and parsing it.<br>

<ul>
  <li><b>Ignore chat</li>: </b>Ignores all chat messages when you are opening an old log file (vs. monitoring an active log file)</li>
  <li><b>Ignore loot</li>: </b>Ignores all loot messages (and selling messages) when you are opening an old log file (vs. monitoring an active log file)</li>
  <li><b>Ignore skill increases</li>: </b>Ignores all skill increases when you are opening an old log file (vs. monitoring an active log file)</li>
  <li><b>Ignore all fights</li>: </b>Ignores all fights when you are opening an old log file (vs. monitoring an active log file). This might be useful if you only want to
			check looting or skill increases from previous night for example.</li>
</ul>

<font size="+1" color="#FF0000"><strong>General preferences - Error trapping:</strong></font><p>

You have 4 choices on how EQ Companion should act when it encounters an error. Unless you choose the 'Disable trapping' option, EQ Companion will always
write the error in a file called Debug.log which is in the same directory where the executable is. In that file you will find detailed information on
where the error happened, what the error was and which log line caused the error.
<p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Show all errors</li>: </b>When EQ Companion encounters an error, it will show an error dialog telling what kind of error happened, which procedure it happened in and
			which log line caused the error.</li>
  <li><b>Ignore all</li>: </b>EQ Companion will ignore all errors it encounters.</li>
  <li><b>Show only summary</li>: </b>EQ Companion will only show 1 error dialog after the whole log file is parsed. In that error dialog it will tell how many errors it encountered.
			This option only works when opening an old log file. If you choose this option and you are monitoring an active log file, each error is still
			reported separately.</li>
  <li><b>Disable trapping</li>: </b>This option is only useful for the programmer. It allows the programmer to debug the error instead of getting an error dialog and continuing
			log file parsing. If you choose this option, every error EQ Companion 
  encounters will crash the program.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<font size="+1" color="#FF0000"><strong>General preferences - </strong></font><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Data limits:</font></b></p>
<p>Here you can tweak EQ Companion's memory usage. When EQ Companion parses a 
log file, an internal array is maintained which keeps track of each damage 
message; who hit who for how much damage and using which attack type. It also 
remembers if the hit was a miss and if so, the&nbsp; reason for the miss. It 
also remembers if the hit was a special hit like critical or crippling blow. All 
this information is stored per fight.<br>
<br>
In Visual Basic you have to pre-allocate arrays like this. The '<b>Maximum # 
fights to record</b>' setting tells how many separate fights we allocate memory 
for. The '<b>Maximum hits per fight</b>' setting tells how many damage messages 
are allocated for each fight. By adjusting these values, you can tweak EQ 
Companion to suit your play style.<br>
<br>
If you play a lower level character, typically your fights do not last too long 
and you might set the 'Maximum hits per fight' setting to something like 200 or 
300. On the other hand, if you are a level 60 warrior who attends raids 
regularly and you want to record the whole raid's performance, you might have to 
set the value as high as 50,000 or 60,000. The stats window's '<b>Most 
hits/fight</b>' field shows the maximum number of damage messages in your 
current log file.<br>
<br>
If your log file exceeds the '<b>Maximum # fights to record</b>' setting, EQ 
Companion will show a warning dialog and it will not parse any more fights. If 
your log file exceeds the '<b>Maximum hits per fight</b>' setting, EQ Companion 
will also show a warning dialog but only the current fight's end will be 
ignored.. <br>
<br>
The '<b>Approximate memory usage</b>' field shows approximately how much memory 
your current settings will allocate for EQ Companion. If you change these 
settings, you have to re-start EQ Companion for the new values to take effect.<br>
<br>
The '<b>Maximum chat lines</b>' setting tells the maximum chat lines to keep. It 
will also affect memory usage, but more importantly it will affect parsing 
speed. The fewer lines to keep, the faster EQ Companion seems to work. This 
seems to be because the more lines your chat list has, the longer it seems to 
take for Visual Basic to add lines to the end of the list.<br>
<br>
When the maximum number of chat lines is exceeded, the oldest ones are deleted 
from the top of the list as new ones are added to the end of the list.</p>

<font size="+1" color="#FF0000"><strong>General preferences - </strong></font><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Default user name:</font></b></p>
<p>EQ Companion needs to know your character's name to parse critical hits and 
crippling blows correctly. It has 3 ways of figuring out your character's name:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If the log file has not been renamed, the character's name is taken from 
  there. Both the old file name format 'eqlog_00_playername.txt' and the new 
  file name format 'eqlog_playername_00.txt' are checked against.</li>
  <li>Every once in a while EverQuest saves your character's data to the server. 
  When this happens, there will be 'playername saved.' message in the log file.</li>
  <li>The '<b>Default user name</b>' field here.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are parsing old log files that you have renamed, check #1 will not 
work. If you have also edited your log files and gotten rid of the 'playername 
saved.' lines, check #2 will not work either. In this case you can enter your 
character name here and you will still be able to get criticals and crippling 
blows parsed correctly.<br>
<br>
The reason EQ Companion needs to know your character's name for criticals and 
crippling blows is because all your normal fight messages say 'You hit xxx for 
yyy points of damage.' or 'xxx hits YOU for yyy points of damage'. Because it 
uses 'You', EQ Companion will always know these are your damage messages without 
actually knowing your user name. Critical messages on the other hand say 'playername 
scores a critical hit (280)!&quot;. Since this message shows the player's name and 
never 'you', EQ Companion needs to know what your character's name is in order 
to credit your criticals to you and someone else's criticals to that someone 
else.</p>

Locations</font></b><p>File locations tab has settings which deal directories 
and files.<ul>
  <li><b>EverQuest Directory:</b> This directory is the directory EQ Companion 
  opens up when you use the 'Open active log file' menu command. You should 
  point it to the directory where you have installed EverQuest to. In the future 
  this setting will be also used to find the Notes.txt file and spells_en.txt 
  files.</li>
  <li><b>Log Files Directory: </b>This directory is the directory EQ Companion 
  opens up when you use the 'Open log file' menu command. If you are storing 
  your log files in a separate directory from your EQ directory, you should 
  assign it here.</li>
  <li><b>Map Files Directory: </b>This directory is the directory where you have 
  all your map files on.</li>
  <li><b>Auto-load log file:</b> If you always open the same log file, you can 
  assign it as your 'Auto-load log file'. After that you can just use the 'Open 
  auto-load log file' menu command to open it lot quicker</li>
  <li><b>Filename template: </b>Here you can define a file name template you are 
  using with your archived log files</li>
  <li><b>Default URL: </b>This is the URL the 'Default' button in the HTML 
  window will go to. You can set it to your guild's message board for example if 
  you want to post your HTML tables there.</li>
  <li><b>Skip to end of file when opening active log file:</b> If you enable 
  this option, EQ Companion will not parse your old log lines when you open an 
  active log file. This option is a huge time saver if you let your log file 
  grow without archiving it.</li>

  Here you define what you want to be included in the HTML report.<ul>
    <li><b>All fighters:</b> Include all fighters</li>
    <li><b>Only known friends and foes:</b> Do not include fighters if EQ 
    Companion was not able to figure out if they were friends or foes. The way 
    EQ Companion figures this out is by keeping track on who they hit and who 
    hits them. Who ever hits you is automatically a foe. Who ever hits you is 
    automatically a foe as well. Whoever hits a known foe will be assigned a 
    friend and who ever is hitting a known friend will be automatically assigned 
    a foe.<br>
    Fighters who never hit a known friend or foe and who are never hit by a 
    known friend or foe are left as 'others'. These would typically be people 
    who are just fighting close enough from you so that you can see their damage 
    messages.</li>
    <li><b>Only yourself and main mob:</b> The 'main mob' is determined by how 
    much damage they take. If you are fighting multiple mobs at the same time, 
    which ever mob took most damage will be assigned the 'main mob'. This mob is 
    also listed in the Fights-table.</li>

<p><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">After HTML is generated:</font></b><p>Here 
    you tell what EQ Companion will do after the HTML table is generated.<ul>
      <li><b>Copy HTML to clipboard:</b> The HTML code is copied in the 
      clipboard and you can paste it in a message board thread for example. This 
      option is useful if you want to post your fight tables in a message board 
      thread for example. You should first set the 'Default URL' setting in the 
      'File locations' tab to be the URL for your message board. After that you 
      can just press the 'Default' button at the bottom of the HTML table to go 
      to the message board. Just open the forum where you want to post your 
      table, start a new thread or open an existing thread and paste the HTML 
      code there. If you are using EZBoard, remember to enable HTML.</li>
      <li><b>Switch to browser window:</b> EQ Companion will automatically 
      switch to the HTML window where you can see the table.</li>
      </ul>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">Columns to include:</font></b><p>Here you 
      can define which columns you want to include in the HTML table. The more 
      columns you include, the more cluttered the table will be. You can easily 
      not include Start and End for example as the duration is more important to 
      show. Also to show number of hits, number of misses and hit% is a bit 
      wasteful, by not showing number of misses you are not really missing any 
      information. If you did not have misses on to begin with, you can choose 
      not to show hit% as well as it will be 100% anyways.<p><b>

The statistics page is the page you will see when you launch EQ Companion. It 
shows statistics about the log once it has been read in and parsed. It also 
allows you to change parsing settings on the fly when the log file is being read 
in.<p><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Filtering:</font></b></p>
You can use these options to make EQ Companion parse log files faster by 
eliminating parsing of things you are not interested in. These flags are only 
used when opening old log files and they do not do anything while monitoring an 
active log file. There are similar set of flags in the Preferences dialog. The 
difference is these flags are not saved in the INI file and they can be used on 
the fly while EQ Companion is already parsing the log file.<ul>
  <li><b>Ignore all chat</b>: When enabled, EQ Companion will ignore all tells, 
  shouts, OOC, etc. If you are only interested in parsing fights, enabling this 
  option will typically make EQ Companion parse the log file a lot faster. This 
  of course depends on how much chat your log file has in it.</li>
  <li><b>Ignore all loot</b>: When enabled, EQ Companion will ignore all loot 
  messages. Typically log files do not have too many loot messages in them so 
  enabling this option will not help that much.</li>
  <li><b>Ignore all skill increases</b>: When enabled, EQ Companion will ignore 
  all skill increases. Once again, enabling this option will not help too much 
  as there are typically not that many skill messages in log files.</li>
  <li><b>Ignore all fights</b>: When enabled, EQ Companion will not parse any 
  fights. Typically parsing of the fights takes the majority of the parsing time 
  so if you are only interested in parsing looting, skill increases, etc, 
  enabling this option will help parsing speed a lot.</li>
  <li><b>Process all fights</b>: Default setting. EQ Companion will process all 
  the fights.</li>
  <li><b>Process only fights for these days</b>: If you have a very large log 
  file and you only want to parse certain fights and you know what date the 
  fights happened in, setting this option will make EQ Companion parse the 
  unwanted dates a lot faster. To enable this option, just click on a day in the 
  month view control. If you want to check multiple days, you can drag the mouse 
  pointer and choose up to 7 consecutive days. The start and end dates will be 
  automatically filled in the fields above.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>SPECIAL NOTE:</b> EQ Companion has special coding if you have set 'Ignore 
all chat', 'Ignore all loot' and 'Ignore all skill increases' flags and have 
specified a date range for fights. Under these conditions EQ Companion will be 
able to read through the log file very rapidly until it hits your dates. If you 
only specify a single day, EQ Companion will skip through the log file the 
fastest. All it needs to do is read the log file line by line and just do a 
string comparison against the time stamp in the log lines. If you specify a date 
range, it has to parse the time stamp and this slows things down a little bit, 
but it still finds your dates much faster than if you did not enable the 3 
options above.</p>

  <li><b>Start time</b>: The time stamp of the first log line</li>
  <li><b>Current time</b>: The time stamp of the log line which was read in last</li>
  <li><b>Est. time left</b>: While reading in a log file, EQ Companion estimates 
  how long it will still take to finish the file.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Fight stats:</font></b></p>
<p>Here you will see statistics about all fights parsed.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Fights recorded</b>: Total number of individual fights recorded</li>
  <li><b>Most hits / fight</b>: The largest number of damage messages recorded 
  in a single fight. You can use this number to estimate what you should enter 
  in the Preferences window's 'Maximum hits per fight' setting if you want to 
  tweak EQ Companion's memory usage.</li>
  <li><b>Mobs killed</b>: Number of mobs killed</li>
  <li><b>Self EXP gained</b>: How many times you gained self-experience</li>
  <li><b>Party EXP gained</b>: How many times you gained party experience</li>
  <li><b>Overall DPS</b>: Overall damage per second. This number is by no means 
  accurate. Typically you fight all kinds of mobs and some mobs are tougher to 
  fight than others. You might also change weapons, get speed buffs, STR buffs, 
  etc. during your fights. This number here is calculated just by dividing the 
  total number of damage points you have done during the whole log file by the 
  total combined fighting time. A lot more meaningful way of getting your DPS is 
  to combine a lot of fights which have been fought under similar circumstances.</li>
  <li><b>Minimum DPS</b>: Smallest DPS per fight recorded</li>
  <li><b>Maximum DPS</b>: Largest DPS per fight recorded</li>
  <li><b>Max critical</b>: Largest critical hit</li>

The map window pops up when you use the /location (or /loc) command in 
EverQuest. You can also open it using the appropriate menu command in the 
'Windows' menu or by pressing its keyboard shortcut, F9.<p>If you have the map 
already set up for your current zone, it will be displayed. The name of the zone 
is shown in the title bar of the window. The map window has a hidden control 
panel. When you hover the mouse pointer on top of the status bar of the window 
(the panel at the bottom of the window), the control panel opens up at the 
bottom of the window. You can also toggle the control panel with F3-button.</p>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">The control panel:</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>F1 - Show grid</b>: Toggles the coordinate grid on the map</li>
  <li><b>F2 - Clear map</b>: If you have been running around in the zone and you 
  have left traces all over the map, you can clear all of them using this 
  function</li>
  <li><b>F3 - Toggle controls</b>: This toggles the control panel on and off</li>
  <li><b>F4 - Fit window</b>: This will re-size the window so it fits around 
  your map. Basically it will just get rid of extra space around the map. If you 
  press this button twice within a second, the map itself will be scaled to the 
  picture's actual dimensions and the window is resized accordingly.</li>
  <li><font color="#808080"><b>F5 - Set waypoint</b></font>: Not implemented yet</li>
  <li><font color="#808080"><b>F6 - Set point-of-interest</b> </font>: Not 
  implemented yet</li>
  <li><font color="#808080"><b>F7 - Show points-of-interests</b></font>: Not 
  implemented yet</li>
  <li><b>F8 - Show alternate map</b>: If you have multiple map files for the 
  same zone, you can switch between them using this function.<br>
  <br>
  By default EQ Companion is pretty smart about which map it shows. It will 
  always choose the map file that shows your current location. If you have 
  multiple map files that show your current location, it will choose the one 
  with largest scale (I.E. which shows most detail).<br>
  <br>
  For example if you are in Firiona Vie and you have 2 map files, one which 
  shows the whole zone and another that shows only the outpost, when you enter 
  the area that the outpost map shows, EQ Companion automatically switches to 
  that map. When you leave the Outpost, EQ Companion will automatically switch 
  back to the full zone map.<br>
  <br>
  This can cause problems with dungeons, though. Befallen for example would 
  typically have 3 separate maps, one for each floor. Since each floor is on top 
  of each other, you will always be in the X- and Y- coordinates of all the 3 
  maps. By using F8, you can force EQ Companion to use only one of the maps. The 
  title bar will show an asterisk after the zone name once you have 'locked' a 
  map in. When you enter another floor, you can just use F8 and switch to the 
  appropriate map.</li>
  <li><b>F9 - Close window</b>: This will close the map window. Since F9 is also 
  the keyboard shortcut to open the map window, you can use F9 to toggle the map 
  on and off.<br>
  <br>
  If you have opened the map window using F9 button, it will not close on its 
  own. You will have to close it manually. If the map window pops up on its own 
  after you have used the /loc command in EQ, the window will close 
  automatically 5 seconds after the last /loc command.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">Train map:</font></b></p>
<p>Here you can start the map training procedure. For more information about map 
training, refer to <a href="#TrainingMaps">section 7, Training maps</a>, below.</p>
<p><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Choose map:</font></b></p>
<p>Here you can filter out maps. You can choose the continent and if you want to 
see outdoor zones, dungeons, etc. It will show the total number of maps and how 
many there are that meet your filter criteria. The pop-up menu will only include 
maps that meet your filter criteria.</p>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">Status bar:</font></b></p>
<p>The status bar shows the status of the map and it also shows instructions 
while you are training the maps. The 'Speed' panel shows your current running 
speed if you have used the /LOC command at least twice within 5 seconds. The 
'Loc' shows the location under the mouse pointer.<br>
<br>
The way EQ Companion calculates your running speed is the following: First time 
you use /LOC command, EQ Companion will remember your X and Y coordinates and 
the time stamp. This will set the starting point that the speed calculations 
will be calculated against. When you use /LOC command second time within 5 
seconds, it will calculate the distance from the first point to your current 
point. It also calculates how many seconds passed between the points. If you 
keep using /LOC command at least once every 5 seconds, EQ Companion will keep 
showing your running speed and elapsed time based on running time and distance 
traveled.<br>
<br>
If you are not running a straight line, the speed calculation will not be 
accurate because EQ Companion will only calculate your distance from the first 
point to the current point and completely ignore the in-between points.<br>
<br>
To restart speed calculations, just let 5 seconds pass without using the /LOC 
command. This will time out the current speed calculations.<br>
<br>
To get accurate running speed, you should be running a straight line for at 
least 20-30 seconds.</td>

In order to get maps to work, you will need to have a map available for the zone you are in. You will also have to tell the
program about the coordinate system of the map. The first part is easy enough. I’m sure I’m not the only one who has a directory
full of downloaded bitmaps from pretty much every zone in Norrath. The preferences dialog has a new entry where you can assign the
directory where the map files are in.</p>

If the name of the map happens to be exactly the same as the name of the Zone, EQ Companion will load it automatically. Otherwise
you will have to go to the tables-window and assign the map file to the zone.</p>

Once the map is loaded, you have to train it. All you need to do is point 2 places on the map and tell what the EQ location for
those places are. If the map has the coordinates printed on it, you can just use those. Otherwise you can actually go to two known
places on the zone and press /LOC and show on the map where you are.</p>

I have tried to make the training part as easy to do as possible. Basically you just click on the map, type the Y and X coordinates
(in the same way as they are used in EQ) pressing TAB to go from one field to another. Click on another spot on the map and do it again.</p>

Once the map is trained, you do not have to it again. Of course every zone needs to be done separately.
