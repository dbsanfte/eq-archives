		<P>EQ Companion is a program designed to monitor <A href="http://www.everquest.com">EverQuest </A>log file. There are a lot of
		similar programs available but where EQ Companion differs from the rest is that it is designed to be running as you are playing
		EverQuest. It will constantly poll the log file and read new lines in and parse them in real time. This real-time monitoring 
		obviously requires that you have 2 networked computers.</p>
		
		<p>EQ Companion can also be used off-line to parse fights, keep track of loot, skill increases, etc. It is very easy to use has
		very strong melee fight analysing abilities.</P>
	  
		<P>I have also written two other utilities for EverQuest, <a href="http://home.inreach.com/kai/EQTimer">EQTimer</a> and 
		<A href="http://home.inreach.com/kai/EQLogFilter">EQLogFilter</A>. EQTimer is a timer program for timing those MOBs and
		buffs and EQLogFilter is a small utility to help with '<A href="http://penguin.avernus.net">The Tribunal Player and Guild
		History Project</A>' and '<A href="http://ralloszek.stephans.org">Adept's Rallos Zek Site</A>'. Check them out!</P>
