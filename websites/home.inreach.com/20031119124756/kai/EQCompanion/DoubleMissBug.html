		<b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">What is 'Double-miss' bug:</font></b><p>Sometime around 
        the beginning of August-2002 EverQuest started reporting every 'miss' 
        message twice in the log file. Your message window in EverQuest would 
        show them normally, but when you look at the log file, every message 
        would be there twice. Here is an example of what your log file might look 
        like:</p>
        <blockquote>

        <p>As you can see, every 'miss' message is reported twice. Your misses, 
        mob's misses, other fighter's misses. It does not matter if the miss was 
        normal miss or one because of dodge, block, parry or riposte.<p>This bug 
        was fixed by Verant in the 10/16/02 patch (the one with monk, mod rod, 
        etc. nerf)<p>
        <font color="#FF0000" size="4">How does it affect EQ Companion and other 
        parsers:</font><p>This of course affects the statistics EQ Companion 
        provides (also the statistics of every other log parser that uses 
        miss-messages in their calculations). In EQ Companion they affect the
        <font color="#0000FF"><b>Misses</b></font>, <font color="#0000FF"><b>
        Hit%</b></font>, <font color="#0000FF"><b>%1</b></font>,
        <font color="#0000FF"><b>%2</b></font>, <font color="#0000FF"><b>%3</b></font>,
        <b><font color="#0000FF">%4</font> </b>and <font color="#0000FF"><b>%4+</b></font> 
        columns in the fightdata window. The <font color="#0000FF"><b>DLY </b>
        </font>column is not affected except in very rare circumstances and the 
        effect would probably be too small to notice.<ul>
          <li><b>Misses</b>: Obviously this number is twice as large as it 
          should be<br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li><b>Hit%</b>: Since this column divides your number of landed hits 
          by your total number of hits (I.E. landed hits and misses) and the 
          number of misses is twice as large, the Hit% will be reported way too 
          small. For example if you hit 100 swings and miss 100, your Hit% 
          should be 50% (100/(100+100) * 100%), but since the misses are now 
          reported as 200, your Hit% would show up as 33.3% (100/(100+200) * 
          100%)<br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li><b>%1, %2, %3, %4 and %4+</b>: Since these columns show the 
          percentage of single, double, triple, etc. rounds and misses are 
          reported twice, you will see a whole lot more %3, %4 and %4+ rounds. 
          For example if you double-hit and miss both rounds, it will be 
          calculated not as double-hit but as a quad-hit. If one hit lands and 
          other misses, it will be reported as triple-hit.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li><b>DLY</b>: Since the DLY column already ignores double-etc. hits 
          in the same second, misses reported twice will not affect the 
          calculations. I have seen the double-miss reported with the time stamp 
          one second apart, though. This does not seem to happen too often, 
          maybe one in 100 or so. Since the DLY number is reported in whole 
          numbers only, this small margin of error should not have any effect.</li>
          </ul>
        <p><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">What does EQ Companion do to 
        alleviate this:</font></b><ul>
          <li><b>&quot;Fix 
           
          double-miss bug&quot;-flag: </b>In version 0.7 there is a new preferences 
          setting in the '<b>Fight parsing</b>' tab. The setting is called &quot;<b>Fix 
          double-miss bug</b>&quot;. When this is enabled, every 'miss' message that 
          has another miss message following it and the time stamps are either 
          identical or only 1 second apart will be ignored.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li><b>&quot;Double-miss %&quot;-statistic</b>: The stats window 
          has a new statistic added called &quot;<b>Double-miss %</b>&quot;. This will 
          report the percentage of ignored miss messages compared to non-ignored 
          miss messages.<br>
          <br>
          If you have enabled the &quot;<b>Fix  double-miss bug</b>&quot; 
          flag and your log file is affected with the  double-miss bug, this 
          number should be even 100%. If it is anything less, you will get a 
          warning dialog stating that you should probably turn the option off 
          and re-parse the log file as 
          you are probably not affected by the  double-miss bug. Note that it is 
          possible that only part of the log file is affected by the double-miss 
          bug.<br>
          <br>
          If you have 
          this option on and you are parsing a log file prior to August-2002 or 
          after Verant fixes this bug, every legitimate double-miss will be 
          ignored.<br>
          <br>
          This statistic will show 'N/A' for 'not applicable' if you 
          have not enabled the &quot;<b>Fix 'double-miss' bug</b>&quot; option.<br>
          <br>
          By the way, the tool tip for this statistic will show the total number 
          of ignored and non-ignored miss-messages.</li>
