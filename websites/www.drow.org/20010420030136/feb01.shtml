<span class="news">After a sad defeat to our friend the Dain on Thursday, we quickly (a few hours or so) mobilized to exact our revenge upon him on Friday. He experienced a swift death leaving minor casualties: three pets, and one ranger. Oh, and a handful of clerics. <br>

<span class="news">Decent week for BotS. Earlier in the week we killed Zordrak finishing
Caylista's Wifebeater quest, and killed some weeds in Candy Land to outfit our necro pets
in shiny new shadowknight breastplates. Lucky it wasn't a total bust, a few people did get some
new toys.<br>
<br>
Saturday was depressing seeing that Dain Fruitcake IV was MIA. Feeling bloodthirsty and
disgruntled over this, we went to work our aggression out on an overgrown lizard in
Dreadlands and a mutant fish Timorous. Gorenaire left behind a Shield of the White Dragon,
and the Feesh of the Deep gifted us with a Shield of the Water Dragon. Two nice drops from
such gimp dragons.<br>
<br>
Sunday the Dain finally granted us an audience with him, only to poof thanks to the shoddy pathing job in Asswell. <b>GG Verant Pathing.</b><br>
<br>
Team Powerfire, our Test of Tactics team, once again showed the Rathe who the boss was winning the server competition! Congratulations to Seolta, Aegeis, Majdar, Jhana, Finris, and Emil on a job very well done! Good luck on Test!<br>

We dropped Dain 2 more times and saw him poof on what would have been the 4th slayinggg asswell pathing. We of course did some more candyland suiting members up in better than Trakanon BP's with little to no effort.Killed Trakanon 44 and 45. Killed Faydedar twice completing two more druid epic quests. And finally killed Zordak again for Lyly's epic.Nice having a 10th clerics with their epic.
