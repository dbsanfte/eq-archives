<h3>HOW...DID..UGH...</h3>
<div align=center><img src="eq/aow/012002-aow.jpg" border=1></div><BR>
<img src="eq/aow/012002-aowdead.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="10" border=1>This weekend was crazy silly with 2 server-firsts and a beat-down in Sshrae's. The Avatar of War went down today and his ass-beating self got a taste of his own medicine when BotS gathered to take him down. At the start we kinda fucked up on the pull so we got off on a shaky start, but we ended up pissing off the Sinbad look-alike halfway through cause he knew we had the best of him. <a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Tikkon">Tikkon</a> was awarded the <a href="javascript:doloot('/eq/loot/flayedbarbarianhidemask.jpg')">mask,</a> <a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Mistabone">Mistabone</a> and <a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Ootampa">Ootampa</a> on the <a href="javascript:doloot('/eq/loot/ringofdestruction.jpg')">rings.</a><BR><BR>
BotS scheduled the raping of Tunare on Saturday, but perhaps I shouldn't use the word 'raping' since you cannot rape the willing. Ever since Tankish became a jigilow he's had more money than me, so he had first dibs. Put your back into it Tank! <a href="javascript:doloot('/eq/loot/petrifiedheartwoodflamberge.jpg')">Petrified heartwood Flamberge</a> to <a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Sukar">Sukar,</a> <a href="javascript:doloot('/eq/loot/fistofnature.jpg')">Fist of Nature</a> to <a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Sssorn">Sssorn</a> and a <a href="javascript:doloot('/eq/loot/sapencrustedbranch.jpg')">Sap Encrusted Branch</a> for <a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Garreth">Garreth</a> and <a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Nadart">Nadart.</a><BR><BR>

<img src="eq/sshrae/011902-creatorloot.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="10" border=1>During this busy weekend we also had time to take down Xerkizh the Creator. Even though he's probably THE buggiest EQ mob in game with his 'I-have-90-arms-helicopter-rampage' manuever, he was still taken down. It also didn't help that he was duel wielding <a href="javascript:doloot('/eq/loot/glowingmithrilulak.jpg')">these</a> either. Thank god he dropped monk loot since we are really short on MNK/BST loot! We didn't have enough time for the HP, but expect him dead when we fit him in our schedule.<BR><BR>
<div align=center><img src="eq/sshrae/011902-creator.jpg" border=1></div><BR><BR>
I'd also like to take this time to thank a local guild on the Rathe, <a href='http://www.tindilosi.com'>Tindi` Losi.</a> Without their help on coordinating their Statue kill in order for us to try the AoW, we would have never took him down. Thanks TL!

<h3>ADAIREN AFK???!</h3>
Damn, what a week. Dunno where to start so I guess I will list from what is on the top of my mind to the petty shit others could care less about. Many of us are pretty excited for the upcoming AoW attempts for the sole reason of which I don't have to list. If you are lost then --> scroll down to Jan. 12 update!<BR><BR>

<img src="eq/fun/tankishaxe.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="10" border=1>During late last week we had a Ring of Fire raid. It went pretty well, and we killed up to wave 6. Flagrant Warmaster I think his name was. Honestly, I'm just guessing his name from the <a href="javascript:doloot('/eq/loot/axeofthewarmaster.jpg')">loot</a> we got because all I get to do during that fight is stare at a freakin wall.<br><BR>
Vulak, our favorite sugar daddy loot-cow(tm), decided to drop for the 31st time last night. Loot consisted of <a href="javascript:doloot('/eq/loot/dovassirsgauntletsofmight.jpg')">Do`Vassir's Gauntlets of Might</a> which went to <a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Casar">Casar</a>, <a href="javascript:doloot('/eq/loot/palladiusaxeofslaughter.jpg')">Palladius's Axe</a> to <a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Ootampa">Ootampa</a>, and Ranger sword to Davood's kayan. Still only one robe out of 91 Vulak loots; pretty bootylicious if you ask me.<BR><BR>
During my time as a cleric I have to pay attention to guildchat during fights. Who's healing who, who's buffing who, who's ressing who, etc.. Well not only do I get enough /cyber spam and /gu spam as it is, I have to put up with retarded critical hit and lifetap spam now. Gets kinda hard to read stuff when every melee class in the game can now critical hit and ALL at the same time. So I ask you people who read this site, to simply help us all out and /feedback something about having a Critical Hit filter and Lifetap filter put in. Would be MUCHOS appreciated. Here's a <a href='eq/adastuff/feedback.shtml'>link</a> of a few that I've input so far, feel free to send me <a href='mailto:adairen37@hotmail.com'>yours.</a><BR><BR>

<h3>DAOC</h3>
After 3 months since release of Dark Age of Camelot, I would like to give you all some info on how the team is doing.<BR><BR>
Steady leveling, has put GUILD DROW into a position of promise on the Morgan Le Fay server, which is one of the 3 most populated servers in all of DAOC. We have gotten rid of most of the lamers, guild hoppers, and non powergamers, and have pretty much settled into our core group of players who will be leading this team to the usual DROW greatness.<BR><BR>
We have taken forts (solo) along with our alliance partners <a href="http://www.blushn.com/mod/">MOD</a>, we our 4th golobally in rankings on our server in rp's, and guess what, WE HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED TO PVP FULL TIME YET.<BR><BR>
Our first level 50 character was reached yesterday LANNWEN, congrats to you bro. We have a total of about 50 solid players atm with 90% being 40+ and 50% being 45+. As DAOC is still in its infancy, you can look forward to DROW pretty much owning the Morgan Le Fay server in the coming months which is nothing but typical of a DROW.<BR><BR>
Upcoming patches in the next few weeks will make DAOC an even greater game than it is now, and DROW plans on having a long term prescence in the game. If you plan on playing DAOC and want to play with the one of the best and most respected guilds, please head on over to the <a href="http://www.drow.org/forums/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi">forums</a> and let us know your intentions.

<h3>EQ: VI only hires the best!</h3>
Today was quite odd. To start off, Verant tells us that Mark of Retribution is working as intended. Well, it turned out that MoR was bugged and was providing 228pts of dmg shield that stacked with all other damage shields. Not only that, but when used a certain way, it could crash a zone. So we get end up getting this message...<br><br>

The past few days have been more exploring. Got a couple more items from RoF but I never got the SS. p0 you. We also made a trip down to Akheva to try out the upgraded Itraer. Yea this guy is so much fun, I really can't contain myself writing this. Click the pic to see the video of us battling him out.<BR><BR>

<h3>DROW QuakeWorld Servers offline...</h3>
<br>
I'm sorry to announce that I had to shut off our QW servers. They'll remain down until I find a new home for them.<br>
<br>
The servers were graciously being hosted by the company I work for. However, since I'm changing jobs, I'm no longer able to host them there.<br>
<br>
Thanks to all of you hardcore <a href="http://www.quakeworld.net/">QuakeWorld</a> players who always kept the DROW servers full. A big <b>FUCK YOU</b> to cheaters who have caused me to in effect ban innocent people who use the same ISP as you over the years. Get a life.<br>

<h3>Ok so I lied...</h3>
Was hoping to provide you with a full update but lets face it, I'm busy just like you getting AA points.<br><br>
Luclin has been very promising and has some very nice content, but Verant needs some fucking originality. VI Xerox Department gets an A+ in my book for replication. Sshrae snakes for example, were in UO's first expansion pack. Which I would like to mention ALWAYS kicked my ass cause of server-lag and since monsters were server-side, they didn't lag at all. JJ. Second, lay off the Final Fantasy Series. Notice a resemblance?<br><BR>
<div align=center><img src="eq/fun/auronripoff.jpg"></div><br>
Get some creativity please! If you want to continue to copy other people's ideas, then I <b>DEMAND</b> that a 'LaBlue Girl' zone be put in and a 'Save Gary Coleman' quest be implimented ASAP.<BR><BR>
I'd like to take this time to rant a bit more about the Cleric class. Fuck you Verant for not giving us a self-invis. I'm just giddy as a school girl carrying around 4 million invis pots around everywhere I go. And don't say, "well, ada, you have larrikan mask ~~la".<BR><BR>
Take your fucking ~~la and piss off. How would making clerics have self-invis imbalance the game? It can't and it won't, but Verant is just too damn lazy to code it in. Speaking of lazy, put a freakin CRITICAL HIT filter in. For the love of god, we already bought a gig of RAM to run this game smoothly, just for YOU!, at least put a life tap and crit filter in for 'us'.<BR><BR>
On a lighter note, I'm very glad to say that I was wise on how I spent some of my points.<br><br>
<div align=center><img src="eq/fun/critheal.jpg"></div><br>
Like 10k wasnt enough...<BR><BR>
Well enough of my rants and to sum of the week, we cleared NTOV again 2x, and some other shit. If you REALLY REALLY wanna know what we have done to the PRECISE detail, then click <a href="/eq/fun/nosy.shtml">me.</a><BR><BR>
