<span class="news">Fairly busy last few days for the EQ guys... Last Wednesday, the Dain basically walked into camp and just died. Luckily, however, Sorow <b>did</b> survive. Saturday was spent keeling dragons with the deaths of Klandicar and Zlandicar, and Zlandicar's little rodent Vaniki. Afterwards quality time was spent in the Temple of Veeshan with the highlight of the trip being Ploogie's new helmet. <br>
<br>
Tuesday saw the death of both Innoruuk and Cazic. Cazic coughed up something other than melee loot this time (<i>wow!</i>), and Innoruuk throwing some junk our way. <br>
<br>
You know the drill, it's all right <a href="eq/april/april11.shtml">here</a>.<br><br>

<span class="news">With the departure of Nitro and Shz, and the unavailability of one of our best players (Rich), the QWCA team has taken a heavy blow in battles. With great sincerity towards the loss of both Shz and Nitro, they will be missed. I do take great appreciation for the rest of the team that still continues to carry on. A salute to Ruler and Trystan for always being there for the team. Thanks guys!<br>
<br>
That being said, I'm happy to introduce to everyone our new QWCA team members. They will be active members (and a few will be applying for <a href="http://www.drow.org/core/">CORE</a> membership). Please welcome Chopstix, G1, Gel, Zor, Boomer, Devastator, Schmoe, and Silicon to the QWCA team!<br>

<span class="news">Few things to go over so first off: Don't send me any mail about Quake. I have nothing to do with Quake. I update for EverQuest. Talk to <a href="mailto:mIstabone@drow.org">mIstabone</a> or <a href="mailto:doc@drow.org">Doc</a> about it. The news has been archived so the front page doesnt get cluttered.<br>
<br>
Now for the weekend... Dain was up again Friday and was quickly put down after he went on a killing spree across the zone. Bad dwarf. Saturday and Sunday we spent quality time with each other in Temple of Veeshan. The nice thing about this zone is wurms don't split into 125869375 other wurms, yay. Unfortunetly no breast plates dropped but plenty of plate/chain legs did, be sure to check out Aegeis' radioactive plate greaves. We found Tolkorenar on Sunday and wanted to play a few games with him, he thought otherwise. He'll be keeled soon. Klandicar finally popped, so we ended the night with another Sleepers key. Decent weekend for us all.<br>
<br>
Monday saw the fall of Cazic (again) with more melee loot (again). A brain or three would be nice.... Oh, the good thing about holding off updates until the last possible minute:<br>
<br>
Master of the Guard died today in Sleepers. Awesome awesome fight, he dropped a nice new sword for our fearless leader. <br>
<br>
Loot and such is <a href="eq/april/april02.shtml">here</a>.<br><br>
