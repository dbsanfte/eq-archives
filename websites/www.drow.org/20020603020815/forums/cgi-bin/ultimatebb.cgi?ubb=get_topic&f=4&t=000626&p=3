Ok Xyrloc, here's a scenario.<P>You are face to face with a man. This man, from birth, has been taught to hate you, everything about you, and all that is you. This man will not rest untill you are dead. This man begins to attack you. What do you do?<P>I realize the reality of the Middle Eastern situation is much more complicated than this, but the idea of survival is always the same. With a mindless agressor, the only way to survive is to kill the agressor. READ: if you don't kill him, he WILL kill you. No ifs, no ands, no buts.<P>--------------------<P>Voron the Wanderer - <A HREF="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Voron" TARGET=_blank> profile </A><BR>Hierophant -- Blood of the Spider<BR>"Not all those who wander are lost" - J.R.R.

The aggresor in the beginning of your analogy is singular.  At the end of the analogy [he/she] becomes THEM or plural.<P>One man attacks you and you fight back - yes.  But that man/woman attacking you does not justify attacking their brother or sister or mother or cousin who has done no harm to you.<P>--------------------<P>C'mon Shammy Pants!

Seeking a resolution because you (not you, but you in the generic sense) are a humanitarian and love people and seeking a resolution because you hate Arabs or Israelis will dramatically alter the way in which you go about creating/making the resolution happen.</STRONG><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>It's fairly clear how they can be separated.  Take this -<P>For example:  I need to find the differential of 3x squared for a test.  My friend needs to find the same differential on the same test.  I am motivated to find the differential because I want to finish the test and get the hell of the room.  My friend is motivated to find the differential because he will fail the entire course if he does not.  We both find the differential and get what we want.<P>Now, if we both got to where we wanted, WHO CARES IN THE END what motivated us to get there?  I am not stating that it's irrelevant, because hell I may have just copied off my friend or cheated off my differential for 3x squared tattoo. Maybe I want to get out of the room to go kill some babies and he does not want to fail because if he does his father is going to beat the living shit out of him.  It's all irrelevant because the point is <B>THIS TOPIC IS ABOUT THE END RESOLUTION, NOT HOW YOU GET THERE.</B><P>I could care less what people's reasoning or inspiration for the resolution is.  I am tired of people bickering over who is right or wrong when it's fairly obvious that both sides are right and wrong.  Trying to figure out who is more right or more wrong is ridiculous and a complete waste of time and/or human life.<P>Action needs to be taken, period.  I am not to decide what action should be taken and neither is Sssorn, but he is presenting a possible scenario.  All that many people have done is argue who is right or wrong, EXACTLY what he was trying to avoid.  If you want to critique his scenario then do so. Otherwise your demonstrating your inability to read simple sentences.<p>[ April 28, 2002: Message edited by: Helcite ]<P>--------------------<P>El Jobo Cleric

Sushi and Xyrloc I may not have the right to judge you by your statements but as with every person I do have the right to respond to it.  Just to put it out there and this may be from a bias point of view seeing how I conisder Grim and Helcite along with some others with bots friends that these friends are smarter then you then you give them credit for. Calling their views racist and in some of your later posts on how you obivoulsy don't read them completely is insluting them, maybe you should go back and read all of them, but as you said your responses have been exactly what I thought you would say.  <P>  Lizard started this post for simple idea that people will start talking with each other as do Israel and other countries. All I see is you two looking for a way to discredit them each chance you get.  You obviously don't read throughly their posts. If you did you would see what Grim was talking about. In Grim's posting he was accounting to the fact that if you have heard this all your life you view all of jews as if they are harmful to you needless if they have already done anything to you directly or not.  Its kinda of like durring slavery when white childern were told blacks were unequal to them and considerably harmful to them which explains partly why groups started up who lynched them and such.  But don't leave out the other side of this where the people who believe they are a certain way since birth feel like they can't do anything to stop it, just like if you were born thinking your nothing better then a slave what will would you have to change that.  It may not be the best example but at least it makes you start thinking.<P>Just a thought but whatever decision they come too it might have to start with the children if their engrained from the start that sitting down and settling things peacefully is a better solution then killing everyone we might finally get them to consider a real peace agreement. Althought just like in slavery with the older politicans and such its so engrained that they may never be able to really get over the years of hatred but I hope they do eventually. If they have many gods or one gods in their numerous religons there I bet anything that he would rather have his message told in peace then by killing people

If this isn't about survival, what is it about? Why do you left winged arbitrists all want to wait till a dirty nuke its squeezed inside our country and 200,000 americans are dead? Wake the fuck up, this is war, people are killing and hating Americans. You think that this can be solved easily? It is survival. What if a terrorist meltsdown a nuclear power plant in our country? I bet you'll rethink your bullshit.<P>Paden

Grimfeather and Helcite really hit the points. Sushi and Xyrloc are just fucking idiots.<P>No one wants to kill another human being. No one wants to kill an entire group of people. We all want a peaceful resolution. We all want to get to this peace by negotiating. Sssorn's resolution is great. However, as one of the previous posters stated, this hate is so engrained from birth that it probably can not be undone. It's hard to say it but the only viable solution is probably wiping these fuckers off the Earth. One day there will not be a Middle-East. It's only a matter of when "enough is enough" that we will erase them from the map. We are just waiting on that nuclear bomb unless a solution such as Sssorn's gets passed.<P>--------------------<P>Always Faithful<BR>LEEZARDZ 4 ever!<BR>Team  DAoC<BR>"That which does not kill us, makes us stronger."

I never said anyone was less or more intelligent than me.<P>Secondly racist comments have been made.<P>Most perspectives posted in replies are biased toward the Israelies with no concern for Palesinians.<P>I have read all the posts as well.  If the point of this thread was a "matter-of-fact answer" that didn't expect a critical response than NO ONE should have replied at all.  Actually, he presented a history of this thread in which people were unable to argue against the perspective he initially presents.  One can assume that since he reposted it that he wants a critical response.  It's intellectual warfare, if an idea can't stand on its on, it must be destroyed and rethought.  I asked several questions of the initial "plan" which ended up not being much of a plan at all (considering it didn't address where the money will come from, how will criminals be prosecuted, what if there are American losses - as if our country will continue helping if that happens - what about human rights, what about temples, soverignty, other countries in the area, does the US with a history of ineffective and often harmful intervention have the right to intervene at all etc etc etc).  All it called for was a removal of Arafat and policing of US made territory lines by soldiers.  <P>Your analogy doesn't parallel Grim's Bao...yours is pretty much right, his expects the person with hate to be destroyed rather than acknowledge their skewed beliefs and change.<P><BR>Helcite, I hate you (generic you) and I want you to fail so I steal your mathbook so you can't finish the math problem, or I steal your homework and hand it in as my own.  How about that for a motivation analogy.  Because you did the work (history) you deserve to have the work.  Actions, history and motivation matter.<P>--------------------<P>C'mon Shammy Pants!

This is so twisted I don't know where to laugh or cringe. I have to aknowledge THEIR SKEWED BELIEFS? I HAVE TO CHANGE? Are you COMPLETELY retarded?...<P>Okay... let's pretend for a second that in some twisted way it is Israel's responsibility to change their beliefs and relations towards Palestinians who have been terrorizing them for over half a century. Now, do you think the Palestinians give TWO SHITS whether Israelis change or not? Hell, short of converting to Islam, there is NOTHING Israelis can do to stop the way Arabs feel about them. As long as Israel exists, Arabs will attempt to wipe it off the face of the Earth. IS THIS GETTING THROUGH??<P>The good thing about it is... US recognizes that Israel needs support against an enemy that outnumbers her 1000 to 1. Israelis are smarter, much smarter. They are also fighting for survival, and will continue to wade off terrorist attacks untill US will finally takes its hypocritical hold off Israel... and then, you better be ready. When Israel finally gets the freedom to defend itself, she will do what US is too PC to do on its own -- that is to wipe out all countries that are involved in supporting and harboring terrorism. Will there be innocent civilians? Sure, there always are. Does it justify the cause? YES, and none of you arrogant leftist assholes would say otherwise if it were you in Israeli's shoes.<P>--------------------<P>Voron the Wanderer - <A HREF="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Voron" TARGET=_blank> profile </A><BR>Hierophant -- Blood of the Spider<BR>"Not all those who wander are lost" - J.R.R.

I said earlier that I would offer my understanding of the situation but I can't with my limited (although more knowledgable than most) intellect regarding the situation in that region.<P>And how is questioning what others have to say not productive?  It would be easy for me, and American, a nation founded on manifest destiny, take land and appropriate it as you want with no regard for anyone because we are here and they are there so we won't see the effects or have to deal with being removed from our homes to say sure let's just barge in and do our thing.<P>I think it is harder to question our own ideas regarding this region to develop a middle ground.  Then again, I am just a leftist asshole; Bush will probably have me executed someday.<P>--------------------<P>C'mon Shammy Pants!

Yet another mistake that you're making is assuming that the agressor is an individual. The fact is that an overwhelming majority of Arabs support the Jihad, which entails the eradification of Israel and the US. This makes the agressor not an individual, but the entire nation, or rather several nations. Sure, there are some Arabs that don't support it. There were Germans who didn't support the Nazis too, but there weren't enough of them to stop the Nazi movement. Same deal here.<P>Stop ignoring the fact that Arafat and Hussein not only support terrorism, THEY PAY PEOPLE TO DO IT. But I suppose some speech in Arabic where he "condemns" suicide bombings is a more accurate representation of their goals? <P>Open your eyes... life is not precious to them, and that is the only policy of theirs we should adopt.

Well I appreciate some of these posts, especially Hindenburg's.  Conspiracy theorists are always the first to jump at the notion that sometimes the real motivation behind going to war is approval ratings back home.  So yes, I could very well see how Arab leaders would never want the Israeli issue resolved, because it would turn the suffering and the attention of the Arab people away from the common theme of hating the Jews, and onto the Arab governments themselves.  <P>Anyway, Helcite is right in that the idea behind this thread has more to do with discussing solutions, and why these solutions are or are not on the table, and less to do with pointing fingers at who is in the right and who is in the wrong between Israel and the Arabs.  The only things I would call facts at this point are the following:<P>1. The Middle Eastern crisis will never be solved if left to the Israelis and the Arabs, other than by war between them and the resulting destruction of one side or the other.<P>2. The underlying reason for this is that Arabs hate Israel, and will probably always want to destroy Israel.  They will always hate Israel not only for what they deem to be an occupation of Arab land, but also for what Israel stands for: an omnipresent reminder of the economic failure of Islam.  Add to this what Hindenburg suggested, which is that also, the cause against Zionism helps Arab governments polarize their people toward a common enemy, and deflect attention away from their own social and economic failings in the wake of democracy and capitalism.<P>3. The international community is not immune from getting drawn into this conflict, which can have terrible consequences, like 9/11.<P>4. With the unstoppable international dissemination of technological and military information, only a fool would disagree that as decades pass, the risk grows greater and greater that extremist Arabs (groups similar to El Qaeda) will eventually arm and resort to nuclear or biological weapons in this conflict.<P>5. This conflict is extremely dangerous to the stability not only of the Middle East, but the world on a number of levels.  Oil is an obvious reason.  The heavy involvement of the U.S., the world's biggest power, is another.  The proliferation of terrorism is another.  The world is bracing itself against the possibility that the Arab use of suicide bombers specifically targeting civilians will ever be seen as a viable, successfull tool against oppression by militarily superior powers.  If this ever turns out to be the case, terrorism will forever be here to stay.<P>From these facts, my only conclusion is that this crisis will only be solved by force.  There is going to have to be a fight to the finish, and given the inextricable and sometimes inexplicable bond between the U.S. and Israel, the U.S. is going to be in that ring.  So the U.S. has a choice to make.  Do we want to throw the first punch?  Or do we want to wait, as we always seem to do, benign superpower that we are, and just counterpunch, much like Pearl Harbor and much like 9/11 and the war in Afghanistan.  Me personally?  Like Doc Delete, I say we throw the first punch, because I really don't want to be around, especially living in D.C., to see what exactly we will be counterpunching from.<P>But where Docs and I, and a few others differ is how the U.S. should go about doing this.  A blunt, in your face military exercise the reduces the Middle East to a giant parking lot?  Hmm, I am thinking something a little more subtle, which would have the same result without garnering even more acute hatred for the U.S. for being the emperialistic culprit acting in its own interests and supressing and killing blah blah.  Thus, I still think my "international solution" is the best line of action.  This solution will force peace in the area, NOT by the U.S., but by the international community.  This solution will also remove the only legitimate scapegoat the Arabs and anti-semites across the world are using to condem Israel's behavior, which is Israel's occupation and settlement of what should be the Palestinian state.  Once the Palestinians have their state, and once the rest of the solution is implemented, absolutely every negligible justification for Palestinian terrorism will die.  Thus, the solution will make it clear to the Arabs that thereafter, terrorism of any form, will result in the most extreme consequences.  Something akin to the Israeli military invasion of the occupied territories last month, except ten-fold.  Another model for punishment is simply looking at what the U.S. did to the Taliban after terrorists they sheltered and fostered destroyed the WTC.<P>The landscape thereafter is clear:  terrorism in the Middle East will have no viable justification, and it will be punished severely by the international community.  Two outcomes can result, that will lead to the same conclusion:<BR>(1) Even after a Palestinian state is formed, the Arabs will continue to point the finger of hate and blame on Israel.  The suicide bombings will continue, which will result in massive retaliation by the international community (led by the U.S. ofcourse).  Governments will be toppled akin to what happened to the Taliban, thousands upon thousands of extremist Arabs will die, but the Arabs will have no one to blame but themselves for allowing pockets of their culture to fester the fanaticism that inspires terrorism against innocents in foreign lands.  I have a feeling that at some point, when the consequences were shown to be severe enough, the Arabs would start looking inward, and self-policing their extremists would be given a little more attention than the lip-service folks like Arafat give it today.  How laughable is it that right now the reward for terrorism is retaliation by the Israelis which only serves to polarize Arabs more and assist Arab leaders deflect the hate, blame and attention of their people off of themselves?<BR>(2) The Arabs will finally start pointing the finger of their suffering and the economic failure that is Islam onto their own governments, and ferocious internal conflict will result.<P>The outcome will be the same in both cases:<BR>The social and political climate in the Middle East will change by force, either at the hand of the U.S. led international community, or at the hand of the Arab people themselves, with the international community there to assist in molding a kinder, gentler Middle East in the aftermath.<P>That to me looks like a solution.  The big question ofcourse is if the intl. community is up for it.  If the U.S. set the ball in motion, I venture to guess that it would be.  The three biggest obstacles would be:<P>1. Convincing Israel to come on board with such a process which would result in a major (albeit temporary only)infringement upon Israeli sovereignty and autonomy, since Israel would be bound by the will of the intl. community with regard to the boundaries of the Palestinian state and the fate of the settlements in the occupied lands.  In the long run, this would still be in Israel's best interest I believe.  In exchange for this temporary sacrifice in sovereignty, Israel would gain the backing of the world as their 'bodyguard' so to speak, instead of having to defend itself, which has always been another justification Arabs used to hate Israel - Israeli killing of Arabs.  <BR>2. Israel and the U.S. getting over a distrust for the U.N. and the intl. community, which would be imperative in order to make this work.<BR>3. Having a set of brass balls in this country to make this happen.  Would the soccer moms in Ohio who don't have a care in the world (and don't want to), and who's most important concerns in life are whether little Billy deserves his own new lunch box instead of a hand-me-down from his older brother Bobby, vote for leaders who wanted this?  Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....  Democracy's weak underbelly would be put to the test.<p>[ April 29, 2002: Message edited by: Lizard ]<P>--------------------<P>Scaled, for her pleasure<BR><A HREF="http://drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Sssorn" TARGET=_blank>Profile</A> | <A HREF="http://www.drow.org/news.shtml" TARGET=_blank>BotS</A>

I agree that is the true question Sssorn. Will the bleeding hearts, care-free soccer moms elect a leader who supports this plan? And will we trust the U.N.?<P>I can answer the first question at least. It is unfortunate but I am almost certain that they will not support this action. They are still waiting on that "nuke" to blow up before they are motivated enough to vote and put the right people in office or support the ones currently in.  <P>I don't exactly think the United Nations which is made up mostly of Liberal Europe, (yes they are mostly liberal tree huggers with the exceptions of a few countries)actually likes or trusts the United States. They MIGHT support this resolution but quite frankly for this resolution to work the aftermath of breaking it must be so severe that the Palestinians and the Arab world gets the picture as you said. Unfortunately, even if this resolution was presented to the U.N. they would amend it so much that I feel it wouldn't be more than a slap on the wrist. Maybe I am completely wrong but I just don't think the U.N. has the balls even if we get the balls to back this up.<P>--------------------<P>Always Faithful<BR>LEEZARDZ 4 ever!<BR>Team  DAoC<BR>"That which does not kill us, makes us stronger."

Xyrloc, you were right in only one things you've said, you are a leftist asshole, if it were up to you or people with your unrealistic hippy views to run our country we'd be in ruins.. thanks God<P>maybe for a minute you can step back and realize what you are saying.. you act as if you resent this country.. yet it does everything for you.. we can't save everyones life, be realistic. You obviously have no concern for people who die for this country every single fucking day, they are over there fighting for their lives and for our well being and you're sitting here criticizing military action, what the fuck is wrong with you, I hate assholes like you who don't appreciate what you or your family has been given by this country. Yet you don't do shit or give a shit. And if you say otherwise, it is evident through your attitude in your posts how you really feel, You can twist my words all you want but people who sit back and realize what this entire thread is about will realize how much of a fuckass you really are.<P>Paden

Thank you Sssorn and Hindenburg for being so clear on the issues at hand here.  In regards to the resolutions being discussed here and the role of the international community / UN in this position it seems quite negative atm.  I am basing this on the choice for commission members that un is sponsering to "investigate" the incidents at Jenin.  <P>Three members were chosen: one is a known fanatical Arab, one is a member of the red cross who was instrumental in making sure the red cross flag with never wave inside israel. He refers to Israel as a racist state.  The third I am unsure of.  Israel is not to keen on this group and is not allowing them into the country, can you blame them?<P>It seems the international community would rather hold tightly onto the double standard they engage in when they call out Israel's military actions than bring the issue full circle.  Perhaps the politics of this particular region including oil, water, and logistics have a role that we cant fully grasp.<P>Personally, the situation in the middle east makes me feel angry as well as sad.  What kind of planet do we live on?  The irony of the role of religion can not be understated here, it makes the question what kind of god do you believe in so much more engaging than the cliche, do you belive in god.<P>Just as Palestinians need to look within their own community to begin solving their problems, so too, all of us must start with our own selves.  All attack is a call for help, and when we look to blame, justify and rationalize we are in illusion about the truth.<P>When the question what is the truth becomes more important than who is right and who is wrong there is an instant shift and change can occur.  Until that moment, i see the world will be lead by fear.

It should be pointed out that historically Europe is a VERY anti-semetic area.  All of Europe turned a blind eye to Hitler's rise in power, they stood around watching Germany re-arm themselves far beyond limits allowed by WWI treaties, and not only did they do NOTHING to prevent Hitler from arresting and persecuting Jews, but not a single country in Europe allowed Jewish refugees to cross thier borders to escape.  The political elete in Europe justified every act of Nazi Germany until Poland was invaded and even then they were reluctant to get involved.  This same mindset can be seen today.  Look at France for instance, almost 20% of the counrty voted for a borderline Nazi-sympatizer (Le Pen) to participate in the presidential runoffs.  Europe by and large has a very small number of Jews relative to a rather significant minority of North African and Middle Eastern Arabs.  The United States had to warn Americans from even going to Italy last Easter weekend for fear attacks.    <P>The international community and more specifically Europe are much more comfortable pointing to America to handle difficult situations and then judging us on our actions than they are taking a pro-active role to seek a solution.  They hold it against us for using American morals and American interests in our foreign policy.  Well whose morals and interests are we supposed to use if not our own? The Middle East's?  I refuse to be forced to "put myself in thier shoes" when most of those shit-bag contries can't even construct a 2-story building.<P>In regards to Sssorn...<BR>Good post.  While I may not think that the Palestinians deserve nor have earned anything and that by giving into thier demands ony validates thier use of terrorism, there is probably no other "realistic" course of action.  As long as it is made ABUNDENTLY clear on the world stage that ANY act of state sponsored, funded, or condoned terrorism on Israel will result in the hostile ocupation of all land with full U.S. backing.  Let's see how badly the Arabs really want peace.  Something to think about in your senerio is where will key elements of the world side in your "eventual conflict."  Take China for instance.  I doubt they give a shit about Arabs or Jews, but I guarentee they hold the price and supply of thier oil in very high priority.  Whose side would they chose and would it be important enough for them to get involved?  Interesting question I think.<P>In regards to Xyrloc...<BR>I don't think anyone here is genuenly racist.  Today's America is by far the most socialy, ethnicly, and religiously tolerent country in the history of the world.  Many of us by our gas, work with, study next to, and befriend Arabs everyday without a 2nd thought.  The difference between these Arabs, and many of those in the Middle East, is that the guy who works at Texaco has not made killing me his life's goal and chooses to love his children rather than make martyrs of them.  An unbreechable difference of values I suppose.<P>In regards to eveyone else...<BR>Go easy on Xryloc.  The fanatical views from the left counter the fanatical views from the right to express the interests of the largely silent moderate majority.  And vice-versa.  Difference of opinions are as American as the difference of people who live here.  Believe it or not, anti-American views are a very American concept.  Although it is sad that some people can't get past our faults to see that our vurtues far exceed our vices.<P>To make an ungodly post even longer, did anyone else hear that Kuwait made it clear that they would consider an attack against Iraq an act of war on thier "Arab brothers?"  Ungreatful pricks.  Although these are the same people who gave up thier entire counry to a mighty Iraqy army so dedicated in thier resolve that they surrendered by the thousands at the sight of a single American tank.  Fucked up part of the world for true.

Man, I really should keep up with the news more considering my situation.  So hard to pull my head out of the "EQ Syndrome" though.  BFE ususally equals Bum-Fuck Egypt (not sure where that expression started), but in my case it means Bum-Fuck England.  Hinden, you are correct about the Europeans, they are quick to say America-this, America-that, but they sent, what, 1,000?!?  troops to Afghan near the END of the battle in that section of the world?  And then they talk trash because they "finished" the job the Americans couldn't.  Ya, I may just be a 22 year old guy in the military, still young by any considerations, but what's going on in the world today strikes me as pretty fucked up.  Especially since soon I'll be thrown into the mix, heck, we already have alot of Americans in their experiencing quite a shitty life because of all this.  I almost never paid attention to politics, I don't know the difference between left, right, republican, democratic.  I was a math-science sort of kid in school, and I don't vote (ironic since the gov't controls my life).  I've admitted I'm a hypocrite many times in my life, and DAMN NEAR everyone will be in there life at some point.  Anyway, /rant off.  I've heard some good points and learned a few things from this post, so thanks all for enlightening a guy who's got his head in the proverbial EQ Box.<P>--------------------<P><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=190294" TARGET=_blank><B>_Marlonius Fieldmedic_</A></B><P>59 Monk - League of Levity
