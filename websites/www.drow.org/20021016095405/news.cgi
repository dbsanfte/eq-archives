  <h3>Still alive and kicking!</h3><br>
We're still alive and well. Vex Thal is among our chief priority such that I've begun to see these guys in my sleep:

Unfortunately the time spent in these zones slowly drives people insane such as our very own mad monk:

  <h3>Til we meet again.</h3>
<p>With an apparent lack of updates, I bring you a formal post to everyone who reads the page, that plays EQ and for the ones that have retired. I know I have had a few MIA updates to RL decisions and situations but this one is the last chapter in my book.<br><br>
I will no longer be playing EQ and am officially retiring Adairen. Somehow I happened to stumble upon quite few disappointments during the past month or so and today is the day to make the call. I don't feel like listing all of the 'let-downs', but just to top it off (as most of you know), high-end content is more of a chore than it is a leasure. <a href='http://www.drow.org/archive.shtml'>Over a year and a half</a> I have had the time of my life healing BotS from Zlandicar to Aten Ha Ra and I'm going to miss the 'fun' that was there. But all good things must come to an end.<br><br>
To my fellow guildmates, keep kicking ass like always and I'm going to miss a lot of you.<br><br>
Thank you viewers for your praises on the updates I have made, they made my updating very enjoyable and expanded my mind to bring you useless <a href="cgi-bin/ss.cgi?t=1?ss=/eq/adastuff/tunareporn.jpg">nonsense</a> for the day.<br><br>
See you all in the next online frenzy.</p>

<p>As some of you may well know, the past months I was appointed to design the new DROW Organization website and <a href='mailto:doc@drow.org'>Doc</a> wants to get this thing launched by the end of the summer. I have been doing what I can with the little freetime I have, and I just wanted to let you all know that it should be done within this month. I'm very excited and I hope you guys will like the new design as much as I do. Also, I'm on a mission and that is to pass up Emil on profile hits.

  <h3>The 2002 DROW Lan Party</h3><br>
Well, the day came and went. It seemed to have went faster than our previous Lan parties, as Sunday came before any of us realized it.<br>
<br>
<a href="about.shtml#structure">Core members</a> of Organization DROW came from various parts of the country to setup at <a href="mailto:tick@drow.org">Tick's</a> house to geek out for the weekend.<br>
<br>
We played bunches of different games, ranging from Medal of Honor II, to old school QuakeWorld. We went until 5 in the morning on Sunday, finishing up with Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix, at which <a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Dravin">Dravin</a> kicked all of our asses soundly. :-(<br>
<br>
I was a little lazy this year and didn't take as many pictures as I usually do, but I do have some:<br>
<br>
<a href="cgi-bin/ss.cgi?t=1?ss=/images/drowlan-2002-1.jpg">Group picture at dinner</a><br>
Left row, front to back: Kayan, Dravin, Fitten, Poly (Ozzy's bro), Trystan<br>
Right row, front to back: Tick, Ozzy, Mistabone, C'Baoth, Me<br>
<br>
More images:<br>
<br>
<a href="cgi-bin/ss.cgi?t=1?ss=/images/drowlan-2002-2.jpg">Random LAN Party pic #1</a><br>
<a href="cgi-bin/ss.cgi?t=1?ss=/images/drowlan-2002-3.jpg">Random LAN Party pic #2</a><br>
<a href="cgi-bin/ss.cgi?t=1?ss=/images/drowlan-2002-4.jpg">Random LAN Party pic #3</a><br>
<a href="cgi-bin/ss.cgi?t=1?ss=/images/drowlan-2002-5.jpg">Random LAN Party pic #4</a><br>
<br>
And lastly, a special message for <a href="mailto:hawken@drow.org">Hawken</a>, who once again promised to make it to our Lan party, just like last year, even said he was leaving and disappeared from IRC, and never showed up. Never called. Nothing. We predict that he'll disappear for several weeks and then show up on IRC pretending like nothing ever happened.. Just like last time.<br>
<br>
So for him we have a special <a href="images/9010100.mpg">message</a>. Enjoy.<br>
