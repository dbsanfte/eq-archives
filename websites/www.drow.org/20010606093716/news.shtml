Wow.  Aside from that quick Lord Yelinak update a few days ago, it's been quite some time since the last update.  First, I'd like to catch up on what happened between the last real update and the Lord Yelinak killing.  We killed one of the -cars (who cares, really?) for a Sleeper's Tomb key for Pollux, Vindicator several more times (naturally) for breastplates for Khevral, Wynterstar, boots for Caylista, Tikkon, and an earring for Garrm.
<br>
<br>
As I mentioned in the Lord Yelinak update, we killed a new dragon in Temple of Veeshan, Telkorenar.  It was yet another server first, but Telk being the poosae that he is, it's not <i>that</i> "newsworthy."  He dropped a sword for Aegeis that, at best, he'll use only at Hoshkar and Zlandicar for its disease resist.  Sukar took the shd/mnk/rog-only neck from Telk, and Blaal got the pauldrons.
<br>
<br>
After a quick whipeout, we also killed another 425 Dain to get a belt for Pollux, and nothing else that's really worth mentioning.  He really should start dropping some hackle hammers and crowns soon, he's just not putting out like he used to. :~(
<br>
<br>
Now to catch up to the Lord Yelinak update, the day of that particular update we had, arguably, our best night in Temple of Veeshan.  Chain legs dropped for both Desspot and Finris, giving Finris a "complete" set, sans one bracer.  There were other miscellaneous drops, most noteworthy perhaps was the plate helm, which now allows Ozzyd to look <i>even more retarded</i>.  You didn't think it was possible, did you?
<br>
<br>
We made a quick (read: loooong) trip to Veeshan's Peak with the original goal of killing Phara Dar, but we came out with only the corpses of Silverwing and Hoshkar to show for it.  I'm fairly proud to know that the BotS motif of killing difficult mobs and then being completely owned by kayan mobs lives on.  Anyway, congratulations to Sukar on The Scimitar of Lifestealing (you'd best win the BotB tonight, or /gr, officer or not!), and Khyck on his Grey (pink?) Suede Shoes.
<br>
<br>
Continuing on (I told you this was a long update), we've continued to kill Vindicator, yielding an earring for Ozzyd, and boots for Lyly.  We also killed Velketor because, again, he was up and got a robe for Felenia.
<br>
<br>
Yesterday saw our deepest excursion into Sleeper's Tomb, crawling our way toward the warders.  Sadly, a certain guild from Lanys, whom shall remain nameless (but not <a href="http://eqconquest.inet.net.nz/">linkless</a>) caused the four warders on <i>every single</i> server to be despawned by GMs, and we didn't get a chance to kill any of them.  Aside from that little slip-up, the night went extremely well in terms of Priceless drops - 2 hammers, 3 spears, and 1 warsword.  Master of the Guard, The Progenitor, and The Final Arbitor, of course, all had spells.
<br>
<br>
I believe that's everything.  On tap for tonight is Dain and Innoruuk, with Cazic sometime this week as well as Yelinak tomorrow.

Just a quickie of an update for you all today until tomorrow morning.  Tonight, for the first time on The Rathe, Lord Yelinak was killed, essentially giving us a third dragon to kill for Sleeper's keys, and another method/excuse for our members to give head to King Tormax.  Naturally, SLR extraordinaire Sukar had to be the first member to give this new type of head to the King.<br>
<br>
Sure, we've done other stuff this past week - Breastplate Vindi machine, Sleeper's, Klandicar, Zlandicar, Dain, even a new Temple of Veeshan dragon - but I'll leave that update until tomorrow.<br>
<br>
Until then, <a href="eq/june/june01.shtml">check out</a> all the loot and all three (3!) Yelinak screenshots.<br>
