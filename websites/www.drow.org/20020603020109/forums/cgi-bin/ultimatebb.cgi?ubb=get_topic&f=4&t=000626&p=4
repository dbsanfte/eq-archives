I look at it this way.  This is about the U.S. to me, not about Israel.  From my objective, neutral perspective, Israel, given all of the massive problems that come with it, is more of a burden to the U.S., than an asset.  The U.S. has allies all along the borders of the Middle East now, NATO encompasses almost all of Europe, we are on good terms with Pakistan now, not to mention several Arab countries as well, so people still want to feed the bullshit that Israel is a "strategic" ally?  My idea of strategic is to say to Israel "you are going to swallow the international solution son, because I am tired of shouldering the load for you."  When Israel cries "but everyone is anti-semitic!", our strategic response is "Tough shit son.  I would prefer a solution that might be a little unfair toward you than having to stand next to you and get bitch slapped by the world for another 100 years, because you are paranoid about everyone's motivations."<P>Frankly, given the position Israel is in right now, with so many enemies, how is it realistic to expect to have your cake and eat it too?  Sure, the international solution will not be entirely in favor Israel.  It will be neutral.  How will it be guaranteed to be neutral?  Hmm, perhaps because Israel's big brother the U.S. will be sitting in that international tribunal carrying around a very big hammer to ensure Israel isn't forced to bend over too much.  What is more, regardless of how anti-semitic the solution is, the end result will be the world acting as Israel's bodyguard, waiting at the ready to "Afghanistan" any Arab country that continues promoting violence against Israel.  Where would be the anti-semitism in that?<P>Now comes the funny part.  Here I am talking about how I view Israel neutrally.  I view Israel from the standpoint of an American who wants what is best for America, period.  But given the way things are in this country, if people dare discuss Israel in a neutral manner, based solely upon its utility to America, I am viewed as borderline anti-semitic for having these views.  As if unless I am 100% behind Israel, I am anti-semitic.  Uh, fuck you.  I am neutral here in the sense that all I want is what is best for the USA - the greatest country in the history of the world.  Far greater and endlessly more important to me personally than Israel.  <P>Getting to the simple point here, Israeli and American paranoia that the world is anti-semitic to me is not justification enough to forego an international solution to the Middle Eastern crisis.  It is just a weak and sorry excuse by whiny babies who want to have cake while lunatics all over the place are scrambling to find weapons to kill them with.<p>[ April 30, 2002: Message edited by: Lizard ]<P>--------------------<P>Scaled, for her pleasure<BR><A HREF="http://drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Sssorn" TARGET=_blank>Profile</A> | <A HREF="http://www.drow.org/news.shtml" TARGET=_blank>BotS</A>

If we sat by and watched Israel duke it out with the Arabs, and on the off-chance that the Arabs take out Israel, who do you think is next?  Do you REALLY think the Arabs will stop there?  I know that I'VE kept my head in a hole most of my life, but even I realize that fanatics like this won't stop until they have "converted" all the heathens.  Israel is a buffer between the US and the Middle East (which most of those residing there HATE Americans).  Remove that buffer, and.....<P>You get the picture, wake up, you can't be neutral in this situation because if you do you're inviting the "terrorists" to convert the masses.<P>My viewpoint?  *dons flame-retardant gear*  Nuke um all, I say get our IBM defense network straight and NUKE the whole lot of the bastards.<P>I'm pretty sure it's easy to see where I stand, the old "You're either one of us, or one of them.

I disagree with you.  Simple as that.  If there were no conflict with Israel to polarize the hate of the Arab masses toward the West, Arab leaders could sell American interests and influence to their people much easier, and the Middle East would most certainly not be the anti-American hate fest it is today.  Take a look at our partnership with Muslim Pakistan recently.  Did we need an Israeli buffer for that?  In truth, wouldn't this partnership have gone even more smoothly without America's support for a country most Arabs despise?<P>Coloring Israel as a necessary buffer, when Israel itself is the root of almost every justifiable grievance Arabs have with the West, is silly.<p>[ April 30, 2002: Message edited by: Lizard ]<P>--------------------<P>Scaled, for her pleasure<BR><A HREF="http://drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Sssorn" TARGET=_blank>Profile</A> | <A HREF="http://www.drow.org/news.shtml" TARGET=_blank>BotS</A>

You have a point, but I do not feel that the Arabs' tentative peace with the US is realistic.  I feel it is a facade they are using to rally us against Israel.  They have perpetrated numerous terrorists actions on Israel (as well as Israel counter-strikes on them).  We have warred against Arabians in the past, and they do not forget this.  We have not warred with Israel, they remember this. (If I am incorrect, please correct me, I never did pay much attention to history in school and am just now learning about oversea relations since I'm in the mil)  Their hatred towards Israel is a prime example of their ability to "hold a grudge", and they hate Americans also.  I understand your sentiment that Arabians COULD have had peace with us, but not considering our past actions and it's too late to take those back.  They consider us enemies, no matter what politics they may play to get us to help them by hindering Israel's ability to defend itself.<P>I am biased, this is quite obvious, I'm in the military, defending our homeland.  I stand by my previous exclamation, nuke 'um.  If we showed the other countries not to PISS us off, this shit wouldn't be the way it is now.<P>--------------------<P><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=190294" TARGET=_blank><B>_Marlonius Fieldmedic_</A></B><P>59 Monk - League of Levity

I dunno about anyone else, but someone is not my enemy unless they actually say so.  There are plenty of people that dislike who I am, the things I do, and who I associate with, but I don't consider them my enemies.<P>I wouldn't say that the Arabs are our enemies.  I would say that they may really dislike, or even hate us.  Who am I, though, to question what motives they have, or to presume they are going to act upon those motives.  It would be wise to take caution, but attacking them merely because they "hate" us is illogical and immoral.<P>I tend to agree with Sssorn, Israel pretty much is the reason that several Arab nations dislike us.  I don't think they are a buffer, but rather the cause.<P>As for the solution:  The international isn't on the same page as us.  I do not think that they are going have the bravado that it takes to fix this "problem" up.  There are other, non-war-related reasons that several European nations are refusing to support the US.  The entire issue delves into the world of socio-economic imperialism that is inherent in the capital system of the United States.<P>--------------------<P>El Jobo Cleric

The Arabs are our enemies in my opinion. Anyone who hates me or wishes to kill me over reasons as stupid as religion, economic status, and my way of life are my enemies.  I'll make a nice prediction. The Middle-East will be no more in 50 years.<P>Sssorn is right in the fact that most of the hatred for the U.S. is due to our support of Israel. I do, however, think Israel is still a buffer for the West. The Arab world hates us. They are going to hate us for much, much longer. So in the meanwhile, we need Israel to be that buffer. If we stay neutral and don't play the bodyguard role such as in Sorn's plan and eventually let the Arab world ransack Israel then Europe and the West is next. This will probably not happen considering the intelligence and military sophistication of Israel. The Jews are smart. They are probably the smartest people in the world and no I'm not Jewish. This of course is all hypothetical and from the mind of a 17 year old. Your solution is great Sssorn but we will indeed have to wield a big hammer.

Apparently I came across as a "whiney baby" but the simple fact remains the international policey historicaly and continualy is shaped anti-semiticism.  And I think you realize Sssorn, that not supporting Israel 100% in no way makes you anti-semitic and is not important to this discussion,  but the fact that some entities ARE anti-semitic and thus will not support Israel are pertinent to the subject of an international solution.  <P>You are right that Israel has been a pain in our asses since it's inception, but where we stand today, Isreal is one of our most powerful -true- allies outside of Britian and values American interests as much as we do thier's.  There are few countries outside of North America who will go to the fence with us on almost any issue up to and including war, and there are none as powerful.  While there may be a cause-effect relationship, I don't think you can blame Israel for attacks against us anymore than you can blame Keystone Light for a husband beating his wife.  Besides, who would you rather have in your corner at the end of the day: a rich power nation that projects American ideals or a bunch of third would opressive dicatorships that fight amoungts themselves as much as they do the rest of the world.  To me, in this situation, pro-Israel is pro-American<P>I also think you overestimate Arab support. These same Arab leaders who are coopereating and talking peace one minute, are hosting telethons that raise hundreds of millions of dollars for Palestinian militents and suicide bombers the next.<P>By the way, thanks for starting this topic Sssorn.  I like seeing other people's persepectives in all this mess.

Unfortunately, we have to hope that our political genuises (oxymoron?) don't do something VERY STUPID, like helping the Arabs take down Israel.  I'd say God help us, but I'm agnostic (perhaps this plays into my Nuk'um attitude, who knows).  If we actually did something that incredibly stupid, we'd be inviting the Arabs to begin launching terrorist attacks on us, think Sept 11th was bad?  Just imagine if Israel weren't there, those guys live with terrorist bombs daily, could you picture that happening in the US?    <IMG SRC="mad.gif" border="0"><P>--------------------<P><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=190294" TARGET=_blank><B>_Marlonius Fieldmedic_</A></B><P>59 Monk - League of Levity

Marlonius you have my complete respect and admiration as a member of our military.  Defending the United States of America and all of the wonderful things this country stands for is nobility exemplified.  Cheers to you mate. <P>I appreciate the posts.  I realize none of us are experts in the field here, but one thing I have learned in my 33 years is that there is always something to be learned from the wisdom of common folk.<P>It is disheartening that the only legitimate caveat to the "international solution" concept I laid out is a deep distrust for the international community and fears of international anti-semitism.  I personally have a little more faith in the international community than that, having lived in five different countries for extended periods myself.  How can Israel ever really hope to be embraced by the world if it never reaches out and says "I have faith and trust you"?  Where will this ever really get Israel or the U.S. down the road other than to further alienation, distrust and hatred?<P>I think it is time to reach out to the world and say we are all brothers here and we have a problem.  Let's come together and solve it by showing good faith and trust in each other.  The breach between Israel and the Arabs is too deep and too painful to heal, but the breach between Israel/USA and the rest of the world is not.  That is where the solution should lie if you ask me.<p>[ April 30, 2002: Message edited by: Lizard ]<P>--------------------<P>Scaled, for her pleasure<BR><A HREF="http://drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Sssorn" TARGET=_blank>Profile</A> | <A HREF="http://www.drow.org/news.shtml" TARGET=_blank>BotS</A>

Well I'd like to say a couple things.<P>First, Israel I suppose is both a buffer and the cause.  In some aspects Israel is preventing the Arabs from attacking the US.  In other aspects it is the simple cause for the hatred of the United States.  The difference is that if Israel is "gone" - no I'm not saying that's the solution or anything - and the Arabs decide to attack the United States all of Europe, Japan and other Asian nations are going to say "Go tear them a new asshole."<P>It is CLEAR what the US is about, propoganda or not, everyone in the world knows that the United States intentions are (even if they are self-serving.)<P>Inherent in that truth is a two-fold caveat:<P>First, the International Community distrusts the United States.  I cannot fully argue that Europe does not, but I know tons about Japan.  The US HAS NEVER abandoned its imperialist nature.  It may have done so politically, but socio-economically it has not.  Japan has always recognized that fact, and that is why they resisted the penetration of US investment in their economy until very recently.  <P>I feel the "double-standard" that has been mentioned in reference to European nations stems from something similar. If the US says "no, don't be imperialist" but in some respects continues doing so then the International Community can be expected to respond in kind.<P>Second, if a solution is created, led by the United States, the International Community can justifiably predict that the US will continue its general trend.  They can assume that we will attempt to create an essnetially "American" democracy, based on essentially "American" ideals.  This harkens back to the fact that the United States has never abandoned its socio-economic imperialism.<P>I fully realize that saying that the International Community doesn't support our position only because of this is ridiculous.  Their position, I am certain, is based on a network of beliefs unique to each country.<P>Generally speaking, though, the International Community wants a solution that is benificial FIRST to the involved nations and second to the rest of the world, including the United States.  I agree Sssorn, your solution would work by and large.  However, to some degree it is evident that it will put the United States in a strategically advantaged position, allowing us to leverage beliefs and ideologies as we see fit.<P>That, I believe, is the roadblock to finding a viable solution.<p>[ April 30, 2002: Message edited by: Helcite ]<P>--------------------<P>El Jobo Cleric

I have a better solution. Take off this hypocritical hold US has on Israel, and give Israel full freedom to operate as they wish in their own defense. Watch Israel obliterate any terrorist breeding country that decides to fuck with them, untill the terrorists finally realize it and stop (doubtful), or dissapear from face of the Earth. GG?

hey xyrloc. do us all a favor and open up a can of stfu. Being a war veteran myself, seeing people like you post your biased bullshit about how to protect people makes me sick. You have never had to put your life on the line for your country, and after reading your few posts i doubt you would even consider it.<P>You are one of those who would like to have someone like clinton in office at this time who had no inclination as to what was going on in the world, but would rather use his office for personal gains.<P>Get off your high horse of everyone posting here is a racist and read their posts. They are posting what they believe to be solutions to our current world situations. You have yet to post a single solution, you would rather post some single minded individual views. <P>Until you can come up with something original and your own solution do us all a favor and just stfu, we dont really care until you can do that.<P>And just in case you are as moronic as you seem to be, stfu means shut the fuck up, just so you understand.<P>--------------------<P><B>Trivilus Nightblade</B><BR><B>Warlord in BotS</B><BR><B>Core Member</B><BR><B>BotS Recruiter</B><BR> <IMG SRC="http://www.drow.org/images/spid.gif"> <BR><A HREF="http://http:www.drow.org" TARGET=_blank>DROW</A> : <A HREF="http://drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Trivilus" TARGET=_blank>EQ Profile</A>

Howdy all,<P>Interesting discussion here.  I think for the most part it has been completely off on a tangent it is still interesting.  I won't be posting any nonsense about who is right or wrong myself as I am in full agreeance with you Sssorn that at this point it is irrelevant.  <P>I just wanted to pose a question to your solution.  I like your solution for the most part but I get hung up on one part.  The disciplinary action as a result of one side breaking the rules.  So far we have only heard that it would most likely be the Arabs who would break the rules and then we could proceed to wipe them out.  That could very well happen if this solution were to be the route taken by the international community.  <P>My question is, what would happen if Isrealis broke the rules? How fast would we see the world taken action on them?  Would US and the international community come down hard and swiftly on them?  How would big corporations that have financial stake in that region of the world influence this?<P>I think the only way it could work is if the international community could assure both sides that they would be completely unbiased.  Make no mistake, in this situation if Israel broke the rules first we had better be prepared to send them packing just as fast as we would do to the Palestinians.  Other than that it seems about the best plan I've heard yet.<P>Fobban

The solution would address a limited set of things:<BR>1. Definition of territory.<BR>2. Monitoring.<BR>3. Breaches.<BR>4. Remedies.<P>Nothing more, nothing less.<P>1. Definition of Territory.<BR>This would cover the geography for the Palestinian state.  Once the Palestinian state is formed, all other issues on Israeli land go away.  Why?  Because once the Palestinians have their own state, Israel is free to do absolutely everything it wishes upon Israeli soil, and if the Palestinians don't like it, then bye bye.  Israel could erect walls on its side if it so chose, it could erect armaments and border controls, it could make entering and exiting Israel as tough as Israel so chose to protect itself, and the Palestinians could no longer object because now they had their own land.  And if they did object, do not pass GO, and go straight to the breach and remedies section.<P>2. Monitoring.  Part of the solution would involve monitoring of both sides.  The leniency by which each side would be monitored would be commensurate with its violence toward the other in the past and present.  Thus initially, there would be rigorous monitoring of the Palestinian state, to assure that it was not using its newly found autonomy and independence merely to make preparations for further violence against Israel.  Monitoring akin to what we see in Afghanistan right now.  <P>3.  Breach.  Breaches of the solution would basically come down to any state sponsored violence or plans for violence perpetrated against the other side, or the international peacekeepers/monitors.  This could be set out in very clear terms.  Any suicide bombing or attack proven to have any link to or blessing from the Palestinian authority, would be considered a breach.  Reciprocally for Israel.  Other forms of breach would inevitably be addressed, not entirely dissimilar to forms of breach one might find in any controlled real estate community, such as encroaching neighboring land, etc.<P>4. Remedies. Simply look to how the U.S. handled Afghanistan to find what remedies would lie in store for the side who breached and failed to make immediate reparations and changes required to cure the breach.  But instead of the U.S., this would be an international coalition encharged with keeping the peace, by whatever means necessary.  The international coalition would work with the aggrieved side, which would most definitely end up being Israel.  The remedies language would go into detail about how a side might be able to cure a breach if acting in good faith, like say if something happens by accident or without control.<P>The Israelis would not breach.  They would not make settlements in the new Palestinian state.  They would not carry out attacks against Palestinians.  The most they would do is continue to conduct espionage in the Palestinian state and elsewhere, and fortify their land against attacks.<P>Lately in the news there has been much talk about the BIG FOUR - U.S., EU, UN and Russia getting together to discuss a solution.  This is what I am talking about, only my solution is not as passive as what is discussed in the news.  The U.S. would essentially work as Israel's attorney-in-fact in the proceedings leading to a solution.  The U.S. would make sure that the solution was what the U.S. determined to be reasonably acceptable to Israel, but more importantly, reasonably acceptable to the U.S.  If Israel didn't like a part here or there that the other parties to the solution demanded, then if the U.S. was OK with it, tough shit Israel, one cannot have every cake and eat it too.  Either way, with the U.S. as its voice, I would be supremely confident that Israel would be well represented and the solution would be fair to both sides.<P>This is just a rough sketch of the idea, and there would be 1000s of details to work out, but if anyone has comments as to the over all concept and its feasibility, please share.<p>[ May 07, 2002: Message edited by: Lizard ]<P>--------------------<P>Scaled, for her pleasure<BR><A HREF="http://drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Sssorn" TARGET=_blank>Profile</A> | <A HREF="http://www.drow.org/news.shtml" TARGET=_blank>BotS</A>

I like to see people place restrictions on an Israeli response. It really is cute. There is a real old philosophy that says to prevent someone from committing a violation of your natural rights you have the right to do ANYTHING that prevents that from happening. It's really the only sort of idea that guarantees your rights are not violated. There has never been any event in history where group A has killed group B, and by group B giving group A something has group B gained a long lasting peace. In this situation its more than obvious. If you create a government around a terrorist leadership, you create a terrorist state. A terrorist state on the boarder of a state which is by far the most currently threatened country in the world.<P>You ponder the question, what if Israel broke some rules first. I highly doubt this would ever happen unless out of defense of their natural rights. I give them credit where it is due, they could easily have done much more than they did, but we stepped in and told them not to. <P>I like the tangents we slide off to about investment in Israel. It all boils down to the same impotent idea. That economically prosperous people always mistreat people who are not economically prosperous. That for some reason simply because Israel has more money than the people in the palestinian occupied territories that they for some reason are the reason that the palestinians are destitute, poor, ill fed, etc.<P>To understand that you have to move to a discussion of Africa, a series of countries where most people are poor and there are even greater civil wars. The only difference is we have no investment in the area and so therefore do about nothing to solve the problems of that area. The people there are not poor directly as a result of some rich country misusing some poor country, it is because warlords steal from the people, misuse their trust, steal aid sent to the area and use it to fund their civil wars. You know what I think, and maybe I am just out there, but I think that the reason the palestinians are poor and destitute is not because the Israeli's go out of their way to cause it, but because maybe a dictator is chosing to misuse and abuse his people in an effort to promote a goal which is much similar to the africa goal which is an attempt to kill a group of people whom they do not simply like.<P>I know you hate how I don't throw out some political solution here for you all to be amazed at. But I like studying history and in history, no problem like this has ever been solved by appeasing murderers. Some day a palestinian state may be there and maybe it should, but you can't do it under these circumstances.<P>--andrew

k, u all dont know me or anything but still ill post here.<P>what i think might be a bit 1 sides since i am an israeli and live in israel.<P>im sorry to tell you all, but i cant see how there is going to be any peace between us ( israel ) and palastin, for 1 simple reason.<P>in my opinion, israel gave yasser arafat every chance in the world to stop all this killing... and yet it was turned down. even ( as sukar said ), ehud barak ( the prime minister of israel at the time ) offer'd to yassar arafat almost EVERYTHING he asked for it was turned down....<P>another thing is, most of u may or may not know some of the thing's that is going on in here, before the militery action israel took in jenin there were about 2 or 3 suicide bombings in israel every week, and somtimes ( although rarly ) 2 a day...<P>im talking from a point of view most of israel cevilian's have atm, there simply CANT be peace between israel and palastin as long as suicide bombing kidnapping( or attempt's i should say ) of israeli soldier's and civilian's... arafat said many times that he is doing his best to stop the terrorist act's, but as everyone could of seen nothing was changed...<P>as a metter of fact just yesterday there was a suicide bombing near tel aviv ( rishon le zion but u wont know it im sure hehe :P ), in that suicide bombing alone 15 people died and 55 people injured, 1 is about to die from her injuries and 3 are injured badly....<P>just my small opinion just had to respond<P>Xwar 60 war<BR>proud member of VoLS

Wow! Too bad I never visited the DROW forums before this. Definetely some interesting and intelligent (for the most part) discussions going on here. <P>As for my opinion on the middle east situation:<P>(After I finished writing this I realized it is very long, but action packed, so try at least to read it all.)<P>Israel has been justified in everything they have done since 1948. They have done everything correctly since 1948 EXCEPT for allowing international pressure to hinder their self defense measures. If you sat at a desk, for 54 years, and on some days had one kid throwing a ball at your head, on other days several kids doing it, would you not just take the ball away? Or even more, throw the ball back... real hard? Sure you would. If the teacher in the class let the ball throwing at your head slide by, and then criticized you strongly every time you took the ball away would you give a damn? You bet not, you'd do whatever you could in your self defense. Furthermore, if the teacher did this, would you not suspect the teacher had a hidden agenda... or at least something against you? I know I would. Granted now, this is an oversimplification of a very complex issue, but the analogy holds. <P>For 54 years, Israel, the only home of the Jews has been struggling with ball throwers, and prejudice teachers. Would you stand by and let your daughter or son, or mother, or father, get blown up? Would you not flinch if the Smiths who lived next door for 10 years were one day all wiped off the face of the earth? Or maybe the Johnson family was at a Johnson family reunion, and the hall they rented out was blasted to bits. Good-bye Johnsons! I don't think anyone could say they would stand by.<P>Although it has become cliche these days to say oh.. occupation, yes BUT... occupation, occupation, occupation, occupation! God damnit, Im tired as hell hearing about occupation. First of all, I could present you with a list of over 50 MAJOR terrorist attacks PRE-1967 (yep got that list saved on my computer). Furthermore, as most of you are Americans, I will take the story home. Do you call, Florida, or California "Occupied territories"? Like hell you do! However, on some day in the distant history the U.S. annexed these terrirtories from the Spanish. That's right, they took it with bloodshed, for no real cause other than to expand their borders. You don't hear Mexicans demanding "right of return", they don't cry "Oh woe, my great great great great great etc. Grandfather's home was knocked over and burned by American troops, and I want the land back." <P>In 1967 the Arabs fucked up and attacked Israel after they had failed in all prior attempts. How bloody arogant they are to demand territory back that they lost when THEY attacked Israel. The worst part is that people actually support this shit. Not to mention the fact that in 1948 every one of the Arabs living in Israel was offered full citizenship. Would have been better off if you ask me. The right to vote, a good economy, democracy... <P>Someone said it before, Islamic fundamentalists (terrorists) would love to see all of the non-Muslims wiped off the face of the earth. I'm starting to get the sense that more and more, the feeling is mutual. Everyone knows many Arab children learn in school and through textbooks to hate Jews, what most don't know, is that it's not just Jews.. Mr. Christian, you're next, Smiling Buddhist? You're outta here. We already know the Arabs hate Hindus... Pakistan and Arabia Vs. India Round 2. <P>For a long time most Israelis (Jewish or not) and most Jews always thought only of the olive branch. Make peace they said, give them a chance, we will have peace in the land of Israel. Lately, that sentiment is diminishing. I personally have almost exhausted my naive faith that somehow peace will be achieved. How many chances do you give the man who, every summer, runs up to your home and stomps down your flowers? You tell him every year to stop, but every year he is back... with bigger boots... killing more flowers. The time for the Arabs is up.. and I say Arabs and not Palestinians, because for the most part they are in it together. Yes, I sound racist, I'm not going to deny it. You loose family members to suicide bombers, and then hear about all the people who cheer the bombers on, and who support the bombers with cash, and try and fucking not be a racist. I have ONE Muslim friend. Fortunately she agrees with me on the Mid-East issues, and that is why she lives in Canada. I don't hate all Arabs, I am sure there are plenty of peaceknick Arabs out there, just not enough. <P>Pretty much since Muhamad died, the Arab culture has disented into an anarchistic, hedonistic, and corrupt society. It is sad, but true. Dictators live in palaces with gold lined walls (watch CNN videos of GWB meetings with Arab leaders) while their oppressed people live in shacks with walls lined with mold. The worst part is, the Arabs dont revolt against it. They revolt against American capitalism, or Israeli freedom. <P>I read a few interesting articles about Islam today. Seems Israel and the U.S. aren't the only victims... far from it. They are the only two nations that have press on it. The U.S. because it is the U.S. and Israel because it gets so much of it. The fact though is, that nearly every country in the world has at one time or another been the victim of Islamic terrorism. Are they rebelling against France's support of Israel? I would balk at that considering France's Anti-Semitic track record. Perhaps the Philipenes are being targeted for the billions they send Israel each year? Oh wait they don't, do the two countries even have formal relations? Perhaps it is the fact that the Philipenes are occupied territories, or ancestral Islamic territory? No on two counts. The second article I read brought to light another interesting fact. "The biggest victims of Islamic terorism are Arabs." Yep, poor Israel can no longer claim it is the biggest victim, how dare they as a matter of fact! We all know that More Arabs die each year to the hands of Arab terrorists. <P>When I visited Israel 4 years ago, before the intifada, I remember the ultimate goal for the nation at the time was re-planting of forests. Israel is the only country trying to teraform the land into what it once was before Arab colonization decimated it's forests. That's right, the Galilee and most of Israel was a lush paradise. So was a lot of the middle east. I remember standing on the hills overlooking a forest who's name I can not remember. It stood out like a sore thumb, and patriotic Canadian that I am, few forests in Canada could compare in beauty. Terrorism was out of my mind momentarily, all the Arabs who wanted to kill me and my family forget them. I was lost in the moment, I was awe struck, and frankly, travelling through the Holy land that was not the only time. Be you Christian or Jew, I'll bet you any money that if you land in Israel, the moment you disembark the plane you will feel something. An unparalelled feeling of familiarity. I have been here before was what the video records me as saying. The smell, so different from anywhere I had ever been, the air so thick with je ne sais quoi. <P>Now when I try and conjur up those feelings again, all I feel is anger. Anger knowing that millions of evil-doers would seek to undo what the Israelis of today have wrought. Anger, that I can not visit my ancestral home for fear of my life. Angry that the British, and the French, and a whole bunch of Europeans are so blinded by their hate, that they can not see what really goes on. When God said that the Israelites were his chosen people, I doubt this was what he had in mind. To be targeted by hatred for decades without number. For what reason? I will let Sushi answer, he is clearly anti-semitic. I would not for a moment hesitate to call him that. The fact that he calls that site he posted another view, or factual in any way is enough to make my mouth bitter. If every piece of "news" was not about some atrocity Israel comitted I might believe it was an online paper with a lot of bias... Clearly the junk the people on that site conjur up is without a drop of truth in the bucket. If Israel really has such a large spy network all over... everywhere, and is so talented at creating anthrax and deploying it, perhaps they could deploy some of their anthrax to the owners/operators of that site. <P>If anyone read about, or was at or saw the pro-Israel vs. Pro-Arab (Again I say Arab, because they are all in it together. Furthermore no such thing as "palestine" exists)rallies in Washington, or Ottawa, clear distinct differences could be found. If you were a deaf man at the Pro-Israel rallies you would have seen Israeli flags flown high, signs condeming Arafat, signs condeming terrorists, signs of Christian support groups, signs calling for.... peace. If you were a deaf man at the Pro-Arab rallies you would have seen Palestinian flags flown high, with Israeli flags burning, or being stomped on on the ground, you would have seen signs equating Zionism with racism, slanderous attacks at Jews, Christians, the U.S. and Israel/Israelis plastered all over boards in the air.  If you were a blind man at the Pro-Israel Rallies you would have heard impassioned speaches about suffering, death by terrorism, the need to root out evil, and bring the good Arabs to power, Israeli songs of harmony and support for Israel, speeches about how loss of life on either side is a loss, speeches about peace... If you were a blind man at a pro-Arab raid... er rally you would have heard chants of Death to Israel, Down with American capitalism, speeches about Israel being a terrorist state, speeches about how America is a corrupt country with a terrorist government, speeches about war...<BR>Anyone who says otherwise is a liar, I was there, I saw it, I heard it I am neither blind nor-deaf. <P>You can drive from anywhere in Israel to any other place in Israel in one day. It would take you a whole lot longer to travel in a straight line from the southmost border of Arabia, to the Northmost, in a straight line no less. I'd wager (and don't quote me, because it is only a guess and is not backed up by fact, only observation) that if you took all of the 53 Arab nations and combined them into one, you would have a land mass, comparable, or larger than the U.S. with plenty of room for 2.5 million Arabs with "no place to go". There is your solution. If these other Arab nations really "care" so much for the "victims of Israeli oppression" perhaps they would be so malevolent as to take these poor suffering souls under their wing. There are a plenty of dictatorships in the middle-east with governments just as corrupt as the one Arafat tries to lead, why do we need another one just like it?<P>Edit: I forgot to thank Xwar for his post. Who knows it better than someone who experiences it first hand?<p>[ May 08, 2002: Message edited by: Alistriwen ]

All of your posts are good, but they all get side tracked by devolving into the old "who is right and who is wrong" in the matter, which in all honesty, is irrelevant here.  Not only is it irrelevant, but debating it really gets us nowhere nearer to a solution, and oh what a debate it is.  As a minor example of how your comments as to Israel always being in the right could be debated, how about these counter arguments?  For example, just because our forefathers colonized the USA by killing Indians and Spaniards, does that mean in this day and age we are required to tacitly agree with any colonization going on in the world or be hypocrites?  My answer to that is no.  Further, any reference to colonization in general is a bad one, because that, by default, gives instant legitimacy and justification to resistance on the part of those being colonized.  Further, while yes, other Arab lands could serve to house the Palestinians, isn't Jerusalem and the land adjacent to it of special holy significance not only to Jews and Christians, but to Arabs too?  Why did the Jews settle on this land after all, if not for its historical and holy significance?  Yet the Palestinians are to be given a desert patch in Iran somewhere and that is that?  Further, Israel has to understand that so long as the world is as dependent upon the Arabs for their oil, the world will never allow Israel to unilaterally go about destabilizing the region further in its own self defense.  <P>The point is, who is right and who is wrong is not nearly as cut and dried as some of you, especially the Israelis posting here, would believe.  From your perspective, Israel is completely in the right, and thus anyone who disagrees in Britain or France or wherever, must do so because they must be anti-semitic.  I think this is wrong.  While yes, there are anti-semites out there, my personal belief is that a lot of folks out there don't hate Jews at all, they just feel like here is this powerful country (Israel) suppressing these weak Palestinians by occupying their territory, who have no way to defend themselves and thus have turned to the lunacy of suicide bombs.  You all think these people are wrong for thinking this way, and generally I would agree with you, but I think that it is wrong of you to brand these people anti-semites for thinking this way.  To me there is a clear distinction between hating Jews in general and disagreeing with Israel's current policy with regard to the occupied territories.  In my opinion, using the "anti-semite" card to try and shush opinions on the Middle Eastern conflict that differ from your own, is a cheap way out.<P>Oh, and to reaffirm my personal stake in the matter, while you Israelis suffer from this conflict every day, do understand that I myself have been affected as well, losing a very close friend in 9/11 and dealing with that daily anxiety of living near the Pentagon (i.e., American target A) and riding subways in D.C. (i.e., American biological target B).  I myself could have been one of the casualties, since two years before 9/11 I submitted a resume to Lehman Brothers for a job in the WTC.  Thankfully (in retrospect), they had no available positions.<P>Regardless, who is right and wrong is not only vague, it gets us nowhere.  Like I said at the beginning, the point here is not to figure out who is right or wrong, it is how to solve this conflict in a fair way without rewarding terrorism.  I remain thinking my solution is a good one, and welcome comments on it, or other plausible solutions.  Given the oil factor, the world will never agree to allow Israel free license to do as it wishes to "defend itself" in the Middle East, so that solution - the one where the world turns the other cheek and allows Israel to wreck havoc on the Arabs - is not a plausible one.  <P>However, I agree with you all in the sense that this is going to have to be settled by violence upon the Arabs.  But this should be done at the direction of the world itself, not Israel.  It should be violence that is triggered by the Arabs themselves after they are given a fair solution and a fair chance for peace.  Review my solution for further details.<p>[ May 09, 2002: Message edited by: Lizard ]<P>--------------------<P>Scaled, for her pleasure<BR><A HREF="http://drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Sssorn" TARGET=_blank>Profile</A> | <A HREF="http://www.drow.org/news.shtml" TARGET=_blank>BotS</A>

Not exactly "on topic," but required reading for anyone with even a passing interest in this whole situation.<P>It's an opinion piece based on facts, rather than a presumed factual pieces based on half-truths and misconceptions that we see so often.
