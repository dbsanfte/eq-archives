<b>IN THE BEGINNING...</b>
<br>

...there was netquake. It was a slow game but a pioneer of sorts for online gaming. Never before was
it possible to join and leave games on the fly. Never before was it possible over a modem to play
against multiple other players. As is true of anywhere, there developed the idea of teams and order
within the game, and soon came the clans.

<p>
The members of 'Clan Drow' were all local to Cincinnati as a great ISP called <A
href="http://www.one.net">OneNet Communications</a> had placed
servers up for the public. Soon several of the better players began to operate as a team, and the
Clan was born. Unable to get out onto the 'net' from OneNet for netquake play, they quickly
dominated these local servers and tried to encourage other players to band together to play against
them with limited results. 
<p>
With the advent of a good solid QuakeWorld client, Clan Drow streched out of it's own servers and
started to play against other Clans. They were good, but hadn't had the practice with organized
players that the other groups had had, and consequently suffered limited success. The Clan also grew
tired of Capture the Flag and moved into Team Deathmatch as more of a specialization. Here they found
more of a nitch and attracted several good players who were not local to Cincinnati. But Quake was
getting old. 
<p>
Ultima Online became the interest of many of the core members as Clan Drow turned into Guild Drow.
When the Catskills server was placed online, the Guild migrated to there and started playing. Picking
up several more members, they now play on both sides of the PK fence. 
<p>
Recently however, there has been a great deal of interest in a new game by Sony Entertainment called
EverQuest With the growing interest in this game, it is becoming obvious that soon it will be
<i>the</i>
game to beat. For that reason, 'The Drow' have decided to take the clan/guild organization to their
next logical level, the Organization. Organization Drow will be more concerned with the domination of
all games played on the net, an organized effort to work together across the boundaries of games to
give all players in the Organization a brotherhood of people with whom to play.
