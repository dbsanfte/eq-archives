AL down. Only 1 death. I shouldn't mention 1 death though because Verant will go ahead and upgrade him again for the 23,438th time thinking the encounter is 'too' easy. A big <b>FUCK YOU</b> goes out to Verant. You know, the people charging us more a month, for the same shitty service that always breaks something when a new patch is implemented. A million other reasons to hate this company but I won't mention them since it is a waste of my energy typing it. Thank god for Shadowbane, now hurry the fuck up and get past beta.<BR><BR>

<img src="eq/adastuff/adatunare.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="10" border=1>BotS was pretty busy this weekend, going back and forth through zones, taking down 'uber' mobs. I guess my best way to put it would be as if I'm on a tour bus with like 40 of my friends and stop at every town to beat the shit out of some random person on the road and take his valuables. I dunno if that sounds like fun, but its kinda late and that was the only thing I could think of. Tunare, Dain, Burrower, Creator, and CT are all locked up in the 7-day penalty box. We also had some fun with High Priest v.5.443. We learned a lot and you can see a <a href="cgi-bin/ss.cgi?t=1?ss=/eq/adastuff/hpfun.jpg">pic</a> of us handling his guards. Believe it or not, we survived that battle. Was one of the funnest fights I had in awhile.<BR><BR>
Vulak RoF was completed by us on Thursday. Went through all of the waves then BAM! Nothing. Not a damn thing happened. If I wanted blue balls I would have gone to Amanda's house and dry humped for about an hour, but I try to avoid BB since its a shitty feeling. But in the case, "Vulak RoF is working". Lies.<BR><BR>
Since I am willing to spew the loot on one mob, I'll let you guys speck the burrower.

Vegas raid was exactly everything we needed. Some of the troops landed on Tuesday to start off the fireworks. The rest of the backup arrived on Wednesday and Thursday. This was an absolutely awesome week/weekend and I want to thank everyone for great memories. We had ~25 or so people who met up and partied like it was 1999.

Just when we thought we had him again, Verant's 56k host had ~20 second hiccup on us which ended up killing quite a few of our melee's. Lots of clam in /gu, but that's normal when you fail at a 1 time shot every 5 days. I won't go into detail but we lost to him when he was at 5%. Pretty shitty feeling. Other news, Tunare dead along with AL and Creator. We will be trying High Priest 3.0.4b this weekend if we have enough online just for all of you who REALLY needed to know.<BR><BR>
What do you get when a nosey GM pokes around in NTOV when BotS are raiding there? I'll give you a hint, starts with an 'T'.. ends with a 'rain'. Ahh correct. a TRAIN. My first experience of a GM training Ring of Vulak, then dying of his own stupidity. I don't think he was too happy of himself either after the res. I was asking him politely how he prounounced his name, but he RUDELY ignored me! What a poop-dick.<BR><BR>

As I'm thinking to myself, "Why the hell am I updating the site right now", I came to realize that people can become REALLY bored without even knowing and get in a wierd mood. I'm sure its happened to a few of you, YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE. Well, first off BotS went down to TOV North to see how the changes were. Some were quite ridiculous and some encounters were made fun. Cekenars hp is 4x as much and he still drops booty ass loot except for the Blackstar. The more and more I do NTOV, it seems as though more items go to our kayans instead of alts. I'm guessing since we have cleared that place like what..oh..33 or so times. Gets tedius sometimes. I'm just ranting away since I'm not tired yet. So what's up? Oh yea, like to make a shout out to SOT for letting us fool around in North for an additional day. What else..well, AoW went down on Satruday. He can be such a bitch sometimes, but my favorite part in doing AoW, is the <a href="cgi-bin/ss.cgi?t=1?ss=/eq/fun/niceropeaow.jpg">"rope"</a> comments after Docs takes his death like a trooper!

<h3>High Priest goes on a RAMPAGE, only hurts himself in the process.</h3>
<center><img src="eq/sshrae/020902-hpbanner.jpg" border=0></div></center><BR>
Our demoralized band of ruckus decided to give the High Priest one more go last night since all of us were tired and tired of getting beat down by this fucker. I think all of us agreed that he had to pay the price for pissing us off. If you read the banner, then yes, you read right, we had absolutely no deaths on the last try. <b>ZERO, ZIP, NADDA, NONE.</b><BR><BR>
I'm almost positive I'm going to hear, "No way they could do that against the HP unless they were 'sploitin" or something in that context. Well I guess you don't know BotS, you monkeys. Perfect strat + perfect execution == <a href="cgi-bin/ss.cgi?t=1?ss=/eq/sshrae/020902-hpdead.jpg">perfectly dead HP.</a> So please, less hating.<BR><BR>
Through the years of achievements BotS has obtained I really do think this kill is one of our Top 5 Greatest Beat-Downs. Everyone's execution was beyond perfect and to tell you the truth if I'm going to single out a class, I don't think we could have done it without our mages. Tomrrow I'm going to buy me a midget that will follow me around and drop Mod Rods v.2 on the ground everywhere I go. Would I use the rods? Probably not, but I think it would be cool to have some midget following me around.<BR><BR>

Making this update pretty damn quick because I just took some flu medicine and I'm falling asleep at the keyboard as we speak :) As some of you know from my other update I just replaced, BotS have taken down Creator/AoW/Tunare this week. For the 'new' news, Arch Lich Rhag`Homosexuality was taken down for the first time for BotS. His loot was <a href="javascript:doloot('/eq/loot/ringofsuperiorhealth.jpg')">Clerics-Get-The-Shaft-Again Ring</a> for <a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Khevral">Khevral</a> and a <a href="javascript:doloot('/eq/loot/tendonslicer.jpg')">crap peircer</a> for Target. I promise more on the next update and maybe I might be clever enough to make something worthwhile to read again.<BR><BR>

<img src="eq/aow/012002-aowdead.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="10" border=1>This weekend was crazy silly with 2 server-firsts and a beat-down in Sshrae's. The Avatar of War went down today and his ass-beating self got a taste of his own medicine when BotS gathered to take him down. At the start we kinda fucked up on the pull so we got off on a shaky start, but we ended up pissing off the Sinbad look-alike halfway through cause he knew we had the best of him. <a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Tikkon">Tikkon</a> was awarded the <a href="javascript:doloot('/eq/loot/flayedbarbarianhidemask.jpg')">mask,</a> <a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Mistabone">Mistabone</a> and <a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Ootampa">Ootampa</a> on the <a href="javascript:doloot('/eq/loot/ringofdestruction.jpg')">rings.</a><BR><BR>
BotS scheduled the raping of Tunare on Saturday, but perhaps I shouldn't use the word 'raping' since you cannot rape the willing. Ever since Tankish became a jigilow he's had more money than me, so he had first dibs. Put your back into it Tank! <a href="javascript:doloot('/eq/loot/petrifiedheartwoodflamberge.jpg')">Petrified heartwood Flamberge</a> to <a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Sukar">Sukar,</a> <a href="javascript:doloot('/eq/loot/fistofnature.jpg')">Fist of Nature</a> to <a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Sssorn">Sssorn</a> and a <a href="javascript:doloot('/eq/loot/sapencrustedbranch.jpg')">Sap Encrusted Branch</a> for <a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Garreth">Garreth</a> and <a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Nadart">Nadart.</a><BR><BR>

<img src="eq/sshrae/011902-creatorloot.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="10" border=1>During this busy weekend we also had time to take down Xerkizh the Creator. Even though he's probably THE buggiest EQ mob in game with his 'I-have-90-arms-helicopter-rampage' manuever, he was still taken down. It also didn't help that he was duel wielding <a href="javascript:doloot('/eq/loot/glowingmithrilulak.jpg')">these</a> either. Thank god he dropped monk loot since we are really short on MNK/BST loot! We didn't have enough time for the HP, but expect him dead when we fit him in our schedule.<BR><BR>
<div align=center><img src="eq/sshrae/011902-creator.jpg" border=1></div><BR><BR>
I'd also like to take this time to thank a local guild on the Rathe, <a href='http://www.tindilosi.com'>Tindi` Losi.</a> Without their help on coordinating their Statue kill in order for us to try the AoW, we would have never took him down. Thanks TL!

<h3>ADAIREN AFK???!</h3>
Damn, what a week. Dunno where to start so I guess I will list from what is on the top of my mind to the petty shit others could care less about. Many of us are pretty excited for the upcoming AoW attempts for the sole reason of which I don't have to list. If you are lost then --> scroll down to Jan. 12 update!<BR><BR>

<img src="eq/fun/tankishaxe.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="10" border=1>During late last week we had a Ring of Fire raid. It went pretty well, and we killed up to wave 6. Flagrant Warmaster I think his name was. Honestly, I'm just guessing his name from the <a href="javascript:doloot('/eq/loot/axeofthewarmaster.jpg')">loot</a> we got because all I get to do during that fight is stare at a freakin wall.<br><BR>
Vulak, our favorite sugar daddy loot-cow(tm), decided to drop for the 31st time last night. Loot consisted of <a href="javascript:doloot('/eq/loot/dovassirsgauntletsofmight.jpg')">Do`Vassir's Gauntlets of Might</a> which went to <a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Casar">Casar</a>, <a href="javascript:doloot('/eq/loot/palladiusaxeofslaughter.jpg')">Palladius's Axe</a> to <a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Ootampa">Ootampa</a>, and Ranger sword to Davood's kayan. Still only one robe out of 91 Vulak loots; pretty bootylicious if you ask me.<BR><BR>
During my time as a cleric I have to pay attention to guildchat during fights. Who's healing who, who's buffing who, who's ressing who, etc.. Well not only do I get enough /cyber spam and /gu spam as it is, I have to put up with retarded critical hit and lifetap spam now. Gets kinda hard to read stuff when every melee class in the game can now critical hit and ALL at the same time. So I ask you people who read this site, to simply help us all out and /feedback something about having a Critical Hit filter and Lifetap filter put in. Would be MUCHOS appreciated. Here's a <a href='eq/adastuff/feedback.shtml'>link</a> of a few that I've input so far, feel free to send me <a href='mailto:adairen37@hotmail.com'>yours.</a><BR><BR>

<h3>DAOC</h3>
After 3 months since release of Dark Age of Camelot, I would like to give you all some info on how the team is doing.<BR><BR>
Steady leveling, has put GUILD DROW into a position of promise on the Morgan Le Fay server, which is one of the 3 most populated servers in all of DAOC. We have gotten rid of most of the lamers, guild hoppers, and non powergamers, and have pretty much settled into our core group of players who will be leading this team to the usual DROW greatness.<BR><BR>
We have taken forts (solo) along with our alliance partners <a href="http://www.blushn.com/mod/">MOD</a>, we our 4th golobally in rankings on our server in rp's, and guess what, WE HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED TO PVP FULL TIME YET.<BR><BR>
Our first level 50 character was reached yesterday LANNWEN, congrats to you bro. We have a total of about 50 solid players atm with 90% being 40+ and 50% being 45+. As DAOC is still in its infancy, you can look forward to DROW pretty much owning the Morgan Le Fay server in the coming months which is nothing but typical of a DROW.<BR><BR>
Upcoming patches in the next few weeks will make DAOC an even greater game than it is now, and DROW plans on having a long term prescence in the game. If you plan on playing DAOC and want to play with the one of the best and most respected guilds, please head on over to the <a href="http://www.drow.org/forums/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi">forums</a> and let us know your intentions.

<h3>EQ: VI only hires the best!</h3>
Today was quite odd. To start off, Verant tells us that Mark of Retribution is working as intended. Well, it turned out that MoR was bugged and was providing 228pts of dmg shield that stacked with all other damage shields. Not only that, but when used a certain way, it could crash a zone. So we get end up getting this message...<br><br>

The past few days have been more exploring. Got a couple more items from RoF but I never got the SS. p0 you. We also made a trip down to Akheva to try out the upgraded Itraer. Yea this guy is so much fun, I really can't contain myself writing this. Click the pic to see the video of us battling him out.<BR><BR>

<h3>DROW QuakeWorld Servers offline...</h3>
<br>
I'm sorry to announce that I had to shut off our QW servers. They'll remain down until I find a new home for them.<br>
<br>
The servers were graciously being hosted by the company I work for. However, since I'm changing jobs, I'm no longer able to host them there.<br>
<br>
Thanks to all of you hardcore <a href="http://www.quakeworld.net/">QuakeWorld</a> players who always kept the DROW servers full. A big <b>FUCK YOU</b> to cheaters who have caused me to in effect ban innocent people who use the same ISP as you over the years. Get a life.<br>

<h3>Ok so I lied...</h3>
Was hoping to provide you with a full update but lets face it, I'm busy just like you getting AA points.<br><br>
Luclin has been very promising and has some very nice content, but Verant needs some fucking originality. VI Xerox Department gets an A+ in my book for replication. Sshrae snakes for example, were in UO's first expansion pack. Which I would like to mention ALWAYS kicked my ass cause of server-lag and since monsters were server-side, they didn't lag at all. JJ. Second, lay off the Final Fantasy Series. Notice a resemblance?<br><BR>
<div align=center><img src="eq/fun/auronripoff.jpg"></div><br>
Get some creativity please! If you want to continue to copy other people's ideas, then I <b>DEMAND</b> that a 'LaBlue Girl' zone be put in and a 'Save Gary Coleman' quest be implimented ASAP.<BR><BR>
I'd like to take this time to rant a bit more about the Cleric class. Fuck you Verant for not giving us a self-invis. I'm just giddy as a school girl carrying around 4 million invis pots around everywhere I go. And don't say, "well, ada, you have larrikan mask ~~la".<BR><BR>
Take your fucking ~~la and piss off. How would making clerics have self-invis imbalance the game? It can't and it won't, but Verant is just too damn lazy to code it in. Speaking of lazy, put a freakin CRITICAL HIT filter in. For the love of god, we already bought a gig of RAM to run this game smoothly, just for YOU!, at least put a life tap and crit filter in for 'us'.<BR><BR>
On a lighter note, I'm very glad to say that I was wise on how I spent some of my points.<br><br>
<div align=center><img src="eq/fun/critheal.jpg"></div><br>
Like 10k wasnt enough...<BR><BR>
Well enough of my rants and to sum of the week, we cleared NTOV again 2x, and some other shit. If you REALLY REALLY wanna know what we have done to the PRECISE detail, then click <a href="/eq/fun/nosy.shtml">me.</a><BR><BR>
