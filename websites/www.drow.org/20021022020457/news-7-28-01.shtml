For the first time <b>anywhere</b> since the upgrade, Ventani, the fourth warder in Sleeper's Tomb, has been killed by Blood of the Spider.  Time of Death: 10:50 PM EST, Monday, July 30, 2001.  Congratulations to everyone involved.<br>
<br>
I'd like to take a quick moment to thank Sssorn and Ketsui (edit: guild names removed to squelch the whining of the ignorant) for joining us to help us develop the strategy we used to kill Ventani.<br>
<br>
<b>[Edit:</b> People seem to be stupid enough to think that a) Sssorn and Ketsui developed the entire strategy and/or b) We used a similar "exploit" that Conquest used to defeat Ventani.  Neither is true.  The entire guild contributed to the development and execution of the strategy, and at no point was an exploit used, as I've explained below.  People are beginning to think that <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=5858.topic&index=16">this</a> is the strategy we're using to <b>defeat Kerafyrm</b>.  Stupid or dense?  You decide.]<br>
<br>
Lots of people have asked if we're going to get banned now.  Thankfully not.  Several GMs sent us congratulations, and some said how proud they were that it happened on their server.<br>
<br>
What happened after Kerafyrm was released was complete chaos.  The first place we're sure he was spotted was in Skyshrine, where he subsequently went around killing everyone in the zone.  After that, rumors poured in about where he was, and honestly we can't be sure where he went.  I've been told that he went everywhere from Great Divide (I have no idea why), to Wakening Lands, to Western Wastes, and lots of other zones.  I'm sure I speak for my guild when I say it was easily the most entertaining time we've ever had playing the game.<br>
<br>
Thank you all for the praise we've been receiving, it means a lot to us to hear that kind of thing from people from all over the game.<br>
<br>
<a href="eq/july/july30.shtml">Screenshots?</a>  Yeah, we've got <a href="eq/july/july30.shtml">screenshots</a> - over 40 of them.  Thanks also to Vespid for <a href="http://eqshots.50megs.com/">mirroring</a> the screenshots, so check the mirror if drow.org's loading slowly.</a>

On the night of the last update, CT was up because of the patch so we cleared the Plane early and headed toward Cazic.  Loot was ass like always - halo for Laddy and cloak for Jagganath.
<br>

<br>
Following a very simple day was a very long day, a day where we just couldn't stop ourselves apparently.  The poosae version of Dain, our third in a row, died first for Xeonz's new belt.  Following him was Yelinak.  gloves for Ploogie, robe for Mentin, melee earring for Nadart, ring for Daach, and a Sleeper's Tomb key for Sparhawkk.
<br>

<br>
From Dain and Yelinak we moved on to Sleeper's Tomb to kill off the first three warders since they were up after the patch.  Nanzata had a mask for Crimsonghost, a red resistance stone for Adairen, and a large amount of rots.  Tukaarak had <b>four</b> Dainty Gloves, one pair went to Kelton and the other 3 rotted.  Shaynx got a primal spear, and Jhana got a blue resistance stone.  Hraashna had two more Sceptres of Destruction for Mistabone and Khevral, a Primal Axe for Sparhawkk, and a Primal Bow for Garrm.  I'm sure there were rots from him too, lances I think.
<br>

<br>
And yesterday we headed back to ToV North to kill Ikatiar and Eashen again.  Eashen had two Masks, one for Khevral and one for Blaal.  Ik's loot sucked, so who cares?  We'll be pushing forward in ToVN in the coming weeks.
<br>

<br>
No screenshots today kiddies, you've seen all I have to offer.  You'll have to settle for <a href="eq/july/july28.shtml">the loot</a>.

<span class="news">
Starting from the day after the last update, we killed Yelinak.  Gloves went to Lyly and Sleeper's key to Veness.  We ended the night with ToV armor farming.  To date, number of (now useless) chain tunics since the last plate breastplate: <b>three</b>.
<br>

<br>
Zlandicar died again sometime during the week so we could get a Sleeper's key (the bane of our Necromancers lately) for Xenitabra.  Stick around a while, won't you?
<br>

<br>
What good are Sleeper's keys if you don't go to Sleeper's Tomb, right?  We skipped MotG and Prog along with the ~100 sentries and 10 gargs that just aren't worth killing and moved right to the FA.  We probably wouldn't have bothered with him either had he not been directly in the way of the warders.  We popped Nanzata, Tukaarak and Hraashna in rapid succession and made several attempts on Ventani, which you can probably guess, didn't end well.  Failed attempts aside, loot was pretty good from the first three.  Three primal warswords, two sceptres, two gnome masks, a white resist stone and dainty gloves, along with a few stupid loots like primal two handers and Smolders.  Oh, and Primal Avatar ended up rotting; perhaps if more than our Shamans would come to Sleeper's...
<br>

<br>
At this point Dain had come out from hiding after the server downage, and he was the poosae 350 version if I recall correctly.  Short story shorter, Khevral got a new belt.  We moved to Temple of Veeshan since it seemed like the place to be that night (160 people) and moved through the overly-camped hub into the north wing to kill Ikatiar and get a few Eashen attempts in.  From Ikatiar, boots for Xenitabra and a cloak for Sariden.
<br>

<br>
Determined to kill Eashen, we came back the next day and killed him.  Rathe-first #1 of this week.  Ring of the Sky to Mistabone and Bracer of the Sky to Finris.
<br>

<br>
Still looking for more "firsts" to kill, we came back to ToV the next day.  Gozzrem died (shovel, wand), as did Telkorenar (crown, paly sword) because we wanted their cubbies.  We then moved towards Lendiniara the Keeper.  On the first pull and first attempt of the night, we killed him/her/it for some pretty nice loot, along with another Sleeper's talisman.  Gromm received Gloves of Stability, Ozzyd got a Mask of Superiority, Elfian got a ranger-only ring whose name I won't even try to spell, and Trivilus got his Sleeper's key.  Rathe-first #2 of this week.

Pretty basic news update today, since no one recorded what we did and anything here will be coming off of the memory of just a couple of people.
<br>

<br>
Lyly won the Cleric Best of the Best on the Rathe, and our own Adairen took second (Vaylin broadcasted this for some reason).
<br>

<br>

<br>
We killed Dain once again for a belt for Crimsonghost.  Vindi's no longer needed really, he's just in the way of our Statue killings, which now drops us a faction level every kill, but no matter - he died twice anyway.  The first loot was so/so (Reaver, Cloak, Breastplate), but the second loot, well, see for yourself:
<br>

<br>
<center><img src="eq/statue/071701-StatueLoot.jpg"></center>
<br>

<br>
Breastplates went to Sukar, Ootampa and Ploogie, the scroll went to Noel, the Cloak to Khyck, and no one gives a damn about the Reaver.
<br>

<br>
We haven't killed Yelinak since the last update because of a certain issue with our Wizards being "gone," but expect another killing when they get back.  Other than that we've been pretty busy farming ToV, upgrading everyone's armor and starting to push toward ToV North.  We killed the first of the North mobs, Ikatiar the Venom for some new sleeves for Emil and a Cloak for Xenitabra.
<br>

<br>
At some point in the last few days we made another trip to Sleepers, where we killed the first three Warders again, and made a pretty good attempt on Ventani, the fourth.  No cloth caps this time, but we got 4 primal axes between the first two warders.  Lots of new loot dropped tonight - Primal Battlehammer for Emil, Primal Spear for Gromm, Clawed Guardian Bracers for Aegeis and Emil, and a Writ of Dragonkind which I don't think anyone bothered taking with the intent of using it.

I figured I'd try something new and opt for more frequent updates with fewer (if any) screenshots over one gigantic update per week, or so.  So, with that out of the way...
<br>

<br>
We killed Klandicar for a key for Pestilense and then moved into Dragon Necropolis to kill Zlandicar, and got a Sleeper's key for Adairen, among Zlandicar's other crap loot.  Since we were already near WW, we moved to Temple of Veeshan to kill Telkorenar (Breastplate --> Caylista, Eyepatch --> Valdiin) and lost to Gozzrem due to a few (like 4) linkdead wizards.  Gotta love that zone.  At this point I went to sleep, but I think we killed the wussier, popped Trakanon to finish Qualtz's epic.

Ok, so I lied about updating the last one with pictures of two dead warders.  But this update will make up for it.  Not only did we go back and kill the first two warders again after the server patch, but we also stuck it to that nasty third warder, Hraashna.  And this time, you <b>will</b> get screenshots.  But first, ever wonder what a warder corpse looks like when you loot it?
<br>

<br>
<center><img src="eq/sleepers/corpses/070501-nanzata1_loot.jpg"><img src="eq/sleepers/corpses/070501-nanzata2_loot.jpg"><img src="eq/sleepers/corpses/070501-tukaarak2_loot.jpg"><img src="eq/sleepers/corpses/070501-hraashna_loot.jpg"></center>
<br>

<br>
Yes, we got three cloth caps from three warders, and yes, it sucks - but the rest was pretty good.  I'm kind of partial to Hraashna's three Primal War Swords, Sceptre of 12/18 ownage and +35 MR in range stone.  The second Nanzata had 2 primal bows (one was ninja'd before I got the shot), another smolder, a nice caster mask, and a primal warsword.  The Tukaarak loot pictured (I didn't get a loot shot from the first one) had another Gnome mask, three +35 CR in range stones, and a stupid 4/12 caster staff.
<br>

<br>
Aside from killing three warders, there was a patch, so we also killed Dain, Yelinak, Vindi, Statue and Cazic.  Nothing great dropped from any of them.

What could possibly call for a half-assed update at 1:30 in the morning on a Sunday, you ask?  Three words:
<br>

<br>
<center><a href="cgi-bin/ss.cgi?t=1?ss=/eq/misc/gnomes.jpg"><img src="eq/misc/gnomes_t.jpg" border=0></a><br><b>Fear the gnomes!</b> (Tikkon, Deciderius, Nekon)</center>
<br>

<br>
That's right - we went into Sleeper's Tomb tonight with the goal to kill at least the first two warders, as we were robbed of the kills last time.  And obviously, we succeeded in killing both Nanzata the Warder (Smolder, Primal Bow, Primal War Lance, Staff of the Elder Claws, Red Resistance Stone x2) and Tukaarak the Warder (Mask of Tinkering x3, Dainty Gloves x2, Primal Velium Brawl Stick).
<br>

<br>
Also, on the night of the last update we apparently decided that we just hadn't quite killed <i>enough</i> of Norrath in one single day, so we logged back on at 2:30, in the wee hours of the Eastern morning to find Klandicar up, whom we naturally killed.  But we couldn't stop there - we checked on Zlandicar to find that he was still in hiding, but that rat bastard Vaniki was up, so we offed him for a Nerfedsapper and called it a night.
<br>

<br>
I'm tired (read: lazy) right now, so I'll update with all the screenshots tomorrow.
