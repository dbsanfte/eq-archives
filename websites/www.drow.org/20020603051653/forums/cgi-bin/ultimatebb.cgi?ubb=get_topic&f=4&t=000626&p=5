I don't know if you were speaking about my post, but if you read the WHOLE thing, you will notice I did propose a resolution. VERY similar to the one in the article Hindenburg posted. The whole preface was to backup my ideas and to show the rest of my opinion, which is also what you asked for.<P>In response to your counterpoints. U.S. colonialism is very relevant. Of course what happened in Israel was not colonialism, it was spoils of a war they did not initiate. What the U.S. did and what Israel did, were both in the past, they both resulted in a people being "displaced" although Arabs in Israel were given the option to stay as legitimate citizens, and it gives no legitimacy to a "resistance" because how can you resist something you started?<P>As for Jerusalem. Jerusalem IS a holy site for all these religions very true. However, do you see any Christians coming and saying "It's our holy spot too, lets make a country near all of our holy sites." No you do not. Im sure if terror were to stop and peaceful relations existed between Israel and the Arab world, there would be no problem with Jews, Christians, and Arabs alike coming to visit their holy sites. There are many Buddhist sites in Afghanistan, does that give the Chinese a right to demand land in Afghanistan? (Most of these sites were demolished during the Taliban regime mind you. And if you've been to Bethlehem recently you'll know that most Christian holy sites have been demolished or desecrated as well.) Israel was given to the Jewish people because they NEEDED a state, and they needed one NOW. It could have been anywhere, granted, but seeing as it was a British colony the British did not want to manage anymore, and it was the historical home of the Jews, it seemed the logical place. Religious history or not, it was the best choice. <P>I agree 100% with the oil thing. Which is why I 100% support mining Alaska for oil. I think everyone would be better off if someone other than Arabs controlled the oil. As for Anti-Semitism, perhaps it is not the only driving factor behind European bias, but it's a big factor.  I think the disagreement with Israel's policies are founded in Anti-Semitism. Anyone who was not biased would be able to see that Israel is right. The reason lots of people who are NOT Anti-Semitic criticize Israel is because an Anti-Semitic press provides people with a basis for that criticism because their reporting is biased and wrong. <P>If you are at all interested in seeing where I get this information (all the varied sources) just put your email address here and I'll send you all of it.

"Anyone who was not biased would be able to see that Israel is right."<P>The point is, who cares really.  No one cares if Israel is right or wrong.  Know why?  Because so long as the world needs Arab oil, Israel's hands are going to be tied regardless how right or wrong Israel is.  Because the Arabs will continue to hate Israel regardless how right or wrong Israel is.<P>Time is both with Israel and against Israel.  As time passes, hopefully technology will liberate the world from the chains of oil.  Fuel cells, electricity powered engines, etc.  I personally think Bush and the U.S. govt could be doing a lot more toward hastening the introduction of such fuel alternatives into the main stream, but that is another matter.  Some day, when the technology is in place, and oil reserves start drying up in the Middle East from over production, the world won't care as much about the fate of the Arabs, and the leash on Israel to do as it wishes to defend itself will loosen.<P>On the other hand, as time passes, is there any doubt that Arabs will eventually secure some major biological and nuclear weaponry?  Israel is so tiny, and so exposed, that it could be destroyed and rendered unlivable by just one such attack.<P>The clock is ticking, and a solution is nowhere in sight as things are going.  America has to have the will to force a solution with the international community.  Sadly, collective will to make a sacrifice for a greater good is not one of the strengths of democracy.<P>--------------------<P>Scaled, for her pleasure<BR><A HREF="http://drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Sssorn" TARGET=_blank>Profile</A> | <A HREF="http://www.drow.org/news.shtml" TARGET=_blank>BotS</A>

Very scary truths about the biological weaponry. I know Israel has nuclear weapons, as a last resort of course. It must take great strength not to launch them each and every day. However, my point is, if the whole world took the right side, and decided to either take over, and destroy the corrupt Arab states, or take over and introduce democracy to the nations and try and create some sort of stable infrastructure there. These are the only two real and viable solutions. Unfortunately world society is so PC and war so frowned upon that it probably will never happen. I hate war, but I personally believe that if war is the only way, it is the only way, and right now it is the only way. If the Arab nations ever develop ICBMs (Inter-Continental Balistic Missiles) you don't know how fucked everyone else will be. Right now many arab nations HAVE nuclear bombs, or biological weapons, they just lack the means to deploy them across great distances. When Iraq gains that ability all hell WILL break loose. If 100 ICBMs are launched at the U.S. it's safe to assume more than half of them will hit their targets, especially if the U.S. had no knowledge of Iraqi advancements. The world needs to realize this and take action, Israel and the U.S. were the first to realize it. <P>Obviously the U.S. is biding it's time before it does something. They found evidence linking Arafat inextricably to the suicide bombings, but nothing was done. Clearly they are waiting for something, perhaps it is solidarity with the rest of the civilized world, perhaps something else, who knows? The only solution is to stop the problem, that is the Arabs...

Not to belabor the issue more here since threads really shouldn't go this long, but here are some closing tidbits about the prospects for an international solution, as I have suggested (albeit a softer one, unlike mine):<BR>___________________________<BR>From The Economist May 4, 2002:<P>Israel and the outside world<BR><B>An international spectre over Sharon</B><BR>Jerusalem<BR><B>Although the government remains resolutely opposed to outside intervention, some Israelis are beginning to feel differently</B><P>....[T]he bugbear of internationalism is no longer regarded with universal Israeli terror.  A poll taken last week by Tel Aviv University showed that about half of those asked would welcome outside involvement in settling a conflict that the partners are plainly unable to settle by themselves.  More than one-third favoured the deployment of an armed international force, and a quarter said they supported the idea of a settlement imposed by the international community.<P>Internationalisation is still far from being an election-winner.  But one politician who believes it could be is Shlomo Ben Ami, who was foreign minister and Israel's chief negotiator under the Barak government.  Mr. Ben Ami's formula is for "internationally supervised disengagement".  Israel would withrdraw from 90% of the territories to a temporary border line.  The territories would be put under the control of an international body comprising America, the EU and NATO.  The temporary border would be policed by a multinational force, pending a final agreement along the lines of the one offered by Clinton after the collapse of the Camp David summit.  The international envelope, he argues, plus the international presence on the ground, would bring stability to the region.<P>Mr. Ben Ami is a lone voice, attacked from all points of the political compass.  But his response to the numerous critics is cogent: "Has your plan worked better?"<BR>_________________________<P>Now we are talking.

I spent some time this morning reading this lengthy thread. I did skim some of the more verbose postings, possibly missing some content. I think I got the gist of the postings, however.<P>I, personally, have only directly been in contact with Sssorn once. I was assisting BotS with the clearing of PoG. <He was a whole lot nicer than he'd come across on his EZboard posts.. Lol.> Anyway, I have disagreed with a lot of things that Sssorn has written. On this account, however, I believe with this post, he has shown himself to be a well-read, knowledgable person. This solution, while having some flaws to it, is the best thing I've ever seen suggested on the topic.<P>While Sssorn's suggestion of a solution led me to read the thread, it did not inspire me to post. What inspired me to post was the drivel of the leftist, liberal people on this thread. By leftist and liberal, I mean anyone that suggests coddling, and giving the benefit of the doubt to terrorists. <P>When Sept. 11th happened, I was dumbfounded. I was stunned, saddened, and fucking furious. I remain those things to this day. In the following days, I began to see a pulling together of our nation, and I was then excited. America for America was what I felt was the sentiment of the time. While lifting my heart, I knew it would only be a matter of time until the liberals started making this go away by questioning the way we reacted to these terrorist acts as a Nation. I was correct. Now, instead of supporting a full-scale assault on anyone that threatens the United States, we are concerned about the way we're treating the fucking criminals we've captured. I'm sorry, but you can shove their rights up your collective liberal ass. Where were the rights of the people that died to those two planes on Sept. 11th.<P>So, basically the intent of my post is to say, I don't care how the Middle East is handled. I don't care whose toes are stepped upon, whose feelings are hurt, or how many people we piss off. You know why? Because they don't give two shits about us. When they burn our flag in their streets, and cheer at footage of our people dying in that disaster, why should we as a people care about them?<P>I'll leave you with a lengthy quote from one of my all-time favorite movies. I've changed a couple of lines, to make it more topical, but you'll get the gist..<P>Col. Nathan Jessup USMC<BR>"A Few Good Men"<P>"We live in a world that has walls, and those walls are guarded by men with guns. Who's going to do it? You?<P>People dying, while tragic, saves lives. And, the existence of the military, while grotesque, and incomprehensible to you, saves lives.<P>You don't want the truth because deep down, in places that you don't talk about at parties, you want me on that wall. You need me on that wall. <P>We use words like Honor, Code, Loyalty. We use these words as the backbone of a life spent defending something. You use them as a punchline.<P>I have neither the time, nor inclination to explain myself to a person that rises and sleeps under the very blanket of the Freedom that I provide, then questions the manner in which I provide it. I would rather you just said, "Thank you." and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon, and stand a post. <P>Either way, I could give a damn about what you feel you are entitled."<P><BR>That quote, while addressing another issue, sums up my feelings about people questioning the actions of the United States, when concerning the defense of our land and people.<P><BR>Piece,<P>Pah

Well, given that the good General's salary and accomodations are being paid by American citizens like me and our tax dollars, I would think that yes, we are entitled to voice our opinions as to the defense of our country.<P>And what is my opinion?  The General is not entirely wrong.<P>By way of analogy, look back at the cave men.  A typical tribe was comprised of the hunters/gatherers on the one hand, and the home-makers on the other.  The hunters/gatherers were the ones that met life's true hardships head on.  By virtue of their role, they saw what a jungle the world really was, and their goal in life was to grapple with the ferocity of that jungle, kill or be killed,  and survive at all costs so that hopefully, they could provide an environment that would insulate the home-makers and children of the tribe from these harsh realities.  For the hunter/gatherers out in the fierce jungle, civility and civil liberties were not much of a priority to say the least.  Now imagine that the hunters/gatherers are wildly successful, and in fact do provide an extremely comfortable and insulated home environment to the home-makers and children of the tribe. How would the world look from the insulated perspective of the home-makers in this instance?  When the home-makers just have meals, homes, children, civility and docile labor to worry about, the world appears softer and gentler than it really is no?<P>Herein lies a flaw with our democracy. Our tribe is the USA, and the sabre-toothed tigers and wooly mammoths have been replaced with the Middle Eastern crisis, Iraq, etc., but thanks to the brilliant success of our country, we are comprised almost exclusively of insulated home-makers, and barely any hunters/gatherers who truly appreciate the harsh realities of this world.  We either have 80% of the voting public living in their comfy homes watching Buffy on the couch with a beer or taking the kids to the soccer game while thinking "I am sure those folks in Iraq must be nice, just like Aunt Mable", or we have 10% immigrants who, unlike immigrants 30 years ago, no longer have any interest in assimilating and consider having American values put upon them as a violation of their civil liberties, and thus are not in the least bit tuned into American issues and don't really care.<P>Where is a country's will if not with the voters?<P>The will of America is therefore now defined by voters who do not understand or appreciate the direness of this world we live in, and will never be willing to vote for changes in policy that would benefit us in the long run, if such changes might impact their short run comforts.  Comforts in the form of their bundle of civil liberties, rights, and peace.  These people, justifiably clueless by having been insulated all their lives, just don't understand why we should have to kill that sabre-toothed tiger that keeps prowling outside the cave at night.  "What of his right to live and provide for his kittens?" they say.  "His civil liberties?"  "His rights?" they say.  "He is not attacking us, just prowling outside, so don't start trouble."  These innocent morons - a large majority of voters - don't truly appreciate that our civil liberties are nothing more than the icing on the cake that is this great country built by the blood of hundreds of thousands of dead soldiers who were not really thinking much about the rights, liberties or concerns of their foes.  The vast majority of voters, brainwashed ever moreso by the liberal media, just don't understand how ridiculously harsh this world is in light of the egotism and greed of humanity.  We are so pathetically insulated, the media is only allowed to show documentaries such as the ones showing the atrocities that happened in say, Sierra Leone, late at night on obscure channels no one really pays much attention to.<P>We like our safe, insulated environment here.  Why watch documentaries about thousands of men, women and children having their appendages hacked off with machetes or beheaded on the very same day we get up and go to Toys R Us to buy lil Courtney her new McDonaldland Barbie?  We don't want anyone coming around showing us the ugliness of that jungle out there!  How to protect ourselves?  How to insulate ourselves?  Let's always pull out the "violation of civil liberties" card to ensure we can stay in our insulated slumber.  The only time we are willing to awaken from our slumber is well, when someone does it for us by shocking us awake like Pearl Harbor or 9/11.  We stay awake, briefly acknowledge the world for the ferocious place it is, and make some changes to feel like we are protected again, then it's off to sleep again.  To the insulated nirvana of ignorance and denial that we do, in fact, live in a jungle.<P>Osama Bin Laden was wrong when he thought American will would be weak in response to a terrorist attack the size of 9/11 (although if you recall our measly responses to the USS Cole and embassy attacks, perhaps he wasn't off his rocker), but he was most certainly right in believing the American will is weak in general when it comes to facing the jungle that is the world today and making difficult shifts in policy, such as what it would take to force, not merely suggest, but force, an international solution to the Middle East crisis - a solution that would end up being better for America, Israel, and the world.<P>That's my take on it, and I would love to some day be proven wrong.<p>[ May 16, 2002: Message edited by: Lizard ]<P>--------------------<P>Scaled, for her pleasure<BR><A HREF="http://drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Sssorn" TARGET=_blank>Profile</A> | <A HREF="http://www.drow.org/news.shtml" TARGET=_blank>BotS</A>

I like to think of myself as a hunter-gatherer. What they did to those children in Sierra Leone was horrible. Rebel soldiers came in and chopped off babies arms, legs, hands so that they couldn't grow up and fight. Most of them are just torsos.  All I can say is it is sick.<P>I agree completely with Sorn. Kill or be killed. Only the strong survive. I blame our response on the embassy bombings and attack on U.S.S. Cole on Ex-President Bill Clinton. I hope you are proved wrong Sorn but it is unlikely. I'm still waiting on that nuke to finally get us to really, really act.<P>--------------------<P>Always Faithful<BR>LEEZARDZ 4 ever!<BR>Team  DAoC<BR>"That which does not kill us, makes us stronger."

The Sierra Leone atrocities were just a random example that came to mind to illustrate just how savage humanity is.  The examples are endless.  I would venture to say that we were safer back when we only had sabre-toothed tigers to worry about rather than religious fanatics with the power to issue mass death and destruction thanks the wonders of modern explosive and biological technology.  <P>Well anyway, back to Toys-R-Us and the Teletubbies.<P>--------------------<P>Scaled, for her pleasure<BR><A HREF="http://drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Sssorn" TARGET=_blank>Profile</A> | <A HREF="http://www.drow.org/news.shtml" TARGET=_blank>BotS</A>

How did the Romans stop the Celts in the end? From completely destroying them in battle over and over. Through mass defeats came a broken will. I doubt anybody could claim to have been as fanatical as the celts. Simply put, the only way to end this ongoing war is to have one side destroy the other.

OooooOoo to tear your little rant appart will be a pleasure mr. Dr. Iwillstupifyyah.<P>Your first two paragraphs made so little sense I could not decipher your idiotish with enough skill to fully comprehend the gibberish I was presented with. <P>Very true on the next paragraph though. Wanna know why? A) Suicide bombers are included in the figures. B) Sometimes, when you go up to a tank, or a soldier, and throw rocks at him, or at the tank... you get shot, C) On some occaisions, when Israel tries to go after terrorists they do this <img align=top src="http://www.alistriwen.onestop.net/Soldiers.jpg"</img> Of course since Isralias don't exist... <P>You recall that? Funny, because I recall that the reason they hate Israel is because they want the land Israel is on and can't get it, As per War of Independance, 1967 war, and any other Israel-Islam war there has been since 1948. I mean they were all initiated by Islamic countries right? They lost, and lost land as a result, don't see how that implies Israel wants more land. Then again, coming from someone who obviously takes very little time to form an opinion, and forgot to go through grade one spelling could come to all sorts of conclusions. <P>Next paragraph, more crap. I could say the same about Ol' Yasser. I mean, he doesn't stop sending his suicide bombers into Israel. I guess he doesn't want peace. Furthermore my uneducated little friend, Israel did begin withdrawl, a few times. Their reward: more suicide bombers YAY! Until the suicide bombings stop, there will not be any withdrawing, no sir. <P>Agreed, a lot of people DON'T know the facts about this, you included. Israel IS the a holy land to 3 major religions, however Islam only has one really important site in Israel, whereas Christianity and Judaism have many. The holiest place for Muslims is Mecca. And yes, Israel does belong to one group. There are very Holy Buddhists sites in Afghanistan. The Buddhists don't claim any right to that country do they? Of course, Israel lets any Christian, Jew, Muslim, or even Buddhist who would like to come in and worship at a holy site do so - provided they aren't terrorist scum. <P>It was clear you didn't read this all, because otherwise you'd know your arguments had already been discussed, and put aside. Nope, not all Islamic bashing, mostly just the bashing of Terrorists ala Ara-rat. I don't consider all terrorists Muslims, nor do I consider all Muslims Terrorists. I think there are a lot of Muslim terrorists, but not the entire population of 1.3 billion according to latest figures. <P>As for the reason Islam is growing so quickly... a few ideas:<BR>A) No birth control<BR>B) Reproducing like bunnies with 6 or 7 wives a piece<BR>C) Need soldiers<P>I mean, the African continent has one of the fastest growing populations too... we don't claim it to be anything other than a lack of restraint....

Good points Ali, the previous "enlighten you" poster (who couldn't even spell that right) was full of gibberish, and you were able to read more into it than I was apparently.  Think I gave up when he lumped Americans as all being KKK, etc.  That's no different than our stating all Muslims MUST be terrorists because they're Muslim, which they aren't, I'm just stating that as an example.  So ya, he needs to pull his head out of his ass.  Liked the pic of Palestine/Israel soldiers, soooo very true...cowards...*scowls*<P>--------------------<P><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=190294" TARGET=_blank><B>_Marlonius Fieldmedic_</A></B><P>59 Monk - League of Levity

Haha.  This whole post is supposed to be about a solution, not a huge drawn out bitch fight about who is right and who is wrong.  There is always two sides to any story / battle and every side , inevitably, always thinks they are right.  It is obvious from all of your posts, Alis, that you have reserved reasons behind your so-called facts.  Now I understand that it is normal for someone who are religious to back their faith and its people, but how can you claim to be a know-it-all?  You are quick to point out some of the weaknesses of Arafat and arab nation's policies towards Israel, but fail to even mention or recognize Israel and the West's policies towards the rest of the world.  When someone mentions a viable reason to why some Arabs might have harsh/uneasy feelings towards Israel and the West, you dismiss them as terrorists.(Quite easy to do and relatively close to the way Hitler grouped all your people together.)  <P>One of the most despicable things you do throughout your posts is to degrade another religion which is very close to your own.  I'm not a religious scholar, but I believe Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are all Abrahamic religions(sp?).  Yet, you are quick to denounce another religion and say its growth is only for a few reasons..<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><HR><BR>As for the reason Islam is growing so quickly... a few ideas:<BR>A) No birth control<BR>B) Reproducing like bunnies with 6 or 7 wives a piece<BR>C) Need soldiers<BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Islam, unlike your continous postings of bullshit suggest, is a peaceful religion.  Just like Christianity is takinen to the extreme up in Ireland, Islam can also be taken to the extreme.  It's called fanaticism ...duh?  Until religion is extinct/gone, there will be fanaticism.  Infact, You see various cults everywhere in the world for different religious denominations.  (Think KKK, Islamic Hate Groups, Neo Nazis, blah blah blah) All of these use religion as their backbone to do hateful acts.  Now, with that said, are you going come down on Christians for the Pope not denouncing Hitler's acts or the KKK hanging black, jews, etc?  <P>It is not your religious beliefs which make your "facts" less credible, but your unwillingness to "wear the other people's shoes" and look at their point of view.  Israel has not been a saint, just like the those who are killing innocent civilians in Israel are not saints.  I think if you put your own beliefs and feelings aside and actually listened to why people hold distrust in Israel, the U.S and other such nations, you will be shocked to see that there are viable reasons for them.  Speaking about the U.S, we always go in to spots of the world which we hold interest for various economic and political reasons.  For every thing we do that is supposed to be one step forward for humanity, we take one to two steps back.  I'm glad you mentioned Africa where hundreds of thousands are killed in Genocide each year, yet we haven't done a thing to stop it.  Why? No oil or real political/economical reason.  Think about all the times NATO has given another country arms, money, and other such things for their own best interest, yet to leave the country in shambles after our interest is done(Afghanistan).  All of these policies relate to the Middle Eastern struggle between Palestine because it is the bigger picture of factions and relations.  This isn't even bringing into how Israel as a state was created.<P>One last thing to take into consideration.  Israel has an army, Palestine does not.  The only way they have to fight against any Israeli aggression, justified or not, is the bombings they have done or rebel-like fighters.<P>Anyways...since this is about a solution, i'll give my solution.  Oh shit, I have none since it is the blinders similar to that which you wear that continue to keep this conflict going for everyone involved.  Media, civilians, military, etc.  <P>Lukieb<p>[ May 28, 2002: Message edited by: Lukieb2 ]

I tend to agree with Lukie completely, especially his last paragraph.  I am glad Mr. Enlightenya stopped by, and appreciate his comments.  Some of them were entirely accurate.  Ali's response, although sprinkled with good points, was unfortunate in the tone he took.  But his post was also illustrative of another factor driving Arab hatred for Israel - humiliation.  Regardless how right Israel might be in all of its claims and defenses, there will never be a justification that will be acceptable to the Palestinians for the humiliation they have felt for couple of generations.<P>Thus once again we find ourselves at that place where it doesn't matter any more who is wrong or right, let's just end this.  The fact remains that tossing insults back and forth in a debate about who is wrong or right is flat out pointless, and is the very thing that has gotten us nowhere in 60 years, other than the place we find ourselves which is as the targets of militant extremists who have learned thanks to this very crisis, that terrorism is their only viable tool.<P>--------------------<P>Scaled, for her pleasure<BR><A HREF="http://drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Sssorn" TARGET=_blank>Profile</A> | <A HREF="http://www.drow.org/news.shtml" TARGET=_blank>BotS</A>

Excuse me? I have said on more than one hundred occaisions it is not the Islamic faith that is wrong, but the people who twist it out of proportion. My facts about Islam being the quickest growing religion in the world are true. Go take a look in some of the countries in the nation of Islam, they do have a lot of children. <P>I don't know precisely why all of Israel's neighbors hate Israel. The only reason I can come up with is that they want to replace it with a Muslim state. They invaded Israel several times before occupation, and before Israel ever took any more land. Israel's land occupation occured during wars in which the Arabs initiated the violence. <P>I do not care about the Israeli conflict because of my religion, you could not be further from the truth. I do it because I have lost family to suicide bombers, and frankly I don't see any of you who can claim the same. My opinions come frome extensive research, which you - Lukieb, try to ignore. You constantly attack me, without giving your own opinion, or points or facts to counter mine. <P>I can tell Lukieb you have some pent up hostility against Israel and the Western world, that is your right, but again, you give no explanation as to why you have these feelings. Furthermore, no one groups all Muslims as terrorists, however, as someone pointed out elsewhere, out of the 14 major conflicts in the world today, 8 involve Muslim States. Out of the terror the world experiences today, MOST of it is conducted by Islamic militants. <P>I resent the fact that YOU who probably heard about the holocaust in some gr. 11 history class, presume to tell me just how Hitler grouped and killed off 7 of my grandmother's brothers and sisters, her parents, and several dozen other members of my family. Your lack of respect, is unparalleled. <P>By saying Islam is growing for these reasons, I am hardly denouncing it. I think Islam is a very peaceful, and noble religion. Unfortunately there are a lot of people who twist texts and use them as an excuse for terror. When was the last time you saw a Christian blow up civlians and say Jesus told them to do it? I mean even in Ireland the Irish terrorists only attacked military and governmental sites, and then only claimed political reasons. When there are groups out there like the El-Aksha Martyrs brigade, promising eternal life in heaven and 70 young virgins to boot for every Jew killed. <P>Again I will stress, as you have chosen to ignore in ALL of my previous posts here or on the RTA I do not have anything against Islam. My problem is with the Muslims who A) conduct terror or B) support terror. <P>You continually say Israel is wrong Israel is wrong. How are they wrong? Do you need a history lesson? 1948 British make a division into Israel/Palestine. Muslims refuse, saying they want all of it. 1948 Muslim nations invade Israel. Israel repells hoards takes additional land to bolster security, no occupation. Between 1900 and 1967, there are hundreds of seperate instances of terror. There is no occupation, no aggression, nothing, Israel is content to live and let live. 1967, Muslim nations again attempt to invade Israel unprovoked, they fail, Israel takes land to further increase security. Rampant terror, and the threat of further terror or invasion prompts Israeli occupation. Occupation continues, terror continues. Several more invasions are defeated, no additional land is taken during any of these wars. Israel and Egypt make peace. Israel in all of it's glorified expansionism gives back the sinai that they had earned in war with Egypt, when Egypt had tried to invade them. Israel pulls out of Lebanon by request of Syria, is promised the cessation of terror. Hezbollah attacks intensify. 1990s Israel and Palestine begin to negotiate. Israel asks for ONE thing a stop to terror, and they will remove occupation troops, and even help the Palestinians form a state. Terror continues, occupation continues. Late 1990s Israel and Palestine broker another deal. Israel begins pull back of troops, terror increases. Troops go back in. Israeli Prime-Minister offers Ara-rat 99% of what he wants (In a country that you can drive from end to end in less than a day, and around the entire perimiter in less than 24 hours), and asks only the stop of terror. Ara-rat walks away, intifada begins, here we are. <P>As for the no military. Again I will use the example of Ghandi, who had no army, but uprooted the British, and got India. I could understand if perhaps Israel was launching daily raids into Palestinian territory, which they are not, or if the homicide bombers and gunmen only attacked military targets, but neither is true. The only way there will ever be a Palestinian state is at the bargainning table, and right now, it doesn't look promising. <P>Given all this, tell me my feelings are unfounded. Tell me that Islam has justification to feel hostility towards Israel, tell me that Israel is aggressive and expansionistic, tell me that I am wrong, and that my family is the aggressor. Tell me it is occupation and humiliation that brings on terror, even though there was none of that for 67 years. Liken what Israel does in it's self defense to what Hitler did to wipe out my ancestors, and then you will hear no more from me. Lukieb, if you tell me all of those things, I will refuse to give any credibility to anything you say, and as far as Im concerned you are an advocate of terror. <P>As for you Lizard, I'd like to know exactly which points Dr. whoever made were accurate. I mean afterall, you've spent several years of your life studying the issue, and have visited Israel and Palestine and talked to the people. You have seen the aggression on both sides, and as an expert on the issue, can call his points completely accurate. <P>Lastly I will agree with you, I keep getting hyped up about this, and really nothing I say on a MMORPG message board will ever change anyone's mind. Face to face is all that matters, and I have changed a few people's opinions that way. There is a forseeable solution to the conflict. Cease terror, get peace. I can guarantee you that if terror stopped tommorow, and I mean stopped for good, not this bullshit one week thing, the Israeli government would be more than willing to talk peace, and create the Palestinian state. Until then, there is no solution but retaliatory strikes to uproot terror. That is my opinion, and that is all.

Well let me be more to the point , im talking about people that were from different religons/backgrounds converting to a Muslim...not people who have kids.<P>Also that bullshit picture , show me once when a Palastinian used a civialian as a human shield....sorry they dont do that.Also thanks for the remark on why the death toll is much higher cause those kids that were killed were just throwing rocks...so fuck it shot em eh?<P>No my friend you are the dumb fuck and you basically saying its ok for Israels Army to kill people throwing rocks but when one straps a bomb to his chest and rips a building apart its not right cause he killed civilians , what do you think those kids that throw those rocks , soldiers i think not friend.<P>Also i dont support those attacks on those civilian targets at all , if they hit military targets yes thats what war is about.Just so no one gets confused and begins to spew more shit.<P>Maybe im biased here , but its all bullshit in the Middle-East and there will never be peace there unless one of the sides gets driven out for good.But that wont happen so only thing left is the war will spread and it will when US invades Iran/Iraq one of the 2 is next i think it will be Iran and it will go from there and Nukes will be used at one point and Bush will continue to cleanse Muslim controlled countries till he doesnt get re-elected then MAYBE ther might be some solution..but i dont see that happening.<P>I also im curious , if someone wants to answer this....why is that Muslims dislike jews as people like to put it...i mean was there a point somewhere when they split and disliked Jewish people...cause they helped alot Jewish people during the Nazi Genocide by alowing em to enter into Muslim controlled countries and also when Muslims held Israel at one point in History they let all those people within the Islamic State to pratice there religon.<P>I mean i dont see why all this hate , someone pleace explain if yah know so much on this matter.I for one am Muslim and i have nothin against anyone except Modern day Hitler Solbadan Milosevic fucking piece of shit mother fucker that is still alive in a fucking jail cell and thats responsible for like close to 300,000 deaths(all which were muslims) and that wasnt called terrorism and it took what 7 some odd years before they tried to stop him.<P>Why i mention this is cause i had 2 cousins shot mulitple times and dismembered and urinated on just because they were Muslim Albanians they were automatically labeled as being in the K.L.F.<P>No one seem to fucking care when that was going on over in the Balkans , fuck it who cares they are Muslim and its Christains doing the killing so let em be.<p>[ May 29, 2002: Message edited by: Dr.Iwillenlightenyah ]

This thread has run its course and at this point is just looping itself, not really getting anywhere, since the posters now can't get off the "right/wrong" debate, which is pointless.  <P>Everyone's comments were appreciated.

....lol I must support terrorism because I don't agree fully with what you are saying alis.  Furthermore, I have no respect for your family who have left us due to my post?  Man get a fucking grip.  I'm sorry your family has taken some losses from the bullshit that goes on over there.  My post wasn't to degrade you, judaism or support terrorism and their acts, it was to express how I feel about your posts.  If your blinders are so shut that you actually think that my post was supporting terrorism, then you need to get a grip.  Maybe instead of studying one side of the whole conflict, you should study both so that you can give an accurate reprentation of both sides.  Furthermore, my Hitler analogy is based on all of your posts in which you group all of the Arabs together and follow the stereotypes given to them in the Western World.  No, you did not say Islam, but in the way you classify them, you are referring to it.  Anyways, you tore apart my post and didn't even attempt to see where I was coming from.  I am not anti-Israel or West, but I do not agree with alot of our policies and reserve the right to disagree.  <P>One last thing.  You bring up Ghandi...uhhh you actually think that this would help them? Oh and BTW, I didn't liken what Hitler did to Israel's self-defense.  I was relating your statements and classification/gropuing whole ethnic groups as to what he did.  ARABS ARABS ARABS.  So instead of twisting around what I said, maybe you should read it.  I think your posts are more out of passion then anything else.<P>Lukieb

You are entitled to your opinion Lukieb, wrong as I may think of it. However, as Lizard over there said, the thread has run it's course, and we could argue at verbatim and never achieve anything. I mean before this whole thing I never knew you exist, now you probably hate me and think of me as some sort of ignorant fool right? So constantly replying has achieved squat. <P>So goodbye, and PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST!

Naa.  I don't hate anyone.  Like I said, I just disagreed with some of the things you were saying.  That's all...Nothing big.  Everything is debateable and sometimes peoples emotions get out of hand.  I didn't mean anything by that Hitler thing and quite frankily, I didn't even read about your family having deaths in Palestine or else I would have been more sincere.  Anyways.  Have fun in game bro...if you need help and see me logged on, don't hestitate to shoot me a tell.<P>Lukieb

With this topic seemingly winding down, can anyone point me to some recommended reading on the middle east, our role there, and perhaps US foreign policy in general? I know there are plenty of places to find the same information online but I feel more comfortable asking people who've _demonstrated_ some understanding of the subject matter.<P>Regards,<P>Laod<BR>CoN - The Rathe

Well I don't purport to be an expert on the subject by any means, and most of my information has come from the print media, especially The Economist.  The Washington Times has been running a series breaking down the history of Israel and its troubles in great detail the last few months and I have drawn a lot of information from that.  As far as books go, sorry, but I can find more enjoyable things to read than the Middle Eastern conflict especially when we are all  inundated by it in the news every single day.<P>--------------------<P>Scaled, for her pleasure<BR><A HREF="http://drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Sssorn" TARGET=_blank>Profile</A> | <A HREF="http://www.drow.org/news.shtml" TARGET=_blank>BotS</A>

Hi all, long time  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0">.<P>Nice encyclopedic post. Can't say I read all this.  I glance over most of it.  Just to clear something up.  This fight isn't about Jews vs Palestines.  It's about their two government fighting it out.  You think the people really want to have war?  I'm pretty sure most of them are sick of it about now. Can the people live together? sure.  The same can't be said about their government. <P>One or both of the governemnt has to go.  I'm not saying which is right or which should go fuck themselves but I think if we pledged to fight terrorism everywhere...it should mean just that.<BR>Anyway peace out,<P>Hbay
