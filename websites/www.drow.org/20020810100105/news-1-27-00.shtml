				  Mother of all updates! 1st of all regarding the last year for BotS/Bod aka<br>
				  Guild Drow. We had a very successful year securing a huge list of server<br>

				  number 27. All in all a great run which will continue into 2001 and into<br>
				  our next target game Shadowbane in the future.<br><br>
				  In the past month we have been very busy killing Trakanon 28 through 37<br>
				  filling our bank with more worthless BP's waiting on the illusive Donals<br>
				  to drop. Ventured into Veeshans peek killing Silverwing twice and became<br>
				  the 6th guild to kill Hoshkar. We've plundered the sissy newbie dragons<br>
				  in Western Wastes, killed Gorenaire 2 and 3 and Talendor 2 through 5.<br>
				  We have also pillaged the Plane of Growth and whacked several Venril<br>
				  Sather's as well as completing 10+ epic quests. Now for your pleasure a<br>
				  selection of visuals that won't be rivaled for some time. First our <br>
				  plundering of Candyland aka <a href="eq/misc/pog.shtml">Plane of Growth</a>. Later another update<br>

                  Well Folks, I hate to bring you bad news before the holidays but<br>
                  unfortunately, this is the case. And it's real bad news.<br><br>
                  For going on 5 years now, CLAN DROW has provided some of the finest<br>
                  servers to the Quake community. An ISP called <a href="http://www.one.net/">OneNet communications</a><br>
                  has been kind enough to let us host our server boxes in their data<br>
                  centers during this time. <br><br>
                  Not too long ago, OneNet was purchased by <a href="http://www.mdm.net/">MDM communications</a>.<br>
                  The new company is tightening the belt and as a result, OneNet can no<br>
                  longer sponsor connectivity for the DROW Servers. :-(<br><br>
                  Unfortunately they have given us a deadline of next week to remove our<br>
                  servers. So, sadly I have to report that our servers will be unavailable<br>
                  until we can find a new home for them. Currently, there is no ETA.<br><br>
                  One thing is for certain, DROW will not settle for hosting on substandard<br>
                  connectivity. HOWEVER, wherever the servers end up, it will be a different<br>
                  IP address. This means that if you currently have a great ping to our<br>
                  servers, you may not in the future. We won't know for sure until we<br>
                  find a new home for them.<br><br>
                  How can you help? I'm not sure that you can. But if you'd like to send<br>
                  email asking OneNet to try and find a way to keep them alive, knock<br>
                  yourself out. <a href="mailto:help@one.net">Help@one.net</a> is the only address I can give out<br>
                  publicly for them. But, those of you who are more resourceful might<br>
                  surf around on the website links I mentioned earlier in search of more<br>
                  <i>important</i> addresses to add to your destinations :)<br><br>

                  Going to try to finish the ABOUT page today and maybe get around to writing<br>
                  a cgi that will 'cookie' the intro so you only have to click skip intro once a<br>

                  BotS did Sky on 10/1/00, but I was waiting on Doc to put up the new site to do<br>
                  the update. As expected, BotS went straight to the top of the zone, completing<br>
                  8 quests on the way, several of which were for the first time ever on<br>
                  The Rathe. Many other high level quest items and related drops were also<br>
                  achieved.<br><br>

                  Welcome to the new Organization DROW Web Site! Mass work to do still, but<br>
                  I put it up anyway because everyone was buggin me and its already more<br>
                  up-to-date than our old site.<br><br>
                  First off, this site looks like absolute shit in anything but IE5.<br><br>
                  Site TODO list: Fix netscape CSS, finish about/join pages, finish news<br>
                  management tool, bug Emil to finish Members/Roster section, setup the<br>
                  archives area which is to be sort of a visual gallery of DROW's<br>
                  competative past, setup our own message boards so we don't have to<br>
                  link to slow ass ezboard, finish files section, links section, add<br>
                  the Q3 servers to the servers list and a brief FAQ about our servers,<br>
                  add a link somewhere for DROW's language terms.<br><br>
                  ALSO, I need to finish the whole right column which is currently not<br>
                  displayed at all. The right column includes a cool poll each week.<br>
                  Also need to finish the bottom of the page, add some stuff.<br>
