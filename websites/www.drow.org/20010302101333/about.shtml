                  <blockquote>
                  Before you read any further, consider for a moment the history<br>
                  of online competative gaming. 6 years ago, it was a relatively new<br>
                  concept. Games such as DOOM were just beginning to scratch the<br>
                  surface. Today, it's entirely possible to be a professional<br>
                  competative gamer and earn a good living doing it.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now consider how far we've come in the past 5 years. Also, <br>
                  consider where online gaming is headed. Virtual Reality is no<br> 
                  longer a cheesy buzzword monopolized by Hollywood.<br>
                  <br>
                  The direction of the gaming industry is BIGGER and BETTER.<br>
                  <br>
                  Countless millions of dollars are being poured into the development<br>
                  of "Massively Multiplayer" and "Persistent Universe" game engines.<br>
                  <a href="http://www.shadowbane.com/">Shadowbane</a>, <a href="http://www.uo2.com/">Ultima Online II</a>, and <a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com/">Anarchy Online</a> are just a few<br>
                  examples of many to come.<br>
                  <br>
                  With such technology being rapidly developed, the ability for<br>
                  an individual to compete alone is a thing of the past. Soon, <br>
                  even the 4 person clan will be a minority, if not extinct.<br>
                  <br>
                  We are an organization who believes there is indeed strength<br>
                  in numbers.<br>
                  <br>
                  Simply put, we are an organized group of people who enjoy online<br>
                  competative gaming. Much more than an average Quake clan, we<br>
                  are over 150 members world wide and support teams in multiple<br>
                  popular gaming genres.<br>
                  <br>
                  As a DROW member, there's no need to spend time finding another<br>
                  clan to join when you change games. Chances are, your DROW<br>
                  brothers will have already established a strong presence in <br>
                  that game, allowing you to hit the ground running.<br>

                  <blockquote>
                  DROW started out life as just a quake clan. Over 5 years ago, <a href="mailto:kalorin@drow.org">Kalorin</a><br>
                  and Hammer decided to start a Quake clan. This was just after the first<br>
                  commercial launch of Quake 1. (Now known as NetQuake)<br>
                  <br>
                  <a href="mailto:kalorin@drow.org">Kalorin</a> and Hammer then recruited <a href="mailto:doc@drow.org">Doc</a>, the third member. At the time<br>
                  the name for the clan had not been decided. <a href="mailto:kalorin@drow.org">Kalorin</a>, being a D&Der,<br>
                  suggested DROW because in the D&D world, they are known as a very<br>
                  feared race. Neither Hammer nor <a href="mailto:doc@drow.org">Doc</a> could come up with something<br>
                  better, so DROW it was.<br>
                  <br>
                  Shortly after, <a href="mailto:mistabone@drow.org">mIstabone</a> from clan DAWG started frequenting servers<br>
                  that the 3 DROWs played on. During one FFA game, <a href="mailto:mistabone@drow.org">mIstabone</a> beat<br>
                  <a href="mailto:doc@drow.org">Doc</a>. Afterwards, Doc challenged mIstabone to a 1 on 1 deathmatch.<br>
                  <a href="mailto:doc@drow.org">Doc</a> won, but it wasn't easy. <a href="mailto:doc@drow.org">Doc</a> then told <a href="mailto:mistabone@drow.org">mIstabone</a> about the newly<br>
                  formed CLAN DROW, and <a href="mailto:mistabone@drow.org">mIstabone</a> became the fourth member.<br>
                  <br>
                  Soon after, our ranks began to grow. Members such as <a href="mailto:tick@drow.org">TicK</a>, <a href="mailto:kayan@drow.org">Kayan</a>,<br>
                  and <a href="mailto:trystan@drow.org">Trystan</a> would be the first of several to join.<br>
                  <br>
                  CLAN DROW went on to experience some success in the NQCTF<br>
                  scene. With <a href="mailto:tick@drow.org">TicK</a>, <a href="mailto:kalorin@drow.org">Kalorin</a>, <a href="mailto:doc@drow.org">Doc</a>, and <a href="mailto:mistabone@drow.org">mIstabone</a> as the starting 4,<br>
                  our reputation began to grow.<br>
                  <br>
                  However, during the <a href="http://www.quakeworld.net/">QuakeWorld</a> years, CLAN DROW<br>
                  focused on team death match. <a href="mailto:crockme@drow.org">CrockMe</a> (previously of Dark<br>
                  Requiem) and Thorn (of the <a href="http://www.pgl.net/">Professional Gamers League</a>)<br>
                  join the clan, as our mission was compatible with their appetities<br>
                  for ass kicking. :)<br>
                  <br>
                  And thus one of the best 4x4 squads in the history of QWDM was<br>
                  created: <a href="mistabone@drow.org">mIstabone</a> (RA), <a href="mailto:doc@drow.org">Doc</a> (box), <a href="mailto:crockme@drow.org">CrockMe</a> (Quad), Thorn (Bridge).<br>
                  <br>
                  Unfortunately, by this time, many people had moved on to Quake 2<br>
                  so we didn't get much of a chance to participate in the QWDM<br>
                  scene. <a href="mailto:crockme@drow.org">CrockMe</a> decided to organize QLS (Quake's Last Stand)<br>
                  which was a Chicago Quake-1 LAN party in April 1999.<br>
                  <br>
                  Representatives from several of the most popular Q1 clans showed<br>
                  up, including the full starting squad of arguably the best QWDM<br>
                  team at the time, <a href="http://www.negativeburn.com/">Negative Burn</a>. DROW and nB pretty much breezed<br>
                  through the 4x4 tournament bracket only to meet each other in the<br>
                  final where DROW won 4 out of 5 games. Demos and screen shots can<br>
                  be seen in our <a href="archives.shtml">archives</a> section.<br>
                  <br>
                  Since then, DROW has went on to sponsor guilds in <a href="http://www.owo.com/">Ultima Online</a>,<br>
                  and <a href="http://www.everquest.com/">Everquest</a>. In fact, Organization DROW's Everquest team (known<br>
                  as Brotherhood of the Spider), under the leadership of <a href="mailto:mIstabone@drow.org">mIstabone</a><br>
                  as guild GM, is considered to be one of the finest guilds to ever<br>
                  play the game.<br>

                  in multiple gaming environments.<br>
                  <br>
                  There are three major components to our structure: Core member,<br>
                  Team leader, and Team member.<br>

                  DROW is a leaderless organization. Instead, we are diplomatic.<br>
                  Issues are decided by popular vote. Only core members may<br>
                  participate in polls.<br>
                  <br>
                  Team leaders are a very important part of our organization. They<br>
                  are responsible for screening, recruiting, structuring, and<br>
                  maintaining their respected teams. A team leader will make sure<br>
                  that their team gets into appropraite tournaments, schedules<br>
                  scrimmages and matches, etc.<br>
                  <br>
                  Team members are the backbone of our organization. In some cases,<br>
                  such as in our <a href="http://www.everquest.com">Everquest</a> team (BotS), team members may not be<br>
                  a full core member of DROW. However, they are invited (and<br>
                  encouraged) to apply for such membership at anytime.<br>
                  <br>
                  Core members of DROW enjoy certain priviledges such as:<br>
                  Administrative rights to all DROW <a href="servers.shtml">servers</a>, an email address<br>
                  using @drow.org, a personal web page, voting, implicit invite<br>

                  <br>
                  First, we have a few requirements. Although, they are very few,<br>
                  they are very important to us:<br>
                  <br>
                  <table border="0" width="450" cellspacing="10">
                    <tr>
                      <td><font color="#ffff00">#1</font></td>
                      <td>You will be 100% DROW or 0% DROW. This means that we absolutely require that you are not involved with other CLANs or clubs. If you're currently a member of a clan, you would have to leave before being considered.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td><font color="#ffff00">#2</font></td>
                      <td><a href="terms.html" target="_new">Hide tanners</a> are generally not considered, especially for Team leader positions. However, we do make exceptions for those who are incredibly skilled and uncommonly mature.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td><font color="#ffff00">#3</font></td>
                      <td>We require loyalty. We do not consider people who become known as 'CLAN HOPPERS', or people who may not be ready to buy into our philosphy of a brotherhood.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td><font color="#ffff00">#4</font></td>
                      <td>If you're an asshole, we don't want ya. We don't care how good you are, if people consider you a jerk, you need not apply. DROW must provide teammates who enjoy each others company, otherwise an organization on our scale would not work.</td>
                    </tr>
                  </table>
                  Do you have what it takes to be DROW? If you think so, here's<br>
                  what you need to do:<br>
                  <br>
                  Write an email and send it to <a href="mailto:team@drow.org">recruiting@drow.org</a>.<br>
                  <br>
                  Your email should include details about yourself such as what games<br>
                  you enjoy, how old you are, where do you live, what you do for a living,<br>
                  how many hours per week you play online, what kind of computer you<br>
                  have, what kind of connection you have, what clans/clubs you've been<br>
                  a part of, and most importantly why you think you have what it takes<br>
                  to be DROW.<br>
                  <br>
                  If you are applying for a specific DROW team, you should also copy<br>
                  the team leader. See our <a href="roster.shtml">members</a> page for more details.<br>
                  <br>
                  If you are applying for a Team leader position for a new game,<br>
                  include details about the game and why you think it's a format<br>
                  that DROW needs to participate in.<br>
                  <br>
                  Emails including '3l33t c00l d3ewd' wording will likely be ignored.<br>
                  <br>
                  If you are applying for <a href="about.shtml#structure">core</a> membership, you will need to hang out on<br>
                  our <a href="chat.shtml">IRC channel</a> so that other core members can get to know you<br>
                  prior to casting their vote.
