A few months ago I started a thread on noows where I presented a solution to the Middle Eastern crisis based upon international intervention and the use of the UN as mediator.  Lots of folks argued with me back and forth so that together, we could see if any of these ideas made any sense.  In the end I concluded that no one had yet given a viable reason why not to go this route in order to form a lasting peace, aside from Israeli and American distrust of the international community.  <P>Here then, I copy and paste an interesting article from The Economist discussing the situation as it is today, and at the end you will notice a proposal that sounds somewhat similar...<P>--------------------------------------------<P>From here to Palestine<BR>Apr 11th 2002 <BR>From The Economist print edition<P>By accident, Ariel Sharon may have created an opportunity for peace<P>ARIEL SHARON invaded the West Bank in order, he said, to uproot terrorism and isolate Yasser Arafat. In the casbah of Nablus, the Jenin refugee camp and other towns and villages, Israeli soldiers appear to have killed several hundred armed Palestinians, and by most accounts many unarmed ones too. But it is Mr Sharon, not Mr Arafat, whom this onslaught has isolated. By defying the demands to withdraw issued by the United Nations, the United States and almost everyone else, Mr Sharon has enraged Israel's enemies, alienated its friends, and blackened its name in the court of world opinion.<P>To judge by his rising popularity at home, Israelis consider their international reputation a price worth paying for better odds of not being blown up on the bus to work. But the personal safety Mr Sharon promises them is illusory. The daily suicide attacks that provoked Israel's invasion stopped for nine days after the army went in, only to resume on the tenth. If Mr Arafat's fief were a state, it might be deterred from future violence by Israel's overwhelming force. But it is now even less of a state than it was before, less able than before to restrain the suicide bombers even if Mr Arafat wanted to. And in the meantime it is not only Israel's good name that Mr Sharon is destroying. He is also destroying something more precious: the belief of Israelis and Palestinians alike in the possibility of a just compromise between the claims of the two peoples. <P>Trapped in their endless blame game, each side accuses the other of killing hope. Both are right, in that both have failed. Mr Arafat has failed to honour his promise under the Oslo accords to prevent the territories he controls from being used as a springboard for guerrilla and terrorist attacks on Israel. But Mr Sharon has failed to offer Palestinians any believable prospect that they might realise their aims by non-violent means.<P>Greater Israel, again<BR>If this were just a case of refusing to bend under fire, Mr Sharon's failure might be forgivable; most Israelis believe that surviving depends on showing no weakness. The trouble with Mr Sharon is that he seems not to accept the principle upon which any imaginable peace must rest, namely Israel's evacuation of most of the land it conquered in 1967, so that a viable Palestinian state can arise in the West Bank and Gaza. Right now, he weeps crocodile tears over the collapse of the Oslo process he never supported. But under cover of fighting terrorism, he shows every sign of wanting to resurrect the vision of a “Greater Israel”, for ever in charge of the West Bank, which inspired Likud governments in the 1970s and 1980s. <P>In the Knesset this week, Mr Sharon promised to withdraw his army from the newly occupied territories, but only to “buffer zones”; to negotiate with a “responsible” Palestinian leadership, but not with Mr Arafat; and to seek a “long-term interim agreement”, not a final peace. He also expanded his government to take in the National Religious Party, led now by an ultra-nationalist who opposes any Palestinian sovereignty west of the River Jordan and predicts the eventual migration of the Palestinians out of the country. <P>If this is the fate that awaits the Palestinians after a ceasefire, Colin Powell, America's secretary of state, will have been wasting his time trying to arrange one. For such a ceasefire has absolutely no prospect of lasting. Having endured 35 years of long-term interim occupation, the Palestinians are in no mood to submit again to Israel's iron fist. As for Mr Arafat, it is no use Mr Sharon calling Mr Powell's decision to meet the Palestinian leader a “tragic mistake”. Like him or loathe him, whether he has condoned terrorism or not, he is the only leader whose legitimacy the Palestinians and therefore the rest of the world are prepared to recognise. If there is to be any sort of negotiated peace, it is going to need Mr Arafat's imprimatur.<P>Peace now?<BR>A negotiated peace looks more remote than ever. So the priority of George Bush, wary of tangling himself as Bill Clinton did in the arcane grievances of Arabs and Israelis, is to put out the fire before it spreads and complicates his plans for Iraq. But what a pity if this were the limit of his ambition. If the present mayhem shows anything, it is that the fire cannot be doused without also reviving hope. Israelis need to be able to hope that the terror will end without their soldiers having to stay in the West Bank to fight it. And Palestinians need to be able to hope that if the terror ends, the occupation will end too.<P>If America is serious about restoring hope, it cannot rely on its existing three-step plan for ending the intifada: a ceasefire, followed by resumed security co-operation, followed by confidence-building measures such as a freeze on Jewish settlements. For a paradoxical consequence of Mr Sharon's war is that this progression of modest steps now looks even less realistic than an immediate “leap” to a final peace. The Palestinian policemen fighting today alongside Palestinian gunmen cannot be expected to turn their brethren over to Israel tomorrow. Israel cannot be expected to trust them to. And even if some miracle eventually got them to the negotiating table, the gap between Messrs Sharon and Arafat looks unbridgeable.<P>This is why it is now time to risk that leap to a final settlement. This can no longer be based, as Oslo was, on the two sides making their own agreements and learning over time to trust one another; the gradualism of Oslo built hate, not confidence. So outsiders will have to do the work. For example, since Mr Arafat cannot or will not clamp down on terrorism, why not send an international force—armed, not just “monitors”—to take charge of security in the areas under his control? Since the parties cannot negotiate secure borders, as Resolution 242 of 1967 asked them to, why not have world powers—the “quartet”, say, of America, the UN, the European Union and Russia—map out such borders for them, and set a deadline for Palestinian independence? None of this would help a jot unless those powers, and especially the superpower, put sustained pressure on both sides to comply. But how disgraceful it would be if the answer to those “why nots?” was that the world at large, while calling piously for both sides to see reason, simply lacked the will to save them from each other.<P>--------------------<P>Scaled, for her pleasure<BR><A HREF="http://drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Sssorn" TARGET=_blank>Profile</A> | <A HREF="http://www.drow.org/news.shtml" TARGET=_blank>BotS</A>

I did not even read all that, but if you think that you can convince radical islamic fundamentalist from strapping bombs to their chests and running into areas full of innocent civilians and then detonating them by trying to appease them then you might be forgetting why we fought a world war. You simply cannot have peace this way, what creates peace is absolute and unquestionable victory. Many people would be afraid of how that sounds, but its a historical reality. If you read the newspapers and magazines today you would be surprised how many of them are pro-palestinian. At a peace conference at camp david Yasser Arafat was offered somewhere between 97 and 99% of the land he had previously demanded and the right to declare that a palestinian state in exchange for ending the suicide bombing and declaring Israel had the right to exist. He without saying a word got up and walked out.<P>I've lost a little faith in our government. We have a Bush doctrine saying we will denounce and oppose all terrorism, and yet we cripple Israel to defend themselves from it. Just like when they were being bombarded by scud missiles. We simply sit there and tell them that if you defend yourself you will hurt our attempts to make peace. It is nothing more than appeasement, and its rooted in our belief that for some reason we can convince people who exist to murder others whom they do not like because of race or religeon with any means other than destroying them is just not historically realistic.<P>Ofcourse people always complain about the poor innocent people who will die, and really why should anyone die, but thats more of an obvious scientific question than political question. I'll just leave you with that though.<P>--andrew

Very clearly spoken Sukar.  It is true, to this very day Arafat refuses to change the very mission upon which he rose to power; the eradication of an Israeli state by driving them all into the sea.  Metaphor or not its simply not possible to negotiate with such a closed mind.<BR> <BR>There is an excellent speech given to the senate by Benjamin Netanyahu from last week; email me if youd like to read it,i cant find the link atm.

The thing is, the course of action described at the end of the article would more than likely result in the absolute victory of which you speak.  Except the victory would be by the world on behalf of Israel, rather than by Israel itself.<P>Endless debate can go on about who is right and who is wrong and who should budge and what, but the bottom line is neither side is going to budge.  Thus, there is really no sense any more arguing about who is right or wrong, and instead, just looking for a solution.  Since neither side will budge, and since the longer this crisis continues the worse it will be for everyone involved, the only solution lies with a third party, as in, the rest of the world.  The rest of the world must come up with a solution that is neutral, so as not to reward terrorism.  I would think something commensurate to the concessions and borders established in the Oslo accords.<P>When two kids get in a fight in elementary school and get called to the principal and start blaming each other, what does the principal say?  "I don't care who started it or who is right or wrong, there is no fighting allowed in this school.  Whichever of you disobeys this rule the next time, will be expelled."<P>So as the article mentions, the international community will mediate and establish borders and institute a a peace plan, which both the Israelis and Palestinians must succumb to, without debate or argument.  Both sides will accept the plan because the price for failing to do so would mean confronting the collective will of the international community.  This solution would not be a reward to terrorism, nor would it be seen as a reward to Israel either.  It would be neutral, but with a very clear caveat - "if you abide by this solution you will receive the protection of the world, but if you defy the will of the international community and break the peace established by this solution, including any further jewish settlements in locations x, y or z, and including any more Arab suicide bombings, you will incur the military wrath of the entire world."<P>Once the solution is implemented, securing Israel's borders and establishing a Palestinian state, what do we know would eventually happen?  Militant arabs would at some point resume the suicide bombings no?  So what would happen then?<P>Instead of it being Israel defending itself by invading and razing Palestinian towns like Jenin to root out terrorists, it would be international forces making the Palestinians pay the price of defying the collective will of the world.<P>To me, this sounds like a far more enviable position for the Israelis to be in, at the cost of their sovereignty succumbing briefly to the will of the world, which appears to be something Israel is not willing to do, but could probably be forced to do so by the United States.  But as this article indicates, the jury is still out as to whether the U.S. and the world have the will to seize this chance for peace.<p>[ April 23, 2002: Message edited by: Lizard ]<P>--------------------<P>Scaled, for her pleasure<BR><A HREF="http://drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Sssorn" TARGET=_blank>Profile</A> | <A HREF="http://www.drow.org/news.shtml" TARGET=_blank>BotS</A>

I'm will have to strongly disagree with you on this notion Sssorn. You simply cannot compare two political states to two children, arguing in school over some mindless quandary. There has been over 50 years of conflict between Israel and the Arab states, that’s 50 years of living on constant edge of conflict, and more than once that conflict turned into "direct war" dispute. And for over 50 years Israel has put up with the constant oppression, with the Constant threats, constant terror, constant malice. There has been resistance to Israel’s existence since its independence in 1947. <P>You’re right, there are endless debates about who’s right and who’s wrong, and it’s really pointless to look into all of them, and as far as the solution goes…. Is there really a solution? There have been endless attempts to end hostility in the Middle East, each of them ending with nothing but more antagonism and fighting. Why is that? Who has provoked conflict 99% of the time? Why does Israel keep taking its troops out and needing to put them back in? Is there Really a peaceful way of dealing with the Arab nations, who teach their children from earliest years to hate Israel? I simply do not see that solution. There will Not be a simple cease fire in the Middle East just because the US and the “international community” demands so! The only thing Palestinians want is land, more and more land, Israel’s land. But the funnier concept to me is the way the world thinks. They say to Israel, “Give them the land they ask for, and they will stop all the terror”. And has Israel done that? On more than one occasion… That’s all Israel is doing really, they keep on giving more and more land, following the pressure of US (Clintons administration strongly supported “Land for Peace” plan), as well as other countries in the UN. Has the violence stopped? No! And It Will Not Stop.<P>I think that Ariel Sharon is doing that Israel should have done long, long ago. They are simply defending the land that is rightfully their, they are defending its people. They have put up with the rest of the world for far too long, they have listened to other countries’ opinions and advice for too long, so far it has not brought any resolutions, and as Sukar pointed out, that history shows it doubtfully will. “Resolution to a military discord is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin.  Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.” (Sun Tzu – The Art of War) And things have been neglected for far too long. Israel should fight back for what is rightfully theirs. There simply is no simple or peaceful solution… In the hegemonic political system that exists in the world today US has a major say on things, Bush seems to want to support Israeli will to defend itself, but the pressure from the Senate and the UN seems to outweigh  his opinion…    <IMG SRC="confused.gif" border="0"> <P>It's all rather sad...<P>--------------------<P><B>Xroft Thunderbringer</B> - <A HREF="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Xroft" TARGET=_blank> Profile </A><BR>Arch Mage,<A HREF="http://www.drow.org" TARGET=_blank> Blood of the Spider </A>

All you do is give a one-side iteration of the Israeli position Xroft.  You speak of how Israel is right, and Sharon is right, and who the U.S. should support and everything but tell me, will that get Israel any closer to ending the conflict it has with all Arabs everywhere?  Sorry, but the answer remains no.  Great, so Israel crushes the woefully outmatched Palestinians and permanently annexes the occupied territories.  Will that end the conflict between Israel and the Arabs?  Heh, if anything, it will just make it worse.  So what next.  Another Israel vs Middle East war?  Go annex Lebanon?  Syria next?  Iran next?  Would the world sit around and let Israel start annexing Oilsville 'to defend itself'?  Hardly.  Thus the point again, is frankly, who is right or wrong no longer matters.  All that matters is a solution.<P>Further, you fail to explain why an international solution isn't viable.  You speak of how this conflict has been ongoing for over half a century as if that means it will never be resolved.  This is my point exactly.  If you leave two brats to beat each other up, their hostility will probably never be resolved, but if you yank them into the principal's office, it either gets resolved, or whoever prolongs the conflict suffers the ultimate penalty.  In other words, part of the reason the Middle Eastern conflict has lasted as long as it has is because the international community has left it in the hands of these two bitter enemies to solve, which is impossible.  The only solution is for the international community to step in, like the principal, and solve it by force.  Tell me - has this ever been tried since 1947?<P>The idea here is not for the international community to merely demand peace, but to implement peace by force, which we all know will be necessary, but perhaps not.  It is the only solution short of just throwing in the towel and just settling it by World War III, which is the way this is shaping to go.<P>The United States should get with NATO, Russia, China and Japan, using the UN as the vehicle, and come up with a solution which they will all commit to defend by the utmost force if necessary.  If the Arabs wish to defy this solution, they will no longer be simply defying Israel, they will be defying the world.  To me, this looks like a good place for Israel to be, regardless if Israel is not entirely happy with the solution itself.  This way, a solution is implemented, terrorism is not rewarded, and the stakes for violence in the Middle East rise to the point where the violators must answer to the collective economic and/or military force of the world.  Most importantly for me personally, the conflict converts from Israel/US vs Middle Eastern terrorists to Violators of Peace Plan vs World.  If we could ever get to this point, perhaps I could sleep just a tad easier living a half mile from the Pentagon and riding around Washington DC subways every day.<P>So again I ask, why isn't this happening?  Perhaps, as the author above suggests, it is because the world just doesn't have the will for it.<P>"Since the parties cannot negotiate secure borders, as Resolution 242 of 1967 asked them to, why not have world powers—the “quartet”, say, of America, the UN, the European Union and Russia—map out such borders for them, and set a deadline for Palestinian independence? None of this would help a jot unless those powers, and especially the superpower, put sustained pressure on both sides to comply. But how disgraceful it would be if the answer to those “why nots?” was that the world at large, while calling piously for both sides to see reason, simply lacked the will to save them from each other."<p>[ April 24, 2002: Message edited by: Lizard ]<P>--------------------<P>Scaled, for her pleasure<BR><A HREF="http://drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Sssorn" TARGET=_blank>Profile</A> | <A HREF="http://www.drow.org/news.shtml" TARGET=_blank>BotS</A>

There can be no piece in Israel or Palestine using diplomatic measures.<P>You are either: a) Islamic or b) an enemy of Islam.<P>Palestinians (as well as other Islamic nations) see Jews as infidels on holy land. Giving them sovereignty will do nothing but provide another safe haven for terrorists.<P>Simply put, Palestinians want Jews *GONE*. They don't want to share land with them, they don't want to co-exist in any way, shape or form. They simply want them *GONE* and suicide bombing will not stop until they're gone, I don't care what sanctions or mandates are made. And putting an impotent 'armed' UN force there isn't going to stop it either.<P>The fact is, Israel is the buffer between the middle east and the west. Israel suffers the most terrorism, by far, than any other country. If Palestinians ever managed to get their way, which is of course, to get rid of Israel, guess what country would be next on the Islamic agenda?  Yeah, us!<P>This is why we equipped Israel to the point that we have.<P>Want to stop Islamic-sponsored terrorism? Wipe the fuckers out.

I was scrolling down reading all the posts and was about to do a large reply but...Dr. Delete summed it up rather nicely.<P>We need to remove them from the Earth.<P>If I am interpreting this correctly...Sssorn basically your peace proposal will acknowledge both sides as neither right nor wrong and it will be the World not Israel or Palestine who punishes one another if they don't follow your plans rules. <P>Basically, Palestine will break the rules and all the other Islamic states. Now to my question, is it your hope that with this plan once they break the rules we will have the go ahead of just wiping the fuckers out? Unfortunately with politics and all we can't wipe them out now. We need a greater reason i.e. a nuclear bomb explodes in Washington before we can wipe these little rag heads out. Maybe Sssorn's plan with a little Islamic militism to spark it off after it has been initiated will give us the go-ahead we need?<P>We are going to eventually destroy the Middle-Eastern Islamic states. I purely think it's a matter of when.<p>[ April 25, 2002: Message edited by: happymonk ]<P>--------------------<P>Always Faithful<BR>LEEZARDZ 4 ever!<BR>Team  DAoC<BR>"That which does not kill us, makes us stronger."

Well that is exactly right.  My personal opinion is that the only solution that would work is the one the author suggests, except on steroids.  I.e., not merely applying economic and political pressure for both sides to settle, but to offer a simple ultimatum that it is either this way or the proverbial highway to hell.<P>The point is, by offering this solution, the world will come across as quite neutral.  This will help ease the hatred Arabs increasingly feel toward the U.S. since it will be an indication that the U.S. is prepared to be neutral in order to find a solution with the rest of the world.  This will be good for guys like me sleeping at night.<P>But the lovely thing about this solution is what it would eventually expose.  The world would offer the Palestinians a fair solution, commensurate with Oslo.  The Arabs would briefly appreciate the solution in that it would reign in Israeli autonomy in this crisis, and thus indirectly slap the powerful Israelis in the face in doing so.  But as Docs indicates, we all know what would eventually happen.  Since yes, the Arabs want Israel *GONE*, it would be the Arabs who would breach, not Israel.  Breach would come in the form of further acts of terrorism.  Once this would happen, and we all know it would, then the world would invoke the remedy clause in the solution.  Aside from conducting hard core military operations akin to what the Israelis conducted this past month in the occupied territories, the world would align itself economically and politically against whoever the perpetrators are, and if they failed to submit, much like the Taliban failed to submit, said country would find itself going the way of the Taliban as well.  And so on and so forth until probably yeah, the entire Middle East would have an entirely new landscape after the dust settled.<P>Sounds like the way to go.  It is fair, and it gives everyone a chance for peace.  But does the world have the will for it?  I hope so, because as you mention, we are going to have to do this the hard way at some point anyway.<P>As a side note, I would suggest not publicly using terms like "rag heads."  Timothy McVeigh was white, so does that make all of us trailer trash?  Militant muslims are about as representative of all of Islam as the KKK is representative of all caucasians.  It is lazy to lump all muslims together based upon the actions of a few, and while yes, there is a big problem going on with the use of terrorism by muslim extremists, we should strive to avoid making ignorant generalizations.  But that is another issue really.<P>--------------------<P>Scaled, for her pleasure<BR><A HREF="http://drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Sssorn" TARGET=_blank>Profile</A> | <A HREF="http://www.drow.org/news.shtml" TARGET=_blank>BotS</A>

We're just a buncha guys having a conversation on a gaming site's bulletin board about foreign policy. Yet, we realize the real issue here, and that's that Islamic people are not driven by politics and procedure, but rather by religion. <P>I'm convinced that we have some extremely brilliant people in our government who deal with foreign policy matters for a living. I'm 100% confident that these people, including GWB himself, all realize exactly what we do. And you know damn well the Israelis do.<P>The fact is, religion has the highest priority in one's thought process, there can be no words or documents of diplomacy that will override that. <P>Even though WE realize this, and the people in power who actually matter also realize this, proper political procedure must take place.<P>The procedure you outlined in this post sounds reasonable enough to me to be a political process in this matter, but the sad truth is that it'll take time.<P>Time will do nothing but allow the 'Nation of Islam' to become even larger and more powerful than they are today. Ultimately, we'll have to face them. <P>Because of the 'politically correct' society us humans have built for ourself in this modern age, many more people will die than otherwise would be necessary.<P>If I had my way, we would already be pumping oil our damn selves from Saudi Arabia's fields.<P>--------------------<P>Dr. Delete, Ph.D.    <A HREF="mailto:doc@drow.org">doc@drow.org</A>   <BR><B>CORE Member</B>, Organization DROW<BR><I>Sponsors of Champion Internet Gaming Teams</I><BR> <A HREF="http://www.drow.org/" TARGET=_blank>http://www.drow.org/</A> <BR> <IMG SRC="http://www.drow.org/images/spid.gif">

Mr. Shammy Pants, the only reason I start threads like this now and then is because I am curious to know what other regular folks like me feel about a topic or an idea.  I want to see what other people have to say so that hopefully everyone can come out with a broader perspective.  <P>The idea here is not to raise a sensitive issue only to have folks like you come over and bash people who might show a lack of sensitivity.  Spare us your judgment, and instead add something constructive here, like explain your thoughts on why the international community, especially the U.S., is not taking a more direct role in solving the crisis in the Middle East, when all signs indicate that the international community, and especially the U.S., is going to get sucked into it the hard way at one point or another anyway.  The USS Cole, the embassy bombings, 9/11 and our war in Afghanistan are all indications of that, and only a fool would think that is the end of it.<p>[ April 26, 2002: Message edited by: Lizard ]<P>--------------------<P>Scaled, for her pleasure<BR><A HREF="http://drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Sssorn" TARGET=_blank>Profile</A> | <A HREF="http://www.drow.org/news.shtml" TARGET=_blank>BotS</A>

I am in the process of writing a thesis, give me time.<P>I apologize if I seemed angry, but it is misdirected anger.  I acknowledge that this is a forum for deliberation but you must understand my perspective.  The "lack of sensitivity" you describe (aka prejudice or bias toward one group) is DESTRUCTIVE.<P>As far as I see this forum is looking at the middle east in terms of what President Bush calls the "axis of evil" (which is rediculous).  We take every incidence from that area and bind it together into one neat and coherant package when there is more to the picture than what most Americans are given through common forms of media.  <P>The reason it is taking me time is because I am researching events and the history of isreal and palestine... unlike some people who cut and paste political rhetoric and add a biased interperitation of events and politics of "those people" or as some people blatently come out as calling "ragheads" *cough*.  Let me take a moment here to say that I am not pro-palestinean nor pro-israel per say; although this statement might come back to haunt me within my later opinions and text.<P>BTW, what do you mean by "one of those people".  I suppose you can consider me to be a gadfly - after all I don't conform to the beliefs of others.  I make judgements for myself based on the understanding that the world is a complex network of people and activity.  <P>More to come.<P>[ April 26, 2002: Message edited by: Xyrloc ]<p>[ April 26, 2002: Message edited by: Xyrloc ]<P>--------------------<P>C'mon Shammy Pants!

make them listen to n'sync for 1 week, they should all be WELL dead by then heh.<P>pakistinians (fuk sp) want isreales dead, isreales are whatever more diplomatic but will not give up the small piece of "holy land".. the question is WHY and yes its already been stated its because of their long long long ago religious dispute between being who being the promised nation and having the holy land w/ the temple.  if you could mem wipe all the mofo's out there problem solved.  is it ever going to happen that you can wipe out all of the fanatics? ... hell no duh, no frickin way to do that and that would only make the problem worse.. more family and race and religious hatred brewed as a result of more death.  i will eat your sh*t the day there is peace in the midwest because bush or any country or un or whatever ain't gonna make it happen... oh i'll toss in licking the fuzz out of toes k?  job security for me foo  <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" border="0"><P>opchu 60 warlord
