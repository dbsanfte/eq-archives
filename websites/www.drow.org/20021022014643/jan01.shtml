Killed Trakanon 38 who coughed up a Donals Breastplate (tba).<br> 				  Wasted our time on Venril Sathir for a few crappy staffs. Did an evening<br>				  of Candyland and got a necro and enchanter robe. Now for your pleasure<br>				  some <a href="eq/misc/hoshkar.shtml">visuals</a>.<br><br>				  <span class="newsdate">January 09, 2001: <a class="newsdude" href="mailto:mistabone@drow.org">mIstabone</a><br><br>                  <span class="news">				  Mother of all updates! 1st of all regarding the last year for BotS/Bod aka<br>				  Guild Drow. We had a very successful year securing a huge list of server<br>				  firsts, completed 35 epic quests, and killed our 100th dragon on Trakanon<br>				  number 27. All in all a great run which will continue into 2001 and into<br>				  our next target game Shadowbane in the future.<br><br>				  In the past month we have been very busy killing Trakanon 28 through 37<br>				  filling our bank with more worthless BP's waiting on the illusive Donals<br>				  to drop. Ventured into Veeshans peek killing Silverwing twice and became<br>				  the 6th guild to kill Hoshkar. We've plundered the sissy newbie dragons<br>				  in Western Wastes, killed Gorenaire 2 and 3 and Talendor 2 through 5.<br>				  We have also pillaged the Plane of Growth and whacked several Venril<br>				  Sather's as well as completing 10+ epic quests. Now for your pleasure a<br>				  selection of visuals that won't be rivaled for some time. First our <br>				  plundering of Candyland aka <a href="eq/misc/pog.shtml">Plane of Growth</a>. Later another update<br><br>
