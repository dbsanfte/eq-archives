<span class="news">Solid couple of days for the EQ crew. Wendsday we almost had a flawless victory vs The Dain a total of one death. Sorow :~(?<br><br>
Thursday we started off killing Klandicar for another Sleepers key. Moved on to DN and found Vaniki up for another quick Willsapper. We then moved down to Zlandicar
for another Sleepers key. Hearing about the emergency patch on Friday we quickly mobilized to Fear and owned Cazic 2.0 for the 5th time. More Sleepers exploration as well since last update getting a few more Priceless weapons.<br><br>
Good luck to Flinto in the Shaman BotB this weekend hopefully he can tack a few points onto BotS already impressive 7th place ranking in BotB events. Just a few pics this time <a href="eq/misc/march30.shtml">around</a>.<br><br>

<span class="news">After waiting 8 months 23 days 12 hours 12 minutes and 54 seconds, Dravin finally completed his wizard epic. Congrats!<br>
<br>
On Friday our very own Caveman, Flinto, won the Shaman BOTB defeating Finris and making Hawken a little richer, congrats! Also we spent the majority of the evening in Veeshan's Hell slaughtering the horde of see invis Guardian Wurms that felt the need to split into 12367749 other Guardian Wurms. Oh, we killed a dragon or two also. Be sure to ask Emil how much fun he had there this weekend! <br>
<br>
Monday saw the death of Zlandicar this time with only one or two linkdeaths, as opposed to the standard 34 out of 36 linkdead. Thank you for finally splitting Rathe!<br>
<br>
Oh yea, we killed Innorschmuck tonight, what a <b>joke</b> of a god... Same drill, its all <a href="eq/march/march27.shtml">here</a>.<br>

<span class="news">A lot has happened the past few days... a small group was sent into Sleeper's to get a feel for the zone and Mista came out with a new toy.<br>
<br>
Cazic was killed late Tuesday before the godsend server split, and again on Wedensday. Fun encounters, nice loot. Can't ask for much else.<br>
<br>
Klandicar was killed Tuesday after Cazic for another talisman, and again last night. Unfortunely, still a trillion more to go. Why can't he be twenty-four hours?<br>
<br>
After having the Dain poof last week, he was scheduled for a nice beating (which he gave and then recieved) last night as well. <br>
<br>
Plenty more things to do this weekend, but in the meantime here are the screenshots and <a href="eq/march/march23.shtml">loot</a>.

<span class="news">I've been hounded all day, so here it is.<br>
<br>
Friday was busy: two dragons, a god, and a fish for giggles. Someone noticed Kelorak`Whatever was up in Cobalt Scar so we figured we might as well kill him since we were headed towards Klandicar. Fun warm up.<br>
<br>
Next target was Klandicar which turned into a nice perfect run. He get's easier and easier. Z<b>LD</b>andicar is another story, but it's getting better.  Afterwards, Emil completed the key to Jaled's tomb. Reluctantly he handed in his Talisman and wept, completing his Sleeper's key. <br>
<br>
After the dragon slayings, a god needed to die. It had been forever and a day since I last saw Cazic, so the <i>improved</i> god was refreshing to see. Thanks to the people that neglected sleep, Cazic fell. Very long day which ended nicely.<br>
<br>
Screenshots and stuff <a href="eq/zlan/zlan318.shtml">here</a>.

<br>
<span class="news">After spending the majority of the weekend killing dragons, how do you start the new week? <br>
<br>
By killing even more dragons of course! On the menu for Sunday was Klandicar the cross-dresser. With relative ease this elder dragon's final wish was fullied, as his remains now rest within the Necrapolis.<br>
<br>
But that's not all! The cannibal Zlandicar was the next of the first brood to fall. Despite a few problems here and there, his dragon eating days are over. You can expect many... many... many more updates like this. Three sleepers talismen down, way to many left to go.<br>
<br>
You know the drill, it's all *broken, will be fixed tonight*.

<span class="news">Truly an amazing week for all of us. First off, the Dain. He's dead. I love this little guy he can take a give a lot of abuse, but of course he still dies. <br>
<br>
Second, Aegeis. Once again our local paladin made us proud, becoming the winner of The Rathe server Paladin competition. Grats Aeg!<br>
<br>
And finally... Veeshan's Peak. On Saturday the Ring of Scale was beaten. Silverwing dropped faster than a fire beetle. Hoshkar held his own but of course he finally fell. Xygoz is a gimp. Next came Nexona, she brought a friend and charmed yours truly... didn't help her much. Druushk, being a ranger-druid wannabe, died like one. Finally, Phara.<br>
<br>
Of the Kunark challenges, Phara is one of the more interesting. Some call the fight against her intense, others mind numbingly boring. This dragon has a few tricks up her sleeve all of them being annoying. Regardless she's dead. Veeshan's Peak is cleared. The lewts were very phat.<br>

<span class="news">The week started slow with a few things done here and there, but it ended perfectly.<br>
<br> 
We got a taste of our <b>first</b> quad 425 Dain. He's brutal, very brutal. He of course died. This was a tough fight, he was greased up nicely well by his Servant Girl. I believe this is only the second time he's been killed since heal-agro nerf in this form.
<br>
<br>
Now if you play on The Rathe, you know it's not very stable. So, as you guessed it, we got <b>another</b> Dain Sunday evening, followed by a quick trip to Lord Doljonijiarnimorinar to appease our restless monkies.<br>
<br>
I don't think the week could of ended any better.. Be sure to check out the <a href="eq/dain/dain35.shtml"> visuals</a>. <br>
