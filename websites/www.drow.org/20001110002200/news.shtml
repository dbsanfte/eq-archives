                  up-to-date than our old site.<br><br>
                  First off, this site looks like absolute shit in anything but IE5.<br><br>
                  Site TODO list: Fix netscape CSS, finish about/join pages, finish news<br>
                  management tool, bug Emil to finish Members/Roster section, setup the<br>
                  archives area which is to be sort of a visual gallery of DROW's<br>
                  competative past, setup our own message boards so we don't have to<br>
                  link to slow ass ezboard, finish files section, links section, add<br>
                  the Q3 servers to the servers list and a brief FAQ about our servers,<br>
                  add a link somewhere for DROW's language terms.<br><br>
                  ALSO, I need to finish the whole right column which is currently not<br>
                  displayed at all. The right column includes a cool poll each week.<br>
