<h2>Story unfolds: More killings, vandalism and a kidnapping</h2><br>

<b>Reporter Willaen:</b> After a recent and public broadcasted interview with Veeshan, chief of the Veeshan Police Department, it seems that the serial killers made no attempt to stop their carnage. Monday marked another day of serial killings.
<br>

<br>
<b>W:</b> Brutal slayings occurred for Vulak`Aerr and Lord Vyemm. They were the last 2 survivors of the weekend it seems, but their fate was in the hands of a horde of evil that didn’t think highly of their scaley skin. I have Veeshan here once again and he will finish the update for you.
<br>

<br>
<b>Veeshan:</b> Ladies and Gentlemen thank you for your eyes. I have been in charge to update today and I hope it’s a very informative session. Monday as you know was very hard on me EH`. I lost my best officers once again, Lord Vyemm and Vulak`Aerr, to the suspected organization BotS. Here is a photo that was sent in from an anonymous recipient and we figure it’s from them. <pic>
<br><br>

<div align=center><IMG src="eq/fun/vulakgestapo.jpg" border=1></div>

<br>
<b>V:</b> Rubbing it in our faces won’t get you anywhere. Why don’t you un-mosaic the faces huh? Ya scared? EH`!? Whoever is responsible for these murders, YOU WILL PAY SOON ENOUGH.
<br>

<br>
<b>V:</b> Another sad incident has occured on Monday. One of Vulak’s loyal bodyguards, Charlie the Kung-Fu Monkey, has been kidnapped. This photo was taken during his training, 4 hours before his shift started. If you have any information on whereabouts of Charlie please give Veeshan Police a call.
<br><br>

<div align=center><IMG src="eq/fun/charlie.jpg" border=1></div>

<br>
<b>W:</b> That was a great monkey.
<br>

<br>
<b>V:</b> Aye it was
<br>

<br>
<b>V:</b> So the scoreboard lights up, Serial Killers 2 - Vulak 0. We will find you all and justice shall be brought forth. That is all, thank you for your time.
<br>

<br>
<b>W:</b> Thank you Veeshan for your patience and I’m sure you will get everything situated in the next few days. The other dragon slain was Lord Yelinak, he went down twice within these 3 days probably by the same serial killers that have been unleashing hell in NTOV.
<br>

<br>
<b>W:</b> To lighten things up, on Tuesday, Derakor the Vindicator and Statue of Rallos Zek was assassinated by BotS. Derakor dropped some boots for the ever so loving Daach. Statue dropped a Cloak of Falling Stars for Chatterbox Sssorn ~.~,  a Breastplate of Eradication to Tankish, an Iron Scroll of War to Laddy, and a Hammer of Battle to the famed, Target. That scum of a god Cazic Thule was taken down, rather quickly and it seems BotS was behind that as well. This guild is very generous in killing the Gods we hate and killing the important giants that tend to hurt wurm-kind, so I really don’t know how they would be involved in these mass murders. Only time will tell.

<h1>Serial killing spurs upon NTOV</h1>
<br>
What seemed to be a nice neighborhood for dragons, NTOV has now moved up to spot #1 on the "Most Dangerous Places to Live If You Are a Dragon." According to the Veeshan Police Department, there have been numerous accounts of serial killing going on in the past weeks. In order to get the most precise details, I, Reporter Willaen, have interviewed Veeshan, Chief of Police.
<br>

<br>
<b>W:</b> "Veeshan, who do you think is behind these malicious acts?"
<br>

<br>
<b>V:</b> "I and the department are suspecting BotS, but we can't be for sure until we get some hard evidence, EH`. Whoever it is, they are very smart at cleaning up. No evidence what'sooo'ever.
<br>

<br>
<b>W:</b> "Why do you suspect BotS? Aren't they a legit corporation that is always giving to charity"
<br>

<br>
<b>V:</b> "Ho ho ho! You are blind as a gnoll pup my friend. Do you know who is BotS's CEO?
<br>

<br>
<b>W:</b> "Why yes, Mistabone"
<br>

<br>
<b>V:</b> "YES!  But that is his alias. You see, Mistabone was born Guiddo N. Natty. Guiddo has been inter-twined with the Freeport mob since he was 12 years old. Yes, there is a good side to BotS, but there is also a very evil side. We suspect the evil side to be involved in the serial killings of my fellow dragons. Oh, right here is his profile shot. Just look at it EH` and tell me behind those eyes you can't see "I'm a KILLER" engraved onto his brain.<br><br>
<div align=center><IMG src="eq/fun/mistafront.jpg" border=1> <IMG src="eq/fun/mistaside.jpg" border=1></div><br>

<br>
<b>W:</b> "Tell me Veeshan, what was your first reaction on the first serial killing last week?"
<br>

<br>
<b>V:</b> "When I first heard aboot it, I was going to come down to TOV myself and handle the situation but by the time I got ready to unleash my fury, it seemed as though the killing was done."
<br>

<br>
<b>W:</b> "And how about the second time the killings happened that started just two days ago, why didn't you retaliate?"
<br>

<br>
<b>V:</b> "I had my pants down on that one. I was busy giving my officers a lesson on how to detect blood in their colon."
<br>

<br>
<b>W:</b> "..."
<br>

<br>
<b>W:</b> "Have you found any clues or anything unusual on the bodies of the victims?"
<br>

<br>
<b>V:</b> "Well we have found oout that my good friend Lady Mir was in fact tortured and not just immediately slaughtered. We found traces of the technique, Gnome-Ling. If you don't know, Gnome-Ling is a certain way to choke the victim. What the killers did, was they catapulted a random gnome or halfling into the unaware mouth, in this case 2 gnomes and 1 halfing, and the random catapultee gets stuck and lodged into the victims throat thus leading to the suffocation of a dragon. Ya know? There has also been a few decapitations which is not very fun to clean up since most of the time we can't find the heads. We beleive the heads are kept by a certain BotS member named Deciderius. For some reason he likes everything he touches. Here are the pics of my close friends.<br><br>
<div align=center>The Gnome-Ling Technique:<br>
<IMG src="eq/fun/gnomeling.jpg" border=1></div><br><br>
<div align=center>Another Decapitation:<br>
<IMG src="eq/tovnorth/082601-lordkreizenndead.jpg" border=1></div><br>

<br>
<b>W:</b> "Wait, in the decapitation picture there is a cute gnome, who is that? Is she a suspect?"
<br>

<br>
<b>V:</b> "Nooooooo no no, That's Momma Gnome, one of our very close non-wurmkind friends. She is ally to us and I think she was just running to Lord Kreizenn to stop the bleeding, but unfotunately she was too late to save him. See you next week Kreizenn my friend..."
<br>

<br>
<b>W:</b> "Well thank you for your time Chief Veeshan, I hope you do find the organization who is killing your friends left and right and may Tunare punish them will all her might."
<br>

<br>
<b>V:</b> "EH`?"
<br>

<br>
<b>W:</b> "Forget it"
<br>

<br>
There you have it folks, from what is to be a wonderful organization, BotS turns out to be the lead suspect in the serial killings of the innocent protectors of NTOV. More to come in a few days as the story unfolds.

Hello! Just a quick update on the goings on of the Clan Drow AO team. We have currently reached membership of around 45 members. The roster page which is almost finished will be posted very shortly.<br>
<br>
I would also like to take this time to congratulate Lodizal who reached level 100 just the other day. He is one of the few in Rubi-Ka who have achieved this mark.<br>
<br>
Many of the players on the AO team are levels 50+, and most all are above 30+.<br>
<br>
I would also like to thank the recently promoted officers, Shadoknight, Sparco, Arabis and Nexona, whom have proven themselves to be a great help in the forming and recruiting for Clan Drow's AO team. Thanks guys. <br>
<br>
The team is currently working on progressing in levels as a focal point at the present time. However in the very near future, Clan Drow will be unleashing its ranks into the world of AO PvP. Rubi-Ka will never be the same.<br>
<br>
If you are interested in joining Clan Drow's AO team please make your intentions known over in the <a href="http://www.drow.org/forums/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?category=9">forums</a>.<br>
<br>
Since it is most likely Shadowbane will not be out till end of summer 2002 or later, I personally will be focusing most of my energy making Clan Drow's AO team as successfull as every other fine team Drow has unleashed unto the gaming world.<br>

            two rancors attacking us. That really didn't stop of from taking PD down. She fell quick, along with her poosae, wannabe
            bodyguards. PD dropped a Crown of Rile for Samadhi, Shield of the Elders went to Noel and the Claw of Phara Dar went to Blaal. After that we dropped down to WW and killed
            Klandicar with zero deaths. GG Ayato on Sleepers Key.</P></td>

            Deciderius got a new Helm of the Crawler, Finris was awarded new pajamas called Onyx Chain Leggings and Seolta received Sprinkler of the Spirits.
            Lady Nevederia was the last dragon for the night and she dropped a Cloak of Thorns for Tsigo and Nevederia's Left Eye for Garreth.</P></td>

            Zlexak went down and dropped a Windraider Belt for Nadart and an Orb of Spinning Confusion for Valerine. I'm not going to bother to mention the UBER loot Cekenar dropped, but GG Mithson on your new axe.
            While clearing to kill another dragon we ran into some named drakes that dropped a Ring of Superiority which went to Veness and a Shield of Thorns that went to Kayluss.</P>

            a Robe of Inspiration to Xilt. The dorf Dain didn't last too long since we had a good attendance. Tri-Plated Golden Hackle Hammers went to Tikkon and Garrm and grats Garreth on your new Belt of Dwarf Slaying. After Dain, Yelinak was due for a slaying. Yeli dropped his head of course which went to Finris.
            Other loot consisted of a Dragon's Blood Earring that went to Tankish, Sleepers Key for Mithson and the pally sword Craslith was awarded to Target since he needs to attain less aggro.</P>
