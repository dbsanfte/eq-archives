<LI>Don't get into a personal fight over /ooc /shout or /guild..Save it for tells....If it gets out of hand /ignore..or tell an officer
<LI>Don't curse...We have many children of guildies that play. Lets not corrupt them more than their parents..lol
<LI>NO dwarf throwing..our guild dwarf would get offended...and he is a Dwarf not a Dorf
<LI>Elderbanc is a community chest. She holds our money and items. You may withdraw from her as long as you are willing to deposit. Better to have a guildie use something rather than sell it. 
<LI>Try to do things yourself before asking for help. We have no problem with helping out. Attempt to walk someplace yourself.. of course, it is ok to ask if anyone is available for a ride, but remember they have the right to say no..
<LI>If someone needs help and you can help, don't ignore them.. Try to help if you can..if you can't, that's ok too.
<LI>This is a learning guild. Many members are new to the game and are just learning. BE PATIENT. There are also MANY members that know this game well...
<LI>NO political/religious discussions. No good can come of it..only hurt feelings.
<LI>NO KILL STEALING
<LI>Reputation is everything. You are wearing our guild tag. Anything you do or say will effect the entire guild. Good reputation is what will get us invited to multi guild raids later if we are considered an reputable guild.
<LI>If CoE helps you get an item money or raid you are required to hand down the item.
<LI>You can not sponsor a person if you already have sponsored someone that is in 2 wk probation.
<LI>If you are farming a camp for items and you can not get exp off it. You must relinquish the camp when an exp group comes along. Does not count for other farm group. Exceptions are gear you will USE, guild gems, and epic items. 
<LI>We do not invite anyone under the age of 18. CoE is an adult/family guild.
