So you have chosen the one true path...</FONT></I>

<P>While this guide will be coming from a darkelf&nbsp; stand point it
should/could be applied to any race. I will break it into a few different
sections. Also would like to take this time to point out that this was
my first character created, so they are sure to be&nbsp; faster ways to
level or make cash. As I said this was my way. Shall we?

<P>First lets look into the very beginning.. Being a darkelf we are very
agile yet fairly weak, with this said at char creation I would max out
my Strength and add the rest to Dexterity or Agility. Too bad I didn't&nbsp;
realize this when I started.

<P>For my first 10 levels I never left Nek forest. Again I wish I would
have moved into East Commons at about lv 5, but hey we all live and learn.
I fought beetles and Snakes in Nek forest for the <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/quests/default.asp?mode=35&id=61400">Snake
fangs</A> {Quest Item} and <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/quests/default.asp?mode=35&id=67496">beetle
eyes</A> {Quest Item}. These two quests took me to lv 5 in about 3 hours.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>After Lv 5 I begin to learn the advantages of grouping, our first group
of 5 made our way to the Halfling Ring on the newbie side of the bridge.
We began to learn quickly about bad pulls and NPC casters. Eventually we
managed to break the camp and had them spawning 1 at a time. The loot was
decent for the lv especially the Amulets {Quest Item}. The Amulets and
the occasional skeleton took us to Level 7 in no time. For my next 2 levels
I&nbsp; moved from the Halflings to the Pyramid {Wizard port}. Taking out
the skeletons and the occasional zombie, although I was still unable to
take out the mummy. If he popped I would just shout that there was a mummy
at the following&nbsp; /loc and in no time it would be dispatched. At lv
9 i was no more of a weak warrior, I got my first spells, and my first
taste of what was to come. So now I have my first set of spells, and very
little in the form of equipment. If I remember correctly I had patchwork
at this time, I found that if you make the right friends you can get things
at cost a lot of the time. By this I mean, I would get the supplies for
the armor and a friend would make it if i bought the pattern. So that saved
me a lot, I changed locations to what I call the monolith, is a ruin across
the newbie bridge next to the East Common Zone. There I kept on killing
skeletons and the occasional Young Kodak that conned yellow or white, this
took me to level 10 in no time.

<P>Now from Level 10 you can begin to adventure a small bit, BUT as I said
this is what I did. This next part is Boring as hell, but I was the only
SK I knew that had a full suit of Banded Armor that I had bought all for
my self with no help by level 14. This next section is designed to take
you to level 20 without leaving a 2 island spread.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>First go back to the bank and get all the bone chips you have { I had
about 20 stacks}, then go back to the forest and&nbsp; /Auction WTS Bone
chips 2PP/Stack 20 stacks to sell, Buy 19 get one free!!&nbsp; Bam 38PP
in about 45 sec. High lv Shadow Knights and Necros&nbsp; will gobble these
up . I already had to 8 slot back packs but I went and bought 6 more then
I went and bought 2 stacks of water/Bread (this was prior to the food patch
which made some food last longer then others). I proceeded to the ruins
and acquired another stack of bone chips for my pet spell by this time
I was 1/2 the way to Level 11. A friend had mentioned that a guild mate
of his had told him of this island that had much wealth for us to uncover.
I was game..&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>So we set off for Freeport and he binded me on the docks and off we
went . As we were riding the boat from Freeport we were talking about what
we were in for, as neither of us had ever left Nek Forest. After the zone
he said we were to jump ship at the first island on the right we saw, well
before it docked. After the long swim to the island we found a small spot
next to the water and prepared our camp. Casting my pet spell and him doing
the same , we scoped out our first target, a Sister od Ellorsii &lt;SP>.
She was a tough opponent but the loot was well worth it. Being lv 10 and
having a Lv 11 necro we were able to take 2 maybe 3 before we needed to
rest. With each kill we received a Purity Belt which had some decent stats
for the lv and sold for a whopping 1.8PP!! After filling all the bags we
swim out to the boat and entered it through the secret hole in the bow.
after a LONG ride back we deiced to try something on the next trip. ( Long
story short we ran all the way back to Nek to sell). On the next trip I
made an enchanter and put all points into Chr. took him to the island and
camped him there. We repeated out process and instead of traveling back
we passed all the bag to this mule char and sold right there on the island.
I had a guild by then and had some guild members drop me off some food/binechips
when needed and stayed here till lv 14 by this time I had maybe 100PP as
did my Duo Partner. Bought my set of banded all at once and got a steal
of a deal on a frozen long sword 15Plat. By the level of 18 I was really
getting bored with the sister bashing but had acquired about 50PP more.
We were told of gargoyles one island over which had a uncommon loot of
a Gargoyle Eye which was stackable and sold for 9PP each so we hit them
for about 2 levels and only got maybe 10 eyes the entire time. So by now
were both lv 20 and have about 150PP each.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>We deiced to travel a bit we move to the Kunark Land mass and end up
in a zone called Overthere. OT is broken up into two areas, a noob area
and a Kick your ass area. When facing the bank to the left is the noob
area. Exp there was great and loot was decent, but a guild mate of mine
said once I hit lv 22 to move to South Karena and look up a treant group.
So I was curious where to go at 20 and deiced I would work on my faction
some at High Pass after two levels in high pass and a Rare drop I was no
longer KOS to the guards and could bank there. (rare drop being the Sharlock
Pack which is a weight reduction bag) At lv 22 I moved to SK and looked
into this treant group, the Loot was CRAZY average 6PP per kill and two
pop at once. A good group could take the spawn no problem. I begin to save
my money and buy my Fine steel armor piece by piece.. some nights I would
get two. I would average about 75PP per night here. After about 6 Levels
I had a full suit of Fine steel, and the best part was that I had earned
it all myself. At lv 28 I went back to OT and got into a beat your ass
group and was getting exp like crazy. When I couldn't find a group there
I would goto Lake of Ill Omen and solo some sarnaks there. This took me
to lv 30 with no problem.

<P>Now for the later levels.. I will leave that for you to deiced, currently
lv 41 I have enjoyed my SK like no other.

<P>As I stated in the beginning im sure there are faster ways but this
is how it was done by this Shadow Knight, hope it helps you acquire what
you will.<BR>
