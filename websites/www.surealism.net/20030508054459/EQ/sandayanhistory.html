<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>Raised in Nektulos Forest
I always believed I was meant for some greater purpose in life.</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>It wasn't until I had to make
a trip to the city that I realized my calling soon to come.</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>On my way to the city I saw
the most vile of all creatures, a creature whose stench poisoned the air
in which we breathed,</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>these so called halflings
violated our forest driving away all its virture.&nbsp; As I looked upon
this creature my blood began to boil,</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>it was as if an unknown force
merged with my soul all that I knew at the moment was to destroy.</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>Surprisingly I killed the
halfling with very little effort, as it's blood stained corpse laid below
my feet I was entranced by it.</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>The sight of its blood covered
on my dagger, what thrill it would be to kill another I thought to myself.</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>Still there was something
missing the death of this being was to quik, if only to torture it a little
longer,</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>to raise its spirit from its
corpse and to have it become my slave to obey my every whim.</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>At last I found my destiny,
I shall train at the lodge of the dead and become a knight of death.</FONT></FONT></CENTER>
