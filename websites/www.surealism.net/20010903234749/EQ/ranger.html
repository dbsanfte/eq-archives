Ranger is considered by many to be one of the most under powered classes
out there and with some of the limitation they have, one can understand
why. Unlike the other hybrids Rangers do not get the benefit of a "Once-a-Day"
skill, they can not wear plate and their defense is the lowest of all the
hybrids. On the other hand, Rangers are the only hybrid class that can
duel wield and our spell list is better then any other hybrid class out
there as well as the Rangers ability to hit critical with a bow. The travel
ability of a Ranger is also unsurpassed by all melee classes (except maybe
the bard), we have the ability to cast Spirit of the Wolf (increased movement
spell) and camouflage, not to mention that we can pass most animals without
the worry of being attacked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A player should keep all this in mind when deciding
to play a Ranger, because the Ranger can be a very difficult class to play
but can also be a very rewarding one when all is said and done. As with
any class, a player new to Ever Quest should read up on all the classes
before choosing one. While some our great at low levels other truly shine
when they reach mid twenties. With a little practice a Ranger can be one
of the best pullers in the game by using the talents that are often taken
for granted, Tracking, Harmony, Snare and their bow and arrows. A&nbsp;
Ranger can pull exactly what he wants and bring it back to his party. Being
part Druid also allows you the ability to cast heal, but your healing powers
are extremely limited and should only be used in case of an emergency or
during down times to save your cleric/shaman/druid some mana. Remember
despite the fact that you have some extremely useful spells you&nbsp; are
a fighter through and through and your place is up close and personal with
whatever mob your party is fighting. A&nbsp; Ranger is geared for melee
combat, the damage out put of the ranger is equal only by that of the warrior
and monk, and your ability to taunt is surpassed by NONE, keep in mind
though that you don't have the hit points to tank and your taunt should
be used only to pull a mob off your casters and healers.

<CENTER>As a Hybrid most of your stats are important in one way or another,
you should prioritize how ever you feel comfortable. One&nbsp; way would
be to build your strength (for damage with your critical hits and weight
allowance), dexterity (your ability to land your attacks and to hit critical
with a bow), agility (to avoid being hit), wisdom (for mana), and stamina
(hit points). However you decide to use your bonus points remember, there
are a ton of&nbsp; stat adjusting items in the world of norrath that can
be obtained to boost a low stat.</CENTER>

<CENTER>Well I hope this has helped some of you out there and that the
other sections of the newbie help will also help you, I know most of the
information here is known by most players already&nbsp; but I didn't want
a total spoiler site. Well anyway this part of the Ranger page is going
to be my personal views and of what I feel would be a Rangers&nbsp; views
of the other classes. Well here goes...</CENTER>

<CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER></CENTER>
<B>Bard - </B>Annoying musicians who sing when they should fight and flee
when the battle finally starts to get good. Worse then Rogues, a Rogue
will steal money and goods and at least you know to distrust a Rogue but
the Bards have spent years manipulating others convincing them they are
friends just to learn their skills. Be weary around this bunch and guard
your family secrets close...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Cleric - </B>Misguided healers of whatever god it is they serve.
Very useful in a fight&nbsp; but other then that what can you say about
a group that follows the path of&nbsp; Tunare &amp; Innorruk except misguided...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Druid - </B>This family makes great allies in any situation, their
spells are extremely useful to us and they share pretty much the same goal
and beliefs that we do. Make&nbsp; friends with as many of them as you
can as in the later years you will need them as much as they will need
us.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Enchanter - </B>A group of finger wigglers that specialize in mind
control, make sure their spells are upon the enemy and not yourself. Not
much to say about them other then toss em a few shinny gems and watch them
drool.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Magician - </B>Another finger wiggler, only this group is a little
mysterious but helpful. I have yet to figure out how they do it but they
always seem to have what you need when you need it. Another thing to note
is that they can summon some pretty nasty elemental pets to help them so
if you have to cross one, make a joke about spending to much time with
their pets and then disappear...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Monk - </B>I have not had the pleasure or desire to meet one of these
yet, but from what I hear they are almost as&nbsp; bad as the Paladin's.
Devoted to mastery of body and mind blah blah blah, if you kill one of
em make sure their dead they have a tendency to appear dead when their
not.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR><B>Necromancer - </B>The opposite of the clerics, these priests of
the dead are an odd group. One of which I have had very little interaction
with and intend to keep it that way if at all possible. They carry a reputation
for being nasty soul stealers, however the one I fought with didn't seem
to be very interested in my soul.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Paladin - </B>They almost have the making of a great class of warrior
but their misguided beliefs in a holy crusade make them one of the worst
groups out there. Obsessed with cleansing the world of evil, but their
quest for peace makes them a greater evil.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR><B>Ranger - </B>Perfection...<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR><B>Rogue - </B>Half thief, half assassin all untrust worthy. While
they are notable fighters and half-way&nbsp; decent scouts their habit
of theft tends to make you wonder&nbsp; how much money that bandit you
just killed really had on it. Use them if&nbsp; you can but never let one
get behind you.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR><B>Shadow Knight - </B>I know only one of these strange class of person.
A knight of death, a very noble warrior who does not try to cover his thirst
for blood up in some kind of quest for greater glory or religious crusade.
If only they weren't so bent on using the world as one big battle field
they might make good allies, but until we convince them to join us in protecting
the Mother's creation then watch your back around them and never let one
touch you.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR><B>Shaman - </B>They have made great allies to us in the past and some
still remain with&nbsp; us to this day, however with the discovery of Kunark
and the Iksar Shaman's&nbsp; there has been some tension in their ranks
and have gone off back to their own lands to assist their pilgrims in the
exploration of Isle of Cabalis.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR><B>Warrior - </B>Really can't say much about these people, they are
as varied as the sands on the beach. Every race and religion, good and
evil has their warriors and each is set in their own ways. Take em or leave
em...<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR><B>Wizard - </B>Finger wigglers with very nasty spells. They come from
all walks of life and all&nbsp; have one desire, the mastery of their craft.
Very dangerous until you cut out their&nbsp; tongue and give it back to
him. Of course even then watch yourself around them, their spells can kill
a man rather quickly if you allow them to cast em.
