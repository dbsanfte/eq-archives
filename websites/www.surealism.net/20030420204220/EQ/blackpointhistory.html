my dad would tell me to, "Stop and smell the roses or everything will pass
you by and no one will ever know of you in this crazy world we call home."&nbsp;
I was very young when he told me that but it has stuck to me my whole life.&nbsp;
My parents had both died by the time i decided to one day leave Qeynos
and venture forth into the world to find my treasure.&nbsp; My father was
always obsessed with finding a rare weapon that could make him the most
feared rogue that ever lived.&nbsp; I had what was left of the notes and
set a foot into the new land.&nbsp; My younger sister, Whitepoint, argued
with me to come back for I had nothing to prove.&nbsp; I guess thats the
difference between a rogue and healer though, I try to change the world
one whole at a time while she tried to change it one person at a time.&nbsp;
We said our farewells and I left.</FONT></FONT></FONT></CENTER>

I ended up with a tall warrior for a lot of my combat training.&nbsp; I
could never swing a sword effectively but i was highly skilled with the
smaller blades.&nbsp; He instructed me early and never lost patience.&nbsp;
Selovare will always be a close friend to me.&nbsp; We practiced on many
of the BlackBurrow Gnolls that run amok in the hills but soon I had surpassed
my teacher.&nbsp; I had graduated to my 10th season and soon was finding
my fathers heritage beginning to flourish inside me.&nbsp; I began to sneak
around a lot more.&nbsp; Stealing from those that were unaware.&nbsp; I
can say I was very sneaky, but foolish.&nbsp; I was caught by a small dwarf
once and he rightfully sent me out of the zone...it was with that incident
I moved away from Qeynos and my sister.&nbsp; I sent her a letter to tell
her I would not be able to return to Qeynos anytime soon but I shall sometime
be back.&nbsp; I said my goodbyes in that letter but never really knew
what would become of my sister.</FONT></FONT></FONT></CENTER>

I traveled far..through freeport, and also across the ocean to Kaladim
and then into Greater Faydark.&nbsp; I knew my half-elven linage would
grant me some sort of acceptance.&nbsp; I enlisted to fight Crushbone orcs
to help the local guild out and it was there I found my traveling companion
Cendarien.&nbsp; He was spunky, arrogant, and kept calling me his "pretty
slave" because i would obey his command when he sent me to attack.&nbsp;
It was odd but somehow we managed to form some sort of alliance and soon
became friends, maybe even more.&nbsp; My patience factor was tried early
on but with enough "glaring" I can now say I fully understand him.&nbsp;
I just wish he would stop whipping me :)</FONT></FONT></FONT></CENTER>

We've traveled the landscape together..his sharp tongue getting us into
trouble and my sharp blade getting us out.&nbsp; His arcane ability has
served its purpose more than once but all in all, I would throw my body
in front of loose arrow for him.&nbsp; Unroguish as that may sound, he
was my best friend and only friend until now.</FONT></FONT></FONT></CENTER>

A group knows as the Shadows of the Ebon Moon granted Cen and I passage
into their fold.&nbsp; Without ever being in a true family enviroment,
I can say the tough rogue exterior I display at times has melted away.&nbsp;
I'm very passive and not as easily startled.&nbsp; I would name names but
I wouldn't want to foget anyone but the guild has been especially helpful
and are always there to talk to.&nbsp; But then again, a rouge is a rogue
and I will never forget my father or his teachings.&nbsp; The Sorrowblade
name must live on.</FONT></FONT></FONT></CENTER>

It wasn't until a recent trip into Felwithe that I found my sister at the
local tavern handing out heals and bandaids to all that had found the wrong
end of an orcs sword.&nbsp; United again, we spent the day talking about
the days past, my life as a rogue, her life as a cleric, gods, orcs, and
Kunark were all mentioned.&nbsp; Everything was fine until a civilian came
into the bar and told us that there were many elves wounded and any help
would be needed.&nbsp; It was then we saw our differences, she was to heal
wounds while I created them...but somehow, it works.&nbsp; Hopefully, we
will once again sit down, Whitepoint, myself, and maybe Cen if he's lucky,
and talk about the past without any interruptions.</FONT></FONT></FONT></CENTER>
