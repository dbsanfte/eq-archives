<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>This story begins many years
ago when i was a small boy, my father had built us a hut outside of Halas.</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>It was late in the evening
and i had just returned from a long day learning how to&nbsp; wield the
spear.</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>So i slept,&nbsp; my father
and mother had left to gather some food for the morrow when a goblin quietly</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>found his way into our home.
He attacked quickly useing a sword slashed me across the face</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>leaving the scar you see today.
It approached and raised its sword for a final blow that would end my life.</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>It never came, before the
goblin could bring the sword down my father had called forth the</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>winds of the north and froze
the goblin. My mother took the creature outside and finished it off.</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>The next day a messenger arrived
at our house the said the orcs where on the war path and would be</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>in our area in a few hours,
my father packed my things and sent me back to Halas with the messenger
where i was</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>taken into the Shaman guild
to keep safe, I was placed in a room with many other children from all
over Ever Frost.</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>I spent days there, and soon
parents started retrieving the other children. The days&nbsp; turned into
months</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>and soon i was the only child
left, finally after 5 months of waiting a messenger arrived and told me
that my</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>parents have been assigned
to an out post deep within Perma Frost and that i can not venture with
them so i must</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>wait here until thier job
there is done. So I waited, another month went by and I became bored and
left the room they</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>had me in, I found rooms that
contained old books and began to read them, they taught of&nbsp; the history
of the Barbarian race,</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>of the seperation of the humans
from us and then the erudites&nbsp; from the humans. I studied all I could
and soon found books</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>containing ancient texts of
magic that where kept only for the select few who the Tribunal deemed worthy
to learn.</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>My trips out became long and
would some times last from first to light to just before the sun set, i
learned all i could and</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>soon I learned all the books
had to offer. Unsatisfied i went to the eldest Shaman and told him of my
secret.&nbsp; The elder</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>listened to him realizing
that I had potential.&nbsp; So he took me under his wing and tought me
the ways of the Shaman..</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>then telling me to go out
and find the answers to the questions in my heart...</FONT></FONT></CENTER>
