<TD>
<CENTER>In a nutshell, the Corpse Recovery rules are as follows<BR>
<BR>
Characters All Levels: If you have no items on your corpse, it will dissapear
within 3 minutes.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
Characters Level 1-5: Corpse will dissapear within 30 minutes (real time)
whether you are online or offline. Those of you wondering why this rule
is in place? - There would be WAY to many bodies if we didn't do it this
way.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
Characters Level 6 and above - Corpse will dissapear within 24 hours if
the player is online (being at the character select screen STILL counts
as online). Corpses will dissapear within 1 week if the player is offline."&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
An additional note to this that you should be aware of is that being online
means being logged into your account, no matter what character you are
playing.&nbsp; Thus, if you have a character die and switch to another
character for 24 hours without looting that first corpse, the corpse will
disappear and you will lose all of your stuff.&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>Learn to Use /assist and /assist &lt;playername>.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
You may want to define a hotkey to /assist.&nbsp; Pick out somone in the
group to be prime target selecter. Everyone target that person and hit
the assist key.&nbsp; This way you will all fight the same mob.&nbsp; If
you group with a tank often, you can define a key to /assist Tankname.&nbsp;
This way you dont even have to select them, which can take valuable seconds
in a heated battle.&nbsp; Also, Whenever you join a group, ask who the
Prime healer and who the secondary healer is, and who the prime tank is.&nbsp;
These jobs are very important, and they can be a lifesaver if you know
to keep the mobs off while the cleric greater heals the tank.&nbsp; Also
in higher level zones, check to see if there is an evac person...and keep
the mobs off if an evac is called.</CENTER>

<TD>
<CENTER>At the text prompt, you can use the SHIFT-UpArrow to view a history
of your previous commands.&nbsp; Just hit Enter again to repeat the command
verbatim, or you can press SHIFT-LeftArrow or RightArrow and edit the command
first. This is useful for repeating auctions or repeating a tell to a friend
who was zoning.</CENTER>

<TD>
<CENTER>The /yell or /y command is a great way to ask for help from those
around you.&nbsp; It tells everyone nearby that you need help and which
direction to go to find you.&nbsp; You should definitely remember it and
may even want to program it into a social button and put it in your hotkeys.

</TD>

<TD>
<CENTER>The cancel magic spell is useful for dispelling harmful spells
cast on group members. However it will cancel the first icon displayed.&nbsp;
If your party members have many buffs, leave the first icon "slot" open
for harmful magic. You can do this by casting a minor buff followed by
the serious buffs. Then you can dispell the minor buff.</CENTER>

</TD>

<TD>
<CENTER>Looking for a sack or other container to store items with your
newbie character, but don't want to purchase one?&nbsp; Most of the quests
that involve getting multiple items for an NPC involve him giving you a
container in which to collect the items.&nbsp; These can usually be used
to store anything, and are essentially free containers which you can get
often right at level 1.</CENTER>

</TD>

<TD>
<CENTER>For classes with the ability to "sneak", when an NPC merchant regards
you&nbsp; less then indifferently, enable sneak before selling or buying
from the merchant to get better prices.&nbsp; (You'll know it's working
when you /con the merchant and they are "indifferent" to you).&nbsp; This
also allows players who couldn't normally deal with an NPC merchant (i.e.
Aviak Merchant in South Karana) to buy and sell from them</CENTER>

<CENTER>If you hold the right-mouse button down or the control key and
press either the left or right movement keys, you slide to the left or
right (normally you would pivot in place). This can provide a safer way

<TD>
<CENTER>As soon as you start your character, go into options and reprogram
your hotkeys to change auto attack from the default "A" key to something
you will never accidentally hit, such as "~".&nbsp; This will prevent you
from accidentally attacking a NPC you are talking to because you forgot
to hit the enter key to bring up the talk screen.</CENTER>

<TD>
<CENTER>You can keep track of the people you enjoyed grouping with by adding
them to your friends list.&nbsp; Type /friend name to add or delete the
person and then /who all friends to see which friends are on line when
you log back on.&nbsp; You can have up to 20 people on your list. (/friend
will tell you who is on the list). This is a good way to remember names
of people you liked and to develop closer friendships.</CENTER>

<TD>
<CENTER>Please use /ooc for out of character statements. Also try and limit
the use of /shout.&nbsp; It is a role playing game.&nbsp; This doesn't
mean saying thee and thou, but it does mean that your character shouldn't
know or talk about the real world, at least not on /shout.</CENTER>

<TD>
<CENTER>Don't play in one view.&nbsp; Get used to the other camera views
and use them when appropriate.&nbsp; Most peoople will prefer to stay in
the first person view most of the game.&nbsp; I know this is how I play.&nbsp;
However, when in a battle, you may want to switch to one of the wider views
where you can see what is happening all around you.&nbsp; The other views
can also help you scout the terrain around you for firends or foes.</CENTER>

</TD>

<TD>
<CENTER>I was amazed to find out that some newbies are playing in windowed
mode.&nbsp; You are missing out on the glory of the game's graphics that
way.&nbsp; This mode is strictly for inventory and other temporary things.&nbsp;
Program all of your useful commands onto your hot keys (you have 36 of
them after all).&nbsp; Then hit F10 once to go to partial full screen mode.&nbsp;
You can move around and fight in this mode and still have access to all
of your commands.&nbsp; There simply is no comparison to experiencing the
game through Full Screen and Windowed modes.&nbsp; Along those lines, you
should optimize your screen size by going to options and setting your screen
size as high as your video card will allow.&nbsp; You will not believe
the difference between the default setting and the higher settings.&nbsp;
Get the most out of the game.</CENTER>
