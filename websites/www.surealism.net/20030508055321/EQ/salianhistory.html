<CENTER>&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>Salian peered&nbsp;
through the dense fog inhalling the cold morning air deep into&nbsp; his
lungs. It had been years since he had been back to his home town, of course
there would be no welcome home dinners and no smileing faces to greet him.
If he was lucky he might find a warm bed and a strong ale in a inn somewhere.
Closeing his eyes breifly he remembers the night he left, the winds had
told his mother of a comming change. Her Druidadic ways had kept her in
touch with the Mother of All and she could often sense things long before
anyone else. My father was a paladin and a true master of the blade, from
my early days as a child I can remember him teaching me how to use the
noble sword, how to wield the savage axe and even how to shred an enemies
armor usening magical claws. I soon learned how to make the sword an extention
of my body, I learned from my mother the ways of a druid how to use what
the mother has given us to survive. The sun had just set and my father
and I had just returned from the market, when we arrived at the house my
mother was frantic and with fever. My father tried to help her rest and
was finally able to get her to sleep, although I do not think she rested
as I still remember hearing her screams late into the night.</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;Hours had passed and
still she did not stop screaming, the pain she was in must have been extream
for my mother&nbsp; was a strong woman who was very close to Tunare. I
even remember curseing Tunare for allowing my mother to suffer. I had finally
started to drift off to sleep&nbsp; when smoke filled my lungs and I awoke&nbsp;
coughing and choking. I ran to my mothers room but she was gone, I heard
my father yelling my name from outside the house and then I heard other
voices off in the distance. Quickly I got out of the house that was now
becomming engulfed in&nbsp; flames, stepping outside I saw them the entire
town must have been there screaming and shouting some in a tounge I had
never heard. My father stood off to side while the mob had my mother tied
to tree by the neck ready to hang her, I screamed but was silenced with
a blow to my head. Everything went blurry and I could hardly hear but my
blood&nbsp; rage was past the point of reason now I ran forward towards
my mother and picked up a sharp rock from&nbsp; off the groud, as I reached
the rope I began to cut&nbsp; and but found a strong arm lift me from the
ground and toss me aside yelling.</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;I could do nother but
watch as the rope around my mothers neck became tight and her breathing
was slowed. She raised her hand and spoke, her voice was so quiet I could
not hear what she said but as I felt the spirit of the wolf enter me I
knew she ment for me to run . I ran. I ran until my legs would no longer
move, the mob had given chase for some time but they where unable to catch
me, I had escaped but my mother had not. Several days later I returned
to my old house to bury my parents, but I could only find my mother corpse
and so I buried her and made a vow to Tunare that I would not rest until
the man who was responsible for my mothers death was brought to justice.
Since that day I have hunted my father, as I will until I see my father
tortued and killed as my mother was.</FONT></FONT></CENTER>
