<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>Ah so you want to hear the
story of Bartel the Cleric, well it starts when I was but a wee lad.</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>My family consisted of only
my father, and three brothers.&nbsp; Our mother was taken by the plague
that swept through years ago.&nbsp; Father didn't speak much about her,
but always referred to her as being a special woman. We lived out in the
mountains roughly half days travel to Kaladim. My father worked in the
fields trying to provide food for all of us, yet sometimes it seemed there
was never enough for all of us.&nbsp; My brothers took to learning the
skills of a warrior to hunt for the family to help bringing food in.&nbsp;
Being I was much younger then them I was often referred to as the runt,
and was always picked on by my older brothers.</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>A day came when my brothers
out of sheer boredom decided to play a prank on me.&nbsp; They had me go
to the city of Kaladim to find morning dew.&nbsp; They said it was needed
for brewing, and can only be found underneath a guard's foot.&nbsp; I was
reluctant into believing them, yet they made it seem very important and
stressed it is something father needed.&nbsp; I took a few things with
me, and set off for the city.&nbsp; It was a long day's journey, but I
eventually made it to the entrance of the city.&nbsp; Now remembering my
brother's words I asked the guards if they would grant me the favor of
lifting their feet.&nbsp; The guard's sneered at me. “Quit wasting my time!”
The guard yelled. “We've received reports of Ogre's near these parts, and
I can't be playing kiddy games with the likes of you.” Not wanting to bother
the guards a whole lot I sat down to eat some bread that I took with me
while trying to figure out what to do next.</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>“ALARM! ALARM!” a guard shouted.&nbsp;
“Ogre's have been spotted a half days travel from here near a farm house.”&nbsp;
Realizing that my home was that distance away I quickly grabbed all of
my things, and made haste to get home.&nbsp; Upon making it home I was
greeted by seeing the house burnt nearly to the ground.&nbsp; Tears swelled
in my eyes, as I ran inside my home to find my family.&nbsp; Blood was
splattered all over the floor.&nbsp; Some of which led a trail to a corner
where I found my brother…bleeding heavily, and faintly breathing.&nbsp;
I cradled his body in my arms trying to re-assure him that help is on the
way.&nbsp; My brother made no notion that he comprehended as to what I
was saying.&nbsp; I closed my eyes, and yelled at the top of my lungs…”Curse
you damn Ogres!”</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>At that very moment as I felt
my brother's life force slipping away I felt my hands tingling.&nbsp; I
was too confused, tired, and angry to even notice my hands had a faint
blue glow to them.&nbsp; My eyes still shut mourning the death of my family
to hear a raspy voice.&nbsp; I quickly opened my eyes to see my brother
barely looking at me.&nbsp; “Bartel” he said followed with a few coughs
of blood spilling from his mouth.&nbsp; “Did you find the morning dew?”
I looked at him in puzzlement. “ Why would you ask me such a thing?”&nbsp;
“You were always naive” he said, “Take care of yourself my brother” and
with that he died with-in my arms.</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>Completely enraged I got up
grabbing one of the swords that my brothers used to use, and ran outside
the door to kill those accursed Ogres. To only to be stopped by a much
older dwarf.&nbsp; “Whoa! what's your hurry there lad?” he said.&nbsp;
“I'm going to go kill those ogre's in the name of my family.”&nbsp; “I
see, but before you go let me see your hands.”&nbsp; “What are you talking
about?” Without even moving the dwarf quickly grabbed my hand, and sliced
it open with a knife. “Oww what in the name of Brell Serilis are you doing,”
I asked.&nbsp; “Be quiet and concentrate on your hand.” He yelled.&nbsp;
With that I thought of my hand which he still held firmly, and how I would
use it to remove some of the smugness off of his face.&nbsp; Yet this time
I noticed the faint blue glow emanating from my hand, along with the tingling
sensation I felt earlier.</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>“There now, that's what I
needed to see.” He said.&nbsp; “What did you need to see?” I asked.&nbsp;
“Look at your hand now young one.” “After he finally let go I snatched
my hand back to see it was completely healed”</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>“Did you know much about your
mother?” he asked, “I knew nothing much of her, other than she was taken
by the plague a time ago.” I said.&nbsp; “Aye you are correct, but do you
know what she used to do?”&nbsp; I pondered on the idea, and relayed I
had no idea.&nbsp; “Your mother was a cleric,” he said.&nbsp; “How did
you know of my mother?” I asked.&nbsp; “Cause I am the one who taught her
how to use her gift of healing”. He said.&nbsp; “ Who are you?” I asked
“My name doesn't make much importance now, but I've been watching your
family to find out which one of you inherited your mothers gift.” “Why
my family? What is the importance of my mother?” I asked. “All questions
will be answered in due time, but for right now I need you to come follow
me.” He said. “What if I don't want to follow you? What if I want to do
this alone?”&nbsp; “Do you want to have your revenge on the ogre's?” I
greedily said yes.&nbsp; “Then follow me young one, and I shall show you
your true path.”</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Architect"><FONT SIZE=+1>“By the way I never caught
your name young one”&nbsp; “My name is Bartel” “Ahh Bartel the Cleric.
Has a nice ring to it don't you think?” I gave him a distant stare, as
we set off back to the city of Kaladim to where my training would begin</FONT></FONT></CENTER>
