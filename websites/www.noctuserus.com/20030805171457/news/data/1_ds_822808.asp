							Drought, Heat Ravage Harvests in Europe

							The Associated Press<br><br><br>KRIFTEL, Germany<p class="nitfp">Fruit farmer Berthold Heil disgustedly plucks a pear - one that ought to be fat and juicy by now but is no bigger than a golf ball. He tosses it aside.</p>
<p class="nitfp">"We're growing table fruit, and no one is going to take something like this. They're too small, and with this drought they aren't going to grow," says Heil, who has 54 acres of apple, pear and plum trees near Kriftel, a town beneath the green slopes of the Taunus Mountains outside Frankfurt.</p>
<p class="nitfp">For Heil and thousands of other European farmers, this is a sour summer. Temperatures that at times have risen into the low 100s and scanty rains have parched fields and orchards in France, Italy, Germany and Austria, causing losses in fruit, grain, sugar beets, canola, soy, sunflowers and crops grown for animal feed.</p>
<p class="nitfp">And the already heavily subsidized farmers can expect little additional government help, officials say.</p>
<p class="nitfp">In some regions, it's the second straight bad year, coming after floods last summer that drowned crops and waterlogged harvests in Germany and countries in eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Up to 80 percent of the current grain crop has been lost in parts of eastern Germany. For the country as a whole, the grain harvest is expected to fall as much as 15 percent from last year's 43.4 million tons, which because of flooding was down nearly 13 percent from 2001.</p>
<p class="nitfp">In France, the Agriculture Ministry says cereal harvests are down 10 percent. Austria's farmers association says this is their worst year since 1975.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Niche products are suffering, too. Southern Italian lemons whose peels are used to produce limoncello liqueur will be off 10 percent to 15 percent.</p>
<p class="nitfp">And the buffalo whose milk is made into gourmet buffalo mozzarella cheese aren't producing like they used to. "The poor beasts are under stress due to the heat," said Guerrino Zirletta, manager of a buffalo mozzarella creamery in the Latina region south of Rome.</p>
<p class="nitfp">In the past, farmers could make up for some of their crop losses through higher prices for what they did harvest. But the agriculture market has been globalized, and apples can come from Argentina or pears from New Zealand. With local shortages offset by imports, consumers aren't expected to see added costs at the grocery store.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Germany's Central Market and Price Reporting Center predicts that overall "produce prices will remain reasonable for consumers in the next months." Prices for a some crops, such as apples, may go up, it says.</p>
<p class="nitfp">"If this had happened in previous decades or centuries, then there would have been serious price increases - there would have been food shortages, especially of bread," Adalbert Kienle, vice general secretary of the German Farmers Union, said on Germany's ARD television.</p>
<p class="nitfp">But because of globalization, he said, producers "are so quick and flexible that consumers notice nothing or very little."</p>
<p class="nitfp">Governments aren't rushing in with more aid. The European Union, which already spends $49 billion a year helping farmers, has no additional funds in its budget, agriculture commissioner Franz Fischler has said.</p>
<p class="nitfp">No EU member has applied for permission to increase aid levels in their national budgets, commission officials say.</p>
<p class="nitfp">France's government is allocating $41 million to help farmers buy hay for livestock and will allow farmers to pay some taxes later.</p>
<p class="nitfp">The EU's executive commission also moved up some of its payments to beef raisers and is considering paying part of the $7.7 billion it doles out annually in grain support money in October instead of November.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Fruit farmer Heil would settle for another water hookup from the town so he could water all his apple, pear and plum trees, instead of just half of them.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Heil estimates he's lost 10 percent of his crop among his best trees, rooted in good soil and reachable with his 1,100 feet of yellow watering hose, but up to 60 percent of his fruit is gone on the trees in less-productive soil with no irrigation.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Much of his fruit is good only for wine or juice - bringing him 5 1/2 cents a pound, instead of the 51 cents he gets for table pears.</p>
<p class="nitfp">"If we had more water, the fruit would be bigger," he said, standing among dead leaves and shriveled pears littering the ground.</p>
<p class="nitfp">But watering is not an ideal solution - the amount of water he needs would cost $11,200.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Where he can't water, there's only one method left. "Pray," he said.</p>
