<font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size=3>BACKGROUND</font>
<p>
The Knights Templar, the Rosecrucians, and the Druids of ancient
Britain; In Norrath, The Warwinds of Norrath, The Council of Magi, and
the Amber Order: All giants in the dark and fuliginous realm of secret
societies and cadres that have quietly, but firmly, used their
influential hands to turn the wheels of time and civilization, and 
craft the world to their liking. In the vast shadows cast by these 
titans, welcoming the anonymity granted by the flamboyance of it's 
comrades, sits Letalis Ericius: The Deadly Hedgehog. 

<p>

The Society of Hogs of the Hedge was robust and mature long before
these other groups had completed their infancy. Hedgehogs are known to
be symbols of firm resolve, cunning, and virility. Anyone who has
seen a hedgehog calmly stave off an attack by merely rolling itself
into a virtually impenetrable ball, or conceal itself among the plants
that it's pointy hide so closely resembles, or ardently and firmly
express it's affection for it's mate can attest to the true power of
this creature. 

<p>

The widespread spiritual appreciation of the hedgehog on Faydwer led
invading forces to seek its extinction as a means of demoralizing the
populace, making them easier to conquer. But the hog and its followers
were wise and crafty.  In the spring of slaughter that came to be
known as the Great Hog Hunt, the bold invaders laid waste to the vast
hedgehog fields in Steamfront. They planned to attack the Cog, where
Tehe Lol, the oldest known hedgehog, was kept in seclusion. The
assassination attempt was thwarted by a swarthy bunch of young
cavaliers united behind the cause of hedgehog preservation. The defeat
of the invaders was such a rout that the venerable hog's name became a
term of mocking mirth that lives on today as the Letalis Ericius
battle cry. The victorious band of hog guardians remained united, and
thus, in defense of the noble beast, Letalis Ericius was formed.

<p>

Over time, the risk to hedgehogs specifically faded, and the creatures
again frolicked in abundance throughout the realm. But Letalis Ericius
remained, and though the symbol of their order was no longer in
danger, the scars of the past were deep. In hushed conferences and
secret meetings, the noble knights vowed that never again would they
be caught unprepared.

<p>

Age followed age, and though the landscape and people changed, Letalis
Ericius remained strong and subtly controlling. New powers rose and
fell, but the hog was always there. Today, any reputable lexicon
consulted will show the mark of that influence, as the word "hedgehog"
has come to signify several different military defensive constructs -
each deadly to intruders. Letalis Ericius also remains vigilant.

<p>

The shadows have been kind to the Hog, but the time has come for
Letalis Ericius to reveal itself and march openly once again. Evil
forces threaten Norrath and her people, and the general consensus of
the group is that what is most needed is a symbol for the land to
follow. As it has so often done in the past, Letalis Ericius wishes to 
step forward and take up the banner of fighting for all that is good
and just. As the warriors of old, they will dedicate themselves to
diversity (any race or profession may follow the way of the Hog!), so
that all of Norrath may be guarded. It is nobility of action, not of
birth or title, that will inspire invitation into the group. No single
deed, though, will be enough to earn that honor, for even a coward may
prove courageous once by fateful accident. A repeated pattern of brave
accomplishment, selfless sacrifice, and vocal evangelism of the tenets
and beliefs that Letalis Ericius represents will be required for new
membership. 
<p>

<font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size=3>Mission Statement</font>
<p>

Letalis Ericius will dedicate itself to the protection and defense of
Norrath and her various peoples. If anyone requires help, if they so 
much as whisperingly invoke the name of the Hog, one of our brethren 
will do his or her best to aid them. Because we welcome all races and 
classes, we are equipped to provide financial, material, spiritual and
military
aid to those in need. We will not slaughter any citizen of Norrath,
however, over petty disagreements or grudges - and in fact, Letalis
Ericius typically frowns on Discord as a path at all. But for the
glory of Norrath, and for the love of the Hog of the Hedge, Letalis
Ericius will gladly take up arms against any who threaten the land or
her denizens. Our aim is to live up to the principles and goals our
ancestors have passed down to us, carefully preserved by each
generation of Hedgehogs. We also wish to see the hedgehog restored to
its former place of honor. Our noble actions, we hope, may engineer
the introduction of a Hedgehog Sage into the realm....
