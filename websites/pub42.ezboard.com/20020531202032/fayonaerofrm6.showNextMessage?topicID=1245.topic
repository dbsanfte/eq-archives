Did you contact VI? Did you have a email address with your char's name on it through Hotmail or yahoo? Did you have the same password on your email as what was on your account? Its pretty easy to brute or alpha a hotmail or yahoo account. There are not any password restrictions or failed attempt loggers with these services. However in EQ there is a logger, but EQ still follows the crowd on password restrictions there aren't any. For example, it is a lot harder to find the password 3jh4tha459 then it is to find Aardvark (being that its the first &quot;word&quot; in the dictonary). But at least in EQ you are notified about failed attempts when you login. I am still curious about your knowledge of the perpetrator’s in game Name, are you sure he wasn't a old friend who know you a long time ago, and he has since switched CHars.  He may have remembered you back when you were too tired to retrieve your corpse out of black borrow, fortunately he was willing to help you out, and he wrote your password down then. I am just thinking aloud, so don't take any offense from this; I am not making any accusations, just trying to help. <p>random Flamer 001<br>Here Forever!
