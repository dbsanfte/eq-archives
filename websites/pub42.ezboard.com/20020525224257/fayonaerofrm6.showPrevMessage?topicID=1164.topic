So bitch/whine/flame all ya want but when everyone goes home, they're ALL still right =) and oh the epic tails they all will tell.<p>I did find it fairly humorous that a member of LFires opened the original post since they did end up with an epic. *grats btw*<br>Seeing as Flame posts are opened by the whiner/crier.  Odd that one would cry and get an epic.<br>But it Seems the point of remellie's post was more about the training I think.  But who in their right mind would actually train an Epic Camp with a GM in it. *shrug* *No Brain activity before the post I think* Even Boiler *good ol Guk man himself* wouldnt have tried that I dont think =)<p>Then Yuegou Windwalker I must say is a very amusing chap.  Post 53 of the original thread he says:<p>I told Bitty I wouldnt post anymore on this thread with certain exceptions, and if IM keeps posting bullshit on it, I will consider my conversation with her null and void and begin posting anew.<p>When only Sorcha had posted from IM, apparently he hasnt a clue who IM is at all.  And to further this in post 59 he even says "we're painting more of a bs picture" when still no one else from IM had posted "comments" about the issue.  He absolutely has Zero Idea of who anyone in IM is, the man is completely clueless heh I got a good laugh out of that.  Tell ya what if this thread was a trial he wouldnt be too good for the prosecution.<p>Either way its just a f'n game, a game in which we're all gonna be paying 30 percent more for so we can get 30 percent less CService from our GMs who are on 30 percent of the time on 30 percent of the servers.

Nothing different would have happened, [that's] what.  I would have [still] brought up just how easy it is to lose that dragon's aggro.  Even if the guild it &quot;looked&quot; like I was defending was blatantly in the wrong.   Why you ask?  Because I [[didn't]] defend IM.  I only pointed out solid facts as to how [[easy]] it is to lose that dragon.  I defended [[[[[NO ONE]]]]]], other than logic and fact itself.  Someone said it's tough to lose that dragon, I pointed out where they were wrong, they then came back and agreed.
