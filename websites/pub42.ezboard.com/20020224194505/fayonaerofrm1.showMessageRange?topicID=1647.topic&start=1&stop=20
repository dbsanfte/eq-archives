There were about 1500 people total there, inculding staff; 25 showed up on Saturday from A Ro server.  (I got a chuckle that our miniscule guild was the best-represented there, but maybe you more experienced folks have already been to one of these things and wised up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).<br><br>The events on Saturday included a 2 hour 'live quest', two workshop sessions, and a dinner (which was quite good, I am happy to report, if rather rushed).  The live quest involved us getting into teams of 10-14 people, designating a leader (ours was Halagar, we fielded two teams from A Ro), and then the leader would go around and hail various 'NPCs' around the first two levels of the hotel (dressed as High elves, Spirocs, etc), which would then give the party puzzles (of the word search/letter substitution variety, mainly), which we would have to solve in order to get the 'reward', which was paper 'platinum' and 'gold' pieces, which we then had to use to buy two lists of items.  The other A Ro team finished half of the quest (got one list completed), but neither of us ended up in the top 3.  I like puzzles, but I think that they could have come up with something a little more 'interactive' than 13 of us standing around a table scribbling frantically for 1 1/2 hours while Halagar ran from place to place ferrying new/completed puzzles back and forth (only the group leader was allowed to interact with the 'NPCs', else they would despawn).<br><br>After that was two 1 h 15 min workshop sessions, with five different offerings given in each time slot (although some, like the magic and spellcasting one, were in both slots).  Concurrent with the workshops was an 'in game' GM event which was displayed on the screens in the main auditorium for folks to watch if they did not feel like attending a workshop.  Two of my companions went to the trade skills and Magic sessions and said that the trade skills session was fair, but that the magic and spellcasting session was very good and informative.  I went to the 'building better guilds' workshop for first session, which had it not been for a few good suggestions I got from other guild leaders, would have been completely useless.  The facilitator read a bunch of very basic suggestions off of a list, and tended to wander a lot.  I don't know if the fact that he was a Zek-er or the fact that he counts Diablo as an RPG had anything to do with it, but one never knows <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  If the session had been done as a round-table discussion I think it would have been much more productive, as the facilitator himself didn't seem to have much of anything to offer that wasn't basic common sense.<br><br>The Feedback session, (go figure, I went to the feedback session <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) was packed, as you might imagine, and high on the 'vent list' was the changes to the Cleric epic.  The response we got back was a 'let's wait and see how this works out'...  About an hour into the session, I got a chance to voice my concern about the state of the EQ economy, and the fact that EQ is currently so high end oriented that it offers little to new players, and offered the suggestion that the developers work on making the existing areas 'evolve', and resume putting the newspapers out, to help stimulate interest in the game for 'younger' players.  He said that this was a 'good idea', but that was as far as it got.  To the facilitator's credit, he did take some notes, even if he did not answer any question directly <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  To the participants' credit, there was only one uncontrolled rant during the entire hour and 15 minutes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br><br>Immediately after that, it was time for dinner, and during dinner they announced the winners of the Live quest (whose names will be cast as EQ NPCs someplace), and gave away some posters, mousepads, and a castersrealm hat and T-shirt.  The event ended promptly at 9pm (7 1/2 hours after it started), although the announcer admonished us to 'come party with them over at the hotel'.<br><br>The vendor tables were nice, Castersrealm was there selling leather bookcovers, RPGwear was selling their EQ T-shirts, key rings, etc, Safehouse was there selling T-shirts, the artist who did all the EQ artwork (Keith Parkinson) was there selling posters, and there was a weapons salesman, a jewelry/object d'art saleswoman, and an EQ 'Phat Lewt' store which mostly sold race/class pins and mouse pads.  There was also an Intel-sponsored game room where one could hook up live to play EQ during the Faire, although the room was closed after the 'scheduled' events on both Friday and Saturday, so one presumes that one would have had to have visited during the scheduled events or prior to them. <br><br>All in all, it was a pleasant way to spend the day, but certainly not an event worth flying halfway across the country, paying for a hotel, and *then* spending $85.00 per person for.  The facility was very nice, and the event was well-organized, but I think I was most disappointed at the 'hurry up and get this done so we can go party' attitude of the staff.  It would have been nice if there had at least been a keynote speech on *either* day (there was no public address at all on Friday night, and on Saturday the announcer begged off and went straight to the introductions, citing a hangover), something to excite the crowd about being there and about EQ in general, or give the participants some clue as to where EQ is heading from here.<br><br>Heh, maybe I'm just getting old and cranky... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  I did enjoy getting to meet some of the folks from A Ro, especially Narie and Halagar, and if one comes to Atlanta I might show up, but definitely would not go out of my way to attend another Fan Faire.<br><br>Well there you go, you asked for it... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Sincerely,<br>Nydia Ywalmoriel<br>Autonomous Collective<br><br>P.S.
