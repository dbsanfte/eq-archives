<br>
He is after all a Christian. It is likely that he considers the nation to be under God regardless of whether or not it is in the pledge.<br>
<br>
Does being president somehow cancel out his right to express his own religious freedom?<br>
<br>
Expressing his opinion that we are a nation under God is not the same thing as advocating a State religion.<br>
<br>
Saying we are a nation under God while serving as president in no way forces that belief on you.<br>
<br>
I think you go to far here.<br>
You would deny him his own religious freedom when what he did in no way effects you or your beliefs.<br>

He filed a lawsuit against George Bush - because during the campaign, at a debate, Bush was asked who his favorite philosopher was...and he had the nerve to answer "Jesus Christ".<br>

That is it.<br>

<br>
I was watching that debate <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  The difference was, that question (who Bush's favorite philosopher was) was asking him about his *personal* opinion and impinged in no way on public policy, whereas the statement issued yesterday (while it may have been his personal opinion as well) was in direct response to the court ruling (and also, Bush is president now, and it was a public, not a personal, statement).<br>
<br>
I'd also agree that the filer of these lawsuits is an extremist.  If you had my first post in this thread I also stated that I felt that there are several good arguments as to why the Pledge could be defended constitutionally as is, but that 'because of course we're one nation under God, silly', isn't a valid one.  <br>
<br>
Bush is entitled to his own freedom of religion, but that freedom stops when he addresses the nation in an official capacity or speaks for it.<br>

If the president is expressing his personal opinion, that's all well and good.  But if he is speaking in an official capacity, he is representing the Executive branch of government, and therefore should not be either advocating or discouraging any particular religious beliefs.<br>
<br>
I've noticed that Bush throws the word God around a lot in some of his speeches.  But most of the time, when he does so, it is clear that he is speaking for himself out of his own religious faith, and not intending to apply them to others.  However, *in this case* (and my partner, who is Republican and Catholic, was also watching the news broadcast, we both choked in unison), he was making a statement about a specific court decision, and why it should not be upheld, and thus was interjecting religious bias into a policy issue.  *That* is what I took issue with, and if Mr. Bush does not see the conflict of interest here then yes, that is a matter of some concern.<br>

The 10th amendment clearly provides for those rights to be left to the states or the people to decide so I don't see the problem even if they made people recite the lord's prayer or kneel to mecca 5 times a day. It's their municipality, the constitution says it's their right to decide at the state or local level. <br>
<br>
To me this is also part of the problem of the increasing federalisation of education and other parts of the country.<br>

Granted, Mr. Bush does not serve on the Supreme Court, so he cannot influence the ultimate decision in this case directly, but it was still troubling to my friend and I that he would issue such a statement in an official capacity; as such, it was more than a mere 'opinion'.  <br>
<br>
Secondly, I would like to point out that the fact that the Pledge in its current form is *currently* being said in the houses of government has no bearing on whether it is or is not ultimately found to be Constitutional.  To use one of your extremist-style arguments, that would be like (in the 1850s) arguing that slavery was unconstitutional was rediculous because, after all, 'it is practiced every day in ten states...'  <br>
<br>
Finally, putting implementation of a court decision that would require an immediate action on hold pending an appeal is common practice, as has already been stated.  And Mr. Bush did not merely recite the pledge, but used the phrase as justification in itself for why the court decision should be overturned, which is both a religiously based and circular argument.  I do believe we are going to have to agree to disagree on this one, unless you particularly like circles <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
