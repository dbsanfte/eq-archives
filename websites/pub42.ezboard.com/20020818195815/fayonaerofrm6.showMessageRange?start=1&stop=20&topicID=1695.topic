I realize you might not be against this as some people, hard to read too much into one line, but I'm bothered by the criticism this is getting right now.  The African population is heavily devistated by this disease, and the issue hasn't recieved much international attention, at least not the way it needs to.<br><br>In Africa -<br><br>- Some children are born with HIV<br>- Some children have parents with HIV<br>- Some children have siblings with HIV<br>- Those who don't fit the above are likely to know someone with HIV<br><br>It's sad that it comes to this, yes.  But public education and handling of topics like this in a mature fashion is fairly rare these days.  Kids need to be aware of the affects of HIV, of the lifestyle changes that go along with them.  I seriously doubt the show is going to be focused on sex, that wouldn't make much sense.  You can get HIV from more ways than sex.<br><br>I'm not even sure you can fault the parents, when you consider social/eduational situations in Africa.  Watching what I say here because it's a HUGE place and no one generalization will work - but look at some of the areas, we're not exactly talking well educated.  <br><br>I don't know how it is where you live, but my city is fairly conservative, and therefor pretty upset about this.  Community voices claim this is inappropriate for children.  But then, you have to see their wisdom.
