HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Loot rules discussion</span><hr size=1> Basically I agree with everything Rikko said, but here's my take anyway.<br>
<br>
Breastplates and greaves done in this manner would be great *if* they were something that generally dropped as often as everything else in every zone.  I understand the 55+ rule being that players that are the highest levels *should* be getting hit more often and need the higher ac/stats and for the most part, breastplates and greaves are the most rare drops.  However... seeing a bp or greaves go to a level 55+ that is rarely on raids but happens to show up to a raid once in awhile and gets the chance to roll on the best drops... I can see how that would bother people.  <br>
<br>
Keeping things as simple and as fair as possible is the best way in my opinion, while at the same time doing what is best for the guilds as a whole.  A breastplate or greaves on a level 50-54 tank isn't going to benefit the raid as much as a breastplate or greaves on a level 55+ tank.  We all want great gear... we all want better survivablity, but I would rather see a leather tunic drop in Kael (using that as an example since Kael was mentioned) go to a 55+ monk/druid/etc rather than me because it will benefit the guilds on a whole more to have those that gain more aggro more often than I do, do more damage, etc... to have better gear than I do.  I'll get my turn when I hit 55+ or when everyone there 55+ has a bp or greaves.<br>
<br>
I do agree that a point system is a good idea even though I'll never be that high on the list.  Raids usually start before my daughter goes to bed and are half over or almost over by the time I log on.  Kenzo cannot make very many raids do to his work schedule, so he will never be very high on the list either.  We'll miss out, but that's as it should be since we cannot be there as much as we would like to and when we aren't there... we are not participating... we're not helping DS and OOBS.<br>
<br>
Just my 2cp. <p><a href="http://www.project-ayanami.com/shafe/"><img src="http://home.swbell.net/kryson/shansig6.jpg" border=0><br>

Loot order or list will go down as probably the most difficult thing about EQ.. second only to a druid getting a group in seb!..<br>
We have had some success with loot order and points in the past and is our best hope.. <br>
But the thing I have noticed lately is the amount of drops we have been getting lately.. Lilas, My main, never got any fear armor or seen any drop after many trips there till he was lvl 55. But we have seen a number of drops in the last few raids. I think if we just had these raids little more often, we all would have something. Silk is dropping like theres no end.. <br>
<br>
The worse thing is,someone getting mad about not getting a drop and leaving just to have it drop again a few drops later. Seen this happen to a enchanter in hate.. but her leaving only showed her reason for coming to the raid. <br>
<br>
Again the loot list is written in pencil not stone.. adjustments need to be made, but while a drop rots on a mob isn't the time to do it.<br>

How many ppl in Kael did I crack last night? since I was the only chanter there for a while till a couple other of us fine chaps made it =P Sheesh I bet I was tossing 15-30 cracks a round.Add haste to that and I stayed oom.Pants would've came in handy on the next raid lol.But I lost fair n square......lost on sleeves and that bracer too *cries*.But eventually my time will come.By the time 55 rolls around,I prolly have better than the quest robe anyhoo &lt;I hope&gt;. But the thing we need to keep track of is who got what on the pevious trip.*Studly#1 won roll on earring of Asswhoopedness* so Studly#1 is SOL on the next run if the mate for his earring drops untill all that need one have it. Regardless of how many points he/she has or how many raids they been to.<br>
          I still agree with a NBG basis for a loot table tho. If ya got better stuff on then tuffy beans.Don't matter if ya lvl 6 or 60. Let someone that can get some use out of it roll. Not someone that has better and rolls on it just to hit EC after the raid with an auction hotkey in place.=P<br>
Granted the quest armours are no drop but you know what I mean lol<br>

The bit about EC, if you are ever found selling an item you got on an alliance raid, you will NEVER get another piece of loot on a raid again.  We dont raid to get loot so you can pad your coffers, we raid for the betterment of the alliance.  As for the points, the purpose of it is to reward those who are most dedicated, not as a means for person x who has better gear than person y, to get even better gear.  Thats all for now.  Cheers!<br>

    All these posts happened in no time.  But I'm glad that this issue came up, especially since we have both guilds filling input on it.  <br>
<br>
   Ok, until we get the point system hammered out, I believe that we should continue just the 55+ and highest in each class getting a chance on bp's/robes.  I'm not saying that lower levels shouldn't have a chance, and I totally agree where you are coming from.  The other week I won silk headband or something...which I will be giving to Eilen since I have better already.  This is what I believe should happen.  You win a roll and have better, pass down to others what you can.  Everyone's dream is to have better armor, I can tell you this from personal experience.  But listen to this, we seem to be raiding kael a lot.  How many raids do you think it will take until everyone already has certain pieces and they are being passed down to others.  Not many more, especially since we have been getting very lucky with drops.  I have been at a kael raid for 4 hours and seen one thing drop.  So it all depends.  Someone posted that Dine and Paith die alot.  I think Paith beats me at deaths, and I usually try hard to die =P.  The ac on a kael bp I believe offers more ac than the one Paith is currently wearing, which may just save his life one day.  Which would increase our pulling, which would increase our pulls, which would increase our kills and drops.  Well guys, I know there is something else I really want to say, but can't think of it atm. =P  So I'll post it later.<br>
