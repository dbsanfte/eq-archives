<br>
Edeina, EVERYONE automatically gives respect to those people who look and act respectable within thier set of standards.  Only a very small group of people, world-wide, consider it a perfectly respectable decision to run around in a patent leather dominatrix outfit.  Outside of the small circle that considers that normal, the reaction will range from an extra long look to extreme disgust and anger.  The person putting on that outfit knows this and, at least subconsciously, is anticipating the reaction.  If you anticipate the reaction then it makes sense that you are accepting it as soon as you step out the door.<br>
<br>
The assumption that overtly sexual women are sluts while similar men aren't isn't fair, but it's the way things are.  I don't agree with the perception but it's a personal reaction.  Again, we are all aware of the reactions we can expect, so we can safely anticipate them.  When you put on the outfit you knew what the reactions might be.<br>

<br>
I don't think women's intuition extends to total omniscience.<br>
<br>
In terms of the situation that brought this up, in game, it just doesn't fly.  Any random female char in game has no control over the contours of her body, the way her armor fits that body, or what every person in game sees, except themselves.  This line of thought above essentially means that no high elf females should wear any form of leather armor under any circumstances because some twit with no self-control will then have the justifiable right to call them a whore.  It also means no female char should ever die, because god forbid that same twit might be near their bind point and see them naked.  That's not even considering people who can't use the new models and don't know what they look like to begin with.<br>
<br>
As for the rl side of it, I wonder if all these people claiming it's the woman's fault would feel the same way, if it were their mother standing on the sidewalk in clothing totally respectable by western standards, and a man from a less permissive culture (see burquas, etc) walks up to her, spits on her, and calls her a whore.  If he thinks being able to see a woman's face and  hair is slutty it's ok then, right?  By the way of thinking expressed here, he probably should throw a few rocks too, because obviously your mother knew better and didn't care. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uedeina.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Edeina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Board Mistress</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/17/01 8:32:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=717.topic&index=63>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.one.se/users/chribesk/edeina.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sexy does NOT equal &quot;for sale&quot;, ok?!!!</span><hr size=1> /laugh Crydee<br>
Hehe, that's a good one. I agree that the pre-luclin robes look totally like dresses, regardless of what gender wears them. My male cleric never wore robes before luclin for that reason, but it's a easy choise for him since breastplates have better stats anyway. Lets go and mock all male casters for being transvestites, shall we...?

You do have control over how your character appears, at least some control.  If you don't want your breasts hanging out for the 12 year olds to oggle, wear an outfit that doesn't display them so prominently.  My DE rogue refused to wear non-velious chain before SOL came out.  Not worth the irritation as far as I was concerned.  When I wore regular chain I always got tells from morons telling me I had 'nice tits.'  A simple reply of &quot;I'm male, you're pathetic, and they are pointy for god's sake you damn freak,' got old...so I started wearing rygorr <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Problem solved.<br>

Nope, he didn't get banned for that post, just like Ghallunt didn't get banned for saying that he just like to annoy people. It's about the total view. I should have banned him a long time ago. Like when he harassed Kivorn (a person he had allready been suspended by Verant for harassing) in the thread about Kivorn's resignation. Instead I just deleted his message. Or better yet, I should have caught him by IP-banning the mule account he used to make RL threats against me on the board. He made similar threats ingame, I could have gotten him a permanent banning if I had bothered. <br>
<br>
As for the picture, it's from a text titled spelandets mörka sida, which translates to The Dark Side Of The Gaming. It's partly a satire over conservatives who believe that computer games and roleplaying games turn people into maniacs, and on the picture I had goofed up as much as I could to look as evil AND nerdy as possible. Corel's choise of picture, combined with his choise of words, in this context, is something entirely different from &quot;posting someones RL picture&quot;. But I wouldn't have banned him if it wasn't for his track record of serious harassment. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

<br>
&quot;The way things are&quot; is not something static. It changes over time. If we fight the sexism and bigotery we can win ground against it. If we let it win on walk over it gains ground and will limit peoples freedom even further. This kind of fights is not just a matter for politicians and philosophers, it's a ongoing process in our everyday life.<br>

LOL yes!<br>
The good old pre-velious DE female chain. And human female chain and erudite female leather top. Never liked to see those worn in combat, they felt, well, unprotective somehow <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
Looked more like underwear then like armor. Kinda cute and all, but pure eyecandy. Of course people look a bit more if you wear such, and if you don't want them to look then it's wise of you not to wear it. People staring at it was why Verant put it there in the first place. Still, if someone is too immature to handle that, then he do not belong in the game. Like that guy in Nydias example about a monk. Your example doesn't come anywhere close, and does not constitute harassment at all IMHO.<br>
<br>
Now that's another thing I'm pissed about.<br>
People dilluting words meaning beyond reason. A man looking at a woman is not harassment, and petty theft is not rape -economical or otherwise. Yes, I actually encountered the later in a tabloid once. Some moron whineing about how his walled had been raped. I'm not claiming that anyone here have used a unreasonable wide definition of harassment, but as common as that bullshit is, someone might have thought I was doing that if nothing else. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Love, Edeina<br>

yup seems like it... allthough i dont think he succeded in anything by posting it i still think it was lame and extremely childish.<br>
there are pictures of all of us in not so good poses.. heck i have a ton of pics on myself on a LARP dressed up as a orc and the mask refused to stay on my face due to the temperature at the time (-20c) so i superglued it to my face and well.. imagine how easy it is to remove a latex mask from your face when its attached with superglue.<br>
<br>
i read somewhere that "if you walk around dressed like a dominatrix you should expect people to react" well sorta true but this is a game... and i think people should react even more on kittens in plate armor or blue faced darkelfes running around with knifes screaming campcheck every 5 min..<br>
the highelf look on SoL is suggestive but it does not in any way validate someone to call you a whore..<br>
this is considered sexual harassment and is NR 1 on VI policy list on offences.. this is a permanent ban without warning.<br>
some may think its unfair but i dont.. if you think before you speak and have over 15 IQ you will never get any problems.<br>
<br>
if you tell someone you meet RL that they look like a whore you will get smashed to a pulp for it..<br>
and if not you should be atleast.<br>
<br>
and to those of you that think girls with big chests and short skirts have themselfs to blame for beeing raped... well crawl back under your bible and stay there..<br>
this is the same people that teaches their children right from wrong with violence. <br>
hitting someone causes fear not respect..<br>

Maybe women more sexually secure than men? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uedeina.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Edeina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Board Mistress</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/18/01 2:14:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=717.topic&index=73>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.one.se/users/chribesk/edeina.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sexy does NOT equal &quot;for sale&quot;, ok?!!!</span><hr size=1> Itera:<br>

Ya, in many cases. At least that's my experience. The more conservative and repressive morals, the more violence, disrespect and outright hatred towards the people you should care about. This becomes very ironic when it comes to S/M. The same people who whine the most about the horrors of consensual sadomasochism, the same people gladly beat their own children and sometimes wives. I guess beating people are ok after all, just make sure they really suffer from it and take physical and emotional damage for real. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

I think it has to do with the fact that, by and large... women aren't penalized in the larger culture for 'acting masculine', but men always have to be on guard about not being perceived as feminine (and a shame it is too, because they have tight restrictions on huge chunks of human experience and feeling, methinks).  In EQ, no-one has to know what you are in real life, so why not access your anima a bit? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Not to mention that your female avatars look so attractive and powerful and cool...<br>
<br>
When I was a small child, I had imaginary friends, etc etc... but also liked to roleplay a lot, even then.  Even at the age of six I was very aware that there were status differences, etc, between males and females and I did in fact put on a male persona from time to time.   I had been given a blue pair of PJs that I thought looked very 'boy' (blue is a boys color, right?) so I would put them on when 'Mark' was coming to visit for a while. I was very aware of how I *felt* differently assuming what I thought was a male persona as well.<br>
<br>
I don't play male characters often any more (I do have a male erudite mage and half-elf ranger, both low level, in EQ), but did for a long time play a male druid and aristocrat in D &amp; D and Traveller, respectively, and both were well fleshed out personalities.  It can be very enlightening, as well, to see how you can do/say the exact things in the different 'skins', with very different perceptions/results depending on what gender the recipients *think* you are... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

So I get him a few levels and then I get into trouble and some guys runs there to help me, heals me up and things like that..

Players of human chars are not more sure of their humanity then players of other races, players of paladins are not more sure about being good people then players of shadowknights. The ones who have a problem with identity are those who jump at the thought of a person playing a character of a certain race/class/gender/religion/whatever. And of course, those who REALLY have a problem are the ones who confuse ingame characters with the RL people who play them. Good thing that is rare. <br>
<br>
People should just play what they feel like. When someone want to play only characters of a certain race or gender or whatever, or exclude a certain option, hey, as long as you are having fun! Me, I like variation. I have characters of all races and classes and of both genders. Not in all possible combinations of those three traits of course. My main characters are a female highelf magician and a male human cleric. Liked having a pet and all, and she ended up as my primary char. <br>
<br>
As for the poll, it's interesting. But such polls are not all that reliable. I would reccomend the following report for whoever might be interested in the subject. According to that scientific research, 47,9% of all male players and 23,3% of all female players have at least one character of the other gender then their RL, and 15,7% of the males and 2,5% of the females have such a char as main char.<br>

It's not much different from walking along the side of the road at night wearing dark clothing. No, it's not your fault if you get hit by a car, and yes, the person who hit you is still legally responsible... but there was probably something you could have done to prevent that. That person will still be to blame, and that person will still be responsible, however, you'll be just as dead. <p><IMG SRC=http://www.tiannathomas.com/images/roliel3.gif>

I read alot on these boards but rarely post. But this tread is absurd.<br>
<br>
Rent a movie &quot;The Accused&quot; starring Jodie Foster.<br>
After watching that come back and explain to me again how what a woman wears or has a &quot;reputation&quot; for is justification for harrassment.<br>
<br>
Numarye Whiteraven<br>
<br>
P.S. Speaking as a women, it can be very easy to get a &quot;bad&quot; reputation without deserving it. ex: Person A hates Person B. Person A spreads rumors and outright lies about Person B. Persons D,K,Q and Z believe Person A and pass lies on. <br>
<br>
Result = Person B (who is totally innocent) now has a &quot;bad&quot; reputation.<br>
<br>
So following this logic...Person B has this reputation and is dressed in *THAT* way. She must therefore be a slut.<br>
