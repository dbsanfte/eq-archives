With 103 degree fever, I sat at my computer and by the side of Fionna, our lvl 60 cleric for 26 hours.  It started as a way to support my guild mate who at level 60 would be our first cleric with the rez stick and it ended in defending her from basic in-game terrorists.<br>
<br>
At the side of Matahari who took down Naggy, Fionna encouraged, buffed, healed and rezzed.  At the side of Matahari, Fionna fought and killed Ragefire... not on the condition she could take their camp over when they were done... she did it just because she wanted a fellow cleric to have their epic.  At the side of Matahari, Fionna made a decision to continue the camp, surrounded by friends, guild mates, allies and strangers that wanted to help her get her epic as well.<br>
<br>
Some people view it as obssessive.. it's just a game... it doesn't really figure into anyone's real life.  Ask the young girl's family from Karana server who lost her battle with cancer.  Completely isolated from human contact during her battle with leukemia, EQ was her source of communication and inspiration.  If for one moment, you attach the name Fionna to that girl, you have a hell of a different story line for this event. The impact of what Landslide did not only remains to be the singular most abhorent behavior I have personally witnessed in this game by a player to a player, the fact that it was a guild mounted terrorist act by those too weak to deal with accepted modes of operation BEGS for appropriate action by server GMs, guilds that are a decent and players that won't allow this lack of respect to exist.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying to take pity on people.... but as much as it is a game, as much as it 'really doesn't matter in real life' if Fionna or any other cleric gets their epic, there are HUMANS behind every PC roaming character in Norrath.<br>
<br>
As an officer of Immortal Mercy, I talked with Fenriz (guild leader of Landslide) for at least an hour when they first arrived to invade our camp.  At the time, there were over 20 people in the Lair that were there to help Fionna attain her last piece for her epic only three of which were in IM.  Fenriz named guild name after guild name of those that were in the zone and to each one I responded, &quot;They are here helping us too.&quot;  Matahari, Vision, Stone Dogs, Sphere of Transcendence, Allied Giants, Dragons of Mist, Tides of Valor, Seven Eyes and others were all present on behalf of Fionna's diligent camp.  <br>
<br>
What followed was shocking.  Landslide pet casters, planted their pets on the RF spawn point while Landslide guild members piled onto the same spot in an effort to prevent Fionna from turning in her Shimmering Pearl.  It was no longer about their cleric getting the Ragefire spawn first... it became an effort to prohibit Fionna from even approaching Ragefire when he spawned.<br>
<br>
You can read the rest of the details in Sorcha's post on the first page of this thread.<br>
<br>
Landslide self admittedly can not take down Naggy.  They have now made a reputation for themselves on countless occasions of KSing various high level camps; of training guilds in an effort to take over a camp (Venril Sathir); KSing mobs by training creatures to kill groups mid-way through a fight so they could finish off the mob, loot it and flee before the original group made it back to the zone (Lodizal) all because they were not going to waste their time on a camp when another guild will &quot;camp it for them&quot; and Lanslide can come in at spawn time and KS the mob.<br>
<br>
Landslide is the Landfill of Norrath.  I'm anxious for the day that enough guilds and people petition Landslide's behavior that Verant has no alternative but to ban each Landslide player from eq.  In this instance, you deserve to be judged by the company you keep.<br>

<br>
We've had a lot of people help us camp Ragefire.  Until recently we didn't have the &quot;low mains + alt&quot; support to do Nagafen.  Our mains were too high, our alts were too low.  Like other guilds on the server, we had to depend on our relationship with the other guilds.<br>
<br>
There are a handful of players, and, it seems, a handful of guilds who continue to demonstrate that they have no interest in working as a community.  Again and again the rules of the game are confused with the rules of polite society.  The <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>excuse</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> given for doing things to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  people</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>
There are people behind the characters in this &quot;game.&quot;  They laugh, they cry, they enjoy each other's company.  They get happy, they get angry, and sometimes they get frustrated enough to throw punches at each other.<br>
<br>
I'm not interested in using the game as a tool to take joy away from other people.  It's disgusting that other people are.<br>

We can have 2 rage/week and it s really easy to rotation on him<br>

Guild rdy for rotation is  one guild with 2 clerics rdy with perle.<br>
After Rage pop, and if the guild not online and enouth firepower for handle him, Rage spot turn FFA and after the kill, the next guild are up.<br>
<br>
2 per week = 10 rage/month and Uber guild will not need loots rage lots before be done with their clerics. Unfilled spot in month can be alloyed at small guild who want try Rage.<br>

this my position for rage and all Similar mobs.<br>

<br>
I guess it all comes down to courtesy.  If a guild dedicates 65+ hours of their time holding the ragefire camp, they should be given the opportunity (within reason) to attempt ragefire.  By opportunity i mean that they should already have enough folks in the lair or close to it to gather enough folks to kill ragefire faster than most other guilds can gather.  To barge in on their camp and park pets on the spawn spot is very poor behaviour IMO.<br>
<br>
However, all this being said, the cleric that turns in his pearl, gets the heart. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/umissxeni.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MissXeni</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/9/01 6:55:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=512.topic&index=68>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I am sad..</span><hr size=1> rofl.

<br>
The difference is: you don't choose the colour of your skin, but you do choose who you associate with.  Because you made that choice, the actions of your associates rub off on you.  Not 100% - people who were not there are obviously not directly responsible.  But... you could deguild.  Or you could try to convince your guild to make amends and hence clear the air... help Fionna camp Rage as someone suggested.<br>
<br>
If you don't take action, you are tacitly approving of the actions of your associates.<br>
<br>
You may feel free to ignore me here, but it is the way the real world works - best learn this lesson here in a game than learn it the hard way in RL where it counts :-)<br>
