Lets give that debate a thread of it's own.<br>
<br>
Me, I am principially very much against death penalty.<br>
<br>
My main argument is that death is final and humans do make mistakes. Kill the wrong guy, and you can't get it undone. I think that killing is wrong, and can only be acceptable when it's utterly neccesary, like in selfdefense.<br>
<br>
The arguments for death penaly seem to be:<br>
<br>
*saving money<br>
*revenge<br>
*protection<br>
<br>
The first argument is bullshit. That it's cheaper to kill someone then to lock him up is not a valid reason to slaughter a human being!<br>
<br>
Revenge, I don't agree with that concept. Sure, I too can feel that way sometimes. Hate, selfrighteousness, jeaolusy and more are feelings that live in us all, but that does not make them right. We shoud aspire to be good, not to wallow in our lowest emotions.<br>
<br>
Protection, now that's the only argument I can feel some sympathy for. If someone have terrorized you, then he might get out one day and resume his activities if he's in jail, but if he is dead then it's over. <br>
<br>
On the whole, I think the reasons against Death Penalty far outweigh the reasons for it.<br>
<br>
By the way, things are usually more complicated then finding the right person to punish. I would reccomend the movie &quot;Dancer in the dark&quot;, where Bjork's character murder a policeman who is also one of her best friends. If one of them have to be pointed out as a villian then it's him, but he's actually not a bad person either. Hard to explain. See it. Might give you nightmares, but see it anyway. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

1. It's been proven by study after study that going to jail does not reform people. <br>
-- If anything it makes them better criminals.<br>
<br>
2. Consequence for your actions. <br>
-- Kill someone and be killed, or Kill someone and go to jail for a few years, get out on probation, etc etc. which sounds more detering?<br>
<br>
3. Is a mass murderer a human being?<br>
-- while we're at the philosophy of killing a human being to save a buck. Is someone that goes around killing innocent people for no particular reason a human being?  IMHO no, they're monsters.<br>
<br>
Is the system perfect? Newp.<br>
Is letting them sit in jail and kill each other just as good? Newp.<br>
<br>
Does it make sense putting Police and Prison guards lives in danger by making them baby sit these hardened criminals and murderers? Newp.<br>

We are playing God. Whether or not one believes in a higher being, that is what we are doing. Does one person who is elected to the position of judge (or however it is done) really have the almighty power to say that a person deserves to die? Besides, kind of going on what Bashur said, I think that a person who murdered someone 'just to do it' should be stuck in a cell watching home movies of the person they killed, day in and day out, and get to know everything there is to know about that person...just so they know what they took away from the rest of the world. That is one of the things I have found about murderers, it is easier for them to kill if they know nothing about the person. They are just feeding the hunger to kill. They pick a random person, and do it. They are just a random victim. So, make them suffer! <br>
<br>
For self defense: I see it like animals. When an animal is attacked by another animal, he defends himself. That is forgivable. <br>

<br>
The death penalty in some states, is there for a reason.<br>
<br>
While I agree with Bashur, that life imprisonment is far worse for the one penalized this way, keeping people on death row is a waste of space in our prison sysytem.<br>
<br>
Also, people on death row ARE still eligable for parole.<br>
<br>
Charles Manson, who has been sentenced to life in prison, and is on death row, still gets parole hearings every few years.<br>
**note** The only reason Manson is even still alive, is because California had done away with the death penalty, just mere months before he was sentenced**<br>
<br>
I live in a state that gives you an option...hang, or lethal injection. I was raised in a state that still uses the electric chair. I was around when Ted Bundy was fried in that chair.<br>
<br>
I have a friend, whose dad was hung, in my state, for the crimes he committed. She is a supporter of the death penalty.<br>
<br>
If someone has the balls and the utter disrespect of life, to take the life of another? Then they deserve to have their life taken from them. &quot;An eye for an eye&quot;<br>

When a census is taken, those inmates count as inhabitants of those rural areas, therefore inflating the population. When money is passed around, those rural areas recieve more money based on their inmate population. This means money is being taken away from the urban areas, who could use it to institute programs to lower crime and increase education. Also, since correctional facilities are usually funded with federal money, and never funded with county money, the money going to that area doesn't help the inmates either.<br>

Doesn't really have anything to do with the death penalty, but it's something else that bugs me about our penal system. <p><html><b><green>Roliel Glorysong</b></green>

<br>
Personally, I see life in prison without parole as cruel and unusual punishment.  A quick, clean death would be much preferable to a slow tortured death inside a cage.  <br>
<br>
I think the cost of keeping a man fed, clothed, housed and guarded is a real factor considering that person will never again make any kind of contribution to society.  <br>
<br>
If someone comes up with a way to completely rehabilitate a murderer and make him into a person who can contribute meaningfully to society AND guarantee that person will never again commit ANY crime, then and only then would I see getting rid of the death penalty as an option.<br>
<br>
I have heard it argued that the death penalty violates a persons right to &quot;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&quot;.  I disagree.  When you rob a person of their inalienable right to life, you forfeit your own.<br>

<br>
For me, the issue boils down to one thing:  Punishment.  Not revenge or cost savings.  Protection is a by-product of the death penalty.  Certainly it isn't a deterent for many within the US simply because of it's inconsistent use.  People should be held accountable for their actions.  Contrition is good and very much needed, but that does not remove the consequences of ones actions.<br>
<br>
I am for the death penalty as a punishment to certain crimes.  I don't see it as a barbaric practice or take satisfaction with its use.  I do see it as an unfortunate step society should take to see the consequences are properly meeted out. <p><B><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2 COLOR="#3A6EA5">Jzonn Stormwolf &ltFinal Destiny&gt</B></FONT></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ulleauaric.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lleauaric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/26/01 5:39:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=627.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.att.net/~ashleyellinor/images/photoindex/deniroguns.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lets kill everyone who kills!</span><hr size=1> The death penalty is about justice, and it is not easily handed out<br>

Or say that a member of a child pornography league gets caught, and it is proven that he has been the leader of the league and has raped several children (say maybe even yours) do you still consider him to be a human that deserves to live??<br>

Personally i am all for death penalty, but i live in sweden and it's never going to go into use here... around here the longest sentence you can get is like 15 years or something.... /sigh... <p><form><select><option NAME="Jeopardy">Jeopardy  -  41 Rogue<option

Learn it, it's the key to understanding the American Judicial system.<br>
<br>
All DNA evidence is suspect.  If you don't believe that, read about the OJ Simpson cluster fuc...I mean trial.<br>
<br>
The fact that 85 people were released, does not mean the DNA evidence proved them innocent, it just means it introduced some microscopic piece of reasonable doubt.  That's all it takes to be set free in the US, a small tidbit of reasonable doubt.<br>
<br>
Since, you like statistics: In those 85 cases, how many times was a new person convicted based on the new DNA evidence?<br>
<br>
If you want to debate the major flaw in the US criminal or law enforcement system, you need to be looking at how we've fought our war on drugs.  That's where the real cause of prison overcrowding lies.<br>
<br>
I wonder what percentage of the people in US prisons are there for murder.  I bet it's less than 5%.  Of those 5%, how many are on death row?  I'll bet it's less than 1%.<br>
<br>
Any of you reference librarians wanna take a shot at it?  I'll try and dig around some later to find out.<br>

<br>
The death penalty is wrong. Murdering people is wrong. Letting people out of jail before they have served enough time is wrong. Letting people get off on technicalities is wrong. <br>
<br>
The solution to the death penalty is simple. Mandatory life in prison with no chance of parole in a prison that uses chain gangs, has no cable tv, no weight rooms, no fun. <br>
<br>
Punishment in America has been labeled cruel and unusual. The only thing you're allowed to do is lock somone up..but in the mean time, let them have conjugal visits, earn a college degree, lift weights, shoot pool, and watch TV....prison should be punishment. <br>
<br>
As long as people don't feel that prison adequately punishes people, people will want the death penalty.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uakreon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Akreon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/26/01 6:19:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=627.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Death Penalty</span><hr size=1> I think Death is too easy.

The two most noticable cases of penal colonies gone awry? Australia and the United States <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Ok, the US wasnt exactly a penal colony, but England did ship off a bunch of their &quot;undesireables&quot; to be used as a work force as indentured servents, and the result ended up being the same.  The &quot;prisoners&quot; took over the prison and began governing themselves.<br>

The Death Penalty is handled on a State by State basis.<br>
Even then it varies wildly<br>
<br>
In my state, Connecticut, for example.  We have the death penalty..  the last time it was used however was in 1965 against Mad Dog McChultsky.  There are currently 25 people on the Death Row at the moment.  These include a Cop Killer who set up a ambush against a State Trooper and killed him with a point blank shot to the back of the head, A gang member that was sexually abusing his Girlfirends children and used her 8 month old Infant like a baseball against a brickwall to try to terrorize her into silence.  2 brothers that that killed at 8 year old boy and his mother becuase the boy was going to testify against him in a upcoming trial.  The list goes on and on.<br>
<br>
But the power to change this policy lies in the hands of the voters from every state.  Similar to the federal government the states are set up similar, with a House and Senate comprised of people locally elected to serve the area they are from.  It is a MUCH cozier relationship however, as the people on the state level are people who live and work in the community and are easily accessable and availible and everyone knows them.  <br>
<br>
So nothing is being forced on anyone, we live and work under conditions we can have a direct say in.   Not all states have the death Penalty, Not all states that have it, use it.  the ones that do its by the direct will of the people living in that area <p>Lleauaric Fyrewynd<br>Sorcerer<br>Knight of Eternal Wrath<br>Ayonae Ro<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3749">Gear</a>

<br>
never ever left my home, except for once a month to buy instant noodles. thats all i ever ate. id never leave my home, i was completely alone with no contact for about 3 months. this was by choice i guess. these people in prison get better food than i eat even now. they have no responsibilities. it sounds like a damn good life to me. the only thing id be annoyed with would be having other people with me.<br>
<br>
i suffer from severe anxiety and depression.. maybe my view is a bit skewed.. but prison aint bad at all.<br>
<br>
as for death penalty.. its too easy. get rid of the fucking idiots. an eye for an eye. cut off a thiefs hand, mangle a rapists penis so he cant get an erection anymore, or better yet, make it so he cant ejaculate. that would be nice. make punishments that are worse than the crimes. make people stop being stupid and mean and nasty.<br>
<br>
i have no faith in humanity whatsoever, i fully expect to be used and abused for the rest of my life. why not let everyone go free? you know, it was circumstance that made them do bad things. they arent evil. who needs punishment? lets let everyone do what they want to do, everyones a fucking asshole anyway. i hate most people you see.<br>
<br>
if you are bad, you deserve to die. thanks. <p><center><Br><img src="http://www.iinet.net.au/~arc/porndie.jpg"></center>
