Dont ask me to explain, I can't fully comprehend it myself.<br>
<br>
As far as the yo yo theory, they *think* they've proven that isnt possible, due to the shape of the universe.  This is all about planes and such, which I dont understand at all, so I cant really argue for it or against it.<br>
<br>
And as far as God creating the universe, something Ive never personally understood is why the Big Bang theory and God must be so Black and White, one or the other.  Im just curious, why can't God have a method of creation, and why can't that method be evolution?<br>
<br>
Time is not linear, when it is said that God created Man, it just might be that for God, time is no object and he can reach &quot;forward&quot; and &quot;backward&quot; at will in his creative efforts...perhaps its all one with him....<br>
<br>
It seems to me, the two are not mutually exclusive.  The concept of an entire Universe being created out of nothing, with no center and no end, expanding into more nothing at unimaginable speeds...sounds fairly divine to me.<br>

As some of you say God created this then can you also explain to me why in the early temples (christian temples) they used Egytptian Gods that ressurected jesus (images on walls still preserved) can you then also explain to me howcome they found a statue of the same face in 4 different continents before there was even someone that could write the word Jesus.<br>
<br>
Then 1 more thing can you explain to me how God created man by putting Adam and Eve on this planet and no one else? you can't tell me that Adan and Eve had 1000 babies (oh and did adam and eve have a daughter?)<br>
<br>
and 1 last mind boggle for ya .<br>
If God created man then who created god?<br>

<br>
1st) Jesus was not ressurected by Egyptian Gods (and no, not by a rez stick either.) as many of you know, there is God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, God the Son (Jesus) was sent down to earth to save us.. blah blah, you guys know this, and he was killed to save us from our sins. He was then Ressurected by God the Father (God) and was alive once more.  And this is the confusing part, you might wonder, well I thought they were all the same person? and, in truth they are. But that's for you to ponder.<br>
<br>
2nd) I never heard of any statues, and i don't know what your talking about.  Many different things come from differrent Religions. (I myself am Baptist.) so i don't knwo much about other religions.<br>
<br>
3rd) Adam and Eve were the first man and woman on Earth.  They had babies togather (and no, not tons of them) maybe two or three, it is unclear how many exactly they had.  But their babies reproduced, and their babies reproduced, and so forth.  That started a long process where human's were multiplying.  And that pretty much covers that question.<br>
<br>
4th) Yes God created man. To answer your question.. No one created God, God is has been here from the very beginning, when there was no universe, no starts, no planets.  God created that all, you probably heard about the 6 days of Creation and on the 7th day he rested. But it is unclear how long a day was back then.  A day could have been hundreds of years, even millenia.  And no, God is not a big giant floating in outer space, he reigns in Heaven (don't ask me where this is, no one knows, except if you have died and gone there.) And that pretty much does it.<br>
<br>
<br>
PS: No, i am not a preacher, I am a 16 year old kid who goes to Church every sunday at 9 AM and listens to what is being said.  That is how I know so much.  And many of you are different religions and believe different things than I do, and that's not bad, the most important thing is that you believe and you WILL go to Heaven when you die.<br>

The problem is there are so many questions and some cant be answered.  I am a christian, however i find myself questioning some things about the bible, but thats only natural.  As men we are very intuative, and always wanting to see things to believe them and having little faith.  This life is to short and meaningless for this just to be it, so there must be some afterlife and a creater or God.  <br>
<br>
I believe their is a god because we had to have come from somewhere, and to look around at this earth and see how it was just cater made for us, quite perfect for us to live on, and there are no other places we can live on.  <br>
<br>
Bliond, religion is a man made thing, all you need as a code for liveing is the bible (mainly the 10 commandments) and to accept Jesus as your savior.  Have you read it?  All it teaches is to be good and lead a good life, which we all know is how we are suppose to live.  Of course its fun to do all the things we are not suppose to, we all do them even I, quite often, but I always ask for forgivness.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Well I could ramble on for hours but I have studying to do, so please reply, this is a topic that needs to be talked about, we go along to much in life obessesed with this petty life, not talking or discussing about where we came from and are going.<br>
