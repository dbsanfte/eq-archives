That must have been dragon slaying at its finest. We gathered, we grouped, we killed, and we left all under 2 hours...quite impressive! While the lady was more than generous in her loot to my guild (white scale for Syrena, lottoed white scale for myself, lottoed hammer for Wedri) sadly only 2 of the 30 something of you outside of my guild won anything, so here is your second chance!<br>
<br>
*Must be in Permafrost by 8:00 PM EST (5:00 PM PST). I am going to make the groups at that point exactly, not even arrivals at 8:01 will be taken. We will have the firepower in zone I am sure so no need to screw around waiting for people.<br>
*Melee must have a shield with them. The key to killing Vox is keeping her manaless and bashed up against the corner.<br>
*Resist GEAR! This can't be stressed enough and a lot of people overlook this. I am going to ask that everyone have at least 100 points of cold and magic resists UNBUFFED. This is especially critical for bards, enchanters, and clerics as these classes getting feared can screw their whole group or the raid. Bark Potions are not required but can be helpful turning a fear into a stun (they cast root on you, get some in case). Easy resist gear is Cloak of the Ice Bear (20 CR back), Crown of the Froglok Kings (20 CR head), White Gold Necklace (7 MR and CR neck), Runed Bone Fork (10 to all resists, range, melee), Drolvarg Mantle (10 MR shoulder) and there are plenty more. Take a look on some sites, you have a week!<br>
*Listen to the raid leader (Kelraz and someone else probably), listen to your group leader...you may know everything, but I know more! MUAHAHAHA. And in all seriousness...we may all die but all of us dying following directions is better than all of us dying running around with chickens with our heads cut off.<br>
*Loot: NBG, I'll post a loot breakdown in a second of who can roll on what but there is at least one item every class can roll on I am sure...if nothing else the gems she drops (sometimes a blue diamond, etc.) Sadly I have to ask that only raid participants are free to loot (45 - 52) with exceptions dealt with on a case by case basis. Final Destiny, however, is going to claim epic pieces for ourselves...if you were hoping for a scale and a book you can hope 2 drop and we open the 2nd to lotto, or simply come along for the experience and plan your own Vox raid for the following week. I will come, I love killing dragons =D <br>
<br>
Level 53+ fear not, you can help as well. Simply get to Halas early and bind, then come into Permafrost for groups. After I have you on the list (say at 8:10 or so) run back to Halas, agro a guard, die, repeat until you are level 52, and drag all your corpses to the zone entrance and put them in a nice pile. Be sure to bring items to leave on the corpses! After Vox dies or, worst comes to worst, if we fail, after our first attempt, I will have a cleric who bound in Halas log in and rez everyone with a 96% exp rez which will get you back to just about where you were when you started deleveling but you will still be able to participate. Casters have it better off, too, because you can bind in the prep room and delevel there...just a bit easier but either option works.<br>
<br>
That should be the rules, so here is the breakdown of what is gonna happen (this is getting long, sorry):<br>
8:00 - Last call for new arrivals<br>
8:30 - Giants cleared (mostly), groups formed, move to buff room<br>
8:35 - Begin buffing<br>
9:00 - Buffing finished, assault on Vox<br>
9:30 - Final Verdict (Did we get her?!?! Clerics move in to rez, rogues to drag if Vox lived)<br>
9:45 - Fully Rezzed, loot distribution or 2nd attempt<br>
<br>
I don't plan on needing a 2nd attempt, but it may happen and we are going to allow time for it. I will have clerics there with their epics to make rezzing extremely fast (thank you Final Destiny) so we will have a swift turn around. The one thing that kills these types of raids is most people go into the first battle without experience and then die, have a 2 hour CR and don't want to try again. That WON'T happen thankfully with all the added planning, support, etc.<br>
<br>
Before I bore you, here is the buffing:<br>
When buffing is called each group leader will decide how the first 3 junk buffs will be laid down. Many people suggest bard songs go as the first 2 buffs (I suggest all bards twist 2) or any instant proc items (Jboots, etc.) because they can be refreshed. I know bards need to sing mana during buffing so you can lay down disease resist and then have the whole group click it off just before the assault to let a bard song sit there. That way when the song is dispelled it will start up in a second later anyway. After all groups report 3 junk buffs laid down we will then rotate in clerics, druids, enchanters, shamans, etc. into all the groups to see that everyone has a max of 14 buffs including: HP and AC buffs, Strength, Haste, Clarity, and lastly Magic and Cold Resists. Cold being the most important as Vox uses an AoE Cold DD and then Magic secondly because of her AoE Fear. <br>
<br>
The Fight:<br>
Going to have the groups broken into 2 - 3 waves, the first waves primarily melee. The Melee will charge into the fight and all focus on one of Vox's sides...beating the snot out of her. At 60% we will call in the final wave(s), heavy casters to nuke her. Melee will continue to bash keeping her stunned so she can't complete heal while enchanters will be tapping and draining her mana. Hopefully we will have 5 enchanters to drain her before she gets a single complete heal off...though 1 CH we can deal with, 3 is a bit tough. After 3 rumor has it she can't get another off but I doubt many have lived that long. Hopefully she will die fast...she is weaker than Naggy just has the heal which makes her very tough. Also keep note that after the buff room there are pits with KOS bears at the bottom so when you get feared be very careful walking back or you may fall into the pit. Check a map before you come to see where those pits are.<br>
<br>
When she dies I will be rezzed fast and no one is allowed to loot unless given permission by me or the other raid leader(s). Loot to be up for lottery and the classes that can lotto on them. As last time Final Destiny reserves the right to take 1 White Scale and 1 Pally Book, but everything else (and maybe those items depending on bard / pally turnout and need) will be lottoed.<br>
<br>
Crystalline Spear, Piercing 13/30 - RNG/BAR/ROU/WAR<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
And of course Prickley Pears will drop for Shadowknights who can roll on them if they need em.<br>
<br>
I invite everyone to come to this event, and would like to get an idea of who is coming first if you could post below names, classes, levels, etc. I am going to set a soft level limit of 48 - 52 with a hard limit of level 45 - 52...level 45's will get slapped around but if the added people are needed of course we won't turn you away. We will not take more than 60 people into battle due to lag reasons, a mass LD would suck. Additionally we will not attempt without at least 4 clerics and 3 enchanters though hopefully we will have more of them! So post below, and can't wait to see you there =D <br>
<br>
Note: We are currently also working on an insentive for people who attended last weeks raid. We may have an additional bonus such that all repeat offenders get to roll /rand 1 600 while everyone else rolls /rand 1 500...but that isn't fully worked out yet.<br>

Question... if any books drop, will they be lottoed amongst Paladins or your guild holding? I know the chances of a book dropping are ultra rare, since VI doesn't want to make it easy for Paladins, but just thought I'd ask.<br>

Basically what this says is that Final Destiny will get the book and scale for its members if A) We have one of those members in attendence that needs, and B) Only one of each drops.  From my experience, around two thirds of the time that an epic item drops, there are 2 of that type (2 scales or 2 books), so if there is a multiple of the epic item, the second will be lottoed amongst those that need it.  Also, to clue you guys in, we do not have a huge amount of paladins or bards in our guild currently, and we may very well get all the epic items we need out of it, at which time we will have all epic items open lotto for those present who need for their epic quests.

P.S.S  Got a new puter with a Geforce 3, had some probs last time with screen lag and song timing.  Hope to see that is not a problem this time, and that my group makes it through the entire battle this time. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=bardsrule1169>BardsRule1169</A> at: 10/18/01 7:14:32 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ukelrazbladesinger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kelraz Bladesinger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/18/01 8:58:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=276.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lady Vox - Saturday 10/20 - 8:00 PM EST - Open Invite</span><hr size=1> Excellent!
