<br>
&quot;We gathered about 4 groups of Vision players and a group or so of non-Vision players and attacked and killed Severilous. Severilous dropped the Green Dragonscale (and a few other things). Allamar (an officer and warrior in Vision) decided that it was fair to have this warrior roll for the item against our warriors in exchange for his participation and for the tell that brought us to Emerald Jungle in the first place.&quot;<br>
<br>
From this post the chain of events points to the scale dropping, then you stopping to decide whether he should get to roll or not.<br>
<br>
Interestingly enough pali, you also say his tell brought you there to begin with )<br>
<br>
The timeframe was not cleared up until 2 1/2 pages later Allamar, when you posted. If that had been in the original post, i wouldn't have given it a second glance. As it was when you gave the time frame i said &quot;ah well that wasn't as bad as it sounded from pali's post.&quot;<br>
<br>
The problem is:<br>
<br>
&quot;We maintain Serv would have died with or without one extra Warlord.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Your warrior was certainly not needed&quot; (hey, he isn't my warrior its the priniciple)<br>
<br>
&quot;Vision was helping the warrior out if anything, NOT the other way around.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;His help was not needed, we could have killed the dragon just as easily without his help.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;his presense wasn't necessary&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;There is a difference between saying, &quot;We could have done it without you, so there!&quot; and, &quot;The raid would have been successful without your presence (a statement which probably applies individually to every raider  present)&quot; <br>
<br>
Every statement above is absolutely correct.<br>
<br>
Telling anyone at any raid ANY of it is a real jerkoff thing to do. In tells, on this board, whichever.<br>
<br>
I also agree with you pali, you didn't know who my guild was, strike that word from the post.<br>
<br>
You have NO objections to the rest of it and that's also my point. I flamed 0 people in 0 instances over the last 5 pages. How many of your members flamed me?<br>
<br>
Just like the fact that no one from your guild who has spoken up seems to agree with: <br>
<br>
*Telling anyone at any raid ANY of it is a real jerkoff thing to do.*<br>
<br>
And your guild(with the exception of allamar) has made a point to(instead of argue the above point) flame me, call me a moron, etc(all in my other post above, read it there).<br>
<br>
To me, thats about as much as I need to know about your guild overall. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/upalimaxsceleris.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Palimax Sceleris</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local Resident</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/15/02 2:01:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=804.topic&index=196>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Things you do after leaving a guild...</span><hr size=1> You've made it abundantly clear, that no matter how boneheaded it is, you're entitled to your opinion.<br>

<br>
Perhaps you shouldn't jump to conclusions and call me retarted so quickly. Here is why I asked you if you got your Kunark boss mobs confused:<br>
<br>
I was the ranger who got the Trakanon BP in the Vision-XA team up raid, where a Tolan's BP and an Elderspit's BP dropped. It seemed very odd that you mentioned the same types of dropps: ranger and druid for a VS raid which was never mentioned on our boards.<br>
<br>
The idea that I might have somehow cheated another of my class just made me a sad ranger. =( I would sooner cancel my account than cheat another of my class and have no intention to cancel my account at this time. Had you reply back say that you were mistaken and it was Trakanon, I would have suggested that you have your ranger friend talk to our class leader about the matter.<br>
<br>
<br>
I tend to go to practially every raid myself, though I have had to take some time off from playing recently due real life. [Do I even need to go into details here beyond that I have a computer with a defective video card? There are some days that I can't get anything to run.]<br>
<br>
<br>
So please don't jump to conclusions and call people retarded just because they do a brain fart check.<br>

EVERY time someone has asked for help in guildchat, people have assembled within the hour to help. Recently, I even asked for a lil help for my friend to do his epic piece. A group of Vision was there, though they didn't know him at all. <br>
If you even THINK about calling Vision greedy, think again...<br>
I don't know how many times I have seen people turn down HoT drops, even BPs, to give them to a member who needs it more. In Vision, I am treated fairly, and as an individual who attends raids when he can. I don't know any Vision who would not help me (if available) if I called on them and asked them for their help. <br>
Concerning Vision coming near break-up frequently:<br>
I have been in Vision for over a month, not a long time, but time enough to learn that there is no quarrels within the guild. In the month or so that I've been with the guild, I have seen no one ripping on each other (except if in jest) or saying &quot;I'm gonna leave the guild if things don't shape up soon&quot; or anything of the sort. In my opinion, Vision is a GREAT guild, one that respects its members and is always willing to help. Thank you Vision for letting me participate in this great family.<br>

I can't put it any more bluntly than my post before this one. If you can't get the gist from that I guess I'm never gonna explain it to you.
