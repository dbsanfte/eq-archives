<br>
This guy scammed me out of coin on a multi quest two weeks ago, and refuses to pay the complete amount of the MQ back. I have players telling me he was still auctioning a corroded plate helm after he had agreed to hold it for me if I payed a higher price than the current offer he had. Then add to that, when he finally gets online to do the MQ, he informs me that he has higher offers than what he had agreed to with me. I tell him that he agreed on a price, and he gives me the "whatever lets do it" bit. So he supposedly hands in his helm and the quest npc gives him the insufficient faction message of "I refuse to aid your kind". I immediately ask him if he has the correct faction and he assures me again he does. So I turn in my gems and poof, nothing happens. At this point he tells me he has to go, he cant stay any longer and gives me the coin back. Not knowing what the hell happened on his end, and seeing that he has the guildname Allied Giants on his character, I figure this cant be happening the way I see it, since they were a respectable guild as far as I had known. So I give him half of the coin back and tell him to hold onto it until I get more info on what just happened. At this point I couldnt believe this guy would scam me intentionally, he seemed nice (dont all scammers?) and he was in a well-known guild, but reality has a way of opening ones eyes sometimes.<br>
<br>
Either the next day or the day after, I finally get him to log into the game and check his faction... of course this time around he has the correct faction. Bummed out, I check into the matter more. After talking to people on the EQ boards, and 3 guides/gms, all of them agree that he didnt have the correct faction. Multiple people inform me that I just got scammed and looking back at the stuff he said and his refusal to pay the half of the coin back to a quest he clearly screwed up, I have no other choice but to agree. My mistake in this matter was clearly putting trust in the guild tag on this guys character.<br>
<br>
So Im out half the coin on the MQ, I dont have the helm he promised for the paid amount, and im out the 3 gems while this guy more than likely MQd the helm to the other late offer that was higher than mine. His refusal to pay the coin is based on his supposedly losing the helm. Like I had any influence on that. Something was wrong on his end, or he purposely screwed up, yet he thinks I should be the one to pay for it. After 20+ emails and talking with his guildleader, they refuse to do anything about the reimbursement for a quest he screwed up. <br>
<br>
My only satisfaction is that I am posting this warning here for all other would be buyers from this guy. I think its chickenshit for this guy to run around scamming people while they are under the impression he is in a reputable guild. I have done alot of MQs with people, I always understood (as all responsible MQers do) that it was my responsibility to replace or reimburse if I screwed up in the MQs. Appearantly Vanced feels since he screwed up, we both have to accept the losses. If I had turned in the items and it gave me the bad faction message, I guarantee I would have accepted the responsibility and taken whatever action necessary to appease the other guy that just got screwed. Regardless of what you think of me or him, the fact remains that the bug/glitch/mistake was made on his end, and he refuses to accept the responsibility, so Beware of this guy if you have any future interactions with him. And a little advice, if you see a guild tag after the would be MQers name, contact his gm first and ask if they cover any screw-ups on their end... it sure would have changed my mind about the MQer if I had known in this case that they wouldnt. If anyone in Allied Giants takes offense the naming of his guild, that is something he should have thought about before flying the tag when he was multi questing. I had no idea who this guy was, but I put my trust in the reputation of the tag he had on and I got burned due to it, since neither Vanced nor his gm will do anything about it.<br>
<br>
I would have posted this very disheartening crap earlier, however I was promised a email or a tell a week ago and no one bothered to do either... I had to track down the guildleader again to find out wtf is going on. <p><img src="http://members.home.net/moonie1/images/YIEsig.jpg" usemap="#YIEsig.jpg" border="0">

<br>
I guess when you get a message like that you should know that he does not have the correct version.<br>
<br>
I am sorry he did this to ya Yugo but it's kinda your own mistake to still hand in the gems after you see an obvious message like that.<br>
<br>
That however does not clear Vance of any blame ofcourse if in fact he tried to scam you.<br>

I dont mind losing the gems, I already replaced them since they were from a friend. I also got a helm this past weekend on a guild raid so the helm is also moot... its just a matter of the other half of the coin from the botched MQ. Trust is a tricky thing to gauge... and I got it wrong this time. Its a lesson learned, I will know what to look out for in the future, especially when I see that tag. Just tired of being told to be patient for two weeks to finally hear a no answer. The other pisser is the guy spent the coin immediately and that was why he initially refused to reimburse me. Life goes on. <p><img src="http://members.home.net/moonie1/images/YIEsig.jpg" usemap="#YIEsig.jpg" border="0">

I'm sorry that our decision isnt what you are seeking. I'm not here to debate anything although certainly this being on the NAG section means it has the possibility to go beyond what it is.<br>
<br>
Both you and Vanced had the right faction and this was proven the next day in which you accused Vanced of *fixin* his Faction from the time the MQ failed till next day which I think is absurd but your entitled to your opinion. MQ is MQ, it failed with whatever that message is which points to wrong faction which infact is not true since both had right faction.<br>
<br>
You told him that your taking responsibility for any failures but the message boggled you to dig deeper to the situation. You offered to split the 14k and that was it. Now you want it back and accused him of scamming you. You even told me some lame thing saying my guild harbors scammers which makes me shake my head. I could of forked up that 7k out of my own pocket if it was really a mistake on our part but from what I saw, there isnt a good reason to do so.<br>
<br>
My Guild may not be Ubber or be able to kill Ubber_mob_001 but I do believe weve earned a great amount of respect as a Guild and individual players in this community. I stand by our decision and behind Vanced. Im sorry you had to resolve to this but you do what you must. <p>

Even if no one replies, they still get moved here. If I copied it to the General section, would that make you happy? Would that change anyones mind about reimbursing my coin? Thought not, so enough with the banter about what section its in.<br>
<br>
I dont know if Vanced did have the correct faction, and I really dont care, the point of the matter is the problem was on his end. It doesnt matter if its his fault or the games fault, it was still on his end and thus its his responsibility. You and he both refuse to see that simple fact.<br>
<br>
As for your statement about me telling him I would take responsibility for "any failures" that is a untruth. I never said a thing along those lines. There is no way in hell I would even think of accepting ALL of the responsibility in a situation like that. Doing so would only make it even easier for someone to scam me and I refuse to do that. So your statement is either a flat out lie or you miscommunicated what you meant.<br>
<br>
Due to all the crap this guy has used to cover his ass in the deal, I can only assume he scammed me. First he claims he has the correct faction, says after the fact he has never MQd before, he is seen auctioing the helm after we agreed on a deal, tries to sucker me into trading him a 20-25k emerald scale straight up for the helm, says he has higher offers on the table when we finally meet to do the MQ, has to log immediately after his botched MQ, says he is going to email the head gm of our server and I never hear another word about that, finally logs in 5 emails and 1-2 days later to check his faction, and then informs me he already spent the coin so there will be no refunds. If the guy wont accept responsibility for a problem on his end, what else am I to assume? Who does he screw next time and say hey, I had no control over it, sorry, thanks for the 5k or 50k or 500k???<br>
<br>
"My Guild may not be Ubber or be able to kill Ubber_mob_001 but I do believe weve earned a great amount of respect as a Guild and individual players in this community."<br>
<br>
Yeah well, you just lost that respect in more than just my eyes. This whole situation is bullshit, and you can bet your ass I will never ever deal with another Allied Giants again, because if I do and shit hits the fan, I already know im fucked since they know they can get away with scamming and nothing will be done about it. <p><img src="http://members.home.net/moonie1/images/YIEsig.jpg" usemap="#YIEsig.jpg" border="0">

Well the only thing that molest me and thing that molest alot of AGs too is your form of get in our guild, you are moving the personal problems with one player to a guild with others and posting a problem with a person based in suppocitions, well i really dont know what did happend there and same than me alot of ppl that did or will read that post. So think a bit about that and dont use a guild for that thing, a guild cant do nothing when one person said a thing and other persont said the other thing, who need we listen and who need we thing that is saiding the true thing?<br>
<br>
Well Ill do only a suggestion, use that board for a constructive things man and try no molest the others persons that not got any thing to do in this problem.<br>
Note: AGs always WERE, ARE and WILL BE honorable guild that is our base of guild. If anyone know anything more that can add for said that we are not honorables, plz post it and let me know if dont, man just use the ussuals ways for this things and dont try use the guild names for that.<br>

<br>
and he didnt blame AG until another AG steps in and says the guild stands behind him.<br>
dont try to act like your guild is 100% pure and honest because it aint, i know a few AG and i like them but there are ALWAYS people in a guild no matter how good that are capable of doing bad things.<br>
<br>
if someone is selling a MQ then its his risk not the buyer since the buyer buys the end product, and a MQ will always work if done correct and all factions are as they should.<br>
remember this game is simply a computor generated code and it will not randomly cause a MQ to fail since id 1+2=3 one time it will be 3 the next time aswell if the MQ is done the same way, that is simply because the game engine calculates 1+2 as just 3 so if you give the NPC plate hem and the other person gives him the gems and both have the correct faction then the end result will be the quest item you wanted.<br>
the gamecode would have to be extremely smart to be able to forget what "plate hem + 3 unstacked crushed coral" makes<br>
the only hazard of MQ is on the player side.<br>
and its kinda not the point since the MQ was sold and therefore the buyer never recived the end result.<br>
<br>
however you start a nag about this over the loss of 3 common gems??? just add him to the asshole list and get on with your life.. if he turned in the plate part then he is in bigger loss then you are.<br>
 <br>
and again this is the nag board, made for harsh things and truly the place for these issues.<br>

<br>
If you are interested in doing a MQ with someone and its for a large amout of pp..I would suggest doing this.<br>
<br>
Have the MQ take a screen shot of the MQ item...silk boots, plat helm...in his possetion..next have the MQ hail the Quest npc and con him as well and take a screen shot of that..have him send that to you via- email and the other participant also..hail/con the quest NPC and send him his Screenshot..no doubt about it then?<br>
This could take a matter of a half hour in total time and should remove and questions or doubt on both partys sides. If it fails then..it sucks but things do happen..<br>

Ehrnam: &quot;Hail, quest mob_001.&quot;  <br>
Quest mob_001: &quot;How now brown ehrnam, ill make you phat lutes if j0re a cleric.&quot;  <br>

Ehrnam: &quot;hat&quot;<br>
Quest mob_001: Bring me a dirty cap and 3 rocks blah blah...<br>
<br>
If you have both members of the mq go thru the quest and the mob gives you the quest you know it will work.  You should also kill the quest mob if at all realistic to be sure noone gave the mob half of the quest already.  I know a cleric in my guild who has a nice pair of &quot;Shining Boots&quot; because someone turned in 3 gems before he and his sale got there.<br>
<br>
If the guy is selling the helm soon AFTER the MQ was supposedly fucked then he's full of shit, the quest peices are lore.  He prolly indended to do the MQ with you, went down there, conned a mob and found out that he didnt have the faction.  Felt like a fucking idiot, turned in ANYTHING (not the helm) got the shafted faction message (didnt realize he'd get that by turning in a summoned: globe of water! DOH) and had to log.  Next day went and worked his faction up a lvl or two and was auctioning to sell the helm again.  This is just the impression I got of the situation from how it was described here on the msg board.  MQ's always work if done correctly, thats all there is too it.  <p><a target href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=19803">Ehrnam Stormbynder</br></a>

<br>
                            Multi-questing is a dangerous thing. It simply doesn't always work. <br>
</i><br>
Palimax: <i><br>
How can you be so certain? <br>
</i><br>
I know the problem was on his end, because the npc said the incorrect faction message as soon as he said he turned in the helm. I even hesitated and asked again if he had the correct faction and his reply was yes. So I turned in the gems and recieved nothing.<br>
<br>
With that in mind, yes I would still consider it his fault if the game engine was the problem. If it had screwed up when I turned in the gems and gave me the message, you bet I would have been po'd, but I would still accept that something went wrong on my end and he would have the entire amount of coin. Thats the correct honest way to do MQs. Any other way leaves the door open for scammers to run amok.<br>
<br>
MQing isnt dangerous at all. If it was, people wouldnt pay so much coin for epic pieces. Besides, ive done well over 50 MQs in the Velious expansion alone, this is the first time one has gone awry, and it figures its the time when I am the one paying for it.<br>
<br>
Drakkon: <i>I am a RL Friend of Vanced and have been for almost 10 years. He would not try to scam you.</i><br>
<br>
His inaction has proved otherwise to me, im sorry I dont have luxury of knowing him for 10 years, ive only known him for 2 weeks and my opinion in the matter has been forced.<br>
<br>
Drakkon: <i>He is a rational and<br>
                            understanding person, something may be able to be worked out without anyone bashing anyone else.</i><br>
<br>
I tried working this out. I tried working this out for a week with Vanced. Then I tried working it out with his GM. Vanced wouldnt reimburse me because he spent the coin already, thats very rational and understanding. His GM simply forgot about it for a week and finally gave me a "No" when I had to remind him I wasnt going away without a answer. The rational and understanding way, of reimbursing me, would have never prompted this post.<br>
<br>
Ibudin: <i>Have the MQ take a screen shot of the MQ item..</i><br>
Ibudin, your suggestion while a bit of a hassle, might be what I desire next time when working with medium sized amounts of coin. I could have taken the precautions you described, but as I have stated before, I wasnt really worried about the deal going sour, simply because of the tag flying behind his name. I wouldnt expect a deal going sour if a player was flying the tag of any of the commonly known guilds out there. Thats part of being a "known" guild... it does bestow a reputation on any of its members. The reputation that preceeded AG was one that made me feel secure in the deal... hense the reason I didnt do what I could have to protect myself better in the situation.<br>
<br>
Ehrnam: <i>If you both walk up to the quest mob and hail him and run through a little of the quest text, you'll know<br>
                            if either of you have the faction. </i><br>
True Ehrnam, I had checked the npc to make sure I had the gems correct (I always do this) and Vanced told me he had the correct faction, so I took his word for it and payed no more notice to that part of the quest... I will never make the mistake of taking someones word on faction again.<br>
<br>
Ehrnam: <i>I know a cleric in my guild who has a nice pair of "Shining Boots" because someone<br>
                            turned in 3 gems before he and his sale got there.</i><br>
Items turned into the quest npcs, only remain for a small amount of time, If I remember correctly... around 5 minutes. Your cleric got lucky to get there in time. :)<br>
<br>
Ehrnam: <i>If the guy is selling the helm soon AFTER the MQ was supposedly fucked then he's full of shit, the quest<br>
                            peices are lore.</i><br>
Naw, not after, at least I didnt see him doing it after, the auctioning I was talking about was after he agreed to hold them for me. He sent me tells when I was pulling for a guild hunt in Chardok... I informed him that I wouldnt be able to leave for some time, he said if I payed a inflated price he would hold them for me no matter what. I agreed to the inflated price and it was after we came to that agreement, that I was informed he was selling a MQ for the helm since I had people looking out for a MQ for me while I was in Chardok. That should have set off bells in my mind, but I was just happy to get the quest and didnt want to piss him off by pushing the issue.<br>
<br>
Ehrnam: <i>MQ's always work if done correctly, thats all there is too it.</i><br>
I agree 100%. I have done about 16 more MQs since this incident, and none have failed.<br>
<br>
Darus: <i>If he was selling a helm soon after then he never turned in the original at all...they're lore, and i doubt<br>
                            he looted another one within the next day.</i><br>
See above, sorry guys, I must have miscommunicated the timeframe on the reports of him still taking offers on the helm. I will check back and see where I swerved off track on that one.<br>
