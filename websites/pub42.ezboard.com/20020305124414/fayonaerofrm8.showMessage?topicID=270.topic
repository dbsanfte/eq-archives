I hope everyone can attend, should be fun since a lot of people never ran a successful Vox run and that can turn you off to the whole concept...but I wanna prove to you all it can (and will) be done! My last run on her (not as a leader but a peon) we got amazingly close before she got her 3rd Complete Heal off with far less people than I imagined would even get that close...but she is fierce. First, a breakdown of the rules:<br>
<br>
*Must be in Permafrost by 8:00 PM EST (5:00 PM PST). I am going to make the groups at that point exactly, not even arrivals at 8:01 will be taken. We will have the firepower in zone I am sure so no need to screw around waiting for people.<br>
*Melee must have a shield with them. The key to killing Vox is keeping her manaless and bashed up against the corner.<br>
*Resist GEAR! This can't be stressed enough and a lot of people overlook this. I am going to ask that everyone have at least 100 points of cold and magic resists UNBUFFED. This is especially critical for bards, enchanters, and clerics as these classes getting feared can screw their whole group or the raid. Bark Potions are not required but can be helpful turning a fear into a stun (they cast root on you, get some in case). Easy resist gear is Cloak of the Ice Bear (20 CR back), Crown of the Froglok Kings (20 CR head), White Gold Necklace (7 MR and CR neck), Runed Bone Fork (10 to all resists, range, melee), Drolvarg Mantle (10 MR shoulder) and there are plenty more. Take a look on some sites, you have a week!<br>
*Listen to the raid leader (Kelraz and someone else probably), listen to your group leader...you may know everything, but I know more! MUAHAHAHA. And in all seriousness...we may all die but all of us dying following directions is better than all of us dying running around with chickens with our heads cut off.<br>
*Loot: NBG, I'll post a loot breakdown in a second of who can roll on what but there is at least one item every class can roll on I am sure...if nothing else the gems she drops (sometimes a blue diamond, etc.) Sadly I have to ask that only raid participants are free to loot (45 - 52) with exceptions dealt with on a case by case basis. Final Destiny, however, is going to claim epic pieces for ourselves...if you were hoping for a scale and a book you can hope 2 drop and we open the 2nd to lotto, or simply come along for the experience and plan your own Vox raid for the following week. I will come, I love killing dragons =D Have a necromancer at the raid and I'll sacrifice myself down to 52 for them, too!<br>
<br>
That should be the rules, so here is the breakdown of what is gonna happen (this is getting long, sorry):<br>
8:00 - Last call for new arrivals<br>
8:30 - Groups formed, on the move to giants<br>
9:20ish - Giants pulled, move in to buff room<br>
9:30 - Begin buffing (detailed below)<br>
9:45 - Assault on Vox (detailed below)<br>
10:15 - Final Verdict (Did we get her?!?! Clerics move in to rez, rogues to drag if Vox lived)<br>
10:45 - Fully rezzed, loot or 2nd attempt<br>
<br>
I don't plan on needing a 2nd attempt, but it may happen and we are going to allow time for it. I will have clerics there with their epics to make rezzing extremely fast (thank you Final Destiny) so we will have a swift turn around. The one thing that kills these types of raids is most people go into the first battle without experience and then die, have a 2 hour CR and don't want to try again. That WON'T happen thankfully with all the added planning, support, etc.<br>
<br>
Before I bore you, here is the buffing:<br>
When buffing is called each group leader will decide how the first 3 junk buffs will be laid down. Many people suggest bard songs go as the first 2 buffs (I suggest all bards twist 2) or any instant proc items (Jboots, etc.) because they can be refreshed. I know bards need to sing mana during buffing so you can lay down disease resist and then have the whole group click it off just before the assault to let a bard song sit there. That way when the song is dispelled it will start up in a second later anyway. After all groups report 3 junk buffs laid down we will then rotate in clerics, druids, enchanters, shamans, etc. into all the groups to see that everyone has a max of 14 buffs including: HP and AC buffs, Strength, Haste, Clarity, and lastly Magic and Cold Resists. Cold being the most important as Vox uses an AoE Cold DD and then Magic secondly because of her AoE Fear. <br>
<br>
The Fight:<br>
Going to have the groups broken into 2 - 3 waves, the first waves primarily melee. The Melee will charge into the fight and all focus on one of Vox's sides...beating the snot out of her. At 60% we will call in the final wave(s), heavy casters to nuke her. Melee will continue to bash keeping her stunned so she can't complete heal while enchanters will be tapping and draining her mana. Hopefully we will have 5 enchanters to drain her before she gets a single complete heal off...though 1 CH we can deal with, 3 is a bit tough. After 3 rumor has it she can't get another off but I doubt many have lived that long. Hopefully she will die fast...she is weaker than Naggy just has the heal which makes her very tough. Also keep note that after the buff room there are pits with KOS bears at the bottom so when you get feared be very careful walking back or you may fall into the pit. Check a map before you come to see where those pits are.<br>
<br>
When she dies I will be rezzed fast and no one is allowed to loot unless given permission by me or the other raid leader(s). We will rez everyone, roll on the loot, and all go away happy and rich! Remeber to take screen shots, gonna be exciting.<br>
<br>
I invite everyone to come to this event, and would like to get an idea of who is coming first if you could post below names, classes, levels, etc. I am going to set a soft level limit of 48 - 52 with a hard limit of level 45 - 52...level 45's will get slapped around but if the added people are needed of course we won't turn you away. We will not take more than 60 people into battle due to lag reasons, a mass LD would suck. Additionally we will not attempt without at least 4 clerics and 3 enchanters though hopefully we will have more of them! So post below, and can't wait to see you there =D <p><img src="http://eagle2.american.edu/~ch4890a/kelsig.jpg"><br>

Resist gear is not a problem.<br>

If there is not enough room for me in the raid and you just need additional manpower for buffing or another role, I will be glad to help there as well.<br>

I am just looking to get involved.<br>

And also....I have never...ever...seen a BASH interupt her spellcasting...I could be wrong...but after 15 raids on her im fairly sure bash is useless.<br>

The key is to have many ENCs as you can to manasieve her....or..just be lucky and she wastes it all on nukes =)<br>

Else I am trying to figure out if there are anyone still alive =D However I feel it is better safe than sorry so we should still try the mass bash technique because that is the technique I have followed on my past raids and I have won...so it is possible!<br>
<br>
Secondly, I am getting pretty excited about the run...should be a good time. I also hope that if this is successful we can keep something going, similar to what Darus used to run. Future raids loot rules will be different and attendance will be taken depending on what happens...but anyway 6 days till she dies! <p><img src="http://eagle2.american.edu/~ch4890a/kelsig.jpg"><br><center>

Dragons are &quot;big&quot;, and you can't stun &quot;big&quot; things =)  The two options are moving her a great deal with focused melee (does not work very often) or mana sieving. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uarenia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arenia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/8/01 4:47:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=270.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lady Vox - Friday 10/12 @ 8:00 PM EST - Open Invite</span><hr size=1> Hello to u all From EoCC.

I mean they will be contributing in Vox's death also.  Just a thought.<br>

I'll let you know as the week goes on how many more we can provide. Our allies, Silent Chaos may well provide some Melee and clerics also. This will be good experience for our guilds to learn how to do a dragon raid.<br>
