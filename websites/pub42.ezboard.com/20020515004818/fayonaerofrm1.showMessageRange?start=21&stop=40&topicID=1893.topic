<br>
I'm not the best of rangers, as I freely admit.. but the way that I'm used by my guild atm I can probably describe.<br>
<br>
If no other snarer is present, I snare and then jolt my arse off..<br>
<br>
I give all groups CoP and then scream at the pallies for eating up my warders protection with divine strength or that god damn brell.. which usually ends with me just keeping Warders memmed or switch to the old bufffs..<br>
<br>
If it's outdoors, I end up pulling alot.<br>
<br>
On big targets, depending on their AC and how they're standing (ie. is it an open area - can I possibly use the bow?) if there's enough room for me to do so I stand back and use trueshot, if the mobs have too much AC so that I just get frustrated I run up and turn on autoattack instead.<br>
<br>
As it is now, I count as a damage dealer with the rogues and monks, so what my guild wants me to do is .. tadaaa damage =) <p><IMG SRC="http://user.tninet.se/~mhf993y/anna/wanwan1.jpg">

Most of these apply to situations where you are either the backup enchanter, or are fighting in a situation where you are not being<br>
totally consumed by crowd control duties.<br>
<br>
1)  If you're short on shaman power, for Tunare's sake, SLOW!  If you have a shaman, and they're having trouble landing when the mob is tashed/malosi'd (they are lower level than the mob/you), don't hesitate - even the fast and cheap Tepid Deeds (50% slow) is MUCH better than watching your melees get shredded.<br>
Keep this spell in your lineup unless you are absolutely SURE you won't need it.  If you're the backup chanter there's no reason you can't fit this in, and you should have a strip/pillage enchantment loaded as well, your main CC is most likely going to be too busy to handle this.<br>
<br>
2)  If your shaman or you know you are going to have trouble landing on a particularly hard hitting mob,  - Tash as soon as humanly possible (as soon as the MT has gotten a couple of rounds in).  Taking the tash agro can suck, and be fatal, but against large mobs the death of your MT due to lack of debuffing is much, much worse.  If it's mainly your nukers complaining about difficulty landing, the tash can wait a few rounds.<br>
<br>
3) A great tip (courtesy of someone, I don't remember who, from Lost Fires) regarding chain-runing:<br>
Hopefully, you're going to be chain-runing only your MT.  But often, you're a fair distance from that sort of fight, the MT dies, and if you're unlucky the ST dies.  Agro has fallen upon a backup pally or SK, or more likely some poor squishy monk rogue or ranger who is doing too much damage for their own good.  What do you do?  Make a hotkey /assisting the offending mob (erm, do this *before* the fight), and Rune whomever he's wailing on.  Voila, you've become a backup cleric.  But be sure you spell the monster's name right <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
4) Stripping of buffs (done by you):  Two things here.  1) If mobs have a DS or other buffs on them, and it's not absolutely *critical* that that mob get slowed IMMEDIATELY, yank those suckers off!  Classes who use fast weapons can get eaten alive by even small damage shields, and the amount of damage they can do to an entire raiding party is huge, straining healer resources.  2) This spell line can be invaluable if, god forbid, your MT gets charmed (happens fairly often in mid-level encounters) or someone gets a really horrendous DoT.  If this happens, ignore the crying about their lost haste (you're going to have to do it again soon anyway) - get that party member back to working for the team!  If this is a chronic problem, use a junk buff as the first buff, and then have the party remove it, thus making sure the buff you strip is the 'problem' one.<br>
<br>
Stripping of buffs (done by mobs):  This is a major pain in the butt.  What can you do?  Ideally, you should be stunlocking them, but resists happen, and you may not be able to get to the offending creature(s) right away.<br>
Junk Junk Junk!!  Carry stacks of fish scales for EB if you have to, other classes (druids and shamen are especially good for junking) can help with this.  Passing out a round of See Invis and Ultravision every couple of minutes is much less painful than redoing that C2 (or much worse, KEI) and Haste... not to mention the poor Clerics and Shamen who are crying/canni'ing themselves into oblivion.<br>
<br>
That's about all I can think of at the moment.  As I said in the first post, flexibility is the key; if you can adapt quickly to changing circumstances, this will save your butt many more times (at least at the early raid level) than searching for that 'perfect' lineup or strategy will.  And when all else fails, remember the mantra of my cleric friend and I:  &quot;The damage you prevent may be far more important than the damage you do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bleh, I'll shut up now.<br>

<br>
Pullin' and splitting.  (I am talking about mobs here...pervs.) That's what monks is for.  For every blue of XP I eat, that's one less blue bub for every member of the raid to potentially lose.  Tough splits, even if you die, are what it's all about.  If you get the split, and you or your chainer walks back with the number specified...it's Miller time.<br>
<br>
If I ain't pullin', then I just punch things.  Not nearly as exciting, but you can spice things up by setting your assist key to the enchanter from time to time.<br>
<br>
Remember, monks never really die.<br>

<br>
Snare sometimes, but with rangers and other druids there's a dozen other sources for snaring the mob, Epic if the battle is long enough to merit it.<br>
<br>
Typically as a druid I find myself spot healing.  Importantly, I toss Chloroblasts at our poor enchanters when they need it, other casters that took the agro a little too soon... Depending on the situation I'll also keep an eye out for other tanks who've gone into berserker frenzies, ect.  I try to keep an eye on friends as well but sometimes its more important to keep the group enchanter/shaman alive than Spite =*(<br>
<br>
Aside from spot heals, I keep Fixation and Ro's Fiery in the lineup provided that fire debuffing is feasible, and if that works well and mana is up I'll nuke like hell.  <br>
<br>
That pretty much does it for druids, depending on how large scale the raid is and where agro is focused, DSing is good, debuffage is good and spot heals are probably most imprtant in my book. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/urolielkotn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RolielKotN</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(3/4/02 4:05:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1893.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What I can do on raids</span><hr size=1> Kelraz, I'm pretty sure Niv's Melody of Preservation doesn't increase AC or ATK (well, not directly - since some str is given, your ATK will go up). I'll check when I log on tonight, but I'm nearly 99.9% sure of this. Doesn't make it a worthless song though, I sing it quite often, as it's regen effect (and the fact that it stacks with Cantata) makes it very worthwhile.<br>
<br>
Okay, now for what I think bards are good for on raids. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
1.) AE resists. Probably our most noticable benefit to raids, these songs kick ass. They give 105-ish to MR and CR/FR or DR/PR (depending on which song you use, and what kind of drums you have - non-magical drums would have it at 90, no drums would have it at 45).<br>
<br>
2.) Mana/hp/sta regeneration. AE or not, still a great song.<br>
<br>
3.) Resistance Debuffs. Occulsion of Sound debuffs 25 MR, CR, and FR, is unresistable, and requires a drum to be equipped. This is good for helping casters land nukes and slow, and if needed, helping your enchanter land their mez (I don't see bards working with chanters very often, we can help them out quite a bit). Also, if you're not 55+, you can use the Target Dots to debuff MR, FR, or CR, however you're usually singing something else.<br>
<br>
4.) Damage Shields. Bards can provide a more powerful damage shield than any other class (which doesn't matter - it all stacks anyways, I just like to brag about bards <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). At level 58, with a Vox horn and a Singing Steel bracer, a bard can get a DS of 37, which stacks with other class's DS's as well. SS bracer = 9 pt DS, Psalm of Warmth/Cooling = 10 pt DS, and McVax's Berzerker Crescendo = 16 pt DS. With an epic (or amplifacation, I haven't tested it with that yet), you can add an 80% bonus to Psalm of Warmth/Cooling.<br>
<br>
5.) Damage absorption. Shield of Songs can be nice for longer fights. With a Lute of the Howler, I think it absorbs about 44 points of damage. Last night my guild fought a mob with a considerable amount of hp, so my group was setup like this: Me, lvl 58 bard, Moonrunner 60 war, Gnevic 60 cleric, Brenye 57 cleric, Jesslynn 55 cleric, and Zionna 53 cleric. I sang Cantata and 2 rounds of Shield of Songs. Cantata helped a lot with regen, and Shield of Songs absorbed some of the damage that Moonrunner was taking, and some of the damage that the clerics were taking by using mod rods (works with Cannibalize too).<br>
<br>
6.) Stackable haste. Battlecry/Warsong of the Vahshir (lvl 52 and 60, respectively) are absolutely wonderful songs. They stack with chanter/shaman haste, and our other songs. Great for melee-heavy groups.<br>
<br>
7.) Tanking! Erm, wait. Let the warriors do that, it makes 'em feel important. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
8.) Mana Sieve, /shrug. We can do it, it's not very powerful. I might sing this song if we're short on chanters for MS, or if I'm having trouble thinking of something else to sing. Since the lvl 57 int/wis debuff lowers total the total mana pool, it's nice to sing at the beginning of the fight. Even just one round of it will still effect the mob after it wears off, since the mob would need to regain the mana lost by it's int/wis debuff after it wore.<br>
<br>
9.) Charming. If the bard times their charm well, it's a nice tool for zones like Kael where mobs cannot be mezzed, but are still charmable. Even if a chanter is present, it *might* be worth it for the bard to charm so the chanter can keep their mana up for haste/clarity. Also, we can take a lot more of a beating than chanters can, and have a discipline for 15 seconds of auto-dodge if we're risking death.<br>
<br>
10.) Pulling. Yes, you heard me - pulling. While we're rarely the pulling choice, we often can be. Think of zones where you raid, and are possibly not KoS. Right now, I'm ally in Skyshrine. If I chose to hose that faction and raid there, I would make one hell of a puller. What's the trick? Charm. If you charm something and it's not KoS, it's buddies won't aggro on you since it's your pet. I could split one mob from twenty, I'd like to meet a monk capable of that. One thing that sucks though, is having it resisted. If that's the case, you obviously won't get a single pull. Also, a lot of zones have uncharmable mobs.<br>
<br>
11.) Group Divine Aura. I don't think this needs an explanation. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Kelraz, you sound knowledgable of our class, but I thought I'd give you my thoughts anyways. Good luck making your Raiding Guide, I'd like to see it when it's done. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><IMG SRC=http://www.tiannathomas.com/images/roliel3.gif>

<br>
1. Damagedealer.<br>
 Allways go with the long DoTs (if no mini targets Juggs aso) start out with Splurt then cast Bloodline. If no CHC cast DoT heal on MT and Vex target. If the target resist doTs life tapp all u got.(on OF 1 Necro can deal 65 000 damage just by DoTs) You can do CE to It use to stick on any target.<br>
<br>
2. CC<br>
 Well you got ST and a line of root, use em to help chanter if mess breaks and he getts his axx kicked.<br>
<br>
3. Healer<br>
 Well you can heal 1 player for 1600 in one Vex do it. Allso if you are 60 you got the party life tap that heals 1080.<br>
<br>
4. Buffer.<br>
 Well you got the new party buffs (30+ STR/STA; 35 ATK and 18 AC ) Alsso got a poisonresist buff that adds 70+ vs poison.<br>
<br>
5. Manadealer /sigh<br>
 Well no fun but can save a raide.<br>
Chanter/Cleric oom if you are in his party start by cast the party manadrain will give all in the party 300 mana over 30 sec, when this is done start pump mana and soon the chanter/Cleric will be 50 mana+ and you just saved the raide.<br>
<br>
6. Resser<br>
 When you se that the raide is going to get a Wipe FD direct and log. When you get back just ress in the Cleric and you are GTG again.<br>
<br>
7. Puller<br>
 Don't think that you can't be a puller on a tricky pull. You got 2 invunreble (SP) spells and FD. Who do you think is the one who should pull Trakanon to his killspot?? (And as necro HP is the thing to go for after int)<br>
<br>
7. CR<br>
 Well just sone in and start summon the corpse 20 min later you are gtg.. (No 4h CRs here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
8. Petclass.<br>
 Well in exp partys ur pet rock hard but in raides with loots of OTM keep em in the backpack.<br>

Bellow's range is sooooooo short; I used to use it to finish off HG's when I wasn't high enough for chant of flame, and I could barely sing it on them and stay out of their melee range.<br>
<br>
Those DoT's used to be some of my favirote songs. Sub-50, I could outdamage warriors by meleeing with weapons and swapping in a drum for the DoT's. With Selo's Drums of the March, I think they do about 175-200 damage a tick (forget exactly, been a while since I've tested it). At level 46, that's some pretty serious damage. <p><IMG SRC=http://www.tiannathomas.com/images/roliel3.gif>

I can't really define what I do on a raid. I just do it without analyzing it.<br>

<br>
I'm a fairly new raider I've only begun raiding the last couple months so My experiance is small. However here are some of the things Rangers bring to the raid group.<br>
<br>
1. Snare - I'm usually always snaring or back up snaring<br>
<br>
2. Buffing - Rangers have a very good array of buffs and more often than not I feel like a shamman than a melee Generaly I'm throwing out a wide variety of buffs not only on my group but on the entire raid party.<br>
<br>
3. Tracking - If its not a raid on a specific target but say a place like fear ect.. I'm constantly checking track to find any spawns of intrest to my raiding party<br>
<br>
4. If its outdoors - A ranger makes an excellent puller in any outdoor zone and although I've yet to be a puller on a raid I would feel comfortable doing so and have seen other rangers pull on outdoor raid zones.<br>
<br>
5. Harmony Pulling in certain cases the ranger is needed to harmony pull in tricky situtions.<br>
<br>
6. Melee damage - this is so low on my list cause its just so obvious our melee damage is always a plus on the raid.<br>
<br>
7. Peeling Rangers can make excellent peelers <br>
<br>
8. Tanking, although we'll 95% of the time be the 4rth or 5th tank down the line somtimes were needed in this capacity and I would say that no other tanking class can hold agro as well as a ranger somtimes thats a benifit to the clerics who don't want to heal everyone a little bit but say one person a lot.  As well at level 60 I'm told that our Disc.  Weponshield has some pretty excellent usues against some of the more uber mobs in the game. (PS I wouldn't know yet I'm not 60)<br>
<br>
9. Top up healer, once a ranger hits 57 we get a decent heal spell and with Regen we can be counted on to do some basic after battle clean up healing to save the mana of the clerics on the raid.<br>
<br>
10.  Die - its a poor joke that rangers die a lot, infact with spells like jolt and the proper use of wepons if a ranger really wanted he could probably make sure everyone else died first however when its needed I don't know one good ranger that won't take one for the team.<br>
<br>
Thats about all I can think of there are always the little things you do but I think I covered a lot of what I've seen or done with a ranger on a raid. <p><a

<br>
as for CRing, i hate that BS ( especially when your in hate with your guild and some newb gets agro and without dieing dies at entrance where everyone just ported in and everyone dies except me, (Yet i was extremely tempted to die so i didn't have to drag these about 40 corpses to SS to the only living 57 cleric)<br>
