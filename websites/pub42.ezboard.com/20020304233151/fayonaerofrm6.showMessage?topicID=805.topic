Line from that article: "<i>There are lots of reasons for and against it...</i>[arming pilots].<br>
<br>
I sat and thought for a couple minutes, and I'm trying to think what the "lots of reasons against it" were and came up with nothing.  Maybe I'm biased, maybe I'm just not thinking hard enough, but my big question is...under what circumstances would an armed crew have been negative on the three flights that crashed on Sept. 11?  What is bad about an armed flight crew? <p>Faust<BR>

<br>
   1)  Any armed crew member could be disarmed by a potential hijacker who could then use the firearm against other crewmembers or passangers.<br>
<br>
   2)  Firefights at 10,000+ feet are very very bad.  Bullets can fairly easily penetrate the hull of most commercial airliners.  A hole the size of a quarter in the hull of a plane flying at 12,000 feet would quickly become a much larger hole as the cabin decompresses.  This could result in passengers and crew being sucked out of the plane.  This would also result in a tremendous (not to mention extremely rapid) loss of altitude.<br>
<br>
   3)  Firefights at 10,000+ feet are very very bad.  Picture armed crew and armed hijackers firing at each other across a cabin full of unarmed passnegers.<br>
<br>
   4)  Costs.  Imagine trying to buy handguns for every member of a single airline company.  And then having to pay to have those crewmembers trained in the use of firearms.  Then think of what said airlines insurance rates would be like.<br>
<br>
And those reasons are just the ones I can think of without putting any real amount of thought into the subject.<br>

The pilots should have a choice, whether they want to have them or not. Also, the cockpits should be sealed from the passengers/flight attendants.<br>

The pilots who wish to carry sidearms should go through training and certification, just like law enforcement currently does. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ufeuerfaust.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Feuerfaust</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/10/02 6:22:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=805.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://24.116.149.140/burt.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Planes and Guns</span><hr size=1> <a href="http://www.safetyslug.com/FAQs.htm" target=new>Technology is out there.</a><br>

Hmm, suicidal terrorists getting control of a plane and then being shot down by the military before further damage is done, or taking a chance of the skin on an aircraft being punctured?  Sidewinders tend to be less forgiving than 9mm's on aircraft skin. <p>Faust<BR>

<br>
Do I think crewmembers should be armed? No.  And maybe.  Flight attendants should NOT be armed.  We dont want these people engaging in a firefight with possible terrorists with the passengers caught in the crossfire.  The pilot, co-pilot, and navigator COULD be armed.  But they should be behind a secured reinforced door which is locked at all times and can only be opened from the inside.  If hijackers have no access to the pilot/flight control cabin then having the pilot etc being armed is a little redundant.  But in case hijackers DO gain access to the flight control cabin, a little redundancy couldnt hurt.<br>

I hate to trivialize death, but...  ...that's so amazingly shortsighted that I don't know where to begin.<br>
<br>
My only fault was that the original poster couldn't think of a SINGLE REASON why it MIGHT be bad to arm a flight crew.  I don't have an issue with armed marshals, for example, on a plane.  Happens all the time.<br>
<br>
I just think it's foolish to think that if you list the PROs and CONs of the &quot;arm the flight crew&quot; discussion that there is nothing in the CONs list. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4868>Palimax Sceleris</a>,

Couple of points of information on arming crews and possibly passengers on<br>
commercial flights<br>
<br>
1. Puncturing the skin of the aircraft. A few aeronautical engineers have taken a look at this over the<br>
    years for the military. Planes can be punctured many times and not lose discernable  integrity.<br>
<br>
    Sky Marshals are equipped with special Fragable ammo. It penetrates human skin but not the<br>
    skin of aircraft. This type of ammunition would also decrease the potential of collateral damage<br>
    during a firefight. It would be simple to equip flight crews with the same ammunition.<br>
<br>
2. Training. Most flight crews are ex-military and so have basic small arms training. Since Sept 11, 2001<br>
    several private Firearm Training companies have offered FREE training to any pilot who wants it.<br>
    Front Site being just one of these companies.<br>
<br>
3. Accidental discharge. Based on NSC, CDC and Insurance Industry data, the chance for a person trained in<br>
   Firearms to accidentally discharge a weapon is extremely small (you are more likely to be injured by <br>
   suffocation during swallowing [National Safety Councils &quot;1997 Accident Fact Book&quot; which is the most recent<br>
   year available to me]. Add the fragable ammo to the equation and it becomes a non-issue.<br>
<br>
4. Hijacker disarming crew member. Of the 2.5 million defensive gun uses every year, the percentage of<br>
    criminals who disarm the victim is less then 3%. Consider that you are far more likely to survive<br>
    a violent encounter if you are armed. In cases where there was injury to a robbery victim, injury to<br>
    the victim occurred in the following percentages: victim resisting with a gun 6%, victim did nothing <br>
    at all 25%, victim resisted with a knife 40%, victim took a non-violent stance 45%. <br>
<br>
5. Costs to arm pilots and flight crews. Most flight crews are ex-military. Most ex-military I know have<br>
   personal firearms. Costs would depend on whether standardization was required for arming the crew or if<br>
   they would be allowed to use personal sidearms. Even if the airline or government required standardization,<br>
   a decent semi-automatic can be purchased for $650 (Think Glock 30 here). Add costs for practice<br>
   (say 5,000 rounds a year and bi-weekly trips to the range) and you have a flight crewperson equipped<br>
   initially for less then $3,000 the first year and $2,000 for each year after. This assumes standard retail<br>
   prices which I am certain would be less for a mass purchase.<br>
   If groups decided to reload, you can drop the practice costs by half. <br>
   <br>
   I have no idea what insurance rates would be. However, I doubt they would be prohibitive as EL AL<br>
   commercial pilots/crew have been armed for years. Anyone remember the last time an EL AL flight was<br>
   hijacked?<br>
<br>
Some of the info comes from:<br>
<br>
   &quot;More Guns, Less Crime&quot; by Prof John Lott<br>
<br>
   &quot;Seven Myths of Gun Control&quot; by Richard Poe<br>
<br>
Before anyone just says &quot;Brynie= NUT&quot; let me relate a personal experience. When I first moved into<br>
my current home, I has robbed twice while I was at home in bed. In the second case, I called the local<br>
sheriffs while the robber was still present. The sheriffs took 20 min to respond. Thankfully the robber stayed to the living room for 5 min before departing with some serious electronics.t. <br>
<br>
Because of this I decided to research obtaining a firearm (forget alarms as it was obvious the police were<br>
not going to go come any faster). I read for 6 months, crunched numbers from various studies and<br>
had my father (ex professor of statistics &amp; research methodology and a LONG TIME GUN HATER) review<br>
the same studies. We independently came to the same conclusion, that the research about gun ownership<br>
decreasing and deterring crime was accurate and compelling.<br>

But maybe that sound strange to people living in a society where its getting normal bringing a gun to school and shoot the people you dont like. <br>
<br>
Anyway: <br>
* Rebuilding planes to be bullet-proof would cost aLOT, and that cost would come out on the ticket-prices. Are the customers ready to pay that cost?<br>
<br>
* I don't think the terrorists equip themselves with special FRAG ammo not to rupture the planes hull.<br>
<br>
* Pilots should fly, not play Doc Holliday.<br>
<br>
* Who would screen the pilots? <br>
<br>
* If the pilots are involved in not getting disarmed/shooting terrorists etc who is flying the plane? Maybe the cabin crew should get pilot-training. <br>
<br>
And finally I would like to point out that if it for some reason becomes impossible to hijack an airliner, a determined terrorist will find another way. For example stuffing a truck full of dynamite and parking it outside a federal building. Not as spectacular but it'll do the job. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=orontes>Orontes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/10/02 10:01:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=805.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Cons for everyone</span><hr size=1> Let's see, five realistic &quot;Cons&quot;- only took me 15 seconds.<br>
<br>
1. Who will watch the watchers?  I dunno about you, but I know some flight attendants in RL- no way in hell I trust them with a gun, training or not, they're freaks.  While I'm sure that pilots are more reliable than that, there are bound to be a few less than perfect examples out there.<br>
<br>
2.  Once again, I can see arming the flight crew- maybe- but if you think that someone would have trouble unholstering a person walking down the narrow passageway of coach class, think again.  <br>
<br>
3.  Given all the arguments I have seen, what does arming anyone on the plane do that simply making the flight deck inaccessible doesn't do much better?<br>
In light of September 11th, I have a feeling that it would be pretty much impossible to get that door opened by threat.  Seems it would be cheaper too, given that any scenario involving giving out handguns also involves armoring the door.<br>
<br>
4.  Why are handguns better than martial arts training?  <br>
<br>
5.  You don't think that the flight crew, if armed, might not get the &quot;police state&quot; mentality, and start looking for threats where none exist?  It is a well documented phenomena among police officers, I'll have to find some cites.<br>
<br>
Have a good flight<br>

I am not talking about arming the stewwies.  I'm sure there are some nice onces, and some smart ones out there (I'm even friends with one, and she's pretty smart), but overall my impression of flight attendants is that they, for the most part, are not the most "on the ball" group of people.  I dunno about arming them.<br>
<br>
I am talking about the <i>flight crew</i>, you know...the people that FLY the plane?  Not the <i>cabin crew</i> that get drinks, and show you how to use the seatbelts.<br>
<br>
Yes, strenghten the door.  That's the plan already.  Put guns (with Glaser Safety Slugs, for less chance of putting a hole in the aircraft) in the cockpit, and lock it down.  If, for some reason, a hijacker manages to get in, the crew at least has a chance of that last-ditch effort to stop a repeat of Sept 11.<br>
<br>
Before you say, "They won't be able to get in", I say to you that they can.  There is always a way.<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>And finally I would like to point out that if it for some reason becomes impossible to hijack an airliner, a determined terrorist will find another way.</i><br>
<br>
OK, so does that mean that we shouldn't take measures (simple ones at that) to prevent it?  Do we make airlines "more hijackable" to keep them from going after other targets?  Gimme a break.<br>
<br>
PS- Good thoughts on potential drawbacks though.  That's what I was lookin' for. :) <p>Faust<BR>

I don't think we could ask hijackers to use the special ammo.<br>
