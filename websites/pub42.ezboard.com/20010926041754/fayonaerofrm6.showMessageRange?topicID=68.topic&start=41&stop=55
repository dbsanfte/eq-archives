i dont mind if someone made a fun name for the char they play but i dont like the &quot;ripoff&quot; names from books videogames or whatever like for one the &quot;terratheesper&quot; a icky druid and the name is from final fantasy, sure i dont think its very funny to find &quot;venerial d'seas&quot; in lake of ill omen or &quot;ganjaman puffpuff&quot; zame zone.. i personally DO petition names such as these since i feel its my damn responsibility to do so.<br>
if we sit here and whine how much we dislike those names and then dont do anything about it then we are no better ourselfs.<br>
i was the one mentioned earlier as the SK &quot;incontinensia buttoxx&quot; had it changed to &quot;Itera Giovanni&quot; after gotten petitioned by some spanish guy that found it offensive.. the name was from a monty python film and i took it cause the char was supposed to be nothing more then a trade mule so im actually quite glad they petitioned me so i could get a more suiting name for my character, My enchanter &quot;Treistaania equimanthorn&quot; was originally named &quot;lebben malehate&quot; but that was offensive for swedes it seems..(or to men perhaps) anyway i had it changed.<br>
thing is i dont mind them beeing changed since after a while its not all that fun to run around called lebben or incontinensia but who knew i would play those characters at all? so i have to say THANX to those that petitioned me.<br>

I never once saw his name and thought of the car brand.  Yes, I know of the car, extremely exotic, hand-made, very limited production.  I think that's a much greater stretch to see his name as that of a car over how it was intended.  <br>
<br>
As Hubbe mentioned, Mclaren is a Scottish last name.  I find it interesting that you never knew that it was Scottish.  And in case you didn't notice, he's a barbarian and as a race in EQ, they most closely resemble Scottish brothers and sisters.  I don't care what Verant says, they watched Braveheart the night before they designed the barbarian race.  Thus, his name falls perfectly inline with roleplay value.  <br>
<br>
Now, I must ask this...Why do you feel the need to bug a GM and try to get him to change Mclaren's name?  Because you only see his name as a car?  Even after having it explained that it is indeed not just that, and much more widely accepted as a Scottish name inkeeping with the RP aspect of EQ?<br>
<br>
This is to everyone and no one in particular, those whom seem to think every name that doesn't pass muster in perfect order from every angle, and must try to get GMs to change it right away.  Let me tell you GMs are more than busy enough without /petitions because you just have too much time on your hands and like to rock the boat on a fully harmless name with good roleplay value.  And if you feel the need to petition names, by all means, /petition the blantly harmful, overtly sexual, racist, or such names.  <br>
<br>
Generally, I only take exception the the names which blatantly fall into the first 2 types on the naming policy list.  The rest, perhaps something I wouldn't want to have at best or mildly irritating at worst, shouldn't cause people to drop to their knees in horror as their eyes bleed.  In over 2 years of playing, I've only noticed and felt strongly enough about 1 name that I personally /petitioned it.  It wasn't for some silly reason.  It was a truely disgusting name, and I wouldn't doubt that person had 10 people petition his name in 30 minutes time.<br>
<br>
Let us not de-evolve into petty, name /petitioning children please!  If Mclaren had the name Mcnutty Ballz and ran around zones attempting to perform sexual acts on every female (or male, hehe) character he ran into, well...yah, then you'd have a reason to try and get it changed.  But he doesn't have that kinda offensive name, and infact, it isn't even offensive unless you are really looking for some reason to try causing problems, or you only have wet dreams about McLaren cars and his name ruins that fantasy.  =P<br>
<br>
He's a real nice, generous, helpful person.  I'm proud to think of him as a good friend.  He's worked hard on his character over this course of time.  Like anyone else who has taken a character to 50+, you tend to get attached to your characters.  Names are an extremely large part of that identity.  Only people that are happy about getting their name changed are those people who picked a really stupid name, leveled up, and realized the falacy in their name choice.  For everyone else, it totally screws them up.  <br>
<br>
Have some common decency people.  Especially when talking about mid-high level characters, chances are they've become attached to that name.  Unless it's a real nasty name, live and let live.  If it bothers you, don't look at them, don't group with them, put them on /ignore list and bam.  That should clear up much of the problems their name causes for you.<br>
<br>
And to those that say they hate rip-off names, stop and think about it.  Sure, the names that are very common names that the vast majority know and automatically identify with some movie/book character...that can be obvious rip-offs.  Look hard enough, however, and almost ANY name can be found in some book, movie, TV show, band name, or any other type of media out there.  If not found exactly once you've scoured every possible source (I say every source, because some quote their reason for being offended by naming some truely obscur name that only a very few individuals would even have known, nevermind taken note of and the time to be offended by it), you might very well find some way to argue it reminds you of, or rips off, any of literally millions of names out there in the world.  ...Get real, please.  Don't bother people with harmless names, or else you might find yourself on the recieving end some other time when someone out there finds offense with you!  /points  It's a game, go play, enjoy, talk to friends, whatever works for you.<br>
<br>
Sorry for my excessivly long, and probably confusing, anti-ranting rant.  =)  Much of it turned into general post, just using Mclaren as an example.  Not only cause he's a good friend of mine, but also it's the LEAST offensive name I've EVER seen people rant about on any thread before! <p>Gestalt, 54 Disciple, CT<BR>Gestheal, 24 Cleric, CT<BR>Raker, 22 Rogue, CT<BR>Serrina 55 Preserver, A Ro, XA</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/urattie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rattie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(8/11/01 2:20:18 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Name Rant...</span><hr size=1> You know....this thing with names, really can drive a person nutty.

I even deliberately did not make it Vedda because that's just too obvious :)<br>

If you want to take a roleplay tact then sure, V'da is as valid a roleplay name as any other invented Tier Da name (most have a bunch of 's in them like Va'taurant'foof'geeb'lol'shaddup)..<br>
