Her popularity here, had secured these two a room, and safety atleast for the moment.<br>
<br>
&quot;A tale you say, well I can certainly weave a tale to entertain.&quot; Casidy smiled warmly at the challenge. It was a challenge wasn't it, she had thought that was the intent behind the message. Bah, how could anyone ever hope to compete at tale weaving save for another bard, this was after all her profession. <br>
<br>
Thinking to humor this traveler, Casidy spoke softly, &quot;But surely you must have many tales to tell yourself with all your recent travels, that a mere bard could hardly hope to compete with.&quot;  <p><br>

This young fool was determined to take my challenge, and expected me to falter.  I took a deep swig of the offered ale, wincing at its bitterness (the taverns in Neriak would never serve such swill), and began.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was not always as I appear now.  Once, hard as it may be to believe, I was a mere human, one of the stinking rabble that infest Freeport.  Among them, I could have been royalty, had I chosen; instead, I learned where my place truly was, in Innoruuk's service.&quot;<br>
<br>
I am always amused by the various hand gestures used when I mention the Father's name.<br>
<br>
&quot;But I see no need to bore you with tales of my childhood.  Most prefer tales of wars, of fierce battles between good and evil.  I, however, know nothing about good and evil, only the Truth, and the Lies.  But again, I digress.<br>
<br>
It was early in my career as a Champion of the Father when I decided that it was time to gaze upon His Holy City.  I therefore met with the elders of the Dismal Rage, our Church, and pleaded with them to allow me to make myself useful.  Within weeks, I received the response; I was to report to the Bridge in Nektulos (easily reached by simply following the road) to meet with a fellow Champion in His Service.<br>
<br>
&quot;This was when I met Val'khan, assistant to the great L'vanon, both of the Church of the Firstborn.  It seems that Val'khan was in need of armor and, as I had been trained as a seamstress in my youth, I was quite adept at putting together ruined pelts to make a kind of tattered armor.  Through Val'khan, I would go on to meet my current Master.<br>
<br>
&quot;With them as my guides, I was led through the Foreign Quarter, where the slaves - mostly humans, such as I once was - and the visitors from Grobb and Oggok - spent their time.  The horrific scent...<br>
<br>
&quot;From there, we visited the Commons, where the bank could be found.  Although I was eyed with disdain by the guards due to the lightness of my skin, they made no motion against me.  We therefore continued on to the Lodge of the Dead, where the Shadowknights and Necromancers trained.  At the gates were a trio of ghouls, blessed creatures of Innoruuk raised to do His service.  It was the first time I had ever seen ghouls, and I stood in amazement and awe as they began racing from their post, no doubt to protect the Lodge from some unwanted visitor.<br>
<br>
&quot;Although most of my memories of the seconds that followed are mercifully brief, when I regained conciousness, Val'khan did look quite embarrassed.&quot;<br>
<br>
I looked around with a smile and drained the last of my drink.  &quot;Keep that in mind, should you visit the beautiful city of Neriak - no matter which god you worship, those not of Teir'dal descent are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  not</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> welcome beyond Neriak's Third Gate.&quot; <p>Innoruuk Guides My Path,
