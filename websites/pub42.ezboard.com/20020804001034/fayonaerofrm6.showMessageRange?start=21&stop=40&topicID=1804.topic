After the fight there was name calling in OOC and some hard feelings, but in the end it was worked out in a civilized manner in tells and Prism gave us half the loot to roll amongst ourselfs.<br>

Be Very Very Very happy you won't ever have to kite Fey for your druid epic :( maybe if people still had to do that they would show some respect for kite aggro.. maybe its just me because im old school, but imho if you have aggro of any kind, mob is yours till you wipe or give up.<br>

Had Agema been engaging the mob instead of kiting I and others would just stay at our xp camps.  As Bada indicated, both guilds had capable forces zone in at roughly the same time, after which it comes down to dps.  It's the kind of fuzzy arrangement you'd like to have an independent referee for, but unfortunately we don't have that sort of thing.<br>

Guildmates of mine who were in zone from the start were surprised that I shared loot given the circumstances of the engagement (insofar as which guild was &quot;first in force&quot;), but like I said, i'd rather make friends than enemies and just enjoy the game.  <br>

Sounds fair... doesn't it ?&quot;<br>
<br>
That's how I read it too.  Doesn't sound very fair to me.  Sounds to me like one guild full out KSed and payed their victum off with half the loot to try and keep it quiet after they realized they screwed up... when what they &quot;should&quot; have done was apologize, not touched a single piece of Agema's loot, and walked away hoping that the incident wouldn't appear on the boards.<br>
<br>
The only reason Agema probably went for this we-got-bent-over deal was because the other guild could have just wrongfully kept &quot;all&quot; of the loot.  Thier hands were tied.  Get &quot;some&quot; loot from the bullies that took our lunch money, or watch as everyone here flames them for complaining about being KSed.  (Yes, I'm sure from reading previous posts here, that Agema would have been full out berated on these boards for bringing these events to light, even though THEY were the victums.  Higher tier guilded loudmouths would go on and on about how they &quot;must&quot; have been wrong like they always do). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/utrayvar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trayvar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Journeyman</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(8/2/02 3:05:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1804.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> &quot; As Bada indicated, both guilds had capable forces zone in at roughly the same time, after which it comes down to dps.&quot;<br>
<br>
NO, it comes down to who engages first at that point.  You admit that BOTH guilds had the force present to kill said turtle at this point.  Just because 2 guilds have the force present doesn't mean they have the right to ignore first to engage and just KS a mob from someone else who has already engaged it.<br>
<br>
The kiting the mob prior to the forces being present might as well not exsist.  It didn't even take place as it can't be considered engaging.  But once BOTH guilds had sufficiant forces, neither having engaged yet, who ever starts pulling it to their camp for the kill HAS ENGAGED.  Or are you saying that ganking pulls off of someone is right?<br>
<br>
If we were all to go by your logic here:  Lets say IvM and EW are both in Kael.  EW engages AoW.  Since IvM had the force in the zone that could do AoW, they could just strole up and try to outdamage EW?  That's exactly what you just said, only the mob was a turtle and the guilds were Agema and Prism.<br>
<br>
Both guilds had the force at the time of the pull.  Agema started in on the turtle first.  Prism interfering in a DPS contest at this point is full on KSing with intent. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/umandari.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mandari</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(8/2/02 3:19:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1804.topic&index=30>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.nc.rr.com/prismites/icon1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> Except that Lodizal wasn't engaged by Agema with sufficient force.

<br>
That is so, so very wrong. Ask a GM if you would like. Any GM will tell you the same, it doesn't matter if you're kiting a mob, off-tanking a mob, or doing whatever to a mob while waiting for people to come. If you do not have the force in the zone to kill the mob, it is not your mob. End of story.<br>
<br>
I suppose you think its the same for sitting at a spawn eh? If a guild has someone (or a few people) sitting at the &quot;uber&quot; mobs spawn point, they have rights to it? /chuckle, some people still seem to think that.<br>
<br>
Learn a thing or two about the high end Game before you tell people they're wrong, when you really have no clue. I know when you're quad kiting spectres in oasis noone touches them, but that really isn't the case in the high end game.<br>

Now, individual opinions may vary when it comes to Lodizal, but Agema and Prism amicably resolved the situation.  You can shout at the wind if you like, but as far as I'm concerned  (and Agema, too) the case is closed. If Shuyung wishes to speak of it, he's welcome to contact me in game.  Cheers,<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> According to a member of my guild who was present from the start, when we engaged Lodizal Agema had perhaps 3 people in the area. This is why he was surprised that I would share loot.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
When Prism's full force arrived in zone, Agema had 3 people in the general vicinity, and it appeared to me that one of them was kiting it in a circle, with no visible attempt to kill by any of the 3.  Agema's full forces who had intent to kill must have arrived just after Prism, because when we engaged with intent to kill, I saw only 1 or 2 of them.  It wasn't until Lodi was already well engaged and down a good amount of health did I see Agema's full force arrive.<br>
<br>
Prism's killing force arrived first, Agema's arrived shortly thereafter.  If a guild has 10 people in zone to kill AoW and has aggro but obviously is delaying the kill until more arrive, and another guild brings their 70 people and engage with intent to kill, is this a KS?  First in force has the right.<br>
<br>
I'm glad this was resolved as well as possible between guilds, unfortunately I don't think it's possible for Lodizal to be killed without someone getting upset. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=103705">

<br>
If this is the case, then &quot;according to Verant's rules&quot; Agema would be the KSing party (attempted).  If those 3 weren't engaged and just watching their friend kite it in circles like you say that is.<br>
<br>
What has been provided so far, before your post here that is, is that a few Agema were at the turtle with it engaged first.  Be it 3 people, be it a full group, it doesn't matter since I could 2 box this turtle with a warrior and cleric alone (and am far from uber... full Thurg quested armor is plenty, and it's a good bet the people from Agema were better equipped).<br>
<br>
If they were just standing around and not engaging, watching a single person kite, then yes, Prism didn't KS if what you say is true.<br>
<br>
&quot;If a guild has 10 people in zone to kill AoW and has aggro but obviously is delaying the kill until more arrive, and another guild brings their 70 people and engage with intent to kill, is this a KS? First in force has the right.&quot;<br>
<br>
First in force correct.  This analogy has nothing to do with my analogy though, since mine stated that &quot;both&quot; guilds had sufficiant force to engage (which is also the case with the turtle debate here, hence the term: analogy).  I'm not arguing the &quot;who has sufficiant force has the right&quot; debate, I already know that both guilds had sufficient force present as provided by both Agema and Prism posters.  A force of 3 (hell a force of 2) is enough for that turtle.<br>
<br>
Now, if Agema was pulling to their force of 3, Prism KSed.  If Agema was running it around in circles with no intention of engaging with 3, Prism didn't KS.  Of course, the number 3 isn't really a solid fact as others have posted they had a group there.  The number of Agema present at the turtle is different based on who is posting it seems.<br>
<br>
But statements such as:<br>
<br>
&quot;As Bada indicated, both guilds had capable forces zone in at roughly the same time, after which it comes down to dps&quot;<br>
<br>
coming from a Prism member, indicates that Agema was in the right.  As they had the force in the zone, admitted by a Prism member, PLUS they had the turtle in tow.  They had the force, admitted by a Prism member, &quot;and&quot; they had aggro.<br>
<br>
There wouldn't be as much confusion if one Prism member wouldn't say they didn't have the force ready when another Prism member says they did have the force ready. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/umandari.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mandari</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(8/2/02 5:20:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1804.topic&index=39>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.nc.rr.com/prismites/icon1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> Yes, I can see the confusion.  Like I said before, it can be quite fuzzy, and we have no independent referee to make on the spot calls.<br>
<br>
I zoned in and, after sowing my group and on the way checked numbers: Prism had 17, and Agema had 7.  Mine was the last group to zone in, and when I did so I saw no one at the portal who was a member of Prism (that is, the other 11 were engaged on Lodi or quite close to it).  I don't know where Agema's folks were; but my guildmates stated that by the time we were well into the engagement they had &quot;3 people in the vicinity.&quot;  More might have been there of course, it's not like we're using satellite photos.  <br>
<br>
I called for our people to engage before I gated based on what my guildmates told me: that Lodi was being kited in circles rather than being engaged.  I wanted to be sure of the situation precisely to avoid a KS, which is why I gated last with my group.  <br>
<br>
Yes, it's conceivable that, by some standard, Agema was trying to KS us, but I certainly don't charge them with it.  If they were operating from a &quot;kiting equals engagement&quot; standpoint, then they were only trying to take what they thought was theirs.  I can understand that, since Prism has been in the same position over the same mob.<br>
<br>
Lodi died, and amidst Agema's /ooc outrage (which, to their credit, they quieted down quickly save for Danaldor), I asked for a rep from their guild.  Bada and I spoke, I shared my full perspective on why we engaged, and then shared loot.  He and Merien thanked me, we bowed, and that was that.<br>
<br>
I have absolutely no desire to KS anyone.  I'm also not so familiar with Lodi that I know what it takes to kill him (though now I'm interested in trying it solo <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  It's fuzzy, there is no referee, but I don't think we were at all in the wrong.<br>
