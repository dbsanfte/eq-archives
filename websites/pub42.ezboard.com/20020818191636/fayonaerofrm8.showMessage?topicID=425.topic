I'm trying to plan a VOX raid for our guild and have the following plan...mind you we've never pulled anything like this off... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
So I have about 12 members in mind. The groups are as follows...<br>
<br>
Group 1:<br>
Warrior - 52 - Main Tank<br>
Warrior - 52 - Secondary Tank?<br>
Ranger - 50<br>
Cleric - 52<br>
Monk - 47<br>
Necro - 50<br>
<br>
Group 2:<br>
Warrior - 50 - Secondary Tank?<br>
Ranger - 52<br>
Warrior - 50<br>
Cleric - 52<br>
Mage - 51 - No Epic pet<br>
Rogue - 49<br>
<br>
Group 3:<br>
Enchanter - 50<br>
Enchanter - 50<br>
Enchanter - 50<br>
<br>
I have the chanters in Group 3, for Mana Sieveing.<br>
<br>
Resist Gear would be 100 MR and 100 CR or as close as the kids could get to it.<br>
<br>
My question is can we pull this off with this amount of people.  What and where could we go to do a &quot;trial&quot; run for something like this? Anything else I'm not seeing here?<br>
<br>
Any help and guidance is appreciated.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

I'd also recommend that you take 'recommended minimum' three enchanters; we don't have many hits and can die pretty quickly, so you want that mana GONE fast.  Last week's Vox raid was actually the first time I had seen her die without getting a *single* CH off!  Make sure that all of your folks have the apropriate resist gear (you don't want your troops running around and falling into pits, or your casters dropping so fast they can't contribute to the fight), that you understand the buffing sequence (3-5 'junk' buffs must be laid down prior to putting the 'real' buffs on for the fight), and that you get the best Cleric, Shaman, CR and MR buffs you have available to you and that these go on LAST.  Make sure your casters understand that they MUST be within melee range (the closer the better, her MR is highly dependent on distance) to be able to cast on her.  Melees *need* to carry a shield, and keep her bashed; you *don't* want her flailing all around that huge room.<br>
<br>
Other than that, make sure that your buffing, etc, doesn't take so long that you get giant backspawn, and that everyone knows the way in (don't lose folks falling into the pits, this always sucks).  Oh, and tell your troops to put 'Walk' on before they charge into her, so that if they do get feared, they don't get themselves lost, fall in a pit, or worse, train the raiding party...<br>

Best of luck,<br>

You really do not want to try this, especially on your first try, with less that 24 people; 30 would be better.  As the 'hosting' guild, you would be able to set loot rules, etc, and by pulling in another small guild you might be able to make some connections that might enable to expand your pool of available forces for future endeavors.  As far as small guilds with folks in this level range go, there are lots of us around; contact a few and see who might be game...<br>

We used more of a triage healer line on the outside to keep them alive and well, although it can be quite risky. Heres the overal battle plan(this isn't one guild, so we used public channels unfortunetly):<br>
<br>
First and foremost, we always had everyone who could bind themselves, bind outside in the hall where they are safe. (yea I know vox has come out of her lair, but thats a bug and GMs will usually help u w/ that) We also always buffed up in a buff line for this raid, and I personally like it, just eased my mind in a sense that everyone got the buffs they need in the right order, will take an extra 30 minutes, but if u have the time, I like it. The ppl camp out after the last buff to a designated private chat.<br>
<br>
We would show the healers the designated triage spot, which is where they stand in a half circle where the melees can come in and grab a quick heal then run back in. For naggy, its at the bottom of the ramp under the mouth, for vox its right outside the rock. That included clerics, shamans, and druids. However, if we had sufficient healing force in just the previous two, all 50-52 druids were used as nukers.<br>
<br>
We camped back in after we had gone over the strategy in the chat room to make sure it was down to the T. The raid leader would shout the Charge, and the healers and 1st wave melees would run in (healers would run in to the triage location for vox, for naggy they could stand int he triage spot w/o getting agro). <br>
<br>
The first wave consisted of warriors, paladins, bards (to sing to their tanks) and shadowknights(optional, but doesn't hurt to put em in 1st wave). They would get the first agro and get the dragons to about 90% over the course of 10 seconds.  The job of these melees was to hit taunt and get as much agro as they could possibly manage until the dragon hit them. At which point, they'd turn off auto attack, and then if above 60% hp, start up again, or if 50% or below, make sure they've lost agro, then run to the triage line and shout " SoandSo coming in for a heal". When they get there, they would say the next one, "SoandSo ready to be healed" so that the clerics/shammys wouldn't keep trying but they are too far away. When they get there, the healers would have a similar hot button where they'd have the person targeted, "Healing %T" After being healed, they'd run back in. Also, it was always important to surround the dragon and push them into the middle of the lair For naggy this is the middle of his arena area, and vox it is the little area of raised snow. If naggy gets on the bridge or vox at the rocks, it can mean healers getting hit and interrupted.<br>
<br>
The 2nd wave is called in over shout, which includes the rangers, monks, and rogues. From here, its usually about 25 seconds til naggy/vox hit about 60%. Their primary job is to do melee damage fast, and hope that the agro has stayed on the primary dmg absorbers.<br>
<br>
At 60% or so, we'd usually call in all nukers to lay waste. They'd run in, and and throw down the best nukes they have,w hile staying under the dragon's belly, as their resists are greatly dependant upon how close to them you are. Mages should try to get malosi to stick, and enchanters should debuff. If its vox, chanters should mana sieve until they can't press that spell button anymore. CH's can be very deadly if its a close fight. If u land either malosi or a slow, most likely u'll be killed. But u should have bound there, at which point u'll mem ur primary spell(nuke, or if chanter mana sieve), and run back in. U'll die faster w/o buffs, but it can still mean an extra 2k dmg per person who does that. 4 nukers doing that means an extra 1/4 of the dragons life. The same thing applys to a healer. If u hit the bottom, its much faster to run to the dragons feet and sit and get killed than to attempt to med up, much much. Respawn and mem ur heal then get back to triage line. <br>
<br>
Next we all swing our swords and watch as a dragon falls before our feet, never again to breathe life on norrath, well, until 7-9 days passes or another patch.<br>
<br>
As for groups, u can do it w/ few ppl, but we always had a multitude, lol. However, we pretty much never failed. If u got like 7 groups, heres how I'd suggest em, although u don't, but just hypothetically. And since we don't have self dependant groups b/c we do buffline and triage, they'll be a bit different.<br>
<br>
This is assuming you have 3 bards, 6 warriors, about 15 other melees or so, 6 clerics, about 8 other healers, 7 nukers, and 3 chanters. Yea, its a big raid, but u won't fail ;-)<br>
<br>
Group 1~ Warrior, Warrior, Bard, Melee, Druid/Shaman, Cleric<br>
Group 2~ Warrior, Warrior, Bard, Melee, Druid/Shaman, Cleric<br>
Group 3~ Warrior, Warrior, Bard, Melee, Druid/Shaman, Cleric<br>
Group 4~ Melee, Melee, Melee, Melee, Druid/Shaman, Cleric<br>
<br>
These 4 groups will most likely be your paladins, sks, warriors and bards that will do the first charge.<br>
The Above melees are paly/sk<br>
The Below melees are ranger/rogue/monk<br>
<br>
Group 5~ Melee, Melee, Enchanter, Enchanter, Druid/Shaman, Cleric<br>
Group 6~ Melee, Melee, Melee, Enchanter, Druid/Shaman, Cleric<br>
Group 7~ Melee, Nuker, Druid/Shaman, Druid/Shaman, Nuker, Nuker<br>
Group 8~ Melee, Nuker, Nuker, Nuker, Nuker, Druid/Shaman<br>
<br>
K, those 8 groups are alot of ppl, 48, but if u could ever get that many, thats how I"d recommend grouping them. Feel free to comment on any changes u can think of, this is just my opinion and how I"ve seen it done. And believe u me, it does indeed work.<br>
<br>
Does this seem long to anyone else too? I probably  messed something up in here somewhere, oh well. GL!<br>
