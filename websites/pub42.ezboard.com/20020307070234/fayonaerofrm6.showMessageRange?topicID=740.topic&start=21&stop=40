<br>
I know Haloface since a long time.<br>
He has been a Joker for a longer time.<br>
We fight side by side every other week at least.<br>
I can assure you that Haloface is by far one of the best enchanters I have ever met. <br>
He knows how to play his class and he kicks ass. Nuff said.<br>
<br>
Oh and yes, I know more then one chanter...<br>
And... Please don't come with stuff like &quot;You suck too Taino blabla so everyone that can mezz a mob impresses you&quot; or something. I CAN between judge good and bad players.<br>
<br>
<br>
Generally speaking. Trying to insult Halo, or anyone because of their lvl, gear, skill, guild is seriously weak. Its.. wel.. just weak. <br>
You must have kinda run out of arguments as you wrote this, in a sheer moment of desperance and not knowing how to insult or conter Halo... I can't explain your statement in a different way.<br>
<br>
I tend to disagree with Halo often. Yes, GASP, Halo and I are close friends and I love his nipples. Still I can and do disagree with him and many of his opinions posted on this board (even if you may think I dont, because we BOTH usually disagree with you, too). Just as a hint. People can disagree in politics and opinions and still respect and like eachother. /panic<br>
<br>
&quot;So your stuck here with us Americans that you despise&quot;<br>
<br>
Which means what?<br>
I do not know what you could mean with that. Do we as euros have less rights now? Are we &quot;strangers&quot; or &quot;invaders&quot; now? Are we worth less or something? I don't get it.<br>
<br>
&quot;You should have left with most of the other euros to A-Bay. Becuase all the guilds left here are 95% american &quot;<br>
<br>
I can assure you that I personally know at least 50-100 people from Europe on this server. <br>
My guild has 50% euros too. I know at least 3 big guilds that JUST are euros. <br>
But besides all that... whats your point about it?<br>
<br>

<br>
halo is good... that does not mean skilled or uber it means he is good overall he is great at chanter work and he is also a very good company and a very friendly person to talk to.<br>

and about heated comments about americans, well LL has said so many idiotic things about europe that he should plug it.<br>

Me naughty for saying not nice things =(<br>

Like I said.. I have no idea what Halo is like as a enchanter.. never played with him..  <br>
<br>
just wanted to get a rise out of him.   <br>
<br>
... and wasnt suprised to see the Swedish Calvary ride out to defend him.   <br>
<br>
I not sure how you judge skill in Seb.   East Wing to Drussella is a true test of chanter skills if ya ask me... but ya didnt.. <br>
<br>
Now................. why is it okay for Halo to flame ToV but mean of me to turn up the heat a bit?<br>
<br>
As far as my Epic?  well... nope dont have it.     Would like it... yes..  Phin dead 25+ times.. no goddamn staff..  and I just got sick and tired of going to Kedge Keep.. so I stopped..  If I worked on it I could prolly get it MQ'd..  but Im to lazy and saving up for a horse.<br>
<br>
umm  Triestaania@bondage.com..  I really dont think you and I are doing the same things..  I hope not anyway..  thanks for taking time away from your Champagne Enema to jump in the conversation though.<br>
Oh...   you were talking about TARGET wise..  hmmm..     no..  we arent doing the same thing there either..<br>
<br>
Taino:  You suck too Taino blabla so everyone that can mezz a mob impresses you&quot; .  Sorry,, couldnt resist.<br>
Yeah..  I agree the flames were weak..   most flames are.    Some are funny though.  So. My last ones against Halo werent..   everyone has an off night.  <br>

You flamed ToV as well, didn't you?  Well, not in that specific thread, but, I'm fairly sure you have before.  Additionally, what does his flaming ToV have to do with you, his skill or his gear?<br>
<br>
The simple fact is that you were trolling.  Yes, you may offend the poster in question, however, it's not going to paint you in the best light.  If you're going to call someone else a 'Board Jackass', I suggest you first realise that trolling isn't much appreciated on these boards.

Exactly.<br>
So instead of flaming him for his opinions or behaviour, you made up lies about his person and flamed him for those. Very lame <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Flaming is ok. And so is turning up the heat. This is a NAG section. But don't get so fucking supprised if people NAG back at you when you behave like a jackass. Free speach is NOT the right to bitch without getting bitched back at. It may be the freedom to behave like a jackass, but it is most definitly not the freedom to behave like a jackass without losing reputation over it.<br>
<br>
I want you to stop making a fool of yourself, because I like you and because you wear my guildtag. If you had been a stranger in a strange guild, then I would just have laughed at your behaviour.<br>
<br>
You did three things that people generally dissaprove of:<br>
<br>
*Attacking the person instead of his behavior or opinions.<br>
<br>
*Making up lies about your opponent. And I assure you, if it hadn't been so obvious that you was just flaming, if people had gotten the impression that you did a serious attempt to spread disinformation, then the reactions would have been much harsher.<br>
<br>
*Abusing your membership in a uberguild for leverage. Flaming people for not being uber sucks enough when it comes from uber wannabees, it's worse when it comes from people who actually *do* server firsts and such.<br>

Lleauaric..congrats on your offer for a handshake..its a start. <br>
<br>
<br>
All things aside, I can seperate board discussions from in game play. I am sure Halo is probably a great chanter. Hope to some day to possible group with him, I wouldn't mind FD'ing a few mobs on him..JK. I disputed Taino here and there and then I finally got to group with him a couple days ago and he had me laughing pretty hard..hes damn funny but that doesn't mean I am not going to agree/disagree on some subjects with him. Its kinda like when you work with a complete Ahole...then work is out you walk across the street and you have a few beers with them, and all things are temporarily forgotten. Happy holidays.<br>

True, LL made a complete fool out of himself, and true, his 'I was bored at work' really meant 'uh oh.. what have I done. Ok, gotta dig myself out of this one'. - Yes, even you can make a shitty move LL. Like you said.<br>
But true, I'm not LL. So I don't care. Let's all just loosen up, stop trolling, stop harassing personal game play and character, and keep debating against opinion and moral view points in the threads they belong too.<br>
If LL and Co. can do that, then I will make all the more effort to go a bit easy on my anti-american view points.<br>

Yes, keeping to tells would have been better in some ways. But I couldn't stay out of it. You and I are not the only people directly involved that I care about, and I have many friends who are indirectly involved by sharing our guildtag. I felt the need to point out that your recent behaviour isn't how you are normally, and that it's definitly not the way of Eternal Wrath. I remember one of our leaders temporarily disguilding and quitting the game because she felt a few of us was giving the guild a bad name on this board, and sometimes I'm perhaps overly paranoid that something like that would happen again. So many people hate &quot;ubers&quot; allready, we really don't need to give them real reasons.<br>
<br>
Yet, I'm sorry for being so harsh. It was not my meaning to hurt you. But please understand that it was your current behaviour I was flaming, not you as a person. Yes, indeed I too have my share of screwups. And sometimes friends have strongly disagreed with me about things I still think I was right about. Sometimes when they really felt it was needed they expressed their disaproval openly, and I did not blame them.<br>
<br>

Haloface, who flames others, is crying here in hopes of the peanut gallery's support. What a fucking pussy. How come Haloface can post his opinions on everyone and everything but soon as someone like LL sets their sights on Haloface hes picking on him? Just another case of the gang mentality around here... break away from the teat and post with some confidance.<br>

He's the kind of poster that has an opinion about everything, tells it to you, regardless of if you asked for it or not, then blasts you for being unskilled.<br>
<br>
It's just his M.O.<br>

I know he's flamed me lots of times and I have nothing against him.<br>
<br>
It's the nature of the message board.<br>
