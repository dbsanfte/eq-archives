I'm generally kind enough to heal someone after I give them a res (especially since I don't have that added 600 mana cost for the spell).

At least I have never gotten an amount of money from a cleric for the downtime of 10-15 minutes we all had for that rezz he made. <br><br>There are two, and only two reasons why I do donate for rezzes and TPs. <br>1. They did me a favor. I AM happy for that rezz or TP. Without this favor I would have been in troubles sine I lost Exp, would have to travel for 4 hours or whatever.<br>2. I simply do NOT get a rezz or TP WITHOUT paying.<br><br>&lt;---- Edeina. I do not know in what wrold you live in EQ. I just can imagine it is your guild or your reputation and your friends that you never pay for rezzes or TPs. But I honestly DO NOT and NEVER get a TP for free, and I juust get rezzes for free if its nice people like Zuht that simply always decline the money. If I am in a zone and shout for a rezz I either have Zuht there or someone of his kind (which is like 5% of all clerics), or I simply offer 100pp, 150pp, 200pp... and then drag the corpse there, wait 15 minutes and so on.. and then pay 200pp.<br><br>About downtime.<br>I find it NOT ok to charge money for downtime.<br>I do buff strangers, I do hel other people on the way out of somewhere or in, I give advice, I do drag corpses, I do shout for whatever for others... I do SO many things that do cause downtime. Actually even on a normal pick up group day 50% of my time is service to others in any way. So since a TP costs 20pp which takes 5 minutes all in all and since a rezz costs 100pp which makes 10 minutes  downtime maybe, I should charge around 100pp to show someone a camp or the way out right?<br>I would be rich!<br><br>NO, I do not pay downtime. We ALL have downtikme all the time for whatever reason. And if downtime should be paid, then I will ask the split of the money from our local cleric for the rezz he just made to a stranger. <br>I do pay the favor and thats it. And I do pay it since its like normal you pay for those services.<br>As Ullrich said, he never gets money for draggin a corpse. <br>Why is this? I say dragging a corpse, finding it, draggin it to zone and go back to his group lasts at least as long as a rezz. he even has to move his booty. So /ooc offering corpse dragging for 100pp? I doubt it.<br><br>Again, I am used to pay for favors, and as an answer to Iisbliss, I would never ever expect anyone to run through several zones to rezz me. I would be incredible thankful, but I would in no way ever expect anyone to do so, and so far never did so for me. <br>I pay the favor and since I am used to pay cause you don't get anything if you don't pay.<br>But what bugs me if that clerics and TPers get money for &quot;downtime&quot; and I don't get money for my downtime. <br>I spent many kpp so far in rezzes and TPs.<br>But I have no way to get money myself. <br>I would be more than happy to offer my help or whatever several evenings a week if I could gain money out of it. <br><br>With clerics its kinda special. Their spells cost like mad and their Peridots costs like 11-12pp the piece and hardly anyone bring those to a raid, so they mostly are broke.<br><br>Still I just have a little problem with this having to offer 100-200-300pp for a rezz, but I am willing to do so since I know I am in FP or so and my corpse is laying in Kael or so. So I either pay this money, or my evening is wasted till I am there.<br><br>Lately I got rezzed by a clickstick in Wakenings, after being umm.. welcomed by Woushi. Was a LONG CR and my corpse got even lost and stuff. Suddenly I get rezzed by someone. As I was there I was alone. Noone around.<br>I still have no clue who rezzed me, but due to this I am sure it was a clickstick. <br>Even if I was in a crappy situation with Woushi up, in WL between this nice dragon and Kos Giants with Rezz effect and no idea where I really was, I found it really cool that a cleric like came across my body and actually did take those 2 secs to click his stick on my body.
