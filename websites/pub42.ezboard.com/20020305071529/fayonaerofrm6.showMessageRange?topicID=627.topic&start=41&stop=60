<br>
Well first off, there is nothing liberal about my opposition to the death penalty.  As far as I'm concerned, the relatively peaceful death (by peaceful I mean you are given ample time to prepare for it, come to terms with it, say goodbye to your loved ones, find Jesus if that's your thing) is hardly compensation for suddenly and brutally ripping away the life of another human being without warning or reason.  If the death penalty was truly equal compensation, it would mean having the offender left free and stalking them, only to kill them as brutally as they killed without warning.  Obviously, that's neither practiacal nor safe for the general public.<br>
<br>
As I stated before, criminals need to be kept in prisons of punishment, not luxury.  My idealist vision would be making them all sleep in the same room with trap door long underwear and 24 hours of Barry Manilow piped in.  And they get just that room - no tv, no computers, no personal belongings, nothing not required for basic survival.  Let them receive mail by letter only, and have it read to them by someone else.  And, let the penalty for any prison employee caught smuggling contraband into the prison be a bed of their own in the room instead of a slap on the wrist and a transfer.<br>
<br>
As for your attempt to bring the Taliban into this.  Think about what you are saying.  You want to punish people who believe that the greatest achievement one can reach in life is to die as a martyr to their sick, twisted cause, after which they will go to &quot;heaven&quot; where they will spend eterinity filled with priveledge and honor, by killing them.  How is killing someone who thinks that way a fitting punishment?  It's more like a reward.  If you want to punish them, send them to a prison with female guards, assign them to a female case worker, and put them in a situation where they are powerless.  The cruellest thing you can do to them is sentance them to a life of mediocrity and obscurity.  The hardest part of imprisoning these fools will be keeping the other inmates from killing them ala Jeffery Dahmer.  <p><img src=http://www.kaseyspace.com/EQ/nenasig.jpg align=center>

<br>
I tell you females that have been raped and abused for 30 years and have killed their husband after that HAVE been killed by Death Penalty. It is not what happens every day, but it DOES happen and this is why it is WRONG!<br>
<br>
When 85 people have been released after DNA analysis which have prooven their innocence, do you even think about how many people have died before the DNA Analysis, because some 12 guys thought it would be ok to kill that person because the lawyer talked pretty well?<br>
This is why its wrong!<br>
<br>
And you talk about criminals, Febreeza.<br>
Who is criminal and who isnt?<br>
My brother drove a car being drunk once, then they took his drivers license, 2 weeks later they caught him driving again because he had an emergency and tried to get to his wife. <br>
He was put in PRISON for that.<br>
Legally he is a CRIMINAL now!<br>
<br>
Do you tell me that my brother now has no right to have a life in order anymore? That he is a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> CRIMINAL</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> as you state it? That he did not deserve the possibility to at leats make something out of his (goddamn incredible) 120 days they put him in jail by reading book and learning or at least watch TV?<br>
<br>
THe generalisation is the problem, together with the 'judgement'.<br>
SOme poeple deserve death, some people deserve being called Criminals and not have any worthy life anymore.<br>
But there has not been any possibility yet to proove those things fair. Every case is unique. And I hate it when 12 people judge over life and death of a person, cause the percentage of wrong judgement (caused by good / bad lawyers, prejudices and such) are WAY to high to accept this.<br>

Your about to launch into a Nature/Nurture discussion.  This isnt fair to you because Ill own you sideways on this, and thats not right because the nurture side has some good arguments coming from it, I just dont think your capable of presenting them in a meaningful way.<br>
I majored in Politcal Science with a Minor in Sociology.  I took the job I currently have working in the Prison system. When Im working my overtime stints I spend more time with these prisoners than I do with my own family.  And I can tell you from day in and day out experience that some of these people are just bad, wired wrong.  They enjoy causing human suffering.  I dont know if its from some chemical imbalance or whatever.  But Ive spent time talking to some of the people like this.  Human Predators I think of them as.  A few of them had pretty normal lives, no abuse or any extreme trauma that would equate into Rape or Murder or assault.  <br>
Alot of it stems from a over-developed sense of self worth, these people become so jacked up on false esteem that they are able to casually dismiss the rights and values of others as subservient to their own.  <br>
There are cases where people from the same family, identical twins even, One may be a super guy, the other a complete scumbag.  same up bringing, same backgroup, same life experiences.<br>
Human predators exist Halo, they are out there and everyday they prove it. <p>Lleauaric Fyrewynd<br>Sorcerer<br>Knight of Eternal Wrath<br>Ayonae Ro<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3749">Gear</a>

She had 30 years of opportunity to leave him or press charges against him.  Instead, she decided to stay, and she ALSO decided to kill him.  Her choice to take the abuse, her choice to kill him.  It doesnt mean what happened to her was right, but the fact that she was wronged does not give her the right to pass judgement on her husband and kill him.  That makes her guilty of murder. <br>
<br>
Halo, having worked in a pscyh hospital for almost 2 years, I have come into contact with just about every psychological disease out there.  And I can tell you that some people DO commit crimes without purpose.  I dont say without reason.  The &quot;reason&quot; they do these things is because of a chemical imbalance in the brain, but they dont do it because of something that happened to them.  <br>
<br>
Also, I can tell you that being sexually abused as a child is NO REASON to sexually abuse another child when you are an adult.  Now, I have seen children who have been sexually abused and they will often act out their confusion through inappropriate sexual contact with others.  That I understand.  The child is confused and cannot make sense of what has happened to them.  But when an ADULT sexually abuses a child, and then uses the excuse of having been sexually abused as a child themselves, that is utter bullshit.  As an adult you understand what you are doing is wrong.  You have the option of speaking with someone about your issues.  As above, having been wronged does not give you the right to wrong others.<br>
<br>
Halo, you said we need to make a place where everyone isnt a victim.  I agree.  I think we need to realize that when someone hurts another person, the person being HURT is the victim, not the person doing the hurting.  I dont care if you were slapped around a lot as a child, or if you were picked on in school, or if you had pimples and were shunned for being ugly.  Those are NOT reasons to hurt other people!  You are an adult, you are fucking expected to treat others as they deserve to be treated.  This means if you start having feelings of aggression that you cant handle, get some help!  Once you start hurting others for the hurts you have been given, you cease to be the victim and become the victimizer.<br>
<br>
Justice is the administration of the law, revenge is taking vengeance for injuries or wrongs.  A person has the right to justice, but not revenge.  Meaning:  if you have been harmed, you are within your rights to seek reparations through the law, but NOT by acting on your own.<br>
<br>
To sum up... having been hurt in the past is not an excuse to hurt others in the present.  If you chose to hurt another person, that is your choice; but you had better be willing to accept the consequences.<br>

<br>
I don't like to throw out credintials to make everyone here think I know more then you, or that my opinions are more valid than yours, but I will this time so that you can see where I am coming from (not to say I am better than anyone.)  I have degrees in Criminology and Psychology, and my mother did her clinicals at the hospital Stymp mentions in his post, I think.  (No he and I have never met, or even talked outside of the msg boards).  As stated above, I am not trying to set myself up as better than anyone because I have studied so much in Crimnal Psych (I am actually working as an engineer and not in the field - too heart breaking for me.)<br>
<br>
However, I do agree that there are certain crimes that you can commit that are dire enough to loose your life, and I agree with Stymp that using the excuse of &quot;I am a victim so it wasn't my fault&quot; excuse is for the weak and cowardly.<br>
<br>
I now live in TX, and as all know we have a revolving door on the death chamber down in Huntsville.  I have no problem with the way we do things here.<br>
<br>
For the person that said we are playing God, I disagree.  We are judging the persons actions here on Earth and for those that we deem need it, we sent them to meet God for their final judgement.  Only God can judge the soul and punish it.  We can, however, prevent that soul from continuing down its present path.  (DAMMIT - You have me soundling like a preacher and I hate that!!!)<br>
<br>
Just my 2cp worth.<br>
<br>
PS Since I have yet to kill anyone, I am allowed to excercise my right to speak.  I also agree with who ever said, that when you are convicted of a capital crime, you loose all rights pertaining to life, liberty and pursuuit of hapiness (although I do feel that no one looses the right to due process)<br>

Did he murder his wife, keep her in a freezer for a month, then cut her into pieces and chop her up in a woodchipper (this was done by an airline pilot to his stewardess wife in the eastern US)?  Did he cut his wife into little bitty pieces while she was Unconscious (not dead mind you, just unconscious, until he got to her vital organs), put all the pieces in trash bags, and leave her in a field for someone to find?  (This was done to a girl I went to school with cause her husband didnt like that she was divorcing his abusive ass, and he had been raised that women were chattel, so it was alright for him to do this to her.)  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NO!!!!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> your brother did none of these things.  These are things that are considered in the USA as heinous enough to deserve the death penalty.<br>
<br>
Or maybe he killed his wife, sons, daughters, mother, father, sister and brother.  Or maybe he went across the country raping, mutilating, and killing young children or young women.  These are MASS MURDERS, and SERIAL KILLINGS.  These are things that are considered in the USA as deserving of the death penalty.<br>
<br>
But ONLY after this person is found guilty BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT using ALL that current science can find to prove that this person did it.<br>
<br>
You have every right not to agree with it, but at least learn what it is your talking about before you attempt to use it in an argument.<br>
<br>
Was your brother forced to drive drunk?  No.  Did he know that what he was doing was wrong when he drove the vehicle while his license was suspended?  Yes.  Don't give me some sob story that he couldnt have found some other way to get to his wife.  That would be nothing but an excuse.  If it was that important, he could have found SOMEONE to take him to his wife, without driving his vehicle.  So yes, your brother is a criminal, for the time that he serves his sentence, and hopefully learns a hard lesson from it.  If your brother is old enough to marry, drive, and drink, then he is also old enough to know that his actions have consequences.<br>
<br>
Does he deserve the death penalty?  HELL NO.  And no where in the US that I know of would anyone feel any different.  You are attempting to compare apples and oranges.  When you want to compare Apples and Apples, or Oranges and Oranges then come back with a reasonable argument. <p><HTML><BODY>

/raises hand. That was me. I still cannot agree, however, I do see your point of view. But think of it this way. When we decide to take thier life away, assuming that is what (insert your chosen God here) wants you to do, whether or not they are proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt, are we really any more human than they are? Is it really our right to take them away from Earth to meet their final judgement? Is there any person on this Earth deemed specifically by (insert your chosen God here) to make that call, and send him our unwanted? .......I started to go into an additional speal here, but deleted it because it took a completely new path. That would need a completely new thread. So, I will leave it at that in this post. <br>

I like the idea that someone said about prisons.<br>

For repeat criminals, as mass murderers rapists and so on.<br>
<br>
Just build a HUGE barrack with toilets and small slabs for beds.<br>
Drop food and new prisoners in from the roof by helicopter.<br>
That is under which circumstances they should be allowed to &quot;live&quot;.<br>
If they start to kill each other in jail, so be it.<br>
But putting someone in the chair isnt really a punishment.<br>
Lethal injections arent punishment, it is just a quick solution.<br>
<br>
Let them live, but under incredibly primitive circumstances.<br>

First time offenders in a normal jail with treatment.<br>

<br>
*****Disclaimer: My opinion SOLELY*****<br>
<br>
When the death penalty is put to use, and murderers are in turn murdered, we are doing just that..murdering. However, we are using the excuse that it had been perhaps 'voted on?', judged. We use the excuse that this is human scum that does not deserve to live. Is that not what the murderer thought of those they killed? An eye for an eye in the political system is still just as bad as a father going and knocking the living shit out of the boy who raped his daughter...or the wife murdering the husband who murdered her child. Sure it feels good, right? Hell, if it was me, I would want to do the same thing. Want to, but not do it.  <p><HTML><BODY>

<br>
Murder is &quot;the unlawful killing of a human being by another with malice aforethought, either express or implied.&quot;  Black's Law Dictionary 5th ed.<br>
<br>
Sorry Bri but you are wrong.  In no shape or form is the death penalty &quot;murder.&quot;  Not only is it legal but you lack the mens rea (malice aforethought) to assign to the jury/executioner.  <br>
<br>
The death penalty is simply the highest form of punishment the US society allows.  There have been some creative minds in this thread that think the death penalty is not the highest form of punishment and have come up with some different punishment.  Nevertheless, the general consensus of the US is that the death penalty is an appropriate punishment in limited circumstances (as decided by a cross-section of the US) and that other harsher forms of punishment should not be inflicted.<br>

Noone is right or wrong here. These are opinions. That is my opinion. I in no way believe it to be set in stone. I put my opinion on this board in hopes to see other's points of view on it, and putting forth the challenge for others to change my point of view on things. Challenge my mind! Make me see things from your point of view! Prove your view so well that I feel the need to expand my view. I love to sit here and read this and think to myself &quot;Hey, I see his/her point of view. Never saw it that way...&quot;. It is a great feeling to me to be able to. I have done so quite a few times in this very thread, from different people. And I have gained a new respect for some people on this board by hearing thier opinions, and how strongly they feel about them. If my views were set in stone, life would be very boring.  <p><HTML><BODY>
