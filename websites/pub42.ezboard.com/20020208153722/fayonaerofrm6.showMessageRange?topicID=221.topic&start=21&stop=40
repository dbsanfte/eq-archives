I cannot anyway, I'm not rich. Usually, I just shout in the zone if someone is actually considering TPing to the place I want to go and accept to take me with him. I also sit at Wiz spires (as they seem to accept to TP for free more often than druids in my experience) and ask to everyone who arrives if by chance he's not planning to gate where I want to go myself. It works kind well. There are a lot of nice peoples around. Sometimes, they are friends gathering to raid a dungeon who have one room left in their group, sometimes just a guy who TP his groupmates and is going back to town prior to camp, or they are going to EC to sell/buy ... I often find a kind person who TP me for free. Same for rez. If you ask politely to a cleric who is about to camp for the night, he will most likely do the rez for free. If you bring the corpse to a zone then ask to every people zoning in if he could do a rez in case he's a cleric, he will most likely do it. What I often do is asking a cleric in the zone I died if he can rez me in the next 3 hours. Usually, one or two hours later, he is FM and waiting for a spawn or camping or his group just cleared the spawns around exceptionnaly fast and he can spent a few minutes to rez me and send me a tell.<br>
Well, I am a necro and I always offer to give the mana back (and, when in level range, to assist the group TPer or Rezer is in during a few minutes, to compensate the absence and/or the temporary lost of mana). Believe me or not, very often these nice peoples refuse the mana and the assistance and wish me a good hunt ...<br>
I had to pay to get a TP, but it was a minority of cases. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/usortilegewolfsoul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sortilege Wolfsoul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Regular Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(5/9/01 11:37:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=221.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Always pay for TP and ress?</span><hr size=1> ooops posted before I was finished <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I will say this she is famous now that she has the epic of the &quot;Drive By Res&quot;.  LOL we will zone in someplace and I get &quot;Wait a minute Hun these people all need reses&quot;.  She will click them all.<br>

I will say this though, in the 55+ game most reses are free.  We help each other out in these crazy places we have to crawl in.  Doing a CR for another group that has been wiped is now a common occurance.  You do a good turn and then it will eventually get passed back to you.<br>

Well honestly, if you are going to put it that way, its not worth me dealing with you.  Clerics provide a service that no other class (well, paladins) can, and when it comes down to the fact that you are charging because you are the only one that can make up for that lost exp, it sickens me.<br>
<br>
How much is that lost mana worth to you?  I donate on the principle that a cleric spent time to help me, not because they saved me hours and hours worth of work.  In general, when it comes to rezes, I never even thought of it like that.  Thank you though, for showing me how you can hold your powers over our heads, and taunt us with how valuable they are.<br>

Everyone seems to agree that donating is the right thing to do when it comes to caster mana, but what about manaless services?<br>
<br>
<br>
People don't give donations to Paladins they are not grouped with who use Lay Hands on them. Every time they use that, they have to wait an EQ day [1.5 hours] before it can be used again. Hudge downtime, and if it is being used - it probably saved someone's life. Someone who would otherwise be looking for a rez.<br>
<br>
What about those really cool rogues and monks who drag corpses from groups that they are not even in. If you think about it, those people are putting their character at death risk. As far as I know, they don't get donations for dragging bodies.<br>
<br>
What about that ranger in the zone who you want to babysit tracking for the next 4 or 5 hours to keep an eye out for your uber mob of phat lewtiness? Especially considering that if the ranger does it, you're probably going to benefit financial and he could have easily told his group or someone else to go after it.<br>
<br>
If you yell for help and some people show up to save you, do you donate to your saviours? What if one of them dies? Do you donate to the cleric that is willing to rez that person?<br>

<br>
I agree with it all, except the part about everyone agreeing that casters should be payed. I certainly don't. There is a difference between favors and services, and if you are getting paid then you are performing a service - I am not for hire, thank you very much. <br>
<br>
I don't take money for my mana. Not for summoned items when playing my mage, not for resses when playing my cleric, not for ports when playing a friends druid or necro. I have never asked for payment, and I have rarely accepted it when offered. <br>

<br>
Sorry, what I meant was that it was univerally acceptable to pay for services that use mana regardless of the fact that there are great casters that will never charge anything.<br>
<br>
At the same time, we well accept manaless services from people that cost those individuals time and/or put them in very high resk of dying, yet will not offer anything as payment.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm not saying that I want to be paid - I never would accept payment. Though I have noticed that there are more people who want to donate plat to me for giving them sow then there are people who want to donate plat to me after sitting around bored for hours waiting for their special spawn to show up just so I can track it.<br>

Crydee: Good points. Exactly my idea.<br>
<br>
Shallondra: Thank you very much m'Lady. You saved my day there. I was in FP and our group got wasted by Woushi due to an accidentaly  TP to WL (pesky druids). The Cr was long and tuff. Luckily you saved me many hours and most likely a few more deaths since I am deep kos to everything there.<br>
Thanks a lot /bow<br>

<br>
a friend of mine (Cleric 55) rezzed a Druid at the<br>
entrance of Sebillis. (for free, of course) After<br>
the rezz he ask him for a gate. The druid told him:<br>
sure, 150 pp please.<br>
<br>
I always said any kind of helping should be free.<br>
(everyone play the same game, everyone need each<br>
other) But in this case i would be happy if that<br>
druid have to pay 5k for his next exp res.<br>

<br>
When I do, I never accept donations, whether it be 1pp or 500pp, what do I need with their money? I prefer to go out quad kite me a few giants and earn my money the sweat and blood way...<br>
<br>
If I am busy and porting to a place you need to go, you will never see me refuse. Why be a greedy ass for 5mins when you can certainly get that cash back in 10mins or so.... Beats the hell out of me why a porter would really REALLY need 20-50pp for.... to run a bank? You won't need money to go to one of those.<br>
<br>
However, I do believe donating to clerics is valid. After all they have running costs to continually cast symbols and the such to help OTHER people, I mainly pay a cleric for that reason alone, and will not allow the cleric to refuse my payment. Credit due where credit is deserved. I do not pay for the mana wastage, it isn't like mana is limited now is it? Wizards have regeant cast shield spells, but its to help themself, I don't need anyone to help me buy my stuff to save my ass =P<br>
<br>
Now if you run into a wizard who charges for a port to wherever they are going... you ran into a silly wizard =) Now if I am hunting and you ask for a port, I merely say no, if you are rude to me then I will make a note of it that when I can port you, and you are screaming across the zone, I'll ignore it and will go so far to port someone else in front of you and not you. <br>
<br>
Be polite and everyone will be your friend, and in doing so you won't have to pay for anything anymore.. <br>
<br>
Simple no?<br>
<br>
P.S. - Dammur I barely play anymore =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ujableakl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jableakl</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(5/10/01 4:58:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=221.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Always pay for TP and ress?</span><hr size=1> This was a bad post on my part so just edited all out.
