Besides no where (and I challenge you to find it in ANY post I have placed on this thread) have I called anyone a butcher for being &quot;pro- choice&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Main Entry: geno·cide <br>
Pronunciation: 'je-n&amp;-&quot;sId<br>
Function: noun<br>
Date: 1944<br>
: the deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial, political, or cultural group<br>
<br>
The way I read the statement of &quot;kill em all&quot; was that it condones the systematic destruction of anyone born or in gestational state with the chance of being born with a &quot;defect&quot;.  My friend please tell me WHO defines what is normal and what is defect.  Dont tell me nature.  Personally I find the idea of &quot;normal&quot; to be a much harder term to define than genocide.  Perhaps since you are so intelligent you can define that word for me - since I am obviously weaker minded. <br>
<br>
When I scan back I also see that no where in my comment did I mention 3rd tri-mester abortions.  I didnt even address abortion period in that post.  Again you take issue with statements that I did not say nor did I imply.<br>
<br>
The whole point of my thread was to address the statement &quot;kill em all&quot; - which I still believe was a trolling attempt to piss people off.  When I said &quot;we know what you would do with such a child at or before birth&quot; - I was taking issue with the person making such a statement NOT taking issue with anyone who is pro- choice.  I suggest that you consider scrolling back through the entire thread before making an attack on me or my intelligence.<br>
<br>
While I may be what you term &quot;pro life&quot; and you may be &quot;pro choice&quot; I have not suggested that I think you are wrong because your decision or even what you consider to be your options are not the same as my own.   I would hope that anyone who considers themselves to be &quot;pro-choice&quot; would take offense to a statement like &quot;kill em all&quot;.<br>
<br>
As the mother of a disabled child you can see that I have a vested interest in this topic.  Yes it gets me fucking pissed off when someone says &quot;kill em all&quot; because it suggests to me that this person feels that my son should not have been born.  Perhaps it was not said but to me it was implied.  <br>

Given the realty we have, I think the decission should belong to the woman. <br>
<br>
Very hypothetically, if the fetus could be transfered to the father, then if she wanted a abortion and he didn't, then the fetus should go to him instead of to the trashbin.<br>

As for child support, this thread is wide enough as it is. I'll reply if you start a new thread about it. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

What's important is that the child is given a good start in life, and I most definitly don't think that abortion is some kind of miracle sollution. All it does is to delete the whole package, good and bad together. If possible, I think it's better to fix the fetus then to destroy it. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

It's good that most people on both sides manage to maintain a sane perspective. In heated subjects like this, I guess there will always be a few on each side who goes overboard.<br>

I'm sorry it degenerated to the point of your last post. Again, you're all up in arms over some perceived angst against your position. That angst or anger doesn't exist in me. I'm sorry I somehow led you to believe that. I don't hold anything against you or anyone else that holds your same ideas. I simply don't agree with them.<br>
<br>
I happen to be helping some friends through the decision of whether to abort a probable handicapped child right now, I'm in the medical industry and have been for a long time. They say that's why they're talking to me about it. I felt there was some reason I happened upon the thread at this particular time and hoped to gain some insight through it's discussion.<br>
<br>
I never meant to offend or upset anybody. For that offense and upset, I apologize. The thread did help me appreciate a friend more though so that, I thank you all. I realize it's an anything goes forum, but since the thread was mainly civil, I had hoped it would stay that way. =/ I'll keep my opinions and questions to myself from now on. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=40638>Swysh's Magelo Profile</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucrydeeossiriand.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crydee Ossiriand</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Autosig Tracker</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/10/02 8:14:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1634.topic&index=147>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://questing-ranger.com/images/mboards/archer-2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Controversial subject</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Crydee:<br>

<br>
 My appologies for seeming vague and sledgehammerish, but my point was that not all fetus that you might label as defective will remain so.<br>
<br>
There was a specific case in my family where a baby could have been considered cripped at birth due coming out with one leg completely twisted. Surgery shortly after birth along with years of having to wear special shoes and go through physical therapy eventually corrected this. So yes, not all babies that could be classifed as cripples at the time of their birth will automatically remain so their entire lives.<br>
<br>
<br>
However I now present you with a new question -<br>
<br>
Since it is clearly worth the time and effort to fix one inperfect baby if there is a good chance at completely reversing the defect...<br>
<br>
<br>
Why is it not worth the time and effort to give life to an inperfect baby who's defect cannot be reversed?<br>
<br>
How do you not know that medical technology won't advance enough within that person's lifetime to reverse their birth defect to some extent or at least enough that they will experience no pain, discomfort or undue hardships?<br>
<br>
At what point do you draw the line in deciding where one potential life is worthwhile and another potential should be disgarded without being given a chance?<br>

First of all, let me clarify that I assumed that you would be against the sledgehammer sollution. I simply pointed out that so am I, and why.<br>
<br>

<br>
It's not about how much time and effort it takes, it's about the end result for the child. That's why.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, once the mind have developed in the body (and this process might start before birth, so lets assume it does just to be sure), then it's not a &quot;imperfect baby&quot;, it's a &quot;baby with imperfect body&quot;, if the term imperfect is to be used at all.<br>

The future have not happened yet. For all we know, anything might happen. Maybe we are heading to a utopia where all problems are solved without anguish, and maybe civilization will crumble into a chaos that is a unbearable hell for all who can't fend for themselves - where there's no place for soft computernerds like you and me, much less for people who can't walk. There's no way to know, but I think we shouldn't make any assumptions of heaven or hell. We should base our decissions on what we know and what we find likely, not on our hopes or fears.<br>

Well, first of all - to deserve ANYTHING, you need to exist in the first place. Potential persons don't deserve anything, period. <br>
<br>
In the end, it must be up to the individual mother to decide when, if, and how many times she will give birth to new people. Case by case basis is the only way to go. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

Everybody who has gotten more angry and agitated from reading this thread, raise your hand. <br>

Everybody who has had their mind changed even the least little bit by anything in this thread, raise your hand. (or, for that matter, I'd love to see a show of hands of anybody who has ever changed their mind on this subject in the slightest as the result of a discussion/argument about it). <br>
<br>
You can't argue about this any more than you can argue who's religion is 'right'.  The fundamental axioms (unproven and unprovable) on both sides are different.  People will continue to post those axioms and be quite honestly astonished that everyone doesn't accept them.  <br>
<br>
I've read, listened to and even participated in these discussions for more than 30 years.  The arguments have not changed even a little bit in all that time.  They are not likely to change even a little bit in your lifetimes.  <br>

There are some differences that CAN NOT be resolved. <br>

Just my opinion. <br>

There's a lot of truth to what you say, but I think you are overly pessimistic. People do change their minds, although it's a slow and gradual process. And while it's rare that people &quot;change sides&quot;, we can always learn from each other and add nuance to our own positions. <br>

Aulora and others have given me a lot to think about, and the discussion with Terhas and Swysh had it's interesting parts. I'm sad it freaked out like it did. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

Personally, unless you've seen what a 12 week old fetus looks like or seen readouts of its brainwaves, I don't think you have the intellectual or moral authority to say your opinion is valid.<br>
<br>
If after seeing the physical evidence of life, you wish to remain steadfast in your opinion, then at least you have taken the steps to educate yourself and gather relevent evidence to make an informed decision contrary to your stand.<br>
<br>
As for myself, I've seen the aftermath a woman goes through post abortion. I've seen the occasional agony of the decision, as well as the reckless behavior which resulted in her ultimate decision. And yes time and again it is reckless. Now not all cases are like this, just the ones I had been party to.<br>

Is my opinion right? no, it's an opinion; however, an opinion even it is correct is not worth much when you haven't done the research necessary to arrive at such a conclusion in the first place. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uxyln.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xyln</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/11/02 1:13:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1634.topic&index=152>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Furthermore, once the mind have developed in the body (and this process might start before birth, so lets assume it does just to be sure), <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Kind of confused.Are you saying theres a chance the brain develops after birth? <p>WARNING:Peek-A-Boo can be hazardous to your health</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uedeina.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Edeina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Board Mistress</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/11/02 1:39:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1634.topic&index=153>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.one.se/users/chribesk/edeina.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> Xyln: &quot;Kind of confused.Are you saying theres a chance the brain develops after birth?&quot; <br>

The brain is the hardware, the mind/soul/conciousness is the software. I am not sure exactly when the brain develops capability for higher brain functions, but I do know that that will have to happen before a concious mind can start to develop. Of course, the developments are gradual and interlocked, so I think it's impossible to draw a exact and objective line. <p>Love, Edeina<br>
