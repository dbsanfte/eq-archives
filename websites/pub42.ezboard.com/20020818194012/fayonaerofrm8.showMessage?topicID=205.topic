We get folks together and get into sol b... where we were met by SoT that are ooc'ing to the zone that they will clear the FG's and kill rage.  Although after a long discussion with them they agreed that we were there first and would give us the first shot at the kill.<br>
<br>
We were very happy to hear that from SoT and we began to buff and prepare for the kill.<br>

The hole time Darkwind members were slowly pouring into Sol b and appearing off to the left of Ragefire.<br>

before we know it darkwind is handing in the pearl and killing ragefire...<br>

Please leave comments here on what you think.<br>
<br>
I personally believe that these uber guilds need to stop pushing the less uber guilds around and let us have a chance at the higher end parts of the game for once.  I pay to play just like DW does and I deserve the same chances that they do.  And that goes for every one.  Why push people around in a game if you can't do it in real life.  Be fair.  Don't be lame.<br>
<br>
that is my feelings on the subject.<br>
<br>
sorry Reason... maybe better luck next time?<br>

<br>
as one of Darkwinds Officers/ Leaders i'll response here once<br>
to present our story, can i say story?<br>
also past this post none of Darkwind's members will leave a posting here.<br>
<br>
now up to the topic:<br>
<br>
whoever killed Nagafen isn't supposed to take Ragefire (i don't know who did tho). if he got killed due his drops, to make Ragefire spawn or just to earn a victory for the guild xx doesn't matter at all - he gets killed sooner or later by xx.<br>
<br>
now being Ragefire, a very stupid epic final in my eyes so rare and high demanded, he brings up a few tons of bad attitudes and /ooc /shout wars not for the first time.<br>
<br>
who was/ is first, who spotted him first, who got the forces there first etc.. all this happens, in like seconds, and ends up in a good way or bad way (KS'ing).<br>
<br>
coming up to the time where you got the information..<br>
none knows if you or us got it first (there were like 3/ 4 guilds gathering in seconds). Our info came from Scorpus saying Ragefire is up, provided by Karacho (Mnk) &lt;Matahari&gt; being in his Lair. who owns him now? assumed everyone got the information at the same time, it goes to them who starts FGs first? who take all FGs down first, who has the numbers in Sol B (being prepared to take him without haveing to wait times on reinforcements) or any other reason &lt;enter here&gt;. we i.e. took out the first FGs with 3ppl (some need more some don't - that's no secret) while getting the rest to Sol B. i'm not saying we own him now since we started FGs or get the msg from Scorpus nor Karacho... and got beaten out by ppl of yours and other guilds since they got much random groups there fast just hitting everything moveing. till the time ppl went up to the King there were like 80 ppl in Sol B, called in nearly no time of several guilds.<br>
<br>
there comes the point where none cared about contacting each other to clear the situation up and basicaly everyone just buffed up (50 ppl ? in his lair). some ppl rather spend their time on bitching /ooc /shout and calling the big bad &quot;uber&quot; ppl harsh words instead of focusing on what they came for, Ragefire. now after hitting xx Ragefire camps and several conflicts; some guilds stay calmed and just go for what they came for. short version, we buffed up and handed in the pearl instead of... read on top.<br>
<br>
i do agree that might not be a good day for you and the so strong &quot;uber&quot; attitude comes more than handy but perhaps focusing would have helped more than spending the energy on something else <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
like you would say: maybe better luck next time?<br>
aye, still open tho - depends on your handling to that time.<br>
<br>
that, on a sidenote, everyone was bashing on the Ragefire (without using your pearl) and tried to KS him is realy bad enough to call out some names and warnings. us getting the xp from kill, the clr supposed to loot.. LD (thanks 60 ppl in lair) and the corpse block timer down did not make things easier (since one of your rogues was pretty fast in viewing, at least the corpse, - rogues should be known for that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). he did not take anything at all which would have ended realy bad i assume; there werent given any warnings out.<br>
<br>
that's the day he was - everyone can build up his own mind. this post wont change opinions but at least it's our statement and i don't think that Darkwind is infected of this &quot;bad bad uber&quot; guild thingy (of course only bad things will be posted now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) but the feedback we get over time tells (us as DW) enough.<br>
<br>
thanks for your time, reading.<br>

DW happened to get the forces there before others, congrats darkwind on another cleric epic.  Every cleric is bottlenecked on this one part, and its pretty lame of VI not to change this, but anyway, if you want rage fire, you better be sitting there with 3 groups for how ever many hours it takes for the lamer to spawn.  Otherwise don't complain if someone swoops in and kills him beneath your toes.   That is my humble opinion.  Shouldn't need to bash on it, tho it probally will get bashed upon.  I am agreeing with Calroon on this one.  Even though our guild did back out of it, we didn't have to, darkwind didn't have to, they didn't, they killed, grats to the cleric who now has a water sprinkler.<br>

Sorry to bash Darkwind.. but i was in a very ill mood at the time of the post..<br>

and yes we are all in agreement that VI pretty much created the biggest conflict in the game by making the final battle for the cleric epic so hard to finish.  <br>

Ok put yourself in his shoes Mr. I'm a Dark-Elf-Cleric-Uber-Spokesperson-for-a-Uber-Guild-Man, you aren't in an uber guild and you spend all that time watching out for Ragefire, and he pops then when you find someone nice enough to make a raid for you ASAP, and everyone is buffing up, some uber guild walks in, hands the pearl in and takes your past 120 hours of looking at a red wall and pisses on it, then says, &quot;maybe better luck next time&quot;.  There are over 10 guilds on Ayonae that are &quot;uber&quot;, now next time it might not be you all, but Maybe it'll be Looking Glass, or SoE, or SoT, or EW, or CoDH, or Free Reign, or SC, or AG, or whoever!  Maybe if you took your uber head out your uber ass for a second you could see that you were just in the wrong and that cause you have gone one 'xx' many cleric quest series, doesnt give you a right to steal a camp that someone kept Vigil over for so long cause you, &quot;got your troops there first.&quot;<br>
Total BS and that is why I don't even want to get to that part of my epic quest, cause of asses like you.<br>

I am not saying who is right or wrong but if you want Ragefire nowadays you have to have your whole group to kill him standing around however long it takes in his lair.<br>

This was one of those rare occasions that Zordack spawned WITHOUT anyone camping him.  I am sure of this.  Unfortunately, he spawned at a time when not a lot of Vision members were on so I called upon friends with in Allied Giants, Age of Infamy, and a couple assorted guilds to help in taking him out for my epic.  Unfortunately, a number of things were against us. <br>
1) Communication (mostly my fault), no clear lines were set up between the guilds.<br>
2) We cleared out the fire giants when we should just have let the other guilds help (hehe), well i just gotta kill giants when i see em.  However the end resuslt was that most of us showed up in the lair LOM.<br>
3) Laggg, I was going to turn in the pearl pretty much as soon as I got there and people were ready, however, I was lagging badddd and could not even stand up much less turn in the pearl.  Might have been the result of 70 people in naggys lair, but, maybe not.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I probably would be more pissed if I had been camping rage for 96 hours and then DW came and took him, however, they had the peoples, they turned in their pearl, they got the heart.  Nuff Said.<br>
<br>
Special thanks to Allied Giants, Age of Infamy, and a couple other guilds (cant quite remember their names) for mobilizing to help me with Ragefire.  You ever need help, give me or Cathode a tell and we will make it happen.<br>

Stone spider plus 4 or 5 LDCs couple of lava beeltes and a FG just for good measure. Oh did i mention we didnt have an enchanter?<br>
<br>
damn boring camp if you dont find a way of livening it up. <br>
<br>
Back to the actual topic - it seems noone was camping him since the death of Naggy which to me says ffa. However, had someone been there for 90+ hours like we were i would be very pissed to see an &quot;uber&quot; guild come in and steal as we were buffing up ready. As has been said keep as many people as you can in the LAIR until he spawns be that 10 hours or 100 hours, whatever it takes. No one camping him = ffa in my book.<br>

Verant knows it, Guides/GM's knows it, everyone knows it and it sux since they arent gonna do anything bout it. Its gonna be a dog eat dog world out there and whoever can come up with the force within a short amount of time will always get Ragefire. Does it sound fair? specially to a guy who camped it for few days and got overtaken due to a few mins? Hell No! But can we do anything bout it? Nothing!

<br>
I have been reading all these posts now and was thinking.<br>
If you say you had all your people there and you say DW just came in and took your Ragefire...<br>
Then why in the world when you see all these DW pour in don't you give a tell to one of the members asking who is leading their group. Then you give him/her a tell and kindly ask them to wait 30 minutes to give you and your crew a shot at it because you have been preparing for it. Then I am 100% sure that DW would just sit down on their butts and give you your chance .. and you know what? They might even just have offered u their help since they are there anyway.<br>
<br>
It might be worth a try, and then if DW would have said get lost we uber and gonna take it anyway, then I think you might have a reason to complain.<br>

<br>
You can either be childish when it comes to taking a mob or you can choose to help someone who found rage fire first.<br>
<br>
Either way each person/guild has a choice to make in my opinion and fallout occurs from each choice in terms of reputation.<br>
<br>
Just some support for those of us who are polite and respect others and therefore take the road less travelled.<br>

<br>
Don't really care about the epic business since I don't need to kill him to get it. Just buy it from him.<br>
<br>
Next time he spawns can someone score me the Imbue Fire Opal spell for me? Will pay well.<br>

I have such a spell rotting on one of my alts for some time.<br>

Just send me a tell ingame and it's yours.<br>

Edit: But be careful, I am a member of a bad uber guild (that I won't name here) <p><img src="http://www.camsky.de/scorpus.gif">

The more uber, the more favors too!  Seems like part of the resolution could be planning and communication -- like here in this forum -- but folkses schedules and spontaneity might not allow for that.  Rather it should seem that smaller uber guilds ally themselves with other smaller uber guilds -- LOL -- kinda like the European Union.  <br>
