If you decide to create a pickup group and you find a class that does something you don't like then let them know. <br>
<br>
Communication is generally the key in any good group no matter if it's pickup or a guild raid. I tell people all the time, you're on snares, you're on heals, you're backup healer so easy on the nukes, make sure you load evac, etc. The key is to use tact when you deal with people and not automatically assume since this class blows all their mana or that class doesn't taunt off the healers that they suck and should be removed. Instead let them know their role in the group straight away, let them know what the group is there for, (exp, need before greed, a certain item, etc.). If you take a minute and teach one person &quot;your way&quot; of grinding then they just may learn and make another pickup group very happy. Some people seem to be hopeless cases and have an extreme learning problems or attention spans. If you can get through to these people by sending them a tell saying that this person needs to do his job or be removed from the group then they might get a clue. <br>
<br>
People are too quick to bitch about something without taking the time to teach.<br>
Of course there are many more facets that I haven't covered here and there are extreme cases for everything, but I hope you are mature enough to understand what I'm driving at. <p><p><font color="#008000" face="Arial"><b>Megan Thistletoe</b></font></p>

But without fail it seems that everytime the group get goin someone wants to alter what is going on or wants to pull things that are not part of the plan. Usually resulting in death.<br>
<br>
For example. Have a decent group goin, it is not a stellar group but decent fighting in Sebilis &lt;ugh&gt;. Anyway lets say we are down at D1 in the bug room off to the right, spawn is broken and everyone so far has stated they are just interested in xp and are content with killing what can be handled. The group has the camp under control and are able to take some down time for medding when needed. This is going along great and the xp is doin ok. All of sudden on member or a new member you just got down there starts whining they want to take on more. At first the group says to the person that they are happy with what is goin on and feel that taking on more mobs is just not within the capabilities of the group. Without fail after a while 1 of 2 things happen. <br>
1) They leave the group &lt;YAY&gt;<br>
2) They start pulling extra out of D2 and low and behold the rest of the group was right. It could not be handled, Evac or CR either way it is a pain in the ass. To make things worse then this person starts blaming ppl for not being able to handle it or leaves. If they leave YAY. Either way, now we have to break back down into the room if we decide to go back. Usually the group breaks up and the great time that was happening comes to an end.<br>
<br>
Greedy people are the problem or hyper people. Another situation is you get into the zone and being a bard this has happened a lot to me. A group says man you are the last guy we need and we can move. So join the group and ask what are we goin for? They say Ilis Frog Jail. I say Cool. before we start working down and I find out I am the only one in the group over lvl 55. So I ask, are you sure we can do this? I mean we have no shaman or chanter to slow and we are bit low on level. They start saying how they can do it. I use to head down and give it a try but now I would just disband. <br>
<br>
Hyper person is that guy who is never happy enough with how fast the kills are goin and starts pulling when you already have an assigned puller. I just disband these people any more if I am the leader. <br>
<br>
This happens more times than I care to even think about any more and this is just the easy to see problems. Get some of the people that lurk in seb down there sometime when there is like only 12 people in the zone and watch how the screw things up so badly it is unbelievable. They are so use to the entire zone spawn rate being broken that they are not sure how to deal with a full pop. You can see better evidence of this in Chardok sometime.<br>
<br>
Anyway you can talk to them til you are blue in the face but they just dont seem to listen.<br>
<br>
oh well have fun<br>

<br>
Personally I think everyone goes out of there way to blame somebody else for getting wiped out.  I would be willing to bet 50-60% of people who make rants about dying in pick up groups are probably crappy players as well (present company on this thread excluded of course!).  It is also funny to read some thread about how uber guild 'A' thinks it shit don't stink and that they are so great, only to see that poster later make a thread about how he is so much better then 80% of the Sebilis population.<br>

Isn't it the whole idea of the game to go out and be social and play with the other little critters? Having to interact with strangers is part of the game and is exactly how you make new friends and alliances. People who keep to themselves and their guild are, perhaps enjoying the game in their own way, but as for me I like to group with new people. I hate that a lot of the higher level dungeons are &quot;bring your own group&quot; and all. <br>
<br>
There are, of course, problems. There are the occasional assholes, the &quot;ebays&quot; who don't know what they're doing, the quiet groups in which no one says a word - just working like clockwork like its a 9-5 job, the loot issues, etc. But these things happen. You just learn to adapt and fix whatever problems there are. <br>
<br>
Ah well... I am an adamant pick-up group lover. Wish there were more 50s~ish pick-up group dungeons, besides Karnors...<br>

Not a single word was spoken we all got our exp and items, no loot issues have occured and then like 3 days later when u are bored in god knows where, you get the tell hey man wanna group!<br>

you have to grind exp at times and damn it is boring.. so there has actually been times when we have created situations by purpose to spice the camp up... like pull way to many and see how many can make it out alive and things like that.. another fun thing is to use the AE dots alot when you have a chanter... damn they are fun to see when they run around like crazy to mez them..<br>
the fun part of this is that we generally can handle the situation and there are rarely deaths in our groups but we do have alot of fun and no one knows what to expect and it dont get boring.<br>
we have had several comments like<br>
&quot;you guys do things in a strange way but it works ive gotten 2 yellow bubs in less then 4 hours&quot;<br>
in Lguk its hilarious to pull king to lord and vice versa..<br>
but remember that you are responsible for you actions and dont have fun at some other groups expence, that is do not pull dangerous stunts around others that arent part of the plan.<br>
<br>
Sebilis is the most boring place in eq..<br>
try some other places like HS, explore and try to do a wing with as few as possible, or replace the chanter with a shaman or perhaps a ranger..<br>
all to add some challenge to the game.<br>
this is also why i quit my chanter and made an SK, chanter ALWAYS gets a group and its not a very hard class to play.. everyone takes care of you as a chanter, while they couldnt care less if your an SK.<br>
maybe i play the game for all the wrong reasons but after 2 years this is how i get my kicks..<br>

most fun class ive played so far is shaman.. but never play it as slow/buff only... play it activly and they are hellafun...<br>

<br>
I don't care for pick up, but I will do them if I don't have other alternatives.  The last one I did was in KC a couple nights ago (which is now surprisingly empty) while on my Enchanter.  It started out a bit rocky when we invited two Clerics  One thought we were thinking she couldn't handle the heals.  The rest of the group was thinking this was a good opportunity to allow the Clerics to nuke and/or stun (or swap on this role to give them each a break).  *shrug*  When she left we added a Ranger and just started cleaning up.  It was great.<br>
<br>
The pick up group before that sucked.  People sitting back and putting in minimal effort.  I had to work twice as hard to make up for two shitty Paladins.  Add in people quitting out for no reason and it was not a good experience.  *shrug*<br>
<br>
I prefer guild groups.  If I need to do pick up, I will.  If it sucks, I'll either find something else to do or make the best of it. <p><B><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2 COLOR="#3A6EA5">Jzonn Stormwolf &lt;Final Destiny&gt;</B></FONT><BR>

<br>
Lately I have started enjoy pickupgroups again, but nothing like the old days. It's a lottery really. Some pickup groups are great, and some are so bad I hate myself for ever taking up pickupgrouping again. If I can I include some friends and guildmates in the group. That tends to giv eit a core of reliability and minimize the risk for total fackups. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

i rather hunt with friends though, more fun and talk and it's more safely - you know what you can do with this group and what you can't, and you know how everyone will react in stress situations. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ublizzdatroll.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Blizz Da Troll</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/28/01 4:27:57 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: pickup group pro and con</span><hr size=1> I hate pick up groups with members that have no sense of humor and is out ONLY for exp and loot.

Have any of you ever left a group because an individual was being TOO greedy? Ive left groups in 2 occassions where this happened. This one &quot;person&quot; tells the group &quot;Im not going to d1, nothing drops for me there&quot;, well I was laughing and all but still I left the group right after that person said that. Avoid those types of people for good pickup groups =)<br>
<br>
Also, dont forget to group those pallys, necros, druids,  and rangers... All those rumors you heard about them are LIES! they are the best classes in EQ... so please, dont neglect them.<br>

My favorite thing about pick-up groups is well meeting people.  If I only grouped with current friends/guildies how would I ever get to meet Blizz or Ottor or the 100's of other great people that lurk around Sebilis.  Group with strangers one day and if it goes well the next day they are your friends <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
This also helps when you are uber_blackguard_05 LFG, most groups would take you over someone else they don't know.<br>

Go in Seb, meet some people, get some exp and maybe some items, and than its all said and done in a few hours. Either it is time to log or time for a another opportunity to meet new people etc etc. <br>
<br>
Now it seems I am too busy these days, and I regret it sometimes. Yes, there is the risk of getting a bad group, but I think you are all missing the point.<br>
<br>
Pickup Groups are one of the few ways that we can go past the walls that Guilds tend to build around themselves. They dispell rumors and make those that seem enigmatic more tangible. It can counteract thoughts that EVERYONE from Guild XYZ are a bunch of friggen Aholes. It also allows you to see in advance who might be tomorrow's applicant to your guild. Its a chance to MAKE FRIENDS and also find your ENEMIES. Its a chance to cut lose a bit and its a chance to strut your stuff. Like it or not, its a chance to make some money for ports and to buy everyday sundry items such as food. Its a chance to get minor upgrades that 6 people can handle.<br>
<br>
So don't give up on them yet. They are too important. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/utbok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tbok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/30/01 5:59:12 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://planet-rui.pt-quorum.com/fantasy/dragon47.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /shrug</span><hr size=1> One thing I forgot.
