2) the government cannot divulge that information at this time or it will risk compromising other agents/investigations<br>

<br>
I'm not exactly happy about this myself, and I may be one of the strongest government supporters out there.  However, the designation as an "enemy combatant" is within the bounds of the constitution, and has stood up to the Supreme Court in the past.  I'm pretty sure I'd rather see this happen than an "oops, killed him during capture, shucks".  And obviously we can't let this guy out of custody, he'll be in Somalia 24 hours later plotting his next attack on America.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the fear with letting him talk to his attorney is that the attorney may, even unwittingly, pass messages to other terrorists that are already here.  We've already see that happen...<br>
<br>
All that said, I'm still uneasy about it... not quite outraged, but it does make me raise an eyeball.  We can't violate the constitution to protect it. <p><BR><br><B><I><img src="http://www.druidmail.com/santerre2.gif">Santerre.</I></B></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uledge.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ledge</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/13/02 4:42:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1490.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dirty Bomb Suspect</span><hr size=1> Anyone who says what the US government is doing is right is surrendering their rights and freedoms. <br>

If you support this you are supporting a state in which the government simply has to label you as a &quot;fill in the blank&quot; and you are held indefinately. No contact with friends lawyers or the press.<br>

The US is not at war...no formal declaration was made by congress. This man is not representing a state or foreign country and can not be a prisonor of war.<br>

The term unlawful combantant is a bogus one designed to blindfold the world and allow the governemnt to begin eroding your rights. When before Sept. 11th did you ever hear the tearm unlawful combatant?<br>

YEP! You are right, my bad. Lets let this homeboy dance around the US with dirty bomb and known ties to al qaeda and wait around until he decides to set it off. Yeah, there is a damn good idea. Now look, my wife and children are dead, and in pieces mind you, see there is my wifes head, or whats left of it. Oh, I was furtunate, see I was outside of the blast radious, but since there was enough Plotunium to light up LA for a week or so, my nuts are glowing so brightly I look like Jeff Bridges in &quot;STARMAN&quot;. Since I don't have ties to al qaeda, and I am not a convicted felon, then they would only hold me until the saw that I was indead innocent. I don't have a problem with that, because if I was indeed a terrorist then I wouldn't want me on the street, I would want me in a holding cell, I wouldn't have to worry about me, when I got on a Airplane, or when I went to get on a bus, or a subway, or when I got my gas at a 7-11.<br>

Folks, it's the overall PC attitude anymore. In a world where a man can break into your home to rob you, trip, break his arm, then sue you about it, I'm sure they knew this would stir up a shitstorm.<br>
<br>
Remeber back after the towers? Remember the discussions about how we might have to give in to a little more gov't meddling? This is a fine example. There are times for the exception to the rule and this is one of em. My prediction: you'll see more of this in the future when dealing with terrorists.<br>
<br>
It's real easy to sit back and cry how his rights have been violated. Real easy. And if he did get let out, get off on some loophole or something, then come back and blow up a bunch of folks, how are you going to feel then? <br>
<br>
They guy has ties to em. I'd rather err on the side of caution. After all, if they can't prove anything, he's just going to sue the government over it.<br>

That being said, he should have been monitored closely and followed to see what other agents he would have come in contact with. In the course of his activities he sooner or later would have tried to build a bomb of some sort or done something else that he could be charged with. Once he is caught red handed, he should have been charged with treason. If he was just doing recon, he could still have been nabbed for questioning before he tried to leave the country again.<br>

This &quot;enemy combatant&quot; stuff sounds entirely too shady to me. It might be strictly legal, but I sure as hell don't like the implications. Suppose some guy has a flat tire on the highway and you help him out. The FBI happens to be following the guy and gets lots of pictures of you helping him fix a flat. The next day he is caught trying to bomb a gas station. Lo and behold you are picked up , labeled an enemy combatant because they have pictures of you helping him on the highway and you are locked away with no lawyer, no charges and no recourse for months or even years on end. Far fetched? Yes, but not impossible. That is what I have a problem with. <p>Gulor Gularin

I don't want the government to have unlimited powers to arrest citizens and hold them without charging them indefinitely.  <br>
<br>
But look at the other side of the coin, as a citizen, or as the administration.  What happens if you are watching this guy, you know he's met with Al Queda, you have *circumstantial* evidence that he is planning to set off a dirty bomb... and you lose him... and he blows it off in Times Square on New Year's Eve, irradiating a million people?  If I were Mr. Ashcroft, I'd rather have some folks crying foul about me violating some scumbag's civil rights then have all that blood on my hands.  <br>
<br>
Sometimes life gives you hard choices, and dogmatically following the rules without regard for common sense is not your best option.  If I knew for certain someone was going to go into a kindergarten class and open fire, I'd most certainly kill them first even if it meant I would spend the rest of my life in jail.<br>
<br>
Something else to think about - perhaps he is being kept from communicating with his lawyer because the nuclear material is still at large, and they don't want the lawyer sending info to his cronies on its whereabouts.  Perhaps, once secured, they will be able to release more info and try him as a citizen?  To me, that is justifiable, but we'll have to see it play out. <p><BR><br><B><I><img src="http://www.druidmail.com/santerre2.gif">Santerre.</I></B></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ugulorgularin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gulor Gularin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/13/02 6:58:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1490.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OK</span><hr size=1> Santerre wrote-<br>

I agree that lives are more important than rules. In this case I think it unlikely he would just &quot;slip away&quot; since they were following him all the way from Pakistan. If he did somehow slip his surveillance (it does happen) THEN you put out an all points bulletin to grab him for questioning. If they were so worried about him getting away then he should not have been allowed to board the plane to the US in the first place. By pouncing on him in Chicago, they lost any chance of catching other agents he may have contacted. <p>Gulor Gularin
