I just wanted to clarify a few things, mainly about the new chosen child of hate etc, anyway here's an event which is interesting that happened last week:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
With orders from King Naythox Thex, Dorvias N'Keth (the King's royal advisor) sent a herald to locate and bring back Tsajin K'Layn. She was found lurking within the East Commons tunnel.<br>
<br>
Once she arrived, the King offered her 10% of the Neriak Royal Treasury if she could accomplish one task. King Naythox explained &quot;The Dead have removed an item from Neriak that we desire. An item that deserves to be in the hands of the Priesthood. There is one named Ashteth T'Dral...he is the son of a Prophet, and a young Prophet himself. Queen Cristianos has removed this item, a Tome of Rites, to the depths of Najena. There Ashteth is guarding it. The Priesthood needs this Tome. You need not know why, just that we need it, and that you will be rewarded for its return to Dorvias.&quot; Tsajin called to the small crowd around her and they ran to Najena to retrieve the Tome.<br>
<br>
<br>
Drelzna was found already waiting outside of Najena, yet was no match for the crowd that had gathered. Moments after Drelzna fell, Ashteth appeared. As soon as Tsajin questioned Ashteth about the Tome he slipped it out from his robe and handed it to her, then cryptically said, &quot;You have done well to fulfill your part in history. Take the Tome with my most sincere regards to his Majesty and inform him we will meet in due time. Return quickly lest her Majesty take note of the missing Tome&quot; The crowd hesitated momentarily, wondering if it could have really been that easy, yet Tsajin reminded them there was a reward to be claimed and they all excitedly traveled back to Neriak.<br>
<br>
<br>
Moving into Neriak's Third Gate, the crowd located and gathered around Dorvias, who asked for the Tome. Tsajin, was wary and so refused to give up the book until she spoke to the King himself. She wanted the promised reward! Dorvias led the group to King Naythox who, after assuring Tsajin of his and the Priesthoods appreciation, struck Tsajin down and said &quot;There is a lesson to be learned from her actions.&quot; The crowd stood helpless and appalled until the King brought them from their thoughts by shouting, &quot;My fellow Tier'Dal, listen a moment. A powerful ceremony is to be attempted.&quot; The crowd then followed the King down thru several passages until they came upon a large room.<br>
<br>
 <br>
Across a small moat and up a small hill stood two figures, an Elfin youth and a Dark Offerer, awaiting to be sacrificed. Dorvias pulled the Tome, a Book of Dark Rites, from his bag and swiftly killed the Dark Offerer, then shouted, &quot;Innoruk, the Dark Father, to you we give the blood of an innocent, the child of your enemy and the body of our birth.&quot; Then, just as swiftly, the frightened Koada'Dal died beneath his hands. Dorvias slowly turned around and shouted, &quot;With these children of light and dark, now cradled forever within your hated embrace, accept your gifts and return us to your guidance.&quot;<br>
<br>
 <br>
The very walls of Neriak shuddered as waves of Hate surged thru the city. The Avatar of Hate appeared atop the hill and searched the crowd. Suddenly Ashteth stepped from the group and with a bow, conversed privately with the Avatar for a few brief moments. With a nod, Ashteth turned to address the crowd as the Avatar disappeared. &quot;It would appear,&quot; Ashteth shouted, &quot;that your assumptions concerning &quot;The Child&quot; was indeed correct. A duty has been placed before each of you. Dorvias, Lanys is no longer required. She has become a waste, a mockery of his work. You are to perform another rite, as you have done here today. This power will restore the power lost in the creation of Lanys. The Avatar told me of another...a child. She has been taken by those loyal to Lanys, and placed in a Keep that has been warded against all these that are tainted with the Touch of the Plane of Hate. It has been so strongly warded that Lanys herself cannot safely enter there. This place is Befallen. You must recover the child. This is the will of the Father.&quot; King Naythox had listened intently thru all of this, then turned and said to the group, &quot;My fellow Tier'Dal, we shall soon call upon you again, to bring us all to glory. We will rightfully take what is ours. Prepare yourselves, and your countrymen! You shall hear from us again soon.&quot; With this said, the King and Dorvias turned and were gone.<br>

<br>
<br>
Anyways what I'm thinking is real interesting is that this new child of hate, Zerinae D'Tora, is chained to the wall on the bottom level of Befallen. Why?<br>
Me thinks VERY strongly that this is linked to Mayong.<br>
Mayong wants revenge on Innoruk for cursing him in to his present state, no? What better way to do that than to kill his new chosen child of hate. Thus, Lany's has the best trade for Mayong, in order to get her last piece of the Maleovence, the gem. <br>
However, we know that Lany's has taken over Befallen, BUT, she herself cannot even entred as it is blessed with so much hate &quot;It has been so strongly warded that Lanys herself cannot safely enter there. This place is Befallen&quot;<br>
So, how the hell is she gonna use Zerinae D'Tora to her advantage?<br>
Just some new things to think about.<br>
Also, is it me or is there a real lack of activity on this board lately? More happenings than ever lately and not many ppl seem to be acknowledging them.<br>
