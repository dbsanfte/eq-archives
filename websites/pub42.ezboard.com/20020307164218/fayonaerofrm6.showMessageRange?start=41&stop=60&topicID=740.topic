Good equippment is important both in RL and ingame, but it does not in itself have any connection to skill. A great painter can make neat pictures with crayons, although not as great as with oil, while someone with no skill could not make a great drawing no matter what equippment he uses.<br>

Pretty irritating, not too fond of the mentality directing his oppinions about the &quot;bad Americans&quot; and his tactics at gaining support are obvious. I wouldn't think of Haloface as projecting the mentality I approve of. But...see, I don't like Haloface for his writing and projection of himself. I don't think he's a poor individual because of his &quot;gear&quot; or guild status. <br>
<br>
After reading Lleau's posts on this board for a while, I've found him to be one of those &quot;I hope they think I'm tough when I write this&quot; with little to offer as far as integrity. A weakling will say he &quot;tells it how he sees it&quot;, but there should be no debate as to wether he's an enlightened individual. More obnoxious I'd say. <br>
<br>
Lleauric just displayed a mentality of the &quot;uber&quot; Everquest player that is much like a sickness. Judge value based on &quot;gear&quot;. Verant's items mean everything to them. They are enthralled to Verant much like one of those mutant outcasts in the Deep serve the Overfiend. They see the game as &quot;we did this first !&quot;  or &quot;we get the items, and respect those who have the items !&quot;. It's corrupt, and regardless of someone posting later &quot;hey, we're not all like this&quot; you play side by side with these boneheads. It must be wonderful to be a part of a materialistic virtual world and be on top for once, eh? A subtle form of Role Playing. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm rich ! I'm rich !&quot;  The Everquest Player says while sitting alone in his computer room. <br>
<br>
So, can't say I've liked either of them from what they showed here on this board.  Haloface has made plenty of posts that are in line with the Momento style. A few awkward insulting posts aimed at me as well. Doesn't matter too much, if a Mcdonald's employee said I wasn't &quot;his&quot; kind of peer group member, I'd not weep for too long. <br>
<br>
What's interesting, is how many other level 60 &quot;uber&quot; players (what a rediculous word to embrace and dub yourselves as) feel as Llear does.  When you see that unguilded high level player lfg in Sebilis, do you think to yourself &quot;how pathetic, he'll never see Vulak will he? What a loser. Look at his meager gear, sickening?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Officer, I think you've made a mistake. I don't think we'll be needing to give me a speeding ticket, after all....don't you know who I am? I have a level 60 Everquest character in the guild 'Blood of the Spider'. What do YOU have?&quot;<br>

Just as when my hamburger is made incorrectly, I walk up to the counter and address the employee who took the order. I do indeed rate your content as deserving of a response as a message given by Momento.  Indeed, even Zilor. Were it not for the moral issue brought up by Lleauric's message aimed at your person, I would have looked over the thread as meaningless. You offer nothing. Imagine, seeking advice on how to &quot;twink&quot; a warrior. I frowned on each player who spoke up and advised you on how to outfit a toon to show off. Your projection is worthless. Do I expect many to agree? If I went to a Burger King message board and posted they made horrible French Fries, would I be surprised to find opposition to my oppinion? Should I feign surprise that when I stereo-type the value of an Everquest player, that the very player will post text defending itself? No. Do I expect an addicted, greedy player to diagnose himself as just that, and cry out &quot;I have seen the light, thank you Dreadnok !&quot;? No. I'm not here to join the club. Try to imagine this as the perspective of the an Everquest player who is not really an Everquest player. I never embraced the power gaming aspect, for the same reason I don't join in the pick up game outside the gradeschool at 3:30. I don't relate to those kids. I'm waiting for the adult pick-up game. <br>
<br>
<br>
You assume too much about me. My messages are quite clear. What I don't like, is easily defined. I never once wrote &quot;I hate all Everquest Players&quot;. Instead, I describe in many words (many) which type of player I find displeasing.  Try a different route than your attempt to &quot;gather&quot; followers against your opposition on message board oppinions. Absurd, awkward Everquest player that you are. <br>
<br>
I wouldn't need the suggestion of a player mentality I disapprove of to inform me on wether or not I should cease playing the game. <br>
<br>
I am aware of my audience, and feel the risk of having the greedy &quot;uber&quot; players, or the inspectoin mad fools disliking me being &quot;worth it&quot; to present a message that that form of player doesn't find pleasant to read. Rest assured, there are Everquest players out there who are not ignorant in the sense that this is anything more than a game, and that items and virtual accomplishments arn't too meaningful. A good companion, however is. Our standards of good companions are different. Given. <br>
<br>
Read carefully. I don't like you because of the &quot;you&quot; you post here. I would actually sympathize the reasoning that Lleauric took justifying his attack on you. I just rather shake my head and continue on. The only thing an Everquest player has to dislike me about justly, would be the fact that I don't like greedy, uneducated players, and whores.<br>
<br>
I have honored you with a response. Until your content improves, you'll not find another. <br>
<br>
I detest Mexican Soap Operas. Not because they're Mexican, but because they're Mexican Soap Operas. Haloface is one of the lead actors in this particular (and very bad) Mexican Soap Opera. <br>
<br>
I am very polite. I avoid rudeness and stupidity with ease. And I post long messages in the capital city of the country of Dumb....which is the Ayonae Ro NAG forum. <br>
<br>
Truth is, the people who would like my messages the most, would be observers of Everquest Players, likely not most Everquest players themselves. Perhaps Everquest players who arn't too involved might understand my &quot;labeling&quot;. <br>
<br>
If you're a mature adult, and you're not obsessed with items, you shouldn't take offense to any of my messages. If you don't type &quot;sow plz, wtf hon?&quot; all day, laugh at swear words written in text, don't refer to yourself as &quot;uber&quot; and don't &quot;need&quot; or &quot;beg&quot; for items....you shouldn't mind what I write at all. <br>
<br>
If you take offense to my messages, you likely fall into the catagory of one of my stereo-types and I admire your willingness to defend yourself. Labels are awful, but rest assured in the virtual world of Everquest, I am likely in minority. Because items and &quot;uberness&quot; *shudder* don't mean much to me. If I was in the first guild to kill Luclin, I wouldn't feel proud. If I was in the first guild to enforce personality screening and emphasize honor....filtering out every greedy, self loving juvenile out there...I would feel proud. <br>

<br>
An egotistical Eternal Wrath teenager and an &quot;America's drowning in hypocracy!&quot; freedom fighter. <br>
<br>
I got one to wtf at me. The other used an obvious scam to rally support with an attempt to make my general statement about a certain type of player to include them all, in hopes to gain assertive power through a lacky joining in. Relying on the self esteem boost given earlier to Haloface when friends jumped to his aid supporting his having skills.  Then one tried to make me seem like the &quot;bizarre one&quot; with a reference to an Adam Sandler movie character. I just didn't know how to respond, after all...I'll never see everything he sees in this game.<br>
<br>
&quot;Huh? He hates us all? Why I oughtta....&quot;<br>
Oh..wait....it was a sympathy tactic, easily recognized in text. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well...look...he's captain ...Insano ..posting...all that..stats...on robe...plz...mistell. stfu, I'm goin' quaddin  !&quot;<br>
<br>
Then both used the &quot;What are you.....some sort of...perfect..super unflawed...saint type...guy?&quot; defense. <br>
Not that it's bad, it's a good question. That would be crazy weird if I was.  Your posts are still going to be obnoxious and foolish, and mine will still be long and mocking (or insightful depending on the one I'm responding to)<br>

You know Dread, let US class you for a change.<br>
You seem to hate, with a fiery passion, the entire player base of everquest unless they conform or adapt to your small, narrow minded way of existing.<br>
You know where I see you, moaning and whinning all the damn time, about the same place as those guys that use the abreviations in every sentence, that you despise so much.<br>
Here's a tip: Fuck off if you don't like the game, and just - for the love of god - stop posting every second you encounter a 'nasty sort of fellow'. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

Ive known Dread, as he is known now, for a long time, and your classification seems ignorant. Its true that his expectation for the average Everquest player is rough at best (maybe to rough, but who am I to say that or anyone on this board for that matter?) but everyone can see that he values the gaming experience and not the reward of loot at the end. This is how he chooses to play the game, that is how he chooses to spend his time and you have no right flaming him for it. He never said you should play his way, he just gave his 2cp about you. Its kind of funny how you flame Dread when he puts his views of you when the first post on this thread started by you is your opinion of another EQ player where you got flamed immediatly after. Seems hypocritical to me but I can be wrong.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uflexuregraverobber.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Flexure Graverobber</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/22/01 1:33:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=740.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> &quot;Seems hypocritical to me&quot;<br>

Hmm, read this board lately? =P All posters (including me) change opinions and standings constantly.. you gotta learn which way the windblows today...<br>

And as for flaming him, if you post something long with lots of opinions in a thread like this, what do you expect to happen?

6) Zagio/Corpseus<br>
7) Cantankerous/Tenar<br>

I have known him since the server split, he is the best fucking enchanter i have ever met in my life,  he is a nice person both in game an out.  he always made time for me, or to help me when i needed it, he knows more than you can imagine, and he's seen almsot every zone in the game, and i agree with him, those people in A_Uber_Guild01 have forgotten how to have fun. ( with exeption for CB, they are just cool :-) )<br>
<br>
Haloface is one of the best people i know in EQ, he does have a *unique* look on things.... *cough* Nipples *cough*  but that's just him.<br>
<br>
And if you hasve a problem with him, you got a problem with me as well.<br>

<br>
Have you ever been in one?  Eternal Wrath is one of the top 5 guilds in Everquest...  and I hate to disappoint you.. but we have a great time.  The people in my guild are a great bunch of people who care about each other, make each other laugh on a regular basis... oh and kill mobs.<br>
<br>
Let me burst another bubble.  You want a common denominator for people in Uber-Guilds..  OK..   Id say the majority of people in Eternal Wrath either come from a Military Backgroud or a athletic background.   The guild is successful becuase people know how to work as a team and do the things needed to acheive lofty goals that we set for ourselves.  EW is prolly the purest form of a Democracy that any guild is..  Every member is an officer, we vote on everything.  Respect and Honor for each other is what my guild runs on..  we would fall apart without it.  Each and every member is more than capable and we have alot of the best players on the server.  Hands Down.  Thats in a Raid or a pickup group.   Eternal Wrath is, has been and always will be about Challenges, equality amoung peers, and having a good time..  not loot...<br>
<br>
Time enough to burst another bubble?  Sure..  how about Dreadnoks..<br>
Dreadnok.. Im prolly everything you hate.  I grew up as the son of a very well respected Sgt. in the CT. State Police.  I was popular in High School and had a great circle of friends.   I played Football too.  And I was Damn good at it..   my senior year I was All-State 1st Team Hartford Courant, All-State Offense New Haven Registar, 2nd Team All New England and Honorable Mention All-American at the center position.  I was recruited by Several schools.  University of Virgina, West Point, UConn, Umass, Lehigh, Lafayette.  I decided to attend the University of Rhode Island on a full football scholarship.  I started for 3 and half years. My mother and father came to each and every game, even if I wasnt playing.  Nothing is better when your father and mother gives you that look of pride,  its a great memory.  I also was in the Fraternity Phi Kappa Psi..   Greek Week winners 4 times in a row while I was there.  Partied my ass off, played some football and got a free education.   Went wild for a few years until I met my Wife.   (Married 3 months ago after 4 years of being together).  Beautiful, smart, with a great job as a Pedi ICU nurse at a Major world reknown hospital.  Me?  I work for the State right now.  Im the youngest supervisor in the state in my department, and Im working on finishing my teachers degree to teach history and coach football.<br>
Last nght I didnt log on becuase Me and my wife and my best friend and his wife went to New York, saw Les Mis (awesome!) then went to Mulberry St and had dinner at La Mela.  an Incredible Italian resturant.<br>
Basically, no matter what you do dreadnok..  im doing better than you..  if Im on EQ.. im doing better than you.. If im not.. im doing better than you.  <br>
Please go find a bridge and jump off<br>
