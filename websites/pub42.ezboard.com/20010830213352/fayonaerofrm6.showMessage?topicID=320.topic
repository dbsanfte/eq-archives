Fun Class ... Shadow Knight is an independant class who is capable of surviving in most situations.  Bag of tricks include Lev/Fear/FD/Invis/InvisUndead/Visionspells/ShadowStep/DamageShield/DOT's/DD's/PET<br>
<br>
Definately caster independant and fun to play since this class has very few weaknesses.<br>

<br>
Having played a cleric for well over two years...I still play a cleric more than any other class.<br>
<br>
Boring? Naw... not all the time... during raids, yes...but thankfully I am an avid reader <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
But, other than raids, I still have fun with my cleric.<br>
<br>
I think, so far, out of all the classes I have/do play (SK, Nec, Ench, Bard, Wiz) Necro is the most boring. It's too easy. WAY too easy. <br>
<br>
Only thing easier to play than a necro is a monk. Would be why there is a monk twink anywhere in Norrath you can spit.<br>

It's one of those classes where you have to pay very close attention all the time or you get people killed.  Healing at the high levels is just too involved to really be boring, though I would have to say that at low levels it's quite dull indeed.<br>
<br>
As for fun, I like playing a monk.  One of the few classes that can really explore well, something that is pretty impossible to do as a cleric =( <p><i>Zuht<br>Templar of <a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/blookingglass18403">The Looking Glass</a></i><br>

Necromancer- kicked back, not too much to do high end..can be plenty if you're good in groups. (4)<br>
Druid- Ah christ..Med, solo blue01, repeat..(1)<br>
Rogue- If you can get into it, a great class indeed, very wanted high end. Fairly easy to play however.(3)<br>
Monk- Anyone can play a Monk, or a Monk twink, but in personal experience i've found this class is rather challenging. Being a good Monk takes alot of work. And, before I actually played one to the higher levels, I used to think it was soo easy ;)(4.9)<br>
Warrior- Get near group Cleric, hit "A" ,Taunt, and Kick keys =/ (0.2)<br>
Enchanter- highly wanted class high end game or groups, however get ready to die alot. (2)<br>
Ranger- Cazic Thule says, RANGER01!<br>
<br>
Btw i've never actually played a Ranger, but the other 6 classes I can speak for. However, there is no real 'boring' Class, its a matter of opinion. I ask my friends all the time why they still play a certain class, even though Verant prodded them with the Nerf Stick. Its simple : Classes suit you for your game play. <br>

<br>
looks like im going to have to hunt you down for what you said about warriors =-)<br>
<br>
To me warriors are more fun for several reasons, probably due to my short attention span.  I can't med, ive tried caster classes and i just CANT do it.  I have to be moving 100% of the time, and the only classes that do that are warriors, rogues, and i guess monks (dunno about them... never had one).  Another big issue with me is roleplaying.  Basically thats why i play the game is to play a character.  To me fighting with your hands are not as fun as fighting with a sword... and a rogue is cool, but an assasins life of hiding, sneaking, etc... isnt as glorious as charging the field of battle with blood flowing from the edge of a sword.  <br>
<br>
You might find it boring, but to me its the best.  I think every person is different and each class caters to different people.  <br>
<br>
By the way dear, theres a little bit more to a warrior than pressing the &quot;a&quot; and kick keys hehe... or at least i like to think so ;-)<br>

Personally, I like both the Ranger and Enchanter.  Neither of mine are 60 (or even necessarily likely to see 60), but I know their functions pretty well.  I couldn't be a Warrior.  I have the 'tank' mentality for it, but really like the Ranger abilities I have to turn a situation around.  During the Ragefire camp last night, I had to solo an ldc who just didn't want to pull back to Naggy's lair.  Sure, I had Hero and Kragg, but it was thrilling to come out on top.  Now I have to find out if I can solo one self buffed. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Enchanters can be boring if you're only playing buff whore.  They can also be stressful if you aren't on top of your game or the game engine isn't cooperating (ever had troubles targetting a mob when you just HAD to lock it down?).  They can also be an absolute BLAST when you handle the large pull starting only with 40m.<br>
<br>
It's a matter of what you look for in the game and what you put into each character you play. <p><B><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2 COLOR="#3A6EA5">Jzonn Stormwolf &lt;Final Destiny&gt;</B></FONT><BR>

For large targets, chanters are boring. buff and watch everyone do the work.

<br>
warrior: /yawn way to gear dependant<br>
<br>
Necro/wizard/Mage: Basically I hate doing research for spells so never got very far with them. I found the necro the most fun though by far. I will continue to level my necro some day.<br>
<br>
Enchanter: Very challenging class indeed when in a group situation. But they do research so no thanks<br>
<br>
Druid: I like playing my druid  a lot. lvl 57 now. Very simple to play really. Not much skill required just watch your agro in a group if you are not the healer.<br>
<br>
Shaman: I really want to start up a shaman I think this class while simple to play play with a simple epic to get are very powerful. Also if the shaman is skilled and a bit bold can really pull some stuff off.<br>
<br>
Rogue: Nope run too slow but that damage could offset that for me<br>
<br>
SK/Paladin: While they have interesting abilities they run to <br>
slow so they suck <br>
<br>
Ranger: Now this a class that interests me but not gonna make one again.<br>
<br>
Bard: Class of the Gods. The most fun by far and the class that requires a great amount of skill and understanding. The bard path is not linear. When we get new songs they are not just upgrades of old ones. No each one is a bit different and it really takes understanding to know what all the songs do. How to use the songs when to use the songs etc... Usually what the bard does for a group is so subtle most of the sit, stand, push A button or sit med nuke people have no clue what bards are doing for them. Oh well I ramble. Plus like Casidy my charcter cannot sit still for more than 1.2 seconds at a time.<br>
<br>
what was the topic again?<br>

<br>
Bad twinks is what you are seeing)  Also when they took away the exp penalty we picked up alot.  Before the penalty was removed you had to be a good Ranger to stick with it past 30.  I am not saying there aren't good ones out there now.  With the Exp Penalty you had to know your class because loosing exp on death was very hard. ( There used to be a 40% exp Penalty to level for Rangers, Most of us that are 60 now had too endure the hell levels in the 50s to 60 with it. )  <br>
<br>
A well played Ranger is one of the most fun around)<br>
<br>
When playing my twink Warrior in a dungeon I get very Annoyed when I have to ask the Ranger why they are not snaring.  RangerTwink_01 Says &quot;I never Snare&quot;  WHAT!!@#@#@  &quot;It agros to much&quot;.   /em Disband<br>
<br>
RangerTwink_01 Says &quot;Whats Harmony?&quot;  /em Decides the Ranger aint pulling<br>
<br>
RangerTwink_01 Says &quot;I don't cast offensive spells too much mana&quot;     /em smacks head against wall<br>
<br>
I can go on and on.  People that play a Ranger as a second Character or are new to it please goto the Rangers Glade and read up on it.  There is one hell of alot more to being a Ranger than recoovering your corpse after a train.<br>
<br>
Hehe Sorry for sidetracking)  Most Boring?  Hmm.. I don't really see any of them that are boring it is mostly how you want to play the game)<br>
<br>
Most Fun?  No other class I enjoy as much as my Ranger)<br>

by far. ive got a 52 necromancer as well as fuzz.. and she is fun sometimes. i love being a manawhore, and yelling at clerics when they heal me. but just being a rogue is great. you usually dont haveto pull, you just stand here.. and get to own a mobs ass. i dont like stressful situations, and rogues are just plain easy. except when you're doing a cr.. *shudder*... here mr monkeY! <p><img src = "http://www.iinet.net.au/~arc/slutburger.jpg" align=centre></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uflexuregraverobber.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Flexure Graverobber</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(8/16/01 5:18:03 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://imperialorder.dhs.org/mb/avatar.php?s=c9c4772c705d530d134485be5a259995&userid=17 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: rogue rogue rogue!</span><hr size=1> The classes I've enjoyed playing the most are by far Ranger and Wizard. Nothing beats those two, sure my wizzy has been told how much she sucks since she hit 50 and basicly it got to me and thats why I at lvl 54 retired her for later use.<br>
<br>
Cleric - depending on how you play them they can actually be fun I resently discovered. I see my first cleric as extremely boring due to the fact that she's a plain heal and buff cleric. I started playing my second cleric more offensive and it's alot more fun.<br>
<br>
Shadowknight - very fun to play indeed. I love it =)<br>
<br>
Rogue - I get bored while playing my rogue, granted I do have alot of buttons to push which I like but after awhile it gets old.<br>
<br>
Necro/Mag - Never quite managed the "keep the pet alive" thing..<br>
<br>
Druid - booooooring..<br>
<br>
Pally - resently started one since everyone says they suck, I'll not comment for now.<br>
<br>
Monk - Fun if you're in a dungeon, outdoors it couldn't possibly get more boring.<br>
<br>
Shaman - Extremely fun and you have alot of options.<br>
<br>
Bard - My very first real char was/is one, while I was good at twisting I never quite realized my inability to tank and save the group. Perhaps I should try her again now after learning how to deal with aggro with the ranger...<br>

<br>
however, there is more to it than getting near the group cleric, hitting the auto-attack, taunt, and kick keys.<br>
<br>
being in the middle of the action, often to a certain degree being responsible to coordinate the group and looking for more things to kill while others are mostly just sitting on their butt and medding, can be fun. while it's true that warriors lack some of the versatility (and particle effects *sigh*, i love particles) the hybrids possess, they are the great at what they are designed to do. being great = fun, to some at least. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

on a side note, my personal not to group with again list consists of one person and that's a warrior. <p><center>

More specifcally the puller I guess but monks are generally the puller in raids and such.  However I have been on some raids where the monk pulls so slow I fall asleep. ie) There is a single pull with like 3-4 full groups and the monk asks Mana... ummm ok buddy. :P<br>
<br>
A monk can be an easy class to play but definetally are a class that if well played will keep a group with constant pulls where you will rarely get bored.  A good monk should always have a general idea of the groups mana situation, i know for me i never asked mana updates in regular pick up groups in sebilis.  I always managed to keep the excitment up.. well, this is what people told me anyhow. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=24077">Syui Chan</a> - Retired GrandMaster </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucrydeeossiriand.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crydee Ossiriand</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(8/16/01 8:27:29 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Boring Classes / Fun Classes to play and why?</span><hr size=1> I play a ranger as my main and am currently level 56.
