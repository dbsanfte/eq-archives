In fact Bard and any other class have nothing in common really. Then again a bard and Every class have something in common. Confusing eh? Well a bard has a little bit from Every class in the game. Actually only the necro comes close to being this versatile. <br><br>While a Druid may have utility spells they are quite linear in nature. Also druid do not have a spell for every occation either. &lt;Also has a 55 druid&gt; <br><br>Bards are unique to the world of Norrath. The ablility to juggle 3 songs maybe a 4th on a good day. The ability to run faster than anything on the planet, to heal, mana regen, Dot, even dd a little, kite, fear kit, mez, charm, occasionally stun, create dmg shields, str/agil/dex buff, mini rune, haste, invis, evade, lull pull, debuff, slow, snare, Group invul &lt;at lvl 60&gt; shadow step, melee a bit as well and are GODS of resist. There are few other things we can do but is restricted by time of day. Bards make others Stronger around them. Their songs stack with spells that normally dont allow other spells to stack with them. <br><br>Bards are still not well understood and those that have a twink lvl 20 bard still have no real clue to what they can do. Bards have very defining moments in their career where they go through a serious metamorphasis at several stages. While for pure power, most classes are more powerful, I cannot count how many times the bard has saved the day. I cannot count how many times I have been told, &quot;Wow, I did not know you could do that&quot; when saving the day. <br><br>I read threads where the question is.... What songs do you mainly use? I hate this question. It show a lack of understanding of the class. That question is so hard to answer because it depends on the situation. What mobs are you fighting? What is your group composition? What zone are you in? Is it day or night? What race are the members of your Group? There are several permutations for a bard. Once again a song for every occasion. Bards limit down time severly and can fill the role of about every class. Cleric being the one we really cannot compensate for. But In the past when I have been in groups with no cleric and have a shaman and another decent healer, I have been known to whip out the banjo and twist Niv's and Catana to keep the group at full health. Only the necro seems to have close to this much versatility. <br><br>Our strenght lies in our subtlety, most have no clue to what we are even doing for them. I have received many a tell where after I left the group saying, &quot;Man we were killing so much faster with you in the group.&quot; Now if we just had a group intra zone succor song that would rule. he he<br><br>Also the bard is the only class I know of that can help a group while AFK as well <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Hopefully this will give a better understanding of the bard. I know there are other very competent bards out there that could probably add to this and I have not mentioned everything we can do and definately not in detail. Of all the classes I have played the bard is still my favorite hands down bar none. Even when we had the XP penalties, I would not have given up my bard for the world. There are some minor tweaks I would like to see done for the bard but other than that they by far take the most skill and attention to detail of any other class in the game.<br><br><!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br><br><br><br><br> <p>Cuthbert Dirgewielder <BR>El Virtuoso and Uber Geek of F.U.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ushamanpimp.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shamanpimp</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/10/01 11:16:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=96.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> What Class got most Bonus from VI ?</span><hr size=1> hrm.. this is a pretty vague question... seems basically what youre asking is what class is the best :P<br><br>druids can quad kite with ease, and can travel with ease<br><br>clerics arguably the best epic effect in game for raid purposes, and get the most overpowered spell in the game: complete heal.. and even a group version<br><br>shaman  are the most gear dependent casters, as they get some of the best item effects for soloing (epic and jb bracer petty much enable manaless kills) and raiding purposes (buffs from jb armor/ velious armor / and a couple other items, ie VP primal stick &amp; snare spear)...  and have quite a few things available to them first hand that they wouldnt be able to do on thier own with alchemy (gate potions, personal damage shields).  cannabalize 3/4 + torpor + regrow + bear form + racial regen (troll/iksar) + fungi shirt + fungi stick (only really useful outdoors) =  insane mana regen... hence many shaman dont see wis as too critical a stat as clerics/druids, and opt for more hp and ac gear... you take away these items, soloing shaman would probably drop by 2/3<br><br>i agree with Mr Geek that bards are pretty versitile, and imo, very inderrated as a class... most people don't probly dont expect much more than mana/hp regen, and unfortunately, thats all that some will do<br><br>as far as spell sets, you can't really compare... as each class is really designed for its own thing... <br><br>if youre going for diversity, its bard... <br><br>if youre going for spells that will rake in solo xp, i guess its druids due to quad kiting... <br><br>if youre going for group ability, id give clerics an edge over shaman only because of experience resurrections and complete healing: the sole cause of the insane mob hp in velious...  these 2 spells are what unbalances clerics to where they are required to do anything worthwhile (group/raid wise) in much of the world post 50... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383836><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ujableakl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jableakl</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/13/01 2:11:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=96.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What Class got most Bonus from VI ?</span><hr size=1> /agree Mogur, but I would add that a lot of people are making characters based on, which does most dmg.

There is a point in game where ranger is god melee, then warrior is the god melee and rogues can outdamage wizards. So, who got the most? Verant did.

Of course with enchanters and the in flux of high end seb gear and kunark drops becoming twink gear they are not as essential as once were in groups. Still though we are still wanted in alot of groups for the safety we provide thru mez.<br>we will have to see exactly on what and who dire charm will work on and what it is able to effect to see what happens to enchanters in the future we may become more of a traditional solo class like the mage, necromancer, wizard druid and several others have become in our ever changing world do to equipment available and abilities developing.<br> As for clerics i see them as easily as powerful as any other class in the game thru the power of ch and large bonuses of hit points gifted thru the use of their heroic bond and symbol lines of spells. They are absoluntely essential for almost all high end mobs where almost any other class can be eliminated or done without. Just may take longer to kill the same mobs.<br> I realize i did not say this one or that one is the best overall but what is best depends on lvls abilities and gear. And also how well someone is able to play their class in my opinion every class is the most powerful in the right encounter that  they appear to be neeeded for. And i say  that they appear to be needed for because i have seen sks do a monks job, rangers do a chanters, chanters do a clerics, rogues do a warriors, necros do a mages, wizards do a chanters, druids do a warriors, and so on and so on<br> So i say to you this do not think one class is more powerful then another for it is not the class to make the abilities but yet the person behind that toon being able to improvise and think that makes them powerful.<br><br>  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/urolielkotn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RolielKotN</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/8/02 3:48:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=96.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What Class got most Bonus from VI ?</span><hr size=1> Bards are neat - I agree with Cuthbert, there is a lot we can do that people are unaware of.<br><br>Bet you didn't know bards can do over 2k damage in a minute with DoT's. <br><br>Did you know I can get a regen of about 45 hp a tick going with two songs?<br><br>I can nearly negate damage done to my group using a rune song, with a shaman or enchanter around to slow. Neat trick, huh?<br><br>I think the strong point of a bard is adaptability. There is very, very little I cannot do, though I don't do most of those things as well as other classes (this is where the druid thing comes in, I think - druids are also a &quot;jack of all trades, master of none&quot; class). It's important to learn what to do in different situations; for instance, I'm doing a lot of different stuff if I'm grouped with a shaman or enchanter. I also need to judge whether my group would be better off with an offensive or defensive boost. If I'm grouped with four warriors and a cleric, you can bet your ass I'm singing haste over cantata, should I have to pick.<br><br>I also agree that a lot of the things we do for a group are subtle. After 50, I started to shift towards making my group as efficient as possible. If you cannot swap instruments in when your songs take effect, and melee the rest of the time, consider not meleeing. Shield of Songs is extremely powerful with a lute out - worth more to your group than your melee damage in most cases.<br><br>Bards are cool, if you know what you're doing. I'll quote Kleg here: &quot;A good bard is worth his weight in plat. A bad one is just a pain in the ass.&quot; If you know the right thing to do given the situation, your group will love you. If not, chances are you're just going to frustrate people.<br><br> <p><IMG SRC=http://www.tiannathomas.com/images/roliel3.gif><small><br>-------------- Proud member of the Valiant Crusaders, Ayonae Ro ---------------</small></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm9.showMessage?topicID=107.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm9.showMessage?topicID=287.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=96.topic&index=15><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm9.emailToFriend?topicID=96.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm9.threadControl?topicID=96.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm9.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=96.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm9.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=96.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Diplomacy Corner<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Administration Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm9>Polls, Tests & Beyond</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
