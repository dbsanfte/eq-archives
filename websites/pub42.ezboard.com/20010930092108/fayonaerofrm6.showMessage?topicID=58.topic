I am starting this topic in the NAG board, because I feel it will quickly degenerate into something that belongs here... even if it is created with the most wholesome of intents.<br>
<br>
Naming Policy.<br>
<br>
A dear wise friend of mine, and I were having a conversation last evening and speculating as to the happenings of names....<br>
<br>
Specifically relative to names that 'should not' have made it through the name filter...<br>
<br>
An interesting hypothesis was discussed, and I thought, in my definitive wisdom, to bring it here to you... the experienced and knowledgeable player base of my server... for dispute, repute, confirmation, allegation... or general rant ability...<br>
<br>
The theory goes something like this... That the name filter is a GM monitored function... and therefore, only takes place actively, when a GM is online...<br>
<br>
This would explain why names... manage somehow to make it through the filter.<br>
<br>
Freeport, for example, was the name of a nice druid a while back, that was forced to change his name... after achieving quite a few levels... <br>
<br>
This example clearly indicated to me that there is NOT a database of names that are unacceptable. If there were a database, this name would never have been skipped... or atleast not likely been skipped.<br>
<br>
So, ... share... what are your thoughts on this?...<br>
<br>

my partner in crimes SK's name was from the beginning - Incontinensia Butoxx, that was changed after a petition from a fellow player who found it offensive.. at the same time as she was reported and the GM came for a visit she was grouped with my cleric who had her old lastname... Flexure Seizure, there was no problem with that...<br>
<br>
I've kinda tested this for fun... I now have a monk by the name of - Leathernunn Kinkyfists (no problems so far) a ranger with the name - Luve Handles (no problems either) and my female ogre warrior - Firionaa (relativly new so we'll see what happens)<br>

If after one minute no action is taken, then the name defaults through (if it's not on a hard list of names that will be rejected no matter what).<br>

<br>
/Aask<br>
<br>
<br>
Can I tell you a secret? <br>
<br>
::Looks around:: <br>
<br>
I see dumb people. <br>
<br>
And most of them have characters whose names have the word “wolf” in them.  I see them as I pass through the many lands of Norrath.  Warrwolf, Wraithwulf, Treewolf, hell, I once saw a guy named “Wulfwolf”. <br>
<br>
This just in: <br>
<br>
Your names suck. <br>
<br>
Now don’t get me wrong, I feel your pain…  really, I do.  The name filter limits creativity.  Those Nazi bastards at Verant have us by the balls.  I remember when I made my first EQ character, not 10 minutes after getting home from the software store.   I’d carefully allocated my stats to where I thought they’d serve me best in the battles to come.  I chose the face that suited the character I wanted to portray in my adventuring.  I had even started to come up with my character’s backstory.  Then I hit submit. <br>
<br>
“Your name has been rejected, pick a new one.” <br>
<br>
I was crushed!  How dare the wicked tyrants at VI keep me from naming my character “leethaxorpkdood”! <br>
<br>
(For those of you too dense to detect sarcasm: No I didn’t really name my character that… I’m making fun of you idiots that think names like that are acceptable in a fantasy setting.) <br>
<br>
So Meesta Phrosty, why are joo being so mean and nasty today? <br>
<br>
Simple, I’ve had enough of you beet farmers running around on my server with stupid names.  I swear to god If I see another derivative of Drizzt, Gandalf, or Raistlin, I’m going to reach through my monitor, grab your character by the throat, and choke the crap out of you until you’re at your bind point. <br>
<br>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT… <br>
<br>
/brittneyspears <br>
<br>
Oops, I found your bind point… I killed you again! <br>
<br>
/brittneyspears <br>
<br>
You have lost a level!  Welcome to level 0! <br>
<br>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT… <br>
<br>
My server has a wonderfully diverse collection of such idiots.  In the past year I’ve seen a “Drizt”, “Drzzit”, “Dzirtt” and my personal favorite, “Tzzird”.  We also have a mage named “Ganddalf”. <br>
<br>
“What’s that, Mr. Tolkien?  You’re coming back from the dead to bitchslap this guy?” <br>
<br>
We’re graced with characters like “Hackavelli”, “Dymix Ruffrider” and “Bigtymer Eminem”.  <br>
<br>
::Turns on PA system:: <br>
<br>
Attention: Will whoever let the dogs out please sic them on these retards? <br>
<br>
We have the brigade of twelve year-old girls (or forty year-old men pretending to be twelve year-old girls) that have taken their character names from Pokemon™ like “Flareon MacEvee”, “Pikaroofy Chu” and “Bullbasuar”. <br>
<br>
Swift blow to the head with a blunt object wielded by a disgruntled roleplayer, I chose you! <br>
<br>
Speaking of head trauma, I visited the whineplay boards on EverQuest.com the other day and read a thread by someone that was genuinely upset that his Ogre Shaman’s name was forcibly changed from Mrmojo Rison. <br>
<br>
Hello, McFly?  This isn’t the Sixties, you are not Jim Morrison, and just because you  “Retardify” (aka. Ogrespeak) Doors lyrics, doesn’t mean you’re roleplaying.  I’d like to “show you the way to the next whiskey bar” and slide your brain dead carcass across it into a dartboard. <br>
<br>
Now I know some of you mouth-breathers are going to come back at me with your fingers in your nose saying “But how can you bash people for their names... look at yours!”   So I guess I should briefly explain how my little inky was a slave to a Barbarian family in EverFrost until the day he broke free… bla bla bla bla, nickname given by rescuer bla bla bla, came back for revenge, bla bla bla.  Satisfied?  <br>
<br>
I’m pretty sure some of these trouser pilots could come up with a story about their druid growing up in the ghetto of Qeynos Hills, watching Holly and Cros do drive-by nukings, and drinking 40 of fish ale to justify being “Dymix Ruffrider”.  Or how they broke free of this large red and white ball and got a badge by defeating the trainer at the Freeport gym.  Or how their Ogre ate a lot of mushrooms in the Feerrot outside of the Temple of Cazic Thule and started to think he was the “Lizard King”. <br>
<br>
Sorry, but there’s a distinct line between suspension of disbelief… <br>
<br>
…and bullsh*t. And that is exactly what some of your names are.  <br>
<br>
So next time you want to name your character “Heeman”, “Toopak”, or “Charizard”, consider one of the following options: <br>
<br>
1.       Use the random name generator. <br>
<br>
2.   Go play in traffic. <br>
<br>

<br>
Febreeza was actually a joke on my first characters name.  And no I can't Breeze you plz (tanks don't get spells)<br>
<br>
Rebiza (my very first-random name generated) is an Ikzar... when my brother told me to make a gnome and make her name start with an F and be something like Rebiza... I (VERY offhandedly &lt;IT WAS A JOKE&gt; said Fabreeze and she can make people smell nice)... my brother said no it will be Febreeza and she doesn't smell like other warriors.  Oh lord, it stuck.  Tinytank because her first attempt to pull centaurs from the stable earned her 4 of various levels and with the help of a high level shaman, and high level druid she took them all out.<br>
<br>
Fumbellina (Feb's ugly little sister who will probably never get high enough for a last name) was made instead of deleting Febreeza or changing her name when I was being harassed by some twerp and his friends early in the game.<br>
<br>
Misbehaves (who's last name will hopefully be Frequently) is a Halfling Cleric (hrmm a rogue cleric you say?)<br>
<br>
Mischievous (who's last name will hopefully be Nonsense) is a Wood Elf rogue who smirks mischievously often.  Watch it she *stealth* picks your pocket... ick pocket lint... flicks it away.<br>
<br>
Ahhh well each of my characters is somewhat unique although they all love hugs (hugs every day keep the monsters at bay).  If ya see me hug me. <p><b><i>Febreeza Tinytank</i></b><BR>

I still have some memories of the levle 6 human cleric named Jesus healing the newbies fighting at outside the gates on CT.  This was pretty early on and never heard what happened to him.  I still thought it funny as hell.<br>
<br>
Oh well...<br>
<br>
When I first started I chose a couple names that I didn't ever want to see running around.  Sonofsam was one of those and it still stays nicely reserved on my char select screen.  Everyone should have made up a name they didn't ever want to see running around and reserve it. I know one guy who reserved all the true spelling Tolkein names he could.  He got quite a few of them.  Still, too many ways to spell that damned Gandalf to reserve them all.  I think my personal favotie that I've seen so far on A-Ro was Bygg Ballz or close to that.  Honestly, most of the names I see I dont bother trying to pick apart because I know it's just going to end in pissing me off.  I try to keep my guild members with decent names as I can't abide a kewl d00d name wearing a UDL tag.  It's just not going to happen.  It would be nice if other guilds had the same standard but judging by some of the guild names themselves I don't see it as a likely stance those GM's would take.<br>
<br>
I, personally, don't like reporting names unless it's just do far out there that it's begging for it.  Names like Hitler, Beatpussy, Suxorcock, etc... Oh ya, if yer name has the word &quot;pimp&quot; in it I'll most likely report it.  A lot of them though are pretty funny and I tend to ignore.  There's a lot of kids that play this game as well as women and there's just no reason to be running all over Norrath with a name like Fuxyermama unless your purpose is to offend people for which you should be rightfully bitchslapped.  What I find extremely funny are the ones who manage to slide by the GM's til their 40's or 50's and are then made to change their name.  The whining that ensues... I love it.<br>

I am sure I will find out.  I have petitioned, but it was late, so will re-petition again tonight.  Let ya know what happens.<br>
