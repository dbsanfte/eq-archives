About your idiocy: Seems this AznMailow dude says ya'll gated and got wiped in there too... so maybe Muza wasn't lying (thanks for pointing that out btw, I didn't catch it). Good job on dying in Fear!! ~_-<br>
<br>
About our Velk &quot;wipe-outs&quot;: Hmm, on all the Velk hits I've been on it has taken 3 tries maximum. I've been on 1 Saturday Velk hit (this past Saturday) and he went down on the first try, AND it was at night-time (not during the day, as you claim), so I don't know where you're getting this from. /shrug<br>
<br>
About Vindi: Yeah, 65 people were at Vindi. When did I say we didn't zerg him? 65 is certainly nothing to be proud of, but we still took his ass down (now that we got him down he should be easier to do with less people). But no, we rarely employ zerg tactics, and when we do, it's only because the whole crew is on and wants to kill shit. <br>
<br>
About RC: I never said you didn't kill him, I said you took a shit load of people and died on the first try, which was damn funny seeing as how you leapfrogged us. I know you killed him. Congratulations. Oh, you wanna know why you killed him? XA was nice enough to let you all attempt him. Your welcome for that, btw. ~_-<br>

Oh, damn, some vile, painful blows there Shortyrez! I'm truly hurt. My heart has been ripped out and crushed by your brutal insults! <br>
<br>
For one, I believe you are the one who is lying, Mr. &quot;We Didn't Leave Folks In Fear!&quot; and &quot;We Didn't Die In Fear!&quot; and &quot;You Take 15 Hours To Kill Velketor!&quot;. Those have both been proven to be blatant lies spewing from that trash-hole you call a mouth.<br>
<br>
And how would you know about my clericing abilities? I never do pickup groups... and I have never grouped with you or any of your guild of fecal-slinging monkeys, so uh, put that back in your pipe and smoke it, buddy! I think you'll find a lot of people who I have grouped with or group with on a regular basis (though I haven't been exp grinding in forever) saying that I am one of the better clerics they have grouped with.<br>
<br>
And you calling me a fucking moron... bahahah... I am a complete moron (all that beer kills brain cells), but who's the bigger moron? That, sir, would be you. <p><font color="white" size="3"><b>Geelimp Treefiddy<br>

Hehe, that was kinda funny. I always thought it was humorous that people always thought someone below them was a newbie, and someone above them was a dork. Make sure you never get 60 yourself pal ... would hate to see you end up as a dork.<br>
<br>
Now to the rest of you just let it die. I can assure you that my guild never would have abandoned anyone who was in trouble ... they showed up in the first place did they not? It is also very stressful leading a CR that gets wiped out because people who did something wrong and may or may not have understood what they are supposed to do. Starting shit like this, Terhas, never ends up making you look good in the end and only leaves everyone wondering about a lot of half truths. <br>
<br>
On an up note congradulations on Vindicator you guys. Every time you kill something big like that, something you couldn't kill before, is always very rewarding. I am sure it is a big step for you all and keep it up =)<br>
<br>
Additionally I know Shortyrez and while he may be out of line at times, as a guild we love him for it because it helps keep the rest of us in line headed towards the goal. I can understand that tempers are high at times when guilds conflict with each other ... everyone always sees themselves in the right and there is no real need to start a flame here in the first place when the views are clearly 1 sided. <p><i>~Kelraz Bladesinger<br>

<br>
Instead of posting some form of response that would make sense and maybe shed some constructive light onto this situation, you have reverted back to this clueless approach, mixed in with insults.<br>

Did FD wipe?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;The guilds that wiped asked our assistance...we got three groups and entered...they had people feigned who stood up without /qing at some point and chain aggroed...a bunch...on us...at west camp.

Now, what FD did not know (until it was too late) was that there were some people feigned in Fear, and they did NOT /q out to clear their aggro. Instead they ran over to West camp to help out, and brought trains with them. A few groups evac/gate out, and regather at the Portal to go back in and clear again. All this time, FD gets more of its members to go with them, since some of their own are now dead in Fear.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Considered a wipe, maybe not, chased out is more the term I would use. This does however work as a method of Clearing PoF. Hell until we got the AE thing down that was our method of choice.<br>
<br>
Did XA train anyone?<br>
<br>
Nope.<br>
<br>
Did we bite off more than we can chew?<br>
<br>
Nope.<br>
<br>
Did we endanger anyone but ourselfs?<br>
<br>
Nope.<br>
<br>
So just how did everything get out of control once XA entered the zone? I have seen 0 posts about how it did. It didnt, no actions we took endagered you or any of your guildies. You chose to leave for some reason that only you truely know. I can assume, spectulate and guess but only you know. So let everyone else know?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Tremain is right, we left no one hanging. I rezzed everyone I could at West camp regardless of guildtags or whatever.

I promised no one nothing, especially after no one could listen to some simple instructions.

<br>
Well Parni has already posted about it. One person telling me something, I might disagree with but as I previously posted there were atleast 4 whos names I honestly cant recall, but I would know them if I saw them. <br>
<br>
Mind you this is just the 4 that I know about and said something directly to me. In other words they went out of there way to tell me that FD left them behind. Were they lying? Parni has no part in our guild, why would she lie?<br>

<br>
Zerging Velks... well I find the Term zerg implies a raid to kill something will no real plan besides an all out assualt. We have not and never would approach any 150k Hp mob in such a fashion. We have &quot;Zerg'd&quot; other Targets. Usually Kunark Dragons, well aside from Gore. It works on the lower HP, lesser mobs fine, and is a lot of fun <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
13 hours... Umm no. We were in the zone for about 6 hours yes. We tend to be a late night guild, we started showing up earlier than normal. roughly 2pm PST. That is about 5 hours before our normal raiding hours<br>
<br>
Sure we died to him a few times. We knew we had to few but wanted to give it a go anyhow while we were waiting for the proper classes/people to log in. CR isnt taht tough there, why not have some fun while yas wait!<br>
<br>
Geelimp is somewhat confused. We have taken Velk down atleast 3 times in the past week or so. Yes we have dropped velks in the first try, more than once. Not bragging just stating fact.<br>
<br>
mother fucking Exiled Gimps... From our discussion in game I had really hoped to lay these ill willed feelings against each guild to rest. Instead you sling childish insults. Have it your way.<br>
<br>

<br>
Again with the Term &quot;zerg&quot;. Yes we did have 64 people there. We didnt expect that many to show up. We posted that we needed everyone and had one massive turn out.

<br>
I started the thread to hear the otherside of this card. I do not always see myself in the right. I know I am wrong at times. I can accept that. Just read my other postes every single one in this thread mentions that fact.<br>
<br>
Tempers were flared then, people were panic'd. I kinda think Shortyrez might have done the right thing by leaving. Though it would seem he left some behind.<br>
<br>
It would appear however that Shortyrez will not be happy with anything else aside from a complete apology from XA and for us all to admit he is right, we are nothing but arogant assholes, and we fucked up big time.<br>
<br>
That is fine, his choice. I now know where he is coming from. Not what I wanted or expected but never the less this has happened.<br>
<br>
This thread has changed from anything that even closely resembles clearing up any misunderstandings. I can only take the fact that other things were introduced into this thread as some kind of Rebutle because anything else would to be too intelligent. <br>
<br>
Damm there is that arogance crap again! Sorry  call me arogrant I dont much care. If you can seriously consider the replies you have given to my ask for clarifaction as intelligent and well thought out, you are sorely mistaken and ignorant. Thought it did kind of start that way it has digressed greatly.<br>

It was obviously a miss communication problem.  I see XA getting asked to help by someone, and FD telling XA they dont need their help, and XA helping anyway because they were asked.  I really dont think its necessary to insult anyone in anyway simply because they wouldnt listen to you.  <br>

I see the point being XA tried helping, and for some reason this angered FD, and you left.  Other than coming into fear when &quot;they werent supposed to&quot; according to your best wishes.  I dont see anything XA did as wrong.  I dont think XA trained you, or got anyone killed or harmed in fear by coming in.  So if this is the case, whats the problem?  <br>
<br>
And, Axlelan, you know Im cool with ya bro, but its really not cool to bash a guild because an achievement for them is basically shit to you, to tell you the truth I would expect much more out of a member of a guild i have such high respect for Axle.<br>
<br>
Im not trying to say XA was right here, i really dont understand where we went wrong though.  <br>
<br>
And as for Shorty, i really dont appreciate facts being made up about XA to make us look newbish.  WE have attempted Velk 3 times, once was a few months ago, took 3 tries, 2nd was about a week ago first shot, and third was last NIGHT (Saturday) which was also a first shot, to the best of my knowledge.  If you know XA at all, you would know we never do the morning thing, we simply dont have the crew to do it, and the entire thing about Velk whiping us over and over on a sat morning...you must have the wrong guild, bud.  Its really not cool to bash a guild on its failures, much less false ones. Failures happen due to circumstance, and Im sure even FD has some embarassments that they wouldnt like everyone to know about.  The point is, even if this did happen, how is it relevant to us ruining your night in fear?<br>

<br>
New website looks nice btw.<br>
<br>
As far as this thread goes, I am glad I was somewhere else. I can't remember where I was, but I guess it was a good time to be elsewhere. I think I was doing something productive, like homework and cleaning my apartment.<br>
<br>
Anyway, enjoy your flames.<br>
