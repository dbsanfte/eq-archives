Heres the story.<br>
<br>
I came to Iceclad, I saw a little halfling druid from Kaze by the gnolls, he said, look, Lodizal's up.  I said &quot;WOOT&quot; very excited because I had been camping him for a few days, in hopes of getting the map for my Eyepatch of Plunder (map was last piece I needed) I tell all my friends.  My level 60 cleric friend comes (ehrnam) and we start talking.  He gets a 60 rogue, 2 58 wizzies, 56 bard, and some more there, while I bring in my friends from Vision which included a 57 warrior, 60 cleric, 59 shaman, 59 bard, etc.  By this time, Ehrnam and I were kiting Lodizal for about 10 minutes, waiting for our friends.  When they all arrived, we notice Ikonos (druid, who is still cool =P) pop up.  I said hey, Lodizal's up for me! and he said, something along the lines of not for long. (dont remember exact words, but they were similar) now then, I see some Landslide people file into the zone, there were 16.  While Ehrnam kited Lodizal, he turned around and noticed it was gone.  He traced back and saw Kiliky (bard) running with Lodizal on her back to the Landslide camp.  When my friends got to their camp, the last fireball struck Lodizal and he fell.  I was angry at this point, but I was still in hope of getting the map, since we did have it first.  I talk to their leader, and he said Kiliky had it first (which is not possible, because none of them were in the zone at the time when we were kiting) so then I start talking to Ikonos.  He dropped the map, shell, boots, ring, and 4 spells. First item to lotto (only no drop item there) was the map.  I see some people roll, I roll 69 969 like the rest of them, and come up with 870 something.  I also offered to pay 3000p to loot the map.  Now I wait a few minutes, and still have the highest roll, Kiliky then rolls, and gets a 940 something.  She goes and loots the map.  Well, at this time, I was fumed.  I was shouting at my friends and things, and they were all tict off also. We went back, and now I have to camp Lodizal again.  so in conclusion, those 16 members of Landslide have lost all my respect.  They had no right whatsoever to pull off Lodizal from Ehrnam, then when they find out, to kill him, and not let the 1 item the person wanted to be looted.  Now i HATE posting stuff like this, and this is only my 2nd time, but I am back camping Lodizal, and hopefully will not be Kill Stealed next time, so thanks for reading, and Landslide, be more careful what you do, and how you act, it affects all your reputation.<br>

You had the same chance on the map as any other melee present and your roll was very high, remember that? You rolled 850+ on a roll to mid 900s. So why should we give you the chance to roll on the map if not out of fairness spirit ?<br>
If you had won the roll this post would be about Landslides generosity. There were other people there who have already proven you wrong and had a better sense for the situation.<br>
So take it like a man and admit you have lost instead of spreading half truths and stop your ridiculous effort to ruin peoples reputation here. <br>

 We've hunted together before and I respect you as a player, but you can't kite Lodizal around waiting for people to show up and not expect someone else to take it if they are ready to engage Lodizal.  I'm slightly confused because your original post made it sound like you weren't ready to kill Lodizal when Landslide was, but then you said you were bringing it your group when Landslide nabbed him.  Please explain. <p>Shortyrez Starfury

<br>
Pardon me if I am mistaken, but does anyone else notice a similarity here between this and Varulv's post? Ah, is this a continuation which I have stumbled into?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;You may not steal kills.<br>
Kill Stealing is defined as the killing of an NPC for any reason that is already fighting or pursuing another player or group without that group's specific permissio.<br>
<br>
The intent of this rule is discourage and make note of habitual Kill Stealers, not to punish those who honestly try to work together or those who make an honest mistake. Its enforcement by the EverQuest Customer Service Staff will reflect this philosophy<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
From a post by Ytrok. I cannot be bothered to read that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> whole</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> thread again, but I am of the firm belief that you should play by the rules as well as the spirit. Obviously, I am in a minority of one here :P<br>
<br>
The mob is irrelevant: Lodizal or an orc pawn. If it has been previously engaged, then Verant has <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> explicitly</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> stated that the mob belongs to the individual or group which engaged the mob first. <br>
<br>
I am unsure which person stated the opinion that if you have a problem with that, then simply wait for that person to either (i) kill the mob - unlikely, if not impossible with Lodizal if it does summon? or (ii) for that person to die <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> then</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> kill the mob.<br>
<br>
Yes, option (ii) may go against the spirit of the rules but I may be a little miffed, but could hardly object if someone or a group took this approach. Obviously, it is a hard-assed, arsey way to play, but equitable and fair in a situation as described. Rather that than simply steal a mob which has been previously engaged. Whether the individual or group <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> could</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> kill the mob is irrelevant. Wait for them to die. Hard-assed and arsey, but hey! at least no accusations of kill-stealing. <br>
<br>
Being a bastard is no biggie, and if option (ii) would render one a bastard than I must conclude that I am a wannabe bastard by my own words.<br>
<br>
As explained in the previous thread, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> consistency</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is king: You cannot use the rules to defend your position when it is convenient. Either abide by the rules or freely admit to tip-toeing over them.<br>
<br>
I may know <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> nada</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, absolutely nothing about the high-end game, but I don't think I particularly wish to be involved in that aspect if this thread is the result.<br>

they have done it before so why not again?<br>
<br>
and ohh just thought i should inform that it is very possible to kite summoning mobs.. <br>
<br>
go read the rallos boards and click a few pages back and look at the screens of gainoo lvl 60 bard soloing lodizal.. nothing is impossible just more unlikely..<br>
and from the original incidend with LS taking lodi from quater i say if there is any bard on Aro that can solo him its quater.<br>
<br>
<br>
btw i doubt kiliky would steal a pull since shes one of the nicest people ive met in this game.<br>
and tass used to PP my mobs in seb so go go kiliky he he JK <p><IMG SRC="http://user.tninet.se/~mhf993y/anna/sigfile.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uehrnam.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ehrnam</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Regular Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/12/01 6:40:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=582.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Landslide...</span><hr size=1> I was kiting lodizal for...about 10 min.  (By kiting, i mean running arround sowed taking 500 every now and then when he caught up to me) so at this point its all well and good if anyone comes to take him. (in my mnd) There were only 9 people in IC at that time...i think 3 of them interested in Lodizal.  Tass is taking his sweet time getting people to come, so I say in /gu hes up and pick up somene with my druid.  couple wizzys, another rogue show up. I don't know anything about the Vision people that showed up.  But our group consisted of a pair of 58 wizzys, a pair of 60 rogues, a 51 druid and a 60 cleric. No tank, no slower.  Would have been a really interesting fight, that we very well might not have won <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Regardless I make one more circle of the island (With him still on me) and then start heading back to gnolls. Get to gnolls and....no turtle...weird.  It's late for me at this point and I'm fairly disinterested as I don't need any drops from him, but Tass is as worked up as a catholic school girl's skirt and starts communicating with LS.  At the time they nabbed him from me (Wouldnt be hard, I only had a couple of roots on him for agro) he was deffinately being &quot;Pulled&quot; to be killed, and no longer kiting.  LS would know this if they communicated with the &quot;kiter/puller etc:&quot; as opposed to just nabbing the mob when they felt like.  As I said our group didn't have the best odds for success, but we deffinately deserved our shot.  LS gets a big /rude here.<br>

Edit: Ditched the comments about Kiliky.  /tell me in game if you want to see some of the highlights from my logs a few months ago. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Kiliky would KS a turtle no doubt lol<br>
