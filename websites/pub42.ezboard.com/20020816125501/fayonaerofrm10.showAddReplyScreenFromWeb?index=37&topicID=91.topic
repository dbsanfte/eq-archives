Discussion)</span><hr size=1> It's my understanding that there is an NPC that speaks about the realm of heroes and the five coins at most of the good aligned cities now.  I'm beginning to wonder, if they're the ones who hand out the coins for heroic deeds, does that possibly mean there will be a battle at each site the coin is handed out at?<br>
<br>
To my knowledge, there is not one apperant in Kaladim, Kelethin, Surefall Glade, Firona Vie, Thurgadin and Halas.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure about the Grobb, Freeport and Ak'Anon.<br>
<br>
But there is one in Qeynos, Felwithe, Ogguk, in or near Cabalis, and in Misty Thicket.<br>
<br>
Now, mind you, I haven't seen all of these that I'm sure exist so I don't know where they are located.  I've seen the girl in Qeynos and the one in the Thicket.  He makes me wonder tho.  Why is he in Misty Thicket and not inside the town of Rivervale?  If there is going to be a battle at these cities (assuming this of course), is the battle for Rivervale going to take place in MT and the other battles take place in the same zone as the coin givers?  This theory makes sense if an invasion force comes from within Qeynos/Qeynos Catacombs.  But if there is to be a battle within Misty, is it coming from the direction of Runnyeye?  I would have expected Kithcor first, but the Karanas lie in the runnyeye direction.<br>
<br>
This is just a theory I have, so don't get worked up over it.<br>
<br>
I wanted to be able to attend the gathering this evening, but RL is going to get in the way.  Please think about this and post some condensed notes so I will know what I have missed.<br>

--What Malloy the Songbird said:<br>
<br>
[Thu May 17 23:05:24 2001] You say, 'Hail Malloy the Songbird'<br>
[Thu May 17 23:05:25 2001] Malloy the Songbird says 'Hello, Namyra ! I am Malloy the Songbird.  I have traveled back to Norrath from the halls of the Realm of Heroes to reward those who perform heroic acts in the eyes of the gods. Are you just [traveling] through, or would you like to hear a [song] of my [adventures]? <br>
[Thu May 17 23:05:47 2001] You say, 'i'm just traveling'<br>
[Thu May 17 23:05:48 2001] Malloy the Songbird says 'Very well then, Good Luck to you on your travels.  If you journey to Qeynos, you may want to speak to Jaylia the Faithful.  She has adventures of her own that she may wish to tell you. <br>
[Thu May 17 23:06:23 2001] You say, 'i want to hear a song of your adventures'<br>
[Thu May 17 23:06:23 2001] Malloy the Songbird says 'Ah, excellent!  Would you like to hear about my [childhood] or would you like to hear how I was sent to the Hall of the [Realm of Heroes]? <br>
[Thu May 17 23:06:38 2001] You say, 'i want to hear about your childhood'<br>
[Thu May 17 23:06:39 2001] Malloy the Songbird says 'I was born Malloy Birtonel on a farm in the westerns plains of the Karanas.  My parents, Tralvin and Dortha, were very poor and struggled to keep the [farmstead] going.  Not being able to afford to have all of us in school, my mother taught my bother and I for one hour each day while our sister was sent off to school.  My younger brother and I worked the farm from sunrise to sunset with only an hour and a half for lunch and school in between. <br>
[Thu May 17 23:07:00 2001] You say, 'what farmstead?'<br>
(he was singing the next, that is, he moved about like a bard playing an instrument)<br>
[Thu May 17 23:07:01 2001] Malloy the Songbird says 'Our farm is bright and cheery, O how I treasure it so. <br>
[Thu May 17 23:07:05 2001] Malloy the Songbird says 'From each grain planted to the rain that falls . . . <br>
[Thu May 17 23:07:10 2001] Malloy the Songbird says 'To the sunlight that brightens and glistens it all . . . <br>
[Thu May 17 23:07:14 2001] Malloy the Songbird says 'To the creatures that roam the fields of corn . . . <br>
[Thu May 17 23:07:19 2001] Malloy the Songbird says 'To the moonlight that guides us home, O how I treasure it so. <br>
[Thu May 17 23:07:25 2001] Malloy the Songbird says 'I would often travel to Qeynos at sunset after work on the farm was completed for the day.  I would stand outside the local taverns to recite poetry, while playing rhythms on an old raggedy set of tin cans.  I didnt make a great deal of money doing so but I earned enough to buy me this here finely crafted flute. <br>
[Thu May 17 23:07:55 2001] You say, 'what realm of heroes?'<br>
[Thu May 17 23:07:56 2001] Malloy the Songbird says 'Those who perform heroic acts in the face of the Gods usually get sent to the Realm of Heroes.  While I?m not sure what heroic act I performed, I was sent to the Realm of Heroes by a [vision of loveliness]. <br>
[Thu May 17 23:08:09 2001] You say, 'what vision of loveliness?'<br>
[Thu May 17 23:08:10 2001] Malloy the Songbird says 'While I traveled from Qeynos to Freeport, the most beautiful female I have ever seen followed along behind me.  When I tried to speak to her, she did not respond.  After one of my performances in Freeport, this beautiful goddess of a woman approached me, gently took me by the hand and guided me as we faded away.  I found myself in the [Plane of Music] where a concert was performed in my presence. <br>
[Thu May 17 23:08:31 2001] You say, 'what plane of music?'<br>
(another song)<br>
[Thu May 17 23:08:32 2001] Malloy the Songbird says 'With harmonic winds blowing across the demi-plane . . . <br>
[Thu May 17 23:08:36 2001] Malloy the Songbird says 'The Maestra conducted the creatures without vane. <br>
[Thu May 17 23:08:41 2001] Malloy the Songbird says 'Her voice echoing throughout in a serenity stream . . . <br>
[Thu May 17 23:08:45 2001] Malloy the Songbird says 'Beauty of a goddess, a vision that can usually only be found in dreams. <br>
[Thu May 17 23:08:49 2001] Malloy the Songbird says 'Her long curly dark hair flowing in the wind . . . <br>
[Thu May 17 23:08:54 2001] Malloy the Songbird says 'The most beautiful female I have ever seen. <br>
[Thu May 17 23:09:00 2001] Malloy the Songbird says 'This extraordinary concert was the most breathtaking event I had ever experienced.  Once the performance was over, Ayonae Ro, The Maestra, beamed a smile toward me and sent me to the Realm of Heroes. <br>

--What Bidils the Quickhand said:<br>
<br>
[Thu May 17 16:41:41 2001] You say, 'Hail Bidils the Quickhand'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:41:42 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'Why, hello there, Namyra ! And what brings ya to see little old me? Oh, let me guess! I am sure it is because ya wish t'buy a good spot of Jumjum and listen to my [tale]? Oh, quite lovely so! Why else would one well rounded Human come to see the great Bidils the Quickhand other than to hear of this rogue's great adventures? <br>
[Thu May 17 16:42:02 2001] You say, 'what tale?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:42:02 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'Ahhh. . . I see the gods have found the time to be now for a good ear to lend to my words! So long as ya share the Jumjum, I can speak t'ya of the endless adventures and triumphs of Bidils the Quickhand! Now. . . where shall I begin? Yes! The [beginning], of course! Indeed, quite lovely so. <br>
[Thu May 17 16:42:15 2001] You say, 'what beginning?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:42:15 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'Yes, of course I shall begin at the beginning! No proper tale would begin anywhere other than at the beginning! You see, good Human, I was once a humble rogue. . .er, merchant within this here fair city. Oh, how the Jumjum and gol. . .um, [merchandise] flowed in then! Quite lovely, indeed, it was. Well then, where was I? <br>
[Thu May 17 16:42:34 2001] You say, 'what merchandise?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:42:35 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'Ahhh yes! Those days were fair indeed. How I do miss them! Of course, that is not to say that Bidils the Quickhand does not appreciate the eyes and favor of [Bristlebane] upon him! In fact, it is quite the contrary! I do love a good prank! Yes, quite lovely so! <br>
[Thu May 17 16:43:08 2001] You say, 'what bristlebane?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:43:08 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'Bristlebane, indeed quite the trickster and with a sense of humor! I bet you could not have seen that Bidils the Quickhand would have caught the eye of such a dignified individual, now did ya? Yes, The King of Thieves. . . and merchants finds it amusing when one takes his [possessions]! <br>
[Thu May 17 16:43:28 2001] You say, 'what possessions?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:43:28 2001] Bidils the Quickhand 's eyes grow wide with an eager, child-like anticipation. ''Oh yes! Upon one of my several adventures through this great, glorious land of Norrath, I did stumble upon a [lovely treasure], indeed! Great skill and cunning was used, skill that belonged only to Bidils the Quickhand, and has yet to be surpassed within this realm!'' <br>
[Thu May 17 16:43:46 2001] You say, 'what lovely treasure?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:43:47 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'A lovely gem, far more beautiful than even the most delicate and furry feet of a halfling lass! It was larger than my face, and sparkled more than the most pure of Jumjum catching the rays out of Karana's blessed skies! Indeed, it was a divine treasure to behold. . . but little then did I know that such a treasure truly belonged to the King of Thieves. . . and merchants himself! But no, such truths still would not have [stopped] me! <br>
[Thu May 17 16:44:29 2001] You say, 'so you were not stopped?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:44:46 2001] You say, 'what stopped you?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:44:46 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'Ahh ha! I was not stopped, and the gem was mine! Right from beneath the nose of Bristlebane himself did I take it! That was when he noticed me. . . and that is when I was taken from the humble life of a merchant and placed within the glorious [Realm of Heroes]! Of course. . . Bristlebane took back the gem. What a shame. Indeed, quite so. <br>
[Thu May 17 16:45:52 2001] You say, 'what Realm of Heroes?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:45:52 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'The Realm of Heroes, that is my new home. . . Well, it was. Ahhh, indeed, it is quite lovely! It is where all who catch the eyes of the gods in favor ascend if their deeds be true and worthy enough for note! Perhaps one day, Namyra , you shall rise as well!! Look at Bidils the Quickhand, once a sturdy merchant and now a [humble servant] and rewarder of deeds! <br>
[Thu May 17 16:46:16 2001] You say, 'who are you a humble servant to?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:46:16 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'Yes! Indeed, a humble servant I am! I complain not for my occupation. . . as I am humble. I collect [deeds] and make [recognition] of those who have caught the eyes of the gods. Why the gods do it not themselves, I am lost for answers. . . but, I do not complain. They are gods, you know. Quite busy! Indeed, lovely so! <br>
[Thu May 17 16:46:52 2001] You say, 'what deeds?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:46:52 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'Deeds! Yes, the gods are quite tricky and intelligent, you know! They have found a way to mark deeds in the form of a coin! A coin which one who has been fortunate enough as to accept would give to me. . . or yo one of the [other Heroes] who have recently come to this land. <br>
[Thu May 17 16:47:09 2001] You say, 'what other Heroes?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:47:10 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'Oh yes! I am not the only one who has returned to Norrath in search of Heroes! There are many others, indeed! Although, as the gods, their colors vary. Some are [kind and gentle] while some are [vile and nasty] beings which ya should watch yer back for. <br>
[Thu May 17 16:47:56 2001] You say, 'who is kind and gentle?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:47:56 2001] Bidils the Quickhand sighs heavily, a twinkle in his eye and a warm smile upon his heavy cheeks. 'Yes. . . none so as Jaylia the Faithful, as she was so rightfully named. A lovely lass. Tender as a gentle morning mist. . . Yes. . . Indeed, quite lovely so. An enchanting creature. . . and as pure as Tunare's good grace itself. Maybe ya should visit her over in Qeynos an' hear of her adventures!' <br>
[Thu May 17 16:48:25 2001] You say, 'who is vile and nasty?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:48:25 2001] Bidils the Quickhand glares and spits on the ground beside him. '' I know not why some of these. . . villains are called heroes. It is all part of the plan, I am sure. However, I shall give ya this warning of one of them, perhaps the most vile of all, and that is Kizrak the Tyrant, a brutal creature of the Warlord who has quite the taste for halflings. . . and I mean not in the sense of good grace and kindness!'' <br>
[Thu May 17 16:48:50 2001] You say, 'what recognition?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:48:50 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'Deeds! Yes, the gods are quite tricky and intelligent, you know! They have found a way to mark deeds in the form of a coin! A coin which one who has been fortunate enough as to accept would give to me. . . or yo one of the [other Heroes] who have recently come to this land. <br>

--What Jaylia the Faithful said:<br>
<br>
[Thu May 17 22:14:52 2001] You say, 'Hail Jaylia the Faithful'<br>
[Thu May 17 22:14:53 2001] Jaylia the Faithful says 'Greetings, Namyra , I am Jaylia the Faithful, daughter of Raiston and Launa Lightmist.  I was born in Qeynos while it was under the rule of Antonius Bayle III.  My parents were both paladins of [Rodcet Nife] and protectors of the city.  They saw to it that I learned the ways of the [Holy Knights]. <br>
[Thu May 17 22:15:10 2001] You say, 'who is rodcet nife?'<br>
[Thu May 17 22:15:11 2001] Jaylia the Faithful says 'Rodcet Nife is The Prime Healer.  It was he who sent me to take my place in the [Realm of Heroes]. <br>
[Thu May 17 22:15:18 2001] You say, 'what realm of heroes?'<br>
[Thu May 17 22:15:19 2001] Jaylia the Faithful says 'The Realm of Heroes is a place for those who have proven themselves worthy of being in the presence of the gods beyond Norrath.  My [act of faithfulness] destined me to walk amongst the other Heroes in the Realm.  Many of us have journeyed back to Norrath to seek out heroes who are deemed worthy of the same. <br>
[Thu May 17 22:15:35 2001] You say, 'what act of faithfulness?'<br>
[Thu May 17 22:15:35 2001] Jaylia the Faithful says 'My act of faithfulness came at a time when a dreadful plague shadowed the Qeynos area. The plague spread so fast the priests could not cure the diseased quickly enough. The City Council of Qeynos, with the approval of Antonius Bayle III, put into action a [plan] to end the suffering. <br>
[Thu May 17 22:15:48 2001] You say, 'what plan?'<br>
[Thu May 17 22:15:48 2001] Jaylia the Faithful says 'A group of warriors were sent out into the fields to kill each animal that was infected with the disease in an effort to keep it from spreading any further.  The few remaining [healthy priests] were sent out to maintain the warriors' health.  The priests became ill and had to return.  The warriors became infected themselves and struggled to perform their duties. <br>
[Thu May 17 22:16:09 2001] You say, 'what healthy priests?'<br>
[Thu May 17 22:16:09 2001] Jaylia the Faithful says 'With the exception of the High Priests who were too old to make such a journey, I was one of the only healthy priests who remained.  I traveled out into the fields where the warriors were and cured them as fast as I could.  As I worked my way across the plains, I began to feel a bit dizzy and realized that I had been stricken with the plague, yet I [refused] to waste my energy on myself. <br>
[Thu May 17 22:16:36 2001] You say, 'what made you refuse?'<br>
[Thu May 17 22:16:36 2001] Jaylia the Faithful says 'At that moment, I reached my hands up into the air and shouted, 'Rodcet Nife, Prime Healer of all!  Give me the strength to go on.  Too many have suffered.  These brave warriors have fallen.  My mother has joined you.  Please, allow me to go on so that I may assist the [remaining brave souls] before I, too, join you!' <br>
[Thu May 17 22:16:59 2001] You say, 'what remaining brave souls?'<br>
[Thu May 17 22:17:00 2001] Jaylia the Faithful says 'I continued on toward the remaining warriors.  Again, I cured them as quickly as I could. The tide of the battle slowly turned and the warriors began to defeat the remaining infected animals. There were bodies of fallen heroes and slain infected creatures as far as the eye could see.  I knew then that my [end] was near. <br>
[Thu May 17 22:17:11 2001] You say, 'what end?'<br>
[Thu May 17 22:17:11 2001] Jaylia the Faithful says 'I stood silently with my arms to my sides and looked out across the plains.  I raised my hands into the air once more and simply said, 'I am ready now.'  I then fell to the ground and was raised to the Realm of Heroes, newly christened 'Jaylia the Faithful.' <br>
[Thu May 17 22:17:30 2001] You say, 'what holy knights?'<br>
[Thu May 17 22:17:30 2001] Jaylia the Faithful says 'My parents provided me with a vast amount of knowledge.  I was taught the ways of the Holy Knights at the Temple of Thunder and the Temple of Life.  After the death of my father, I was sent to [Freeport] to study the holy ways of the Knights of Truth. <br>
[Thu May 17 22:17:44 2001] You say, 'what freeport?'<br>
[Thu May 17 22:17:45 2001] Jaylia the Faithful says 'Freeport is a trade city to the east of Qeynos.  A few years after going to Freeport, I received an urgent message from Qeynos.  My mother had taken ill and I was needed in Qeynos immediately.  When I returned home, it was too late.  My mother had passed away due to a plague created by [heretics]. <br>
[Thu May 17 22:17:56 2001] You say, 'what heretics?'<br>
[Thu May 17 22:17:56 2001] Jaylia the Faithful says 'Many years ago, after the Erudite heretics completed the construction of Old Paineel, they began practicing with unique forms of diseases.  These dangerous experiments were not confined within the walls of the dark city.  They expanded their research to the animals in the plains of Karana.  The resident high priests were forced to come up with a cure each time a new plague surfaced.  Years later,  after I started studying the art of curing, my mother was stricken by one of these deadly creations. <br>
<br>
thank you for taking the patience to read this, i don't know how much it has to do wtih the war but i think it's a very hot lead, especially Jaylia the Faithful, after all she died in a plague in Qeynos!<br>

I noticed the orc camp in WC also has a pillar with similar markings as the ones outside CB too <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ustimpy574.showPublicProfile?language=EN>stimpy574</A> at: 5/20/01 6:14:03 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10>Roleplaying & GM Events</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
