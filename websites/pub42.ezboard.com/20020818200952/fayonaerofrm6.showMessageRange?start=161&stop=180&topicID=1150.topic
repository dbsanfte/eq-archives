I had nothing to do with anything he wrote, not do I even want to be associated in any way with what he wrote.  Yes, he may be my RL husband, but in RL he does not in any way act or talk like &quot;Zilor&quot;.  &quot;Zilor&quot; is an idiot!  My husband is not.<br>
     The only thing I can agree with &quot;Zilor&quot; is the fact that we were both in HOSS.  But even that he doesn't get right all the way.  We were invited into HOSS when they were going downhill, but we didn't quite realize it at the time.  We were told they were in the process of inviting more people in.  That never happened.  The guild pretty much went downhill about 5 or 6 months after we joined.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But it had nothing to do with me or &quot;Zilor&quot;.<br>
     I really didn't want to post on this board because of any remarks going to be made about me.  I don't care what you say about &quot;Zilor&quot;, but please don't say anything nasty about me.  I really doubt you can find one person in all of EQ that would say one thing bad about &quot;Goewyn&quot; (me) , except for the fact that I am married to &quot;Zilor&quot;, so don't even bring that up!  Thank you.<br>

(Oh and I suck at doing quotes the nice, prettty, neat way, so live with it ;p~)<br>
<br>
- &quot;I will make Palimax join me for the fight because inside he hates you -<br>
<br>
This remark was made directly to Blearchie by Zilor.  From the couple years that I've read these boards, and in-game interactions, I find no basis for the statement that Palimax hates Blearchie, ergo the statement is a lie.  (Sorry to involve you Pali :P~)<br>
<br>
_ &quot;and because some people from a guild spammed her with some untrue lies about him.&quot;<br>
<br>
This remark was made about Edeina concerning the banning of Zilor from these boards.  *Cough*  Zilor was banned because he behaved like an asshole, plain and simple.  Not one person from &quot;a guild&quot; bothered to speak with Edeina to get you off these boards.  You got yourself banned all on your own.  Ergo, this statement is also a lie :P~<br>
<br>
- &quot;Faust wake up, you are not dreaming, you have potatoe peelings in your pipe again.&quot;<br>
<br>
I know for a fact that Faust doesn't smoke let alone smoke potatoe peelings :P~  Ergo, this statment would also be a lie.  (I know, I'm stretching it on this one :P~)<br>
<br>
- &quot;And has offered me a place in Vision, I will have to sleep on it man.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zilor made this remark regarding Palimax guildinviting him.  I simply have to read Pali's remarks to know this is an outright lie :P<br>
<br>
- &quot;I went from HOSS to CoFE, some of my original friends were from that great guild chum.&quot;<br>
<br>
On this one, it's more of a misleading comment than a lie (same difference in my books really).  Great guild refering to Hoss would be Hoss in it's prime, not when the guild was failing and inviting the world to save itself.  So a half lie on this one.<br>
<br>
- &quot;I was in Phoenix also.&quot;<br>
<br>
Whether meant as a joke or not, which after reading all this crap about how many great guilds Zilor was in, I'd go with it being a lie which he knew would be found out just a little too fast for his taste.  So, I'll be nice and give him the benefit of the doubt and make it a half lie :P~<br>
<br>
- &quot;I have never been Kicked out of any guild, I stayed loyal to HoSS and ToV till the end, I chose to disband myself from CoFE mainly because of bad language and a couple other things.&quot;<br>
<br>
Outright lie on the disbanding from Cofe because of &quot;bad language and a couple other things.&quot;  You were asked to either guildremove yourself or you would be removed.  No questions asked, no second chance, nada.  Outright lie.<br>
<br>
<br>
- &quot;Only a small handfull of people here do not like me so they try to find things wrong with me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Okies, this one simply goes under delusions and miscelaneous crap :P~<br>
<br>
- &quot;All I was trying to do here with this post was to get into a great guild again.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fabrication entirely.  First you posted on the NaG forum, not a place where a &quot;Hi guys, I need a guild&quot; is done.  Your knowledge of your previous history on this forum cannot possibly have given you the idea that your original post would remain without flames.  To add to this, you specifically made the title inflamatory.  You had no wish to peacefully return to EQ and find a guild.  You wished to do stir up the pot.  <br>
<br>
So, in the end, if I hurt your feelings, so what?   Would you like a few more more nails to secure you to that cross of yours?   You are a liar, simple, and a very bad one at that.<br>

<br>
A lie is a deliberate falsehood given as the truth.  Not only do you have to show that the statement is false but that (1) it was deliberately given as the truth and (2) the person knew at the time it was false.  For Zilor to say he &quot;thinks&quot; this or &quot;believes&quot; that is not a lie if that is what he truly believes what he is stating.  <br>
<br>
His slang expressions are also not a lie since they are not being passed off as the truth.  I don't think anyone really believed Faust smoked potato peelings based on Zilor's statement.<br>
<br>
In fact the only statement you have shown that would be an outright &quot;lie&quot; would be his alleged invite to Vision.  I believe you've shown that statement to be false (at least impliedly so), but you have not shown that Zilor knows it to for a fact to be false.<br>
<br>
Also, a half lie is like saying someone is half pregnant.  You are either lying or you aren't.  Don't pull a Clinton. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ulummusl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LummusL</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elite Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(4/2/02 12:20:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1150.topic&index=169>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Hey Zommy.

<br>
K, I figured you read the entire thread so that repeating things weren't necessary but hey I'm bored anywhos.<br>
<br>
Zilor specifically says he was NEVER kicked out of a guild.<br>
<br>
 - If it hadnt of been me that asked you to leave, I had plenty of others nipping at my heels ready to remove you if I didnt. -  Stauquin 3/28/02<br>
  <br>
Stauquin's character holds the guildleader tag of Cofe.  The above quote is taken from this thread, and unless I failed reading comprehension, this specifically states that Zilor was kicked out of Cofe.  Zilor's statement comes much further along this thread. <br>
<br>
There is no way in hell that the man could have misunderstood Stauquin's position at the time, or now,and he obviously knew the statment &quot;I've never been kicked out of any guild&quot; was false, yet still chose to spit it out. <br>
<br>
The statement(s), which meander a bit, involving Palimax are disproven in several ways by Palimax himself.  I'll use this unforgettable sentence of his, as a broad &quot;quote&quot; to cover the several instances where Zilor willfully lied about Pali's state of mind, actions etc.  (I might be a titch liberal about using one quote to cover several comments - please accept my apologies - but most people have already read them, and you already agree that Zilor was lying about Pali.)<br>
<br>
- &quot;I'll give someone a dollar if they can explain that to me.&quot;  Palimax, 3/28/02.<br>
<br>
Regarding Zilor's comments about as to why he was banned from the Ayro boards, I didn't think that I had to find proof that Edeina is a person of principle and would never ban someone because someone asked him to.  Even you know that to be true.  Zilor states that he was banned  &quot;and because some people from a guild spammed her with some untrue lies about him.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is not a belief on his part, this is a willful statement made to inflame people.  Zilor knew exactly why he was banned since Edeina told him in details and told us as well when he banned him.  So, I'll keep to my original position that Zilor knew he was uttering a falsehood as to the reason of his banning.<br>
<br>
(No, I don't feel like finding Edeina's post on it).<br>
<br>
A misleading comment is an untruth, whatever way you wish to choose to interpret the comment.  By ommitting key information, choosing to withhold information, being silent, the person making the said statement is doing so with the full knowledge that he/she is not telling the entire truth.  <br>
<br>
Yes, Zilor was in Hoss, no Zilor was not from &quot;that great guild chum.&quot;  Zilor willfully chose to not mention that he was guilded with Hoss when this particular guild was on it's death bed, and not when it was in it's glory.  Read his wife's post which confirms it.  So, ya, it's half a lie :P~<br>
<br>
So, back to saying Zilor is a liar, and a bad one at that :P~<br>
<br>

How about this one....<br>
<br>
I don't use bad language.<br>
<br>
You can start by reading his post that got him banned and follow up with several otehrs.<br>
<br>
Or<br>
<br>
Look at page one where he claims to be &quot;mistakenly banned&quot; then changes his tune when he's called on it.<br>
<br>
The guy is a case. <p>Blearchie Pooh<BR>

Ok, Zilor is a sweetheart.....ya riiiiiight!<br>
<br>
He's a proven liar, a possible psychotic person, a man who by his own words was ready to cheat and/or abandon his wife, and can't figure out the proper way to use such words as to/too, their/there, our/are.<br>
<br>
Yup, he's a great guy!<br>
