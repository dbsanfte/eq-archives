<br>
The room was at full spawn.  i killed the assassin, then /shouted &quot;free ass mask if anyone needs.&quot;  after i shouted, some twinked rogue with better gear then me started shouting ass sup is camped.  noone was anywhere near the room other then me, and it was at full spawn (minus the assassin that i just killed)<br>
<br>
i proceded to kill the other 2 wan knights that were spawned in the room.  while i was killing them, some enchanter tried to take the room from me and managed to get himself killed.<br>
<br>
<br>
After i finished the second mob, and started working on the 3rd mob that spawned there, the rogue and 2 other people showed up in the room.  they told me that the room was camped and they were cr ing (from a bad pull).  I examined the group, and determined that they were not capible of breaking the spawn in the room that i had just broken, but they were capible of holding a broken room.<br>
<br>
After getting bitched at for about 5 minutes by the rogue, i decided that it was not worth my headache to sit here just to get one more chance at a supplier spawn (i was leaving in 45 min anyways).  I also told manalisi (sp?) that she had some serious issues that she had to deal with (because of her throwing a tanturm like that, instead of have a somewhat intellectual conversation, to deal with the situation)<br>
<br>
So i left the room, because someone needed help breaking magi room, so i went down and solo broke it and awaited his arrival. (he never showed)<br>
<br>
<br>
My question is i guess two fold:<br>
When i arrived, the room was at full spawn, and noone was there.  i broke the spawn in the room, people came in after i broke the spawn for them.<br>
<br>
Do i have rights to the camp? -or- Does the group who got wiped out over half an hour prior to my arival have rights to the camp?<br>
<br>
Was i in the wrong when i insisted that it was my 'right' to camp the room because i broke it when it was at full spawn?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you in advance for your feeback.  if i was in the wrong in this situation, i will adjust my play accordingly.  If i was not in the wrong, that rogue will not be recieving any favors from me any time soon.<br>

<br>
Did you do a Camp check?<br>
If not then they might wantto claim being on a CR still we all know how it sux but if you're not in the camp, you don't have it camped :)<br>
<br>
And since as u stated there was a full spawn they could nothave been on a CR unless they made a bad pull into Ass Up and once again their own stupidity made them loose their camp if that was the case.<br>
<br>
Also if on a CR did you see corpses?<br>
I mean if you camp a spot and are doin a CR my bet is u do a CR at ur camp spot.<br>
<br>
Or they dragged all their corpses to the zone and had a rez there, but that sounds a bit strange camping Ass up with 3 people and no cleric?<br>
<br>
oh well..<br>
<br>
Was ur camp as far as I can tell from the info :)<br>

If anyone claiming a camp ever does so much as step out of the 'camp area' for a few minutes or let a named spawn without being killed for a split-second, you can bet your ass there will be another full group there, claiming the camp.<br>
<br>
But, out of courtesy, I would have called a camp check.  I mean, pretty much everyone has been in a situation where they have been wiped out and have had the annoyance of another group claiming their camp when they return.  But, hey, it's kill or let that jackass kill it in Lguk, so, you had just as much of a right to be there. <p>--------------------------<BR>

Sorry, but this is a very old argument.<br>

A corpse cannot claim a camp.<br>

This is the reason you ask sks and monks and necro's to join your group, so they can fd and claim your campsite while you are organizing cr.<br>

Just had someone claim crypt in seb because they were &quot;coming right back to it after getting a new cleric at the entrance&quot;.  As we cleared the way there, I watched them run right by us.<br>

<br>
Paladin's are excelent soloer's in terms of surviveability once they get the use of their deepwater helm.  <br>
<br>
Generally when i am there, another person will come and join the camp, under the condition that they get exp, sbd, bag, and that i get tbb.<br>
<br>
At that point, their only real job is to sit at camp to make sure noone steals it, and i pull and kill mobs for them.  Generally i will be pulling zols and dars from the bottom floor and pulling them up to get me exp as well.<br>
<br>
I am currentilly level 53.  I play a paladin.  I could solo that room (if it was broke) at 45, or if the spawns there were easy ones (all wans for example) i could solo break it at 45.<br>
<br>
When i used to fight there for exp, i must have lost 10 to 15 tbb rolls to casters who would turn around and sell it in commons the next day (i suppose that is the l guk way though).  Now i am trying to finally get myself one, as it would greatilly improve my char, and i have no cash to buy it with.<br>

                       examined the group, and determined that they were not capible of breaking<br>
                       the spawn in the room that i had just broken, but they were capible of holding<br>
                       a broken room.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
You are an EQ machine dude! I am in total awe of you. Not only can you kill the other mobs in the room, but you can do what not a lone enchanter can do, but what 2 (TWO) others who are there can not do. AND AND you can do this all at the same time as determening that they can not possibly be capable of breaking the spawn in that room that I had just broken, but they were able to hold a broken room. I remember reading something once that you were the guy VI uses to determine mob difficulty when designing zones and encounter balances. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
                      &quot; After getting bitched at for about 5 minutes by the rogue, i decided that it<br>
                       was not worth my headache to sit here just to get one more chance at a<br>
                       supplier spawn (i was leaving in 45 min anyways). I also told manalisi (sp?)<br>
                       that she had some serious issues that she had to deal with (because of her<br>
                       throwing a tanturm like that, instead of have a somewhat intellectual<br>
                       conversation, to deal with the situation)&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for makeing sure it was clear that you could not have been at all in the wrong, but that you could not bother being in the same area as these peeps, as it would lead to physical pain on your part. I was starting to think you may be a little unreasonable, but this clears it up. Now, what blew me away was your ability to diagnose psychological disfunction, and your compassion in pointing that out so that the offending party could undoubtidly get the help they needed. You are a true humanitarian. God bless you. Why they would not take you up on your offer of an &quot;intellectual&quot; conversation is beyond me....you seem like such a reasonable sort.<br>
<br>
<br>
                       &quot;So i left the room, because someone needed help breaking magi room, so i<br>
                       went down and solo broke it and awaited his arrival. (he never showed)&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
I thought you left 'cause you did not want the headache? Is your name Robin Hood? Damn the giving never stops on your side. I just hope that if you felt that he was not capable of helping in the break or holding the magi room you would have told him, but I'm sure you would......'cause thats just the kind of guy you are. And what a selfish bastard for asking for your help and never showing. But at least he knew enough to ask you, and not those other folks......phew!<br>
<br>
<br>
                      &quot; Thank you in advance for your feeback. if i was in the wrong in this situation, i<br>
                       will adjust my play accordingly. If i was not in the wrong, that rogue will not be<br>
                       recieving any favors from me any time soon.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Don't change a thing bro.....you're AWSOME! And that rogue is screwed if you won't be helping him in the future! That will learn him. I am sorry for starting this thread with the whole self-serving cock stuff, I see now that my original assumption was wrong. I'm all emotional now reading your inspirational stuff....I need a hug.<br>

<br>
however, this is not the point. i think dammur was right. i may be biased because i hate lguk and the people hanging out there constantly, but i don't think going to a camp because you actually want an item from one of the spawns there (and you won't sell the item but USE it), breaking it and then holding it (even if you get none to little exp) is wrong. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/udammur.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dammur</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/26/01 5:08:31 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://64.77.120.194/Dammur1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: who was in the wrong?</span><hr size=1> Ledge, before you go posting and making a complete jackass out of yourself, you should go and find out what was going on first.<br>
<br>
I am a level 53 pally.  I have solid gear.  Not great gear, but solid gear.  When a lev 35 has better gear then me, yes, she is a twink.<br>
<br>
I could not save the enchanter because i did not have the mana to do so.  i offered the chanter a 49 res from a friends character afterwards, but the chanter had already found a res.<br>
<br>
<br>
When i mentioned that room was at full spawn, i was indicating how the camp was vacent.  noone was there.  Any decent player 45 + can break the room solo with ease.  some classes may be able to do it sooner, but as i play a paladin, and not any other class, i can not attest to what level they can break the room at solo.  As far as the ass mask, it is just common curtesy (sp?) to tell people if there is a no drop item that you can not use that may be needed by someone else.  To do otherwise is rude.<br>
<br>
<br>
I state that the group was not capible of breaking spawn there.  If they were infact engaged in corpse recovery, they could not.  The ass was up, who sees through invis.  If they were in fact enganged in cr, in all probability they were naked (unless they keep a spare set of gear in the bank).  The ass would kill any one of them, or their entire group, before they could even fully loot their corpse<br>
<br>
Why did i leave the room at the time that i did?  # factors were at work here:<br>
1. The rogue was bitching at me and it was not worth my effort.<br>
2. I only had about 45 min left to play.<br>
3. Someone needed help breaking magi room<br>
<br>
If only 2 of those 3 factors existed, i would not have left the room.  with all 3 at work, i decided to leave.<br>
<br>
If you talk to anyone who has played significant time with me, they can tell you that i am a 'good player'.  not good in terms of performance playing eq, but good as in being a good person.  This certanily does not hold true for you, as you have demonstrated by your lovely post.<br>
<br>
<br>
But ledge, i thank you for your imput, and will give it all the consideration that it is worth.<br>

Though its not hard for something to fly over the head of a self absorbed Dorf Pally.<br>

If your keyboard were a bull, you would be a tit.<br>

Good hunting to you.<br>

BTW why is such a l33t paladin, who can break L-guk til the cows come home, laying dead atm in Cazic Thule courtyard, fully clothed?<br>
