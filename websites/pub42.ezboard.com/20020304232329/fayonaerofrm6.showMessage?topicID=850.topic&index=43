If you see me and you read Nugbar Numskul &lt;Tides of Valor&gt; how would you feel then? Final Destiny and ToV have a huge tension between each other but i have many great friends outta that guild as many others, but when i try to talk to someone or ask a question and i get a cold shoulder due to the ToV tag how does that make me think of you? all i am really trying to say is that there is way too much bashing and 1 asshole gets spready out to a group of twenty people from this guild are bastards and so on. I didnt want to turn this into another guild bashing because yes i know damn well how many of you feel about tides, but as you do i have some great friends in my guild that i enjoy seeing in GC and jokeing around with. This game would be so much enjoyable without the childness and hatered. and for those still bent on not likeing people i feel sorry for you live to have fun dont live to hate you can have a much brighter time in EQ which we spend so much of our lives in. i was mainly ticked about treatment i had been given that day i posted this but i had been wanting to say something for a long time.  and you are all subject to your own opinion and i will not do anything to you for the way you feel besides trying to make you think better. im in game a lot send me a tell if you ever wanna see what a person from ToV is like that you have never met, seems like youve only met the bad ones, dont hate :P<br>

Too bad it has to be said again. I wish I wasn't the one saying it. For starters, its all POLITICS, and thats what make people bitch more than anything else.<br>
<br>
     As a member of &lt;Everquest Guild&gt;, you represent that guild. You may argue that the tag is not like a flag you march under, but the sad truth is that you bear the burden of your own actions as well as your guildmates when you carry that tag. People are narrow minded, and will make judgement calls against yourself and your guild that you may think are totally unfair, since you do not personally display those traits. Not everyone knows you to be anything more than just another piece of text. Thus, people will draw general opinions based on circumstantial evidence presented by a few bad apples.<br>
<br>
    If your guild has tagged as currently active members players who have commonly and continously displayed anti-social behavior (of which is commonly cronicled either here on NAG or by word of mouth), than that is the information that is presented as the basis of opinion. Its guilt by association. As Palimax says, you choose your guild and one might hope you made an informed decision. <br>
<br>
      Another Real Life Example(TM):<br>
<br>
Whatever country maybe harboring Osama Bin Laden may have the perception that the critical view cast upon them by the community who are sympathetic to the United States as being unjust and unfair since it was not &lt;Country Hiding Bin Laden&gt; who blew up the Trade Center towers. The view of those sympathatic to the United States will in return be:<br>
<br>
    &quot;If you stuck your neck out far enough to harbor this Criminal and Enemy as a result of fully informed reasoning (as in you know damn well that you have this violator in your country's borders as your &quot;guest&quot;, you are informed of their guilt, and that you know of the consequences of harboring them), then you must share common sympathy with said violator and are thus, Guilty by Association&quot;<br>
<br>
     In a nut shell, people mainly bitch because they feel they have been in someway wronged. Treat others like crap and laugh it off and you may end up being the ammunition for the Bitch Gun pointed at your self and the guild whose tag you carry. Best advice is to exhibit the kind of behavior that is not of the negative kind of baggage you already have pinned upon yourself by default due to the actions of your company.<br>
