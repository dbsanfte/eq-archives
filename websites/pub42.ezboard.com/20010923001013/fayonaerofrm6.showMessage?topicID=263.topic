Then they petitioned us saying that we were monopolizing Trakanon and that we should get out of the way so they could take their first try at Trakanon. This info came directly from the Guide that answered the petition. Our GM was taken to the box with the leader of their outing and were made to random roll for the first attack.

<br>
The full (true) story is this:<br>
<br>
The server came up, so VV (Vea Victus) and IO/MT (The Imperial Order/Mithril Tower) went for Trakanon. We started with two groups, moving down toward Trakanon. We saw Imperial Order and Mithril tower together, with about 25 in the ills jail. So we decided to pass them up. As we are moving, we begin COTH'ing people down. We ended up with almost 3 groups when we got to Juggs. We stayed at juggs for a while, to COTH more people down. IO/MT eventually passed us up. After we got just over three full groups, we moved in a little further to the reet caves, and hanged at a relatively safe spot (2 reet spawns and 1 jug roamer). IO/MT moved ahead and camped at the end of the tunnel to Trak's lair. We decided that they beat us, to let them have their shot first. VV began pulling Juggs, Reets, etc.. while we waited and COTH'ed people down. After an hour, VV had 4 full groups, capable of killing Trak. IO/MT was still at their spot (at the end of the cave before the bridge) waiting to split the lair. Finally, they get the protector, but Trakanon also comes and wipes them out. So VV waits for Trak to head back to his lair (about 15 minutes), and I (Katia) head out to split the lair. Anyone who has pulled Trak's lair knows it takes a long time because you have to wait for certain pathing. So I stay feigned near the lair...waiting for that certain pathing. Finally, I found the right time and pulled the protector. *I MADE SURE TRAK WAS NOT AGGRO*. As I was pulling, I notice an invis IO or MT druid running around near the lair. When I get past the bridge, Tons of IO/MT popped onto my screen. I didn't see them before because of video clipping issues. I had the Prot split from Trak's lair heading after me and IO/MT was right in front of my face. Apparently IO/MT had done CR in a DANGEROUS spot (with 3 or 4 Jugg roamers). They waited for us to clear it, to do their CR. I didn't know this until AFTER I pulled the Protector. I was feigned near Trak's lair the entire time while the rest of VV was sitting in a cave with no line of sight of their wipeout. I spoke with Tykin (not sure which guild he's in), and he told me that IO/MT had a few people camped out. Of the people they had camped out, there was no way they could take 3-4 juggernauts. So IO/MT took advantage of VV and did CR after we cleared the juggs that roamed in their camp. Ok, back to the pull. I had the Protector on my tail, and IO/MT was in front of me. I had no choice but to pull through them. It was either that or feign where I was and train them. So I attempted to pull through them, but there were so many IO/MT in my way that it was difficult to maneuver. I literally got stuck for about 5 seconds before I could move an inch by a swarm of people while the Protector happily pounded on me for quad 400s. I almost made it back to the camp with the Protector, but I died, so it aggro'd the IO/MT people who did their CR on the path. Trakanon also aggro'd on IO/MT somehow, but that was only AFTER I died. There was no way that I could've pulled the Protector that far if I aggro'd Trakanon because he would've killed me while I was stuck on people trying to move forward. Or I would've heard his footsteps following me. Any good puller knows that sound is very important for pulling. IO/MT blamed me for training them with the Prot and Trak, when it was mostly their fault:<br>
<br>
1) They did CR in a dangerous spot, and waited for us to clear it to do their CR.<br>
2) They trained themselves with Trakanon (probably that druid I saw running around aggro'd him).<br>
<br>
So, IO/MT started swarming me tells demanding to know why I trained. I couldn't answer so many tells at once, so I spoke with one person (Tykin). He claimed that we trained them on purpose to buy time, when we already had enough people to do Trak before they wiped out the first time. We gave them their chance and they failed. We waited another 15 min for Trak to move back to his lair. When he did, we reluctantly decided to move *ahead* of IO/MT this time to AVOID anything from happening like that again. So I set out to split the lair again. Ahhz (another monk that was with us) wanted to drag Trak to the back of his lair to speed things up. So he did, but he didn't pull Trak far back enough. Although it looked like he did, I couldn't see too clearly because my clipping plane was down. So, when I thought it was the right time to pull the Prot (for the second time now), I did, but Trak aggro'd with him and Trak touched me to the mushroom spot. Trak was still aggro, and ran happily into our camp just before the bridge (**THAT IS WHY WE PULL TO THE CAVE BEHIND the IO/MT camp spot**). VV wiped out. IO/MT who was doing CR ***at the end of the cave where Trak has line of sight*** wiped out again, because Trak saw them and killed them. VV had 3 noodle clerics camped out, so we did CR relatively quickly. However, many of the corpses got bugged, and we only had about 18 people. So we moved back to the cave where we were camped previously. IO/MT rezzed at that spot again, and after about 3 more hours, they finally managed to kill Trak with 58 people.<br>
<br>
So in summary, each wipeout was a result of their own fault. Maybe the second IO/MT wipeout was partly my fault because I died pulling the Prot, but I wouldn't have died if they didn't decide to do CR in such a bad spot. They did however train themselves with Trakanon and whatever else aggro'd on them that time. Sure you can blame me for whatever you want, but VV is not a type of guild that would intentionally train people to "buy time" as you claim, and I am certaintly not the person who would do such a thing. We already had enough people to kill Trak when we "trained you", so it wouldn't make sense to "train you" some more.<br>
<br>
We let you have your shot, and you failed. So we took ours. That's how most uber mobs work guys, especially when there's this much competition. However, you were stubborn enough to do CR where you died, and to do this, you took advantage of us killing the juggs roaming all over your corpses.<br>
<br>
Call me what you wish: a bully, a trainer, whatever. But you know what? That's ok. I know I'm not, and I know my guild is certainly not. Ask anyone of our members that was at Trak. Get a GM to check the logs. VV had no intention of training you. Get the story straight. <p><FONT color="RED"><B> Katia Angelfury / Astrel Angelfire</FONT></B><BR>

Sounds to me like the only bad tactics involved here was purposely blocking another raid's pulling path with a lengthy cr to monopolize a spawn.  Congrats though, you managed to kill VV's puller, practice your rezzing skills, and finally get the kill.  Maybe if you actually read Katia's post instead of skimming it looking for something to flame, you will learn where you made a few mistakes and be better prepared next time you spend an entire evening in the lair. <p><img src=http://www.kaseyspace.com/EQ/nenasig5.jpg align=center>

I said you guys finally killed him with 58 people. Did you read my post clearly at all? You probably can't handle the truth. It's easy to blame others without wanting to know the full story.<br>
<br>
Yes, I said somehow you aggro'd Trak because you did. There was no way I trained you with Trak. Even if I tried to train you with Trak, I wouldn't have made it as far as I did (right outside the cubby). Especially with 82739823 people standing at the end of the tunnel blocking the way. I also made sure that I didn't aggro Trak when I pulled the protector the first time. Therefore I do not know why Trak killed you, so you "somehow" aggro'd him. It's very possible that the druid I saw got too close to him. It was a woodelf btw.<br>
<br>
Ok, here's another thought for you. I had no idea that you guys would be foolish enough to do CR where you died (in a very bad spot). No one would think that anyone would do such a thing. Usually you summon corpses and rez at the zone. My job was to split Trak's lair so that VV could move and kill him. Why would I purposely aggro Trak to train you guys (which I didn't) when I didn't even know you were foolish enough to try to do CR there? <p><FONT color="RED"><B> Katia Angelfury / Astrel Angelfire</FONT></B><BR>

I'm Finale Magnificence, officer of Mithril Tower for over a year. I'm 59th lvl Ogre Revenant soon to be Grave Lord and a force to reckon with ;o/<br>
<br>
<br>
First let me say how dissapointed and enraged i am at &quot;Jexmann&quot; and his cowardly post.  It's not going to be a pretty site when we find out who that is.  This is NOT how MT chooses to represent themselves or IO for that matter, but i represent MT mainly. <br>
<br>
I sincerely apologize for whomever that is. They will be reprimanded for their cowardly ignorance.<br>
<br>
Secondly, i did not arrive at the Trak raid until we were just getting ready to kill Trak so i know none of the particulars and will not comment on them.  <br>
<br>
Only things i can comment are my opinions as related to my beliefs in fair play and safe play.<br>
<br>
May i recommend this to all who read: If you see a force that obviously is there for the same target as you, is it really necessary to pass them up?  Is not communication the best way to handle these situations ?  <br>
<br>
I can't tell you how much that word &quot;uber&quot; makes my blood boil.  Why must everything at this lvl be related to it ?  It's hard enough as it is getting a chance at dragons and the like without this attitude of superiority getting in the way. &quot;Uber&quot; is an excuse to be pushy, arrogant, selfcentered and ignorant.  We All want a chance at killing dragons and the only way it's going to happen without posts like this happening is by communicating.<br>
<br>
All i'm saying is c'mon people, let's get together and stop the &quot;uber&quot; madness. Verant in they're infinite madness has made it like it is on purpose to make it Very hard, Very time consuming and Very profitable for them.  Don't let they're madness get in the way of the fact that we all just are trying to have fun ;o0<br>
<br>
Communication is the key my fellow Norrathian's.  Good luck to you all.<br>

We made mistakes, simple and plain.  We are not experienced trak killers, this is only our second kill nor do we know where all the exact safe spots are down there.  We aggroed trak the first time, no question.  Was a mistake on our pullers part.  Unfortunately we have had guilds rush past us, sit 30 people on the bridge, train us from behind and basically use all &quot;the old tricks&quot; to keep us from doing trak in the past, so we were a but quick to judge.  That said, with the outcome, there was no need to come here and spout this crap jax.  While we may have been quick to judge what was happening, I accepted katias explanation as did 99% of MT and IO.<br>
<br>
I also think that with a bit more communication VV would have realized we didnt even get a shot at trak, they thought we took our shot and failed, which we didnt<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

Oh and it was 38, not 58.  Still probably alot by most big guilds standards but we dont have alot of uber gear or levels between us.<br>

<br>
I will go over a few things that happend that night.  First off our monk did Agro Trak while he was breaking the lair that first time.  It was totaly our fault.  He was very excited about what VV was doing behind us and messed up.  We wipe.  <br>
<br>
After reading Katia's Post, I now understand what happend, and why we got wiped again as we were rezing that first time.  Yes, we were in a bad spot to do CR, heh is there a SS down there tho?  I dont believe so.  When we came in that first time we had enough people in to hold the romaers in that area while the 2 rez sticks got everyone back up.  Rozalin and I made the decision to do CR there and were not expecting to have the prot, much less Trak pulled on us.  As Katia explained tho this was unintentional.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, after a few more attempts to log people in we did finaly manage to get CR done.  Also, I was well aware that VV was pulling the Jugs, and that was one of the factors that I based my decision to do CR there on, although in fairness I knew we had to get REAL lucky to get a CR done right there.  I was so unsure that it would work that I had 2 groups ready to fight back down and hold the area for so we could rez in.  <br>
<br>
As it turned out we did get lucky and got in and got CR going.  Another thing to note that at this point, Roz and I had decided that the raid was off.  We were 100% sure VV would not make a mistake.  We had our chance and blew it, and it was VVs turn.  We were ready to finish up CR and go home.  <br>
<br>
Well, about that time VV wipes as per Katia's post.  They recover much faster than we do and so Roz and I are still thinking they are gonna do Trak.  Probaly because of the corpse bug issue (we had 10 or so corpses bugged too) VV pulled back behind us.  So we finish up CR and VV still has not tried to break the lair again, so Rozalin and I decide to go forward with our raid.  We took our time and managed to get everything set and done in a way that allowed us to be successful.  VV didnt try to rush Trak as soon as we killed the Prot nor did they send a KS group in when we attacked.  They showed VV is an honorable group of folks.  IO and MT are not super guilds.  We are just begining to do some of the &quot;bigger&quot; things in the game and are learning.  Not the least of which is how things work between guilds competing for a spawn.<br>
<br>
There are a lot of view points to see things from on the stuff that happend Wed night.  I am actuly glad Katia too the time to share with us the way things happend from their end.  I know I have learned alot from this exchange even though it comes in defense of a slandering argumentative post from Jexmann.  <br>
<br>
Katia and VV, I appologise for MT for any thing rude or uncivil comments spoken between the members of MT and VV.  I also agree with Finale on his entire post.  I should have opened the lines of communication first.  I will do better on this in the future.  <br>
<br>
Thanks Finale and Crooner for posting as well. <br>
<br>
I dont know who Jexmann is, and all I can say is that if he/she is a member of Mithril Tower you have shamed me and shamed our guild.  You have dissapointed me. <p>Baratus Damodred<br>
