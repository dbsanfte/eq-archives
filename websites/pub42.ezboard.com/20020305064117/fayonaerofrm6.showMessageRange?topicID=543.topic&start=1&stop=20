I have allready warned her about turning threads into flames about her, I don't want to start warning others about the same thing. So stop it please. If she says something stupid, flame that. If you want to flame her as a person, then use one of the numerous threads on that subject, don't turn this into another one.<br><br>Yet, I don't think Palimax had a clear intention of hijacking the thread. Good example of how hard it can be.<br><br>About Palimax's first post and Crydee's second, I think those are interesting points worth discussing, but I don't agree at all at this point. If we turn NAG into a fully moderated and proper debate forum, then what is the use in keeping the General Section? And should we make a new section called AGa or somethingfor the unmoderated talk? (Anything Goes- almost.)<br><br>It is true that it would be a headache to actively moderate everything, but that's not the reason I don't do it. Rather, it's because I don't think it would be a good thing. I'll step on any toes I have to, but I get enough mail from scared users as it is. Not talking about anyone unpopular or anyone who have really been flamed, but by people who are simply shy. <br><br>So, what should we do?<br>Some ideas that comes to my mind is to start using the general section more, and maybe to put clearer rules for NAG into print.<br><br>I have no &quot;final opinion&quot; at this point, lets think and talk a bit. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p>Love, Edeina<br>Highelf Arch Mage of Erollisi.<br>Citizen of <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero">Ayonae Ro</a>, member of <a href="http://www.eternalwrath.net">Eternal Wrath</a>.</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uedeina.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Edeina</A> at: 11/2/01 1:31:28 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ubombkneechopper.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bomb Kneechopper</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/2/01 2:42:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=543.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gripe about NAG</span><hr size=1> Perhaps make a section specifically for Hijacking threads so people can get it out of their system before doing it on the NAG board? :) heheh<br><br>On a serious note, there really isn't much of a solution for this problem.

We all agree that the board needs SOME level of moderation.  It has a minimum of moderation now -- hate speech is censored, outright harassment is censored.  I'm also fairly sure that there's a boundry for good taste as well.  I can only guess how long it would be before I got banned if I posted morgue pics and the highest quality child pornography legal in Romania.<br><br>I want there to be a place for people - from every corner of the server - to come and be able to engage in debate.  This board, in it's current state, borders on useless.  The signal to noise ratio is too low.  Nobody on the microphone can be heard above the screeching of the primates.  If we aren't going to ask the primates to leave, can we at least get someone to sweep the floor from time to time; or god forbid at least ask them to fling their dung to one side of the room?<br><br>There's nobody (per se) that I want to see banned.

Your level/class/server/name must be posted.

This can also mean moving flame threads out of general into NAG. It can also mean controlling the amount of duplicate postings we have. We don't need 20 anti-Momento threads and 5 tests.

The part about a big part of the community being morons is also sadly true. Personally I agree with the theory that Scot Adams (the creator of Dilbert) made about the percentage of morons in the world being exactly 100%. Everyone have stupid thoughts, and everyone are ignorant on more subjects then they are in the know. ALSO, many people are painfully aware of the fact that they are not perfect. If people feel that the board is the least bit elitistic, they might not dare to post even intelligent and interesting posts, fearing that someone will decide that they aren't good enough.<br><br>/ponder Crydee<br>Is there any objective way to draw a clear line between content and hijacking?
