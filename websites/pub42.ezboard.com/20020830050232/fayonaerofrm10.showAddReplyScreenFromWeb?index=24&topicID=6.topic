<br>
Figuring now would be as good as a time as any, Scaly began the short trip back to the Hall of Truth to report his &quot;non-findings&quot;.<br>
<br>
No sooner than 3 steps out the door did realization strike Scaly's mind sharper than an Enchanter's clarity or insight.  Mayhaps it was the ale that caused him not to be careful or wary when leaving the inn, but as of now, his mistake for non-secrecy took the form of the 3 burly visages that now stood before him.  News travels fast in Norrath.  &quot;Welcome home Scaly.&quot;, the form in the center said.  Without time to even react Scaly's mind flashed a single thought..<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    ugh....this is gonna hurt</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
With the intention of violence, raw and crude splayed across the faces before him the largest visage dove full strength into Scaly's mid-section, forcing him backwards, pushing harshly and furiously through the Inn's weathered door.<br>
<br>
With the sound of tearing and splintering wood the inn was brought from its jolly escape to a grim reality as a mass of bodies came tumbling through the entryway.  All eyes instantly upon this new spectacle, the warming light of the inn revealed the unmistakable insigna of the Freeport Militia.  Scaly landed hard, his breath knocked from him.  The Militiamen rose leaving the collapsed paladin on the ground.  &quot;Corporal, pick the scum up from the floor and drag his carcass over to the fire.....its time for a little fun.&quot;,spat the one apparently commanding authority here.<br>
<br>
The barkeep wanting none of this shouted, &quot;Take him somewhere else, I don't want any trouble here!  I have customers, this is bad for business!&quot;.  &quot;Shut up, and mind your own!&quot;, barked the leader.  With that the Corporal and the other Militiaman picked up the out of breath knight, and drug him to the fireplace, pushing and kicking aside any patrons that got in their way.<br>

Seeing the soldiers drag a man over to the fireplace, his mind begins to assess the situation.  He also noticed the other patrons, particularly the Paladins, starting to move into action.  Clearly this was not going to end well if something was not done and even then it was suspect.<br>
<br>
For all their intention, the Paladins found themselves struggling to get into motion.  The night of drinking had taken its toll.  They did outnumber the militiamen, but only by a couple.  Any element of surprise they might have used was lost in their commotion.  As the sergeant turned around to investigate, his lips turned up in a grin.  He motioned to his companions to look.  As they did so, he turned back around and landed a solid blow to the jaw of the one lying on the ground.  His eyes glazed over from the blow, but did not shut.<br>
<br>
The sergeant now turned to face the group of Paladins.  &quot;What have we here?  Seems like a bunch of pups want to cause some trouble.&quot;  The two companions began to snicker at the comment.<br>
<br>
The man in green gets up from his chair shaking his head and approaches the center of the open area between them.  &quot;I'd like to ask you to take this outside.  These people don't need to witness bloodshed when they are just trying to relax for the evening.&quot;<br>
<br>
With a snarl, the sergeant barks out, &quot;Shut your face!&quot;  The Paladins stare at the man, but make no comment.<br>
<br>
With a quick fluid movement, the whip is suddenly let loose at the sergeant wrapping around his neck.  A pull brings the sergeant stumbling forward and landing on his knees.  The set of claws quickly brought to point at the fleshy part below the chin.  Turning to the two companions, &quot;Don't move.&quot;  To the sergeant, &quot;You were saying?&quot;<br>
<br>
The sergeant is doing is best to try and just breath at this point.  His face is flushed.  His hands work at the whipcord.  Using the handle of the whip under the chin, the sergeant is brought to his feet.  A quick flick and his purse is cut from his side.  &quot;This should pay for the damage you've caused.  As for you two, see to it your sergeant here gets some rest.  He appears to have taken ill.&quot;  The sergeant is sent flying out the door landing in a heap taking several deep breaths.  The other two rush out to see that he is all right and move him back toward Freeport.<br>
<br>
Turning to the Paladins, the man in green begins to size them up.  &quot;I'd suggest you get this man to your healers.  He'll need some attention, but should be no worse for the wear.  That is, unless you have something else you need to do.&quot;  After a brief pause, the group scurries over and collects the fallen person.  Taking care in moving him, they depart into the night.<br>
<br>
Picking the purse up from the ground, he tosses it onto the bar.  &quot;Let me know if that doesn't cover it.&quot;  He returns to his seat and takes another sip of his brandy. <p><B><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2 COLOR="#3A6EA5">Jzonn Stormwolf &lt;Final Destiny&gt;</B></FONT><BR>
