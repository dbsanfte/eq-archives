<br>
happy because before the split i was afraid that the split server would be even more overcrowded than the 3 old server, and it turned out that it is NOT. Ay Ro peaks a lot later in time than (for example) Sol Ro does, and this is somewhat good for me because when i play there are only about 1500 player online on Ay Ro, and this is decent to find groups or do raids. even at Ay Ro peak time there are seldom more than 2000 player online, compared to E'Ci (even after the split), this is cake. also i think it's nice to be a green server because it makes *your* server somehow special <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
but i was also a bit shocked because i know for a fact that many people who start playing and don't have friends already playing simply click a) on the first listed server (which is ayonae ro because if you run EQ for the first time it sorts server alphabetically) or b) on one of the &quot;cool looking&quot; green server. now, guess what server meets a) + b) now...*shrug* <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

i already saw some more REAL newbies within these last 2 days than the in the 2 weeks before, but this could be my subjective fear of a newbie army taking over EC too... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Additionally, a popup box shows up recommending use green server if you are a new player [and not just someone installing EQ on a new computer.] If you had to reinstall EQ, but still had all your preference and setting files in the EQ directory - then it would probably list ARo on top as you probably used alpha sort.<br>
<br>
<br>
If they turned our server green for a while, it was most likely to try to get more lower level players on our server. Many lower level zones tend to be under utilized to the point that 5 people in the zone = crowded.<br>

Where should people like ME get new members from? Drag em away from other guilds?<br>

I am happy that new players start, dive in, in this adventure called Norrath. Bring new faces, new friends in our world, new ideas and fresh air.<br>

I don't think our server will be too crowded. After all its online since around 6 months and I noticed kinda LESS players lately than more. <br>
<br>
Maybe its just me, but I think anti-newbie-ism stinks. <br>
Those people come in a new game, new world, are completely lost and go like &quot;WOW, COOL! Now how do I kill that bat?&quot; and all they get from people with attitudes like the ones I read above is: &quot;Piss off N00b!&quot;<br>

Im pretty sure most lowlevels on A Ro belong to highlevel people which are already organized in guilds.<br>
<br>
The problem the real &quot;n00bs&quot; will have is that noone realy believes in real n00bism. So many will get the answer &quot;ask your main for stuff&quot; when this poor soul creates his first char in FP and askes someone for guidance or a rusty dagger.<br>
<br>
I heard its pretty hard to get bone chips on A-Ro. Even highlevel necros need to hunt them theirselves.<br>
Necros will be happy to find real newbies to buy bone chips from.<br>
<br>
Some guilds have problems finding new recruits, so the people who start playing on A Ro now, might be their new recruits in future.<br>
<br>
A Ro lacks fresh blood. Here it comes.<br>

so, here comes my point. i like real newbies and i love to explain them (if someone asks me) how some elemental things in the game work. BUT not everyone who says he's a newbie really IS one. let's assume you just bought EQ, installed it, made an account and your first character. you have no friends playing on this server or at all. you log in...and is the next thing you do shout for buffs, heals, sows and a port to somewhere else? no.<br>
<br>
but exactly this is what so many n00bs do, and honestly how many of us knew so much of the game that we wanted things like buffs at the very first beginning of our EQ &quot;career&quot;? well, i didn't. those people i just described are not newbies, they are n00bs. a real newbie can be very amusing, but is nearly always grateful for every advise or help you give him. a n00b spams you with &quot;plz plz plz&quot; tells after you refused to run to another continent and buff (or whatever) him.<br>
<br>
also, i agree that fresh blood is needed and is certainly a nice thing, but i would NOT recommend (this is my own opinion) someone who is completely new to EQ to start on Ayonae Ro, because we have a lot of highlevels and their secondary characters and not much real starter, which means that starting from the scratch with lousy equipment is hard, and seeing your groupmembers in great armor while you only have cloth or leather discourages someone as well. you think it only makes him work harder and be a better player? perhaps. but it's also understandable that he just gets more and more jealous and might perhaps try to beg other people for armor or cash because he wants some nice things too. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucrydeeossiriand.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crydee Ossiriand</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(4/27/01 3:20:12 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Green Server??</span><hr size=1> /agree Livtinth on everything<br>
<br>
Especially the part about sarcastic comments don't mean that the server is against newbies. I would be happy to see actual newbies on this server instead of dumb noobs who think I will just hand over all my possessions to them.<br>
<br>
GFay used to be a place where you could by batwings and bone chips in bulk. The last time I even found someone selling batwings in GFay, it was just some noob who thought I'd be dumb enough to pay 10plat per batwing. At that price, walking to the NPC in EC that sells them is more appealing.<br>

I don't know, for someone like me, it wouldn't be so bad.<br>
<br>
I grew up with the first generation of twinks from PD/HoSS 'bout 6 months after release.  I learned a hell of a lot from those folks, and they helped me out by pulling mobs that could drop things that I could use (even though I had no CLUE what dropped what).  They told me how my druid should help a group, and told me in no uncertain terms when I fucked up.<br>
<br>
I realized they had better stuff than I did - I only assumed they were just better players than I was.  Heck, I didn't know who Torbin was or why I would want to wear his eyepatch!  I was never jealous though.  I was always excited to see a good group in action, and to see places I would have never thought to go to myself (Guk/CT/Unrest/Mistmoore).  By the time I put it all together, I was in my mid-30's and pretty well equipped myself ;)<br>
<br>
I try to do the same now when I group my alts with true newbs.  I do and say what I need to to make the group a success.  I hope the players that grow up after that experience are better off for it.<br>
<br>
The only thing that screws with this server is the economy... everything that is under 100pp is essentially worthless and destroyed... I mean, not many mino axes and FBRs are entering the economy.  For the true newb 8-17th level char, this will make the game harder, because one whole level of equipment is no longer readily available.  When they hit the 20s though, they can get items I could NEVER have gotten in my 20s for prices that are very reasonable.  <br>
<br>
Also people that go in to zones and offer "buying batwings 20pp per stack" don't help the economy ;) <p><BR><br><B><I><img src="http://www.druidmail.com/santerre2.gif">Santerre.</I></B></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uyuegouwindwalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yuegou Windwalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(4/28/01 4:15:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Green Server??</span><hr size=1> A friend decided to start playing EQ on Aro four weeks ago. He was totally new to the game. I twinked him out a bit to give him a headstart and get him more interested in the game. His first impression of Aro was that people are stuck up. No one answered his newbie questions in the zone when he asked in ooc or shout, and people wouldnt hang around long enough to hear what he said in say since hes isnt a fast typer. He has also been constantly dumped out of groups since he is still learning the class he chose, much like we all had to do at first and is still making mistakes. Seems everyone expects even the low level players to be experts. I almost regret having him start on Aro vs a new server. :( I think starting on a established server is the worst thing that could happen to a true newbie. <p><A HREF="http://members.home.net/moonie1/Yuegou.htm">Master Yuegou Windwalker</A><BR>

One new rogue, when I found out was new entirely to the game, I took under my wing.  I help her get better gear, and help her understand why its better (she still has no clue about damge delay ratios).<br>
<br>
I still get a lot of tells from new rogues (or just rogue twinks trying to learn the class), and I always do my best to help them figure out the nuances of being a rogue.<br>
<br>
For that reason, you will never find me in /anon or /roleplay. <p><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://outside.clanpages.com/ullsig.jpg"></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ubelzebuth666.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Belzebuth666</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(5/14/01 8:01:52 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Where a true newbie should play...</span><hr size=1> having someone to help you learn the ropes of EQ is fun but learning by your self is even better if i ever started again i`d start on a brand new server<br>
