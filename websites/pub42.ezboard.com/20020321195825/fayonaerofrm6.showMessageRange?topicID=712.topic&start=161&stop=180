Give me a break. Until you've been in a situation where society has let you down, or just people as a whole, then come back here and post your view.<br>
People don't let down the system, it is the system that lets people down. Get it right.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Halo you whiny little baby. Woe is me, the system lets me down. Wah! Wah!<br>
<br>
Bullshit.<br>
<br>
All sane, intelligent adults are responsible for their own actions. It's a fact not an opinion. Many of those otherwise sane, intelligent adults have convinced themselves that someone else is to blame for their lot in life but they are lying to themselves. I'll happily use myself as an example...<br>
<br>
Homeless: Check<br>
Grow up with junkies: Check<br>
Parental neglect: Check<br>
Total failure of the State to intervene: Check<br>
etc: Check<br>
<br>
I started out with NOTHING and worked my way to a damn good job, a stable, happy marriage, a wonderful son, and a pretty damn good life. I did it on my own because through all the crap I dealt with growing up I understood that the only way I could fail was to pawn my issues off on someone else. Whining, bitching folks blaming their bad decisions on their government, their friends, or their family make me sick. Your father beat you? Too damn bad, be an adult and move on. Make up for it by being a good parent to your own kids. You grew up poor, ant the other kids made fun of your clothes? Too damn bad, be an adult and move on. Kids make fun of other kids. If your clothes were in style they would have made fun of your hair or your name.<br>
<br>
The world owes you nothing. Take responsibility for yourself.<br>

Sure, your past influences how you choose to act, but it is still your choice.<br>
<br>
I was sexually abused as a child.  Does that mean I have an excuse if I decided to sexually abuse another child?  Uhh, fuck no, it doesnt.  I was a geek in high school and was constantly teased by other children.  That doesnt mean I teach my children that its ok for them to tease others.<br>

<br>
Yeah Halo, I can say &quot;get over it.&quot;  No matter what was done to you, done near you, or done nowhere near you but you are obsessing over, if you are an adult  you have the power to move on.<br>
<br>
Trust me, you can't outdo me on personal tragedy...if I can move on so can anyone.  You have the power of self-determination.  That doesn't mean you are the total authority on your life...there ARE people and organizations that have more power than you and they can do some pretty rotten things to a person, but that person has the decision to become a whiny little bitch...or not.  &lt;shrug&gt;  I don't know anything about you but that makes no difference.  If you were tortured, forcibly addicted to drugs, gang-raped, and bludgeoned daily it's up to you how you react to it.  If you can look at an experience; absorb the lessons from it and move on or you can dwell on it for as long as you like, wallowing in self-pity and blaming the bad-guys for your misery.<br>
<br>
Damn right I'm an American but that isn't an american attitude, it's an adult one.  I've had nothing and now I have...well an excess...but material posessions don't define a person.  The actions of others don't define a person.  The only thing that DOES define who you are is yourself.  If you are bitter, depressed, angry, or whatever, it's you.  You can blame someone else but the real problem is you.<br>

/agree<br>
<br>
Personal Responsibility, not many people are willing to take it on nowadays.  It is because people will do stupid things then look around to see who they can blame.  "Well gee judge the company that makes this hair dryer should have warned me that you should'nt use this in the Shower", it is just bad luck sometimes that darwinism doesn't work everytime.<br>
<br>
You have free thought and with it free choice, use em wisely.  I have been to the poor and broke store myself and decided hard work was they way out.  People who don't suffer whiners are generally self reliant,  too.  You get kicked around in life from all directions, you have to pick yourself up, dust yourself off and drive on ( Charlie Mike ).  You can be pissed at what life has dealt you but dwelling on it in self pity puts you in an endless loop of whining.  Sometimes a shit storm rains all over you, take a shower, and get over it.<br>
<br>
So when I see someone like this Walker guy I get pissed.  His family is trying to say he is some misguided boy when he is a 20 yr old man with an AK in an enemy Uniform.<br>
<br>
Sorry, if you want to blame society for your woes then do something about it or STFU.<br>

<br>
i actually agree with keldal here. but.<br>
<br>
i come from the same type of background of you and stymp combined. i dont blame anyone else, it is just shit thats happened. bad shit, but shit none the less. i resent your idea that you can just snap outof it though. but i guess i developped different defense mechanisims than you. i internalize, rather than act out... for refference im stereotyping homeless kids who grew up with junkies to be of the same type. so sue me. ive repressed so much emotions and shit that the only way for myself to feel any sense of relief is to hurt myself.<br>
<br>
some people can snap out of it, yes, but some people just dont have that type of personality. maybe they lack the right kind of help, or dont even know anything is wrong with what they do. thats the thing about personalities. they are the result of years and years of distorted thinking.<br>
<br>
if you dont know what you do is wrong, is it really wrong to you? maybe thats how they view life.<br>
<br>
im in no way standing up for these people... but there are conditions that cause people to do bad things.<br>
<br>
im certainly not on halos side either :P i think hes the type that would make prisions more comfortable, give them tvs and computers and shit. criminals need some type of counciling. if theres nothing wrong with them sanity wise, cut off an appendage or 3. theyll soon learn. or become so disabled they would have to steal/murder with just their penis and eyelashes, and i think most people wouldnt be skilled enough for this.<br>

I agree Halo.  It's all society's fault that people turn out like they do.  In fact, when Taliban John gets sodomized to a lifeless pulp while in prison and people cheer a traitor's death...you can't be mad at us, because society made us this way.  It's not our fault we think he deserves it!  It's society's fault, so climb a rope-ladder up "society's" ass, not ours.  We're the <i>victims</i> here, you said so yourself.<br>
<br>
I'm glad you brought it up.  I'm gonna blame everything I do on society.  It's their fault I was speeding, it's their fault I've was inebriated, it's society's fault that I ran over a couple kids on the way home from the bar!!  Thanks Halo.<br>

Kodimoo, in your example of a person with drug-addicted parents becoming a drug addict himself he could just stop.  I watched a heroin addict go cold-turkey.   Was about the most painful-looking process I ever saw but he just stopped with the help and support of his family.  People can endure any pain if they want to.  Somewhat off my original topic in any case...as long as you are saying &quot;I can't do any better, I'm not strong enough,&quot; instead of &quot;I can't do any better, my daddy beat me when I was six,&quot; then, while I may think you CAN do better, at least you are taking responsibility for your decision <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Nothing wrong with having problems, everyone does.  I just hate to see someone demean themselves by blaming thier problems and decisions on someone else.

*grits teeth*<br>
Ok, from what I can remember:<br>
<br>
'I was a geek in high school and was constantly teased by other children. That doesnt mean I teach my children that its ok for them to tease others'<br>
- Ok, what? I have no idea how you've come to this conclusion, maybe you're reading the wrong thread. My point here is that not everything is black and white, good and bad, stone and sand. We're defined by society, by our experiences, by the people around us. We were born a mould, waiting to be, well, sculptured. Everything that has ever happened, everything we were, we are. So what are you on about? Why would my point suggest that if you've been teased then you'd teach your kids to tease others? Even if that is confusingly what I meant, wouldn't you do the opposite?<br>
<br>
'i think he's the type that would make prisions more comfortable, give them tvs and computers and shit'<br>

'Trust me, you can't outdo me on personal tragedy...if I can move on so can anyone'<br>
- I don't trust you. Because what you've accomplished isn't default for everyone else. People ALWAYS have the ability, I'm not saying we don't. I am saying that people aren't as great as you, as 'superiorly strong' as you. People suffer, and as unbelievable as it seems, more than you. And some don't make it, they don't find the will power to over come the past. But you know what.. that's ok too. People in life aren't always going to live up to your expectations. Ever seen Magnolia? A great movie, and the pinacle for what I mean. Some may beat the past, but for others, they may be through with it, but it isn't through with them.<br>
Ever heard of a guy called Talcot Parsons? Big on functionalism and a theory called Symbolic interactionism. I'm no small scale interationist, but I do see his point when he states that we are defined by others, our life, our mentality. We are shaped, and therefore we act the way we have grown. <br>
<br>
'Get out of jail free cards for everyone! Tell them Halo sent you'<br>
- Now perk up your ears. I'm not saying that tommorrow you can go on a masacre in the middle of a 'mall' and it's fine because you were beaten with a stick early on in life. I'm not saying you can go around sexually abusing people because you yourself were sexually abused. <br>
I'm saying that these people need help. They need us. There is always a reason. There is no good, no bad, just what exists. People do things, everyone does things. No one follows the 10 fucking commandments like a prick. Some sway more than others, and my point is we aren't monsters, we aren't barbarians. No. As much as you'd like to scapegoat these people with a label that just frankly doesn't exist - well you can't. Bursting your bubble. These people are us. They are not evil, they are not the devil. <br>
Oh frig, I've rambled on enough. 11hr shifts kill ya.<br>
Now to finish off christmas turkey. I'll be having it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the next 2 weeks I think. <br>
God help me.<br>

<br>
When you don't want help and you are a danger to society our option is to lock you up or kill you.  When you are grouped with a lot of like-minded folk the options get cut back to just that second one.<br>
<br>
Have you ever argued with a two-year old, a lunatic, or any other irrational person?  You can't win.  No logic, reason, pleading, or even agreement will stop the argument.  Eventually you go away or put them in their room.  When the irrational person is armed you disarm them or kill them.<br>

Yes, i'm reading the same thread.  I was responding to your &quot;Adults are 100% responsible for everything they do? Give me break.&quot;<br>
<br>
In my opinion, yes, adults are responsible for absolutely EVERY action they take.  <br>
<br>
I'm not saying your past doesnt influence how you think and thereby influence how you MAY act, but when it comes right down to it, every action you take is a decision you make and therefore you are completely responsible for the action and its consequences.<br>

<br>
<br>
I know from experience that you cannot win an arguement with an irrational person.  Its simply not possible.  Because in order to win an arguement you have to convince the person you are talking with to your side.  And to do that you have to be able to use logic and facts.  But irrational people do not respond to logic because if they did they would be.... thats right rational.  <br>
<br>
I'm going to assume that you consider insane Keldals statement: &quot;When the irrational person is armed you disarm them or kill them.&quot;<br>
<br>
But to me, those are the only options.  Ok, I take that back.  There is a third option, and that is to disable them.  But that is really just an optional way to disarm them.  Once disarmed the irrational can be held until such a time as they are capable of functioning rationally.  But if it is not possible to disarm or disable an irrational person... then killing them is definately an option.  <br>

There is a wonderful book on the difference between american and european views on self defense called 'No Duty to Retreat,' written by one of my favorite college Professors, Richard Brown.<br>
<br>
For those of you who weren't history majors it boils down to this: for most europeans when you are attacked you retreat from the attacker to prevent an escalation of violence.  This isn't cowardice, it's just a view that it's best to avoid a situation where someone might get hurt.  For most americans the view is the opposite: if confronted by an attacker, make him back down.  If your life is threatened you have the right to respond with force &amp; if you feel there are no other options you can respond with lethal force.  To use lethal force in most european courts you will have to show that you had exhausted every other option...for example you ran away until you were against a wall and could run no further.  In an american court you would prove that you truly felt like your life was in danger.<br>
<br>
BIG difference &amp; one that is obviously related to our disagreement.  Book is highly recommended if you want to understand the evolution of american attitude towards violence.<br>

The way I related it to this topic is that, this Jonny Walker should be responsible for his actions.  The &quot;system&quot; has nothing to do with this.  I know our system is screwed up, hell, the American justice system is one of the only systems in the world the had DEGREES to murder, I am not talking about manslaughter(un intentional) but the Premeditated and the &quot;spur of the moment&quot; killing where someone jsut decides to unload a clip into someone.. That is strange to say the least.  But if the individual isn't responsible for his/her actions, who is?  I certanly don't hold my parents responsible if I dont pay and electricity bill....  In this world there are winners and losers, I don't mean that from a social standpoint I mean this in the sense that either you rise above and conquer your enviorment or it conquers you.  Its up to you what you do, either you fail or succeed, in the end it doesn't matter how you do it, because one day the safety net of passing off blame isn't there, just once, and thats what is happeneing to Jonny boy.  I don't see anythign wrong with playing the system, blaming others, any way to survive, just I'll never respect a man(or woman) who doesn't take responsibility, Jonny Walker chose his path, now he must walk it accordingly.  There is not such thing as a do over in life. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=712.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=712.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=712.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=712.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=712.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=712.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=712.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=712.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a> <b>9</b> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=712.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=712.topic&start=201&stop=220>11</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=712.topic&start=221&stop=240>12</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=712.topic&start=241&stop=260>13</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=712.topic&start=261&stop=280>14</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=712.topic&start=281&stop=285>15</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showPrevMessage?topicID=712.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showNextMessage?topicID=712.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=712.topic&index=180><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=712.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.threadControl?topicID=712.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=712.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=712.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Diplomacy Corner<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Administration Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6>NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
