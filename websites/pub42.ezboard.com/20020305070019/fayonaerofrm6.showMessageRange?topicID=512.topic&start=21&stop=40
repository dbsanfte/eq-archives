What is there to say other then they will be in a position like this some day and probably no one will have any feeling for their cries ... remember that every player in this Guild will sooner or later need someone's help other then that from his guild, but will have a hard time finding it.<br>

<br>
The same, I guess, goes for a couple others in this thread as well, who more than overstepped the boundaries of acceptable behaviour and board posting rules.<br>
<br>
As far as I can see there were no posts here by the accused guild Landslide in an official or individual manner. It boils down to the rant of a person who has a tradition of throwing themseves into the role of a victim and then just cannot stop wallowing in his pain in the most public way possible.<br>
<br>
As I have heard, a GM decision has been made. You may not like the outcome of it, but obviously it was a decision that was in favour of the other guild. As a player and a guild leader in particular you should respect the decision and shut up. The fact that you lack the maturity to do so while the accused refrain from defending themselves in your private little courtroom here, makes you look like an utter moron to those among us who have reached adulthood. Snap out of it.<br>
<br>
There is a saying, and I have to congratulate Landslide on taking it to heart, as this thread is utterly disgusting to read: &quot;Don't fight with pigs, you will get dirty and the pigs will like it.&quot;<br>
<br>
You, Ytrok, are the pig and have proven so on several other occasions when you felt wronged. The best advice one can give people in dealing with you is to ignore you, nothing productive will come out of dealing with tantrum-throwing children like you. The advice I give to you is to go away and grow up. Come back when you have something to contribute to the game and the community other than your hate and contempt of the GM judgements. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ufebreeza.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Febreeza</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elite Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/28/01 4:14:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=512.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://faceweb-004.facelink.com/edit/raw/image/31/4764331.jpg?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I am sad..</span><hr size=1> Winnebago some people are born asses some people work hard at it.

I have camped Ragefire (12 days), and had a guild try to steal it from us.  What Landslide did was wrong.  Period.  No if's, and's, or but's about it.<br>
<br>
If people in Landslide do not agree with what happened, they have two options.  Help their guildmate and prove their words.  Or refuse to be involved and prove their words.  The only people who will know will be themselves.<br>

<br>
i find this behaviour in regards to ragefire, if it happened like described above, very disgusting, very disappointing, and very dishonorable. i also can't understand why there was no posting from any landslide member or officer yet. to me, this can only mean two things: a) there is another side of the story and they don't want to tell it, b) what above posters wrote is completely true.<br>
<br>
whatever it is, i find it disgusting that you can sit 3 days in laggys lair, non stop, WITH A FORCE (not only a fd necro/monk), and then someone else walks in with some people and says &quot;this is our camp now&quot;. WTF is this please. it absolutely shows no respect for other players and their efforts to a camp/mob. aside from the piss poor GM service, which is no surprise, i really wonder what nerves some people have. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ulandsliderhater.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Landsliderhater</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/28/01 6:14:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=512.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yep....</span><hr size=1> Landslide is being a lame and gay Guild since a few weeks, they become the Title &quot;asses of the world&quot; very soon.

If ya ask me a Guild like Landslide that cant kill Nagafen with the own sucks VERY much, hey what ya need to kill Nagafen ? only like 12 friggen alts in lvl 50 - 52 range, and Landslide cant handle that ? YO u guys SUCK SO MUCH THAT u have to steal a camp of a nice person like Fionna.<br>

Nr1. LANDSLIDE<br>
Nr2. another guild<br>
Nr3. another guild<br>
Nr4. dunno i think there is one too<br>

If the LS guys keep doing stuff like that they shouldnt be surprised once they are hated of every guild and once like half the server steals all the camps of LS. Would suck very much for LS HAHAHAHAHA.<br>
<br>
LS even needed help to kill gorenaire, god u guys SUCKKKKKKKK. And they need to steal RF camp to get a cleric epic done, GOD U GUYS SUCK.<br>
<br>
Well i guess we found a new shitty guild on Ayonae ro called &quot;Landslide&quot;. The name is anyway ultra stupid.<br>

<br>
- epic camping cleric has not complained here or presented her view<br>
<br>
- Landslide has not presented their view<br>
<br>
- Ytrok assumed .. or shall we say .. grabbed the role of attorney general, supreme court and Indiana Department of Corrections to conduct the execution of &quot;the terrorists&quot;<br>
<br>
- his cheerleading squad got busy getting &quot;the news out&quot; about the &quot;camp theft&quot;, carefully omitting the fact that the camp was given to the Landslide guild by a GM called in to mediate the case (and from what I heard the decision was confirmed by the lead GM himself as well)<br>
<br>
- at this point, the GM making a decision, the dispute among the guilds should have been settled. If you cannot help to carry a grudge, carry it against Verant for screwing up the cleric epic the way they did by designing it this way<br>
<br>
- instead Landslide is being defamated serverwide (I received numerous tells from obviously unrelated players on the issue and the story got worse every hour). Several guilds that are not involved in the incident at all are joining the bashing for their own selfish reasons.<br>
<br>
- Landslide did not step up to defend themselves. I shall assume for knowing quite well that a smear campaign cannot be won, it can just be cut short by not giving it any more ammunition.<br>
<br>
- instead of one player being very disappointed for wasting hours of camping and favours from friends now people are going for the throats of some 60+ players for wearing a guild tag. How about hanging some niggers next - it's the logical follow-up?<br>
<br>
- Ytrok did dick to help Fionna with these postings and his smear campaign. She isn't closer to her noodle than she was two days ago. All he did was flatter his self-righteous ego that would see the splinter in his neighbours eye and not the log in his own and spread hate against a lot of people whom I know as helpful and generous, skilled players. <br>
<br>
- He should be ashamed of himself, but there is no room in him for all the ego problems he already has.<br>
<br>
That's the last I am going to say about it. I am not advising anyone to leave their guilds, rather think about what good you can do for your friends, fellow players and the game - you will know if you really care about them.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uthekla.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thekla</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/29/01 1:37:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=512.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I am sad..</span><hr size=1> Old news yes but time to be repeated...<br>

A few clarifications for the morally bankrupt among us<br>
Posted by Rayne at 14:45 PM<br>
<br>
<br>
Apparently now my May 8 post on Ragefire is now quoted by some as the &quot;guidelines for all Clerics&quot; when it is convenient for some to do so. So if I get to formulate the rules, here they are:<br>
<br>
Ragefire is up and nobody is there. /Cheer yourself. Go for it!<br>
<br>
Ragefire is up and one or two people are there. /Cheer yourself, mourn the unlucky, go for it!<br>
<br>
Ragefire is up and a questionable group is there. If they aren't planning on spawning quickly (say 15 minutes) tell them sorry, but you aren't ready and we are. Spawn and kill. (Note: if you're the one with the questionable group don't ask for sympathy, etc. They deserve Ragefire too and keeping path clear isn't some huge accomplishment. Sorry, but fact.)<br>
<br>
Ragefire is up and a capable group is in the middle of their final preparations for engaging. Congratulate them and come back another time.<br>
<br>
If you are already camping Ragefire, um, DO NOT COUNT ON #3 or #4 BEING OBSERVED! Some people just don't care about others. Be strong, be buffed, be ready.<br>
<br>
<br>
Because, the only real rule (er, real == Verant) is &quot;mob belongs to Cleric that spawned Ragefire.&quot; If you're there first BE the Cleric that spawns Ragefire.<br>
<br>
There, my completely &quot;official&quot; Ragefire rules. If you're going to quote me then follow rules 1 - 5. If you're going to quote Verant then feel free, but good luck on living with yourself. <br>
<br>
And for Xyun who referred to me as &quot;Anon Gimp&quot; I would greatly appreciate it if in the future you would refer to me as &quot;Rayne the Gimp from EQ Cleric.&quot; Thanks!<br>
<br>
Oh, and one more thing. Verant, if you go look up &quot;epic&quot; at webster.com nowhere will you see the word &quot;rare&quot; in the definition. Epic means heroic, not rare. Thanks for the situation. <br>

 <br>
<br>
Well, I've been afraid of changing<br>
<br>
Cause I've built my life around you.<br>
<br>
But time make you bolder,<br>
<br>
Even children grow older<br>
<br>
And I'm getting older too<br>
<br>
Oh, I'm getting older too<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Ah, take my love, take it down<br>
<br>
H, climb a mountain and turn around<br>
<br>
And if you see my reflection<br>
<br>
In the snow-covered hills<br>
<br>
Willl the landside brought you down?<br>
<br>
Oh, the landslide bring you down<br>
