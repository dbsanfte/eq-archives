<br>
It is really unfair to be a ranger these days in Norrath. I only rant cuz im a lazy fat ass and got nothing better to do.<br>
<br>
Lets compair Paladins/Sk/Ranger and their Parent Class Cleric/Necro/Druid respectively.<br>
<br>
Paladins are the defensive hybrid right? They get the cleric lines of heal/hp buff/ac buff/symbol...They get lower lvl spells of course but still more or less get the good spells and at 59 they get Ressurect or what not (90% rez?)<br>
<br>
Shadow Knights are the offensive hybrid right? (By original theory I think they were meant to be offensive..) Personally I think SKs are the better of the 3 hybrid classes &lt;thus my choice to play one.&gt; Sks get higher AC gear than paladins as far as I checked (i may be wrong with that fancy smancy ToV shit but the quest armor in velious favors Sks correct??). Either way. They get the necros lines of darkness/fear/drain...They get it at much higher lvls but they get it. They also get Feign death, self Dmf, and even Corpse summon.<br>
<br>
Now, we get to the rangers. No offense rangers but when I think group I think Enc/Cleric/War/Shaman/(Rogue/Mage/Monk depending on situation)/SK/Wizard/Ranger/Paladin in that order...in some situations Id take a Ranger &lt;if no Sks or Warriors are there...&gt; but thats my personal opinion. I got nothing against them, i just dislike the fact that my friends lvl 35 warrior has the same HP/AC another friends 50 Ranger...Yes I understand ranger can probably get more aggro with constant snare and they get spells but Id rather have a 50 warrior. Either way, back to the facts. Rangers DO get thorns/heals/regen/snare. Thats not the problem...<br>
<br>
The importance here is:<br>
<br>
For raid situations:<br>
<br>
Necros are useful for DMF/Corpse Summon in raids (maybe some other obscure stuff depending on situation, some necros are good for pulling with the immune crap...)<br>
<br>
Clerics (well yeah, they heal.) are useful cuz obviously heals but also rezzes are good ;p<br>
<br>
Druids are useful for ....hmm...ports out I guess. Maybe an evac =/. Maybe a Death touch? (Old CT)<br>
<br>
well. Shadow Knights got corpse summon &lt;we can use em&gt;, Paladins get rez &lt;we can use em&gt;, Rangers got the ability to take DTs &lt;we used to use them&gt;. But in reality Rangers got screwed out of the only good part of druids for raids in my opinion. Rangers DONT GET PORTS OF ANYKIND...<br>
<br>
I understand in all RP purposes rangers shouldn't port, but should Shadow knights corpse summon or Paladins have a rez (a revive is ok but rez is real good if you think about it). Shouldn't &lt;for gaming purposes and &quot;game balance&quot; more so than RP&gt; rangers get AT LEAST self teleports &lt;gates?&gt;...Give them Tox/WC/BB/DL and they will love EQ (at least I think so). and hell, give them a group teleport...<br>
<br>
The closest thing I can think of to that is Tolans BP? but it sucks to most higher lvl rangers, ToV armor and quest armor is better &lt;at least I think so&gt;.<br>
<br>
Anyone agree/disagree with this?<br>

you make good points but I truly feel the game is unbalanced. remember at one point how verant started changing everything &quot;to balance&quot; the game. well, they seemed to have forgotten about most of it and I personally thought that with the recent launch of DAoC they would add alot of new balance issue stuff.<br>
<br>
i guess its true that people create the problem but i have played a 50 ranger and wouldn't start one. Evacs would make rangers way more popular, at least i think so. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/umomentomalevolent.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Momento Malevolent</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/18/01 8:15:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=598.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ranger's Life isn't Fair (serious read) :*(</span><hr size=1> Oh, I don't know. Rangers are kinda crappy all round. I feel sorry for them at high levels. I have seen them crying softly at the seb zone-in, muttering sadly as they string and restring their bows, all the while trying to ignore the laughter their headgear engenders in the unkind. I feel like cheering when a really, really desperate group finally gives them a spot. They rarely stick it out to 60 unless their guild is light on warriors. Poor rangers: Verant should give them more oomph. The next time you see a ranger, pass them a coin or two, or perhaps just smile and hand them a fresh Kleenex. Take a few minutes to talk to one. Just because we were smart enough to pick a sensible class does NOT mean we should snigger at rangers. Not everyone at the party can dance.<br>

Frankly, rangers get some of the best druid spells (remember druids are a utility class - so snare, harmony, substitute AC buffs, resist buffs, so forth, though not as strong typically) with the added melee damage and specialty spells.  Track, forage (nothing earthshattering, but very useful), nice archery tricks, root (level 5 druid root is more than enough through the game)...  I've grouped with some  excellent rangers 50+, and will contine to do so.  But those folks know how to play their class, most don't.<br>
<br>
IMHO, they fall behind in heals (compared to paladins), but the druid/shaman healing line compared to clerics is always a tad off.  Seems like rangers should get their heals a bit earlier, but that's just my thought.  Other than that, I actually really like the ranger class.<br>
<br>
Rangers don't suck, people just usually are too thickheaded to see different ways to use them.  No class is cut and dry, and they certainly aren't like every other class.  You want to play a ranger like a warrior, play a warrior.  If you expect druid skills, play a druid.  If you want to twist a bit and come up with new strategies, play a ranger.  <br>
<br>
And, coincidentally, as someone pointed out tonight rangers do get ports.  See, after the rangers complained aboud druids getting ports and not them a nice GM granted them their wish.  Of course, they usually show up naked and can only port to one location, but hey - beggers can't be choosers. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
rangers are dmg dealers and a very versetile class.. i rather take a ranger over a monk when i make a group since monks all think they are dietys gift to everquest and honestly they only suck up heals... SKs are defensive how ever strange it may sound.. but its true, however an SK can overtaunt anything... keep that in mind when you chanters get hit.<br>
<br>
there are diffrent situations for everything <br>
for a big bossmob its true its really a cleric/warrior thing but as for shitty seb groups any sk can take the role of a warrior and a ranger can take the role of both rog and snarer<br>
<br>
rog monk and ranger are in the same cathegory they all do serious dmg and thats what they are good at.. ranger can also provide very good buffs and be main snarer..  rog do more dmg then monk and can control the aggro..<br>
monks are good pullers and decent dmg dealers but since they cant control aggro they end up either FDing all the time or a manaburn for the healer...<br>
paladins are awsome for aggro and stuns and they can be primary caster healer on raids..<br>
SK can taunt... period we are not good at anything else, however i heard someone say taunt is a great thing.<br>

That class need some saving grace from Verant. Shadowknights are a very good class for single groups, but on raids they are just very weak warriors with a harm touch that won't even put a dent in a velious mobs health and a summon corpse that is never wanted since you have at least one 57+ necro with you for manafeeding anyway. That they are better tanks then rangers do them no good - Warriors with the defensive dicipline are the ONLY tanks anyway.<br>
<br>
Rangers have a harder time to find a group, mostly because of prejudice, but they kick ass on raids. They can often be used as a TrueShot deathsquad, and even in melee they do huge amounts of damage that doesn't have the same aggro management problems as the evade skill of the rouges. (a few rogues is great for damage, but add too many and they will just transfer the aggro back and forth between each other.)<br>
<br>
Plus, Rangers and Paladins are needed for their special buffs.<br>
<br>
Also, Rangers are good enough tanks for most single group encounters. But yes, a warrior/paladin/sk is better at it. In groups, Rangers are perfect as damagedealer+secondary tank+utility class.<br>
<br>
Finally, if there is only one ranger on a outdoors raid, then he can expect that he won't get to fight the mob they are there for. If the raidforce get five mobs and only want one of them, then the raidforce minus the ranger take that one, and the ranger take the remaining four. Druids, bards and enchanters can also fill this role, but rangers are IMHO the best at it. In any case, this person should be grouped with a magician so he can get back after training the mobs to teh other side of the zone. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Love, Edeina<br>

As far as hybrids go.. I like rangers myself since I am one, SK's are EXTREMELY great for me to have in a group since they sure as hell can taunt, Pally's can at times do the taunting trick aswell.. but I've met several pallys who obviously had no clue on how to get aggro..<br>

In a normal groupsituation I, whether I'm playing the ranger or the cleric or why not both, prefer a SK as a tank, note NORMAL GROUPSITUATION (I don't wanna hear the defensive babble again)..<br>

*screams in agony*<br>
yes, right, you evac out of ToV...yeah... . sure, ports to a raid. and then: buffs (PoTG), RESISTS (group fire and cold resist) and yes, what do you need in ToV?, heals (at 60 a druid heals pretty good, starting at 55 it gets reasonable although a druid is NEVER a really good healer because he misses fast casting over time heals and complete heal), snare, tracking, DEBUFFS (decreasing fire resist and atk), regeneration spells...<br>
<br>
druids are in no way useless (old topic i know), you really don't know much about them. may be true that they are not absolutely NEEDED on *every* raid, but it is never wrong to have 1 or 2 highlevel druids around, even if ranger can kite adds better because they have more hp's and ac.<br>
<br>
to your gripe about the ranger class, the people here already posted why a ranger is a good asset to every raid, outdoor and indoor. if you don't like your class, don't play it. a good played character, may it be pally, sk, or ranger, always contributes something to the raid.<br>
<br>
p.s.: i don't think ranger should get ports, and if, then only one or two self-only ports...but i honestly think that everyone should get a self-only port to his hometown. if you want ranger to have group tp's, then i would like a better tracking skill, a jolt type spell, atk increasing not self-only spells ... you get the point. <p><center><font face=Verdana color=orange>"Old enough to know better, young enough not to care."</font></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ufuzzeexkisses.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FuzzeeX Kisses</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/18/01 2:54:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=598.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /laugh</span><hr size=1> hehe, i think outof the 3 hybrids.. its paladin best, ranger next, and then sk.<br>
<br>
in normal groups i dislike grouping with sks.. yes, they can taunt off me. but a paladin can do a LOT better, or maybe i just group with dorky SK's. i love how paladins stun (so many clerics refuse to do this anymore.. and enchanters often dont have mana). <br>
<br>
as for raids, its true. sks are quite high on the useless scale. you HT for what, 800? i can potentially do 2k damage in 1 hotkey. paladins loh, which is uselful, and they get to be DS whores which i love. rangers give me cop, and sometimes if really really low on healers they can heal :p they also get that neato trueshot disc, which is pretty powerful when it comes down to it.<br>
<br>
if rangers were to get teleport, they would have to nerf the damage output a long way.<br>
<br>
ive been a ranger supporter for a looooooong time (as long as its a smart one) cuz.. in normal exp groups. they crowd control better than the average newb enchanter. they taunt off me better than sub 55 wars (unless its noco har) and they give me regen.. which is very good when im not getting hit too badly. rangers rarely forget to snare, unlike wizards/druids.. and.. they just do a damn good amount of damage, and help me kill way faster.<br>
<br>
if i can avoid it i never group with a SK unless i know them. the only thing i like them for is snare, and theres many people who are better snarers out there. thank god there arent many sk's on this server, and my class-racism (clasism?) isnt shown to the public often.<br>

It's probably the hardest class of all for a noob (let alone being a human SK like yours truly). Personally, I think a lot of Sks are a liability in a group as they solo 90% of the time and are unused to group situations (let alone taking orders!); one of the great things about Sks is that we can solo all the way to 60 if we know what we are doing (although I have met quite a lot of sks whose corpses implied they did not). Eddys point about us being the lowest class of importance on large raids is true: the only times I have died in seven levels have been on group raids! At the end of the day it is perhaps easier to walk our own highly lucrative path (we have no need to be loot whores as we don't have to divvy up any loot and are as a consequence as rich as Croesus!) than to be a second-string tank on major raids, and I personally love the thrill of taking on a mob one-to-one with no cleric waiting around to rez you. I was recently soloing Icy Terrors in Perma, the only player in the zone all day, and it was just about the most exciting thing I have ever done in EQ.

I'll list a few things the SK class has going for it.<br>
<br>
1.  Can solo extremely well.<br>
2.  Can FD to go afk at anytime while soloing (very handy!)<br>
3.  Can FD to go afk and not worry about coming back nakked at any time, anywhere, pretty much.<br>
4.  EQ has a lot of loot as SK and being one of few well...<br>
5.  Ability to taunt mobs/snare/fear/kite blah blah basically save the caster stuff.<br>
6.  With a pet we can  get our damage output more on par with other classes. I've had a pet or two live through a yelinak raid, don't ask me how. (pets post50)<br>
7.  Epic just looks better.<br>
8.  Armor...SS armor looks awesome. Kael looks too much like bard armor.<br>
9.  Its the ONLY class a person with a shitty connection can play reasonably well with and help on raids. ToV type raids.<br>
10. If not able to win more than we lose in pvp, we still can put up a great fight.<br>
11. Lots of Sk only items...oops said that already.<br>
12. In general, an extremely fun as hell class to play as we're not dependant on other classes.<br>
13. Death peace going to a hot key for Luclin...that'll be umm fantastic.<br>
14. Oh yah! We can debuff mobs with nullify magic. Thanks Aeno =P<br>
<br>
Only detraction I see is not having a grp buff for an uber encounter...phhh. Course some classes are just better at some things, but imo Sk's are simply a much more fun class to play than any other. I'm biased though...<br>

First of all, rangers can tank...in limited situations.  With cleric shammy buffs I easily have over 1000 ac and 3500 hps at 55, which while not that impressive compared to warriors is sufficient to get the job done in places like velk's or easier seb camps.  I have tanked frenzy in velk's, disco, and chef.  Is it the most efficient way to get things done?  Heck no, I am always happy in those situations to see a warrior join the group.  But in a pinch it can be done<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
However tanking is obviously not our primary skill.  We are excellent, however, at damage dealing and aggro control (and with jolt/root ability we can do that damage without having to periodically flop on the ground<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  The part I enjoy most is controlling aggro.  Mob beating the snot out of the chanter/shammy etc.?  Flame lick/flame lick, wait a few seconds then jolt or root and back off.  Of course on raid level mobs the chances are you won't last long, but it's worth it if you just kept a critically needed person alive.  In normal exp groups root is also a great mez breaking tool, as hopefully by the time it wears off the mob will be glued to the tanks rather than make a beeline for the chanter as sometimes seems to happen with a warrior breaking mez.  <br>
This is not even mentioning trueshot, weaponshield, coe/strength of nature/predator/chloro buffs, tracking, etc. that others have brought up.  I don't feel I need ports, or quite frankly any other additional abilities in order to be a contributing member of an exp group or raid.  Not to mention it's bad enough being bugged for ports while playing my druid, double the port requests and I'd probably have to go on some deranged rampage<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

    As a human ranger I've heard all the lowbrow, inept &quot;Anti Ranger&quot; comments you could imagine.  All the top rangers I know can easily handle themselves in groups as well as Raid situations.  Now while I'm not yer average equipped ranger ( 1400 ac 3K hps 1400+ atk self)  I'm not the top equipped ranger either.  And in most situations I can handle tanking for groups, and sure as hell carry my damage output weight on Raids.<br>
<br>
While there was a time when it was a heavy burden to allow any hybrid into yer exp group ( remember 40% exp penalty? eppp).  And many of us leveled up while bearing it, I assure you that having a hybrid ( played well of course) in your group is a good thing.  Think Flexibility and you'll enjoy the game more, endure the mindset that you have to have certain combos in your group before you'll do well and perhaps Tic Tac toe is more your game.  I just love minds that are so inflexible they miss out on real fun ;P  <br>
<br>
As someone so wisely said early, there is no awful/perfect classes.  Just play what you wish to play <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

<br>
They have something called humility.<br>
<br>
You see a ranger at a raid who is doing something useful, you see a player who is genuinely happy.  On raids, 90% of rangers will not complain about being the only one to buff an entire raid party, will complain about being the designated snarer (and a huge target), and will not complain about dying in general because of their class faults.<br>
<br>
Rangers have been through the darkness that is class prejudice, and they are mostly out now, and very happy to just be where they are.  Usually they fufill their purpose, and do it well and can be happy about that.<br>
<br>
For a while, rogues were the same way...We received brutal verbal and mental beatings for suffering through the dark ages of rogueliness (from release to about a year in), and once we got out and started accelling, we were just happy to do good.<br>
<br>
Then the twinks came.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I've wandered off track..<br>
<br>
Rangers are the best in game snarers, have class buffs that no one else can give you (that rock, and the casters never complain about handing them out), can compete with rogues for short term manaless damage dealing, and most importantly, are willing to do just about everything to help out a raid.<br>
