<br>
No one owns a plain, or a spawn or anything in this game. It's called fair play. Well, today, it was not fair play at all in Fear... it was a &quot;I own j00!&quot; over every spawn. Let me explain.<br>
<br>
We (our guild) gathered to enter the PoF before the respawn, which was very slow. Upon entrance, we knew we were not going to be alone in there, Sanguine Cruisaders (spelling may be wrong) was there. A very nice guild, which i would help anytime. Had good hunting adventures along them in PoF and in PoH. Another guild... Circle of the dark heroes. Well, from them, i cannot say the same. They were rude, using european languages to cuss over. And were placing pullers on ALL pull spots all over fear. Claiming any spawn, and KSing pulls our puller were barely able to get as they spawned. We tried to work it out... but indeed, it never worked. Resulting in the thing i hate the most, is to abdicate to another guild. Even petitions didn't get an answer... no GM were online.<br>
<br>
Anyone else ever had bad adventures involving Circle of the dark heroes???? I would like to hear about that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ulivtinth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Livtinth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elite Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(3/5/01 5:19:39 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Got totaly Shafted in PoF....</span><hr size=1> i posted the link to your &quot;complaint&quot; on their messageboard and i hope that their leader or an officer will comment the situation asap.<br>
<br>
i can't say much because a) i know some people in the guild (not that good to call them friends though), b) we didn't hear their side of what happened yet, c) they won't like to hear this, but it is known that they have some problems due to guildsize and different opinions, and although they will hopefully resolve these problems soon they already pissed off some (ex-)members, and last but not least d) i wasn't there in PoF.<br>

<br>
But first: thanks to Livtinth for posting the link in our forum. And the question to Rassal why he was not on our forum to discuss the problem with us. That is what I call fair. But ok. <br>
<br>
And now the situation like I have it in my mind. On that day we were waiting realy long time for the spawn. Im not sure but I think there were three guilds on PoF. That’s right. Someone asked if we use ooc and we – and I remember the other two guilds too – answer that we will NOT use ooc for commands. We camped at FF house. When spawn started, we got nearly NO pull. Lots of time our pullers were late. So we moved to the bell. Don’t know where the others are camping. As you can imagine lots of pullers ran all over fear to find one spawn. I don’t know hwo many spawnpoint there are on fear, but we are surely not enough people to place a puller on every one of them. Funny idea. Suddenly someone – don’t know who and from what guild – started to shout or ooc the pulls. Than someone shouted we were stealing pulls. As a cleric im no puller. So I don’t know where our pullers get the few mob from. But one of these so called KS pulls a saw live cause it started with me. I was sitting and medding when suddenly a scareling hits me from behind 9 times. All guildmembers around me attacked and killed the mob. I think that’s the normal way it should happen. When the scareling was nearly dead <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> [Sat Mar 03 23:22:11 2001] Anukar says, 'GOD DAMNIT ASSHOLES STOP TAKING MY FUCKING PULLS'</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Well. Maybe it was her pull. If that is true, why did she pull the mob directly to our camp ? As a puller – and im a cleric and NO puller – I have to know, that every mob aggroes sitting people. And that was not the only so called pull that was pulled in our camp. So maybe we took one or two of their pulls. I really don’t know. If that happened im really sorry. Our pullers told us, that they took some of their pulls. Such things can happen if a plane is empty and lots of people try to get a spawn. No offense for that. But if someone has a problem with us, I think it will be fair game to come to us and try to discuss it after the event. Sure we didn’t. But also we didn’t post it on this board. <br>
<br>
And about the words Anukar uses. Hmm. Well. Even if im VERY angry I will not call someone asshole.<br>
<br>
And now with the language. If I look in other zones there are often shouts and oocs in other languages than english. All these shouts and oocs are rude ? Strange. We started using ooc and shouts AFTER someone – I think it was Galahad – used it. Is it forbidden ? Sure there are some of them in german. But such things happen. <br>
<br>
And for the things Livtinth say: well. We are a guild of more than 60 Main Chars. I think it happens in EVERY guild this size that people come and go. And some of the people leaving ARE pissed of. That’s right. But again such things happen. Im sure there is NO greater guild without people leaving. <br>
<br>
A little sidenote. After IO leaves the plane we had no problems with the remaining guild. <br>
Two weeks ago we were on Hate with another guild and had no problems with them. <br>
<br>
That’s for now. As mostly in such situations noone can say who was right and who was wrong. So normaly i forget such situations and look forward. But as the guildleader of CoDH I have to answer. But this posting will be my only reaction. So belive me or not. Its totally yours. We are no KSers<br>

I am Galahaad Sanguine, leader of Sanguine Crusaders.  Last weekend was just an ugly situation for everyone in the Plane of Fear I think.  <br>
<br>
I realize the plane of fear is a fairly small zone and very easy for 1 guild to clear it solo once you are in.  It also isn't set up very well for multiple guilds to be able to share it.  All spawns are on a 12 hour timer and are located close together.  There also is no ideal places to set up camp and pull to when more than one guild is in there at a time without having half the zone empty.  And at that point, its tough to share the rest of the zone with 2 other guilds and the spawns are all split up so much that there is a couple minutes between the death of one mob and the spawn of the next, it is extremely difficult to share the zone.  It is extremely tough to pull Fear with these circumstances, and I'm sure there were many instances where a mob was pulled past a puller of another guild or even past another guilds camp spot.  These things happen, its tough to avoid this in Fear.  Its just a bad situation for all.<br>
<br>
Now after dealing with this for so long, The Imperial Order respectively left the plane Saturday hoping to return Sunday with a few less people there.  After SC logging in Sunday and seeing the same amount of people there, I contacted both guilds and tried to communicate with them as much as possible and hopefully attempt to share the zone with everyone.  They all seemed to want to do the same and agreed to it.  I had also asked if anyone was using the /shout channel, and after no response, I pointed out that SC would start using it.  Needless to say, after having 2 mobs over an hour time period, we also chose to leave.  <br>
<br>
The only problems I really had with Cicle of Dark Hero's was some of their members chose to acknowlege via /ooc that all spawns were theirs for whatever reason.  I had a problem with this obviously, but especially because I had already spoken to their raid leader and we both agreed to share the spawns best that we could.  The other problem was they chose to make camp close to the middle of the zone and spread their camp area out over a large spot.  I think this is what Rassal is referring to about putting your people over the spawn spots.  Now I understand this is done alot in Fear to pull to, and thats fine, but not when attempting to share the zone with 2 other guilds.  It just makes it literally impossible to get to a mob and then pull it back to our camp at SS *without* going by yours.  So yes, I'm sure alot of pulls were pulled through your camp, tough not to when you are located in the middle of the zone.  However, after so long, CoDH did move to against a wall to make it a little easier, and I think that is when we got one of our 2 pulls.<br>
<br>
All and all, it was an ugly situation for everyone.  I don't know if Fear can actually be shared by more than 2 guilds or not.  It obviously wasn't last weekend.  BTW, thank you Livtinth for posting on Sanguine Crusaders board regarding this thread. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ulivtinth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Livtinth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elite Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(3/6/01 1:31:25 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Got totaly Shafted in PoF....</span><hr size=1> see my answer on your board Galahaad.<br>

<br>
Uhh... I have no idea what happened there and whatever. But I would like to say one thing to this.<br>
<br>
Since I play online games I had this situation several times. People complain if someone uses non-english language. I have even see people being harassed about it and I have seen people being harassed for not speaking good english *Hey fucker, learn to write before you open your motuh*.<br>
<br>
I have seen so many things about this language issue.<br>
This comment shows it very clear again, this attitude I completely do not understand. Since this is a NAG board I will say it the way I would like to:<br>
<br>
IS ENGLISH THE CHOSEN LANGUAGE?<br>
IS YOUR LANGUAGE BETTER THAN OURS?<br>
AM I NOT WORTH AS MUCH AS YOU ARE SINCE I DON'T SPEAK A PERFECT ENGLISH?<br>
<br>
The ONLY reason why english is the most used language in EverQuest is simply because its a US-Game from a US-Company with mostly US-People playing it. But unfortunately (cough) its not JUST US People playing. As I noticed it must be around 50% or even MORE Non-Us-Residents playing it.<br>
So in my view its actually VERY NICE that everyone uses english (mostly) so that we can understand eachother.<br>
<br>
I personally have been attacked for my language (and I use english 90% of my time in EQ). And I have been attacked for not speaking a proper english or sometimes expressing myself not completely clear.<br>
<br>
But when I  get harassed for such things then I just think: I know 4 languages, I speak all 4 language fluently, swiss is my native language, I speak a perfect german, a good english and a good french. And there come there 1-language-only guys and harass me in case I did say ONE WORD that was not in THEIR language... <br>
I think its just... arrogant. <br>
<br>
Would any of you guys learn german or french or whatever, chinese to play a game, to be able to communicate online? I doubt it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok. This has nothing directly to do with the topic, but I found that the comment I quoted was pretty funny ("using european languages to cuss over", lol it sounds so helpless, and after all for sure you have NO idea whether they DID cuss or just speak.).<br>
<br>
Again, I have no idea what happened or who is right or so. I just wanted to add some words to this one comment.<br>
<br>
Love<br>

very good point. exactly my opinion too. while preparing for a kedge raid lately, some friends and i used the /ooc channel to communicate, because it was a two guild-cooperation and therefore could not be handled via guildsay only.<br>
we were still in Dagnor's Cauldron, and yeah, all being german we /ooc'd in german - one (!) other player in the zone did complain about that. then he DEMANDED that we speak english. what we were saying (and it was only a few /oocs) would not even have been interesting for him. i suppose IF we had spoken english he would have complained about us not using tells or whatever.<br>
<br>
so, after he *demanded* that we change the language because HE could not understand it we advised him to learn german, shut up, or simply ignore us. he choose the second one <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/usirtaino.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SirTainO</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Regular Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(3/7/01 4:54:45 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.jollyjokers.com/images/pally.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Got totaly Shafted in PoF....</span><hr size=1> Hmm maybe he also has chosen the third one..<br>

Sometimes this lack of culture in the west leads to some of these rude demands of &quot;speak english&quot;.  I've met some nice germans, swedes, french, and so on....and I've met some real asshole ones too.  It's not the nationality though, it's the individual people.<br>
<br>
Let's just drop these preconceived notions we have about all of these different languages and the people behind them.  Judge them for how they interact or attempt to interact with you.  Take a moment and realize that these Germans and other nationalities are actually making the effort to speak to you in English.  I can hardly say that many of us make the same effort to speak their native tongue in return.  Sooo, let's all just get along <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I've always heard English is a fairly difficult language to learn.  I'm a native english speaker and have no real desire to learn another language.  As long as the one finger salute is universal and I can order a beer I figure I can get along ok pretty much anywhere. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucasidy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Casidy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(3/7/01 10:05:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Got totaly Shafted in PoF....</span><hr size=1> Furtivus....<br>

I completely agree with you, its about the individuals. Oh you have no clue how many german asses I know (*cough*, I can say that; I am not german =)).<br>
<br>
And yeah I know also as many US asses.<br>
<br>
But its not about that. Its about people freaking out as soon as you say one word in "not the proper language in this game". <br>
<br>
I don't care the least what language one speaks and where he is from, hell I even found it very exciting to play wiht some japanese people and told em to go on speaking japanese, since  wanted to read it (and ask myself what the hell it could mean ;)). <br>
We need to find a base to communicate together, so if I join a group i don't just speak german, or french or even swiss. But if I find out that everyone is german in the group (happens often actually), then I stop speaking english.<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh and Futivus.<br>
I found Eglish to be the easiest language of all I know or know a little of (I also know some dutch, italian and spanish). French, or especially swiss and german are WAY harder to learn. But of course english IS a language you gotta learn before you can use it.<br>
