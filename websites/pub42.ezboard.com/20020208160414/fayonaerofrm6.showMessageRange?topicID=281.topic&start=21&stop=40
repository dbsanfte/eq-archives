<br>
People found an early christian church where you see that the egyption god  ressurects Jesus ..<br>
This temple has been preserved and it is one of the first morphs between ancient egyptian believes and christian believes.<br>
<br>
Personally I don't believe in God but I do believe in a higher power.<br>
This higher power is mankind. Since we only use about 10 to 15% of our brain you can imagine what mankind is capable of when we use 100%.<br>
We started as silly ass cave man using probably 1% enough for us to use tools, now we are at 10 to 15 enough for us to destroy this planet. I don't know if evolution can be considdered progress but well I am here and they created EQ so I guess that's a good thing :)<br>
<br>
All in all we also know that some people who use a specific part of their brain (lets say they use 1% of the 85% we don't ) can do stuff we all hold for impossible and still they only use a smart part.<br>
As you say that mankind was created to gods image then it would only be correct to say that mankind are all Gods but we are just not ready to take up that task.<br>
Maybe in 10.000 or more years we will use 20% and are able to do things we now still hold as impossible.<br>
<br>
<br>
Think about it :)<br>

Ytrok.<br>
<br>
There is no GOD!<br>
The biggest problem about religions is that every religion and its followers keep preaching that THEY are right and the REST OF THE WORLD is wrong!<br>
<br>
This is such a BS.<br>
Why in the world should Mohammed not be Jesus? Maybe they just had different names in different languages!?<br>
Why in the world can it not be that an egyptan god resurrected Jesus? For christians it was simply &quot;god&quot;. For other people it was &quot;a god&quot;. <br>
Who told you all that there is just ONE god?<br>
Why does god allow war and pain?<br>
Why does he allow different religions and even MANY WARS based on different religions?<br>
Why does god allow things like the spanish inquisition where hundret of thousands of people got killed becasue of religion?<br>
I thought he is love and the good?<br>
<br>
Why would god want us to go to Church every sunday?<br>
Why in the world is this needed?<br>
I tell you why its needed. Since you go to church every sunday, the priest can tell you whatever he wants. He will controll your religion, your belief, your will the way he wants. <br>
Mostly they are not even aware of it. But there is NO other reason to get  you all every sunday in the church than to make you believe what others (the bible, the ones that are in charge of the church) WANT you to believe!<br>
You can be a great christian by not going there, by speaking your prayers, by believeing in god, or the gods, whatever. BUt tell me why exactly it is needed to go to church?<br>
You sing and you pray. Thats good.<br>
But you also have 90% of the time one guy that keeps telling what is good what is wring, that keeps telling you what you have to believe, that tells you especially WHO is good and WHO is bad.<br>
Who gave him the right to judge? And who says that he is right?! Noone, but you are there, sit there and whatever that guy behind that table with the wine and &quot;cake&quot; says is law!<br>
<br>
Did you know that the Vatican (your center of your religion) is the richest country on earth? Yes its an own country and they are way richer than every swiss bank.<br>
What do they need the money for? What do they do with it?<br>
DO they solve hunger problems in Africa and Asia? Do they invent medicaments and such? Nooo..<br>
They preach that you have to make babies, many. They want you to make more people that believe in them. And They say the comdom and the anti baby pill are BAD - at the same time as they see millions of people die from hunger in Africa because they are too many people.<br>
<br>
The Christian Chruch is not a religion. Its a company! Face it!<br>
The Mafia and the Church work together like Chanter and Paladin but noone sees it.<br>
Cause everyone goes to church, listens to the things they say and thats it.<br>
<br>
Adam and Eva had children and we all are like children of them?<br>
Umm.. if you sleep with your Sister you sure will have insane children because naturally this will make insane children. This is also why its illegal. Sorry I don't know enough english to explain. But you cannot have children with your Sister. They would not be sane. Physically as mental.<br>
<br>
Also we know that there is something like EVOLUTION.<br>
We develope. There was not just GOD that made a man out of sand or so. The whole explenation how the universe was done in the bible, ya know those 7 days and such.. this was just written and said becasue people did NOT Know how this all went.<br>
Noone could explain how the universe and the earth were created. But people wanted answers so they HAD to tell them just.. something.<br>
Here you go.<br>
<br>
Now we know it better, we know how Earth was formed, how the Sun was made and how all animals got on earth. Still people say nooo.. god made that on day 4. /bonk<br>
<br>
Someone said, God was there from the beginning.<br>
Hmm when exactly was the beginning?<br>
What was BEFORE the beginning? <br>
If people kept asking stuff that I ask now 100 years ago, people said &quot;those questions are bad, come from the devil, those questions atre not allowed&quot;. And why? Cause the church cannot answer  them. Cause they are not covered in their way of explaining the world.<br>
<br>
Noone can tell us what was before the BIG BOOM.<br>
I heared some theories but my english os too bad and its very mathematical. So I will not try to get into that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
Now after all those rants..<br>
What do I believe?<br>
<br>
I believe in a holy might.<br>
I believe that there is SOMETHING.<br>
There MUST be something. Sheesh things like WOMEN can't just like &quot;happen by accident&quot;.<br>
Seriously. I believe there is a force, a holy might. But I personally believe even to try to explain this force, to give it a name and such is arrogant. We couldn't understand it.<br>
We don't even understand how our Brain works, we don't even understand what LOVE really IS. We can't even travel to Mars. How in the world can we then EXPLAIN what GOD is!?<br>
<br>
And how the hell can people tell us what god wants!? How can they say we need to go to curch? We need to pray? We need to not eat pig meat? We need to pray toward east? We need get our penis-skin cut?<br>
<br>
I believe in a Force, but as long as this force doesnt tell me personally what she/he wants me to do I will not do anything at all but... LIVE.<br>
<br>
<br>
Most things can be explained with science.<br>
But someone, something made science, made life, made rules, made time.. this force is god. But noone on earth has any clue what &quot;god&quot; is. Especially not the christian church! Trust me, I am catholic I know what I talk about. I been there. Until I realized that this is all BS. <br>
<br>
Now flame me.<br>

<br>
Religion has a good side too.<br>
It give people hope that maybe would be despreate. It gives many people sense where they wouldn't see any. Some priest do actually HELP people. <br>
And it gives a community, people that may be alone find a community. Thats good.<br>
<br>
But thats just a very very small good thing besides all the negative things.<br>
There are so many lies, so much cheating in it. You believe in lies. The pope, the vatican is controlling you and uses you as their servant as they please.<br>
Why the hell does the pope say NO to preventive products that would definately solve MANY problems in the 3rd world countries? Because he needs men to believe in him, cause he needs power. Because he is the boss of a company. Its obviously simply BAD Not to prevent those people that die from hunger to become even more. Still the pope does it.<br>
because its written in the bible. The bible that was written for one thing. To get more people believe in it. By telling many lies. WHO wrote the bible? GOD? No, humans with a goal. <br>
Thats just one example of hundrets.<br>

<br>
Can't explain the world to someone with correct answers... Make up a god for it, or claim 1 almighty being that is alpha and the Omega. Tell everyone that they need Faith so that you are not required to give any proof. Or provide Nikes and Vodka.<br>
<br>
People cannot cope with the fact that they are nothing more than just what they are so... Immortality when you die of course. In a place where you will be warm and comfortable forever. Unless of course you are a sinner, then your immortal soul will will have to be consumed in a firey hell for eternity.<br>
<br>
Hmmmm, and why do all religions start out the same... God(s) talk to one person through some form that only that 1 person can see and hear and never reveals it true self. Hmmmmmm. Can you say charlatan. <br>
<br>
Now which god is it? Christ, Buddah, Zues, Odin, God, Allah....<br>
And for Christ is it... Catholics, Protestants, Mormons, Baptists, Methodists....<br>
For Allah, Shunie or Shehite (spellings could be wrong here)<br>
<br>
Not if there is an Omniscient being, why have 900 other gods running around and only make yourself available to one race or another. Oh yea and there has been more Death in spreading the word of god than another malady known to man kind.<br>
<br>
So while the blind and faithful sheep stay huddled praying in their flocks, remember there are starving children around the world that God seems to think just really dont need food cause remember God has the grand plan for us. Aint Natrual selection a bitch.<br>
<br>
Religion is a great way to keep the uneducated in their place and the money flowing to the altar. Gets those to behaive that normally would not unless you can threaten their immortal soul. Allows people to cling to hope that cannot find hope without the promise of immortality. <br>
<br>
Now on the flip side, if these beliefs make you happy and guide you through this mortal coil, more power to you. <br>
<br>
Anyway just some food for thought. <p><BR> <BR><img src="http://omega.uta.edu/~dak4238/sigs/cuthbert.jpg" border="0">

God gives you free will, its your choice to kill or love your brother.  <br>
<br>
I personally dont even go to church, although I should.  I believe if you follow the bible and believe in Jesus Christ youll go to heaven.  I dont think you need a church or &quot;religion&quot; as man calls it.  I consider myself a christian and nothing else.  Jesus Christ came with a message and died for our sins, historians agree that he came, allot just beliefe he was a phrophet and not the son of god.  God knew that man would forget of his roots and what hes done for us, so he gave us the Bible as something to live our lives by.  Yes men wrote the bible for God, he instructed them to.  Can you name another book thats survived 2000 years?  The bible will be around till the end of time. <br>
<br>
If we went into outer space and ran into a wall or border, what would we think then? <br>
<br>
The pope is nothing more than a Man anointed Man, he speeks of god, but who says he speeks to god and does the things that god wishes to the tee.  Dont be cattle yourself and base everthing on what you see on TV or hear.  God asks us to lead a good life with the bible as your guide, and to accept Jesus Christ as your savior.  He never says you have to go to church and pay money etc.  Jesus Christ himself went into the churches in his time and called the people of the church hipocrites, because lots of men of the church were corrupt.  Thats not to say that all churches were like that and are like that but they are out there.<br>
<br>
If your not a christian and dont believe in the bible please tell us your belief and the basis for it.<br>

<br>
God in every way as he/she/it is described is made by man, no one can dissagree to this and I mean no one.<br>
Everyone that speaks of him speak of what mankind has tought him about god, so don't gimmie the he is there I know it cause the bible says so, cause mankind wrote the bible.<br>
So that's a really fast way of clearing up the question is there a god :)<br>
<br>
Now how do we explain the things we can't explain .. we just shouldn't .. no one on earth can explain everything because we just don't have the knowledge (yet) to grasp the mysteries that take place.<br>
<br>
If we would all accept the tings as they are not only would we be more relaxed human beings but we would really make this world a better place to live in.<br>
<br>
If people could only believe in themselfes they would not have the need for a God, we all and I mean all need a leader because without 1 we would be like ants without our instincts and run left and right without a task.<br>
But this leader should be someone that has only the best in mind for us and doesn't select or judge by color race believes etc, but does so by the achievemnts of the individuals.<br>
<br>
I have to realy agree that God in every form in this world has only created a reason for people to kill eachother.<br>
It has been like this since day 1 and it will always be like this.<br>
The only way to change this is to all stop believeing wich would be wonderfull but way to naief to think this would ever be possible.<br>
<br>
If you really want to believe in something, believe in yourself, accept yourself good and bad, accept who you see when you look in the mirror and you will feel good inside, confident with yourself and will make you a better person all round.<br>
<br>
No I am not a motivation gooroe wannabe.. I just know that if you believe in yourself you can accomplish great things!<br>

It has been changed many times along the way as it suited the needs of the politicians and leaders of the time.  And that doesn't even take into account how many things were taken out accidentally through all its translations from the original writings.  A Catholic bible contains an entire book that is purposely excluded in King James bibles.  Mormons have additional books following the New Testament that were rejected by most Christian organizations.  Muslims consider the Koran the 3rd book, superceding the old and new testament, just as many Christians will tell you the reason things in the old testament are wrong is because the new testament correct them.<br>
<br>
The bible is basically a very long collection of fables.  Aesop used animals and the bible uses parables, but they teach the same thing.  If you don't want people to rape, but you can't convince them with rational thought that there's no reason to in a time when women are considered property, you convince them that committing this act will send them to an eternity of fire and brimstone and endless torture.  You tell them, I could care less if you do it, but this supreme being will fry your ass for all eternity.  When that works, you write it down.  You move on to people who are sick or dying because they live in filth, convince them the big woohoo in the sky doesn't like it and maybe time that revelation with a good electrical storm to prove your point.  They start bathing once a week, it works write it down.  So the story grew.  Along the way they tweaked things.  After a while they decided that sacrificing goats on a regular basis was neither sanitary nor food concious, so they let that one go.  The bit about if your son is lazy and won't work, drag him into the street and stone him to death for all the neighbors to see - that must have got a bit messy after a while because they let that one go too.<br>
<br>
Then they had to fix up the holidays.  They had thousands of people to convert, but it wasn't working out because the so-called pagan holidays (meaning anything non-christian) were more fun.  So, they decided well yeah we know jesus was really born on this day, but those pagans have this big party in December, so lets say he was born December 25th.  We know when he died, but damn, those pagans have another big blast in April taking all our mealtickets, err followers, away, so we'll say he died in the middle of their festival.  We'll move new years to just after Christmas to throw off the timing on all their other events, and eventually we'll have the only reliable schedule around.<br>
<br>
The bible sitting on your nightstand today is a far cry from the original.  I would seriously doubt that anyone, even the vatican in all its supposed wisdom and glory, can trace back to the original parts.  The odds of all that papyrus surviving long enough to be discovered and preserved are just too heavily stacked in favor of decomposition.<br>
<br>
Faith is a mind induced drug.  It alters your perceptions just like alcohol or marijuana will, just in different extremes.  It can be beneficial in moderation, and it can be destructive when it is given total control. <p><img src=http://www.kaseyspace.com/EQ/nenasig5.jpg align=center>

<br>
I don't fully belive in the big bang, I don't belive in God.<br>
<br>
I've always found religion to be a very interesting subject, my biggest intrest as a kid was to simply look and observe churches, yes I was a nutcase, I don't belive why but I was really stunned not only by the architecture but by the fact how so many people could belive in this one thing. Christianity was at the time the "only" religion I knew since that is what most of the few Swedes that are religious are. My whole family is a very long line of "Big bang" belivers, therefor that was what I was raised at, even though my mother did not "stop me in my search for religion". <br>
<br>
The 10 commandments, aren't they really just simple rules of morale? I mean even though I am not a christian I live by them for the simple reason that it's logical and you do not harm your self nor others that way. <br>
<br>
I think alot of ppl need religion to explain certain things and happenings, I don't pitty them for that in a way I think most of us come up with conclusions for things we can not understand just to calm our senses... I mean there's nothing more annoying then actually starting to think in ways like "How can space be unending, it must stop somewhere? and if it stops what's on the other side?" I'm amazed that no religion has come up with a conclusion for that one yet....<br>
<br>
One "religion" that I've thought has been perhaps one of the most clearminded of them all is Wicka *ducks*, I mean the beliver simply choses what he or she belives in, it can be an existing clarified religion such as: Christianity, Islam, Buddism, etc. or simply one of the old mythologies like: Ancient egypts gods, the norse gods... list goes on and cherish that religion in the best way they can, regardless of what "kind" of wicka you are the rest respect you for it, sounds kinda sane doesn't it?<br>
<br>
Most of todays religions are based on the same things, I'd guess that's most since they perhaps once was the same? that simply has changed with the cultures and countries of the belivers?<br>
<br>
I respect religion and see it as something alot of people need for various reasons, but in somecases it can be very distructive I doubt that is because of the religion it self it simply is because of it's belivers that see what they want to see in theire holy writings..<br>
<br>
And I feel like I have to put this in .... accourding to the old bible Eve was not the first woman in the garden of Eden... <p>--------------------- <BR>

The Necronomicon didn't exist prior to HP Lovecraft (yes, really). <br>
<br>
And given that Miyamoto Musashi was born in 1584 AD, I am pretty sure The 5 Rings isn't older than that (actually written in 1645).<br>
<br>
Assuming Korad = Koran, that dates to around the 7th century AD.<br>
<br>
This is not to say there are not books older, just that those are bad examples (the Book of the Dead mention is ~1240 BC for instance).<br>

Nope, not a fancy quote but a damn good one, from Vampire the dark ages the "Cappadocian quote".<br>

Well I belive that we developed out of animals, there has been some doubt about the ape story so I wont fold my self into that line just yet, but that is the logical explanation - animals evolve, humans are a type of animal.<br>

Religion is a good thing.  See, multiple people can do more than individuals.  Institutions which sway multiple people to the same goal are more likely to succeed than individual efforts.  This means religions which encourage their members to be productive citizens and to convert others and to not practice birth control will be more plentiful and successful than organizations which do not promote these things.<br>
<br>
The actual tenants of the religion don't matter, what they convince their members to do does.  Toleration is not necessarily a useful policy to the longevity of a particular religion.<br>
<br>
Neat, eh?<br>
