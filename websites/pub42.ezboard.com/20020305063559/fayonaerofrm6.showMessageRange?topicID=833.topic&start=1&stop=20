Both in game and on this message boards.<br><br>It all started with the RL picture thread, I guess.<br><br>Women posting their pictures, and the reactions from males that see them.  Lots of drooling, vague sexual innuendoes, lots more drooling, some begging, a little more drooling, the janitor comes through with the mop, some begging, comments about stalking, etc.<br><br>Honestly, I cant tell if I want to laugh or cry.<br><br>And once I noticed, I started seeing it in EQ too.  In guildchat, in public channels, in tells, and say, and so on.  Guys practically begging to get some affection from girls.<br><br>And I have to say, I never considered this to be normal.  I didnt get laid a whole lot in high school (I still dont), and I never acted desperate to get women.  But also, I never really TRY to get laid (sticking my dick in something warm isnt my vision of a life fufilling purpose).  I have also seen other EQ based RL picture threads (mainly the much larger Safehouse thread), and there was not this much hounding and drooling over a couple girls.  There was only casual jokes and camraderie, which was normal for the attitude of that message board.<br><br>Personally, what I consider sexy is to be a high level of competence, and a general way someone carries themself.  If you know what you are doing, and are confident in that, it makes you attractive, in my eyes.  I suppose physical attraction helps, in some cases, but not really..<br><br>So I gotta ask other people out there (if you are reading this far), is acting desperate and/or fawning over those of the opposite sex what you consider to be....attractive? <p><HR WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="LEFT"><IMG SRC="http://outside.clanpages.com/podside.jpg" ALIGN="left" HEIGHT=100 WIDTH=100><br><b>Ullric Littleblade</b><br>Assassin of Tides of Valor<br><A HREF="http://www.thesafehouse.org">Ayonae Ro Ring Warden</A><BR>Master of the Jade Hand<BR><i><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=69845">"The more you say, the more I defy you."</A></i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/umoonblader.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Moonblader</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/20/02 6:49:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=833.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Desperation = Sexy?</span><hr size=1> I agree here, Ullric.<br><br>All you folks begging for a &quot;chance&quot; at women that you don't even know obviously don't know how stupid you look.

Three or four of the women there were stalked, and some very nasty accusations of pedophilia started up because one of the guys on the Necro board kept fawning over a girl who looked about 13 in her pic.  As a result they moved the page, password protected it, and added a rule in safehouse, if you even joke about stalking someone you get a warning and if you try it for real you get an instant ban.<br><br>Both ends of this spectrum are amusing though.  At one end, the guys who think fawning over someone in a game like they were watching a stripper on stage will somehow win the heart of the woman to fly out and go down on them (though I've heard of a few out there that will if you agree to pay their rent and EQ subscription in return).  At the other end, the guys who are so dead set convinced that ALL female characters are really guys, and don't dare let down their guard because if it really is a guy, a /hug or /smile emote would obviously make them gay! <p><img src=http://www.kaseyspace.com/EQ/nenasig.jpg align=center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/umikaeliwolfheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mikaeli Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/20/02 8:13:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=833.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Desperation = Sexy?</span><hr size=1> Omg Nena! /drool /cyber /stare <p><img src=http://webpages.charter.net/mikenapr/Mikaelismall.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/unenabierdieb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nena Bierdieb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/20/02 8:40:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=833.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Desperation = Sexy?</span><hr size=1> Sorry Mik, I'm not on the list of women who will fly to your house if you pay my rent... <p><img src=http://www.kaseyspace.com/EQ/nenasig.jpg align=center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucrist0.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crist0</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/20/02 8:51:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=833.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Desperation = Sexy?</span><hr size=1> Well kids are kids, and they don't feel as responsible doing such things over a messageboard.

Main exception is that I don't think there have been all that much bullshit about the RL picture thread as such. Sure, the morons who stalked Logix picked up pace when they saw her pic, but I suspect it's basically the same people who was after her before the pictures came into the picture, and to my knowledge there is noone but Logix who have recieved anything that could even remotely be considered harassing or stalking. <br><br>Also, almost the whole problem with the Logix issue is same as half the problem was with Momento and Ghallunt. The Monkey herd. In those cases, one individual made an ass of herself/himself, and people somehow felt that they had to be asses back. This case is different in that it wasn't Logix herself who started it, but the principle is the same - one or a few starts something stupid, and a bunch of morons tag along. <br><br>As for desperate guys, those have been plentiful in the last century and the one before that. Probably for as long as long as society have been pathriarcial. Blame the anicent jews, and the romans who brought the &quot;new and improved&quot; version of their worldview upon us. Boys are taught that they should not even try to learn to handle their feelings and emotilnal needs, and girls are taught that they should blindly admire and obey the men who have power over them, while despising and shunning all other males.<br><br> <p>Love, Edeina<br>Highelf Arch Mage of Erollisi.<br>Citizen of <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero">Ayonae Ro</a>, member of <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/beternalwrath">Eternal Wrath</a>.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uhalochanter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HaloChanter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Post-o-holic</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/20/02 2:32:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=833.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Desperation = Sexy?</span><hr size=1> I think you guys are using the stalking phrase too freely here.
