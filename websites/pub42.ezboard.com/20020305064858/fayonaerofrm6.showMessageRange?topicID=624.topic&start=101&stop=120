<br>
in another thread about american hollidays you are very quick to show proof that your words in this post means nada..<br>
you say for one that the american way of capitalism is the way to go and i say sure, capitalism leads to more freedom for the ones that can take part in it. but capitalism is a form of egoism..<br>
capitalism effects for all is that many rich buy and sell things to generate money in forms of taxes and producing more jobs. but the capitalist isnt very interested in social welfare but more so about how to make the product in the cheapest way, perhaps thats why Nike shoes and clothes are made by 12yearolds with the say year income as you make for 1 days work..<br>
<br>
humans have set the rules on what is fair and moral but keep in mind that humanity arent american and that most people do not share the thoughts of you.<br>
<br>
you say satanism isnt a religion, well why not?<br>
religion = belief or faith in a higher purpose<br>
then what makes the belief of your god any more valuable then the other ones belief in another?<br>
<br>
we only live one time.. roughly 76years why make those years a constant struggle?<br>
satanist mean that you have those years to spend on things you like and want to do, explore sexual life , aquire wealth etc etc... not much diffrent then the ways of the christian way except that the christian way is to deny everything that you find enjoyable and call it sin and then ask for forgivness which also is absolute so in the end it doesnt even matter (gahh theres that song again)<br>
<br>
you talk alot about love LL.. well then how absolute is your love?<br>
is love of a person the same sex as you as valid as the love of your opposite sex partner? think here.. homosexuality is generaly called a disease by christians and by calling it that they dont have to recognice the love aspect of it.<br>
<br>
how can your love of your wife be more true and valid then the one i have for my wife?<br>
<br>
and in my last post and flexures last post we talk alot about how you only see whats important for you no matter how well we try to explain it ( i tried to let a 10yearold read it and he understood what we ment )<br>
i understand that this is an important issue for you and that all your warning lights go off when you see words like egoism, satanism and manipulation.. but try to understand that most people dont have those narrowminded views and that they understand that the words can have more meanings then what you think.<br>
<br>
reading trough your last post i see you dont belive in hell, demons or satan.. well that must then also mean you dont belive in heaven angels and god.. since acc to your view they are part of the same religion and they are all in the bible.<br>
picking part "a" and excluding part "b" is a smart way to make it easy for yourself isnt it? (and kinda egoistic)<br>
<br>
after reading alot about christianity and american styles of it in perticular (they differ alot) i come across the word "god fearing" alot.. why would you fear a good god?<br>
the god of the Good wouldnt strike fear in his followers and this way of control is the same as hitler and stalin used.. control by fear is working as intended... but fear of what?<br>
belive or else? well thats a sweet one truly a way of life worth emulating.<br>
<br>
you know your homework LL you arent dumb but you are very narrowminded and ignorant, try to understand that the reason for this post is and always was to show that what is good for you dont have to mean the same for the other.<br>
you prove the point in this thread and i feel it was strongly needed to talk about since this kind of conflict is what leads to those religion related wars.<br>
be happy and content with your beliefs but dont mock others because they dont share them... you dont have any more right and we arent any more wrong then you are..<br>
<br>
btw i got an ICQ about what negatron is.. i urge you to look it up on the internet.. but roughly is a atom able to create mass.<br>

Oh cmon give yourself a little credit.  Sure ya are.  Actually since your a Eqoist, your prolly as open minded as they come.  You fuck anyone over in your best interest.   Not sure what opportunity you have to actually check your degree  of predjudice.   Sweden being one of the most Homogenus  nations in the world..   Me?  Oh I live 30 miles outside NYC..  i know Im not predjudice, I deal with people as different from me in every way possible on a daily basis, black, white, puerto rican, middle eastern, oriental, slavic, european, jewish, hari krishna, rastafarian, buddist.<br>
Heres the thing..    I get along with everyone pretty much.  Hell, me and Thorim had a pretty good debate for a few pages and it was always civil, even though we totally disagree'd on everything pretty much.  BUt Thorim is a good person.  Im sure in RL me and him could go out and have a beer and debate and have a good time.   But not you..  you or Halo, or the other Goth Swede, cant debate this without insulting or feeling backed into a corner, I noticed this early.   So i dont hesitate to blast you.  Your a piece of shit.  You deserve it and you deserve worse.<br>

Not stupid, Selfish.  Not just alittle, but completely absorbed in themselves.  Yes..   thats a bad thing<br>
<br>
&lt;not all forms of egoism is bad.. far from it and i promise you that you LL make egoistic things everyday.<br>

hardly.. i think you post replies here because Y O U want too and that you want to contribute to it, and by that you make a egoistic act because it fills a need for Y O U to post here..&gt;<br>
<br>
Egoism is a mental disorder, I think thats the classification, not illness, but disorder.   I post here becuase its fun, and I enjoy debate.  Thats not egoism.  Egoism as I know it to be defined is something like...&quot;Some guy left 20 dollars on a table in back room, there are 20 people here.  I can sneak in and take the 20 dollars and nobody will ever know its me.  I justify this by me wanting something that I can buy with the $20.   My needs take priority over all others&quot;   Thats egoism.<br>
<br>
&lt;in another thread about american hollidays you are very quick to show proof that your words in this post means nada..<br>
you say for one that the american way of capitalism is the way to go and i say sure, capitalism leads to more freedom for the ones that can take part in it. but capitalism is a form of egoism..<br>
capitalism effects for all is that many rich buy and sell things to generate money in forms of taxes and producing more jobs. but the capitalist isnt very interested in social welfare but more so about how to make the product in the cheapest way, perhaps thats why Nike shoes and clothes are made by 12yearolds with the say year income as you make for 1 days work..&gt;<br>
I dont think you understand the definition of Egoism..  Ill try to find a Mental health handbook somewhere at work today and get a definition..  Narcassim may also be a good word for what Im getting at.  If we launch into a debate about the inherant evil of a social welfare state, we could be here all day. again.<br>
<br>
&lt;humans have set the rules on what is fair and moral but keep in mind that humanity arent american and that most people do not share the thoughts of you.&gt;<br>
<br>
Actually they do.  Unless you live in a cave in the mountains, you live in society.  Society has rules and laws, most based on christian belief system, that tie us together and allow us to live the good lives we lead<br>
<br>
&lt;you say satanism isnt a religion, well why not?<br>
religion = belief or faith in a higher purpose<br>
then what makes the belief of your god any more valuable then the other ones belief in another?&gt;<br>
It was stated earlier that Satanism isnt a belief in the Devil, but a philosophy of self interest and manipulation though charisma.   Yes, some ideologies are inherantly immoral, Nazism, Racism, Egoism...  same pile of crap<br>
<br>
&lt;we only live one time.. roughly 76years why make those years a constant struggle?<br>
satanist mean that you have those years to spend on things you like and want to do, explore sexual life , aquire wealth etc etc... not much diffrent then the ways of the christian way except that the christian way is to deny everything that you find enjoyable and call it sin and then ask for forgivness which also is absolute so in the end it doesnt even matter (gahh theres that song again)&gt;<br>
Ive had a great time in my life and done more shit than youll prolly ever do.  Ive explored my sexual life, but never with a friends girlfriend or wife.  Even though in Satanism, that would be perfectly acceptable.  Ill never cheat on my wife, ever.   There was a time where I did every drug I could find in a exploration.   I never hurt anyone in doing it.  A Crack dealer or heroin dealer is a Egoist.<br>
<br>
&lt;you talk alot about love LL.. well then how absolute is your love?<br>
is love of a person the same sex as you as valid as the love of your opposite sex partner? think here.. homosexuality is generaly called a disease by christians and by calling it that they dont have to recognice the love aspect of it.&gt;<br>
I have a few friends who are Gay.  Got no problem with that, just people like the rest of us.<br>
<br>
&lt;how can your love of your wife be more true and valid then the one i have for my wife?&gt;<br>
Depends on your actions<br>
<br>
&lt;and in my last post and flexures last post we talk alot about how you only see whats important for you no matter how well we try to explain it ( i tried to let a 10yearold read it and he understood what we ment )<br>
i understand that this is an important issue for you and that all your warning lights go off when you see words like egoism, satanism and manipulation.. but try to understand that most people dont have those narrowminded views and that they understand that the words can have more meanings then what you think.&gt;<br>
When your wrong your wrong...  no matter how many times you say it<br>
<br>
r&lt;eading trough your last post i see you dont belive in hell, demons or satan.. well that must then also mean you dont belive in heaven angels and god.. since acc to your view they are part of the same religion and they are all in the bible.<br>
picking part &quot;a&quot; and excluding part &quot;b&quot; is a smart way to make it easy for yourself isnt it? (and kinda egoistic)&gt;<br>
<br>
ive posted here alot that I dont believe that the bible is meant to taken literally, Satan in te bible to me is a metaphor.  Ive already posted how my beliefs are in Faith despite loads of unanswered questions.  Read back if you want, or dont, I dont care.  If your Looking for someone with all the answers.. try someone else, that aint me<br>
<br>
&lt;after reading alot about christianity and american styles of it in perticular (they differ alot) i come across the word &quot;god fearing&quot; alot.. why would you fear a good god?<br>
the god of the Good wouldnt strike fear in his followers and this way of control is the same as hitler and stalin used.. control by fear is working as intended... but fear of what?<br>
belive or else? well thats a sweet one truly a way of life worth emulating.&gt;<br>
There are many words in the english language that have double or triple meanings, local colloquialisms..  thats one of them, its a southern termanology.   Fear means belief in that context.  Dont ask me why, its the way the language developed.  Since your not from America, i can give you pass on the nuances of the language<br>
<br>
&lt;you know your homework LL you arent dumb but you are very narrowminded and ignorant, try to understand that the reason for this post is and always was to show that what is good for you dont have to mean the same for the other.<br>

be happy and content with your beliefs but dont mock others because they dont share them... you dont have any more right and we arent any more wrong then you are..&gt;<br>
<br>
To some extent your right, but I feel everything is interrelated, nothing happens in a vacuum.  Ripples in a pond if you will.  To me, Egoism/Satanism is the complete lack of respect for the rights of another person.  Our actions effect people, wether we want to take credit for it or not<br>
<br>
&lt;btw i got an ICQ about what negatron is.. i urge you to look it up on the internet.. but roughly is a atom able to create mass.&gt;<br>
that proves what?  that god didnt create the world in seven days?   I agree.   To me a negatron is just a building block to the universe, a Nail to a house.  The nail still had to be applied for the house to be built.<br>

Let us focus on the 'i dont discount anothers belief as invalid'.<br>
And now go away and read your posts lately. You have brushed off EVERYONE elses beliefs and opinions. You've called us pieces of shit, you've called us morons, that you hate us etc. It's all there. <br>
Now look at the 'I guess each persons faith is a personal matter' - Your damn fucking right it is. But again, READ YOUR OWN POSTS. You're brushing us off. All I'm trying to say here, without you, what was it? 'owning' me, is to open your little mind.<br>
<br>
&quot;based on christian belief system, that tie us together and allow us to live the good lives we lead&quot;<br>
The good lives we lead, eh? /sigh you misguided boy.<br>
I don't lead a good life. I know a lot of people that don't. Hey, get out of america for a week, go ask the world if they lead good lives. Not everyone leads YOUR life, LL. Not everyone thinks the way YOU think, LL. Not everyone thinks Satanism is what YOU think, LL. Not everyone is a goddamn yank, LL.<br>

<br>
<br>
"once again.. follow your own advice and read the post directly above my last one.... where one of you Goth Swedes accused me of equating Satanism with Devils and Hell. It was a response to that point"<br>
<br>
Actually that was Halo, to my knowledge he's english.<br>
<br>
"lol yeah.. thats it.. Nice metaphor. Do you know Yogi Berra" <br>
<br>
Actually no I don't.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
"Oh cmon give yourself a little credit. Sure ya are. Actually since your a Eqoist, your prolly as open minded as they come. You fuck anyone over in your best interest. Not sure what opportunity you have to actually check your degree of predjudice. Sweden being one of the most Homogenus nations in the world.. Me? Oh I live 30 miles outside NYC.. i know Im not predjudice, I deal with people as different from me in every way possible on a daily basis, black, white, puerto rican, middle eastern, oriental, slavic, european, jewish, hari krishna, rastafarian, buddist.<br>
Heres the thing.. I get along with everyone pretty much. Hell, me and Thorim had a pretty good debate for a few pages and it was always civil, even though we totally disagree'd on everything pretty much. BUt Thorim is a good person. Im sure in RL me and him could go out and have a beer and debate and have a good time. But not you.. you or Halo, or the other Goth Swede, cant debate this without insulting or feeling backed into a corner, I noticed this early. So i dont hesitate to blast you. Your a piece of shit. You deserve it and you deserve worse. "<br>
<br>
Oww, hit me where it hurts.. sorry but that wasn't the spot. Ok, because I defend Egoism and Satanism (and all other religions for that matter) I'm a egoist? Cool, nice to know. And because you live in NY and get along with the people there you are openminded? Ok, let's see I live in a very small town in the middle of Sweden about an hour by car away from Stockholm, we are one of the towns in sweden that has the most war refugees from the baltic countries and from the ones America is nuking right now - Afghanistan and the countries surrounding that. I admit there aren't many buddists around these parts so my contact with buddists haven't been to big yet, I'm sure I'll get there too. For example let's take the building me and Itera lives in, the neighbour next door is from Finland. On the bottom floor we have 1 family from pakistan and one from Iran. I admit I haven't had that much contact with the family from Pakistan mostly 'cause they are never home. The family from Iran however I would consider to be good friends of mine, I speak with them daily and know larger part of their entire family (Now that one is BIG). I get along just fine with hundreds of Americans online, I can actually just think of two that I don't get along with. <br>
<br>
So basicly your point is - Because I don't get along with you, don't agree with your narrowminded views - I'm narrowminded? What I'm against in what you say is that you say that all Satanists or Egoists or whatever are BAAAAD, why? have you spent time around anyone that is a satanist for example? One of our best friends is a satanist, my ex is a Jehova's witness. <br>
<br>
Try to see the good in all religions, belive me there is good in ALL religions.<br>

Religion has always been and will always be a way to control the huddled masses. So if you are leader type instead of a sheep and you want to lead, but you just cannot gain control of the catholic church then start lutheranism. Well Luther is still in charge there so I will start Methodist. Well since I am king and the pope wont grant me a divorce from my wife, I will just behead her and start the church of england. Religion is about control and keeping the stupid just that. <br>

BTW Halo Lleauaric is right. In your self centered little &quot;I am better than the rest of you world&quot; you are Truly narrow minded. You only see one side of the issue and I doubt seriously you could make the case for the other side. Try that some time Halo you may find it enlightening. An old debate coach once taught me to be able to make the other sides arguement just as passionate as I would my own before opening my mouth. If you cannot do that then your arguement has no merit.<br>
<br>
BTW... I usually can make your arguements Halo. The problem is you are unable to remain consistent because you do change your conditions to meet your needs.<br>

<br>
Halo, I just replaced my keyboard, making you the easiest person to shop for this Xmas.<br>
Negatron...looks like it's time to delve back into cosmology.  Thanks.<br>
<br>
L2 vs some other folks:<br>
<br>
1) Egoism is not a mental disorder, at least not the last time I checked my DSM-3R (which admittedly has been awhile).  Narcissism is (perhaps was) classed as a personality disorder but isn't what we're speaking of here.  You might view it as socially counterproductive, but that doesn't make it a mental disorder.  Your dictionary definition presented only a building block of a larger belief system (such as satanism or objectivism).<br>
<br>
2) I think there's a need here to define terms, especially what qualifies as &quot;manipulation.&quot;  L2 seems to be using one definition, in which manipulation comprises extreme acts including the betrayal of even one's closest friends and relatives.  Treist et al seem to have a more narrow definition, in which manipulation comprises everday acts familiar to most of us plus others which may or may not extend into L2's range of the definition.  I haven't noticed them deny too much either, though.<br>
<br>
2a) Is there such a thing as true altruism?  Treist and Flex (and my flatmate) would say no, I think, while L2 would probably say yes.  My view is that altruism needs to be redefined.<br>
<br>
3) I think there's plenty of room for debate or discussion of the satanic/egoistic viewpoint without resorting to name calling rants.  L2, your perception of their belief system (which I'm not yet ready to equate to an accurate representation of what believe) may repel you, but I think you owe it to your open mind to ask questions rather than make assumptions and insult.  Such a question might be something like, &quot;Do you believe it is right and &quot;good&quot; to use your spouse/close friend in a way that brings you wealth while decreases theirs?&quot;  <br>
<br>
4) Knowing all kinds off people doesn't make you open-minded.  Accepting them does. (Well, not exactly, but I don't have time to expound so just hope you all get my drift).<br>
<br>
I would have to know much more of Treist/Flex's philosphy(ies) before rendering any kind of judgement.  That judgement would, of course, be based on my own beliefs, not some kind of illusory objective moral standard (ooohhh moral relativism vs objectivism, we haven't gone *there* yet!).  From what I see it isn't a very useful philosophy since it is centered (as I understand it) entirely on the practitioner; my preference is for a belief system that has a positive effect on society at large.  I think I could show that an egoistic belief system is ultimately self defeating rather than self enhancing, but more would have to be known and I'd need more time than I have for it.<br>
<br>
L2, your belief system is best served via calm, rational discussion.  Trust me on this.<br>
<br>
I may be in NYC in March for a weekend; I'll look you up.  Guy walking around with a robe, Staff of the Four, and familiar shouldn't be that hard to find...<br>

<br>
The problem with Satanism though, as I see it, is that there are no limits, no line in the sand one dares not cross, no betrayal or manipulation or transression that is too despicable or underhanded to commit. Basically whatever you can get away with is acceptable, and the strong have every right to exploit or destroy the weak, simply because they can. That much is made crystal clear in Anton LaVay's (sp?) &quot;Satanist Bible&quot; (or was it &quot;Bible of Satanism&quot;...I forget now). L2 has a problem with that sort of, err, philosophy...and I guess I do too kinda, though for some reason it doesn't bother me very much. Also, religion--by most definitions--must have at least some sort of system of morality (i.e. rules that constrain an individual's behavior for the supposed greater good), and Satanism explicitly does not: &quot;Do as thou wilt shall be the whole of the law,&quot; as Aleister Crowely (sp?) put it. Therefore L2 is also correct in saying that to claim &quot;I manipulate and exploit people for selfish gain without a shred of remorse because it's my religion,&quot; is totally bogus, and I don't think he is being particularly close-minded to condemn explicit evil as...well, evil. Although he is a bit foul-mouthed about it hehe... <p>__________<br>

Stymp.   I dont see the difference between Egoism and narcissism.    Look at the definition givin by the people who defined it.  Now Egoism may very well be the root cause of low self esteem.  I dont know..  but Im sure you recognize that a very strong case can be made for Egoism being related closely if not in fact Narcissism<br>

First, since when we are talking about the belief of Egoism, I discounted any other definitions.  Granted, other defitions of egoism are :<br>
     2) Excessive preoccupation with one's own well-being and interests, usually accompanied by an inflated sense of self-importance<br>
     3)Egotism; conceit<br>
<br>
But since we are discussing religion and beliefs, the first definition is the only one that is really applicable :<br>
     1a)The ethical doctrine that morality has its foundations in self-interest. <br>
     1b)The ethical belief that self-interest is the just and proper motive for all human conduct<br>
<br>
In the case of definitions 2 and 3, egoism could be considered a synonym of the first defintion of narcissism:<br>
     1)Excessive love or admiration of oneself. See Synonyms at conceit<br>
<br>
The disorder you spoke of is called Narcissistic Personality Disorder (this is the name given to the disorder in the DSM-IV-TR).  Since I obtained the above defintions from dictionary.com I'll use the same for the disorder:<br>
     2)A psychological condition characterized by self-preoccupation, lack of empathy, and unconscious deficits in self-esteem<br>
<br>
Thats a pretty lousy definition, but so is the one i found in the on-line medical dictionary under Narcissistic Personality Disorder:<br>
     1)An individual with an inflated sense of self-importance<br>
<br>
Your point, as I understood it, was that the philosophy of Egoism and the mental disorder are one and the same so I am going to point out some differences based solely on definition.<br>
<br>
Egoism is the belief that self-interest is the underlying foundation of all morality.  This means that to an Egoist, all actions, whether they appear to be altruisticly motivated or not, are actually driven by your own wants and desires.  So a person who desires to help others may join the Peace Corp and go on to help thousands of people, but he did so only because it was something he *wanted* to do.<br>
<br>
A narcissistic personality focuses completely on itself, and cares little to nothing for the needs or desires for anyone else.<br>
<br>
So a believer of Egoism may help other people and have friends and lovers and truely care for those people.  But they do so believing that those feelings are self-serving.  On the other hand, a narcissist would rarely if ever really care about anyone other than himself because he feels that he is the only person worth such feelings.<br>
<br>
/sigh<br>
Talking about this is bringing back some memories of my work in the hospital.  Narcissists are... well, they're a tough person to care for.<br>
<br>
As for Egoists... well, its not a philosophy I agree with, but they make for some interesting conversationalists, thats for sure.<br>
<br>

I don't remember who it was, but someone made a good arguement about satanism, about there not being a line in the sand.<br>
<br>
I agree, Satanism isn't a religion I myself would chose to follow. Egoism isn't either for that matter, belive it or not those that know me don't consider me to be a egoist.<br>
<br>
I'm simply trying to say that I respect all firm beliefs in a religion, no matter the religion. <br>
<br>
The reason I've been &quot;patting the backs&quot; of satanists and egoists in this thread is that there is no satanist or egoist here to speak up for themselves.<br>
<br>
Most Christians aren't &quot;christians all the way&quot; most satanists aren't satanists all the way either. And to think of it - both are based on each other. Without heaven there is no hell, without hell there is no heaven.<br>
<br>
All religions have a base of good and evil forces. Atleast I have yet to find one that did not include the two. Some religions however tolerate both the good and the evil (Wicca) since they need to be in &quot;harmony&quot; with eachother to function properly, and now I'm starting to sound like a hippy...  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=624.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=624.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=624.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=624.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=624.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a> <b>6</b> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=624.topic&start=121&stop=131>7</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showPrevMessage?topicID=624.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showNextMessage?topicID=624.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=624.topic&index=120><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=624.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.threadControl?topicID=624.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=624.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=624.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Diplomacy Corner<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Administration Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6>NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright 1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
