Granted, Our gm may have been confused.  But his confusion may be because of his lack of investigation skills.  <br>
<br>
From the sound of it, he may have just &quot;seen&quot; the card in Mogur's logs and &quot;assumed&quot; that zehn traded it to him. Well of course he did...thats how Zehn got the card in the first place.<br>

<br>
The fact is, at least from my perspective, he did lie.  Apparently Desilous believed I had the card ever since the end of the discussions on the night of the occurrence, and I'm sure this is where the confusion on his part took place. However, when speaking with Zehn, Desilous said he asked the person who he believed had the card the past 2 or 3 weeks, me, to give it back, and that person refused.  <br>
<br>
I was never asked that, and had never even spoken with him since the night in velketor.  I sent a lengthy email describing the situation and noting his inconsistancies to verant's CS and GM feedback emails pointing this out... <br>
<br>
This evening, about 2 1/2 hours after the email was sent, I get a tell from Desilous, 'Tell Zehn when he logs on that I have something for him.' <p>_____________________________<BR>

I'll be the first to say that Desilous is an ass, but he isn't a liar. he also doesn't try to cover his tracks. If he messed up, he'd admit it.<br>

I thought its was just an automated answering system. Similar to the one you would get on the other end of the line if you called any large company or government bureau, except all the options are dictated to you by a voice that sounds vaguely like a cross between Barney the Purple Dinosaur and Homer from the Simpsons, spoken in an off dialect of Czeck. In the backround, of course, is the elevator music that played in the final scenes of the Blues Brothers. <br>

Well, during my time as an EverQuest players I have gotten myself a lot of new friends, both players that I never met and people that I have first got to know as players and then met them in person. I also have a few friends from other servers and that's what I want to talk about now...<br>
<br>
A friend on Terris Thule who I use to talk to during patchdays or whatever have told me about their former GM, Nangwaya. He was corrupt.<br>
<br>
Reason? Well, first of all. He was a good friend of players in one of the major guilds on the server and therefore he helped them by checking spawns for them quite often. Other than that, he did what Desilous did, but worse. I have been told, you can never know if it's true or not, that he have made up reasons for banning a major part of a guild for exploiting. The guild haven't made much noise about this like Conquest did but at least they got the GM removed from the server. Unfortunately they haven't been given their accounts back, the new GM on the server only say &quot;the past is the past&quot; and do nothing.<br>
<br>
It's sad that things like this happen but it's nothing new, some leaders of certain countries are corrupt, so why not a GM? <p>- Sleik Snejk, Halfling Blackguard<br>

     And to whom ever said about searching logs for thousands of lines of whatever, it take 5 to 10 seconds, tops.  UNless you sit in EC all day long and trade fpor 30 hours it may take 5 minuates, or less.  Desilious is very unprofession in my opinion, but I state, Erollisi marr is worse, you should hear what that gm does/doesnt do.  /pr Just tell them too bad and if they respond again warn them, and if they respond after that at all, escalate it to me and ill deal with them... that was a nice one to see...*sigh* My only point i think is that Desilious is unp[roffesional in his dealing and should take care of the problem in a final way, and explain himself to the person, its only right.

FYI the person that you are refering to was Kelraz, but you misunderstood what he was saying by &quot;getting paid&quot;.<br>
He said $9.89/24/month or something like that. $9.89 is the cost of one month of playing EQ. Guides get to play for free in return for being a guide.<br>

i lost 5  important items in the last 3 years due bugs with no drop items and problems with their sizes and the lack of space in my bags.<br>
i got 4 items back by the most hated lead GMs of solusek ro and ayonae ro.<br>
during the chats with the gms from solusek ro i learned that certain weight reducing bags tend to EAT   items under very rare conditions , especially the evil eye bag, the forager bag and a few other ...<br>
<br>
i just wrote this to illustrate  that there are people outside that received help from the lead-gm . even GMs are only humans and no robots...<br>
<br>
i am sorry for you guys if you loose the cards and you dont get them back ... dont worry its just bits and bytes anyways )))<br>

<br>
For the benefit of Caeanthe (<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), here is another example of my pedantry:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> corrupt</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Rotten; depraved, wicked; influenced by bribery; vitiated by errors or alterations;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I am increasingly perturbed at the poor choice of words that people use, especially when they fail to understand the serious ramifications of their posts. In casually describing Desilious as <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> 'corrupt'</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, you have indulged in defamation of character of a Verant employee. <br>
<br>
You are levelling accusations that infer he [Desilious] is deliberately and willfully acting in a manner to obscure and hide any wrong doing on his part. In other words, a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> deliberate</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and conscious falsification of the facts.<br>
<br>
Desilious may have an erroneous perception of the facts is one thing, but to suggest that he has deliberately falsified his account is another.<br>
<br>
Please <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> think</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> before you cast such serious allegations.<br>

1.) I don't think guides are that useful and bitch alot at them<br>
2.) Desilous has a tough job and screws up alot imo, BUT so far when I talked to him personally I had a good experience.<br>
<br>
I would say Yasp, Mogur and Zehn, just don't fool around with the trade window again.<br>
<br>
Anyway, good luck on getting a blue throne Yasp.<br>

<br>
as to corrupt... in this case it might actually be correct.  Desilious on multiple occasions during all of this contradicted himself and made direct statements that were utterly false.  He could not have investigated this issue and then made those statements without knowing he was not telling the truth.  If he did investigate this matter and make those comments, he deliberately lied about the situation.  And if he didnt investigate the situation but still made the comments, then he still deliberately lied.<br>
