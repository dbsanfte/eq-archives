<br>
Now, some of you out there may be pro communist.  It's a small portion, but I'll admit it may be out there.  So, after stopping the German invasion of Europe and the fucked up morals exhibited by the Germans (and a large portion of non German Europe) we also stopped the Russian invasion of Eastern Europe (you know, Poland, Romania, Ukraine, Yugoslavia....the asshole parts of Europe most of you refuse to admit exist).<br>
<br>
The win in the cold war, was indeed done in part by my generation (although, mainly my parent's generation in such places as Vietnam).  The victory over terrorism will be won by my generation.  Sure, we'll let the rest of the world come play in the sand too, but it will be America that gets the job done.<br>
<br>
I really challenge you to prove the following statement wrong:<br>
America has done one hundred times more for Europe in the last 200 years than Europe has done for America.<br>

 Since we are on WW2, Ill continue on the subject.<br>
<br>
In the 1930s Americans by and large realized we had a pretty good thing over here, we were tired of Europeans and the mess they seemingly continually made of things and wanted no part in the War in Europe.  General feeling was that Neville Chamberlain and the appeasement people had made their bed, let them lie in it, we werent going to send American men to die to fix European mens mistakes.  However, things happened and we got involved.<br>
I recently read a great book by Stephan Ambrose &quot;A Band of Brothers&quot; about specifically a company of the 101st Airborne Easy Company and what they went through.  One of the more interesting things was the way these men related to the people in each country they went in.  It was pretty surprising.  For example, while they Liked the English, they never felt comfortable around them and found them too uptight and stuffy.  The Italians were described as &quot;Lying, cheating, stealing, Wonderful people&quot;.  The American Forces by and large couldnt stand the French, but that was a hard timer for those people and not a fair to judge them.  The people that American forces found themselves liking the most (besides the Dutch, but not many went to Holland) were the German people, a mostly middle class, hardworking people.  <br>
This goes to show, the oddity of what is what at times.<br>
<br>
Now the REAL save of the Europe didnt happen on the Beaches of Normandy or the Siege of Stalingrad.  It happened somewhere in the American Southwest at Los Almos.  Let me explain.<br>
<br>
At the end of the war, the US was still fighting against the Japanese in the Pacific.  And the Japanese intended to defend thier Island to the death, as vigourously as the English would have, maybe even more.  In Fact at the End the 101st Airborne was training for another big jump over japan when the Atomic Bombs were used.   This saved as many European Lives as it did American.  Why?  Well as one US General siad while taking Berlin.  &quot;Its gonna be fun to do this all over again in 6 months&quot;  Meaning the Red Army was thier, Supply lines were set up, Factories were pumping out tanks and the Soviets had Millions of Men to spare, and now the Industy (thanks to Germany) to supply them, Stalin had every intention of waiting till the bulk of the American Army had shipped out to japan then he would have rolled the Tanks til he hit the Atlantic.  But for the use of the Bomb that you people hate so much and rage and rail against.  Its a classic example of being opposed to something that you know NOTHING about. <p>Lleauaric Fyrewynd<br>Sorcerer<br>Knight of Eternal Wrath<br>Ayonae Ro<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3749">Gear</a>

How many of you out there really understand what true freedom is?  One comment that really makes me laugh is what Halo said<br>
<br>
&quot;Now LL, have you brushed your teeth, washed your hands, and pledged allegience to the greatest nation to ever exist?<br>
Because if you don't, you could be facing the death penalty ya know&quot;<br>
<br>
that is the irony of it all..  You can choose not to do any of that and nothing will happen to you.  Hell...you can BURN THE FLAG and nothing will happen to you.  I for one think that every person who lives in the United States and thinks that they can burn the American flag (which is OUR symbol for Freedom) should be shipped out of the country.  Actually I think they should beaten...but i digress.  For whatever it means..I am in the military, and I wear a uniform every day.  I realize that I have one MAIN purpose in my life, and that is to defend the Freedom of the United States.  <br>
<br>
You bash us for acting &quot;cocky&quot; and self-centered...Please spare me your ignorance.  You think that we send our military around and bully other countries and try to force our will upon others.  If that was the case, there would be no England, France or any other country.  After what the German's did in WW2..we could have taken control..but then again..we were compared to the 3rd riech....once again..ignorace.  Ask the Kuwait people how self-centered we are.  <br>
I am not saying we are any better than anyone else, and I also did not like how this thread started, but I will also not sit back and listen to people be-little everything that I fight for.  I am willing to give all that I have for that Freedom and to make sure that people like Lleauaric have the freedom to say whatever and choose his life anyway he wants.  Find someone who lived during WW2 in Europe and ask them what freedom is to them.<br>

<br>
Like I said before, I think that both &quot;Europe/europeans sucks&quot; and &quot;USA/americans suck&quot; are very idiotic positions. Pure kindergarten, my daddy can beat your daddy.<br>
<br>
And mounting a high horse, assuming oneself to be a better person then others and demand a submissive attitude from others, that really sucks. Especially if the foundation of the superiority complex is something as silly as natinality, skin color or gender. Some americans are like that, and so are some europeans. And so are some whites, some blacks, some asians, some men and some women. It's not exactly a new phenomenon. Some americans think they are so cool just because they are americans, and that make them suck. But I don't think anyone here is stupid enough to believe that all or most americans are like that. There have been bullshitty bashing on both sides in this thread, but I don't think people really mean as bad as it sounds.  <p>Love, Edeina<br>
