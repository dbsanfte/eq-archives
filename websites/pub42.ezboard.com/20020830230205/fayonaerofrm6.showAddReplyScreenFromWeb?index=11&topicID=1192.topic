Simple. The parents' goal was not to have a child. The parents' goal was to have a deaf child. I'm not going to get into a big long post about the pros and cons of diagnostic in utero procedures, but it is completely technically possible to test an unborn baby for *genetic* deafness. <br>
<br>
Approximately 1 out of 2000 babies will have a genetic defect causing deafness. If the mpther is going to go to the extreme of dropping these odds to roughly a 50% shot, it makes me wonder if she didn't have the test done to verify if her unborn baby was deaf prior to giving it birth. And when you see the effort she took to ensure that the baby was deaf, this interested reader has to wonder what would have happened (or indeed did happen) had she had normal baby. You can argue what you like about abortion, that's not what I'm doing. What I am saying is, look at the lengths to which people will go to get what they want genetically in their progeny. And frankly, it's a frightening precedent to me. Diagnostic medicine has been presenting these dilemmas to parents of fetuses with various disorders from Down's Syndrome to Fragile X syndrome for a while now, I've just never seen it mentioned for an otherwise normal child.<br>

<br>
Don't get me wrong, if your deaf, blind, mute, ugly, fat, smelly, or anything else, i have nothing against you or any of your friends like that, i just think it's sick to DILIBERATLY cause someone the Suffering of not being able to hear...i once had a blind friend, and he said that being blind was worse than anything else he could imagine...i'm sure deafness isn't much better....<br>

This in and of itself sickens me.  It almost implies that these two could be happier if their son was &quot;more deaf&quot;. I can't stand the thought that they birthed this child to be deaf, and gave the implication that they would've prefered a child who was as deaf as their other child.<br>
<br>
Although the parents, and many others, would vehemently deny my following statements, I feel i must make them.  For some reason, I can't get this idea of &quot;jealousy&quot; out of my head.  As in, if the child, by some twist of fate, had turned out to be not deaf, and could hear fine, that they wouldn't want it anymore.  Much like a female child wasn't as wanted as a male child in the past, and in some places today.  Hell, that could lead to mistreating... But I suppose that's too far off the subject.  Bleh, I've said my piece, as vague and trite as it was. <p><img src="http://members.aol.com/duaicoin/myhomepage/sheep22.jpg" border="0">

<br>
So, they claim that deafness isn't a disability, that other senses becomes hightened instead.<br>
<br>
While it's true that other senses do get heithtened when one go away, I still feel very sceptical about this claim that the pros would come anywhere near outweighing the cons.<br>
<br>
Have you ever experimented with sensory depravition? It can be fun and interesting, but really: It does NOT work like in &quot;Star Wars IV A New Hope&quot;. Not unless you have some dormant superpowers like Luke Skywalker or Thorn. And you don't. The later is one of the main characters of the epic comic &quot;Bone&quot;, in which it's common practice to enhanch supernatural senses by turning off the regular ones. While she believed herself to be just a human, it's quite safe to assume that you infact ARE just a human.<br>
<br>
Pretending that such fantasy is real is bullshit of course, but not mreso then believing in Creationism or conspiracy theories or such I guess. And I can see how it can be a way for bitter people to handle their situation. Just dream themselves away to a world where their disability is actually a advantage. Quite harmless too, until it takes effects like this. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :| --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/indifferent.gif ALT=":|"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
In reality, deafness is to have lost one sense without gaining anything substantial in return. If they had another set of senses then one could argue that they are merely different, and it's almost beside the point which set is most effective. But they really just have the same set of senses minus one.<br>

Not to be too trite about this, but I seem to recall a movie some years ago about a world where almost everyone was telepathic, and only a few speaking people remained (who had no telepathic ability), who were considered 'disabled' and shunned as pariahs.  For those who are profoundly deaf, they are forever cut off from hearing culture in some ways, even if they speak and otherise interact well with the hearing world.  And 'deaf culture' is a real thing.  ASL is not, syntactically or in meaning, identical to English, and because most hearing people don't speak it, folks who use it as their primary form of communication are as likely to stick to their 'own' as immigrant minority communities, where the elder generation does not speak English, have historically been in the US... only the gulf is a bit wider.<br>
<br>
Imagine for a second that you are in the place of these women.  Imaginating how intimidating the prospect of them having a hearing child might have been, knowing that they would be very ill-equipped to teach their son to talk, sing, and share in a wide variety of experiences that are part of parenting, and that he will need, due to their deafness.  On the other hand, they *could* share everything the deaf world had to offer with him....  If they had a hearing child, it would mean in order not to do a great injustice to him, they would have to turn responsibility for a large part of his upbringing to others (granted, parenting is a process of letting go, but they would have to do this very early on), something that, fearing discrimination both as lesbians and as deaf people, they might be very wary of doing.<br>
<br>
While I do have issues with deliberately bringing a 'handicapped' person into the world (and while I recognize deaf culture as valid, deafness is a handicap), I can understand why these women might prefer to raise a deaf child.  I think that adoption might have been a better choice in this instance, however.  <br>

Yeah, that's simple. No huge leap of faith either. These folks are not bashful about telling the world what they did, I can't see them covering up the &quot;abortion issue&quot;. Conspirasy theorists are everywhere!<br>

Being deaf does not make you a defect, somewhat different to others, uneducated, a burden on others, unwanted.<br>
<br>
Your all viewing it from the perspective of a hearing person who doesnt know any difference, and couldnt comprehend the task of living in a silent world which really isnt that bad<br>
<br>
Deaf people are exactly that, people, its most likely one of the least restricting disabilities there is, you can still see, you can taste, you can drive a car, you have motor function, hand eye coordination, you can have good sex <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  you can hold down a job (obviously in some cases it would be hard)<br>
<br>
Deaf parents do not fear (in general) their own children becoming hearing/deaf no more then you would fear your own child to have a disability.. they arent freaks<br>
<br>
If you were pregnant, would you abort because the child would be deaf ? If you did, it'd be out of ignorance most likely. many deaf people lead happy sucessful fulfilling lives.<br>
<br>
What these people are trying to do IS wrong IMO, i dont think any pregnancy should be messed with, it is taking away the childs choice, but thats not to say if the child was born deaf that its a terrible thing.<br>
<br>
Alot of deaf people do have their own mini societys/clubs, these are alot of the ones who havent been taught to interact in society, but more or less its because they feel happier in that atomosphere, im sure you realise communication breakdown is very frustrating (for both sides)<br>
<br>
My GF of 15 months is deaf, completely deaf in one ear, mostly deaf in the other. She was also born deaf, didnt run in the family, just happened. She isnt a burden on society, there are alot of support services for when she needs them (such as say a job interview she can get an interpreter)<br>
She works as a full time chef at a restaurant in town, top of her cooking classes during her courses etc, she isnt stupid by any means, has her own car, is 21 and is on her way in life.<br>
<br>
Majority of them cannot say words properly, this doesnt make them stupid as lot of people think, verbal english is not their lanauage after all, its sign, which she taught me, and now im quite fluent at, and its great watching all you ignorant people out there watching us in shopping centres when we talk about how ugly you are when your thinking, i wonder what they are talking about, poor thing.<br>

Alright junior, dig this.<br>
<br>
You like music?  What about movies? (fuck subtitles).  Do you find comfort in the voice of a loved one?  Would ya kinda like to hear that car horn when it's coming straight at you?   <br>
<br>
Being deaf is a disability.  No one is saying deaf people are stupid, but like it or not, they have it worse than someone who is able to hear.   That's all I see people saying here.  <br>

<br>
I like music, as does she, she can feel the beat at clubs/raves and is more then suffienct for her.<br>
We  goto the reading cinema's all the time, you can fuck subtitles off as you dont need them, she obviosuly does so your logic doesnt work well there. And there is more to a relationship then just a loving voice,she isnt blind, she is still alert to things on the road. ok..junior<br>
<br>
I never said it isnt a disability, but they do not have it worse then people who can hear as a general rule, she has it alot of a hell better then all those on unemployment benefiets that mine an her taxes pay for.<br>
