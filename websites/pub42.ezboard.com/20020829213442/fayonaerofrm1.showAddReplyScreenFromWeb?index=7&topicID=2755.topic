A lot of my game enjoyment is goal/achievement oriented - I enjoy the challenge of having to sometimes figure out a different path to get where I want to go.  <br>
<br>
I know the post 50 game is normally a big change, but I just don't really have the opportunity or inclination to follow that path.  I soloed initially to level faster, then had shifted my goals at one point to become more group oriented.  But I foresee that grouping on a limited (and unpredictable) playing schedule is going to get harder and harder as I go up in levels. Walking into High Keep (for example), joining a group for an hour and then leaving is not a big deal.  Doing the same thing in Sebilis is just not going to work out very often.  So it's back to soloing as much out of necessity as desire. <br>
<br>
Ideally, I would love to find a partner with the same playing schedule as I have;  but even that would probably not work out as I cannot guarantee that I'll be on every day at the same time. <br>
<br>
I'd like to get to 60 but probably never will; I'd like to get as close as I can, at least.   Now, if I did make it, I'd be a fairly useless lvl 60 warrior as far as raiding and equipment go, but I will have enjoyed myself, so I can't really see that it makes a lot of difference.  I'll never see the inside of ToV or a lot of other places, but I'll still have fun.  If I get bored, I'll start another character and go back through the lower levels again in zones that I miss, or places I didn't experience the first time around. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm a casual player because I tend to get bored easily&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm with you on that too.  Even when I have more time available, I've usually about had it after 2 or 3 hours.  If I could ever find out when the Naggy/Vox raids are held, I might make an effort to block out a bigger chunk of time for that, but that's about the only reason I would at this point. <br>
<br>
As to guilds - I was in an 'adult' guild on the server I moved from - everyone had kids and most of us were over 40 (in age).  Guild chat turned into a flirt-fest, which I frankly found to be pretty ludicrous for a bunch of married adults.   And despite the avowed casual nature of the guild, the leadership was still constantly pushing for people to gain levels, trying to recruit certain classes, work on epics, etc.  Maybe it was just a bad experience but it's one which I'm not anxioius to repeat.  <br>
<br>
And, I really don't know at this point whether I'll be playing tomorrow morning or tomorrow night, let alone this Friday at 8:00 p.m.  So I don't want to be in the position of having to commit to planned events.  I've got enough commitments in RL - I play this game to escape all that. <br>
<br>
One of my goals is to continue to be good at my job - a good grouping tank. I fear that I will not be able to keep that up very much longer, but I don't see much way around it.<br>
<br>
I appreciate the replies - I always like to hear how different people approach and play the game.  If any of you ever see me online, feel free to send me a tell.  I'm always up for something different.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uleliucantrips.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Leliu Cantrips</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wanderer</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/9/02 8:18:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2755.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Casual Players</span><hr size=1> im anything but a casual player in that I am online for about 55 hours /week.

Certianly one of the above would have to give if I were spending all 55 hours raiding but EQ to me is all about being social. I hang with girlfriends and spend some entire nights with 4 kills that may have disturbed me while sitting.<br>

I am a 51st level enchantress with 53days of game play time and several smaller alts...<br>

With a full time job, wife, 4 kids (all girls 14, 9, 7, 4) I almost never get a chance to raid or find<br>
time to play longer then 3 hours. Currently we are adding an 800 sq ft. extention to the house<br>
(5 women and one bathroom is NOT [I repeat] NOT ideal) so there is a lot of different RL interruptions<br>
to deal with. For most raids I have to negotiate with wife for time and/or<br>
arrange a babysitter for the kids. <br>
<br>
Casual is ok but I doubt I will ever get the time to see the really high end parts of the game. I just<br>
don't have the RL time to do the Serious Encounter/loot up cycle that would let me go.<br>

There are times I play a lot.  -- this usually occurs about the time my spouse is coaching a sport and is away from home for a good part of the eves.  I have, however, seen some hardcore gamers' lives fall apart around them because of their playing habit.  Is it just a game?  I try to temper my playing time because I don't want to risk losing that which matters the most to me -- my husband, my kids, my family and my Job. <br>
<br>
There are times I play very little.  -- such as now when everyone is home over the summer.  (my spouse is a teacher and I am a school nurse, so we are all home during summer break).  My play times occur during the morning hours when the census on the server is probably at its lowest, and everyone at home is still asleep.   <br>
<br>
I have played the high end game somewhat and have found it extremely vicious, but also enjoyable at times.  <br>
<br>
But when push comes to shove, yes. I am a casual player.  I think I am glad of that. <p><center><img src="http://www.dragonsong.org/graphics/cara.jpg"><p>"The bonds of friendship are forged in laughter, but cemented in tears"</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/umoonbound.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Moonbound</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Journeyman</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/10/02 2:06:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2755.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Casual Players</span><hr size=1> I consider myself a casual player, and my warrior is almost 58.

For the first 2 years I played I was very hard core with well over 200 days played on a combination of my characters. I have 6 real life friends that play EQ also, and depending on the time of year / or burn out they are going through, usually only 4 are playing at any one time consistantly. Its only been lately that we have really got more out of eq than we ever did before. Now if 4 of us are online at the same time and want to do something we can pretty much go anywhere we want as long as its not a guild-raid-zone. I have more fun hunting once a week with these people than I have ever had in EQ. we are all 55-60 and 2 of my friends run double toons, BoT&gt;all. The only thing I hope happens to our little group of marauders is one of us has to break down and buy a 55-60 enchanter so we can go that extra mile we sometimes cant go at the moment. (we would PL a chanter but the thought of PLing an INT toon to 55 sends shivers up all of our backs) <br>
<br>
All of us have retired at one time or other only to come back to the game. Almost all of us where into AD&amp;D and got into the game for that aspect of it, after a while we burnt out because it became more of a 30+ person adventure than the original hopes we had of a 6 man team exploring the great world of Norath. In the old days it was a 30+ situation but now with us all being 60 or close to it, we can revert back to our old mentality of AD&amp;D and truly enjoy a hunt, or dungeon crawl with only 6 of us (2 botted sometimes, other times 6 RL friends) We may not be able to go deep into Akheva, or SSrraa but we have invited an enchanter with us a few times and wandered through plane of growth like it was an adventure, not like it was a grind. We want to hit up PoH sometime with our little 6 man team, and umbral planes, and stuff like that. For us we may only play hard once per week, but we get full enjoyment out of our time while we are there. <br>
<br>
Im in a great guild and I get to do some killer stuff with them, so I kind of live a double life in EQ. I spend most of my time with my guildies doing cool stuff, but that one timer per week that all of my friends and I are on at the same time we really go all out and enjoy a much different game than most people I have met now days in norath play. I wish I could get my RL friends to join my guild, but they really are more casual players than I am, and they enjoy the non guilded life in Norath. One great thing about us playing so many different toons in the past three years between the 6 of us is we have more than 15 level 50+ toons between us, or about an average of 3 50+ toons per person, we can almost always make our own perfect little group, other than none of us ever made a damn chanter over lvl 25.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ugeaenie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Geaenie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local Resident</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/13/02 4:26:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2755.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Casual Players</span><hr size=1> Definitally a casual player for me.

Takes to long to get a group with what little time I get a day and then what time is left is not worth playing. Guildless cuz atm I dont have time for raids.<br>
<br>
I'm hoping that after I get married and my hubby works nights that I will have more EQ time.

I haven't played a single minute, and it's bearing down on me. It all started in my final term of college when I had to finish my final project. It took a lot of hard work and therefore I couldn't play. As soon as I graduated, I was whisked off to Vegas, LA, and Montreal for vacation time (those were the past 2 weeks)...<br>
<br>
Now that I'm back, I need to find a job in the IT industry (yah, right), buff up my resume, and get serious about my life (maybe move out, get a nice car, etc etc).<br>
<br>
It's scary, because here I am, DYING to play EQ, but I'm scared to touch it, because I know that if I go back, I might end up playing too much. I hope that once everything gets settled down, I'll play again...or maybe I'll trickle in for an hour or 2 here or there<br>
<br>
I just have to say that I used to be hardcore and I've quit cold turkey...and the cravings are here to haunt me.<br>
<br>
btw, I miss all those that I've played with dearly. I won't wipe of Bludvipr, but it may be EQ2 time before I can play again. Here's hoping it doesn't take that long.<br>
