<br>
It is possible to make a general statement that the quality of particular posts correlate to a particular age range. However, I am skeptical that an arbitrary range has been chosen thus creating the impression that age is a determinate factor as to the merit of a particular post.<br>
<br>
Don't misunderstand me. I understand your concern vis-a-vis a certain lack of maturity by way of general intelligence, but it would smack of sneering condescension to use age as the sole criterion. There are a multitude of people under 25 who construct intelligent, well thought out posts. And yes, there are also people who do pander to the lowest common demoniator.<br>
<br>
I do not think such an exercise will serve any particular purpose. It will create a feeling of prejudice by those who fall under this age range and are segmented with those who reinforce such an observation.<br>

For instance, imagine you're, lets say....12. Now, if you happen to be reading this post, and you're 12, just pretend you're older than that for the time being, before you start screaming about how I'm picking on 12 year olds.<br>
<br>
When individuals are young, they generally demand attention. I know this, because even though my parents were entirely focused on me, when I was younger, I still had the impression that all their time should be dedicated to their son who was undoubtly going to grow up to become the president/astronaut/doctor/lawyer/curer of cancers. Little did I know that they needed breaks from my constant demands for their attention. <br>
<br>
Eventually, as most of us have, I grew out of this phase of my childhood, and no longer crave attention from everyone. I say &quot;everyone&quot; because I still like to be noticed here and there, and Im far from perfect. <br>
<br>
The age quality isn't representative of stupidity of the individual, because I know people a lot younger than me who are quite insightful and very literate.<br>
<br>
I agree with riotgirl that an arbitrary age such as 25 is rather, inappropriate? Toward those who are younger. What if I were 24 and reading this post? By the time I'm 24, I could have gone through college and be in my 2nd year of medical school, or law school, or anything similar. These individuals are quite distinguished, espically if they rank high amongst their class. <br>
<br>
So yes, generalizing on those under 25 is, improper.<br>
<br>
No, you don't deserve to die Denoine, like some individuals may claim due to their lack of feelings of insignificance while being under the age of 25. Infact, you do make a very good point. Those of lesser age have a particular quality that I've discovered is quite annoying. I'm not implying its everyone under 25, because my Grandfather displayed this quality while he was still alive, and he was 76. Senile? no, not really, just stubborn, but I'll get to that.<br>
<br>
The problem with these individuals is that they must, under every circumstance, be absolutely correct. If they notice someone who doesn't dot their &quot;I&quot;'s and cross their &quot;t&quot;s, they jump all over them like Oprah Winfrey on a honey baked ham. Its not fair to the poster of the original opinion, because it makes them have to defend every letter of every word of every sentence, when they could be doing something more productive, like watching Iron Chef. <br>
<br>
We're all guilty of this, however. Having been to nationals for both Policy and Congress debate 4 years running, I'm used to being nit-picked and cross examined. Out of all of the time in a 2 hour long policy debate round, the 3 minute cross-x is the hardest, not only do you have to defend every syllable that just came out of your mouth, but you have to slander every word of the opposing team when you question them.<br>
<br>
The unfairness, therefore, lies in lack of respect. This may be due to a lack of braincells, or just plain stubborness, but its those individuals who say <br>
<br>
&quot;HEY! You misspelled &quot;their&quot; and said &quot;There&quot;! Youre a facking moron!&quot;<br>
<br>
Those people degrade the quality of this forum. Sure, it's perfectly alright to state your opinions, but at the point when you critique someone's ability to write effective sentence structures, you've gone a wee bit too far.<br>
<br>
Lack of attention and desire to be better than everyone else are the 2 factors that plague these boards. I apologize if I've offended any 12 year olds, any 76 year olds, or anyone who has a disease that makes them crave attention/be stubborn. <br>
<br>
We all have our little mood swings, and these are festive times, meeting family and sharing time with friends. Topics here have gone somewhat down in quality, but, perhaps its a seasonal occurance. Or perhaps that is total bullshit. Flame me on it, see if I care.<br>
<br>
Now, I'm going to crawl back into my cave and continue to make my Kermit the Frog muppet for my mother's elementary school classes. So far I have a wire frame of his head and his torso. Just got back from the store buying felt for the outside.<br>
<br>
And just incase you were wondering, I'm 17. And yes, I live at home, with my mommy and my daddy, whom I love very much. Immature? yes, extremely. Sometimes, however, I become serious for a moment, and think philosophically about things. Recently, that attitude has taken over more frequently, and I hope I can maintain these feelings, because I start pre-med next fall at Emory University. <br>
<br>
Was that a half-assed plug to try and display my maturity by stating the college I will attend?<br>
<br>
Nope, wasn't my intention, but as soon as I wrote it, I knew someone would be childish and scream about it. Some of the individuals I have great respect for either didn't attend college, dropped out, or don't plan on going. That doesn't mean theyre immature, nor does it qualify them for being disrespected. If I was accepted at Harvard and typing this in a Cravat and a Dickie - I still wouldn't demand any more respect/attention.<br>
<br>
Happy Holidays everyone, be safe<br>

<br>
We all know that young people for the most part are immature. It's part of being young. Then there are the old people that never grew up. They are also immature.<br>
<br>
The so called arbitrary age of 25 is usually when people start to see the world a bit differently. They've completed their education, they're living on their own, heck some even realize that there are more important things in life then getting drunk and partying. They've usually even survived one or more personal tragedies, which always change a person.<br>
<br>
Some continue past that age and never grow up. Does it make them bad people? Na<br>
<br>
But it makes them childish.<br>
<br>
What is that old saying?<br>
<br>
When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.<br>
<br>
I always thought that was an interesting quote.<br>
<br>
I'm contemplating a new posting style, one that is more like the style riotgirl uses. It's in a legal type manner that has several qualifiers and quantifiers as not to be disputed in a court of law.<br>
<br>
At any rate, I was interested in the average age of the poster.<br>

Pete Shwetty comes to advertise his Christmas Dishes, from his company &quot;Seasons Eatings&quot; <br>

We do have an 'RL adults only' policy in our little guild, but this is primarily to preserve legal adult talking space in guildchat, etc, rather to exclude anyone based on their presumptive maturity, which we check out well *before* tendering an invite <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  In fact, early on, we had a case where an 'adult' (&gt; 30) member of our guild invited someone into the guild who was sixteen.  The guy was great, and probably would have been a good fit in the guild, but we had decided as a guild at our inception that this we would remain adults only.  So we asked the member who invited him to please explain the situation and apologize to him.  What ensued was very interesting.  The member (who *was* a founding member, and had agreed to the age limit in our charter), first refused, and then tried to strongarm the rest of the guild into allowing the minor to stay in the guild.  The minor, on the other hand, was completely cool and took the situation in stride, even though it ended up as an embarassing mess over guildchat...<br>
<br>
So it just goes to show you that age does *not* always correlate with maturity, although we have also found that younger players don't usually like to play at the erm, sedate pace that we folks with kids and jobs do and would usually be happier elsewhere anyway...<br>
<br>
Denoine, it's been mentioned, but there is a 'RL age thread' in the General section (I started it after seeing all the smooth-faced folks in the RL pictures thread <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  Nearly 90 people have posted at my last look, if you want to satisy your curiosity... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I am old therefore I cannot be construed as immature. Age has nothing to do with maturity, although in most cases there appears to be a direct correlation. Also Intelligence and maturity do not necessarily go hand in hand either, but once again there appears to be a direct correlation in most cases here as well. <br>
<br>
Besides, this is a nag board, a place where people who really dont know each other can come to explode, vent, perform as self serving psuedo intellectuals, try to impress, try to dazzle, try to be insightful as well as incitfule, the list goes on. Although I would guess most are really acting as themselves. Oh well, I post therefore I am. Have a nice day.<br>

To break it down into two simple sentences and take away the fluff of the few paragraphs already written....  I think anyone under the age of 25 is not able to post meaningful topics or has inferior juvenile replys to said topics.  I am 31 though so that automatically garauntees my intellectually superior posting strategies and all others over 31 supply the bulk of interesting commentary on this forum.<br>
<br>
   I know this may sound a little too harsh, but after years of age discrimination in this game it gets really old.  Im a few months away from 21 years old.  I was living on my own since i was 17 and out of high school. I don't drink, pay all my bills on time, and am not a felon.  This may break all the stereotypes that you've set in stone in your head.  What in my life and posting has made me some intellectually inferior or slanderous more so than you or anyone else over the age of 25.  This post is getting a little on the offensive side here i realize, but not anymore than your original topic was.  My group of friends range from 18-35, and they are all for the most part equally mature in their actions and words.  What you said would be like me saying &quot; anyone 30+ here must be the ones responsable for all the senior citizen style,decrepid, bland posts that have no zest or actual point in them because the poster is soo &quot;old&quot; they cant remember what they were originally typing by the time they got to the second paragraph.&quot;  <br>
<br>
  I just wish more people would think about what they say when they are biased against people because of their age when they havent even uttered a word to them.  Age discrimination is just as much as a crime against society as any ther form of discrimination.  It makes people feel looked down upon and really does not help peoples confidence ecspecially when the person saying it is someone that they frequantly see/talk to (meaning posts on this board).  What do you think a &quot;kid&quot; is gonig to do when he wants to post something but he doesnt say what he feels or what he originally intended to because someone might think his posts are &quot;childish&quot;, &quot;immature&quot;, and not worthy of your 31 y/o eyes.  I don;t know you too well, so maybe you didnt mean exactly what you said in your original post(s).  <br>
<br>
It just irks me everytime I see someone saying all people in said category (teenagers/chinease/woman/etc.) are below you because if something is not to your liking it &quot;MUST&quot; be someone who is &lt;25 or what not.  It is like someone saying a poster on here says he is from ny city, he cant spell too well and someone saying it's because he is black or latino.  Your putting down a large portion of players and fellow community members by saying what you did.  Again, sorry if this seems too harsh and I'll gladly wait and see you maybe explain yourself a little better and make that generalization a little more precise.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uafierra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Afierra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/1/02 8:17:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=768.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://endor.cybrzn.com/ozbeaner/scare1099d.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lack of Maturity or just newbie?</span><hr size=1> I think out what I say, and its still retarded - I guess that's what 19 year olds do.<br>

I would go more in depth about the misconceptions about pre-teen to teenager era but I gotta get ready for work.  Immaturity is kinda what some people strive for.  Its like a game - have fun and in their eyes maybe its to make people laugh.  A feeling of acceptance if you will.  Sure there is a general population that would not accept this behavior, but if a few get a giggle, maybe these immature people fit right in.  <br>
<br>
Just like in real life.  You got black ties, white collar folks, and then some 14 year old and a fire cracker, trying to get a frog to swallow it.  Who cares - live and let live. <p><p align=center><strong><Font Size="4" color="red">Afierra Lonecaster</font><br>

Maturity is not based on age in a lot of cases. Also, I never demanded my parents attention when I was 12 to tell them about how I wanted to be an astronaut. But perhaps that is just me. <br>
<br>
I have seen many youg players and many act far more mature than me, which I suppose isn't hard when I am running around engaging in sexual positions and saying such phrases as &quot;Gibb0r me sex0r fuxing n00b!&quot; I suppose this is becuase I am two years old. But maturity has nothing to do with the sence you make, or the make you sence.<br>
