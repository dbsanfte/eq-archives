Was that not the basis this country was founded on?<br>
<br>
Coming from Colombian/Honduran backround, it pains me when (and i'm not rascist, i love every race/color/creed) european-american white people talk about &quot;their&quot; country. In actuality, who's been here longer? <br>
<br>
I don't like to get political, much less on a NAG thread, but who's the &quot;fucking foreigners&quot; here? How dare you call latin americans &quot;fucking foreigners&quot; or any American that helped build this land, for that matter. What do you call the natives that were here before you? Aliens? This country was pretty much built on african/native labor and you have the nerve to call this your country? Who took over who's country?<br>
<br>
Maybe those dudes you saw talking about how bad this country is were as simple minded as you are, but do you even consider the fact that they're here because their parents either brought 'em here or birthed them here for a better life?<br>
<br>
Look man, there's no greater country than the U.S. of muthafuckn A. Land of the the free and i feel that in my heart of hearts! Yes, like all households, we all have our internal problems in the household. You talk about &quot;fucking foreigners&quot;, what about those protesting against OUR prisoners in Cuba from Afghan backround? Those are YOUR people protesting the treatment of Terrorists. <br>
<br>
You're from S. Florida, i'm from New York City, born and raised. I looked out my window and witnessed in agony and despair two of MY city's monuments go down. Many of my people, your people, and most of all, everyones people (Americans) fall victim to a heinous act of violence and terrorism. I cried in anger and fear, as did all americans.<br>
<br>
I worked in downtown Manhattan and thankfully did not have to work that day.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, i know you in-game and personally, i think you're a cool person, but you struck a nerve when you decided to basically call my mother and father, who came here to seek prosperity and success, &quot;fucking foreigners&quot;. <br>
<br>
In my eyes, you're the foreigner, because i have every right here. <br>
<br>
Sorry for my ramble, man. I love everyone, and i solemnly hope one day, all races will come together as the humans that we are. <p><img src="http://www.parceroassassin.8m.net/images/human_assassin.jpg" border="0">

<br>
So you mean that Americans doesnt fabricate a single lie or missview of the muslims??<br>
I still remember the pictures if happy muslims after the 11/9 and how it was later revealed that they was paid to look happy and had NO idea of what had happened (by US media), isnt that a sort of lie to raise the hate? I dont compare this to nazi-german as what Hitler did is far worse, but the US uses some strategies that are based on the same ways, they fake information to get the people to accept what they are doing, boming "military targets" and "accidentally" kill a LOT of innocents, you would get afraid if you knew how many of those innocents that was calculated to die.<br>
<br>
Im not promuslim and Im not proamerican, Im just a disbeliever in the way USA acts and how they sticks their fingers in EVERYWHERE, even if they have NOTHING there to do and that their presence just tightens the conflicts and makes it harder to resolve, or just bombing cos they can to make em look better and more powerful then others. US politics are deemed to get terrorists to target USA as it builds on interfering with business that they know nothing about...<br>

<br>
In a word. Bullshit.<br>
<br>
One (1) news agency began this FALSE story that the celebrants were paid by American media to celebrate in that video clip..."Sabawoon" – A self-described “Muslim News Agency”.<br>
<br>
This was about a week after the same news agency claimed the video was from over a year before September 11th - and were proved wrong.<br>
<br>
"Sabawoon" was then proven wrong on this bullshit story that the celebrants were paid - when independent witnesses verified that celebrations were in fact going on in the street that day, and one of the witnesses (a French government official) recalled talking with the videographer at the location of the video.<br>
<br>
Even Sabawoon has now backed away from this bullshit story - removing all traces of it from their websites.<br>
<br>
Congratulations - you are a victim of propaganda.<br>

&quot;Im not promuslim and Im not proamerican, Im just a disbeliever in the way USA acts and how they sticks their fingers in EVERYWHERE, even if they have NOTHING there to do and that their presence just tightens the conflicts and makes it harder to resolve, or just bombing cos they can to make em look better and more powerful then others. US politics are deemed to get terrorists to target USA as it builds on interfering with business that they know nothing about...<br>
&quot;<br>
<br>
You certainly have the right to disagree with US policies. I would point out a few things I disagree with in your statement. You are basically stating that we go around the world bombing folks anywhere there is any sort of conflict, even if we have no conceivable interest there because we like to. Can you give me an example? <br>
<br>
<br>
Iraq? Please, they were threatening the world economy of which we are a part by seizing the oil fields of Kuwait and about to do the same from Saudi Arabia. Given our support of Israel they would have cut off supplies of oil to us and our allies to pressure us into abandoning Israel.<br>
<br>
Panama? Again, the threat against the Panama Canal posed by a military dictator under the control of drug cartels is definitely of interest to us. <br>
<br>
Bosnia and Kosovo? Well, we tried to stay out of that one as long as we could until the Europeans whined so much we had to come in and clean up the mess for them before the fighting spilled over into neighboring countries.<br>
<br>
Libya? Well, that was paybacks for the Libyan secret service assassinating US servicemen in Germany. Convincing someone that killing our people is a bad idea is definitely in our interest.<br>
<br>
In all of those places we have a valid interest. Now lets look at places where we have NOT interferred and would have if your opinion was correct:<br>
<br>
Sri Lanka- An ongoing civil war<br>
<br>
Rwanda- Intertribal warfare spilling over into several countries and killing hundreds of thousands of people.<br>
<br>
Chad- Libya sent in armored forces to try and extend their influence by supporting the islamist side in a civil war. We did nothing (though France intervened and gave the Libyans a bloody nose).<br>
<br>
Algeria- Ongoing fighting between the government and islamists.<br>
<br>
Falklands/Malvinas- We tried diplomacy to resolve the issue between two allies but when that failed we did not engage with force.<br>
<br>
Chechnya- Russia has been fighting seperatists there for years. We criticized their methods but have in  no way used any force.<br>
<br>
Timor- We stayed out of that one. The Australians cleaned up that mess.<br>
<br>
Spice Islands- Ongoing attempts to exterminate the christians  there by imported islamic vigilantes from other parts of Indonesia. We have not been involved.<br>
<br>
Angola- A long running civil war. Hmmm, we seemed to have missed bombing that place. Actually much of sub Saharan Africa has been in turmoil with no US military involvment.<br>
<br>
As far as our involvement in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict stiffening the conflict, I would ask you how so? Because we will not force Israel into suicide? Do you have any clue what the Palestinians would do to the jews there if they are allowed to overrun the country (a desire they have plainly stated since Israel was created)? Bush was heavily criticized by taking a hands off attitude when he took office, especially by pro Palestinian Europeans. Make up your minds! We piss you off because we get involved, then we piss you off because we stay out of things. Sounds like you have other issues.<br>

Simple: they just let their racism, prejudice, and hatred control their thoughts - and surrender all reason, knowledge, and truth.<br>

Unfortunately - given that their piss-poor educations left them with no facts, knowledge of current events or history, or even them most basic common sense - what options are left to them?<br>

This would entail them taking some completely unprecedented actions, such as:<br>
<br>
<b>1. Reading a book from the non-fiction section of their library.</b><br>
   This is absolutely impossible as they are still struggling through that Ann Rice book they started over a year ago.<br>
<br>
<b>2. Reading a newspaper.</b><br>
   And by a newspaper I do not count the pamphleted propaganda given to them by the hairy-legged Wiccan women, or the sandaled and goateed Che Guevara clones, that loiter about in front of their local New Age crystal and black-light poster store.<br>
<br>
<b>3. Listening to what people who know more than them have to say on the matter.</b><br>
   And no - Sinead O’Connor and Bono don't count..………..for anything.<br>

<br>
So out of the ENTIRE history of the United States, the closest thing you can come to a &quot;terrorist attack&quot; is a non-lethal assault on two people by a mob that happened over 200 years ago. And because of that one thing, you feel that the Taliban is now justified in killing 3000 people. You are a sick fool.<br>
<br>
According to you, moral transgressions are carried over for all eternity from one generation to the next (why else bring up the Boston Tea Party, unless you somehow think we were all alive at that time). According to you, no one has a right to defend themselves unless all of their ancestors were morally perfect in every way (which yours must have been since you state that YOU have the moral right to defend yourself personally with lethal force). Can you truly not see how fucking stupid that is?<br>
<br>
But that is all irrelevant anyhow as I said before. History has nothing to do with this. This situation does NOT exist because of some bullshit that happened 200 years ago. The Taliban kills because it is their religion to kill. They have no need for any historical reasons...and indeed have probably never even HEARD of the damn Boston Tea Party. <br>
<br>
There is nothing, absolutely nothing, that we can do to placate or appease them now (aside from us all becoming Muslims). And there is nothing, absolutely nothing, that we could have done differently in history to placate or appease them (aside from us all becoming Muslims). Thus you cannot lay the blame for this at America's feet. America is 100% blameless for the Taliban's actions--how can we be blamed if there is nothing that we could have done different? <p>__________<br>

I have never tried to support or justify acts of terrorism.  I have never actually stated that America should not go over there and make a world class parking lot.  In fact, had you read through my post, I'm pro-U.S. action, however, I do not deny OUR history.  The boston tea party was ONE example of attacking innocent people to prove a point.  To my understanding, that seems to be a common view of what terrorism is.  Almost everything about the American Revolution was seen as terrorism, because we didn't fight by England's rules.<br>
<br>
Now, today, when the same thing happens, and roles are reversed it's somehow not right and the others should be punished.  So, according to your logic...in approximately 60 years, when anyone involved in the WTC attack has passed on.  It will no longer matter.  What if we haven't stopped the threat of terrorism by then?  Are we supposed to stop and say &quot;well, history doesn't matter!&quot;<br>
<br>
You are correct, this has nothing to do with events of 200 years ago, it predates that by some time.  Last time I checked, this war has been going on for at least 500 years, and I think even longer, does somone have a better timeframe?  However, I disagree with you on one fact.  We can lay blame on the U.S. 100% for the 9/11 attacks.  We chose to ally with Israel, in doing so, we joing the opposition to these people.  Had we never sided with Israel, this event more than likely wouldn't have occured.  Sure, their religion states to convert the non-believers, or kill them.  However, I see a lot of non-believers between Israel and the U.S. and without provocation I'd wager they'd take a while to reach us, if ever.<br>
<br>
Now, since some people are too stupid to understand, I AM NOT SAYING ANYONE DESERVED THIS ATTACK.  I know, hard to believe a Taliban bed-buddy such as myself would say such a thing...  TERRORISM IS NOT JUSTIFIED, THE ATTACK IS WRONG, NO ONE DESERVES TERRORISM, IF YOU DON'T GET MY POINT YET, YOU ARE FUCKING STUPID.<br>
<br>
So, if you still think I support terrorism, by merely pointing out empirical evidence that the U.S. is not the angelic poster-child of perfection that we all like to claim it is, then please kill yourself.<br>

<br>
Dont ever try to get an american to realise that what he/she knows is wrong cos they cant be wrong, as their fathers/brothers/president/medias/and so on have said it and then its true. Im pretty amazed by how much you ppls can defend your own actions but shoot down so hard on others for doing the same. <br>
Like in the Iraq war, 400k+ womens and childrens died, thats a huge number for accidental hits, isnt it? (the number is set by both Nato, UN and Haag) And thats nothing cos they deserved it, plain and simple (by american views...) But when someone from there kills 1 or 2 americans then whole US gets fired up and starts to prepare for a war, isnt that wrong? Think for yourself once and try to forget what you have been told by them being evil and how they react to what US does, I dont understand that the US government still has the power to "manipulate" a whole country, very much like nazi-german, minus the semitism thou.<br>
I wonder how long there is before the US peoples realise that its time to open the eyes and care not only about themselves... <p><center><img src = "http://hawkmail.monmouth.edu/~posten/new/tzadsign.gif"></center>
