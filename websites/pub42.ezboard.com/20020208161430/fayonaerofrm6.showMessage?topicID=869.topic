Going to post it by person....<br><br><br>Beetar: Beetar was played by 3 people, due to my little respect i still have for them i will not post their true names. Two people primarily played him, but their was a 3rd friend who sometimes played him. This was the person who did all the scams..... He auctioned items online for RL cash and gave the people a mailing adress that did not give him away, but he still got the cash. He today is known for his famous nazi post on all the boards, some people will know him as Xalion.<br><br>Zerbrista: The person we all have grown to love,,,,, She was a member of a guild called Free Reign , One day she decided to become &quot;loot master&quot; for the day in WW. Well I know for sure that she looted at least ONE dragon head used for frostbringer quest and at least one pair of arms and boots. The next day, she wasnt in the guild. On another note, her druid anewal. She decided to come join a group of Free Reign ( with out FR knowing) and gave tunare a little tap and encouraged the rest of the zone to agro on our group.<br><br>Aelani: The cleric that seems to be the hot topic recently. I was on the phone just last weekend with a Azure Dream member and he read that a thurg plate bp was looted by Aelani, AD was not raiding kael atm. Not 5 minutes later , A member of FD said that a group of theirs was taken out and plate breastplate drop, all died before it coule be looted. She told AD that no one was around at the time. My friend mentioned that fact to her and she threated him.<br><br>Bloodleaf: Bloodleaf , i had no personall quarrel with him, but he messed w/ my RL friend, he &quot;borrowed&quot; a frostbringer and just decided to not give it back. Bloodleaf was later removed from our server due to a comment on terrorism. He now plays a ebayed character. =)<br><br>Can't think of anyone else right now, besides blaren that lvl 20 mage who stole my FBR on CT server about 3 years ago.<br><br>Some people think that people who post anon dont have the &quot;balls&quot; to post. I have been reading this board for a long time now and I've never really wanted to tell anyone about these things, i guess you could say that im one of those guys that lets himself get walked all over on. <br><br>To some, this post has no meaning what so ever. My goal for this post was to warn people of these players so they do not have to experience the crap i had to put up with.<br><br>Maybe with this post, others will post their problems. Nothing minor, just think that we should all know about these scammers that are runing around corrupting our Server...<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=riotgirl>riotgirl</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elite Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(2/1/02 2:28:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=869.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re: Things we all should know</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Some people think that people who post anon dont have the &quot;balls&quot; to post.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>I being one of the most fervent of them.
