It is also a very slow skill to raise. You need to have been using a shield religiously since the low levels to get Bash to 240, since the recycle time between bashes is permanently set just like taunt. Other weapons related skills can be raised faster by using low delay weapons, since a skill point increase is based on number of attempts over time. Every swing of a weapon is an attempt and the lower the delay, the more attempts.<br>
<br>
On large targets that can gate or if you have an enchanter with you, your best bet is to have them seive. A full raid party of 20 melee kicking, slamming and bashing can still allow a CH or a Gate to take place. Trading damage output for a few more random chances at stunning a mob is not worth it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ukleg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kleg</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/24/02 6:53:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=825.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~cazic/cazic/ubb/uploads/Kleg.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;it's not my job to bash&quot;</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You could have 20 warriors with max bash skill bashing a mob like crazy and it might interrupt a CH once in 20 tries, if you are lucky.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

You apparently don't have your skill maxed in bashing.  I've interrupted CH and gate plenty of times to be convinced of its usefulness.  With decent haste, I get 2 chances to interrupt gate and 3 to interrupt CH.  I likes them odds.<br>

<br>
I'm a 58 SK and I make it my prime duty to stun caster mobs when I'm in a group (with melee secondary and casting tertiary) as it prevents unnecessary complete heals, nukes and other irritating spells that mobs cast to throw you off.<br>
<br>
The best example of this that i can pull off the top of my head is the upper kobolds in Velks, if you're fighting a champion and a priest pops near you and begins healing, if that champion is almost dead the priest will damn near ALWAYS CH the damned thing just as it's about to die, making your job over 100 percent longer and harder than it has to be.<br>
<br>
If I see that priest pop and realise it's casting i dive forward and bash the crap out of it until the champion is dead.<br>
<br>
Sure a cleric/pally/etc can always stun, but more often than not their attention is elsewhere (healing, tanking etc) and it's not always possible to switch targets rapidly.<br>
<br>
The moral of this baffling rant is: &quot;If you've got bash/slam/kick and it stuns the mobs, USE IT&quot;<br>

<br>
Being new to the warrior game myself with a vah shir I have leveling up they don't get inate slam either which is b/s imho.  If you're too big to get in FV buildings I think you should get slam but that's neither here nor there.<br>
<br>
Swapping a shield in and out... I don't play with my inventory screen up all the time.  I can't have a shield constantly sitting on my cursor either.  So, what's the best way to switch that shield in and out without constantly having to bring up my inventory nor have it always sitting on my cursor?<br>
<br>
On the bash discussion though...<br>
<br>
You shouldn't be pulling mobs so far away that gating is a problem in the first place.  If you're pulling mobs from so far away that mobs are respawning again in between where you pulled it from and where you are then you are over pulling or not moving closer to where you really need to be.  Yes, gating wanderers are a bitch and I agree they are the rare exception.  But there are still more options than ghetto bashing available.<br>
<br>
On a CH issue... you either seive the hell out of it or those wizards need to be saving mana to nuke it to oblivion once it gets to CH or Gate stage.  Some form of lure is going to work on it and it's a hell of a lot more reliable than ghetto bashing.  It's the wizard's job to know when that is (yes, you wizards do need to pay a little more attention than just button pressing.)  If you have no other options beyond ghetto bashing a mob you, as a guild, didn't come prepared for the encounter to begin with and the blame is not entirely on the warriors.  Most guilds do have a lead tank and the rest &quot;should&quot; carry shields with them just for that one time in their entire EQ career where it was absolutely needed.  However, I have yet to see a warrior ever put on a shield nor have I ever seen a situation where there wasn't another and better option available.<br>
<br>
&quot;And for those who don't know, if a mob's casting can be interrupted via stun, a landed bash will ALWAYS interrupt it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, however, the issue here is mobs that aren't stunnable which started this discussion.  If the mob is stunnable then stun the damn thing to begin with rather than resort to ghetto bashing and losing any amount of dps no matter how small the loss might be.<br>

<br>
<br>
For those warrior types who don't have the slam skill, here is an effective method for disrupting those pesky spell casting mobs.  I call it slash and bash, but there are those who call it......Tim?<br>
<br>
You'll need to be duel-wielding to pull this off.  It can be done with a 2H weapon, but it's more difficult.  Besides, duel wielding against casters is always a good thing.   Oh, and because kick and bash are mutually exclusive, you shouldn't be kicking at all while using this tactic.<br>
<br>
First of all, you'll need to set up your hotkey slots so that at a minimum, you have the bash skill and your offhand weapon slot present (see picture below for more detail).  To get the offhand weapon slot into the hotkey slots, simply hit 'i' to bring up the inventory window and click and drag the weapon slot to an open hotkey slot.<br>
<br>
When attacking a caster mob, get your shield out and hold it on your mouse cursor.  Now the tricky part.  Watch for the the spell casting message &quot;Bignastymob_05 begins to cast a spell&quot;.  When you see that, click on the offhand weapon slot, which will cause you to equip your shield (your weapon will appear on your mouse cursor).  Immediately press the number of the bash button.  Finally, reclick in the offhand slot to reequip your weapon and place the shield back on the mouse.<br>
By doing so, you usually will not miss a round of battle with your offhand, and you get a chance of interrupting a spell.<br>
I keep the mouse hovered over the weapon slot so it only takes a fraction of a second to complete the sequence.  My bash button is number 4, so the sequence is click-4-click.<br>
<br>
Couple of other tips.<br>
<br>
1)  Keep an open inventory slot for your shield and drag that slot to the hotkey slots as well.  This makes it easier to equip when that caster mob is pulled back to camp.  You don't have to go fishing around your backpacks for it.  This isn't shown in the screenshot below.<br>
<br>
2)  Change the text color of the mobs spell casting message to something which gets your attention.  Makes it easy to see amidst the spam.  Sorry, I don't have the specific number within eqclient.ini to change.<br>
<br>
3)  When you get really good, you can delay bashing until the mob is almost done casting the spell.  Remember, while a mob is casting, it isn't attacking.  So, bashing later can be helpful, but probably not enough to worry about.  What I do watch for is other interrupters.  Alot of times, a mob will begin casting another spell right after the first one is interrupted.  Usually, the bash skill has not reset by that time.  If there are other bashers or stunners present, I'll wait a second to see if the spell gets interrupted by someone else first.  If so, I save the bash for the next spell.<br>
<br>
You have been practicing your bash skill, right?<br>
<br>
Here are the screenshots.  I really should update them.  I think those weapons are the uber runed falcion and the ominous sharkjaw cutlass.<br>

I link some keys so when ya hit like &quot;1&quot; it activates 2-3 other hot keys as well at the same time.  For example, when I press &quot;1&quot; to taunt it also activates my kick and my beg hot-keys simultaneously.  When I get disarm it will be linked to that &quot;1&quot; key as well.  <br>
<br>
I'm also trying to not deviate too much from my standard operating keys and hot-key linkage that I still use on my monk.  Unfortunately, hot-key linking is remembered across all your characters and not just the one you first set it up on.  I'm really trying to avoid having to spend 30 minutes redefining key-links every time I switch between my monk and the warrior.  So... adding yet another pad of hot-keys will just complicate the process further.<br>

<br>
How many keys do you need?  Bash, taunt, disarm, incoming, sit (if you're lazy like me), beg maybe, kick...that's 7, and you won't be kicking and bashing together.  Incoming you can toss on another pad and jump back and forth, put a ranged weapon next to it.  So we're down to 5ish, which leaves room for the bash trick.  Set up an identical pad for non-bashing with any other keys you want.  Replace sit with /assist maybe?  For combat purposes you don't need Sense heading and so forth, move those onto a second pad along with Incoming and so forth.  Just a thought.<br>
<br>
If you're combining keys you should be even better off.  That kick/taunt/beg hotkey will work fine, just press it in between bashes since kick and bash don't work together.  You're looking at reassinging everything once maybe, to be the best warrior you can be?<br>
<br>
Just be glad you're not a bard, with their hotkey boxes.  Spells, plus swap spots, plus any special hotkeys they decide they need.<br>
<br>
Not trying to be legalistic here, I've been watching this thread for a bit now.  Just simple things that can be overcome.  Like, removing a certain loudmouthed mage to Tox!  (c'mere Kalyth...you can trust me...really...)<br>
