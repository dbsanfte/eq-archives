<br>
Normally I  mostly just dont answer to any requests but sow and bind.  So I just pretend most of the people arent there. <br>
Yes I know this is rude, but theres way to many of them.<br>
<br>
Anyway this one hobbit was sending tells, and standing between me and my mule, and just being irritating, and getting more and more mad at me as i ignored him i guess, cause a few minutes later my Mule gets a tell...<br>
<br>
&quot;That Iisbliss is such a bitch, dont try to get anything from her, I think she must be afk&quot;<br>
<br>
well my Mule was sympathetic, and replied to him &quot;Yeah these high levels think they can just do what they want and ignore people, I hate them.  Can you spare some PP?&quot;<br>
<br>
he answered &quot;No I've been asking for PP here for hours now and no one has given me any.&quot;<br>
<br>
oh well = )<br>

I saw that work once.<br>
<br>
I was standing around at the bank in Kaladim a while back talking with some genuine (I think) newbies that I knew from having grouped with them with my low level alt. Up comes a noobie beggar named Renim, level 5 I think, interrupting our conversation to ask for handouts.<br>
<br>
Now, I have it set so that when people inspect me the see a message asking them not to beg from me in my character &quot;bio&quot; window. Professional beggars always inspect first to see if you are worth their time to beg from, so that message has helped cut down on the number of panhandlers I have to deal with. So anyway this Dwarf comes up, totally naked and armed only with a fishing pole, inspects me, and then says to give him money and armor.<br>
<br>
My first response is simply &quot;nope&quot;. He then turns and begs from my two newbie companions (who are only a level or two above him and had EARNED what they had...I know because  sold em that bronze armor myself), and they basically tell him to get lost. He doesn't leave though. <br>
<br>
When he asks for like the fifth time if I have any spare plat I could give him, I say no, but if you have ten thousand spare plat you could give to me, I need it to buy a Deepwater Breastplate. I think the comment must have went over his head though since he just repeats himself again as if he didn't hear me.<br>
<br>
He has penetrated my first three layers of Noobie Beggah Defense(tm), so now I have to whip out my hotbutton:<br>
<br>
/em makes a dismissive gesture<br>
/say AWAY with you, beggah!<br>
<br>
I stole that line from Baldur's Gate BTW. Does he take the hint then? Nope. More like he figures his problem was not saying &quot;plz&quot; enough. So he stands there saying &quot;plz&quot; repeatedly.<br>
<br>
One of the newbies I had been chatting with suggests that he go kill some monsters and collect their stuff. The beggar says he can't kill monsters because all he has is a fishing pole; he has no armor or weapons at all. He makes rather a big deal about not having anything and that's why he needs to beg.<br>
<br>
Anyway, this goes on for a few minutes and gets tiresome rather quickly. When he says he will follow us around until we give him something though, I guess that was the last straw and one of my companions tells him to target him and type /d to enter &quot;donation mode.&quot;<br>
<br>
He does, and Beggar runs away after getting hit once. Less than a minute later he comes back wearing full banded and wielding a halberd, but an NPC aggros on him and kills him before he could fight. The three of us stand over his corpse and /laugh and /point at him when he comes back to loot it.<br>
<br>
It was mean I know, but he was just SO obnoxious. And it turned out that he was being dishonest anyway, so I think he got what he deserved. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessage?topicID=400.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessage?topicID=421.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=396.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.threadControl?topicID=396.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=396.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=396.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Diplomacy Corner<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Administration Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6>NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
