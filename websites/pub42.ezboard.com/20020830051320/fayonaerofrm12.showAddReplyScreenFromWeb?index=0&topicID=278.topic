Not having time to get the paperwork to take the puppy on board, the man just hid the pup down the front of his pants and snuck him on board the airplane.

Later, the stewardess noticed the man moaning and shaking again. "Are you sure you're alright sir?" "Yes," said the man, "but I have a confession to make. I didn't have time to get the paperwork to bring a puppy on board, so I hid him down the front of my pants." "What's wrong?" asked the stewardess. "Is he not housebroken?"

When a storm came up and ice formed on his wings, he fell to earth in a barnyard, almost frozen, and when a cow crapped on him, the sparrow figured this was the end.

He fills his glass up with milk, when he looks down and realizes his dick is still really hot, so he sticks his dick in the glass of milk to cool it down. Just as he does the blonde walks in and says, "I always wondered how you refilled those things!" <br>
<br>
<br>
What's a blonde's idea of safe sex? <br>

Turns on the lights. <br>
<br>

Toes Go In First. <br>
<br>
<br>
What's a blonde's favorite fairy tale? <br>
"Hump-me Dump-me." <br>
<br>
<br>
How does a man show he's planning for the future? - He buys two cases of beer instead of one. <br>
<br>
<br>
Why do elephants have flat feet? To stamp out flaming ducks! ( hey they get better okay ! ) <br>

<br>
A student comes to a young professor's office hours. She glances down the hall, closes his door, kneels pleadingly. <br>
<br>
"I would do anything to pass this exam." <br>
<br>
She leans closer to him, flips back her hair, gazes meaningfully into his eyes. <br>
<br>
"I mean..." she whispers, "...I would do... anything!!!" <br>
<br>
He returns her gaze. "Anything???" <br>
<br>
"Yes,... Anything!!!" <br>
<br>
His voice turns to a whisper. "Would you... study???" <br>
<br>
The only thing that the IRS has not yet taxed is the penis. This is due to the fact that 40% of the time it is hanging around unemployed, 30% of the time it is hard up, 20% of the time it is pissed off and 10% of the time it's in the hole. It has two dependents, but they're nuts. <br>
<br>
Effective January 1, 2001, penises will be taxed according to size. The brackets are as Follows: <br>
<br>
10"-12" Luxury Tax <br>
8"-10" Pole Tax <br>
5"-8" Privilege Tax <br>
4"-5" Nuisance Tax <br>
<br>
<br>
Males exceeding 12" must file under capital gains. Anyone under 4" is eligible for a refund. <br>
<br>
PLEASE DO NOT ASK FOR AN EXTENSION! <br>
<br>
Issues still under consideration are as follows: <br>
<br>
Are there penalties for early withdrawal? <br>
<br>
Do multiple partners count as a corporation? <br>
<br>
Are condoms deductible as work clothes? <br>
<br>
Pope and the queen<br>
<br>
The Pope and the Queen of England are on the same stage in front of a huge crowd. Her Majesty and His Holiness, however, have seen it all before, so to make it a little more interesting, the Queen says to the Pope, "Did you know that with just one little wave of my hand I can make every English person in the crowd go wild?" He doubts it, so she shows him. <br>
<br>
Sure enough, the royal-gloved wave elicits rapture and cheering from every English person in the crowd. <br>
<br>
Gradually, the cheering subsides. The Pope, not wanting to be outdone by someone wearing a worse frock and hat than he, considers what he could do. <br>
<br>
"Your Majesty, that was impressive. But did you know that with just one little wave of MY hand I can make every Irish person in the crowd go crazy with joy? This joy will not be a momentary display like that of your subjects, but will go deep into their hearts, and they will forever speak of this day and rejoice." <br>
<br>
The Queen seriously doubts this, and says so. <br>
<br>
"One little wave of your hand and all Irish people will rejoice forever? Show me." <br>
<br>
So the Pope slapped her. <br>
<br>

An old man was sitting on a bench in the mall when a young man with spiked hair came over and sat down beside him. <br>
<br>
The boy's hair was yellow and green and orange and purple. He had black makeup around his eyes. The old man just stared intensely at him for several minutes. <br>
<br>
The boy, becoming aggitated with the old man's gaze, said, "What's the matter old man, haven't you ever done anything wild in your life?" <br>
<br>
The old mand answered, "Well yes, actually I have. Once I got drunk and had sex with a parrot. <br>
<br>
I was just wondering if you were my son... <br>
<br>
A medical student decided to study sexual dysfunction as his specialty. <br>
<br>
On his first day in the hospital, the chief doctor decided to show him around and to start teaching his new student about this area of medicine. <br>
<br>
As part of the training, the chief doctor decided to bring the student around to all the patients in his wing so the student could see firsthand some of the diseases. <br>
<br>
The doctor opened the first patient's door and the student was stunned to see the patient masturbating. The doctor explained that this patient had a rare sexual dysfunction that if he didn't have an orgasm every five minutes, he would go into traumatic shock. <br>
<br>
The Chief Doctor proceeded to show the medical student different patients and carefully explained each problem so the student would understand well. <br>
<br>
Finally they came upon another room and when the doctor opened the door, the student was shocked to see a nurse performing oral sex on the patient. <br>
<br>
Confused, the student asked "What disease does this man have?" <br>
<br>
"Oh," said the doctor, "He has the same problem as the first patient, he just has a better healthplan." <br>
<br>
There was a guy sunbathing in the nude. <br>
<br>
He saw a little girl coming toward him, so he covered himself with the newspaper he was reading. <br>
<br>
The girl came up to him and asked, "What do you have under the newspaper?" <br>
<br>
Thinking quickly, the guy replied, "A bird." <br>
<br>
The girl walked away, and the guy fell asleep. <br>
<br>
When he woke up, he was in a hospital in tremendous pain. <br>
<br>
The police asked him what happened. The guy says, "I don't know. I was lying on the beach, this little girl asked me a question, I guess I dozed off, and the next thing I know is I'm here." <br>
<br>
The police went to the beach, found the girl, and asked her, "What did you do to that naked fellow?" <br>
<br>
After a pause, the girl replied, "To him? Nothing. I was playing with his bird and it spit on me, so I broke its neck, cracked its eggs, and set its nest on fire!" <br>
<br>
Moral of the story: never lie to kids. <br>

Why did the chicken cros the road :<br>
<br>
PAT BUCHANAN<br>
To steal a job from a decent, hardworking American. <br>
<br>
DR. SEUSS<br>
Did the chicken cross the road?<br>
Did he cross it with a toad?<br>
Yes! The chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed, I've not been told! <br>
<br>
ERNEST HEMINGWAY<br>
To die. In the rain. <br>
<br>
JERRY FALWELL<br>
Because the chicken was gay! Isn't it obvious? Can't you people see the plain truth in front of your face? The chicken was going to the "other side." That's what "they" call it-the "other side." Yes, my friends, that chicken is gay. And, if you eat that chicken, you will become gay too. I say we boycott all chickens until we sort out this abomination that the liberal media whitewashes with seemingly harmless phrases like "the other side." That chicken should not be free to cross the road. It's as plain and simple as that. <br>
<br>
MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.<br>
I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads without having their motives called into question. <br>
<br>
GRANDPA<br>
In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Someone told us that the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough for us. <br>
<br>
ARISTOTLE<br>
It is the nature of chickens to cross the road. <br>
<br>
KARL MARX<br>
It was a historical inevitability. <br>
<br>
SADDAM HUSSAIN<br>
This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it. <br>
<br>
RONALD REAGAN<br>
What chicken? <br>
<br>
CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK<br>
To boldly go where no chicken has gone before. <br>
<br>
FOX MULDER<br>
You saw it cross the road with your own eyes. How many more chickens have to cross before you believe it? <br>
<br>
FREUD<br>
The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity. <br>
<br>
BILL GATES<br>
I have just released eChicken 2000, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook and Internet Explorer is an inextricable part of eChicken. <br>
<br>
EINSTEIN<br>
Did the chicken really cross the road or did the road move beneath the chicken? <br>
<br>
BILL CLINTON<br>
I did not cross the road with THAT chicken. What do you mean by "chicken"? Could you define "chicken" please? <br>
<br>
GEORGE W. BUSH<br>
I don't think I should have to answer that question. <br>
<br>
LOUIS FARRAKHAN<br>
The road, you will see, represents the black man. The chicken crossed the "black man" in order to trample him and keep him down. <br>
<br>
THE BIBLE<br>
And God came down from the heavens, and He said unto the chicken, "Thou shalt cross the road." And the chicken crossed the road, and there was much rejoicing. <br>

COLONEL SANDERS<br>
I missed one? <br>
<br>
A team of archaeologists was excavating in Israel when they came upon a cave. Written across the wall of the cave were the following symbols, in this order of appearance: <br>
<br>
A woman, a donkey, a shovel, a fish, and a Star of David. <br>
<br>
It was considered a unique find and the writings were said to be at least three thousand years old. The piece of stone was removed, brought to the museum, and archaeologists from around the world came to study the ancient symbols. They held a huge meeting after months of conferences to discuss the meaning of the markings. <br>
<br>
The President of the society pointed at the first drawing and said: "This looks like a woman. We can judge that this race was family oriented and held women in high esteem. You can also tell they were intelligent, as the next symbol resembles a donkey, so, they were smart enough to have animals help them till the soil. The next drawing looks like a shovel of some sort, which means they even had tools to help them. Even further proof of their high intelligence is the fish which means that if a famine had hit the earth, whereby the food didn't grow, they would take to the sea for food. The last symbol appears to be the Star of David which means they were evidently Hebrews." <br>
<br>
The audience applauded enthusiastically. But, a little old man stood up in the back of the room and said, "Idiots! Hebrew is read from right to left. <br>
<br>
It says: Holy Mackerel, Dig The @#%$ On That Woman!" <br>

Redneck Letter<br>
<br>
Dearest Redneck Son, <br>
<br>
I'm writing this slow because I know you can't read fast. We don't live where we did when you left home. Your Dad read in the newspaper that most accidents happen within 20 miles of your home, so we moved. I won't be able to send you the address because the last Alabama family that lived here took the house numbers when they moved so they wouldn't have to change their address. <br>
<br>
This place is really nice. It even has a washing machine. I'm not sure it works so well, though. Last week I put a load of clothes in and pulled the chain. We haven't seen them since. <br>
<br>
The weather isn't bad here. It only rained twice last week; the first time for three days and the second time for four days. About that coat you wanted me to send; your Uncle Billy Bob said it would be too heavy to send in the mail with the buttons on, so we cut them off and put them in the pockets. <br>
<br>
Bubba locked his keys in the car yesterday. We were really worried because it took him two hours to get me and your father out. <br>
<br>
Your sister had a baby this morning, but I haven't found out what it is yet, so I don't know if you are an aunt or uncle. The baby looks just like your brother. <br>
<br>
Uncle Bobby Ray fell into a whiskey vat last week. Some men tried to pull him out but he fought them off and drowned. We had him cremated...... he burned for three days. <br>
<br>
Three of your friends went off a bridge in a pickup truck. Butch was driving. He rolled down the window and swam to safety. Your other two friends were in the back. They drowned because they couldn't get the tailgate down. <br>
<br>
There isn't much more news at this time. Nothing much out of the normal has happened. <br>
<br>

Nude Statues<br>
<br>
Two nude statues (one male & one female) had been standing in the middle of a beautiful park for 99 years. <br>
<br>
On their 100th anniversary in the park an angel came down from heaven to talk to the statues. <br>
<br>
He said to them "God has been watching you for the past 100 years and has been very pleased with the two of you. So pleased in fact that he has decided to grant you a wish of becoming human for a short time." <br>
<br>
The angel then went on to say that they would be human for fifteen minutes and will finally be able to pleasure themselves in a manner in which they have only fantasized about for the last 100 years. <br>
<br>
The statues were so excited they could hardly believe it. <br>
<br>
The second they became human they ran off together behind the bushes. <br>
<br>
The angel heard the rustling of the bushes and shouts of joy and laughter. <br>
<br>
After 10 minutes the statues returned from behind the bushes sweating and laughing. <br>
<br>
The angel told the statues that they still had 5 more minutes. <br>
<br>
The male statue quickly turned to the female statue and said: "Cool, this time, you hold down the pigeon and I'll @#%$ on his head." <br>
<br>
if Cars were Like Microsoft<br>
<br>
At a recent computer expo (COMDEX), Bill Gates reportedly compared the computer industry with the auto industry and stated: "If GM had kept up with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving twenty-five dollar cars that got 1000 miles to the gallon." In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued a press release stating (by Mr. Welch himself): If GM had developed technology like Microsoft, we would all be driving cars with the following characteristics: <br>
<br>
1. For no reason whatsoever your car would crash twice a day. <br>
<br>
2. Every time they repainted the lines on the road you would have to buy a new car. <br>
<br>
3. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason, and you would just accept this, restart and drive on. <br>
<br>
4. Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn, would cause your car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to reinstall the engine. <br>
<br>
5. Only one person at a time could use the car, unless you bought "Car95" or "CarNT." But then you would have to buy more seats. <br>
<br>
6. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, reliable, five times as fast, and twice as easy to drive, but would only run on five per cent of the roads. <br>
<br>
7. The oil, water temperature and alternator warning lights would be replaced by a single "general car default" warning light. <br>
<br>
8. New seats would force everyone to have the same size butt. <br>
<br>
9. The airbag system would say "Are you sure?" before going off. <br>
<br>
10. Occasionally for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle, turned the key, and grab hold of the radio antenna. <br>
<br>
11. GM would require all car buyers to also purchase a deluxe set of Rand McNally road maps (now a GM subsidiary), even though they neither need them nor want them. Attempting to delete this option would immediately cause the car's performance to diminish by 50% or more. Moreover, GM would become a target for investigation by the Justice Department. <br>
<br>
12. Every time GM introduced a new model car buyers would have to learn how to drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the same manner as the old car. <br>
<br>
13. You'd press the "start" button to shut off the engine. <br>
<br>
<br>
Did you ever stop to wonder what would happen if your dog's name was Mypenis? <br>
<br>
Mypenis ate my homework. <br>
<br>
Oh, no! Mypenis is frothing at the mouth! <br>
<br>
Sorry I'm late. I was playing with Mypenis. <br>
<br>
I'm sorry, Officer. I didn't realize I had to keep Mypenis on a leash. <br>
<br>
Mypenis doesn't come when I call it. <br>
<br>
Mypenis likes to crawl between the legs of guests. <br>
<br>
I love giving Mypenis a bath. <br>
<br>
At night, I sleep with Mypenis in my hands. <br>
<br>
Mypenis likes it when people pet him. <br>
<br>
Mypenis needs to get more exercise. He weighs over fifty pounds! <br>
<br>
Playing with Mypenis really wears me out. <br>
<br>
Would you like to see a picture of Mypenis? <br>
<br>
Sometimes I wake up, and Mypenis is already active. <br>
<br>
I think Mypenis has a mind of its own. <br>
<br>
I keep a picture of Mypenis in my wallet. <br>
<br>
Whenever I get lost, Mypenis points me in the right direction. <br>
<br>
I think Mypenis is getting old because he won't get excited anymore. He just plays dead. <br>
<br>
Mypenis got out last night. I think he's sleeping with the lady next door. <br>
<br>
If Mypenis was a weinerdog, he would be long and hairy and hard to carry. <br>
<br>
Mypenis loves to chase pussies in dark alleys. <br>
<br>
Help! I can't find Mypenis! <br>
<br>
Sorry to be driving so slow, officer, but I was looking for Mypenis. <br>
<br>
Mypenis gets excited whenever the mailman comes. <br>
<br>
Sorry to be driving so fast, officer. I have to take Mypenis to the hospital. <br>
<br>
Oh. no! Something bit Mypenis! <br>
<br>
<br>
Beer make men women<br>
<br>
Yesterday scientists for Health Canada suggested that men should take a look at their beer consumption, considering the results of a recent analysis that revealed the presence of female hormones in beer. <br>
<br>
The theory is that drinking beer makes men turn into women. To test the theory, 100 men were fed 6 pints of beer each. It was then observed that 100% of the men gained weight, talked excessively without making sense, became overly emotional, couldn't drive, failed to think rationally, argued over nothing, and refused to apologize when wrong. <br>
<br>
No further testing is planned.<br>
<br>

The Reverend John Fuzz was pastor of a small congregation in a little Pennsylvania town. One day he was walking down Main Street and he happened to notice a female member of his congregation sitting in the town bar, drinking beer. The reverend thought this was sinful and not something a member of his congregation should do, so he walked through the open door of the bar and sat down next to the woman.<br>
<br>
"Mrs. Fitzgerald," the reverend said sternly. "This is no place for a member of my congregation. Why don't you let me take you home?"<br>
<br>
"Shure," she said with a slur, obviously very drunk.<br>
<br>
When Mrs Fitzgerald stood up from the bar, she began to weave back and forth. The reverend realized that she had had too much to drink and he grabbed hold of her arms to steady her. When he did, they both lost their balance and tumbled to the floor.<br>
<br>
After rolling around for a few seconds, the reverend wound up lying on top of Mrs. Fitzgerald, her skirt hiked up to her waist.<br>
<br>
The bartender looked over the bar and said, "Here, here, buddy, we won't have any of that carrying on in this bar."<br>
<br>
The reverend looked up at the bartender and said, "But you don't understand, I'm Pastor Fuzz."<br>
<br>
The bartender nodded, "Well, heck, if you're that far along you might as well finish the job."<br>

A certain college professor was notorious for getting off the topic of the lecture, and on to his favorite subject: the evils of marijuana.<br>
<br>
Off he went one day into his inventory of horrors, "Used regularly," he explained, "pot can cause psychic disorientation, sterility, cancer and castration!"<br>
<br>
"Now wait a minute, professor," interrupted a student. "Castration? That's absurd!"<br>
<br>
"Yes young man, it's sadly true," replied the professor smugly. "Just suppose your girlfriend gets the munchies!" <br>

"Bob Smith, my assistant programmer, can always be found <br>
hard at work in his cubicle. Bob works independently, without <br>
wasting company time talking to colleagues. Bob never <br>

measures to complete his work, sometimes skipping coffee <br>
breaks. Bob is a dedicated individual who has absolutely no <br>
vanity, in spite of his high accomplishments and profound <br>

The Puerto Rican asks, "Why did you do that? That was perfectly good bottle of vodka!"<br>
<br>
The Russian replies, "There's plenty of that where I come from."<br>
<br>
The Puerto Rican doesn't want to be upstaged, so he removes a joint from his pocket, takes a long puff, and then throws the rest of it over the bridge.<br>
<br>
The American exclaims, "Hey! What the hell did you do that for? That was a perfectly good joint!"<br>
<br>
The Puerto Rican replies, "There's plenty of that where I come from."<br>
<br>
Now, the American doesn't want to be upstaged, so he searches through his pockets but he can't find anything. He looks around for a moment, then grabs the Puerto Rican and throws him over the bridge.<br>
<br>
The Russian exclaims, "What the hell did you do that for?"<br>
<br>
The American replies, "There's plenty of that where I come from." <br>
<br>
One evening, while sharing a few drinks at the bar, one of the ladies suggests, "Let's name our Leroys after a soda pop, because I'm tired of getting my Leroy mixed up with your Leroy, and her Leroy mixed up with your Leroy."<br>
<br>
The other two ladies agree.<br>
<br>
The first lady speaks out, "Okay then, I'm gonna name my Leroy 7-Up because he has 7 inches and it's always up!"<br>
<br>
The three ladies hoot and holler, and slap each other high fives.<br>
<br>
Then, the second lady says, "I'm gonna name my Leroy Mountain Dew because he can mount and do me any day of the week."<br>
<br>
Again, the three ladies hoot and holler, and slap each other more high fives. <br>
<br>
The third lady then says, "You know, those two Leroys were good, but I'm gonna name my Leroy, Jack Daniels." <br>
<br>
The other two ladies shout in unison, "Jack Daniels? That's not a soda pop... that's a hard liquor!" <br>
<br>
The third lady bursts out, "That's my Leroy!"  <p><center>Indra Battlecleric<BR>60th High Priest<BR>Proud Member of Immortal Mercy</Center><Center><BR><BR>"To heal... or not to heal... that... is the question!"</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ugeaenie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Geaenie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Regular Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(5/8/02 5:50:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=278.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Collection of Jokes, LONG! *warning - some are explicit*</span><hr size=1> ACK!

Two nuns were driving down a long country road in a pickup truck when suddenly a blinding red flash dazzled them. As the vision slowly returned to their eyes to their horror they saw the Devil before them. The driving nun quickly slammed on the breaks and turned to the other nun, quickly shouting &quot;Show him your Cross! Show him your Cross!&quot;<br>
<br>
The second nun rolled down her window, leaned out and shouted &quot;Motherfucker!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
