For some strange reason I decided that I felt bad for her(who is really a he) so decided to try and be his friend. He seemed friendly enough, and I assumed that we had a friendship between us. When the guild broke up and the people started a new guild, Nandari wasn't invited. I asked all the officers of our new guild to please let Nandari join. Eventually he was invited. Well a long time has passed, and he disliked the guild that I have joined. In the past he has refused to port an alt of mine because he knew it was me. Thats no biggie. I let that go and decided to never talk to that person again.<br><br>   Today in SH, I pulled a NPC to the bazaar zone like to make the SH faction quest go a little faster. Nandari's alt  Athur attacked the NPC and trained him away. Soo  i decided to pull him back and continue. The second that I did, Athur came back, and trained the guy all the way across the zone again. <br><br>Well I was leaving anyway to go kill a mob(happened to be the same mob that Nandari, and the new VV were also going to kill) so I wasn't too upset at having the guy pulled across the zone. Anyway I saw her-him-it in the deep and decided to let my feelings be shown in /ooc.<br><br>Part of what I said in /ooc was directed to IM-New VV. The reason for that was because thier members have been messing with me all week. Besides this gay Nandari thing, in SH like a day or two ago, an IM member was using the forge in the tall person shop. He told me he was using it and that I would have to wait. So instead of starting an argument about how there is no claim to forges, I decided to just let him use the forge(he later told me he would only be on it for 30 minutes) all to himself. When a friend came to visit me and just say hello, he got rude to him saying &quot;Player_21 I am using the forge now, you can't&quot;. I asked my friend in tells to just ignore that, and he did. 30 mins later about while I was just sitting there he finished. So I started to use the forge, and guess what happened? Another IM member came up and took over the forge. Now I am not the fastest smither, but this person was taking 10 minutes a pop between buying more materials. I explained to him that I had waited for one of his guild members to finish with it, and what he told me was &quot;Sorry, this spot has everything that I need&quot;. Well, it turns out that this member was at skill point 3 in smithing and he must have just decided that this was a good time to start to work skills up. So, I decided to bind there to buy what I needed  and run to the other forge, then gate back when needed.  So far I just assumed that these were prolly young kids who haven't been taught propper manners. So I had no feelings that IM as a guild was &quot;out to get me&quot;. I am not sure how long that member was there, maybe an hour or 2, but when he left guess what happened? Yet another IM member came and started &quot;using&quot; the forge. I stood by the forge waiting my turn and maybe 20 minutes passed. I decided to send that member a tell. No responce. I waited one hour. There is no way in the world that it can take you one hour to  combine 8 full bags worth of stuff. He was either afk, or just trying to piss me off(maybe some one's alt). I logged.<br><br> There was another event that happened with brewing. Also an IM member. I sent a tell to Fantor. I have been told that he is a nice guy, and that he holds some wieght in IM. He seemed very pleasent, and told me that IM had nothing against me, or my guild. Do I belive him? Maybe. Could it be that he has no idea that the guild he's in does have a set plan to mess with me-us? Maybe.<br><br>What ever is happening is pure shit. On a PvP server suuuure, try and pull that stuff. I would camp your ass until you left for SWG or EQ2. But doing this on a server like ours is just rude. It's times like these that I am glad to be in a guild that blows away other guilds with assholes like these in them. Being able to kill mobs that these people may never be able to may not be as fun as getting some friends together and killing them. But it is some thing &gt;;O)<br><br><br>Am I wrong? Did the people not even notice what guild I was in when the skrewed me doing trade skills? Would Nandari have trained that NPC across an entire zone 2 times even if he didn't see me there? Maybe. But I doubt it.  Would I ever petition some one for doing these types of things? No. Thats not what the game is about to me.<br><br>Fuck off,<br>Croff Dancingbear.<br><br> <p> <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=142983" TARGET="NEW"> Croff Dancingbear</a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uothen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Othen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/4/02 5:35:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1453.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nandari-Athur suck ass</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>Well along time ago when I was in another guild we had this wizard that no one liked(Nandari)<br><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>I really dont know what ur talking about, nor do I try to deceifer what ur trying to say, but from what I've experienced personally from Nandari is nothing but welcomeness.

You hadn't been around in a while, you didn't ask me to send you a tell when I was done, so I did what anyone would have done.  I sent a tell to a guildie that would want to use the forge.
