and btw XML as in extensive markup language is a great thing but you can use C ,C++, java, fortran, cobal, assembler etc etc right from the shell in linux...<br>
and while the win2k is more adapt to buissniess apps id say the system itself eats way to much effect of your computer/server  hell NT4 used almost 64mb ram just to exist at a time when 64mbram was a helluva lot of memory...<br>
you can run a linux based webserver from a 1.44 floppy  try to run the bluescreen from Win2k on a floppy...<br>
overall id say win platform is the better choice for the common user but for a server solution id keep my cash on linux or some of the more common Unix versions. TRU64 is a fave tho..<br>
the power from linux is that it is totaly free and you can do whatever you want with it, its there for you to change or use how you want not the other way around.<br>

<br>
First, the &quot;but where did the apes come from&quot; response demonstrates a very poor understanding of evolution.  Man and modern day apes both evolved from the same primitive ancesters quite a few million years in the past.  These ancestors, in turn, evolved from more primitive life forms right down to the so-called &quot;primordial soup.&quot;  From here evolution leaves off and abiogenesis -- the origins of the first lifeforms -- begin ( a whole 'nother discussion, but one quite open to scientific discussion without appeal to supernaturalism).<br>
<br>
Regarding the consistency of the bible over time, this is not quite the case.  There are no extant copies of original biblical documents. All we have are copies of copies of copies and so on.  Over time, not only are transcription errors made, but with the evolution of language and differences in interpretation, different translations emerge.  Remember the phrase, &quot;peace on earth, and good will towards men&quot;?  This is a mistranslation caused by the loss of a single letter (a sigma, IIRC).  The actual, less virtuous, translation is &quot;peace on earth toward men of goodwill.&quot;<br>
<br>
A simple overview of current bibles shows quite a few differences in translation.  The traditional King James supports the views of the ruling monarch.  The New International Version is generally regarded as a good translation, but smooths over places where the bible would contradict itself (such as Jeremiah, where the unjustified addition of the word &quot;just&quot; prevents contradiction with teh burnt offerings of Exodus).  The Jehovah's Witnesses have their own translation as well, suited to their beliefs.<br>
<br>
The Dead Sea Scrolls don't really support or verify anything said in the bible.  At most they are copies of books therein.  However, at least one book of the prophets (don't recall which one, Nehemiah maybe) differs quite a bit from the translation we're accustomed to.  Mostly, the scrolls concern the way of life of their writers, the Essenes.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;C) Other histories written by people in the area/time of the bible's writings (IE Egyptians, Sumerians etc) also support things written of in the bible.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Erm, not quite.  There is no certifiable archaeological record of a massive Hebrew presence in Egypt, nor of the exodus.  There are no archaeological findings of 2-3 million Hebrews wandering for 40  years in an area roughly the size of WVa.  Egypt was never uninhabited and uninhabitable for any period as recorded in Ezekiel.  The book of Daniel makes many errors regarding the history of Nebuchadnezzar and his successors, and biblical scholars (excluding fundamentalists) recognize that it was written in the 2nd century BCE, rather than the 6th.  Lastly, much of Genesis (e.g., the Flood) was derived from earlier Sumerian and Babylonian myths. <br>
<br>
Lessee...ah, the Koran and the Big Bang.  The Koran's view of creation doesn't mirror what is suggested by science quite as well as promoters might wish you to think.  The Koran suggests that everything began with &quot;smoke,&quot; for instance.  But our best understanding is that the earliest moments of the universe began with a burst of pure energy.  After some billionths of a second this cooled to plasma, and eventually to gases (which still doesn't really equate to smoke).  There are other creation errors, some of which mirror Genesis (plants before sun, that kind of thing).  I recently read a very good article on just this topic.  If anyone is interested I'll try to find the link.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing&quot; is a meaningless term, scientifically and philosophically.  Or, at best, so ambiguous as to be nearly useless.  Also, the Big Bang didn't necessarily have a &quot;first moment.&quot;  Relativity leaves the arrow of time open both ways, allowing for an infinite temporal regression.  While this isn't necessarily the case, it does remove the pretext for First Cause arguments.  <br>
<br>
This thread just scratches the surface of religious discussion, something I've been involved with for a few years now in various forums.  Raised a Christian, I've studied the issue intently and have learned quite a bit.  But some years ago now I realized that Christianity didn't hold water and realized I was quite agnostic about the whole thing.  More recently, I've found myself an atheist and secular humanist, and find it a much more rewarding way to live.  <br>
<br>
Lastly, a quote:<br>
<br>
&quot;We are both atheists, I simply disbelieve in one more god than you do.  When you understand why you don't believe in all the other gods, you will understand why I don't believe in yours.&quot; (no idea who first said this)<br>

Me, I'm quite torn between the religion thing.  Stories claim God always seemed to be interacting with people 'back in the day', but when was the last time someone interacted with him?  And if God doesn't approve of incest(does it say that in the bible anywhere?), why did He make it so Adam and Eve's children had to reproduce with eachother?<br>

<br>
WASHINGTON, DC—Calling the theological giant's stranglehold on the religion industry &quot;blatantly anti-competitive,&quot; a U.S. district judge ruled Monday that God is in violation of anti-monopoly laws and ordered Him to be broken up into several less powerful deities.<br>
   <br>
      &quot;The evidence introduced in this trial has convinced me that the deity known as God has willfully and actively thwarted competition from other deities and demigods, promoting His worship with such unfair scare tactics as threatening non-believers with eternal damnation,&quot; wrote District Judge Charles Elliot Schofield in his decision. &quot;In the process, He has carved out for Himself an illegal monotheopoly.&quot;<br>
<br>
      The suit, brought against God by the Justice Department on behalf of a coalition of &quot;lesser deities&quot; and polytheistic mortals, alleged that He violated antitrust laws by claiming in the Holy Bible that He was the sole creator of the universe, and by strictly prohibiting the worship of what He termed &quot;false idols.&quot;<br>
<br>
      &quot;God clearly commands that there shall be no other gods before Him, and He frequently employs the phrase 'I AM the Lord' to intimidate potential deserters,&quot; prosecuting attorney Geoffrey Albert said. &quot;God uses other questionable strongarm tactics to secure and maintain humanity's devotion, demanding, among other things, that people sanctify their firstborn to Him and obtain circumcisions as a show of faith. There have also been documented examples of Him smiting those caught worshipping graven images.&quot;<br>
<br>
      Attorneys for God did not deny such charges. They did, however, note that God offers followers &quot;unbeatable incentives&quot; in return for their loyalty, including eternal salvation, protection from harm, and &quot;fruitfulness.&quot;<br>
<br>
      &quot;God was the first to approach the Jewish people with a 'covenant' contract that guaranteed they would be the most favored in His eyes, and He handed down standards of morality, cleanliness, and personal conduct that exceeded anything else practiced at the time,&quot; lead defense attorney Patrick Childers said. &quot;He readily admits to being a 'jealous' God, not because He is threatened by the prospect of competition from other gods, but because He is utterly convinced of the righteousness of His cause and that He is the best choice for mortals. Many of these so-called gods could care less if somebody bears false witness or covets thy neighbor's wife. Our client, on the other hand, is truly a 'People's God.'&quot;<br>
<br>
      In the end, however, God was unable to convince Schofield that He did not deliberately create a marketplace hostile to rival deities. God's attorneys attempted to convince the judge of His openness to rivals, pointing to His longtime participation in the &quot;Holy Trinity,&quot; but the effort failed when Schofield determined that Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost are &quot;more God subsidiaries than competitors.&quot;<br>
<br>
      To comply with federal antitrust statutes, God will be required to divide Himself into a pantheon of specialized gods, each representing a force of nature or a specific human custom, occupation, or state of mind.<br>
<br>
      &quot;There will most likely be a sun god, a moon god, sea god, and rain god,&quot; said religion-industry watcher Catherine Bailey. &quot;Then there will be some second-tier deities, like a god of wine, a goddess of the harvest, and perhaps a few who symbolize human love and/or blacksmithing.&quot;<br>
<br>
      Leading theologians are applauding the God breakup, saying that it will usher in a new era of greater worshipping options, increased efficiency, and more personalized service.<br>
<br>
      &quot;God's prayer-response system has been plagued by massive, chronic backlogs, and many prayers have gone unanswered in the process,&quot; said Gene Suozzi, a Phoenix-area Wiccan. &quot;With polytheism, you pray to the deity specifically devoted to your concern. If you wish to have children, you pray to the fertility goddess. If you want to do well on an exam, you pray to the god of wisdom, and so on. This decentralization will result in more individualized service and swifter response times.&quot;<br>
<br>
      Other religious experts are not so confident that the breakup is for the best, pointing to the chaotic nature of polytheistic worship and noting that multiple gods demand an elaborate regimen of devotion that today's average worshipper may find arduous and inconvenient.<br>
<br>
      &quot;If people want a world in which they must lay burnt offerings before an earthenware household god to ensure that their car will start on a cold winter morning, I suppose they can have it,&quot; said Father Thomas Reinholdt, theology professor at Chicago's Loyola University. &quot;What's more, lesser deities are infamous for their mercurial nature. They often meddle directly in diplomatic affairs, abduct comely young mortal women for their concubines, and are not above demanding an infant or two for sacrifice. Monotheism, for all its faults, at least means convenience, stability, and a consistent moral code.&quot;<br>
<br>
      One deity who is welcoming the verdict is the ancient Greek god Zeus, who described himself as &quot;jubilant&quot; and &quot;absolutely vindicated.&quot;<br>
<br>
      &quot;For thousands of years, I've been screaming that this third-rate sky deity ripped me off wholesale,&quot; said Zeus, speaking from his Mt. Olympus residence. &quot;Every good idea He ever had He took from me: Who first created men in his own image? Who punished mankind for its sins? Who lived eternally up in the clouds? And the whole fearsome, patriarchal, white-beard, thunderbolt thing? I was doing that eons before this two-bit hustler started horning in on the action.&quot;<br>
<br>
      Lawyers for God say they plan to appeal Schofield's ruling and are prepared to go all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary.<br>
<br>
      &quot;This decision is a crushing blow to God worshippers everywhere, and we refuse to submit to a breakup until every possible avenue of argument is pursued,&quot; Childers said. &quot;I have every confidence that God will ultimately win, as He and His lawyers are all-powerful.&quot;<br>
