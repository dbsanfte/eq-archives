Logix hon, give it up.  In order to see, she would have to be a whole lot brighter then she has proven herself to be (people who claim to be a genius as much as she does... aren't).  <br>
<br>
She has her own little world, and her own little version of how things went.  And her own little justifications for dragging an entire board into the gutter with her.  <br>
<br>
(Witness her attempt to justify, to Edeina, dragging the thread into the gutter yesterday with the argument about cross posting, which happened AFTER she had already dragged it into the gutter)  In her own little mind she has justified what she is doing, you are not going to be able to change that.<br>

Your actions are not only hypocritical, they are petty, stupid and spiteful. Me, i'm just spiteful. What's your excuse? <br>
<br>
As for Loony Logix, she has taken to casting aspersions without proof like a duck to water, and is rapidly turning herself into a laughing stock. I did indeed say that I no longer had a beef with her, but that was before she once again attacked me on the boards. I guess she is just a perennial busybody. Still, at least I seem to be brightening up her shallow little world. I will invoice her later. <br>
<br>
As for not grouping with her, I posit the following question: If a person who has been playing EQ a lot for over 2 years claims to have grouped with someone, yet that person has never heard of that player's name, how is this possible?<br>
<br>
Even someone in Special Ed, or, say, Febreeza, should be able to guess the answer.   <p>Momento Malevolent  Deguilded. Defiant.

A really, really wide exaggeration along with added conversations going on in your own mind.<br>
<br>
And, if Halo says he hasn't grouped with you, I'm going to take his word over yours, as you also claimed I was guildless (buzz) and that I'm a bad Enchanter, although you've never grouped with me (buzz #2).  If you had grouped with me, you would have known I were in a guild.<br>
<br>
Unless, of course, you're talking about Halo and you at level 10 over at Orc Camp X or something, expecting him to a.) even know his class well at that level or b.) remember that at all, or you play multiple anonymous alts to suit your four hundred other personalities.<br>
<br>
However, I consider them all lies, exaggerations or figments of your imagination.  You are the one with no proof, to any of your claims.<br>
<br>
Everyone here, except for Yuegou, who seems to have some sort of love for pointless rebellion and/or devil's advocate type thing, felt you were warned, and deserved what was coming to you when you did not take heed.  Me pointing out the obvious is not attacking you.  You not wanting to believe it is you attacking yourself. <p><table>

No, heh, that was a joke.  Although, I do think it could be quite possible.<br>

<br>
Yes, Febreeza already noted that, and yes, with evidence.  You tried to weasel your way out of Edeina's warning, claiming your disruption of the grouping thread was a result of a cross-post.  Which, was untrue, as you had spewed insults on that thread before the cross-post happened.  And, it wasn't even an accidental cross-post, Febreeza was just trying to keep the crap in one thread, rather than trying to disrupt another.<br>
<br>
&gt; Where and when did I ever say that I was sorry to be out of ToV?<br>

<br>
That's impossible.<br>
<br>
Because, if you she had posted that cross-post FIRST, the quote she posted after you started spewing insults, would have never happened, and thus never been posted.<br>
<br>
Since that sounds confusing, I will break it down to a timeline.<br>
<br>
Crydee makes grouping thread.<br>
<br>
People respond.<br>
<br>
Momento throws out insults.<br>
<br>
I say 'You're very irritable today, Momento.'<br>
<br>
Momento says something about being wrathful and whatnot.<br>
<br>
Febreeza then cuts and pastes this quote into another thread, to try to not add to the degeneration of the grouping thread.<br>
<br>
Momento responds to it, and calls Febreeza some more insults.<br>
<br>
Edeina tells Momento to cut the bullshit.<br>
<br>
The end. <p><table>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> THIS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> above quote being the cross-post that seemed to get you so upset.  Of course, as Logix stated and I'm sure most other intelligent people on this board understood, I was attempting to keep all your filth all in the same thread.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Ok, mea culpa - there was some cross-post flaming going on…<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> posted by Momento on the Is there anyway to get Momento banned off the board? Thread at (10/29/01 7:22:05 pm)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> THIS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> quote above being the &quot;Lie&quot; referred to by Logix.  Of course it is not really a lie, just you trying to excuse your unacceptable behavior.<br>
<br>
Edeina's warning came because of the &quot;flame&quot; you posted in a thread that had NOTHING to do with you.  The cross-post &quot;flame&quot; came AFTER your initial attack of Logix and I.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Grow up Momento</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, get a clue, and realize that you are not ready for prime time with Febreeza, except in your own tiny mind.<br>
<br>
1)  I stated my observations of your actions on this board.  You <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> HAVE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> dragged every thread you posted in, into the gutter, spewing your filth for all to see.  <br>
2)  I have not <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NOW or EVER</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> made reference to your game playing style, or your actions in game (other than to state I would prefer never to meet you).  My observations were made from reading your attacks of diarrhea of the mouth on this board.  <br>
3)  I did not at anytime say I was happy you had been removed from your guild.  I simply stated that which you obviously missed... YOU WERE WARNED.  <br>
4)  I even (entirely sincerely) wished you good luck on finding another one.<br>
<br>
1)  You have made reference to my character and skills in game, which you have never met, or grouped with, and God willing never will.  <br>
2)  You have spewed filth about me, of which you have no knowledge.  <br>
3)  You have made up everything you possibly can about me, because you have no clue who I am or what I am like.<br>
4)  The filth that you have spewed lately is caused because of comments I made to others about you, not to you yourself.<br>
<br>
Go back to the schoolroom little boy or girl whichever you really are.  You are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NOT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> ready for prime time with Febreeza.  You can call me names till your blue in the face, they mean absolutely nothing, now or ever.  My friends know better.  People like you?  /shrug  Who cares what you think. <p><i><h6>Febreeza Tinytank - Level  56  Myrmidon<BR>
