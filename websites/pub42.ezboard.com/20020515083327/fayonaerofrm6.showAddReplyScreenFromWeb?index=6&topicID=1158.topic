<br>
We know you think IM sucks.  Move on.  But thanks for the Landslide lectures on history and ethics.  They mean a great deal to me and most people on this server.  <br>
<br>
Now, to correct an apparent misconception held by someone who cannot seem to read:  <br>
<br>
Nowhere did I EVER say we would k's a mob as was done today -- either from the underdog or from a super-duper-killer-amazing-self righteous guild like Landslide or Rest in Peace who could wipe the floor with IM (To the extent Yeugo read that into my statement, perhaps that is indicative of his own state of mind -- note Yeugo that you set your own trap about what you did 4 months ago to a little epic-less guild called IM, but hey, that's old news).  We will NEVER stoop to the level of K'Sing an engaged mob.  If it is shown that anyone in IM ever pulls the Landslide or the RiP shit, either they will be gone or I will be gone from this guild.  Period.  Full stop.<br>
<br>
If, however, Ragefire in human form has not been enagaged and we get the force there before another guild, we will engage it whether or not that guild has been &quot;camping&quot; the spot.  If another guild engages first, GOOD FOR THEM!  We lose, just like in races to Gorenaire or whatever.  Do you find that so offensive or dishonorable Yeugeo that we won't continue to be fucked by people like you?  Will we wait and see if they fail?  Sure.  I'd even venture to say we would give a guild -- whether a helpless guild like Lost Fires (I really don't think you are helpless by any stretch of the imagination LF, I am being saracastic here) that Landslide and RiP have chosen to champion or some super-duper-uber guild -- who had wiped on the dragon once for WHATEVER reason a second chance at the dragon.  <br>
<br>
(An aside, I think it kinda funny people are saying IM is so mean and huge and powerful and stomp all over the little guys when we have killed Talendor all of three times, and haven't even had the opportunity to try the others or other targets almighty Landslide thinks such a snap) <br>
<br>
Succuba<br>
Still pissed<br>

<br>
What I did to your guild? You are the dumbshit that kept pulling mobs off me while I would run them to my raid. So I pulled a shitload and you like the dumb greedy predictable shithead you are, ran out to gank another pull and got mowed by your own stupidity when the rest of them followed you to your camp. Congrats on being a predictable ganker. I didnt hold that against your guild, but appearantly you are claiming I did it to your whole guild, so I will keep that in mind with any interaction with IM in the future.<br>
<br>
I hope you learned your lesson that day. Dont take pulls off me. Its ironic that you are bitching about RIP pulling a mob off your kiter and then mention that day in Akheva... when you were pulling mobs off us almost every time I pulled one with a weapon showing. Dont start in with the tears when you are the one that decided to take pulls off me. I guess your ganking from me makes me the "Terrorist" now since I did something about it. Go cry somewhere else, you will get no sympathy here after all of your antics. You stuck your hand in the cookie jar too many times and it finally got slapped.<br>
<br>
You are the biggest fucking hypocrite of them all Succuba, and your post confirms it. You said <i>"We will kill it whenever we can for our clerics when we find it up -- immediately after patch or server repop, and during any normal spawn cycle. "Camp" it at your own risk."</i><br>
<br>
Please explain in detail what that means to those people like myself that cannot read. In my screwed up style of reading, it says you will not respect any camps, anyone thinking they are camping it do it at your own risk, ie screw you we will take it, its not a camp. Explain what you mean then instead of saying everyone has thier head up thier ass and cant read wtf you wrote. Quit being a pussy and post what you mean instead of playing games with hidden meanings. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=varulvthewarrior>Varulv the Warrior</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(3/30/02 5:05:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1158.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire</span><hr size=1> Succuba, when we said that people had moved in to our RF camps and tried to get Ragefire, you guys just said and so you do the same shit to you?<br>
<br>
When we moved in on that Ragefire camp, as soon as we knew that Matahari was done with thiers (thanks tagteaming) we got there.<br>
<br>
When you guys now state that you guys did will do the same thing on all others guilds (like we did because we also were tired of losing it) what diffrence is there between us and you?<br>
<br>
Since you think that Landslide are so damm bad, I believe ingame terrorists was your term, how can you then do the exact same thing?<br>
<br>
Atleast we learned from our mistake, we wont pull that same stunt again. You seem to do the opposite.<br>
<br>
And another thing, what the hell does being a "uber guild" or whatever you call it, have to do with ANYTHING?<br>
<br>
No one in Landslide think one bit about the strength that others guilds have when camping ragefire.<br>
<br>
Since you think that our "stealing" your RF camp was so bad, and then you try and pull the same stunt on Lost Fires with the excuse of Patch (ours was Matahari got thier camp, now it was our turn) then you are every bit as bad as the so called "über" Landslide bullies. (Glad to hear we are called über though, really warms my poor egoistical selfcentered heart) <br>
Or do the guild have to have a certain amount of dps to be bullies on a server?<br>
<br>
Hmm how many DPS does Immortal mercy have?<br>
Oh it's about x dps...<br>
Ok then they arent evil, they aren't über yet so they can't have done something wrong..<br>
<br>
About giving a guild another try, well...<br>
Sometimes people do, sometimes they don't.<br>
If you gather tons of people to kill him off and RiP just have to wait there until you have 40 people plus, I really can't blame them for doing him. <br>
After first try I guess RF is as much a race as anything else....<br>
<br>
I really don't know how Landslide would handle a situation like that today, that's why I am glad I have officers to takes orders from. I am just a dumb warrior doing what my command tells me to. <p><center>

Failing means the next guild will move in on him. Its common practice that if two guilds are waiting for a spawn, the first one there usually gets first whack and if they fail, the 2nd one gets to go. The GMs have had to watch the uber guilds do this routine with mobs like the AoW, etc in the past. IM failed. RIP was up. Kiting it around and claiming it is a tactic used on Lodizol all the time. It never has floated in the past, and it doesnt float here so I dont think that will cover the mob being yours. You tried and died. RIP was up.<br>
<br>
Now before flying off the handle... that doesnt take into account the 4 adds you had. If those were indeed trained (and im not saying they werent) then you got shafted plain and simple. While my post said it was karma coming back to haunt you, it doesnt mean its not a shitty deal for ya. I know that being in your shoes, I would be pissed off and disappointed too.<br>
<br>
You now know the feeling LF and friends experienced when IM sat down in force at the Ragefire camp, we felt that 7 straight days of camping was about to go down the shitter just like that. Fortunately for us, ours ended on a good note, but yours didnt and for that, you have my sympathies. This is separate from the other issues, I just wanted to say that while we disagree on the other subjects and tangents, I do agree that I would be bummed in your current situation too. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/usuccuba.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Succuba</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(3/30/02 5:46:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1158.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> What I mean</span><hr size=1> is that you cannot read Yeugeo.

<br>
In your earlier post you jumped to the conclusion that I said we would train while another guild was engaged and KS like happened today, when I said nothing of the sort.  Now in your nuclear assault on me, you backtrack to what I did say in my first post -- we will treat Ragefire as any other Kunark Dragon.  Regardless of whether a group has been &quot;camping&quot; the spawn point, we will engage Ragefire if we have the force to do so first and the campers do not.  If those camping have the force there to do Ragefire, yee-ha!, good for them.  We will respect that as a camp.  It is really not complicated if you read, and this is nothing different than what many people said in the post started by LF that flamed us and which you so robustly joined in on.  At least stick to one story.<br>
<br>
Which brings me to Akheva.  WTF are you talking about? Make up all the stupid ass shit you want about Akheva to detract attention from how wrong you are.  I've never pulled mobs off anyone there or anywhere else for that matter.  I've never been there during a Landslide raid.  I would leave the zone if I saw that.  On the rare occasion I go to akheva, I go to one camp.  If it is taken I leave.   Oh wait, maybe I did pull all those centis with the really neat and uber weapons I just had to have for myself, greedy hypocritical bitch that I am.  Yea right.  Please try to come up with a better fantasy than my pulling mobs from you for a centi shortsword.  That is comical.  (And I will never learn a lesson from a jackass like you)<br>
<br>
What did you do to my guild?  You personally flamed us and called us liars.  Until that point I had no clue who you were personally.  What did Landslide do to IM in SolB?  Everyone knows that.  So take your self righteous know-it-all-crap to Legends and spare us the agony.  You have an opinion about everything -- which is of course, always miraculously right -- even when you are so obviously clueless.<br>
<br>
Am I crying about what happened today?  Not in the least.  I am pissed and my ass is sore from being fucked repeatedly by your guild and others.  You are the one spewing the &quot;woe is me&quot; shit, and I am playing my small violin for you.<br>
<br>
I have nothing more to say to you or about the training and KS'ing while a mob was engaged that occurred today.

one guys tried to Steal him yeah a nude guys rofl certainly one of u after been rezzed<br>
we was buffed and ready before anyone in the zone so we engaged and killed<br>
<br>
and about talendor let me laugh but we never got wiped we all was at BW zone waiting on mob but some stupid noob kept training him to us for some reason so we just zoned to BW waiting on call for kill him, u was in SF before us and if u would really kill him why just don t kill him ? cuz u wont or u don t have the fire power for him that s all then stop to hide u behind some lame lie and excuse.<br>
<br>

<br>
yeah 16 nude guy just rezzed i want to see that one day<br>
<br>
so now as i know from EQ i don t have to Engage a mob already agroed by some other ppl / group / guid or whatever.<br>
Nobody got agro from him when i engaged him for start kiting so i m not wrong not any other but us in the zone was ready for kill him so why do u try to flame or be rude with someone that make u happy ? go take a break man u have a serious problem.<br>
Really the only problem u have is with Verant they make this mob sucking to spawn in SF and not in nagy lair that s all that make him Like any outdoor dragon totaly FFA. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/usuccuba.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Succuba</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(3/30/02 6:31:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1158.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Ragefire</span><hr size=1> Yea right.  Rashka -- a RiP cleric -- had been sitting above RF spawn for the last 1.5 of the 6 days we were there getting, in her own words, &quot;pictures of the sunset,&quot; and RiP miraculously shows up just in time to see the dragon wandering around the zone?  Whatever.<br>
<br>
Anyway, now Yeugeo has someone else to flame for saying Ragefire is a FFA mob.<br>
<br>
And yes, Verant does suck.  Their &quot;fix&quot; of Ragefire has made it worse for everyone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uscratcha.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scratcha</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(3/30/02 6:48:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1158.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire</span><hr size=1> [QUOTE]i saw 1 guys from i ahve no idea and i don t take care about the guild, and i don t want to know cuz he was totaly stupid to try kite a dragon when u are nude  , this guy tried to over agro the dragon from me and died 2 sec later,[/QUOTE]<br>
<br>
that nekked flying kamakazi you saw, was none other than the fat white balloon called Scratchalot with an IM tag floating above his head...and when i caught agro there were a total of 6 RiP in Zone 6 CB, and 15 IM...and YOU were NOT one of the 6 RiP that i saw in zone...funny how that turns out...and about the 2 sec later dieing....ogres have more hp than that...and i kited him around for at least 5 minutes while waiting for people to get rezzed in...when i did die, one of our rangers resumed the kite so we could get our people back in<br>
<br>
thats all i have to say on the subject...have fun with your new epic Rashka, and i hope you got good shots of the sunset<br>
