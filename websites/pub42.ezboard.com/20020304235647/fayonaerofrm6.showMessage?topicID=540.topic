I've never witnessed a more sickening display of wretched personalities in any other moment of my adventures. Truly a window into the Everquest player's mind.  Scavengers ran rampant, begging to loot things. The textual (is that a word? If not ....now it is !)exchanges and whining ...the &quot;looking to loot &lt;insert class drop&gt; plz&quot; comments. So hard to have fun when your peers show they possess the integrity of .....I'm without wordssss. Some...not..having integrity thing. <br>
<br>
It was.....revolting. This is a &quot;nag&quot; to those who dwelt within the Rathe Mountain zone behaving in a fashion what would make the people who raised you ashamed. Made me ashamed to be playing a video game in proximity of you. <br>

But I'd have to agree, it was like, a nightmare. I, for the life of me, have never seen so many 'phat lewterz' in all my friggin days. EVERY shout or /ooc was for, Anyone have any _class_ loot?!? I need _class_ loot!!<br>
It was just pathetic. I and a group of friends were there for fun, I don't think we even looted much, if at all really.<br>
We buffed, we rezzed, we took on the big bad dragon construct guy, and it was fun. <br>
EK was a lot different, much more fun, with less beggers. People were frequently helping others to find nice things to loot, encouraging locs and such. It was fun too, with a quest involved that sent us running round the zone <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The aggro range on these mobs were HUGE.  They came in from everywhere.  They were all green, but came in mass.  Adds just kept piling up from what he said.  Beggers were swarming you as well creating a new type of train for EQ.  The train of corpse/loot/ninja campers.  My friends were fighting for their lives from the shear number of greens that were piling up on them.  Constantly fighting.  And here they have hand fulls of beggers swarmed about clicking away as fast as they could on all of the bodies... trying to get on the corpses and loot while you're busy with all the adds.  Not just &quot;asking&quot; if they can loot... trying to full out ninja right infront of your face while you try to fight back the mobs and stay alive.  Following you around everywhere trying to loot any corpse they can, even though you're standing right there fighting off the adds that these scavangers brought along with them as well as your own.<br>

My fiance did lose his life, and I took quite a bit of damage from a Cursed Evil Eye who snuck up on us and slammed us with force off the mountain.  I took over 800hp damage from the initial knock (wow I'm flying... backward... BLAM) and an additional 200hp dmg from bouncing.  Yes it did pay for it, and dropped a nice War only belt.<br>

I swear, after last night, I am NEVER EVER EVER EVER going to give anything to a shadowknight or ranger again.<br>
<br>
After running around in werewolf illusion in West Commons (and being chased by dozens of people, that was fun :&gt;), we decided to hit Rathe Mountains. My wizard friend has been in an advisor robe since back when they were still considered pretty damn spiffy. The tomato explosion robe dropping in Rathe isn't actually better, but at least it looks different, and it would make a nice souvenir ... Rathe Mountains was ugly. Between the beggars, revolving trains, half-thought out attempts to kill the Blood Reaver (I loved &quot;Everyone help me kill this thing! Oh look, I got hurt, nevermind I'm running away while it kills you. Thanks&quot;), people trying to kill level 65 cleric quest NPCs, and the huge aggro range of the magic immune blood drakes, it was a mad house.<br>
<br>
Lots of kudos to Sukoshi, Rathmar and Zommy for providing ressurection services. Sukoshi and Rathmar cleaned up the aftermath of a nasty reoccuring train at the Lake Rathe zone line, and I'm sure a lot of people owe them a couple levels worth of experience :&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Then we tromped off to East Karana to say hi to the quest spectre guy there, who despite being indifferent decided to attack the aforementioned wizard and proved to immune to root, snare, fear and mesmerize. Thank VI, I think I've never been so reminded of why I don't try to investigate quests anymore.<br>
<br>
Three zones over three hours or so, and I don't think a single minute past without someone begging for drops. Level 20 players surrounded by red mobs, druids begging for loot for their twinks, hordes of people running trains over groups and then asking what dropped, rampant accusations of KSing, and dear god &quot;IS THER NE SK LEWTZ?! CAN I LEWT TEM PLZ!&quot; until you screamed.<br>
<br>
Shadowknights, as a class, please exterminate your younger brethren. It's for the best.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
All in all, while I think the idea was cool, I really would have liked to see more &quot;toy&quot; drops instead of midlevel armor items. Candy bars with a few charges of Fay Portal or Ressurection, twinkies with charges of illusion wolf, noise-makers with a charge of summon: bixie, that sort of thing.<br>
<br>
Oh well, it was still fun :&gt;<br>
