the earth and humanity exsted LONG beore your precious Jesus, and to make yourself a martyr is an egoistic act since you take it upom yourself to &quot;fix&quot; the problem aka terroists kills 50 school children to show the world that there are poor people in uganda...  they dont see the suffering only the headlines they get, or compare Jesus to Hitler... He was a great leader otherwise all o germany and the major part of europe wouldnt have followed him and his gospel was complete bull and he was a great egoist the people still belived him and loved him for it..<br>
the point is you dont have to be right to have followers and infact i think a true martyr wouldnt have a single follower as he would never risk anyone else for HIS own cause (do you now understand the egoist part)<br>
He died he did this and that he and he again the translates to egoism, or idol´worshipping  and thats forbidden acc to bible right?<br>
(ponder weather crusifixes are idols)<br>
i Never said i belived in evolution since i belive that if we came from monkeys there wouldnt be monkeys today, BUT i have also never said to belive that God created mankind (not jesus he didnt exist then mofo) i said i Belive that IF there is - there is also + and in this case id say the south side cares more for humans no matter who created us...<br>

I really would like an explanation on that one.. <br>
<br>
Well for this first time in this thread I have to dissagree with Ytrok there... since if someone belives in God then he does exist.. to them.. =) If I walk around and belive in.. hmm Santa clause is a good example, then he does exist for me. But I get your point.<br>
<br>
I don't belive in God, I don't belive in Satan (kind logical, can't belive in one without the other), I don't belive in Christ, I don't belive in Amun Rah, I think this list could go on forever.. I don't have a need of something to belive in besides my self, others do and as I said before that's their choice and I respect them for it =P<br>

<br>
Ok people, lets see if i can explain this better this time.<br>
Yes, there was life prior to the coming of the Christ. Millions of years before.<br>
Before the fall of Adam and Eve from the garden of Eden, not Jesus, man didn't suffer from physical death . God's children existed without death in the pressence of Him. After their fall, physical death was part of the fall from paradise, and it wasn't until the atonement of Christ that we will be able to resurrect from the death, us and people who have died before and will die after us, and be judged in the second coming. Thus becoming immortal after the judgement, in our physical bodies. I didnt say Christ died so we can be mortal, he died for our sins and resurrected to give us immortality.<br>
He was not a martyr. He was commanded by his Father in Heaven. It was his mission to save the world he created and the children of his father. Christ did not begin exsisting the moment he was born into this earth, he is part of the Godhead (father/son/holy ghost). Christ is our creator, as ordained by his father. Even if you argue that a martyr is an egoist, that is a contradiction. Contradicitions do not exist in the real world, only in theory. So you can either argue he is a martyr or an egoist, it is immpossible to argue for both. <br>
Idolatry is against the word of God, and a crucifix is an idol. i dont worship crucifixes, that is one of the mistakes of the Catholic Church. How did you get to idols anyway? talk about digressing.<br>
Just by believing in something doesn't make it exist. I cannot prove to you by physical means that there is a God, however you can't prove otherwise either. In fact, there is nothing harder than proving something , anything, by physical evidendce, some philosophers say it is immpossible.<br>
I can make philosophical arguements to prove there is a higher being. You can make arguements to disporve it. I can use the Bible to prove His existance, as i can do the exact opposite. the Bible is not perfect as it has been accounted from different people's, translated from different ancient languages, and perhaps even manipulated for political means. Hoever the Bible is not the only sacred writing of God, or Jesus. We can go round and round endlessly contradicting each other, and you know what, we all find ways to disprove each other. What really matters is what you have faith in, what you believe, because we all have faith in something. From the Bible or sacred writings, to the instructions of how to build a house, to the lessons you learn in school. no one goes out to prove a science book or the instructions of a diy kit, you just do it, that is faith too. I know we dont think like that in everyday life, but think of how much around you was just told to you and you do not need to prove.<br>
There are many arguements to challenge the word of God, but there is a fact that is undeniable. we come from somewhere bigger than we can understand, we all as a universe, and something created us, because NOTHING COMES FROM NOTHING. Plus, whatever it is that created us has to have a conscience, because existance at its very base(not only of humans but of... matter) cannot by any means be an accident, i hope you at least agree on that.<br>
Please respond, i really enjoy this exchange of ideas, and nourishment of debate.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/utreistaania.showPublicProfile?language=EN>treistaania</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Regular Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/30/01 12:43:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=281.topic&index=85>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hmmm</span><hr size=1> im a tad curious..<br>
if nothing can come from nothing then who created God?<br>
this is just as dumb as to ask weather the hen or the egg was first..<br>
the beliefs of a higher beeing is very old and differs alot from culture to another but the beliefs in Jesus and God is relativly new..<br>
im from sweden and up here in the north we used to have our own pagan beliefs and those to had arguments on how the world and the humanity came to be and you cannot prove them wrong either.. Perhaps Odin is God, the thing with it is that everyone thinks the religion they belive in and grew up with is the right one and all the others are false and some religions go as far as saying that the false religions are Demon worshippers (jehovas whitnesses) the fun part is that where ever you go to study the myths and old religions they tend to have suited the people of the era's needs at the time.<br>
But humanity evolves due to the fact that we learn and pass it down generation to generation so after a while the needs change and so does the religion.<br>
Billions of people has died in the name of religion in history and they still do... <br>
its the year 2001 now and we havnt yet found out that all religions are in basic the exact same belief...<br>
1 a higher beeing<br>
2 explanation to how we came to be<br>
3 salvation from our sins<br>
 <br>
some people have a need to know why we exist and how we came to exist and i think they are the ones that need religion, and they make that perticular religion live since if there are no belivers there are nothing to belive in.<br>
that brings us to another part of this the word &quot;belive&quot; since thats all it is.. not known yet people wage wars over who belives in the right god or who belives in the right way in the same god.<br>
there is no right or wrong in belief since we arent exact copys of eachother we will interpret everything diffrently and make our own angle to it.. thats why there can never bee a right way to belive since whats right for A may be wrong for B.<br>
<br>
as i said i do not belive in evolution in a sense that we came from monkeys.. just cause there are liknesses between mankind and monkeys we dont have to have anything to do with eachother.<br>
<br>
now lets look at the word Sin..<br>
what is sin? and who was it that said that this and that is infact a Sin? yes Sin vary greatly where you are in the world and when above all, if you knew that wormwood was relaxing in the year 1200 you where evil but in the year 2001 you are educated.<br>
is sex sin or something beutiful? well some say sex pre marriage is sin , some say the female skin is sinful and that they have to cover it up.<br>
the point is that people set the standards and there really isnt a given right or wrong its the &quot;human way&quot; our rules we set up and then when we evolve we argue cause the rules dont fit the frame anymore.<br>
<br>
the quote i made &quot; all crimes should be treasured if they bring thee pleasure somehow&quot; is actually a very wise quote since there really isnt a better way to describe it,<br>
we say what it is a crime.. but we feel what we think is pleasure..<br>
i think the meaning of life is to make the most of it, and to make the most of it is really to pleasure yourself as much as possible because you live for yourself and no one else. (here is the all are egoists part)<br>
is murder wrong? YES we all agree to that but from what standards and why? who says its wrong and why?<br>
everything fills a purpose for somone and who are we to say that god forbids this and that when its infact we that sets the rules and standards.. is humanity itself God? perhaps it is and it should fit the picture alot better then the old bearded guy on the cloud in heaven.<br>
since all people are capable or both good and evil , infact we are dependent of both sides.. if there is no Good there can be no evil.<br>
<br>
each man/woman is their own temple and christian or satanist makes little diffrence since the purpose is the same apart from the polarity. + and - <br>
<br>
just so i dont make anyone dissapointed i will add a quote with the sole purpose to agitate..<br>
<br>

We would smile at all life dying<br>
We would cherish each and every moment<br>

<br>
As a born follower of religion and self-turned agnostic, I took it upon myself to view various religions and such, and i can honeslty say that everysingle one contradicts itself in one way or another.  There is no arguing that fact, which has always been my biggest prob with religion so i started taking the backwards route and see which religion had the least contradictions.  Im also a devout follower of all that is science so thats always influencing my decisions.<br>
<br>
So i started to look for the only religion that agreed with science...err maybe agreed is too strong...a religion that didnt openly oppose science.  Judiasm-been morphed to fit culture to much over time, Christianity-god(heh..) knows how much Christianity has opposed religion, Budhism-still makes no sense to me.  The only one that didnt seem to outright defy religion (and no, Im thinking of converting) was Islam, and my reason for that was the Koran(sp?) actually describes something similar to the big bang (along the lines of &quot;all of the heavens in skies were once a singularity&quot;) and black holes, as well as the end of the universe that Friday was talking about. If you dont believe me, ill call up a translator ive been talking to last year and ill site the verses <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
But then i had another realization..the Koran still talks about Adam and Eve, and how God was created from nothing, which have always been the too biggest/outright non-sensical facts which pushed me to atheism.  So my final decision, there must be some kind of higher power because according to the big bang theory, the big bang was pure energy converted to matter, like the opposite of a nuke going off, so where exactly did all this energy come from?  Still doesnt make sense to me...now im gonna end this before i confuse myself some more <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

A conscience.That's just logical&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Why does there HAVE to be an uncreated creator? A conscience? This is only LOGICAL if you limit yourself to the position that we were created by God, and that he was created by something, and that being was created by something else, ad naseam.<br>
<br>
If you allow yourself to look at theories outside of God as creator, you might have better luck trying to formulate answers to these questions. For example: perhaps we were simply CREATED by Nature. Nature provided energy, matter, and an endless supply of time. Combinations of these three ingredients provided the building blocks of life, as well as an habitable environment in which life could gain a foothold, and eventually thrive.<br>
<br>
The odds that we are here are astronomical. It's like we won the lottery to BE in a lottery, to BE in another lottery, etc., etc., and somehow won. We struggle to find answers to how we came to be here, and when they don't come readily, it's sometimes easier to simply assign it all to a higher, benevolent being. Someone watching out for us so to speak. For some, the alternative is simply too overwhelming to consider.<br>
<br>
There may be a God(s). I really don't know. I will say that I highly doubt it. For me, too many of the answers found in religion simply boil down to &quot;because I said so&quot;. Those aren't the kinds of answers I'm looking for. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uvibesjoker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ViBeSJoKeR</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/30/01 8:42:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=281.topic&index=89>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.jollyjokers.com/vibes.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmmm</span><hr size=1> I have to return to the part where I posted earlier that mankind only uses a small percentage of his mind and that if we would use it to our maximum ability we might turn into Gods (yes farfetched I know).<br>
<br>
If we would use 100% of our brains capacity then we might understand where we come from, I don't know if we want to understand...<br>

Can you imagine the impact on this world the terror that would become of it, millions no billions of people loosing their direction....<br>
<br>
All in all everyone here has posted to try and share eachothers opinions on religion and evolution and we will never succeed in convincing either party, we might convince individuals but never the majority.<br>
<br>
I just hope that the people here and the intelligence shown here will also be the same intelligent people we meet inside the game. <br>

I for one love really really love these discussions and I love to see people getting aggressive (in a good way) defending their position debating with passion about what we believe in and we all see that we can actually communicate together even if we dissagree.<br>

This easily shows that we use more than 10% of it. They also have a fair understanding of what parts are responsible for what. Just really depends on what level you want by 'figure it out'. The 10 percent remark btw goes back to the late 1800's. They did know quite a bit less then than we do now. <p>Qaman<BR>

its not the problem with the nets but MS dev has to adapt it to a system that takes up more then 50% of your computers power just to operate...<br>

<br>
Something I couldn't let go:<br>
<br>
The statement that the bible has changed a great deal over time to follow politics is completely false. <br>
<br>
In fact, the bible is remarkable in that it is virtually unchanged from its current version to vastly older versions. <br>
<br>
This is proved:<br>
<br>
A) At the ruins of some walled cities in the wilderness around the dead sea area(I believe, like I said i will go get details) inhabited at the time of the Roman invasions by a sect of hebrews who were trying to preserve their religious works(bible) from the invaders. Both their version and the current one are virtually identical.<br>
<br>
B) Dead Sea Scrolls. They support/verify things that are said in the bible.<br>
<br>
C) Other histories written by people in the area/time of the bible's writings (IE Egyptians, Sumerians etc) also support things written of in the bible.<br>
<br>
D Structural evidence from Egyptian digs that supports the Moses era story of no straw for brick building(as well as other non-written evidence)<br>
<br>
As I said, I'm not a religious person, from what I know of it the bible is merely a remarkably unchanged history book.<br>
<br>
It is simply curious that it is so similar to earlier versions(despite what a fewl of you are trying to claim- show me proof, as I can give numerous archeological tidbits to disprove your claim), as a document as old as this one *should* show alot of difference between the newer and older versions.<br>

We merely need that idea to cling to, it makes sense to man because we are began in birth and end in death. So we assume that is how it must be with all things. Themes Man made up, only because we are vain enough to believe that the universe functions as we do. As we see life. To think, that these terms, &quot;Beginning&quot;   &quot;End&quot;  all have to do with time, which is another idea we've created to explain what we need so badly to understand. <br>
<br>
&quot;Who was it's father? How old is it? When will it die?&quot;<br>
<br>
How can the world not be flat? The Sun is not a god? Egyptians made runways for aliens? Sasquatch? Loch Ness? The stones of Stonehenge originated where? Rasputin was killed how? Bermuda Triangle? The Holy Grail? Noah's ark was how big again?  Gabriel and Lucifer, a war in heaven? Hell and Hades? <br>
<br>
Yes, religion is just the built in need for us to understand &quot;why?&quot;. It's irritating to not know &quot;why?&quot;<br>
<br>
Religion is based on Dominion. Control. Now...what other force would need to use dominion? Ahh, yes. A governing body uses dominion.  Dominion is something man understands. Kings, Queens, Emperors, Husbands, Wives, Children.......Gods. Is it possible to think any governing body would think to use gods/religion in order to maintain order and control?<br>
<br>
If you really want to be open minded, you will accept that we all must define our existence. The reason is because we reach a point where we become aware of our mortality, and we fear the end of our own time in this world. (Your own belief becomes more powerful when more share your view, it's why some of you are so adamant in pushing your method of thinking to others. An..example of what you hate)We cling to hope, that there's something beyond more pleasant, something greater that we will advance to. The possibility of what it is is horrifying, we each are to an extent frightened because we don't know what's out there. What does man fear most? What he does not know. How does he contend with this fear? By filling in the blank space. Creating a reason for himself and his purpose. <br>
<br>
The politicians, the leaders of societies, knew to make use of this fear. Leaders manipulated the populace with descriptions of what was to come, how it came to be. They discovered they could control the way the masses thought by describing not only a rewarding afterlife, but a consequence for those who did not follow the &quot;right&quot; way. The &quot;right&quot; way, was the method the leaders thought a society should behave. Countless societies have been formed, countless gods, heavens and hells. The most effective means of rule, is to rule by a means that results in fear.   <br>
<br>
Myself, I do believe in the theory that we evolved from the ape (it's understandable for you to scoff, unless you are a scientist who has knowledge of such a process, you're likely offended that a race such as us derived from primitive mammals like them. It seems every bit as believable as an ark with two of every creature, or woman coming from the bone of man. )<br>
<br>
Religion is not a bad thing. I don't say &quot;you blind fool&quot; to the man who follows the teachings of Christ or Allah. I am happy for that man, to discover a positive energy that keeps him smiling day after day. <br>
<br>
That's what is important, after all. To find pleasure, and enjoyment . To grab hold of something positive, and let it keep you until your end comes. Do whatever you must, to control that fear of mortality. <br>
<br>
I have a feeling, that were we to one day answer the question of where we came from, and if there was or was not a god. If we were to discover what happens when we die, and why we were put here.....<br>
<br>
We would not like it, and the result within our cultures would be unpleasant. Sure....some would rejoice...yet<br>
<br>
Imagine the impact of devout believers around the world learning there is no god. Or the other way around. Religion A learns relgion B was right. Hard to stomach. Might make you crazed. &quot;All I've lived for is false ! Release the chemical weapons, Abib !&quot;<br>
<br>
So, while it's fun to speculate the existence of a god. Neither side is sane to believe either side is right or wrong. There's not going to be enough evidence to prove either side wrong or right. So tell it how you think it is, but don't be such a weirdo to believe your way is correct. You just don't know enough, regardless. There's not enough known to have an answer yet. <br>
<br>
I am not a religious man, but I do respect religions. You see,  I respect Order. We have two things that maintian Order. Laws, and religion. The Laws we follow in our societies teach morals that have roots in religion. So, thank god for that. <br>
<br>
I sincerely hope I havn't offended anyone, be there a friend in Norrath I have who is religious or named Abib.<br>

if you use 110% working with microsoft NET dev why is it still LESS effective and safe then the unix versions from the late 70s?<br>
&quot;<br>
<br>
Lol.... well first of all I'd suggest that you check out the watch lists for server vulnrabilities before you make a statement like that. Also, .NET has nothing to do with being NT, Win2k, Unix, Linux, Solaris, HPUX etc. My 110% remark is simply because the .NET platform is in Beta so there's not alot of documentation out there... no books etc. It's all about figuring it out yourself or asking on the beta mailing lists.  Microsoft personel have been extreamly helpful, however, wich as been a pleasant suprise.<br>
<br>
Second I'd love to compare a unix version from the 70's to a 2000 server today especially when it comes to business applications.  Tho I admit that current unix/linux has almost all the functionallity with less overhead than a Win2k server, the fact is that as a consultant I write for what my clients have.. not what I wish they had.<br>
<br>
Third, the .NET platform is heavly XML based.  What does that mean ? It means the result of my applications, especially the Web Services can be accessed and used by any opperating system out there that supports the ECMA XML standardized format. My server can now talk and exchange information with just about any other server or application out on the internet. My web applications are now compiled in machine code wich means it's faster than a CGI based program and are written now in pure language instead of scripting languages, and I can chose which language I wish to write my program be it C++, C#, VB, Delphi, Cobal etc because as long as it's supported by the .NET framework it doesn't matter which language I use.  I can write an application and easily put a SOAP  wrapper around it, another standardized format.  The .NET platform is a huge leap from the way we, as programmers and developers, do things... a HUGE leap.<br>
<br>
I'd suggest learning a little before taking pot shots at something you know nothing about ;&gt;<br>
