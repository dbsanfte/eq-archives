a long time.<br>

3% of the total gm/guide population play a necro.  That's low in itself but take a look at the data below and you will see that NO GM'S PLAY A NECRO AT ALL.<br>
----Yeah, they don't hate us.  They LOATHE us for some reason---<br>

Fippy recently spent time with the Game Masters and Guides of Norrath to understand whom these brave Protectors are, and from what parts of the world they hail. Fippy took much amusement from pointing out to Mennix that Halflings were barely more popular than Ogres! Looking at the Class information, it appears that Guides prefer to be Rangers and Warriors, whilst GM’s tend towards the extremes of Paladin and Shadow Knight, both wonderfully suitable careers for all-powerful GM’s. Here is what Fippy found:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>

<br>
In some situations, a guide needs a bit of hit points, so it makes sense to play a melee class as compared to a spell caster.<br>
<br>
I would be more interested to find out what classes they actually play on their own account.  THAT may tell you more about them.<br>
