The first rays of light penetrating a breach in the straw roof that had been constructed by some simple inhabitant. Outside the sun boiled the ground and the giant lake that fed the green palms lining its edge. No memories would come to his aid in thought; his mind was broken. Dried blood was spattered across his bare chest and when he moved he felt a tearing sensation at his side. <br>
He propped himself on his left elbow and reached to his right side, feeling his wait where a long slit in his skin was showing with a dull red outline. He took a breath and the pain felt like a knife stabbing him. He let out a small cry of pain, drawing the attention of a fisherman. The man walked in, a curious look upon his face.<br>
&quot;You are lucky,&quot; said the man, &quot;Most who suffered such wounds would now face their hereafter if it would receive them.&quot;<br>
&quot;Where am I?&quot; asked the man.<br>
&quot;You are in the southern desert, in the Oasis Sir Knight.&quot; Was the reply.<br>
&quot;Knight?&quot; he said, shaking his head.<br>
He had no memory. But now images returned and he began to recall small flashes. <br>
&quot;Who am I?&quot; He asked.<br>
&quot;Your name is either Donlan or Donnely,&quot; the man said, pointing to a breastplate. &quot;It is written in your armor, but damned if I can read well. Still, you are a lucky sort and don’t you go abouts runnin for a while. There be strange folk in these parts and you best wait till you can breathe better.&quot;<br>
&quot;Donnely,&quot; he said, &quot;yes, that is my name. Donnely McLeod. Where did you find me?&quot;<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; said the man, &quot;You seemed to find me, stumblin around and such into my camp here. Why you was lucky to find me home at the time; otherwise I woulda not been able to clean up your wound there.&quot;<br>
&quot;I offer my thanks,&quot; Donnely said, &quot;And I will repay you one day.&quot;<br>
&quot;No worries master,&quot; said the fisherman smiling, &quot;You just keep to your bed and this will be all in my care.&quot;<br>
Donnely thanked the odd man and drifted back to sleep. He began to have strange dreams that troubled his soul and they came to frighten him. But as soon as he woke, the memory was gone and only the fear remained. For several days he was cooped up and rarely ever saw the fisherman. After a week he felt he was strong enough to walk so he made his way outside the hut.<br>
The air was hot. The sun and sand were hot and even the trees were hot. Donnely hated the desert. He would travel for an extra week just to bypass the sand and the heat by way of the grasslands. All he now wore was a pair of leggings and a necklace with a symbol with a sword and three stars; the symbol of Marr and priesthood as a Paladin. He thought for a moment and his memory flooded back.<br>
His life was a glorious battle and he was a great commander. Armies had flocked to his banner in defiance of the Militia. He was ousted from the order after the cold blooded murder of a young man who spoke against Marr in a vain attempt to defend the Militia's actions. He felt his eyes grow angry upon that memory. But it was his life. <br>
His entire life was war and war without end. He had killed hundreds and when he had his army he killed thousands. He felt no pity for the young man. His heart was always trying to do good, but there had always been a black spot that infected him somehow. He lowered his head and sighed.<br>
&quot;Well hello kind master!&quot; said the fisherman as he walked up with a net, &quot;I see you be feelin better now? Well that’s lovely! I might want ta warn ya of the storm comin though. A big dry storm that whips up the sand somethin furious and you might not want to be here when it hits.&quot;<br>
&quot;Where do you go?&quot; asked Donnely.<br>
&quot;Well, there're some folks down further the lake that let ya stay in their inn if you pay a penny or so, not much mind you at least, but the walls are made of wood and stone so it’s a good place to bunker down should it get to bad.&quot;<br>
&quot;Thank you,&quot; began Donnely, &quot;I shall heed your words if I may. How long till the storm reaches?&quot;<br>
&quot;Few hours at the most.&quot; Said the fisherman, who now turned and began walking down the lakeside, &quot;You may want to hurry!&quot;<br>
His voice trailed off and Donnely stood for a moment. He rubbed his mustache and turned into the hut, pulling his tunic on and inspecting his ruined breastplate. There was a gash in the right side, mad by a small axe. He pulled the plate over his chest and connected the back plate. He donned the rest of his armor and found that he had no sword.<br>
He cursed and remembered it dropping in the sand somewhere. He moved out of the inn and moved to the door. Suddenly he stopped. He ducked behind the wall of the hut, hearing murmuring and feet walking in the sand. The murmur was a chant of sorts, and across his path there walked six stragglers, weather beaten, with torn clothes and mean faces. Donnely cursed to himself for loosing his blade.<br>
They walked to the edge of the water. Donnely stepped out and they turned to look at him. They ignored him and went back to their ritual. They fell to their knees and bowed to the lake. Donnely looked out across the lake and his riddle was answered. They bowed, not to the lake, but to a tall tower, covered in vine and standing solitaire upon a stone mount that rose forty feet from the lake. The tower itself was over a hundred at least.<br>
&quot;They watch them,&quot; said a voice.<br>
Donnely turned and saw a young man standing behind him, looking at the wandering, ragged band who now bowed.<br>
&quot;They call upon his thoughts to strengthen their powers so that they may take what they need from us. They will not heed you or see you until he tells them to.&quot;<br>
&quot;Who might that be?&quot; asked Donnely.<br>
The young man laughed for a moment then spoke, &quot;Their god. They have left their own path and go mad in his service. I speak of Innoruk.&quot;<br>
&quot;Ah,&quot; said Donnely laughing, &quot;A fake, heathen religion that only requires ignorance to become its scribe or elder.&quot;<br>
&quot;You have not been here before good Sir Knight.&quot; Said the stranger, &quot;And I shall show you what we do to them.&quot;<br>
Two more young men sprang from behind two thick palms and drew broad swords. One found the leader of the group and dispatched his head quickly. The blood spattered across the face of the next one, who stood and drew a sword to defend. His bowels were split open and his innards fell onto the ground from a quick slice. The talkative young man had swung a small tulwar and split him across the belly.<br>
Donnely was enraged. He grabbed one of the young men and smashed his gauntlet into his face, breaking his nose and causing him to sleep well. He grabbed the sword and began to defend the heathens, who still knelt.<br>
&quot;I cannot allow you to do this!&quot; he shouted.<br>
&quot;They wish it Sir McLeod!&quot; said the man. &quot;And you shall also when Innoruk blesses you with death to his realm!&quot;<br>
At that the young man threw back his robe and his body seemed to shred like paper as a new form pulsated inside him. Donnely watched for a moment and then turned, running down the slope of the lake. He ran for a long while until he came to the inn that the fisherman had spoke of.<br>
&quot;Kind sir!&quot; he shouted, &quot;Please let me in. I have mush money and will gladly repay you!&quot;<br>
The door opened and an old man welcomed him in. He walked to a room and found the fisherman. He told him of the experience and waited for his response.<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; said the old man, &quot;It happens every storm. That is why I leave to here before the troubles be startin up there.&quot;<br>
&quot;Then I shall wait here also,&quot; said Donnely.<br>
&quot;You mustn't, &quot;Said the fisherman.<br>
&quot;Why not?! Am I to be slain by the lunatics that inhabit these parts?&quot; shouted Donnely.<br>
&quot;You must not bring peril to us!&quot; Said the fisherman, now standing, his old demeanor fading, &quot;They are the servants of Innoruk! They will die in his service and wish only to feed his fast halls with souls every day!&quot;<br>
Donnely backed out of the door and ran from the inn. His heart raced and the wind began to howl. He did not know where he could run. Every step became harder to fulfill as the sand began to blast against him. The he began to feel a presence. He spun round, his eyes stinging from the sand. It was one of the young men, but he was hooded.<br>
Donnely drew the short blade that he had taken and watched the man stumble through the wind and sand to reach him. Now the wind was literally knocking him over; sand filled the joints of his armor as he tried to maintain his footing. Visibility was only a few feet, but the dark shadow of the cloaked figure drew closer. Then he came into sight.<br>
The figure looked slightly contorted, not moving but now stood oddly in the wind. Then there was a sound a bow snap and an arrow glanced off Donnely's arm. He dug into the ground and pulled the arrow up. He mustered all his strength and leapt towards the attacker who was loading another arrow to loose at him. But the man never drew.<br>
Donnely jumped on him and plunged the arrow deep in his eye. As Donnely did so he saw the dark skin and the pointed ear. It was a Tier'dal. The elf screamed loudly as Donnely pushed the arrow deeper and deeper in. Dark blood spattered from the wound, but he held on as the elf twisted and cried out. Donnely closed his eyes, trying to drown out the scream with a thought. He held the arrow firmly and kept stabbing deeper and deeper until the figure only shivered.<br>
He pulled out the short sword and aimed it for the heart, stabbing through boiled leather and cloth. It silenced the moaning elf and gave peace to Donnely. He stood, the sand searing his skin and burying his feet. But it was not over. He could see two more of the figures coming towards him. But behind them there was a more sinister shape.<br>
Suddenly, one of the men was lifted into the air. Donnely watched as his neck and left arm were separated from the rest of his body. There was a short scream and the other figure turned to see the grim shadow. But he wailed and screamed, falling to his knees and bowing. The long, slicing edge, swung down and pierced his spine, jutting out from his stomach below.<br>
Then the shadow came to Donnely. He turned and stumbled through the sand and ran for the palms that lined the lake. He fell down the lakeside and felt the cool touch of water. The sand still blew, but not as hard because of the steep embankment. He stayed cuddled there for a few minutes, seeing if he could hide from the foul demon. It seemed to work.<br>
An hour later he found himself waking. Finally, he gathered the strength to move and stood. The sandstorm had moved on and only a light breeze carried a thin layer of sand across the dunes now. Donnely crawled from the lakeside and made his way east, back towards the inn. Standing on its doorstep were a few men, including the fisherman.<br>
&quot;You!&quot; he shouted as the fisherman turned, &quot;Has all sanity fled my mind? Where is the grim specter of death that has tormented my soul these days?&quot;<br>
&quot;My, my,&quot; said the man, &quot;You truly are the lucky one. First an axe and now a sandstorm you have survived. And the specter of death you speak of is where you found him.&quot;<br>
&quot;Speak!&quot; Said Donnely as he strode up to the man, &quot;I have killed men and many men in my life. Where is death, but that I should wait for it and know it. For everywhere I go I leave death behind! What is this that has followed me and questioned my very sanity?&quot;<br>
The fisherman smiled, &quot;You have not believed had you good sir knight? You have never seen the foul beast that that this world has. There are terrors in this land that you know not. Terrors as wondrous and deadly… and yet you cannot believe.&quot;<br>
Donnely thought for a moment, &quot;How is it… How can it be that I was so blind? You have tricked me somehow into the truth.&quot;<br>
Donnely finally lost all his strength and fell to his knees. Blackness robbed him of conciseness as he fell to the ground. He was taken inside the inn and there they lay him upon a bed. For ages he slept, his head now peaceful and the frightful dreams gone. <br>
He woke later, his armor had been polished clean of sand and beside him lay a long blanket that was wrapped around something. It was long; five feet perhaps, but he knew that it was a sword. He opened up the gift. On the blade was a symbol… It had a sword and three stars, symbolizing Mithaniel Marr. He looked around and found that he was no longer in the inn. He was in a stone room of marble and he could hear the soft trickle of water. <br>
He felt now refreshed after his ordeals and stood, his bones cracking from sleep. He stretched and stood. He wore only a red kilt and a white shirt. He looked around for more clothes, but was unsuccessful in locating any. He walked out of the room into a larger room that was illuminated by a pale blue light. He walked over to a stone railing and bent over, surprised to find the bottom almost a hundred feet below. <br>
He suddenly realized where he was. This was the Temple of Mithaniel Marr. It was where the priest resided during their training. He walked back into his room and found a large stone door. He walked outside and felt the cool air of his home. He took a deep breath, but then he began to wonder on how he had arrived here.<br>
The voice of a greatly aged man came from behind him, &quot;The sleeping knight has awoken.&quot;<br>
&quot;Who are you?&quot; asked Donnely, not seeing any particular robe of rank on the man. &quot;How is it that I have come to this place?&quot;<br>
&quot;Do you not know me?&quot; said the immensely old man laughing lightly, &quot;Or has your head not ever healed?&quot;<br>
&quot;You!&quot; Donnely said shocked. &quot;The fisherman! How come you to be so old?!&quot;<br>
&quot;Time has passed,&quot; he said kindly, &quot;And you have now awoken to a new world. You fell into deep sleep and everything around you has become what it is now. Why, even the Militia have ceased such open war against us now, but it was a heavy price to pay to try and bring you here. Still, you have come and now you have awoken.<br>
&quot;Go now to the halls of Valeron Dunshire and there he will give you leave… or perhaps more. But in any case you have a new life, for in this you can be a new person perhaps.&quot;<br>
Donnely sat on his bed. He hung his head and sighed. He looked up to thank the old man, but he was gone. Donnely went back to the terrace, but no sight of the old man was found. He ran to the large room and looked, but the man had utterly vanished. Donnely put a hand to his head and felt the rays of the sun stream in his room through the open door. He stood and left the room.<br>
Standing on the terrace he watched the gardens; birds and squirrels and grass that moved slightly with the wind. He lost himself in deep thought and began to wonder about what he was. All things that were… had gone. He smiled and took a deep breath of air. Perhaps now he would find the peace in his mind he had so wished for his entire life.<br>
But there was a sinister shadow that lurked in the world and he turned his gaze south towards that dreaded temple in the desert. He was once a great knight and now he would return to his duty. He turned into his room and did not return to the terrace. Instead he left the temple and headed through the streets of North Freeport, his steps finding the path back to the place where he had once been disgraced. <p>"Bleating and babbling I fell on his neck with a scream.

<br>
Oh wait, my mistake ... chuckling ... how silly of me, you speak Common.  As I started saying ....<br>
<br>
I am Pleides.  I guess my story begins when I was but a wee child.  For some unknown reason, my mother apparently didn't want or couldn't handle me.  As such, I was given to the Temple to raise me.  I really don't know much of her; rich or poor, pretty or ugly, common or noble.  However, I learned from the Brothers that it really doesn't matter.  I am my own person.  Although I've begun to doubt that lately too.<br>
<br>
You see, I've found that I really haven't seen anything of the world outside of Rivervale.  And little of Rivervale at that, outside of the Temple.  I don't know anything about the *real* world, and I'm dying to know if my life has the meaning that I've been told it does.  I've heard tales from visitors to the Temple of the world outside, but I have to believe that most of them are exaggerations.<br>
<br>
Honestly, how can anyone believe stories of flying lions?  Or giant spiders bigger than those humans?  Or over large human looking beings, bigger than mountains?  It's just so inconceivable.  I know what you're thinking.  That doesn't mean what I think it means.  But it's true; they HAVE to be exaggerations.<br>
<br>
So, I have made the decision that I have to see the rest of the world for myself.  When I informed the Brethren of my decision and they saw my resolution in that, they have offered me assistance in my destiny.  They are taught me the secrets of their order: how to maintain calm in any situation, how to channel the forces of Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane's grace to help affect life here, how to act in the best interest of myself, the world, and, of course, in the best interest of Bristlebane.<br>
<br>
Armed with this new knowledge, I and ready to set out.  Easily, I find myself totally unequipped for this life outside of the Temple.  I don't mean physically; I mean mentally and emotionally.  So much turmoil and bustle.  How could ANYONE live like this??  I have spent the better part of this week wandering and just learning about my own home town.  After living here for so long, I'm amazed at how little I know of my own people.  And the STRANGERS!  So many.  So many kinds.  Tall, short, big, little, broad, thin, light, dark.  This an adventure in itself!<br>
<br>
Finding my way through the mountain pass that protects Rivervale, I enter the woods, as I begin my look into the world.  Dark and scary.  I almost turn back.  But that would admit defeat to Fizzlethorpe and to myself and my destiny.  And I can't do that.<br>

<br>
My mother, the charismatic Millea, was a bard of the highest cast. In an attempt to take out evil she joined with her brothers and sisters to raid the city of Neriak, the battle was long and bloody, the humans couldnt stand up to the power of the dark elves. Millea was badly injured and left to die by her fellow humans.<br>
    A dark elf necromancer saw her laying on the street and dragged her into his house in the third gate. He healed her wounds so that she would not bleed to death. He kept her as a maid for several years, and used her in anyway he could. Eventually Millea got pregnant and felt forced to tell her master, the necromancer couldnt come up with a solution, Innoruuk would not allow this.. so he threw her out, back to the street.<br>
    Millea went back to Freeport to find her family which she eventually did. She told them nothing about what had happened to her, but she was unable to hide her pregnancy, and her family got curious. When I was eventually born Millea tried to hide me away from the family, but the old woman who gave birth to me told Millea's father about my purple eyes and some other dark elf features which where unmistakable.<br>
    Millea was hung for her actions on the day of my 4th birthday. The family refused to take responsibility for me. But my fathers sister, Itera, heard the story about my mother, she looked for me and finally found me in the secret passages of Freeport. She took me to Neriak, where she lived after being banished from Freeport for the murder on a militiaman, and taught me the little she knew of my mothers proffession and mixed it with her own rogue skills.<br>
    The day came when I was old enough to take care of myself and leave the house where I had been hidden from the world. I sneaked out of Neriak, barely escaping the blade of Khazan Punox. I was a puzzled child, I did not know what to belive, what would be my way of life? The &quot;good&quot; had turned theire backs on me in my time of need. I was a outcast, not liked anywhere, the dark elfs had showed me theire ways, but they still did not accept me, I could not turn to them...<br>
    While wandering through the empty plains of Karana I caught up with a mysterious man, I never knew his name, but he calmed my stirred consience. He taught me an alternative way of life, the way of a Setite. I needed no one, I could take care of myself, if I only followed his ways and charished my fellow Setites. He took me to his crypt where he let me meet some others, I was puzzled once again, these were people of all races and crafts, and they all had the same beliefs? This must be the life for me, I was to become a Setite.<br>
    Now I thought that this was the end of my suffering, I could take care of myself, I knew what to do. Yeah right.. I was out hunting by myself one winters night when I strange dark elf suddenly appeared, I cant remember much more of the incident, but I woke up three days later knowing that something had happend to me. The following year I gave birth to my daughter, I gave her the name Set told me, Khemi, meaning Overthrower. I still do not know who her father is. She showed her arcane powers early and I did my best to teach her the way of a wizard, with alot of help from my wonderful wife, the dark elf wizardress Darka.<br>
    Now You know the story of my pityful life, I do not know why you should have this knowledge.. but my Master told me to share my life with the rest of you, so here it is.<br>
    As long as we are out there, You will be frightend, You will be corrupted, You will be sacrificed for Our beliefs. <p>Flexure Graverobber, 52 cleric -

And the races found here are hard races.  There is the usuall assortment of creatures, but there are also 4 races which are constantly at war.  Of all the creatures in the land of Kunark, these 4 are the hardest, and 3 of them are found nowhere else in Norrath.  They are the Burynai, The Froglok, The Sarnak and finaly, the Iksar's.  Once the rulers of the whole of Kunark, the Iksar empire was decimated by the Dragon Trakanon and his allies.  A race that once built towering statues for all to see, has been reduced to scraping out a meager existance in the ruins of one of their last great cities, Cabilis.  It is here that young Drakhnar, as he came to be called, was born....or rather, hatched.  He was an ordinary Iksar at birth but quickly displayed his prowess for the dark arts of Necromancy.  Indeed it was the path of a Necromancer that he later chose.  He was devout to the order and content to stay near his home, doing that which was needed of him by his masters.  Usually these were small, easily accomplished tasks, but one day he was given an assignment that would change his life forever.  Drakhnar was ordered to accompany one of the elder's in the order to the Tower of Kurn.  A wretched place and the source of unspeakable evil.  <br>
<br>
The morning of the excursion came, and it was quite like any others.  Drakhnar packed the supplies he would need, some bloodwater, a few bags of earthworm munch and some dried froglok legs, and his supply of bone chips.  He then set out to meet Elder Trassk.  Drakhnar found him deep in meditation atop the stump of a long since toppled, once great, granite pillar in what was now refered to as the &quot;Field of Bone&quot;.  No sooner had he arrived when the old necromancer decended from his perch and motioned for the youthfull necromancer to follow.  Drakhnar followed the aged lizard out accross the long dead resivior that his peers called, &quot;the pit&quot;.  It was a short walk to the Tower itself but it was not an easy one.  Drakhnar and the old necro had to be carefull of the various outcast Iksars that roamed the area.  However those few fools that did cross their path were quickly dispatched.  And then, there is was.....the Tower of Kurn.  Birthplace of the wretched Sarnak and the home to the Burynai Legion.<br>
<br>
Drakhnar and Elder Trassk entered the tower after asscending an unusually long ramp.  The inside was dark, and the scent of dust, mold and death itself slammed into drakhnar like a wall, almost toppleing him as it burned his nostrils.  Trassk was not so effected by this and on seeing his compainion keep his composure, Drakhnar quickly stood to full height and signalled to the Elder that he was ready to continue.  Trassk reached into his belt pouch and pulled forth a few small bone chips.  He threw them on the ground before himself and quickly chanted a spell.  A number of bones that were lying in the corner began to pull themselves together, centering on the few chips the old lizard had thrown on the ground.   Within seconds the skelletal form of a long dead Iksar had formed and was standing before it's new master.  Drakhnar followed suit and did the same.  <br>
<br>
The group proceeded deeper into Kurn's Tower.  Almost immediatly they were set uppon by a trio of &quot;unfriendly&quot; undead.  And almost as quickly those 3 were dispatched, the fragments of their bones were then gathered and deposited in Drakhnar's pack for use in the creation of future pets. Trassk turned to Drakhnar and spoke for the first time since they had set out on this mission.  &quot;Young one&quot; his voice rasped, &quot;I am here for one thing only.  You can have anything elsssse we come accrossssss.  Onsse we find that thing I sssearch for, we will be done here.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Deeper they went.  As they continued, the enemies that set uppon them appeared to become much stronger.  Soon they found themselves pitted against forces equal to their own.  But Elder Trassk pushed forth, and Drakhnar, bound by his oaths to the order, followed.  Onward they went, until the old lizard suddenly stopped.  A disturbed look passed over his face as he stared into the darkened corner of a room.  Drakhnar was about to ask what was wrong, but changed his mind and followed Trassk's gaze to see what the old one saw.  And there, in the corner, were the half rotted remains of what appeared to be another necromancer.  Trassk began to move forward to the corpse, and Drahnar began to follow, but was stopped short by the scaly outstreched hand of the old lizard, motioning for Drakhnar to wait where he was.  &quot;This must be it&quot; Drakhnar thought to himself.  <br>
<br>
As the old lizard approached the corpse, something out of the corner of his eye caught drakhnar's attention.  Quickly he turned to look, and found himself staring at the face of a Burynai necromancer who was beginning to weave a spell.  Rage spread over drakhnars face as he realized what the Burynai was trying to do.  &quot;NO!&quot; he shouted, motioning for his skelletal pet to attack the furry beast.  The Burynai must not have seen Drakhnar because the expression that covered his furry face could only be described as shock.  However, the foul creature managed to finish casting his spell before Drakhnar's pet could reach him.  Drakhnar heard Trassk hiss as the corpse of the fallen necro began to stir.  That hiss was then quickly turned into a gurggline howl of pain as the now animated corpse plunged a bone dagger into the old lizards chest.  Trassk reeled as his pet set uppon the walking dead.  Drakhnar quickly turned his attention to the furry beast which had caused this.  And with hate and rage unlike anything he felt before, he utterly destroyed his enemy, quickly turning his attention to the now animated dead and dispatching it with the combined power of he and the elder necro.  <br>
<br>
Slowly the old necro walked over to the again dead corpse.  It was obviuos he was in great pain.  With agonizing slowness Trassk bent down to pick up an old dusty tome.  Carefully he examined it and with a sigh, placed it in his pack.  Slowly he turned to walk towards the door, but instead his legs buckled and he fell to the floor.  Drakhnar tried to help him to his feet, but the old lizard pushed him away.  Instead, Trassk reached back into his pack and withdrew the tome he had just placed in there.   Slowly he pressed it into Drakhnar's hands and said &quot;Thisss I give to you.  Pleassse return it to our order.  If you mussst know about it, pleassse asssk one of the massstersss.  They will tell you.&quot;   Trassk then grasped the amulet around his neck and gave it a tug.  The tug was not hard, but it was enough to free it's bindings and make it fall free.  Trassk also pressed this into Drakhnar's hands and spoke.  &quot;You probably do not know thissss, but you are my ssson.  A broodling isss never told of hisss true parents because they are sssupposssed to think themssselvesss a child of the Iksssar rasssse.  However I have followed you in your life none-the-lesssss. And I am proud of you.  But there issss more to do.   That amulet will unlock my journal.  In it you will find the quesssstsss I have been on.  To you I leave all my belongingsssss.  If othersss challenge thisss, jussst sssshow them the amulet.&quot;   His chest heaving painfully, Trassk's voice began to waver, &quot;Go now.  It isss not sssafe for you here and you mussst get out before the Burynai'ssss friendsss come looking for him.&quot;   And with that, Trassk's chest heaved one last time expelling the very life from his body.<br>
<br>
Drakhnar stood in shock.  He was dumbfounded.  In a daze he made his way to the exit of Kurn's Tower and headed for Cabilis.  Even though his mind was flooding with the words that Trassk...his father, had told him, but he was also very curious about the contents of this ancient tome.  His curiosity piqued, he decided to find himself a place where he could examine the book in solitude.  <br>
<br>
Drakhnar wandered for a good hour until he found an abandoned crypt of some kind to the north of Cabilis.  There he sat in a corner and began to read the book, the only ilumination he had was the warm glow of a fire beetle's eye that he had brought with him.  He cracked the book open and began to look over the first page.  He was perplexed by the book's contents.  It read, not like a book, but rather like something that was meant to be spoken aloud.   Like a flash of lighting in the midnight sky realization spread across his face.  This was no ordinary tome.  This was a book of spells, researched by that necromancer!  Quickly he fumbled in his own pack and withdrew his own spellbook.  Hastily he began to transcribe the spells so that he could study them more in detail later.<br>
<br>
For two days Drakhnar wrote.  He was oblivious to the time or even what was going on outside of the crypt....his crypt.  He liked this place and thought it would make an excellent &quot;get away&quot;.  Finaly though, he was done.  Carefully he placed both books back in his packs and stood.  He had learned a new spell from the book he found.  The original author had called it &quot;gate&quot; and the description of it's use was something that Drakhnar thought he would find very helpfull so he had memorized it.  Quietly he chanted the words, and vanished into nothingness.  Everything went black.  For a moment he paniced, thinking he had somehow horribly messed up.  Then with a fluid ripping sound his world was once again filled with light and sound.  Drakhnar looked around, only to see the gazes of a few surprised guards who's group he suddenly appeared in the middle of.  Drakhnar, realizing where he was, bowed to the guards and headed for the entrance of Cabilis propper.  He had to return this old book to his masters, now that he was done with it that is.<br>
<br>
Drakhnar sat in his father's house.  It was not a big house, in fact, it was more like a one room shack built out of the ruins of a once magnificent building.  The care the ancient carpenter took in fasioning the very floorboards together was all but obscured in decades, if not centuries of dust and dirt.  Drakhnar sat and stared at his father's trunk.  He was hesitant to open it thinking that it's owner would return to claim it, though he knew this would never happen.  Drakhner reached up to the amulet now tied around his neck, and pulled it free.  Gingerly he placed it in the slot that it obviously was meant to fit in.  Nothing happened.  Puzzled, he looked at the lock and tried to figure out if it was rusted closed or something, but it was not.   Drakhnar then tried to turn the amulet to the right.  Still nothing.  Then he tried the left.  While he was turning, he pressed down on the amulet, and felt a sharp click.  Fearing he had somehow broken it, it quickly withdrew his hand only to see the lid spring up a few inches.  Carefully he retreived the amulet from it's place in the lock and began to look through his fathers things.  Among them were many differnt ancient and powerful artifacts as well as a number of different clothing items.  Drakhnar realized the wealth of his find and promptly discarded many of his items in exchange for these new ones.  And at the bottom of the trunk he found a locked book.  A book with a lock that was exactly the same as the one he found on the trunk itself.  Carefully he removed it from the trunk and opened it with he key.  There he sat, reading over his father's words.  <br>
<br>
Drakhnar's masters and teachers were beginning to worry about him.  They had not seen him in the last week and he had not showed up for any training recently.  They decided to find out what had happened and dispatched Elder Marsyk to find him.  They knew he was in the city somewhere, but they did not know where.  For three more days Marsyk searched.  He was about to give up and return to his masters when he got word of reculsive individual seen going in and out of the tunnels below the city.  He decided to investigate.  For another day he searched the tunnels.  Finaly he came across what looked to be a camp of some sort.  It seemed to be empty but the coals from the fire were still glowing and there were supplies gathered around.  The occupant would be back, and he would wait.<br>
<br>
Drakhnar had needed some more pieces of parchment.  He still had so much research to do.  Absentmindedly he wove his way through the long forgotten tunnels.   Only to suddenly stop short when he heard the crackleing of a fire.  He knew he had put the fire out before he had left and immediately became suspicious.  Carefully he withdrew his dagger and prepared himself to cast some of his newfound spells only to sigh a breath of releif when he saw his old teacher prodding the coals of the thought dead fire back to roaring life.  Elder Marsyk grinned at his student and said &quot;There you are young Drakhnar.  Tell me, why do you hide in these forgotten passssagewayssss?&quot;  Drakhnar grinned at his old friend and replied, &quot;I know who my father wassss.  He left me hissss possssessssionssss and I have been trying to learn all that he knew.&quot;   Marsyk leaned back and said &quot;Learning issss good, but you have not been to training for quite sssome time.  The Massssterssss are becoming conssserned.&quot;   Drakhnar sat across the fire, staring at it blankly, noticably deep in thought.  He breathed in sharply, then paused as if the words were hanging on his lips.  &quot;Yessss?&quot; Marsyk said.  Again Drakhnar paused, but quickly continued &quot;Teacher, I feel it is time for me to move on.&quot;   Marsyk, not seeming to be a bit surprised, replied, &quot;Young Drakhnar, you have much to learn, but I knew thisss day would sssoon come.  If you wish, I will return to the Massstersss and tell them you will be journying on your own for a while.&quot;  Drakhnar thought for minute then replied &quot;Thank you teacher.  I will probably be leaving for Antonica, asssssss the ssssoft sssskinsss call it, rather early in the morning.&quot;   Elder Marsyk chuckled, &quot;Be carefull.  You are but a broodling yet and there are many dangerssss in the world.   Mossst rasssesss do not like usss and will kill ussss, any of usssss, if they get the chance.   Keep thisss in mind.  Ssssoft ssskinsss are not to be trusted, but if you musst ssseek out alliesss, find the onesss called Dark Elvesss.&quot;  And with that Elder Marsyk stood, bowed and left.<br>
<br>
The next morning Drakhnar began his journys across Norrath. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=4.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=4.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=3><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.threadControl?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm14">Guilds<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm13">NWN & Morrowind<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Trash Bin<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Staff Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10>Roleplaying & GM Events</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
