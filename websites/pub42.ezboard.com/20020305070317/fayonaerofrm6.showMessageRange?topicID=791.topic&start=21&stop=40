At the very least, I would imagine he will be free every patch day. If he is still alive the next day, I'm sure someone will drop him, +Giant or otherwise. <p>---<br>

I think it's a little unreasonable to expect people to leave him up for a guild if he's not even your #1 target.  For better or worse this is a FFA server with a lot of spawn contention.  The best way to reserve a spawn is to hit that target on patch days.<br>
<br>
Having said that, in the case of Dozekar, there is no better time than the present for +CoV guilds to start bagging this guy.  He's about the only spawn with spectacular loots (granted not dropping directly) that lives for days after a patch.  After all once one +CoV guild kills him, I would venture to guess he'll be dying every patch day too.  When that day comes I guarantee the +CoV guilds won't be worried about the -all guilds - they will be groaning about the competition between themselves for Doz. <p>Reila / Ciryon<br>

It has more to do with the nature of what you are asking Palimax. It isn't, 'Let us have a shot at Doze', it is 'Please leave Doze up til we can get around to doing him'. These are very different things. Right now, he is always up on patch day and usually for days after that. Basically, I'd say if he isn't dead with a day of patch day, there is very little reason for complaint if someone else takes him, no matter what faction they are. We don't do calendars on this server, and that is basically what you are asking for here really. If you want Doze, just kill him if you can. But don't complain when he isn't up on Saturday when the servers were patched on Tuesday. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380>Qaman</a><BR>

<br>
Unfortunately, that's the downside to being on a &quot;FFA&quot; server.<br>
<br>
Also, the downside to there being so many high end guilds crammed into one server. Everything (Speaking worthwhile mobs here , and yes, opinions vary greatly on the term &quot;worthwhile&quot;) is dead in under 24 hours after patches these days.<br>
<br>
But, I also think LL said it best in his post. He stated EW does Doze once in a blue moon, for tears/drakes for symbols for those in the guild who have worked their asses off to maintain such faction. <br>
VV also does Dozekar, when there is nothing on Norrath to do, maybe once a month, if that. But, we also do it for the same reasons. To fulfill the goals of guild members who have maintained that faction for the guild/personal goals. These people deserve to complete quests, just as much as +CoV guilds. <br>
<br>
As it stands, and as many have posted, Dozekar is left alive longer than almost any spawn in Norrath. And he will continue to stay that way, I'm sure, until the CoV guilds start taking him down, or until CoV people in guilds need to finish a quest.<br>
<br>
But, whether a guild as a whole has faction, or individuals in a guild have faction, should not be a factor in &quot;who has &quot;rights&quot; to Dozekar&quot;. As much as that sounds harsh (and maybe it is), it's the way EQ and our server seem to work. <br>

You mistake Vision for another guild.  We engaged the &quot;mini-named&quot; mobs in HoT once, determined they dropped the quest pieces needed inconjunction for Dozekar and then never attacked them ever again (outside of some kludgy pulls).  As a guild we have perhaps 2 or 3 of the small quest items.<br>
<br>
We have no interest in the &quot;mini-named&quot; mobs until we're able to get Dozekar (much like we don't dick around with Wizard epics much as a guild unless we have a VS staff).<br>

We don't groan about our competition.  We're not groaning about this either.  Dozekar, and every other target in the game, is fair game to anyone who wants to kill him and has the muscle and coordination to do it.<br>

That's <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  not</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> what I'm asking.  I'm saying that when +CoV guilds demonstrate that they can kill him, I'm humbly asking that the &quot;other&quot; factioned guilds give the +CoV faction guilds a shot at him, and simply keep sight of the fact that there are other guilds on this server to whom Dozekar would be the BIGGEST feather they could put in their cap without a radical change of faction.<br>
<br>
I'm simply saying that we all play together on this server.  When the +CoV guilds are ready to take Dozekar down, leave them be at it for a while; let them (and me) take on the biggest +CoV encounter.<br>
<br>
...and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  yes</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I am coming to some of the bigger guilds on the server with my hat in my hands, with nothing to offer in return, to make a request about a situation I see happening in the FUTURE.  I've said please, I'll say thank you, and as always, I'll offer Vision's support to whatever reasonable requests your guilds make of us.  That's part of being in the same community.<br>
<br>
I'm not asking that anyone LEAVE him up.  Just when the +CoV guilds get strong enough to do him (which is soon), put Dozekar down on the bottom of your hit-lists.<br>

you prolly have like 3 days after each patch to set that up..  Im sure you could work easily within that timeframe<br>

I obviously can't speak for every +CoV guild, but that's all I'm looking for.

You shouldn't be able to kill in HoT without getting negative tormax and zek hits. I can understand why they don't give +cov or +yelinak--faction would be too easy and so would moving around if hot were factioned--but these mobs should all give heavy hits if you are giant aligned. It wouldn't make sense in the game context but it would solve a lot of problems.<br>
<br>
Yet another problem is that people without faction can easily help those who wish to take the time to rebuild there's do these quests. The faction itself is too easy to regain.  If your guild is doing tov they can probably do vindi and maybe statue...a day or 2 of this plus tons of arena mob hits and you can from max scowl to max ally without much fuss.<br>
<br>
<br>
But when you come right down to it the ultimate problem is that there are just too many people with too many needs/goals/wants/desires and too few mobs to go around. Someone's going to be left unhappy, unfortunately. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/udyschord.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dyschord</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/10/02 9:10:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=791.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Giant Aligned Guilds Hunting HoT. </span><hr size=1> Palimax, <br>

<br>
(Having an inane moment thank you ;p)<br>
<br>
FWIW, I do realize that the NToV hunters will be spending their time there first, as there is a lot of competition for the rewards that wing offers -cov and non-factioned guilds.<br>
<br>
Halls of Testing offers a guild the time to successfully learn about 'wurmhunting' without having to hone their skills on dragons which would affect their velious faction.<br>
<br>
It's true that Final Destiny are near the point where we will take down the beastie.  We have attempted him already, and with each encounter we get better. In the meantime we will be using our time in HoT to upgrade ourselves, both in armor and in skills.<br>
<br>
It's also of my opinion that once the +cov guilds can take him down with ease, non-factioned guilds will move him off their 'bored out of their minds' to do list (yes, that's a quote hehe) simply because he won't be up. <p><font face="Century Gothic" size=4 color=gold><b>Dashmoo</b><BR>

<br>
I doubt that anyone will be prioritizing Dozekar as a server up target by any guild currently able to take him down just because someone new on the block can kill him... I'm sure there are 5 or 6 guilds that can take him down right now, but he lives for days and weeks as mentioned earlier.  <br>
<br>
I'd rather not have to race for some other mob anyway, enough of that as it is.<br>
<br>
I am personally in with those who say to not classify a guild as +cov/+giant.  Any guild can kill anything they want regardless of faction, it just may take more effort by some, and those who want and time to exert that effort shouldn't be punished.<br>
<br>
I do see your point though; with a week spawn time, and a couple of guilds killing him once per month as they claim, that is half the spawns for a month, barring server downtimes.  The problem is there are a few exceptional items, even compared to Vulak items, that do make farming Dozekar and the other symbol dropping drakes worthwhile.  <br>
<br>
Where there is loot to be had, they will come. <p>_____________________________<BR>

Palimax &quot;seconded&quot; the post.  <br>
<br>
I am a member of vision..although what i say is representive of my views, not the guilds, until someone like palimax says that they do in fact coinside.<br>
<br>
The situation as it is now, is what I see as near ideal as possible.  The 3 or 4 +cov guilds that are close to being able to kill Doz are given 4 or 5 days after server patch to attempt him.<br>
+Giant guilds (or NTOV guilds, as people say +kael may now be an innapropiate description) look at the Doz spawn, and say no one kills him, so we can compete for all of the NTOV spawns untill they are all dead, and then sack Doz at the end of the week.  Why waste time on him when all mobs are up, when he will be up 3 days from now when no mobs are up?<br>
<br>
Soon, vision, redbranch, final destiny, (and knights?  i don't know anything about them) will be killing Doz.  Realistically, i would not expect him to stay up for more then 3 days before a +cov guild kills him.<br>
<br>
The concern here is this:  When NTOV guilds that kill Doz late in the week see that he is being killed within 2 - 3 days of spawning, by +cov guilds, they may put Doz higher on their priority list, and start killing him on (for example) day 2 after server reset, instead of day 4 or 5.<br>
<br>
Palimax (and i by that matter) are just asking that when the 3 or 4 +cov guilds start killing Doz, please do not start killing him on day 2 after a respawn.  Please continue to kill him on day 4/5/6 after respawn like you have been doing.  <br>
<br>
The current situation allows vision sufficient time to make an attempt or two (if we get there first), and then final destiny (if they get there second, and if we fail) an attempt or two, and red branch (if they were to get there the 3rd day after respawn) an attempt or two, before the NTOV guild kills him.<br>
<br>
We are just asking that when NTOV guilds see + cov guilds killing doz, they continue to keep him on his current spot on their &quot;list of targets to kill&quot;, and not to escalate him to the day 1 or day 2 target list.<br>

I just want to underscore what happens when Dozekar gets killed.<br>
<br>
Right now, the guilds that are on this server still need to maintain their +CoV faction.  Our targets are very limited.  Until we can be done questing (as a guild) in Skyshrine, we have a VERY small pool of large target mobs to attack without massive faction work.  (Dragon hits are MUCH MUCH larger than giant hits.  --  If you're max allied to CoV, kill a +6 dragon and then count the number of giants you need to kill to repair it.)<br>
<br>
We're not asking anyone to not kill Dozekar.  We're just asking that the guilds with a larger pool of targets to choose from be considerate of those of us with a limited pool of things to choose from*.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> [*Yes, we might have handcuffed ourselves going +CoV, and moreso, by STICKING to +CoV, but for the time being most of us ARE stuck...]</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Anyway, this is beat to death.  Dozekar was up last night while we were in ToV.  He'll probalby be up when our scheduled attempt to kill him happens.  (We're hoping he WON'T be up afterwards...) <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4868>Palimax Sceleris</a>,

Vision is definately a +COV guild at the moment. Occasionally, good dragons go bad to the point that we have no choice but to duel them.<br>
