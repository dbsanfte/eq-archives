Indeed, truth is not subjective, however in its entirety it is not available to us.  And when you get down to the submolecular level it is almost entirely unpredictable.<br>
<br>
Do we need this much pain and suffering to know good and love?  Do we need ebola, cancer, mental retardation, profound schizophrenia, natural disasters that wipe out a million folks at once, etc etc to put in perspective human altruism and affection?  I think we'd feel goodness and love just as well without 3 million folks dying of AIDS every year.  No need for this divine overkill.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;The Bible is the word of God. Jesus Christ is your savior.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
The Qur'an is the word of God.  Mohammed is his greatest prophet.<br>
The Book of Mormon is the word of God.  Joseph Smith is his greatest prophet.<br>
The Avesta is the word of God. Krishna is your savior.<br>
If you are not a Jehovah's Witness you will be annihiliated.<br>
One could go on an on with such claims.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;However the Bible has been translated incorrectly because of the transgressions of men.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
So some folks a thousand and more years back screwed up and all of us in the present day suffer for it?  (This applies to Original Sin as well).  <br>
<br>
What anger, Thuram?  I'm a happy guy.  I find it funny that hardcore believers still try to pass this babble off as some sort of evidence that their beliefs are the Ultimate Truth.  Besides, I've never witnessed such anger, hatred, and ill will as that of the True Believer for a fellow man with different views.  Illiterate, foul-mouthed threats of Hell and damnation are all too common (mainly among biblical literalists, not the more open-minded folks such as Lleauric).<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;I know this to be true&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Just as every Muslim knows Islam and the Qur'an to be true, every Mormon knows their beliefs to be true, every JW knows they are right, etc etc.  <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Complete happiness is the will of the Lord for you, and in servicing the Lord and your fellow man you will find it if you dare accept that we live in a world of trials.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
No need of a god for happiness, and I find your claims indefensible.  Quite a few folks never reach the age of 2 in their search for complete happiness.  <br>
<br>
Yes, Lleauric.  <br>

<br>
<br>
I am Mormon, and the book of Mormon doesn't have Joseph Smith as its core, neither does it state that it is the only truth, but a companion to the Bible, because the bible has been misinterpreted and modern revelation exists today. The center of the Church of Jesus Christ and latter day saints is Christ.<br>
<br>
I am also a Biotecnology Major, and i have no idea qhat you are talking about when you say that at a submolecular leve there is no truth. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Our body at a molecular level is the most perfect and harmonious thing we have on earth.<br>
<br>
Do we need all those disasters to know truth? Im not sure, but i do know that the Lord Isn't the one inflicting those, because as you kindly pointed out he gave us free will and a lot of those are created by men, either directly or by transgressions one way or another.<br>
<br>
Lastly as I've pointed out on this board before, Philosophically we have a need for a God, because the univerese and matter and energy HAD to be created by some entity at some point with a conscience, and this entity must be benevolent/omnipotent/omniscent. That is just a fact. Sorry if you hadnt thought about it or don't accept it.<br>
<br>
And I was baptized catholic catholic when i was born, and i didnt follow any church until i became 20 years old. I can see why a lot of people are repeled by religion. Politics within major churches have screwed up bigtime in the past, but that isnt God's fault, we were the ones making the decisions. When you say &quot;wuold God allow all this atrocites&quot;.. well yes absolutely, it is called FREE AGENCY. Helping us out at every step that we failed as humanity would be contraproducent for our purpose here. Just remember that God IS your father , and that he has a plan for us. Even though we dont understand it fully or have every answer doesnt mean we shouldnt strive to fullfill our part. You should know truth, why wouldnt it be your role to know it WIl?<br>

The existence of virtual particles unpredictably popping in and out of existence demonstrates the ultimate randomness of the universe.  As for the human body being perfect and harmonius (whatever that's supposed to mean), I disagree.  It's fascinating on many levels but essentially grows and decays like any other organic matter out there.<br>
<br>
So, you say the lord isn't inflicting diseases and natural disasters on humanity.  Right.  Indeed, you suggest that somehow man is responsible for &quot;ebola, cancer, mental retardation, profound schizophrenia, natural disasters&quot;.  Care to back that up?  (Note, transmission of a disease is irrelevant here; I'm speaking of origins).<br>
<br>
I don't recall ever stating anything regarding man's free will.  Indeed, all signs suggest the free will is an illusion; this is particularly true regarding belief (doxastic voluntarism).  Chances are that if you were born in Saudi Arabia you would be Muslim, Hindu if born in India, any of several possibilities if born in Japan, etc.  Spiritualism is thus more dependent on demographics than revelation.<br>
<br>
No, we have no need for a god, and the universe did NOT have to be created by some entity as you describe (which, in turn, was created by...what?).  The universe could have been created by purely physical processes (which have been described via several theories).  Given the &quot;cruelty&quot; of the universe, it certainly need not be benevolent (a trickster god such as Loki or Coyote would fit just as well or better).  How is time &quot;created,&quot; since action itself requires a passage of time from inaction to action?  And, of course, who created the creator?<br>
<br>
Another problem:  If your creator is both omniscient and omnipotent, then at the precise moment of creation it knows precisely all that will happen, beginning to end, and all the choices that will be made by sentient beings under its creation.  Because of this, the creator has created the entire chain of causation from start to finish. Ergo, there is no free will.  That is just a fact. Sorry if you hadnt thought about it or don't accept it.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;When you say  &quot;wuold God allow all this atrocites&quot;.. well yes absolutely, it is called FREE  AGENCY.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Precisely how did FREE AGENCY result in cancer?  Profound schizophrenia?  Hurricane Mitchell and the 10s of thousands left dead in its wake?  How does FREE AGENCY result in 20% of pregnancies resulting in miscarraige?<br>
<br>
No, there is no reason at all to believe in your deity.  It has as much justification as Odin, Isis, Brahma, Moloch, Bel, Etnu, Zeus, etc etc, and your excuses regarding a fallacious bible are just as easily applied to any other holy book ever written.  &quot;The Avesta is the true word of God!  It's just been corrupted by man's sin.  If you seek to understand its hidden meaning you'll realize it's the Truth!&quot; <br>

Most systems of ethics do indeed suck a lot.<br>
They are based on<br>
a) The need to keep people down in order to control them.<br>
b) &quot;Traditions&quot; based on past ages leaders need to keep people down in order to control them.<br>
c) Ideas that was once justified but are now obsolete.<br>
<br>
The &quot;ethics&quot; typhically associated with religions are typically loaded with all three of these. This doesn't mean that you have to have sucky ethics just because you are religious however. It's fully possible to reject all the dogma about sin as dark age garbage from a opressive church, and decide that the golden rule is the one true ethic principle of the faith.<br>
<br>
That's one thing that irks me, btw. Christians who think they gut some kind of monopoly on the golden rule, that their Jesus &quot;invented&quot; it. In reality, the idea that you should treat others as you would like to be treated yourself exist in all cultures,. The anicent greeks and chinese wrote it down long before Jesus was born.<br>
<br>
On the whole, I think religious faith should be kept separate from both science and philosophy. If there is a god who reward good behaviour, well, good for the people who behave well. It doesn't tell us about the nature of goodness itself. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

That sounds more theoretical than any scritue Ive ever read, perhaps because quantum theory just like chaos are philosophical unproven theories. Maybe you would care to point me to the experiments where it was proven that mass dissapeared.<br>
<br>
When you explain that &quot;my&quot; Lord is infact inflicting disease by negating my statement that he doesn't, are you implyig that he exists and is cursing us? Sorry, I think you contradicted your whole arguement right there.<br>
Anyway, of course I don't know about every origin of every disease you listed, maybe you will illustrate us. But I do know that some of those like ebola or even AIDS where animal diseases, that the people in africa came constantly in contact with until it mutated to a strand that was able to use their cells as hosts. Cancer and schizophrenia? Well those are genetical mutations as well. Maybe if people lived cleaner lives and we stayed off the course of radioactive waste which is has been dumped just about anywhere (including bombs) we wouldn't have such an outbreak as we have had this century. Also you may want to wonder how many of all mental diseases are just misdiagnosed, there's a lot of that these days. Natural disasters are just weather and tetonic movement, our influence on those exists, but I honestly don't know to what extent. Has nothing to do with atrocities. <br>
<br>
I could instead point out all the atrocities perfomed directly from man to his fellow, but they are so many, and im sure we are all aware of them. All of them transgresions by sin.<br>
<br>
<br>
About free will I was responding to someone a few replies back. But, it just seems to obvious to me that we do have free will, that im surprised you would say we don't especially considering your arguement. Like  you pointed out chances are that if I had been  born in India I may have been hindu, but the sole fact that there is a chance that i wouldnt be supports free will. Social structure does not undermine free will. But, if there is no free will and no God, then predestinate us? You have some explaining to do.<br>
<br>
We do have a need for a God, because nothing comes from nothing. Very true that we don't know what originated the creator, but at some point there had to be an origin of matter and energy and because we cant undrstand that there is a need for something out of time and space in our concept of these that created the first. True that it doesnt have to be necesarily &quot;my&quot; God, but maybe you would like to expand on your theory also.<br>
<br>
The Lord does know everything that will happen from beginning to end, that doesn't mean that he will ifluence directly because he can. That would negate creation wouldnt it? But you have to understad that our creation and our lives here werent created for his malice. Because he is omnipotent he created his breed, us. Because he is benevolent he gives us free will, which you say doesnt exist so somebody out there (note: not God) not only knows what you will respond to that but he determined it would happen, right? Anyway my point is this dispensation was created for us to learn about life, for our benefit, even if the Lord knows what will happen that is not the point. Have you ever seen a child not listen to his parents advice and screw up? Yeah, that's how you really learn isnt it, with no catcher in the rye.<br>
<br>
That is how and why free agency results in abortion and cancer,because we are not perfect and we fuck up, but we learn directly or indirectly from it. Oh and if you knew anything about the anatomy of the menstrul cycle and the hormones involved and pregnancy you would see how low 20% seems for miscarriages after all the conditions that need to be met to sustain a pregnancy. Learn some biology dude.<br>
<br>
<br>
Because I have thought the same things you arise and have questioned them and have seek to answer them is why i have a faith. Being in your position is so much more depressing and existentionalist too. Ive been there, done that. Join the righteous man, it feels good to wear the holy underwear.<br>

I should mention that the effects you're looking for, like a pencil not dropping to the ground, are on the macroscopic level.  The chances of the billions of particles cooperating in such a way are--while nonzero--extremely small, which is why we have not observed it.  However, if you look on a much smaller scale, the probabilities of similar events increase to the point where we can observe them (if indirectly) on occasion.<br>

In fact the human body could live forever if the gene for telomerase (p53 i believe) was not disabled at some point in early development. You see aging is caused directly by the nipping out of teomeres and ultimately coding DNA on each cell cycle of each cell, which cascades over to tissue then organs and finally the whole organism. What the telomerase enzyme does is fill in those gaps of nipped out telomeres so that w dont run out of them as we get older. In fact that is precisely the mutation that makes a cancerigenous cell malignant, the reactivation of the telomerase gene, because then the cells live forever. <br>
<br>
So the body doesnt simply decay nor is cancer just a simple glitch, its more evolved than that, and actually or bodies could go on forever if it wasnt for that so far unexplicable deactivation of that particular gene. My personal opinion is that we are geared to pass on, because our purpose is not to be here forever. IT would be really intersting to see someone try to eplain the telomerase phenomenon as the evolution of primary cells in a chaotic universe with no divine touch. Although Darwin made some huge improvements, i believe his theroy remains unfinished.<br>
<br>
I dont see right away the diference between what can be known and knowing everyhting, maybe you could point that out for me please. I do know that our necessary higher being, whether it is Christ, Buddha or a cloud of inexplicable energy knows tings out of time and spance, because he is likely to exist out of both of them.<br>
<br>
I also wanted to point out that while quantum theory is a mathematical line of thought, a lot of modern philosophers believe that the universe is becoming ever more organized, some even say to the point that one day we will be able to predict the investing market!! hehe well although i dont think itwill get to that the point is they are steering away from chaos.<br>

<br>
You entirely misconstrued my argument.  You claimed that the universe is incredibly orderly.  In bringing up quantum mechanics I show that the very foundation of the universe is not.  Virtual particles randomly appearing, disappearing, and moving about in time are a part of quantum theory.  Experimentation lends credence to their existence (such as it is).  I do almost all of this from work so don't have references to offer.  &quot;Atom&quot; by Isaac Asimov and &quot;In Search of Schrodinger's Cat&quot; by someone else both come to mind as general references.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;When you explain that &quot;my&quot; Lord is infact inflicting disease by negating my statement that he doesn't, are you implyig that he exists and is cursing us? Sorry, I think you contradicted your  whole arguement right there.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Come now, you can't be serious.  You describe a wonderfully benevolent god that does no ill.  I am stating that IF this god you believe in exists, then why do we see such high levels of unnecessary suffering due to non-manmade illnesses and natural disasters.  This is commonly known as the Argument from Evil (one version of it anyway).  There is no contradiction.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Anyway, of course I don't know about every origin of every disease you listed, maybe you will illustrate us.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
As someone involved in biotechnology I'm sure you're aware of commonly accepted scientific theories in this regard, if only from the perspective of evolution.  You keep trying to imply that man is responsible for all the ills of the world, but it just doesn't hold up.  So what if cancer and schiz (which existed quite some time before A-bombs) result from mutations?  We are, according to you, made by god (in his image).  An omnipotent and benevolent god should be able to make us proof against such suffering.  An omnipotent god should be able to construct a planet for his creation that will not produce natural disasters that kill millions and lead to the suffering of millions more every year.  You're whacking at straw men without dealing with the real point I'm making here.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;I could instead point out all the atrocities perfomed directly from man to his fellow, but they are so many, and im sure we are all aware of them. All of them transgresions by sin.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
My argument has nothing to do with man's acts against man.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;About free will I was responding to someone a few replies back. But, it just seems to obvious to me that we do have free will, that im surprised you would say we don't especially considering your  arguement.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Years ago I took a course focussed solely on the free will vs determinism argument.  I batted hard for the free will view (hey, the idea of &quot;choosing your own adventure&quot; through life seems kinda nice).  I lost.  Damn.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; Like you pointed out chances are that if I had been born in India I may have been hindu, but the sole fact that there is a chance that i wouldnt be supports free will.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Not exactly.  India has members of quite a few faiths living there.  You could end up Sikh, B'hai &lt;sp?&gt;, Hindu, Muslim, Christian, etc.  Also, free will is more complicated than choosing which pair of socks you put on today.  I'm no expert on arguments for doxastic (in)voluntarism (do we choose our beliefs), but the general opinion in philosophy is that determinism factors more in our lives than most people think (or want to think).  My major point, though, is that demographics, not revelation, is the major player in determining religious belief.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Social structure does not undermine free will. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I imagine there are a lot of poverty stricken folk who would like to will themselves into a higher socioeconomic bracket. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;But, if there is no free will and no God, then predestinate us? You have some explaining to do.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Remember, throughout all this we're mainly dealing with a theistic belief system (in this case yours); my views aren't so much the topic of discussion.  You've stated such and such is the case, and I'm showing why it isn't.  Keep in mind that I don't necessarily believe our lives are determined.  I know that a great deal is determined simply by genetics, raising, etc, but I like to think that we can make some choices.  Hmm...it's really way too complicated to mess around with here; maybe make another thread on it?<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;We do have a need for a God, because nothing comes from nothing.&gt;&gt; <br>
<br>
Just what is &quot;nothing?&quot;  Scientifically (and philosophically) that word has no meaning.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;...but at some point there had to be an origin of matter and energy and  because we cant undrstand that there is a need for something out of time and space in our concept of these that created the first&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
What does &quot;outside of time and space&quot; mean?  I'm not sure, but if there was an entity there I'm pretty certain that he wouldn't be doing much.  To be outside Time means you cannot initiate an action (such as Creation), since that would require a flow of time from inaction to action.  Besides, your statement is an Argument from Ignorance (because you can't understand how the universe could be created via naturalistic means it must have come from supernatural means).<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;True that it doesnt have to be necesarily &quot;my&quot; God, but maybe you would like to expand on your theory also.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Well, I don't really have a personal theory.  Scientific notions on How It All Came To Be are kind of complicated.  Was it quantum tunneling?  A singularity that moved from near timelessness to fast forward?  I don't know; I leave it to the scientists to figure out (and I know there is a chance they never will).  <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;The Lord does know everything that will happen from beginning to end, that doesn't mean that he will ifluence directly because he can. That would negate creation wouldnt it?&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Well, it wouldn't negate it; it would just mean the deck was stacked from the beginning and the Calvinists are right.  You're either Elect or born to fry.  Remember, by your words &quot;the Lord&quot; not only knows what will happen but also made it to happen that way.  He is an omnipotent &amp; omniscient Creator (as you would have it).  He knew what creation would be like before, during, and after the process, thus stacking the deck.  Also, if he is described as omnipresent (as he often is, and I think this is covered by omniscience anyway), then one of the common reasons for the Creation is nullified.  God not only knows everything that will happen to us, but by the attributes usually ascribed to him he is already experiencing it.  <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Anyway my point is this dispensation was created  for us to learn about life, for our benefit, even if the Lord knows what will happen that is not the point.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
But what is the point of us learning about life?  Especially when so many of us, through no effort on the part of man, do not get to learn about life due to premature death or mental incapacitation?  Why bother with any of this?<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Have you ever seen a child not listen to his parents advice and screw up? Yeah, that's how you really learn isnt it, with no catcher in the rye.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Except that a good parent's advice is clear and to the point, not thousands of years old and subject to 1000's of varying interpretations.  And yes, you will blame mankind's sins for all that (especially in regard to the bible).  But why should we suffer today for things done by others millennia ago?  <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; That is how and why free agency results in abortion and cancer,because we are not perfect and  we fuck up, but we learn directly or indirectly from it.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Err, explain how free will results in cancer again?  Leave out known man-influenced factors like smoking and sunbathing.  How did one of my professors, via free will, acquire and die -- quite painfully -- from pancreatic cancer?  What did he learn from this?<br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt;Oh, and if you knew anything about the anatomy of the menstrul cycle and the hormones involved and pregnancy you would see how low 20% seems for miscarriages after all the conditions that need to be met to sustain a pregnancy. Learn some biology dude.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Cute.  Learn the difference between a theological argument and a scientific one, dude.  You insist that god has certain attributes, including benevolence and a desire for his creation to grow and learn.  I point to numerous miscarriages as yet one more reason why your theistic view fails.  This isn't about how incredible it is that only so many miscarriages occur; it's that they happen AT ALL (especially give your view of the human body as &quot;perfect in its harmony&quot;).<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Because I have thought the same things you arise and have questioned them and have seek to answer them is why i have a faith.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Because I'm interested in knowing real answers &quot;faith&quot; is not an option.  It is a catchall answer when you have no answers or don't like the ones staring you in the face.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; Being in your position is so much more depressing and existentionalist too.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Depressing? Maybe for you; like I said, I'm a happy guy.  Depressing for me would be going to Heaven while good people are shut away in hell for all eternity simply because they wanted some evidence.  How could any person of conscience enjoy such an afterlife?  Sure, my way can be pretty tough, but I refuse to wrap myself in a fantasyland to escape real world woes (btw, is EQ back up yet? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; Ive been there, done that. Join the righteous man, it feels good to wear the holy underwear.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
One need not be theist to be righteous.  Indeed, in many cases that holy underwear contains nothing but the skidmarks of Evil.  How's that for a metaphor?<br>

I think I can partially answer this one:  Original Sin.  In the Garden, man's body was perfect and he knew neither disease nor death.  After being exiled man began to suffer both.  <br>
<br>
Like I said, its only a partial answer... all of man suffers because of the original sin.  So even though diseases and natural disasters are not man-made, you could say (from a Biblical standpoint) that they ARE man-caused.<br>

He was Married for 3 years.  One day his wife got sick.  She was diagnosed with terminal Stomach cancer..   Slowly..painfully.. his beautiful wife deteriorated before his eyes..  in the end for the last 6 months he couldnt take care of her alone anymore.  He took her into a hospice.  He was there everyday, as much as he could when he wasnt at work paying the bills, sleeping there, holding her hand.  She didnt even recognize him at the end, yet he kept coming.  And she died.<br>
<br>
It was so goddamn hard it prolly aged him 40 years.  He was 27 when this happened.. he could have just cut the ties and moved on..  nobody would have blamed him.  he was still young.. no children.  But he didnt.  Why?   He'll tell you it was becuase of his faith.  He made a promise before God, for better or for worse, in sickness and in Health.  And his faith gave him the strength to be there and be there for his wife.<br>
Love, Faith...<br>
What is in YOU that makes you keep promises that are difficult to keep?  What is Love to YOU.  Is it some reaction of Chemicals on the brain causing the illusion of deep emotion?  Dont ever tell me that, I reject that.  I know what world I live in.  Its the world where a man like this exists. <br>

To a atheist there is no motivation besides self interest.  Why should there be?  You have X number of years to live then its nothing. Your worm food.  Get it all while you can.  Fuck everyone else.  Nothing matters in the end, its all a big fucking cosmic accident, Lie, cheat, steal, murder.. who the fuck cares if you can get away with it.  What is love besides what you can get from someone else?  Honor a social contract (society) for the only reason that it keeps you safe, keeps the poor people from taking your shit.<br>

Here's a tangential question:  Prior to eating from the Tree of Knowledge man did not know right from wrong.  How, then, could Adam and Eve be justifiably punished for disobeying God, if they could not know that doing so was wrong?<br>

Did you know that atheists also love friends and family?  That they go through the exact same painful experiences as your friend, just without requiring &quot;faith&quot; to stay by the side of their loved ones?  I watched my grandmother waste away to nothing while I lived with her; her memory was to the point where she could hardly remember my name.  It didn't take any gods to do my best to make her life as pleasant as possible in her final years.  <br>
<br>
Your assessment of atheism is so shallow, so full of venom, that it seems to contradict all you've said thus far about Love.  There isn't any sort of love in your words, and I recommend taking a deep breath and asking yourself just what you're trying to say and why.<br>
<br>
Atheists, frankly, aren't much different from anyone else.  Really, I could respond to you saying much the same of Christians:  you can do anything, lie, cheat, steal, kill, whatever, because you &quot;know&quot; you'll be forgiven in the end.  What reason is there to pursue life, when Heaven is the ultimate goal?  Now, I know the answers that would be given, don't bother; I say this to show that L2's rant is just as offbase.<br>
<br>
Why live?  Because we are alive.  This is our only shot, so make the best of it.  Why not kill, steal, maim, and do all the things that people do regardless of belief system?  I can't speak for all, but for me it's not part of the Vision.  We're all in this boat together; it's up to everyone to do what they can -- be it in big ways or little ones -- to keep the world afloat and moving forward to...wherever we're going.  Also, because we see this as our one and only shot at life and know that everyone else is in the same boat, we have no desire to impede another's life journey through malice.  Your god, and oftentimes your people, do not oblige their fellow man this courtesy.<br>
<br>
It's worth noting that prison populations are dominated not by atheists but by theists, with followers of Protestant religions ranking highest, IIRC.  In fact, the proportion of religious inmates to atheist inmates is greater than the proportions of those populations outside of prison.  Maybe you can't see a reason for atheists not to run about raping and maiming or whatnot, but it's not hard for us.  You might instead wonder why so many Christians are in the lockup.<br>

Sure we're all worm food in the end, so what?  Death is not a part of life.<br>

And anyone who has briefly skimed the Old Testiment can attest to the fact that God has directly caused the harm of many people (ie Sodom and Gomorrah).  God is Good, but in the Old Testiment if you pissed him off he was as likely to toss down a bolt of lightning as call up a plague of locusts.  God is not your dotering grandfather who walks with a crutch and tends to forget where he's put his teeth!  <br>
<br>
I guess my point is this:  Christians should remember who it is they worship.  Non-believers should keep in mind that while we (christians) believe in a benevolent God, we also believe that God can and will punish us for our transgressions.  <br>
<br>
I expect a certain line of questions to result from this post... i'll try to answer them later.<br>
