I change my mind on this issue occasionally because both sides have good arguments.<br><br>Right now I am leaning on keeping them all illegal. I recognize that there is a good argument to legalize at least the softer drugs and simply taxing the bejeesus out of them. I also recognize that making them illegal does deter some people from their use (myself included). I really believe that addictive drugs are a burden on society ( I include alcohol and tobacco in this by the way). Some how, some way we need to wean people off the desire to slowly destroy themselves in the pursuit of a high. The question is how is this best accomplished.<br><br>Before I were to commit myself to a hard vote I would want to look at some research on places that have some level of legalization (i.e. Amsterdam). To date I have not done so and am relying on my gut feeling and life experiences.

Why you can still get 96 year sentences for possession (true case, in Oklahoma about 6 years ago) is beyond my comprehension.  Marijuana is currently classified as a Schedule FIVE drug (extremely dangerous, little potential for legitimate medical use), which means it is very difficult to even able to get permission to do legitimate *research* on this drug.  In contrast, morphine is only a Schedule 3 drug.<br><br>Despite the research that *has* been done indicating that marijuana has numerous potential theraputic benefits (for AIDS and cancer patients, among others), doctors still cannot prescribe it in the US, and must resort to vastly inferior substitutes or pure preparations such as Marinol, which make the patient much more 'drugged' than the marijuana would have, and have a variety of side effects.  I have had several HIV+ friends who could manage their pain just fine (and continue to hold down their jobs, etc) on a few hits of the green wonder (and their appetite improves as well), but taking Marinol or other drugs to manage their symptoms leaves them too messed up to function.

It is *not* any more of a 'gateway' drug than alcohol is, and is much less harsh on its users.  It doesn't (generally) make people violent or psychotic, and its potential for *physiological* addiction is very low.  I really don't see any difference between someone having a glass of wine when they get home from a hard day of work and smoking a bowl.  My ex-husband preferred the latter and it never became a problem. <br><br>In my 'experimenting' days, I tried everything from alcohol to LSD and was not infatuated with any of them.  I firmly believe that some folks simply have a propensity for substance abuse and some do not.  If we legalized, or at least decriminalized, some of the less dangerous drugs that are used for recreational purposes, we could save some of the *billions* that are thrown down the toilet in the worthless 'war on drugs', and spend a fraction of that on counseling and treatment for those who will need it, regardless of what chemical turns out to be their major problem...<br><br>Regards,<br>Nydia Ywalmoriel<br>Autonomous Collective    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/udruclin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Druclin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(3/26/02 8:46:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1140.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Drugs are bad, mmmkay?</span><hr size=1> I don't necessarily think that marijuana should be legalized, since that would lead to harder drug use as i have seen in a myriad of my friends over the years, but i do think that perhaps the penalties (talking about the US here) for possession, and distribution of marijuana should be lessened.

I really feel that alcohol has many more negative effects than marijuana does. But then that is a matter of opinion. I come to this opinion because I smoked pot from 18-24, then I quit and drank from 24-32. I have been sober now for three years and have no urge to do either of them again. But from my own experience alcohol was by far a more negative effect on my life in general. I experimented with most drugs out there during the time I was drinking, but rarely did I try anything when I was smoking pot. Alcohol really lowers a persons inhibitions allot, and I think it is actually more likely to be a gateway to harder drugs than even marijuana is. But, I believe saying alcohol or pot is the reason someone becomes a drug addict, is like blaming the gun instead of the person that pulled the trigger. As far as some drugs like LSD go, hell I think EVERYONE should take that ride at least once in their life, but that is a different story.<br>Someone said earlier that, some people wont use drugs because they are illegal. I really don't think that is the case in general. For those people that are concerned as to weather its legal or not, they are most likely the people that are also more aware of the negative effects on drugs anyway. The average person will do what he see's around him, and its already pretty clear that drugs are all around us. I think it would be better for them to be legal and Talked about, than to be illegal and the only argument ever used against doing drugs are that they are illegal first, and bad for you second.<br>There are some drugs that I feel should never under any circumstance be legal, these are Heroin, Crank (meth in any form really), Cocaine, and a few other very hard drugs. These drugs clearly do horrible things to people. There is no good in my opinion that can come out of these drugs in any form.

A number of factors will determine whether any given person will try harder drugs (peer pressure, availability, 'coolness' factor, etc).

And there is a reason why pushing it to be legal medically is not progressing much: It's too hard to regulate. As with any drug there are calculations to be made on how much should be in the blood stream, is most effective, and all else conceivable in order to figure out exact dosages. In a smoked form not all THC may be inhaled, and judging a completely accurate dosage is nearly impossible. With drugs such as Marinol the ammount of active ingredient can be measured accurately and dosed out appropriately. Now, is this the only solution to the cancer/AIDS problem of eating disorder? No, adjustments can be made in treatment as well. Why not fix the problem instead of introducing a half cure?<br><br>As for my experience with this subject, I've got a fairly good deal of it as my brother was a cancer patient and eventually victim (lung cancer from smoking). When I talked with him about marijuana and marinol and things like that, even though he at times was positively emaciated, he would decline every offer or proposal. He didn't think it was neccesary, or appealing to not be in his senses for however much life he judged that he had left. I probably wouldn't either.<br><br><br><br>Trulian Swiftblade <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ujableakl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jableakl</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local Resident</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(3/26/02 11:23:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1140.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Drugs are bad, mmmkay?</span><hr size=1> Cocaine Heroine Ecstasy acid and other synthetic drugs should remain illegal IMO.

Why are the first two legal and the latter is illegal? &quot;<br><br>I think the answer to this is simply that alcohol and tobacco have a much longer cultural presence in western society. I agree that they are no better for your health but they have been embedded in our culture for so long that they are granted exemptions from the &quot;war on drugs&quot;. Prohibition was an attempt to outlaw alcohol, but failed miserably due to the prevalence of drinking in our culture. Use of other drugs is no where near as significant in our cultural heritage. Over time that may change.<br><br> I think you are probably incorrect in your assessment that pot is harmless, at least in it's smoked form. Any foreign substance inhaled to your lungs will eventually cause damage. Pot also has effects on fertility (especially in males) as the THC tends to accumulate in the groin area over time. It is not as harmless as many would have you believe. <p>Gulor Gularin55 Paladin of Tunare- Vallis Scortor</p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=1140.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=1140.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=1140.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=1140.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=1140.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=1140.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=1140.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showPrevMessage?topicID=1140.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showNextMessage?topicID=1140.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1140.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=1140.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.threadControl?topicID=1140.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1140.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1140.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Diplomacy Corner<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Administration Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6>NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.7.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
