Shortly after Oiev disappears, Xalion appears to start auctioning a bloodpoint. When someone in my guild asks you how much, you say the currect offer is 35k and when you figure out we are the ones you just ditched, you stop replying to us.<br>
<br>
I dont give a rats ass about your mistwalker, what I care about is you are pulling very lame shit. I would think in the shadow of the event the others are giving you hell over, that you would straighten your act up. Appearantly not. I notice you avoided responding to me in the thread I started about your bullshit. You going to avoid it here to?<br>
<br>
You agreed to 30k, you made us bring it to you in Freeport, you better have the fuckin balls to stand behind your deal with the stipulations you made, if you want to have any credibility with people. If you had said sorry I got a better offer, we would have still been pissed off, but at least we wouldnt be sitting there waiting for someone that would never show. I am very close to believing all the crap people are posting about you due to the cowardly way you got out of a deal you agreed to.<br>

<br>
hey moron, get your goddamn story straight. i ended up with eldroth's mistwalker hours after he was hacked. i did not have his fungi tunic, BCG, NoS, or lammy. i traded the mistwalker a day or two later for an RBG, fungi tunic, heirophant's cloak, and blood point (to a very well respected person on the server). i traded the RBG to keyas for a BCG, donal's bracer, and ES bracer (GM confirmed trade), i traded the heirophant's cloak and blood point for a tobrin's mystical eyepatch (name escapes me 'cause it's been so long), and i traded the fungi tunic and a bone mask of the jarsath to keyas for an NoS (Another GM confirmed trade, the fact that she denies them is downright stupid).<br>
<br>
so krugan, don't go posting bullshit when you got all your facts screwed up, mmmkay? i didn't have his stuff &quot;minnites of the hack.&quot; it's people like you with your big ass lies who put me into my &quot;moods.&quot;<br>

They way you are defending yourself seems to confirm duplicity at the least in the crime.<br>
<br>
I have followed this since Eld was hacked.<br>
<br>
There were 4 Mistwalkers on Sol Ro you had one from an &quot;Unknown&quot; Can't remember his name toon.  This just shortly after one was hacked.<br>
<br>
/shrug<br>
<br>
I have one more question.  Where does a person aquire all the God/Dragon/Extremly High End gear that you have?  You are not of a level to get it.  Don't give me this BS that I traded for all of it.  <br>
<br>
I don't believe that someone has traded you these items with what your toon should have been able to get on his own.<br>
<br>
I have heard it all too.  I mad L33t Ph4t L3wtZ trades.  Sorry I don't by this load.  When people have the Items that you are trading now and in the Past they know what they have and its worth and they won't trade down with them.<br>
<br>
Hmm I remember another Sub Planar Trader from Sol Ro that seemed to have the same kind of stuff.<br>
<br>
I think my point is, that alot of things don't fit together.<br>
