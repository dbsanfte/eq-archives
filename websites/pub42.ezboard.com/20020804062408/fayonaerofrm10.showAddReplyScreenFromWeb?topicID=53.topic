<br>
These scrolls were passed to me, and thus it is I pass them on to you in hopes you make use of this knowledge. So much lust for treasure these days....Norrath is corrupt with greed and it sickens even my own tainted heart to see it so. Read this ancient lore....it will aid you in some way. I discovered an old book sealed with a symbol similar to that of the Sathir's own,long ago while exploring the libraries of Kaesora. Within this tomb is documented history the likes few have seen. Of note....was this....<br>
<br>
<br>
-2312 - 2813: Rise of the Shissar Kingdom. The Shissir were a race of intelligent snake men which colonized and ruled what is now the Overthere. Their dark capital was Chelsith, overlooking the cliffs on the sea. The Shissar nation grew slowly and to prominence as they explored dark rites and forgotten evils, and would lay the foundation for much of Iksar knowledge and philosophy. They enslaved the Iksar and used them as workers and food. The Shissir’s brutal disloyalty and blasphemous pride angered even their own gods. A great plague arose in the empire called the Green Death and washed over the kingdom in just a year. So fierce was the plague that no Shissar is known to have survived it. The Iksar were immune, and rose from the ashes to migrate outward across the continent, forming five principal tribe-states over the next several centuries. A new city was slowly erected over the first ruins of Chelsith, ruins that today still exist below the earth hiding forbidden evils and dark magic powerful from an age before time. <br>
<br>
-2113 : A shaman Iksar necromancer named Kotiz converses with the lesser god Zebuxoruk, and in exchange for 100 intelligent sacrifices, reveals to him battle knowledge which is inscribed in the unholy book of Zebuxoruk The book disappears upon Kotiz’s death. <br>
<br>
-1999 : A young and powerful warrior-mage of the Kunzar tribe rises to train the Kunzar to unbelievable levels of combat prowess. Coded in the ancient book of Zebuxoruk, and deciphered by Venril, advanced war techniques are implemented, and armies of dead are animated and bent to his will. His Kunzar armies march North and West with unyielding fury. <br>
<br>
-1999 - -1989 : The War of Joining. Sathir’s troops conquer and annex the remaining four Iksar tribe-states, Kylong, Nathsar, Obulus, and Jarsath. Sathir becomes the first king of the new Iksar empire Sebilis and heralds in an era of magnificent empire building. The old Kunzar city of Sebilis becomes the new imperial capitol and Innoruuk is the deity of the state. <br>
<br>
-1988 - -1985 : First Slaves’ War. Sathir’s troops crush and enslave the hill giants, forest giants and Froglok in a sweeping campaign of carnage. He orders the construction of naval shipyards at Viesar and Danak. Newly acquired giant and Froglok slaves are put to work, erecting powerful monuments and cites in the name of the Sebilsian Empire. <br>
<br>
-1984 : Trade begins with other continents. Sathir’s navy is immune to piracy because of its potency. He also uses the same to plunder the hapless vessels of other nations when he pleases. The cities of Charasis, Torsis, and Sebilis grow in might, power, and grandeur. <br>
<br>
-1950 : An aging Sathir seeks to cheat death, and makes an unholy pact with Innoruuk. The weak and sick of the Empire are routinely sacrificed to swell Innoruuk’s Cauldron of Souls. Sathir is given the knowledge of lichdom, and prepares an amulet into which he siphons his soul. It is to be placed in his corpse upon his own suicide, and after dark rites performed by loyal initiates, Sathir hopes to rise again as an immortal undead king. However, his first son Rile, heir apparent to the throne, learns of his father’s plans and interrupts the ritual, rendering it a failure. The priests rescue the amulet and speed it away. Rile destroys Sathir’s body and assumes the throne. The amulet is hidden in the crypts of Charasis, where a new dark cult forms dedicated to reviving Venril’s soul once again. The cult is named the Arisen. <br>
<br>
-1941 : Rile continues the same egomaniacal empire-building strategy that his father began. He leads a vast army against the mountain giants at Konikor, seizing the most productive mine on the continent in the Battle of Konikor. The mountain giants are enslaved and forced East to erect monuments of power for the Sebilisian Empire. <br>
<br>
-1936 : Rile orders the construction of a tower stronghold in the North Wood (now Warslik’s Wood). He assigns his trusted general Kurn Machta to oversee its construction and to be its lord. Kurn settles into his duty with fervor, slaughtering and torturing all who would oppose the Empire. This hated warlord swells the ranks of slaves in the East with fresh bodies monthly as he butchers and enslaves giant after giant. <br>
<br>
-1930 : The Council of the Hammer is formed by Karatukus (ancestor of Warslik), a great and wise forest giant. The Council brings the formally warring giant races together to form a united front against the Iksar with limited success. <br>
<br>
-1925 : Rile orders the construction of a southern stronghold similar to Korn’s Tower. The tower is named The Kurn, and is overseen by the vampire Iksar named Chosooth. Chosooth assails the giants from his nearly invincible fortress, and after they fall before his Iksar and undead hordes, he animates the giants to form an undead giant battalion of immense power. Rile is pleased. Most of the continent definitely belongs to Sibilis. Only the dragons and pockets of mountain and forest giant resistance remain unconquered. <br>
<br>
-1918 : The Ring of Scale meets in secret, and the dragon lords argue about the impending Iksar threat. Trakanon advocates powerful direct and immediate intervention on behalf of all the races against the Iksar. He is denounced by Jaled-dar, leader of the Ring. Trakanon does not give up, and slowly gains support among the younger dragonkind. The Ring of Scale rules to intervene against the Iksar only indirectly. <br>
<br>
-1915 : Rile sets out to attack kingdoms on Faydwer, taking great naval vessels to the north. His campaigns are successful and he is able to plunder at will. <br>
<br>
-1906 : A great squall arises at sea and shatters the Sbilisian navy. The king’s own warship, Fetid Plank, is lost with all hands. News of Rile’s demise brings great mourning in the Empire by the Iksar. His first son Atrebe assumes the imperial throne. The dragon Trakanon is rumored to have been behind this alleged ‘squall’ at sea, and it was indeed he and his dragon allies who sank the armada. The Ring of Scale is outraged and Jaled-dor orders the punishment of the dragons involved. <br>
<br>
-1907 - -1857 : The Insurrection of the Younger begins, a civil war of the dragonkind. The younger dragons face the elder in a contest of wills, magic, and might. Every so often a great clash can be seen from the sky, from which flaming shredded massive corpses rain down upon the mountains with the crash of thunder. It is a dark time for the children of Veeshan. <br>
<br>
-1889 : Atrebe delves heavily into the elder magic of the Shissar and of his grandfather. He is reclusive and mysterious, and all fear him. He uses his dark powers to conduct foul experiments in his mountain workshop of Kor-sha. <br>
<br>
-1882 : Atrebe successfully magically melds a captured dragon with an Iksar, creating a new and horrid race of intelligent dragon-men which he names the Sarnak. He breeds them quickly and secretly, bending and training them to his maniacal will. <br>
<br>
-1866 : Atrebe successfully magically melds a dragon with a Froglok, creating a new avian mount for his armies. Fiercely loyal and deadly in the attack, Atrebe breeds them in earnest. He names this new monstrosity the Sokokar. <br>
<br>
-1860 : Atrebe’s newly trained air force descends upon the remaining giant strongholds in a massive campaign of conquest lasting just a year. In the end, the Iksar are victorious, conquering mines and cities and enslaving the last of the mighty giants. Now only the dragonkind stand unconquered by the mighty Sibilisan Empire. <br>
<br>
-1857 : The Insurrection of the Younger ends with the older dragons winning the war. Trakanon and his followers are placed in stasis and banished to a magical prison in which they are doomed to oblivion for 600 years. The Ring of Scale then works to subvert the Iksarians indirectly through agents, magic, and division. <br>
<br>
-1856 : Atrebe perishes in one of his own foul rituals gone bad. His workshop and most of the mountain that contained it is destroyed in a blast of black-green fire. His third son and lead general, Ganak, acts quickly to assassinate his brothers and rises undisputed to the throne of Sebilis. <br>
<br>
-1856 onward : Climatic changes begin to reshape parts of the continent. Earthquakes occur more often than ever. Winds increase in the lands north of the Great Swamp, and the land becomes more and more barren and desert-like. Land rises on the south side of the Bay of the Moon, and the south entrance to the sea is narrowed. Viesar and Danak suffer great earthquake damage as well. <br>
<br>
-1850 - -1796 : A fifty-four year war erupts between the dragonkind and the Iksar, when Atrebe attacks the Ring of Scale with all the might of his airforce. His first victories are decisive, but he awakens a sleeping fury in the dragonkind, and many an Iksar town and city are laid waste by powerful dragon fire and elder magic. In the end, Ganak clashes in the sky above the Field of Bone with Jaled-dar, leader of the Ring of Scale. In a mighty clash, they are both incinerated by magic and fire and explode into flaming chunks which rain down upon the land. The war is inconclusive, but the Ring of Scale is smashed and broken, and the dragons retreat from their relentless hunters. The Iksar are quick to rebuild from the devastation using all the might of their slave labor. Ganak is hailed as a great hero, and his death is mourned for years to come. His only son and successor, Chottal, rises to take his father’s place on the imperial throne. <br>
<br>
-1795 : In a final blaze of revenge, a horde of dragons attacks the imperial palace by night, destroying it and the king. Only a handful of dragons escape with their lives, however, and they vow to return one day when the empire is weak. With no heir to the throne the Iksar nobles create the Emerald Circle, which will rule in the stead of a king. <br>
<br>
-1795 - -1525 : The Emerald Circle of nobles rules the Empire with total authority. Cities are enhanced and trade is expanded. The navy is rebuilt and prosperity returns to the empire. <br>
<br>
-1524 : Arguments over land and influence escalate to a fervorish pitch within the Emerald Circle. With no enemies left to vanquish, the Iksar nobles turn on each other, and the Empire is split asunder into five great states, each based upon the ancient tribal divisions of the Iksar themselves. <br>
<br>
-1523 - -1296 : Over two hundred years of civil war wrack the continent, as noble families and merchant houses wage war after war against their neighbors, each seeking to gain the upper hand and claim the title of emperor. The Ring of Scale has its agents meddle in every alliance and affair, always pitting the lords against one another. <br>
<br>
-1296 : Great earthquakes once again rock the continent. Viesar drops into the Lake of the Moon and is lost utterly. Danak is slit asunder and half of it slides into the sea. The naval forces and merchant vessels of the states are destroyed in one day as massive tidal waves wash over ports and vessels alike. Cities are rocked by the quakes and commerce is disrupted. Starvation and want begin to spread across the empire. The End Days begin. <br>
<br>
-1295 : The Iksar try desperately to rebuild, but starving Froglok and giant slaves begin to revolt. The Iksar are unorganized and desperately struggle to keep their minions in line. A Sledge merchant brings a wealthy haul of items to the Arisen. They discover one of the items is the pendant of Rile found in the north sea. The Arisen believe if they can find the bones of Rile, they may be able to resurrect Sathir using the amulet. Their plans never come to fruition, however. <br>
<br>
-1294 : All the slave races of the Iksar are in full revolt. Even the Sarnak turn against their masters. Cities burn and war is waged across the continent. <br>
<br>
-1294 - -1257 : Goblin lords in Faydwer hear of the calamities and begin shipping invading troops to Kunark to pillage the land. Kurn’s Tower is smashed and broken by an army of giants led by the massive mountain giant Warslik. The Karnor is smashed to ruins by forest and hill giant forces. The cities of the Iksar are assaulted and burned. The Iksar flee in terror to the forests and jungles where they are hunted down like dogs. <br>
<br>
-1256 : Trakanon and his dragon allies burst free from their 600 year imprisonment. Trakanon and his forces descend upon the weeping cities of the Iksar and reduce them to ash and ruins. Clouds of poison float through the streets of city after city, slaying any remaining Iksar. They breath fire upon the West Wood (now the Burning Wood) and set it ablaze, covering most of the continent with the haze of smoke which dims the sun for the better part of the year. Crops fail across the land and starvation kills more than the wars ever did. After a year of dragon devastation, it is clear that the Sibilisian Empire is no more. <br>
<br>
-1257 : The bones of the Iksar and other slain creatures are gathered and spread across the Field of Bone by Trakanon and his followers as a permanent warning to any who would seek to fill the shoes of the Iksar. The Ring of Scale reforms about Jaled-dar’s daughter Phara-dar. They demand an end to the destruction lest the continent itself be ripped apart. Trakanon refuses to rest until death and vows to stand watch over the Iksar that if ever they should rise again, he would be there to smash them down. He takes of residence in the council chambers of Sibilis and remains there still to this day. His young followers rejoin their brethren in the Ring of Scale lest they be banished again or slain outright. <br>
<br>
-1256 - -752 : Over the next 500 years, the other races begin to build new cities and cultures and intercontinental trade begins once again. The goblins dig in the northwest, multiplying and raiding the giants and remaining Iksar. They establish mines and armies, claiming the land for themselves. The giants return to bickering among themselves, with alliances constantly shifting so as to keep the balance of power between them. The Froglok return to their home in the Great Swamp, to their city of Krup. The Sokokar forget their training and domestication, and become the foremost hunters of the Iksar in the Emerald Jungle. The dragons retreat to secrecy and seclusion, to once again pull the invisible strings of fate from afar. The Sarnak hide in Trakanon’s Teeth, and begin to slowly and secretly build cities and mines, and to train for the day when they would take the place of the Iksar as masters of the continent. Smashed and broken, the remaining Iksar fall back into a tribal existence, scraping out a life of hardship and torment in the Emerald Jungle and the forests. <br>
<br>
-752 : A sledge explorer searches the ancient wreckage of the fleet which sank at sea under the leadership of Rile long ago. He discovers the corpse of Rile draped in jewelry and takes it whole as a trophy. <br>
<br>
-701 : The corpse of Rile is sold to a goblin king, Kaboktok, who places it in his throne room for all to see. He claims it was his goblin ancestor who slew Emperor Rile at sea. <br>
<br>
-622 : The mountain giant king, Farslik, descendant of Warslik, descends upon a rich goblin city. The mountain giants, with the aid of frost giants, capture the city-mine. Farslik takes the bones of Rile as a souvenir. <br>
<br>
-546 : For the first time, the Sarnak venture out into the ruins of the Iksar cities. Few return, but those who do possess priceless scrolls dealing in dark rituals and forbidden magic. The Sarnak begin to explore dark magic themselves, finding they have an uncanny knack for its use. <br>
<br>
-491 : The goblins mount an all out offensive on Konikor, sacking it for all its worth. Part of the bounty are the bones of Rile, which are sold to an Iksar merchant who then travels east. The mountain giants retake Konikor that same year. <br>
<br>
-483 : The merchant (whose name is Vlistis) sells the bones of Rile to the descendents of the Cult of the Arisen. They take the bones to Charasis and begin to search for the Amulet of Sathir in the wreckage, hoping that by bringing the soul of the father into the body of the son that they may perhaps bring back the first king of Sebilis. <br>
<br>
-433 : Fifty years of searching finally reveals the Amulet and dark rites are performed upon it and the bones of Rile. Nothing happens and the cult members believe they have failed utterly. They leave the bones of Rile on an altar beneath the ruins of Charasis. <br>
<br>
-389 : The Sarnak, hungry for more dark knowledge, journey into Charasis to loot its ancient tombs. A priest in the group find the scrolls the cult was using and in the presence of the bones of Rile unwittingly completes the ritual. Venril Sathir is sucked from his place of torment and after 1600 years is joined to the body of his backstabbing son. He rises from his bed-like altar and slays all the Sarnak. One of the Sarnak he transforms into a vampire, one that will loyally do his every bidding. <br>
<br>
-388 - -288 : For one hundred years, Venril Sathir travels among the ruined cities of the Iksar, collecting what remnants of power he can, and building about him an army of the dead. He travels west and seduces goblin and giants lords alike with promises of immortality and untold power. <br>
<br>
-222 : Venril establishes himself in the Dreadlands and begins to rebuild the shattered ruins of the Karnor. His minions raid caravans for weapons and supplies, and he begins to build expeditionary forces. He magically perverts some of the mortals to make a legion of lycanthropes, led by Thuuga, a wizard Iksar serpent changer. <br>
<br>
-175 : The giants meet in the council and decide to unite against an unknown enemy in Karnor, whose horrid legions are pillaging their cities and caravans. The goblins are asked to join to stomp out this new presence in the Dreadlands, and agree to do so for a price. They would receive Konikor, the richest mine in the world as their own. The giants agree and an assault is planned. The dragons are the ones to leak information to both sides that this threat in the Dreadlands must be stopped, fearing themselves that this unseen force may be an Iksar wizard of reborn power. The dragons also convince Thuuga that Sathir believes the lycanthropes are expendable and untrustworthy, and that he will eliminate them soon. Thuuga secretly joins the Alliance of the Stone against the undead. <br>
<br>
-172 : The Alliance of Stone (giants and goblins) descend unwittingly upon the Karnor. Venril is alerted to the attack before it occurs, however, by an agent of the Ring of Scale. The battle lasts for an entire year, and in the end, Sathir’s forces are crushed and driven back, most decisively by the betrayal of his lycanthrope troops. He takes refuge in the Bile, at an outpost he names Varis. <br>
<br>
-171 : Agents of the dragon council convince the goblins that the giants have no intention of giving up Konikor (which was untrue). They council the goblins to sneak attack and take it by force while it is weak. At the same time, agents of the council advise the giants that the goblins intent to take Konikor in battle and other mines as well. The dragons’ plans work, and war ensues. <br>
<br>
-171 - -142 : A thirty year war is fought between the giants and the goblins, called the War of Lies (in that each side believes the other to be liars). It ends in a stalemate, with very heavy casualties on all sides. The giants retain control of Konikor. <br>
<br>
-132 : The Sarnak establish outposts in the Frontier Mountains and being to capture Sokokar young and train them as battle attack dogs. <br>
<br>
-130 : One of the members of the Ring of Scale disappears over Trakanon’s Teeth. Trakanon is implicated, however no evidence can be found. In fact, it was the Sarnak testing their prowess in combat against their dragon ancestors. <br>
<br>
-101 : The Sarnak invade and conquer two small goblin mines in the Frontier Mountains. The giants take once again to squabbling amongst themselves. The Sarnak begin to breed Goblin and Froglok slaves. <br>
<br>
-50 : The first landing by elves is made at what is now Firiona Vie. The elves are slain within the year by Froglok raids. Venril Sathir relocates back to the Karnor and begins to rebuild once more, only more quietly. He rousts the lycanthropes from Karnor into the wilds of the Dreadlands. He begins to animate an army of the dead once again. <br>
<br>
-25 : Again, elves land in Firiona Vie. This time they are able to resist the Frogloks. However, the swamp and hill giants see them as a threat and descend upon Firiona Vie in force. All the elves are slain save for a few who escape back to the sea. Sathir re-establishes his outpost at Varis as a lookout to the East. He sends his best lieutenant to the lost city of Kaesora in the Field of Bone. <br>
<br>
-2 : The elves land once again in Firiona Vie in force. A fort is erected and the giants are too busy squabbling amongst themselves to notice. The Froglok raid continually, but are unable to breach the elves’ defenses. <br>
<br>
-1 : Adventurers, mercenaries and frontiersmen arrive at Firiona Vie. They are elven, human, and dwarven. The growing town is fortified further and begins trade with a more peaceful hill giant tribe in the Dreadlands. They lyncathropes form an uneasy alliance with the hill giants of the region to suppress the rapidly growing power of Venril Sathir at Karnor. Sathir sends an agent that appears to the Sarnak as one of their own and within one year is elected to the king’s council. There he begins to subvert the Sarnak to his own designs, convincing them to eliminate the Ring of Scale altogether.
