&quot;Doesn't it ever stop raining?&quot; grumbled Vanlaan as we cautiously made our way through the Plains of Karana.  I looked at him a moment, trying to decide if he was joking or not, but couldn't be quite sure with his face hidden, trying to keep the rain off.  We had been making this trek for a few days now, but the most difficult part of the journey had barely begun.<br>
<br>
As we reached the Qeynos Hills, I spotted a guard patrolling nearby.  It didn't appear that he saw me, but it seemed unwise to take chances.  We were in danger enough.  For some reason, the Church of the Firstborn had decided to pull us out of active duty in Kunark, and send us to work with the worshippers of Cazic-Thule in - of all places - Paineel.<br>
<br>
I consider myself fairly well travelled - before I chose to follow Innoruuk's Path, I spent a few years researching all I could about the different gods of Norrath.  Even the libraries of Qeynos were open to me, but never those of Erud.  Only in recent years had the Erudites been willing to be more open with their holy texts - but, to them, almost all writing was holy.  By definition, the same had to hold true of the worshippers of the Faceless One, but more importantly, the Church had special plans for us.<br>
<br>
We simply didn't know what they were.<br>
<br>
A selection of maps on loan from the Dismal Rage, my old church, helped us make a quick descent into the sewers under Qeynos.  To be safe, we checked in with the rulers of these catacombs, the human worshippers of Cazic Thule.  They distrusted us for our beliefs, but otherwise grudgingly accepted our presence.<br>
<br>
Our only problem occured when we reached the docks - a would-be guard decided that he didn't fancy us and tried to call to the guards.  Between Vanlaan's magic and my blade, he quickly ended up on the bottom of the bay.  Those that saw us weren't stupid enough to try to repeat his mistakes.  Finally, the boat arrived, and we embarked on the long trip to Erudin.<br>
<br>
It became annoyingly clear during the boat ride that we were not completely ready, as we discovered our food supplies running seriously low.  &quot;Either we can pick up supplies in Paineel,&quot; said Vanlaan, &quot;or we turn around and admit failure.&quot;  That wasn't acceptable to either of us, and it was too late anyway.<br>
<br>
Finally, we reached the docks of Erud.  As planned, I jumped off the boat to try and seek safe passage through the city.  However, Vanlaan made a terrible mistake.  Awed by the sights of the city, he stepped onto a waiting shuttle to get a closer look.<br>
<br>
I reached a rocky outcropping near the city just in time to see him crumple at the hands of the Erudin guards.  I couldn't tell if he was merely wounded and ignored, or dead.  And I couldn't do anything to reach him.<br>
<br>
But he was my lifemate, and our existences were firmly entwined by Innoruuk's hand.  If Vanlaan was dead... I had to join him.  This was Innoruuk's will. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=30.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=30.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=30.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=30.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.threadControl?topicID=30.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=30.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=30.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm14">Guilds<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm13">NWN & Morrowind<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Trash Bin<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Staff Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10>Roleplaying & GM Events</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
