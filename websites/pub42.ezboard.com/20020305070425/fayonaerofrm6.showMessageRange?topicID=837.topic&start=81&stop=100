No one was allowed to pick or choose. We are born and..well... here we all are. We all know that we are going to die, and that limitation of morality is what shapes the Human condition and all the baggage that accompanies it. People invariably seek a frame of mind in order to put that Human condition into perspective. Some will seek shelter in Scripture, some in Science, some in Material Objects, some in Addiction and others in Relationships. Most will live in an existance that is a little of all to various degrees.<br>
     People have and always will debate that they have THE ANSWER or the KEY TO A HAPPY LIFE, when in reality, its all bullshit. No one person can say that they have the answer for everyone if a certain lifestyle makes them happy, since we are all unique. People have to find answers for themselves. People tend to be happier when left to their own devices and pursuits, even when others don't agree. Even if a behavior is considered to be deviant by one school of thought, it maybe perfectly acceptable in another. The only thing Humans can agree on is that we will disagree with each other. Knowing that ultimately, someone is going to disagree with any particular thing you might do reguardless of what it is, you might as well just do what you want and say to hell with everyone else since you are the one living your life. If you want to be obnoxious about it, hey, its your life. As long as you respect what other people believe is the best way to go about things in order to live a full happy life, and concentrate on your own happiness, things are much easier.<br>
<br>
My point? If I have one its this: Stop debating life and just live it. Clock is ticking, folks.<br>

I could go into describing the despair and sorrow I feel when I see others sinning, but that's another thread for another day.<br>

One quick thing though, if you saw a young man trying in vain to impregnate a dog, what would you think?  Would you be as open minded about that?  Or is he deviant?  After all, he just really loves his dog.<br>

Unless that floats your boat as visual entertainment, its probably best to not linger around there long. If people fucking dogs disturbs you, then don't watch or you can try and intervene on what you believe to be that person's behalf. Just be careful if dog fucking turns out to be a part of that person's religion and you are ruining that person's chances of a happy Afterlife. If its your dog getting fucked by a stranger, then that might be within reason to do something. If you are fucking your own dog...hey, its your dog. Just keep in mind that its a good bet the dog didn't have a say in it and you are doing the dog wrong. Do what you want, and if you catch shit for it because its considered deviant behavior, than that is a ramification of a life decision. You can either defend your actions or seek to correct them somehow.<br>

So what you are asking him to do now is to go AGAINST the decision he has already made.<br>
<br>
Someone asked me to think about what the &quot;choice&quot; of being homosexual does to your life.  I want you to know, whoever that was back on page 3 of this thread, that I have thought about it and this is what I've decided I believe:<br>
<br>
Homosexuality is a choice.  You asked if people would really make the choice to be gay considering all the problems that would cause them to have in their life.  I say yes.  People for thousands of years have made choices that have made them the target of persecution.  The easiest example of this is Christians in Roman times.  They chose to be Christian, knowing what the consequences would be, they chose not to hide the fact that they were christian, still knowing what the choices would be, and they lived (or died) by that decision.<br>
<br>
The fact that there are consequences to our choices does not negate the fact that they are still choices we make.  I did not chose to be raised Christian, but I was.  And when the time came for me to make the choice to either continue down that path, or to walk another, I chose.<br>
<br>
In the same vein, people are raised how they are raised (though i accept the fact that very few people are actually raised gay) and when the time comes for them to choose how to live their sexual life, they choose.<br>
<br>
The fact that most of us chose our sexuality during a very emotional time of our lives probably does not help things.  Adolescence (sp) is probably the WORST time for people to make choices that are going to affect them for the rest of their life, but that is the time when we start feeling our sexuality and, therefore, the time we usually choose which sex we find attractive.  I think this is illustrated in the fact that some people find themselves attracted to BOTH sexes during adolescence (sp again) and only through experimentation are they able to choose which sex they want.  I think this is further illustrated by the fact that some people never choose between either but, rather, continue to be attracted to both.<br>
<br>
I take into account that our upbringing is a huge factor in our sexuality, as it is a factor in everything.  But I think until some geninisist (sp again... dictionary.com wont load NOOOOOOO) finds the &quot;sexuality&quot; gene and shows us that sexuality is, in fact, geneticly predisposed I will continue to believe that our sexuality is as much a choice as our religious belief.<br>

  it was easy to GUESS me a white /straight /american,, because in my post i said i was a white male, from West Virginia.. and by me referring to gays as them and straight as us,, YOU GUESSED NOTHING.  I told you exactly what i was.<br>
<br>
  Sports was just an example of taking pride in what i am,, not a comparison of which is more important. I never once said i thought opression of a gays way of life is anything like a being a sports fan,  just an easy way for me to show how i would be proud of what i am regardless of someones thoughts.<br>
<br>
  I also mentioned that because im white/ male from West Virginia that im a little bull-headed about gays getting upset about being called gay.. I was admitting that i probably just dont get it no matter how hard i try, because ive never been in that situation.  Did you read my whole post???   i also mentioned that i attempt to see others point of view, but sometimes i cant see it no matter how hard i try. <br>
<br>
 I admit that my race, skin color, where i live , and how i was raised,  has definitely kept me from truly understanding what a repressed individual goes through on a daily basis.  So my statement of &quot;&quot;<br>
    'If i were in the 1% and the 99% were calling me names because of what i am, i would take no offense to it if i were truely proud of what i was'<br>
<br>
  is true from my standpoint. Though again i admit that i could feel this way only because im not a minority or opressed.   <br>
<br>
  I know my sports example was very poor.  But it was not saying that opression and cheering for a team is similar.. the only thing i meant out of all of it was that , no matter what,, im proud of everything i am,, and i dont see why gays getting called gay by a straight person is so offensive.. and before you attack again,, ill repeat,, i know part of me feeling this way could be because i have never been on the other side of the table..<br>

I'd just like to take a minute to explain to those who may not have ever dealt with a non-televangelisque/non-Jesus-nut religious person.  It is quite long afterall, and long posts tend to drag on.<br>
<br>
Leviticus 20, verse 13:  "If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable.  They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads."<br>
<br>
However, if you ask any Christian, they'll tell you that Christ's death and resurection absolved the people of following the laws of the old testamnet, including the ten commandments and all of the laws of Leviticus.  New laws were then  set in place by Christ throughout the new testament.<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 6, verse 9: "Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God?  Do not be deceived:  Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders ... will inherit the kingdom of God."<br>
<br>
A -true- Christian knows it is not his place to sentance peole, to claim what anothers rights and privelages are.  As a tax-paying citizen, you have, in the United States, the right to do whatever you damn well please.  If I have to, I'll die to defend that right.  If Tim wants to ram his midsection into the netherregions of Tom, go for it.  If Jenny wants to grab a strap-on and have an all-night lube session with Sarah, you go girl.<br>
<br>
However, it is my sworn duty as a confirmed Child of Christ to do whatever is in my power to sway Homosexuals, rapists, murderers, thieves, and any unbeliever to the "light of Christ."  Do I do this 24/7?  Do I door to door evangelize?  Hell no, I've got other things to do with my time, like play EQ.  But if the opportunity presents itself, like right now...<br>
<br>
I've lived with the knowledge of Christ for most of my life.  For a good 19 years of my life, "Christianity" was just something I had to get up early on a sunday morning for and dress up nice.  It wasn't until about two years that I actually sat and thought about it.<br>
<br>
Some people try to "convert" gay people because they find it distasteful.  Some do it because it's "deviant."  Some people just do it because it gives them someone to look down on.  Makes them feel important.<br>
<br>
I do it because I feel the presence of Christ in my every day life.  The comforting knowledge that -no- matter how shitty life ever gets, no matter what horrible stuff happens to me or my closest family and friends, in the end, it'll all be washed away, and eternal bliss and happiness is there for my family and friends to share for the live everlasting.<br>
<br>
I myself am far from perfect.  I've stolen, I've lied, I've harmed others, I've lusted, I've slandered, the list goes on.  But so long as I recognize my wickedness and in my heart repent, I believe that salvation and that the life everlasting is mine through the words and deeds of Christ, I'm forgiven.<br>
<br>
-That- is why -many- Christians out there strive to convince others that homosexuality is a choice.  It's easier to deny your sexual urges if you think of them as a choice rather then a lifestyle.<br>
<br>
I'll probably never be able to quite lying to others, or saying hurtful things.  But I know they're wrong and I shouldn't do them.  If someone is equally addicted to homosexual intercourse, then there's not much one can do.  However, if I can make that person see that it is indeed a sin, and one that they need to repent of, I've done my job.<br>
<br>
People think that knowing about your sins brings about a great depression in people.  I'm telling you that it isn't that way.  In fact, the warmth I feel in knowing Christ overrides any evil I may ever do.<br>
<br>
If you want, you can hold a gun to my head and tell me to stop trying to help "sinners" find redemption.  I'll just smile and quote perhaps my most beloved passage, the first I ever learned.<br>
<br>
John 3, verse 16:  "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have eternal life." <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=35824><img src=http://www.theperfectflaw.com/picture/brain.gif></a><br>

I dont know if you are born with a propensity to become gay, or if its environmental. WHat I do believe is your sexuality is determined way before you are even aware of what sexuality even is. At least that is how it was for me. If I remember way way way back when, the very first person I ever had a crush on was this little brown haired girl named Nicole in kindergarden. I remember thinking oh my she is just the perfect girl ever. She had long dark straight hair, and bangs, she also had very light colored skin. To this day that particular look on a woman (yes woman not girl) still gets me going. If I look back on my maturity level at the time I think I can honestly say that I had no freaking clue what so ever about who I was sexually as a person. I just naturally was attracted to girls, that is all I know for sure. By the time I was a teen I had already had many, many such crushes and for some reason they where always with girls. BUT, what if that first day of kindergarden I saw a little blonde boy, and I developed a crush on him? I surely wouldnt have doubted myself at the time, considering I had no clue what Gay was, or what sexuality even was at all. I imagine I would have developed several crushes on boys at the time, just like I did on different girls. What im trying to say I guess here is, I just naturally was attracted to women from very early on in my life. I had no clue or care what so ever as to weather or not I was making a CHOICE, at all, my choice was simply made by my hormons and desires at that time. I have a good enough imagination to believe that had I been attracted to boys at that time, I would now be gay. I dont believe its a choice at all, I believe its what sexually drives you, and it happens from a very early time in your life. Now if you never had a sexual impulse what so ever untill age 15, and at that time you then were given a choice where to unleash your hormons to, then I might believe its a choice.<br>

I should probably look back over this and see how horrid my grammar and spelling are, but its just too late at night.. so bare with it. ;-) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uhalochanter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HaloChanter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Post-o-holic</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/25/02 12:45:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=837.topic&index=98>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Deviant, evolution, get over it?</span><hr size=1> 'I know my sports example was very poor.

<br>
- First off, I'm not attacking you mate, no matter how other's see it. It's a messageboard, when I quote and counter argument, it really doesn't mean I have anything against you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
And secondly, you have to understand that your example was so out of place, and uncomparable, that it's prety much like me saying 'This chocolate bar is like a ham sandwhich' (phear the ham). The fact that you discredited it yourself, saying that it doesn't match the opression of homosexual people, and then repeat it saying how if you are proud of supporting a sports team, then homosexual people should be proud.. it's prety puzzling :P<br>
Your main point is that you don't understand why gay people don't like being called gay. Well bud, that's not it at all. If someone walked up to a person, and said 'hey, hey yeah you're gay!' they'd probably go 'Uhh yeah, so?'. I think what they don't like, is the general dispisement that people give them. The way they're beaten up, killed, spat at, abused, frowned on, and generally isolated by the average Joe.<br>
<br>
Criso mate, could ya throw some quotes in with your drive-by remark? Kind of having trouble following your, hmm.. 'point', if it can be called that.<br>

Maybe that helps you understand, maybe not. Perhaps you are only capable of understanding what bigotry and racism are when it is applied to a minority. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=837.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=837.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=837.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=837.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a> <b>5</b> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=837.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=837.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=837.topic&start=141&stop=158>8</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showPrevMessage?topicID=837.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showNextMessage?topicID=837.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=837.topic&index=100><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=837.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.threadControl?topicID=837.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=837.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=837.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Diplomacy Corner<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Administration Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6>NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
