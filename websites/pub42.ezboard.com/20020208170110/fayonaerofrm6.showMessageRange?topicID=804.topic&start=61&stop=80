Ullric, it's nice that you try to stick up for your guild, even if it is ToV, but flat out lying doesn't do anything.  You weren't there, you didn't have a larger force, we didn't train you, and ToV didn't pull Magi first...end of story.  If you want to go further, your guild kept asking us to help mez all yours adds because you had one enchanter and some crappy pullers.  We decided you guys were going to get us killed so we had our two monks FD pull Magi to us, engaged him, you guys attempted to KS (poorly...think you would be better at that by now), we killed him and Magior looted, then your guild starting shouting profanities in public channels.  Cool, can I be in your guild?<br>
<br>
For those of you that want to bash Final Destiny, guess you haven't seen the many times we have saved guilds from Fear, Hate, or numerous other places.  I guess you haven't seen the number of times our clerics have gone out of their way to rez people even when we were busy.  I guess you haven't seen our rogues and monks drag corpses to save other guilds coffin expenses.  I guess you haven't seen our Vox/Naggy raids where we let others in on loot who aren't Final Destiny members.  <br>
<br>
You guys are right, both guilds have reputations.  I'm just glad I'm wearing the guildtag that has a positive reflection to people.  <br>

Just to give you a clue...<br>
<br>
When uber raids for TOV were places like Hate and Fear.. the Guild felt I had earned the right to loot the icondolite BP I am wearing. Which leads me to my second point....<br>
<br>
I do not have a COF, Warlords Greaves, Warlord BP or Warlord arms. Because? I have not been to many events recently... Although I attend everything I am capable of attending. The reason....<br>
<br>
Because I am currently in Europe for work. I have been in Europe for the last two months. Prior to being in Europe I was on a project for a year where I was away from home half of the month.<br>
<br>
Now Blizz instead of posting crap... just tell us straight up... when did you join TOV and then let us judge who the hell did what.<br>

I cant remember when I joined the guild. All I know is that I went to every damn raid Tides had ever since I joined, exceptions being the last couple days I was in the guild. Im sorry you have such hatred towards me because I looted Your warlords bp and legs (technically i didnt loot the legs, someone else did while I was in ragefire camp and I tried to reject the BP loot, keep in mind). It isnt my fault you werent there.<br>
<br>
Why is it that You are the one adressing this post? I was expecting such things from a member that was actually there when I got my items, or even when I left the guild...<br>
<br>
Tides of Valor, I apologize for my harsh Words in my previous posts. I was just upset at the time (member from ToV claiming he wants to dupe my cof in an attempt to get it from me and what not) and maybe I shouldnt have started this post in the first place.I never liked it when people hated me in the game... Even if it is a game, i liked being liked. When dyscord was ignoring me because she thought I trained her group LONG ago, I was sad. And now, im sure everyone in Tides hates me. It makes me sad that you folks would do this to the one that lubsjoo the most... Blizz will always lubsjoo, even if you hate me... /hug<br>

PS, smallmee Please read my post ENTIRELY before you post a response... you will understand more of how and why I posted what I did. I know its Long and all but still, Its always best if you know what youre talking about if youre going to respond. And if you knew me at all you would know i care less for loot. I was past lvl 46 for ages now and i still only have indocolite boots and gloves. I give up loot all the time to others. You dont have to believe.

In short, most of the people in our guild who have a &quot;guild&quot; item probably already know what they SHOULD give back if they left; and I hope we've chosen people with the character and backbone TO give them back. (Because in all honesty, we can't make them...) like, qoute off<br>

- Well, that's just sad. Very. But I guess discussing how pathetic that is would lead to a hyjacking. So I'll stick to the topic.<br>
You know, as hard as I try to not let myself be subject to harsh generalizations, sometimes I just can't help it. <br>
I haven't liked ToV for well over 8 months, back in Hate when they pulled over our Rezzing CR attempt. And pulled, and pulled. And when asked to stop - because we kept dying - were abused in public channels. And then we fast foward 8 months, and I hear you're still doing this shit in Hate? You just can't help but wonder, ya know?<br>
And sure, you guys have some nice people. Had the pleasure to group with some of them of late in Sebilis. But EVERY single Tides of Valor member I've ever come across, obtains this aura about them that screams '11yr old loot greedy whining backstabbing d00d talking prick'. That sort of aura.<br>

I have been in the best, and the worst guilds on Karana-&gt; ayone ro.  Half the damn problem is the way some guilds loot.  Here is an example I saw, Vision XA and possible a few other, recently killed VS.  Tolans legs and Elderspiritist legs dropped.  So all the rangers rolled on the Tolans legs.  The winner was then told by his guild that he may Not keep them and they are guild property and may go to some ranger that wasn't on and doesn't play alot(from my view).  This is bullshit, the ranger kept the legs, since no one else needed.  But it's retared that someone who goes to the raid and can REALLY use the the gear doesnt get it.  It's rediculous, if you are of the using class that can use the gear, you should get a shot at it, only if no one needs it should someone who wasn't there get it.  And once you get something, its yours screw all this guild property shit.  If you lessend the gay rules on loots, guild become better, no petty squabbling like this, and everyone earns their gear.  In Blizz's case, hes a damn good Warrior, and has always been well equiped to my knowledge.  If he was only in the guild for a month or a year, if he put in the time at the damn raids its his.  This is appaling the way eq player's squabble over gay loot.  There were only 2 guilds I can EVER remember that got this notion, Eternal Wrath and COmbine(ole school ub3r for Karana) Although combine ultamitly broke up due to l00t but, the GM was stealing <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) just my 2 cents<br>

Wow that's an easy excuse to use, who were you playing then?<br>
<br>
And Ullric, if we are misrepresenting that facts, how come I see only you from Tides posting the lies that you believe in?  Where are your guildies to back you up?  Hell, even Abindigo posted on this thread and didn't say a word to back you up.  You know why?  You are wrong and a liar.  <br>
<br>
Face it son, your guild has a bad reputation for a reason.  Other guilds didn't band together to make up lies about Tides.  We don't have to, as stupid as it sounds, your guild does all of this retarded stuff unprovoked.<br>

We give class specific items to class leaders to figure out what to do with.  If Vision got an item like that, the class has already agreed IN ADVANCE* as to how to handle items that affect them alone.<br>
<br>
So, could you explain how it's total bullshit that people agreed in advance on how to handle their own classes loot and then stuck to that agreement?<br>
<br>
If XA got the item, our rangers rolled against their rangers to decide what GUILD got them; probably.<br>
<br>
While Vision certainly believes in individual character development, we also believe in working for the team.  Something which it seems you do not.<br>

That isn't the reason for my comments. The reason is this:<br>
<br>
YOU start a thread that is basically flaming the guild. I see a bunch of other people flaming the guild in response to your flame. I get pissed off because I know, as a long time member of ToV, that what has become the sum total reputation of our guild has been the result of disgruntled people like yourself leaving the guild and sharing their dirty laundry with everyone in the world who DO NOT HAVE ANY WAY OF KNOWING THE COMPLETE STORY and our problem with prepubescent ToV members who haven't figured out how to make their legs stop twitching while they sit at their computers playing EQ (and I am convinced that somehow, getting that twitch to stop would make those bastards act with some dignity and respect).<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, every guild will have their share of immature members and I guess they have braced up their policies to not accept any of this sort of shitty behavior (that may be exactly what we need to do, I don't know). I, for one, group with many ToV members who are great people and in no way &quot;bad&quot; EQ'ers. We have good people in our guild and those of you who would just take a look at these folks, would realize that the scum of ToV always manage to float to the top of the barrel and invariably get scraped off. The core of ToV is good, we are just going through growings pains and haven't quite accepted that we may need to get a larger barrel.<br>
