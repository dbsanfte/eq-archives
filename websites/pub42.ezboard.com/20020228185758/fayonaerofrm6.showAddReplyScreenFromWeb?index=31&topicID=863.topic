<br>
&quot;The situation at Kalorek`Dar is much more like Lozidal than Trakanon.&quot;<br>
<br>
Why did you type?:<br>
<br>
&quot;We perceived this much like a Trakanon or Lozidal raid.&quot;<br>
<br>
I can only respond to what you type.  It takes psychic abilities to determine what you really meant if you typed something different.  You said you perceived this much like a Trakanon or Lozidal raid, when the Trakanon part was flat out untrue.<br>
<br>
&quot;Numbers don't equate to readiness. Having more people in a zone doesn't make you any more or any less ready to engage a target. You say yourself that we had people in the zone while you were gathering. Well, we were gathing too. We just gathered the NECESSARY and READY force faster.&quot;<br>
<br>
But when you say that you perceive this like a Trakanon raid, 17 of us present 3 of you, you imply that you would not leapfrog an already established force in the area... which was an untrue statement, and what I'm calling  you on.  If your Trakanon comment hadn't been in there, that section of your post would not have needed commenting on.<br>
<br>
And like I said, I don't care about the spawn.  We let our guard down because we thought there'd be a mutual respect, we were wrong and you burned us.  There's really nothing more to say about who beat who to the spawn, because that's not the issue I'm interested in.  You beat us there because we made the mistake of thinking you'd respect our presence and took our time (there were THREEEE of you present at this time).  <br>
<br>
This is my real beef, and you just did it AGAIN:<br>
<br>
&quot;Second, as to you who has to ask who... ...sadly it boils down to this: If our two guild run into a similar situation, and there is no communication, then it is likely, based on previous events that Vision will end up winning the race. If our two guilds run into a similar situation, and there IS communication, unless you plan on holding a grudge, our guilds will probably end up working together.&quot;<br>
<br>
You talk of &quot;if there's communication&quot;... but YOU were not willing to communicate with US.  Don't talk about being willing to work together if we only communicate, when you went out of your way to NOT communicate.  WE were not obligated to send a tell to YOU... YOU were obligated to send a tell to US.  You, with the way you are talking, are saying that you'll enter a zone, and if the forces there (that you can plainly see there already) don't send Vision a tell, then Vision will race them to the target.  And I ask you, &quot;Who the hell do you think you are?&quot; that we have to communicate with YOU when you should have been the ones openning communication first.  It's a superior attitude.  The &quot;We don't send tells to those types of people, they send tells to us&quot; attitude.  Sorry, no.  When you enter a zone, YOU do a &quot;camp check&quot;, the ZONE doesn't automatically detect your presence and start sending you tells from every camp across the place.<br>
<br>
Communication was not open because YOU did not open it (we were 17, you were just entering and had 3).<br>
<br>
If your intention was no communication, and to race from the start, there would have been no discusion here and I would not have popped up and said anything.  BUT, you in your post say that if communication had taken place, things could have been worked out.  Funny, saying &quot;well if you would have only communicated&quot;, when you had no intentions of communicating.  THAT'S what you did that has me posting... NOT that you beat us to the spawn.<br>
<br>
Let's say VS is up.  A guild is in force and buffing near his room getting ready to rush in.  Then another guild rushes into the room, not saying a word to the one sitting there, takes VS, then turns to the other guild and says &quot;If you would have only communicated with us, we could have worked something out&quot;.  That's what you did to us.  YOU don't have the right to say you took the spawn because we didn't communicate with YOU...  because YOU should have communicated with US.<br>
<br>
It's not the spawn.  It's the fact that you feel that we must &quot;answer to you&quot; before thinking about taking a spawn somewhere.  That whole section about -we should have communicated with you- is a degrading, pushy, and rude.  You did NOT respect us as an equal (which EVERYONE is), and looked down upon us, as we were lower than you and should have asked nicely for the spawn or something.  It's bullshit, pure bullshit.<br>
<br>
I thank you Sandin54 for those words.  You at least seem to understand... Palimax however only repeated that we needed to communicate with him, disrespecting and degrading us a second time.<br>
<br>
We do not answer to Vision, you do not answer to us.  When you enter a zone, the inhabitants are not obligated to TELL you what they plan on hitting... the person ENTERING the zone is obligated.  The opposite implies a superior, we own this place, answer to us or we take it, attitude. <p>--Lord Hagus Bruichladdich, 60 Warlord of Divine Legion.<BR>
