<br>
Even if this is not really THE weapon for a lvl51 player, I am very proud of it since it is a GM Event only Weapon and prolly unique on this server. <br>
<br>
It has a special name which I forgot right now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
ALso a pity it doesn't even look special when hold in hand.<br>
Sir Arquinval got a really really really nice looking weapon with a look I haven't seen so far. <br>
but his sword is around 7dmg 30del if I am right, so no uber weapon either.<br>
<br>
