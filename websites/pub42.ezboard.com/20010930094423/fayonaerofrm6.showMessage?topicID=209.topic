I wish I could still use my commodore 64 to play EQ...sadly it became outdated..<br>
<br>
Blighted, Apothic, Carmine, are still good robes, but there are better now... thats life.<br>
<br>
Not sure what Skyshrine Robe your talking about...but if you mean the Skyshrine Quest stuff is easy to get, your on crack.. the Halls of Testing in ToV is no freaking picnic.<br>
<br>
Anyway... your gear will reflect what your doing ..  If your a capable and effecient necro with what your doing in your gear, then whats the problem?  A better robe out there has no bearing on your skill or lack there of.<br>

I think what people are trying to point out is that just because you saw it on a spoiler site doesn't at all mean that it's easier to get than the existing planar stuff.  Stuff from PoH/PoF is honestly not that hard to aquire.  A single group can pull up there and get armor if you know what you're doing. <p><i>Zuht<br>Templar of <a href="http://www.eqlooking-glass.com">The Looking Glass</a></a><br>

i saw a wizzie friend of mine happily giving away his FBCR after a carmine robe dropped in fear and he won it. he was nearly collapsing because he was so happy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . that was less than 2 months ago.<br>
<br>
so, of course there's a lot of new stuff and many items you are able to get with velious are much better than plane or kunark stuff, but that doesn't make older plane gear useless. i would still die for a vermiculated bracelet. yes, the thurgadin quest armor bracer are nice too, but they don't beat the plane bracelet at all, imo. this is just one example.<br>
<br>
verant already revamped hate and fear, ct and inno drop new stuff along with some of the regular mob types, and they are harder than before. some of the new stuff is even better than velious stuff (the robe zuht mentioned belongs to it).<br>
<br>
as for the robe of benevolence quest...the third part/trade-in is known, and it's one of the best priest range slot/offhand items i'm aware of. i think the quest is not really that hard, if you are highlvl enough and have a strong party or two with you. the reward is much greater than the risk you put in by doing the quest. you are right that verant needs to tune this a bit (talking about a quest here, you could also say some items need to be reviewed). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ulleauaric.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lleauaric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(5/2/01 1:13:41 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.eternalwrath.net/members/lleauaric.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I Don't get it......</span><hr size=1> Ahhh  I see it now<br>

re reading the posts..  I see the problem<br>
<br>
Your a &quot;AC caster&quot;  Damius<br>
<br>
By that I mean a caster who works to increase his AC over other Stats<br>
Nothing wrong with that, thats just a philosophy<br>
Me, personally, Im a Mana/resist/Agi type of guy<br>
<br>
Im still wearing a Carmine Robe, but thats cool, Its still a great robe, and the look is distinctive.<br>
<br>
I know a couple of other AC casters, just wondering, what stats are you casters out there most concerned about?<br>
<br>
Mine are<br>
Mana (Items which give pure mana)<br>
Resists<br>
Agi<br>
HP (items which give pure HP...not Sta)<br>
Int<br>

<br>
well, i'm not a pure caster, but i speak for the weakest of all three priest classes when i say, my main concern (despite wis and mana) was always hp, with ac coming next to it (and now that i can somewhat afford it, resists as well). i worked my wis to 200 while grabbing some nice extra mana as well and tried to not sacrifice hp or ac in the meanwhile. i would love more stamina and strength (and of course resists, but they are quite expensive, blue diamond jewelry comes to my mind), but it's not easy for me right now to get those stats as an extra while not sacrificing some of my current stats.<br>
<br>
i think the question &quot;why do you die at all?&quot; is an interesting one, i seldom, nearly never, died within the last 20 levels (i'm 51 right now) because i was oom (i'm not talking about raids going bad or so), but because i got beat on. mana's worthless if you are not able to stand a few hits. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ulleauaric.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lleauaric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(5/2/01 1:56:34 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.eternalwrath.net/members/lleauaric.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I Don't get it......</span><hr size=1> Hmm well I guess that depends on your style of play<br>
<br>
Being a wizard, If I catch aggro, Im doing one of 3 things<br>
1. Casting Concuss<br>
2. Rooting and Moving<br>
3. Stunning to allow tank to taunt and then Concuss<br>
<br>
So for me, Agi is important so I can regain concentration after the cast<br>
<br>
A wizard is the most mana dependant class in the game, unlike a Necro who can create mana from self. Being that 200 int was passed a while ago..  raw Mana is very important to me.<br>
<br>
Resists..  This is more of a personal things.. my guild tends to do a lot raids so I need to have buffed resists for almost every type on a daily basis<br>
<br>
As Far as AC and HP.. I can see where you are coming from... but take for example fighting in the kobold caverns in Velks lab..  A Icepaw Champ hits for 200.. He hits me for that and he hits a warrior in full cobolt for that MOST of the time.  My Ac is never gonna be high enough to make a difference and my HPs are still best increased by Hero and Symbol (prefer Potg or Aego...but hey).  I keep Manaskin on for a buff and hope the Chanter or Shaman has slowed the mob to a degree that if I do aggro I can slip casts in between blows <p>Lleauaric Fyrewynd<br>Evoker<br>Knight of Eternal Wrath<br>Ayonae Ro

They leave the way it is so that those of lvl 46 to 54 or so have a place to go and do a raid and get some decent armor.
