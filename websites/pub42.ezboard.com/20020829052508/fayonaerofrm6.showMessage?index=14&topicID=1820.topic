I have shouts (which I think were off) and ooc in another window that goes with other spam chat channels hits, spells, etc. Stuff scrolls by very fast there, nor do I normally watch it.<br>

I suggest you get back to Karnors for EQ 101, sub titled game dynamics Risk Vs Reward. <br>

You lost control of the situation and died?  The risk was all yours, not hers.  <br>

I didn't expect her to rezz me first, I expected her to tell me (or one of my groupmates) "yes I can come to rezz you" or "no sorry, I need to leave asap.". Got it ? <br>
<br>
But she's got spammed with tells between times my groupmates asked and the time she came back, her groupmate was afk, so she couldn't know that she was ignoring me, or, I am sure because I know she is a kind person, she would have at least reply to say "sorry, I can't", bad luck to me. <p><br>

She didn't and doesn't and you don't understand it.  Doesn't matter if she got the tells or not.  She owes you jack, now if you wanna come sniveling here in NAG then expect bored folks like me to comment.<br>

<br>
This is what we/I saw from our side (NOTE: this is not a flame, I want to show you our point of view):<br>
<br>
We got trained.  Two of us (sk and sham), make to zone, the other two (war and dru) die.  Druid died to fast or we would have made it.<br>
At zone, a group is fighting in front of us.<br>
They kill their pray, and one of them loots.<br>
There is no spam.  There is no fighting going on.<br>
I use say and ask if we could get a rez, and willing to pay.<br>
Within 15 seconds after the say, I get healed by the shaman in our group<br>
Get the message of the person who trained us who apologized<br>
Replyed to his message<br>
See the two clerics moving to a sitting position<br>
Send 1 tell to Meya asking if she would be interested in helping with a rez.  There was no demand for one.<br>
Zone back to move the bodies to zone.<br>
Return out in ME, the shaman has sent tells to both clerics and used ‘say to once again ask if we could have a rez.<br>
We are told by Snapin that they are both AFK<br>
I sent a tell to Snapin asking if he could tell them once they return from afk if we could ask for a rez.  His reply is that he will ask.<br>
The people I see there are Meya, Vinre, Krni, Snapin and his alt enchanter and not sure what other.<br>
We wait at zone, while the two clerics return from AFK so we can get a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer.<br>
Twenty minutes for all of this to pass, and enough time for our two group members to arrive.<br>
What we see is the meeles running to Dawnshroud Zone, and the casters gating one by one right in our dead friend’s faces. No comment, no answer.<br>
Our thought is they could at least have been polite enough to give an answer.  If they had no wish to help they could have told us. We didn’t demand for help, we didn’t expect to be helped, we politely asked.  The reaction seemed a bit too dramatic for something that could have been fixed with a simple refusal.<br>
We wouldn’t have asked if there was the possibility to have clerics in our guild to help.  No clerics on unfortunately at that time.<br>
<br>
About being prepared, considering where we were fighting, we had a good group (WAR, SK, DRU, SHAM).  Accident happens to even the best prepared groups.  Not many of us can afford two or more accounts so to have a cleric/enchanter/wizard mule to follow us everywhere.  <br>
<br>
Of course this is what we saw from OUR side.  There is no way we know what the other side is doing or saying.  Anterak acted to hastly in posting his note and I wish he would have vented on our own guild board, but regardless that, had the situation been reversed looking at it through our eyes the way we saw it, I am sure the people involved would have reacted the same way. <br>
<br>
And in no way someone can say that would never happen to me. Or I always make sure we are well prepared for those situation.  I have been playing this game since it came out and I have seen even the uberest of guilds end up in similar situation.<br>
 <br>
Vinre, I apologize for Anterak getting upset at you.  In no way he, or us, expected you to rez him.  Unfortunately since we sent you tells, and you disappeared from us, considering that your group was well aware of our situation and we asked the members to please ask you when you where back, our conclusion was that you had no intention to help.  Which was ok with us and I want to make this clear once again, since ppl have the habit of twisting things to what pleases them the most.  We just would have liked a clear no answer.  Our assumption, as it seems, at least for your side was erroneous.  So please accept my apologies to you.  Just please try to understand our reaction considering our point of view.  We asked, we didn't demand, we hoped for an answer,  negative or positive, we didn't get one.  We waited patiently.  We didn't spam you with tells.  <br>

Judge the people and their post, don't judge my guild you idiot. You have yet to get to know anything about us before you should start vomitting all over the place. I judge poeple due to the experiences I personally make, and I have yet to see you in the zone as us when we raid or do whatever. I know you like me as much as cow shitting on your head, but this doesn't give you the right to start your own little sick flamewar against my guild as a whole.<br>
EW are great guys, they reach a lot. I am not friends with a lot of em, but I sure respect them for what they reach out there. They just have a couple of complete idiots in their ranks. <br>
See, I make a difference.<br>

<br>
About the topic itself.<br>
I'd advice to just let it drop. That cleric wasn't too nice, yet no reason to freak out about it. It was his right to leave, he doesn't own anyone any rezzes.<br>

Sadly I've been in zones with you and yers Taino.  The trains that ensued were legendary jokes.<br>
<br>
That, however was and is not the basis of my ire for You sir.  You've earned your stripes in my book of tards.  Congrats , wear them with pride.  For if I ever have the fortune to catch you in a zone that flags you as a target, yer worm fodder.<br>
<br>
As for your guild?  I've had my share of run ins even while not in zone with them.  From some goon of yers sending me hate tells when my price of an object I'm selling is higher than he likes, to another demanding cammo/sow for corpse recovery.<br>
<br>
So, yes I've yet to run into a situation where I look back upon yer kids as pleasent.  Perhaps this is just bad luck, personally I think it falls back upon their lack of leadership...<br>
