Yes, the smell could be overpowering, but in his 52 seasons of living, loving, and libations, he had never felt an all consuming headiness, in the lands of Norrath, that could compare to the cinnamon mead of India. Ahh...India, where the females of that race fawned over his short, sturdy stature and Jarg's body and mind had been awash with the sensations of dark sultry women heavy in scent and desire.<br><br>He snapped back to reality as the familiar clatter of plate armor grew louder and opening his eyes beheld a ghostly vision approaching him. He knew the form that coalesced as it approached as Rankur, but what were the strange creatures and devices he saw darting past his friend and guildmate in the distance? They were strange multi-colored creatures that spewed smoke from their tails and the ground they charged over was strangely uniform and almost metallic in color as dulled steel would seem.<br><br>Jarg quickly recalled an experience from some years back when his hunting party had found a strange well deep within a dungeon on Kunark. There too he had seen strange visions within the depths of the black waters filling the well and a wizard amongst his party had told him of parallel planes and the such. Jarg had thought the gnome touched but could not doubt the truth now before him as the apparition of Rankur jogged and jumped in his direction.<br><br>Just as Jarg prepared to yell out to his friend, the apparition began to fade - Rankur's face heavy with sweat and an odd smile pasted to his lips. Jarg had never seen such a deranged look in the man and shivered at the thought of its cause. He shook his head one last time and the vision was gone.<br><br>Jarg swore, brushing the experience off to bad Gnome ale, promising himself no such drink would ever touch his lips again. The thought of sugar and cinnamon against the soft, dark skin of Indian lasses warming his groin. He sighed deeply and tugged at his belt, taking a long soulful drink of some concoction he had purchased in Thurgardin. The taste was foul but his mind numbed appreciatively. <br><br>Stumbling toward his tent, Jarg began to sing in a longing whisper, &quot; Hari Krishna Hari Hari....&quot; <br><br>Jarg awoke with a start and he was not a happy dwarf. The scent of cinnamon and lustful women still lingering from his dream. His blanket peaked at an odd angle from his waist.<br><br>&quot;In all the names of the Gods and demons of Norrath, whoever hast awoke me from my fruitful slumber shall pay with their life!!!!&quot; he shouted. His head pounding with each inflection.<br><br>Rubbing his eyes in irritation, he noticed a strange glow filtering through the flaps of his tent as his sight cleared. Quickly grabbing his sword, Jarg lept and rolled out of his tent, hoping to dart into the darkness surrounding his camp. Planning to investigate the strange light further once in the shade of night, Jarg was surprised as his body began to spin uncontrollably. He had been done in by his own actions, having leapt into the very light he was trying to avoid. Jarg realized now that whoever had laid the trap had intended it so from the beginning.<br><br>Feeling his blood rush out to his limbs, as he spun erratically, Jarg felt the darkness of forced slumber creep into his mind. His last thoughts of the Elven wine he was leaving behind.<br><br>Jarg was standing. He awoke to this stance fully aware and ready to fight. Strange folk surrounded him, staring down with a mixture of fear and curiosity. Jarg growled a battle cry not really knowing why, since these humans wore no armor and bore no arms. Yet, the effect was gratifying as the soft skinned strangers screamed and fled in all directions.<br><br>There in front of him stood a structure such as he had never before seen. It was a mixture of brick and metal and shiny, magical lamps illuminated the front of this building in an eerie light. Above the entrance gleamed a sign. Jarg was not an educated man, as his education had been found amongst the battle field and tavern brawls. Yet, he could decipher words sparingly well when needed and the sign before him read, &quot;D-d-d-a-ai-r-r-y-M-a-rt ?&quot; <br><br>He walked slowly forward, drawn to the sign as if by magic. Sudden movement inside the building caught his eye and Jarg recognized a fight when he saw one. He also recognized the large shiny sign plastered to the clear crystal walls that marked the entrance to the D-a-i-r-y-M-a-r-t. Its bottle filled with a caramel liquid that no dwarf could mistake for anything else but alcohol!!<br><br>Leaping forward in a dead run, Jarg burst through the entrance of the tavern ready to aid the owner in his struggles, his mouth already watering at the thought of his reward.<br><br>He just as suddenly froze once through the entrance, as the sight of Jaraxle pilfering through a corpse's pockets and the body of Rankur laying alongside caught him by total surprise. He groaned. Realizing his chances of tasting caramel gold had slipped through his fingers, Jaraxle's silly grin brought him no pleasure. <br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=99.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=99.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=99.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=99.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.threadControl?topicID=99.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=99.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=99.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm13">Morrowind<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Diplomacy Corner<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Administration Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10>Roleplaying & GM Events</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
