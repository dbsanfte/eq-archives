<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Introduction</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp English is a language that has undergone a tremendous amount of change over the ages.  The Scandinavian Vikings that raided Great Britain ended up giving English a more Scandinavian appearance, much like modern Icelandic. The Norman invasion  in 1066 had a tremendous effect on the language. Latin and French was spoken and written in government and the court due to William the Conqueror. If it was not for the parliament opening in English, in 1326, the English language might have been entirely extinct. Modern English vocabulary consists of about fifty per cent Germanic (English and Scandinavian) and fifty per cent Romance (French and Latin). All these changes to the language have come from wars, conquests and conflicts but recently, we have seen it changing due to a new technology. The language changed when the printing press was introduced because spelling became fixed. For up until that time, the spelling of words had been somewhat flexible, but the era we entered only a little more then a decade ago, that of information technology, might change English as much as any previous event in the history of the language it self. In this essay, I will examine the effect that modern information technology and communication technology has on communication in English.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Earlier Technology</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp New technology has been introduced to us in many forms. E-mail, mobile phones and Internet are all things which virtually everyone has heard of, and most are using. One thing that all these methods have in common is that they all avoid face to face communication, similar to letters, newspapers, etc. When the telephone was first introduced, people where faced with having to interact with fellow human beings without face to face contact. One could simply not make judgements about people due to race, how they dressed, behaved and the class appearance they projected anymore. The only way this was still possible was through the accent, which somewhat shows what “class” an individual belongs to. This was still possible during the early phone era in the United Kingdom where status in society and well bred individuals could be identified with how they speak, although it was a lot harder in other English speaking countries such as the United States of America and Canada. Back then, proper English in the UK was defined by official broadcasting, the BBC, which started in the mid 20‘s. They chose to have people with a certain accent as news readers and reporters and due to this, they set a norm as to what was “good English“. Back then, every broad cast was a lot more formal then compared to today’s standards. Radio newsreaders even wore formal dinner jackets while on the air, even though no one could actually see them. Fortunately, the British English has now moved a lot closer to a classless language but there are still remains of the same language based judgemental attitude in England. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Internet, BBS’s and chatting.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp According to Robin Hamman , at the Department of Communication Studies at the University of Liverpool, The Internet started as early as 1957 in a project run by the Advanced Research Projects Agency, which in turn was created by the Pentagon. In its earliest form, the Internet we know today was simply a network that allowed early mainframes at universities, research centres, defence contractors, and arms of the military to share resources with each other. This network was known as the Arpanet.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The first virtual community was called the Msg-Group. It was created by two hackers simply interested in sharing computer files with each other and was located in California. The debates taking place on BBS (Bulletin board systems) were often heated and users began misinterpreting comments from other users as personal attacks, when they where merely comments on their statements, not insults meant for the individual behind. The online community was almost shattered by the misinterpretations which made flaming, i.e. insulting posts, frequent. The result of this was that,<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;on April 12, 1979, a rank newcomer to the MsgGroup named Kevin MacKenzie anguished openly about the &quot;loss of meaning&quot; in this electronic, textual bound medium. Unquestionably, email allowed a spontaneous verbal exchange, but he was troubled by its inability to convey human gestures, facial expressions, and tone of voice- all of which come naturally when talking and express a whole vocabulary of nuances in speech and thought, including irony and sarcasm. Perhaps, he said, we could extend the set of punctuation in e-mail messages. In order to indicate that a particular sentences is meant to be tongue-in-cheek, he proposed inserting a hyphen and parentheses at the end of the sentences, thus : - ).”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
(See Hamman, D. History of the Internet)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Mackenzie later confessed that the idea wasn't entirely his. He had originally gotten the idea from an old copy of Reader’s Digest, where the article was completely unrelated to computing. Due to his post, he was flamed and told his suggestion was ’naive but not stupid.’ He was also give a short lecture regarding Shakespeare's mastery of the language without auxiliary notation. ’Those who will not learn to use this instrument well cannot be saved by an expanded alphabet; they will only afflict us with expanded gibberish.’<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Even though Mackenzie’s ”smilies” received such a rude welcoming, they are about as well spread today as the English language is itself, if not more. They are used as an acceptable way to show emotions, indicating jokes and show general moods in online communication. For example, a user of an online message board might make a sarcastic comment and then end the post with a wink in smilie form, ”<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ”, indicating the humorous tone of the post. There are many different smilies such as sad, ”<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ”, happy, ”<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ”, and angry, ”<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> (” as well as countless others. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In the beginning of the nineties, Arpanet was surpassed by NSFNET that succeeded it as the largest network. NSFNET outgrew all other sub-networks that also came to be due to Arpanet. In 1989, the nodes of Arpanet where moved to the NSFNET network because the, at the time, 20 year old network was viewed as antiquated.  The NSFNET nodes and the cables between the nodes are today considered to be the backbone of what we today call the Internet. In May 2002, a staggering 580.58 million people had access to the internet (see NUA Online publication), that was 9.57 per cent of the worlds total population, so there is no surprise that online culture has had an effect on so many people. Though one should not be too surprised that the language spoken is English considering 40.7% of all internet users come from English speaking countries.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Email, electronic mail.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Since its invention during the creation of Arpanet, the use of email as a mean of communication has grown rapidly, both in numbers of users and in popularity. Today, it is a common tool within organisations and within society itself. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Linguistic research has been done on the use of email and Lee Sproull together with Sara Keisler (See Baron, N 2000: 247) state that the language of emails is often informal compared to traditional writing, particularly letters. A clear example of this is how letters are begun compared with emails. A traditional letter to a recipient which the sender does not know very well might start with “Dear Sir” whilst a similar email sometimes even do not have an equivalent introduction, but simply jumps straight to the point in a very blunt fashion, i.e. emails often do not have an opening paragraph either. According to Sproull and Keisler, email encourages personal disclosure, i.e. sharing information about one self, even personal information that would not normally be discussed. Email also has an ability to become emotional in a very negative way with so-called flame-mail. In such emails, swearing and generally poor English is often displayed.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The language of email varies as to whether the e-mail is meant for one-to-one communication or mass communication (one-to-many). The language of an email meant for mass communication is often more formal then it would be when the same information is sent to individuals, for example in a internal corporate newsletter. The only time mass communicating emails strive to sound less informal and more friendly is in advertising, i.e. spam emails where the sender tries to capture the recipients attention by using the language of an email that would be more likely to come from an acquaintance of the recipient then a company trying to sell their product.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When compared to a phone call or a letter, an email is viewed by most as the least intrusive way of trying to contact someone. When the phone rings, you have to answer it and reply to the person ringing. Answering the phone to hear the nature of the call and then hanging up if you are not interested would be unacceptable. Therefore you have to spend time replying to the caller if answering the phone. You do not have to answer an email, especially from a sender that you do not already know. When comparing an email to a regular letter, they both have the same advantages and features compared to a phone. But the major difference is that an email is not actually there in the physical sense. If you wish to discard it, you can do so by the push of a button. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Emails have replaced many of the functions of traditional phone calls. Sending an email is very cheap and even though it is in letter form it is almost as fast as a regular phone call, though it is only a one-way communication tool. As a result of this, holding dialogs through email is very time consuming. This is because the sender can not be sure when the recipient next checks his or her email inbox.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Because email is such a quick media and people view it as speaking through text, users do not often reflect upon the communication more than briefly but hastily type their initial response and send it away without reconsidering the matter, just like one would do in an oral conversation. The hasty reply also leads to a dependency on the spell checker in email applications just as it does in regular word processors and other IT applications in the computer era. More on this later.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The layout and format of an email often vary, not only the language it self. The language depends on many things such as the social dynamics between the sender and the recipient. The appearance of a text is also changed due to restrictions imposed by technology in formatting restrictions. The style may also be different as to what was intended because of the fact that emotions can not always be shown in an email. What the recipient sees as “flaming”, the sender might have intended as constructive criticism, but due to the way the sender wrote it, and due to not proof reading his email, he might have been able to avoid a misunderstanding.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Another change in format due to the new technologies is the change in length of letters and emails. Message attachments are usually longer in emails because it is cheaper to send compared to some other means of communication. When the telegraph was still commonly used, the fee was on a per word basis, rendering long messages very expensive. For business’, it is also cheaper to send large paper works per email then it is via the regular postal service because a large amount of papers would weigh a lot, therefore raising the cost sending it. There is no such cost per word nor data size when using emails, therefore no restriction in message length. Interestingly enough, emails still tend to be shorter then regular letters. This is often due to the fact that sending emails is an instant act and reaches the recipient quickly where as a letter would reach the recipient one or two days later.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp According to Naomi Baron in <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Alphabet to Email</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> (See Baron, N 2000: 241), emails are technically writing but it comes closer to speech.  “People sending email often reveal an editorial nonchalance, reflecting the casual tone of the medium and a psychological mindset (however mistaken), that email, like the telephone, is ephemeral.” What Baron is stating is that since people believe that sending an email is like a quick phone call or a quick chat, senders regard them with a “casual” attitude and take little notice to this such as spelling mistakes, carelessly phrased sentences, etc.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Perhaps the most interesting factor when regarding emailing is the fact people freely hand their addresses out. A good example is journalists who would never print their phone number at the end of a published article but don’t even consider the negative aspects of adding their email address by their name on the same piece of work. One usually finds it harder to ignore a phone call then an email. But is it really that easy ignoring certain emails and do these journalists really realise what malicious users can do once they have a person’s email address? A disgruntled reader can entirely destroy the “mail box” of the recipient (in this case the journalist) by sending thousands of emails per day. This is known as “mail bombing“. But it is still better then being harassed through the phone which can be a lot more annoying. Though one still wonders why one should bother, considering all the malicious people taking pleasures from causing annoyance and distress to, to them, unknown people.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Word Processing.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Word processing has always been a welcomed use of technology by most people around the world. It is easy to process, produce and format texts and the final production can be made to look professional with very little effort, even by users with not much word processing experience. There is hardly no effort involved in using a word processor. As a result of this, the negative aspect becomes quite obvious. Writers usually do not pay much attention to what they are producing since it can always be corrected and this has produced a tendency to cut out the pre-planning stage.  Compared to using a type-writer or writing by hand, where one must practically start over on a new page if there are any mistakes, the pro‘s of word processing are obvious for the lazy. Due to this, some authors choose to use old style type-writers or write by hand simply because they really have to think through what they write. Easy is not always the best and they seem to think that “If I might want to change it in a second, then its not worth writing down now”. Using that procedure requires a lot of discipline in the technological era we are in today. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Word processing, as well as other writing applications such as e-mail clients also have spell checkers built into them. They function as a great way to ensure that the user does not misspell words, produce faulty grammar, etc. But due to spell checkers, users do not always have to learn how to spell a word more then approximately and the automatic spell checker takes care of any misspellings, often without even consulting the user. This leads to the user not even knowing about his or her spelling error. Due to spelling checkers, language skills deteriorate and users loose their ability to spell. This is especially true for children growing up with computers. They often have problems writing by hand as well due to a habit of text typing the majority of their written work. Another problem arising from the use of spell checkers is the fact that a spell checker sees no difference between the sentence “I will get back two you after fore o‘clock” and “I will get back to you after four o’clock”. In this case the first sentence contain only words that are in the dictionary but with different meaning from those in the later sentence. The reason a spell checker would not complain is because the words are all in the dictionary, even though they are used in the wrong way i.e. out of context.      <br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Mobile phones and text messages.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With the popularity of mobile phones rising, not only as a useful item but as a fashion item as well, the overall popularity and spread of mobile phones have risen immensely. Sending text messages by phone offer the same strengths as email as well as mobility but the messages can be somewhat limited in size. The problem with text messaging is that it is still more expensive then sending emails. This is somewhat countered by the fact that a computer is often ten times as expensive when compared to a mobile phone, but even so, users are still faced with paying on a per phone call basis. And the size of text messages are limited, therefore they can not replace email.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Due to the limitation of the size in text messages sent via mobile phones, senders often try to shorten down their messages by using abbreviations. A lot of “teen-chat” language has been used more commonly due to this factor. Users tend to try and save time because it is harder to type with a phone keypad then on, for example, a computer. The chat language and abbreviations created due to the internet boom is once again used.<br>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Since it is sometimes hard to type, users ignore punctuation and capitalisation, thus the English language skills possessed by the user deteriorates even further. People even take short cuts by using numbers instead of letters where convenient. What are you going to do tonight. Can you call me later please? might turn into WOT R U DOING 2NITE CALL ME L8ER.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Mobile phones have managed to become a somewhat public nuisance due to people discussing private matters on the phone in public places. A person can hear the strangest things about the person on the seat in front whilst on a bus. They privacy one was used to when on the phone in ones home does not exist when it comes to mobile phones, though this is something that people do not always realise, as they discuss their personal life with their friend on the phone in front of a bus full of strangers.<br>
  <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Technical Jargon and its impact.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With the computer boom, information technology has entered the homes of millions of people.  But it is not always as user friendly as consumers would like the products to be, users are sometimes to learn about the new technology to a certain extent to be able to use it. Words used mainly by specialists up to recently have entered the homes of ordinary people, mostly through computer-interested children. For foreign people working with the new technology, the new words often pose a problem in themselves and this leads to other languages borrowing words from English and in some cases slightly modified so that they seem to belong to a foreign language more then English. For example, the Swedish word for a web site is webb sajt and the word for email is e-mejl. The spelling is changed to make the word seem Swedish yet the pronunciation is close to, if not exactly the same as the words English counterpart. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The technical jargon also leads to English itself spreading through users learning the words from their written form. As a result of only encountering words in their written form, people often get the pronunciation wrong. Since many words are “self taught”, people sometimes get the meaning of the words wrong.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Due to the Internet and global broadcasting medias originating from English-speaking countries, English has become the main language to communicate with online. As a result of this, there is a global English, without a country of origin, borrowing words from the different versions of English around the world such as UK, US and Australian English.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Conclusion</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Even if we are still faced with problems regarding how to “behave” online and off, we are still faced with another, perhaps more important, dilemma. Not regarding the English language itself but one regarding social etiquette. We need to learn how to use the new medias properly and by use, the technical aspect is not in focus but rather what messages should be delivered using what mean?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We are now facing deteriorating language skills, people having problems with the different levels of formality involved in communication and several possibilities of misuse and abuse due to these new technologies.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But due to these new technologies, it is easier to communicate with other people, and we gain a greater number of contacts in our own, social, networks, though perhaps more shallow. All these new technologies promote a global society where we can contact one another quickly and at a low cost.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What is today called the IT era is still asleep in its infancy, a force not yet fully awoken. We can not begin to comprehend the changes it has for our language and more importantly, our society itself. Our language is one of the very foundations of our society and if it changes with the current pace of evolving technology, we are about to see a major change in the different languages of the world.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp All means of communication that do not involve face to face interaction has in someway affected out society, whether it is through changing social interaction between people or through changes in the English language it self, and after this change, which is still going on, we still face the task of deciding if it is for better or worse. All we can say now is that there is a change, and all we can do is observe.  <br>

E-mail and email .. pick one format of spelling it and stick to it...<br>
<br>
It also starts off with short paragraphs and headings, yet near the end it just takes  off into a super long discussion.. the end does need to be broken down a tad more (Read FoG index here).<br>
<br>
Overall I enjoyed the reading (i did not know where the smilies came from hehe), and it was nice to see the treatment of our development from the written language on paper into the electronic media we all use.<br>
<br>
And to address that comment about those who feel smilies are bad.. to this day we have people interpreting the Bible. About Shakespeare's writing.. we still have different interpretations of his meaning too. <p><font face="Century Gothic" size=4 color=gold><b>Dashmoo</b><BR>

<br>
One obvious conclusion is that people use a lot more written communication.  Is that good or bad?  Do people become better writers as a result (heh, no)?  <br>
<br>
Truthfully, I think you'd have a hard time supporting a conclusion that technology reduces face to face communication.   <p>Mirdorr, 48 Bard
