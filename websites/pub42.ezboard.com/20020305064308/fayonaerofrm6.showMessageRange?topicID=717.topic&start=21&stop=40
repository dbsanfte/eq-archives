Yeah, there are four of you that have these opinions. Grats to that. And grats again, for there are many more. Like I stated in my first post, these attitudes are quite common. And that makes me very sad and angry.<br>
<br>
I have seen too many women, some of them close friends, getting treated like shit or eaten from the inside by fear that they would fall out of the cruel and quite random grace of the people around them.<br>
<br>
You people use a &quot;no, but&quot; way of speaking and arguing that I have seen way too many times and is really getting sick off.<br>
<br>
Sure, sure. Rape is never ok, harassment is never ok, rudeness is never ok, hurting people is never ok. No, no, no.<br>
<br>
BUT! Regardless of these general statements, there will always be excuses, always some way to make it the womans own fault and ending up with a moral of the story that the woman should be ashamed of herself because people are treating her badly.<br>

This is very important!<br>
Like you say, it's HIGHLY subjective.<br>
Yet people feel they have a right to force their subjective moralism down the throats of others with hurtful behaviour. <br>
<br>
If I decide that someone is too black for my taste, do I have a right to call her a dirty nigger?<br>
If I decide that someone is too fat for my taste, do I have a right to call her a disgusting load of lard?<br>
If I decide that someone is too sensual for my taste, do I have a right to call her a cheap whore?<br>

There are two trends in feminism that I find utterly disturbing. One is the idea that men is evil and everything is their collective fault. The other is that those women who don't fit into a narrow and moralistic view on sexuality are insane and have to be cured from their feelings. Bleah!<br>
<br>
I am a feminist, but my version of feminism is as follows:<br>
*Everyone have a right to be treated equally and as a individual.<br>
*Today, women are still not granted this right in our society.<br>
<br>
You say you are all for feminism, and yet you deny this simple basic. You do not want women to be treated equally.<br>

<br>
I have only gotten this shit indirectly, but it have been painful enough. Like when I'm with a close female friend who I really care about and who have had sex with me or some other guy, and she's building up angst about what certain people will think of her if they find out. One girl I was falling in love with had rational reason to believe that the people at her work would harass her to the point of forcing her to quit if they found out she had been with me. How the hell do you think that felt for her, how the hell do you think it felt for me??<br>

Yes, it is correct there is no excuse for rudeness, but you can't stop people from looking at someone whom may be dressing with sex appeal to think that they are in some way slutty, even though dressing is such ways may just simply make this person feel sexy and confident.  I am mainly talking about real life here.  For example, most of the time when a guy sees a nice looking girl in a sexy outfit typically the first thing that will come to mind is "WOW she is hot and I would love to get in her pants" or they may just think the girl is skanky for dressing that way.  How you dress is MOST CERTAINLY a reflection upon yourself.  IT IS!  <br>
<br>
So now, if you’re going to dress with sex appeal expect this.  That is truly all there is to it.  <br>

That dress do have a certain dominatrix flair to it. That's one of the things I like about it. On the whole, I think she looks beautiful and cool and powerful. Edeina is a great hero with all reason to be proud, and she proudly wear garments that is traditional in her culture. Leather is one of the basic designs, remember?

You have stated that you respect only those women who conforms to YOUR personal subjective views on what clothes females should wear, with who and how many they should or shouldn't have sex, and perhaps also when they should or should not smile, talk to strangers and so on.<br>
<br>
You disrespect a whole lot of people who want and deserve respect. And some of them are my friends.<br>
<br>
I don't know how far you would go in showing this disrespect. I hope it's not as far as many others. This is a discussion about this subject, after all. I brought it up. Maybe you wouldn't say things like these to a woman who hadn't brought up the subject herself? Maybe not even then, if the discussion was in RL? Maybe you wouldn't tell a abused girl that she shouldn't have worn that miniskirt. Maybe you wouldn't tag along when your friends decide to show a quote slut unquote what they feel about her. <br>

<br>
The line goes between interest and disrespect.<br>
<br>
If you think someone looks hot, by all means look.<br>
If you don't, then don't.<br>
<br>
People who make themselves visible should expect to be seen.<br>
<br>
If you get interested in someone, of course you want to show that interest. But you should either do it in a respectful way, or not at all. And don't get intimate if you don't think you can respect your companion afterwards. There's nothing worse (well, not much anyway) then people who use other people for sex and then discard them and disrespect them. Or like in the example earlier, scoff at strangers who don't provide you with the pleasure you desire.<br>
<br>
Surely it is somewhat strange that women get called whores both for not having sex at all, and for having it just because they feel like it. They shouldn't be called it for either.<br>
<br>
Oh well, I have ranted enough for a bit.<br>

 Edeina, your posts usually had some sense, it's why I &quot;labeled&quot; you as worth an opposing response. You couldn't handle it, it seems. Capital Letters as well, you must have ....shrieked your statement? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I in no way said anyone deserves to be treated badly. I believe there are methods of projecting one's self that invite, or &quot;dare&quot; a negative response. (I do not by any means believe any response is merited. Read that twice.) Rebelling against society's labels is also going to get the same result. Making it known you don't agree with common labels and the standards that lead up to the label, won't help you much.  You see, we mustn't imply that I treat people badly from my post. A dangerous accusation to make from reading my messages...which I hoped were very clear. I do not agree with Edeina, yet that does not make me &quot;one of those&quot;. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
In fact, my messages are all about &quot;Projection and Representation&quot;. <br>
<br>
Anyways, you read my post, and due to your feelings you had before it, threw it in with some other line of thinking generalized by perhaps a group of men who have hurt you or caused you pain. I will be your avatar of shovanism, gladly. Unintentional therapy can be quite good, and you don't even have to pay me. <br>
<br>
Now, here we go. Believe me, it will be clear. All your pain aside, it seems you have made the standards of what is &quot;cheap&quot; and &quot;sleezy&quot; something that is created by my own blind views shaped by Western Culture. (I want you to try to read this once, and try not to post something irrational in response if you do, I find &quot;fuck you&quot; dull and tired.). Who knows, perhaps in Sweden the role in which a woman is treated is far worse than the United States. Are there more women in Sweden who complain that they are being labeled as &quot;cheap and easy&quot; undeservedly?<br>
<br>
In your unique version of Utopia, we imagine a city where a prostitute  can walk around in public masturbating , while grinning coyly at men with a look that screams &quot;behold how sexual I am&quot;. Now, in this Utopian world, all men would tip their hats in respect, because this woman is in fact &quot;a woman&quot; and regardless of the message she is displaying with her representation of herself.....we should respect her like anyone else. No biases. If your friends you care about have problems maintaining their reputation, and are labeled as &quot;cheap&quot; or &quot;slutty&quot;. I have no pity for you, or them. I believe firmly in the individual woman's ability to gain respect. I've seen proof, and I know how it's done. I also know how that respect is lost. Responsibility. It's a tough burden. So, a woman has a choice. Wear the uniform of a sex object, or do not. If you behave invitingly, you will eventually invite. If it turns foul, and the invitee behaves poorly, blame will be shared. However, the role of the one inviting must not be ignored. Reputations are not given irrationally, I want to brand that into the cerebral cortex of the sympathizers for women presenting themselves as sex toys not being responsible for anything. <br>
<br>
Can I walk down the street, stroking myself in the nude, while winking at passing women? If this made me feel good, is it wrong? Why is it wrong? Because I don't meet up to YOUR standards? Because western society has made my sexuality something I should hide in my pants? Well to hell with you ! To hell with you all ! you go to hell ! You go to hell and you die ! Hell beast ! freaking hell beast !<br>

That's not how it's going to work, Edeina. These standards arn't mine alone. These standards don't belong to 1000000 people. They are generally accepted and recognized by countless cultures, people, societies. Nyidia made a reference to the uniqueness of sexual acceptance in cultures, seemingly enlightening us on how biased we are due to our own culture. In fact, I'm well aware of the means by which many cultures view sexuality. Western Culture is quite advanced in our methods of dealing with sexuality and providing a means by which a woman can get respect. Certainly, we're all aware of the atrocities of the Taliban governed societies. I think it's great that you all recognize that and are outraged. Now, lets stop comparing that in any way to what we're talking about. <br>
<br>
Edeina, you wern't raped. You were playing Everquest, and your cartoon was displaying a commonly accepted projection of something generally &quot;nasty&quot;.  You play the same game we all do, and we can spam this board with instances where we came across a player who acted rudely, or in a manner that warrented one of us being &quot;offended&quot; by what we read.  An everquest player surprisingly told you what he thought you looked like. <br>
<br>
I've been told I appear as a chunky lizard, or something similar to the evil reptiles from the 80's Saturday Morning T.V show &quot;Living in the Land of the Lost&quot;. Because my standards of what a chunky lizard must look like (due to my exposure to Western Culture Media) I whole heartedly agree. While I don't appreciate everyone coming up to me and labeling me as such, I accept the reasoning that brought the rude statement out. After looking at myself....I am a bit on the chunky side, I could use a little work. <br>
<br>
You see, regardless of what these people think. I believe I'm a beautiful Iksar, noble and wonderous. I won't conform to their views of what a lizard SHOULD like like. (I shrieked out the word &quot;should&quot; for emphasis on how strongly I feel about that sentence)<br>
<br>
(again...absurdity.)<br>
<br>
Life is a game. Life deals you cards. It gives you a hand to play with. Play your hand well. <br>
<br>
<br>
No one likes being called a whore. It is, by many culture's standards rude to go out and point at someone you feel is presenting themselves in a &quot;cheap&quot; manner such a word. It's bad. Please, try to avoid it.<br>
<br>
Nyidia, your post mentioned as well that a woman may feel confident, and powerful by dressing sexy. I agree. <br>
<br>
As well, there will be a consequence for using that form of expression based on your sexuality as a means for projecting your character to society. You must take responsiblity for the means by which you present yourself. Much like the naked cowboy in New York city. What message does he recieve for the manner in which he portrays himself? Is there a reason? <br>
<br>
Women are aware of their sexuality. Men are aware of their sexuality. Sexuality is very important in our culture. Having the ability to project your sexuality in a responsible manner is one of the most admirable traits one can find in a person. <br>
<br>
I sincerely hope I've hurt no one's feelings, or brought forth unpleasant memories. Consider me biased because the hand I've been dealt has been played well, and I've surrounded myself with a great number of fellows who have in turn matched by game play. Creating the illusion that it is possible to beat the game. <br>
<br>
And That, is why I believe in forms of sexual &quot;Representation and Projection.&quot; The consequences, reactions, and labels implied are obviously reasoned. <br>
<br>
Make no mistake, I do not smile upon any form of sexual aggression on the female. If I learn word of a prostitute being sexually aggressed in a rude manner, my blame will lay heavily on the aggressive male. I will, while investigating also consider the role the victem played in instigating. The question will come forth &quot;why on earth would you project that image?&quot;<br>
<br>
They are never unaware of the image, a woman knows what she's advertising. <br>
<br>
There, mixed with my previous two posts. My message should be clear, and realized as not only inoffensive, but reasonably sound. <br>

 And for the record, I respect women. I respect women who want to be respected. <br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Uhm, nope.<br>
You have stated that you respect only those women who conforms to YOUR personal subjective views on what clothes females should wear, with who and how many they should or shouldn't have sex, and perhaps also when they should or should not smile, talk to strangers and so on.<br>
<br>
You disrespect a whole lot of people who want and deserve respect. And some of them are my friends.<br>
<br>
I don't know how far you would go in showing this disrespect. I hope it's not as far as many others. This is a discussion about this subject, after all. I brought it up. Maybe you wouldn't say things like these to a woman who hadn't brought up the subject herself? Maybe not even then, if the discussion was in RL? Maybe you wouldn't tell a abused girl that she shouldn't have worn that miniskirt. Maybe you wouldn't tag along when your friends decide to show a quote slut unquote what they feel about her. [/quote]<br>
<br>
Now, I quoted this, not neccessarily to respond...because it's not entirely rational, and generalizes or assumes something that I in no way said. So, as I ponder it, I believe it links to something in your life that hurt you . So you take my message and generalize it to encompass a way of thinking similar to that which hurt you. <br>
<br>
Ahh, here I find a message. You said &quot;YOUR standards&quot;. I am honored that you would find my standards to be unique. This is simply not true. In my belief of responsiblity for the projection of one's sexuality, I believe it is you who may hold a somewhat less popular perspective which I can understand, as it relates to a relationship you've had that failed. You feel cheated by society. I am the embodiment of the method of thinking that cheated you (in some respects). <br>
<br>
&quot;My standards&quot; are not irrational, or hard to embrace. I can see an &quot;attractive&quot; girl, and I can see a &quot;cheap&quot; girl. There is a very obvious and notable difference, and one may be surprised at how many in my culture possess views that are similar to me. Most of our oppinions are in fact formed in relation to our culture or sub-culture, so it's not too difficult to find reasoning in that. Most of you reading this are subjective to my culture, so it's implied I am not basing this on the standards of a South American Pigmy tribe's beliefs. There is no need to try to define &quot;what's cheap&quot;. We are all capable of defining messages and understanding the messages we communicate.  It is too easy to feign ignorance. &quot;How do you define 'good'? &quot; and so on. <br>
<br>
I don't respect a woman who presents herself in a manner that &quot;cheaply&quot; exploits her sexuality. <br>
<br>
Now, the only way to prove to you that I respect women, is to have dinner with you, with women who know me. But there is of course the possibility of those women being prostitutes who I paid off to sit and lie for me.<br>
<br>
(crap....more absurdity)<br>
<br>
Now, I have plenty of information to give on what it is about my fellow man I don't respect.

To Palimax: You may be able to spot the 'whores' driving by them in your car at 40mph, but do you go out of your way to shout ugly epithets at them as you go by?  Do you think that insulting people based on their appearance is acceptable behavior in the real world?  If not, when why should it be so in EQ?<br>
<br>
I think that this thread has gone way too far off topic, and some of the responses I have seen make me very sad, but I think Febreeza summed it up nicely:<br>
  <br>
Whatever your personal opinions are, there's no excuse for rude.  <br>
<br>
If we were discussing whether someone's *behavior* was lewd or blatantly promiscuous, it might be another story, but it wasn't.  Someone looked at Edeina's character, made a snap judgement, shot off their mouth, and it hit a nerve and Edeina's feelings got hurt.  Let's try to have a little respect for our fellow-travelers on the server, shall we?

I think you're confused.<br>
<br>
I don't think insulting anyone (blindly, anyway) is appropriate.  I simply think that there are situations where someone's dress clearly defines their role and expected bahavior.<br>
<br>
Someone dressed like a slut on Van Buren street in Phoenix they're probably a whore.  Someone dressed like a cop, and it's not halloween or a Villiage People reunion, is probably a cop.<br>
<br>
If you're insulting women in EQ because they're wearing a &quot;slut's uniform,&quot; try to remember the context.  They're probably not standing on Van Buren street a block from my house. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4868>Palimax Sceleris</a>,

But...<br>
<br>
You determine how you dress, you know how you will be treated, you accept the &quot;consuqiences&quot; of your attire.<br>
<br>
No its not nice, no its not an excuse, but when you KNOW how your dressing, its your own damn fault(partially), if you dont wanna be treated like a whore, stop dressing like one.<br>
<br>
&quot;i should be able to dress anyway i want..&quot; blah blah blah, thats FINE, and you can!. But accept the consequneces of your attire.<br>
<br>
The male/female/whatever mentality over sexy dressing is 50percent at fault, the rest lies with you.<br>
<br>
If you dont like way your treated..dress different...should be that simple. If you like way you dress and dont wanna change, accept the consequences and realize what people are gonna treat you like until theres a miracle and we all get along. <p><a href="http://www.darusgrey.com"><img border="0" src="http://www.darusgrey.com/darussig3.jpg" width="432" height="120"></a></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/utreistaania.showPublicProfile?language=EN>treistaania</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/16/01 7:31:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=717.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sexy does NOT equal &quot;for sale&quot;, ok?!!!</span><hr size=1> i can not understan how you guys link Dominatrix with hooker...  <br>

(hitting the backscroll) and proceeded to tell me what had just happened...  He was sitting at the teleporter to the Nexus as his human female monk (wearing her gi, we all know about the costumes for monks, right?), when this male woodelf came up to her, spent a couple of minutes obviously checking her out, and said 'Hey hon, what's up?'  Giella replied 'I'm not your hon'.  Simple and to the point, please don't bother me. His reply: 'You could be if you're lucky...  I've had cyber (sex) with barbarian females...' She ignored him in the hopes that he would give up, but he persisted, making several more crude emotes, and she replied 'You never would (get lucky) with a patronizing attitude like that...'  He replied: I like a woman with balls...', and Gi, chuckling a bit, bit her tongue and decided once again to try ignoring him.  *Still* possessed of the belief that because this attractive toon was waiting here near him for a teleport, that he had a right to continue to harass her, he began to get angry and said: 'You're just jealous because you've never had a real man...'  She replied: 'I didn't know that woodelves *had* men.'<br>
Suddenly a lightbulb clicked on his head and, instead of assuming that *any* woman would dare to rebuff him in such a way, he said: 'You're a man, aren't you?' to which my partner truthfully (and with some pique at this point) said 'You are correct, sir'.  <br>
<br>
I don't think I have to tell you what happened next - this person spent a good several minutes calling Gi a 'homo' and generally making a spectacle of himself, until the porter went off (in fact, his rather embarassed friend had to drag him out of the teleport field, as he was too busy yelling at her to notice).<br>
<br>
Now to tell Giella, or anyone else who plays a character where the best-available clothing to them at their class/level is rather revealing (as I said before, if you are a female half-elf out of the box, or in leather for that matter, what choice do you have? /rude Verant), to 'put on a robe' or they should just expect this kind of harassment is simply ludicrous (not to mention that, for non-caster races, there simply *is* no robe option - a robe turns into a transparent top).  In the several months since my male partner has been playing two female characters, he has learned more about the ugly reality of sexism and the double standard than I could have ever explained to him in a thousand rants...<br>
<br>
In a perfect world, people would all treat each other with respect, regardless of the shape or color of their skin. <br>
We all know that's not going to happen, and that people are going to make judgements about other folks based on their appearance, but I don't think that that makes incidents like the one I just related acceptable behavior, either.<br>

Harry Hines also is the main drag where the prostitutes hang out (or drive about, on cold winter nights), and my partner has actually experienced harassment *from* the prostitutes when they drove up next to him at intersections on the way home from work, because he didn't want to 'party'.  So clearly, harassment goes both ways, but it doesn't make it a good thing...<br>
<br>
We do have a ludicrous 'aggressive panhandling' ordinance in Dallas, but it doesn't stop them, or the more mundane panhandlers that frequent the area, needless to say. <p><HTML><BODY>
