Vision had intended to move to the following plan to schedule it's planar visits.<br>
<br>
Visit the planes on 2-3 day maximum half-day trips only, GIVING advance notice.<br>
<br>
Example:  Vision will be visiting the Plane of Foo on January 12th-13th starting at 6pm.  Please plan accordingly.  If you are in the zone and wish to coordinate movements, please contact Tolnik.<br>
<br>
Unless someone proposes a plan that (a) doesn't lend itself to favoritism (a council is neat and all, but it'll never meet with universal approval), and (b) doesn't leave people waiting 6 months to visit the planes, this will probably be our plan of action. <p><img src=http://www.goodnet.com/~matts/sig.bmp > </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/usanterre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Santerre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/19/00 8:51:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> Many many people from Solusek Ro still need planar gear.

Now, we see guilds with members in full Kunark armor clearing a plane just to get to a boss mob.  On CT, alliances of smaller guilds rarely had a chance to kill a god, because the spawn time is static.  Let's acknowledge the fact that some guilds monitor the spawns closely and put themselves in a position to kill a mob shortly after it spawns.  Not a problem unless it means stepping on the toes of another group.  We also have to acknowledge that some people simply don't care if they infringe on another's raid.<br>
<br>
Maybe this will be different on a new server, but I doubt it.  What I'd like to see is better communication between guilds, and perhaps this is the place to do just that.  If a guild needs to get an epic item and plans to raid a plane, they could find out who will be in the zone and work out an arrangement.  Chances are, something can be worked out.  Usually, a bad siutation is caused by a handful of people who aren't reasonable.<br>
<br>
It's possible I'm being too optimistic, but that's just me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ufilatal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Filatal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/19/00 11:03:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Conesus--- FFA planes or schedule</span><hr size=1> Honestly, for the most part the planes are semi-outdated as far as armor drops, Fear/Hate armor is only marginially better to being much less than PoG/Thurgadin/Skyshrine quests.  And most guilds that can do Fear/Hate can probably muster the strength to complete the other armor.  The old planes are mostly for epic quest now, at least in my view, with a few god drops actually still being worth the time.  Hopefully once people realize this, we will see some movement out of the old planes ( except for patch day, when I still expect to see several groups move on the gods for epic quest, hopefully some maturity will prevail and people will work things out at that time ).  But with the number of large encounters out there at the moment hopefully the higher level guilds won't have to run into each other's plans too much.<br>

I think things like raid boards and posting &quot;I'm going to be in Fear on from X date to Y date&quot; only creates friction.  <br>
<br>
Believe it or not but you CAN have more then one guild camp Hate and Fear without training one another.  On CT we used a calendar system for the longest time.  During its time there was nothing but flames back and forth about one stupid thing or another.<br>
<br>
Finally after the calendar was abolished CT went into a FFA system and in one night all the problems of the calendar were gone.  People were actually TALKING their issues and concerns out with other guilds zoning in.  Working out stuff like &quot;ok we will clear left of temple and you guys clear right.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Now that said I agree that perhaps a *rotation* on Trakanon and likewise dragons seems fair. You can't share a dragon like you can a plane.  A dragon is a mob and not a zone.<br>
<br>
UDL won't support any kind of plane reservation system.  That said if there is a guild present we will always be courteous and respectful of their camps and keep our distance.  <br>
<br>
I strongly suggest that before we start regulating everything that we take a month or so to see how FFA on the planes works.  <br>

<br>
I don't particually like the method of scheduling planes like we tried on So-u-suk Ro. #1 only about 30% of the ppl used the board and #2 only 50% of those that used it even respected it. The idea of scheduling a Plane's raid four months in the future, only to have 4 other guilds show up does not appeal to me.<br>
<br>
Here's a crazy idea that most likely won't fly but who knows. Let me preface this by saying I totally support my guild and friends as I know nearly everyone here does. Those of us with planar armor had help from many ppl. <br>
<br>
What I suggest is have the guild leaders discuss the type of planar armor their guilds lack and what they have.  If the majority of guild A's members have all of their armor except a few folks, then why not have the ones who need armor team up with those in guild B that need armor as well? Wouldn't there be more bang for the buck if a warrior without indicolite went in place of one in full indicolite or cobalt?<br>
<br>
Sure we all want to help our fellow guildmate if we have full gear, but are we really helping them? If more plane gearless folks are in the planes, there should be much less armor that rots, therefore more ppl are getting armor. The more ppl who get armor, the more new people could get a chance at the planes in a timely manner.  Basically, get your armor and get out.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, this would require alot of trust, compromise, and communication among all the guild here. There is also the epic quest pieces and the gods, etc.<br>
<br>
Anyway mull it over, flame it, ignore it, etc. =)<br>

Things that can cause a LOT of friction with doing the big mobs is the fact of timezones. Some guilds are us-based, some are euro based. <br>
<br>
So US will probably say that Euro-guilds have an unfair time advantage on big mobs and things like that. <br>
<br>
To not have a rotation makes it VERY hard for some guilds to even have a shot at a big mob and will cause a lot of irritation in the long run.<br>
<br>
No one should have the right to &quot;reserve&quot; a zone, but I believe we should keep it polite enough to have everyone capable of doing a mob getting a shot at it. Id hate to see a few/single guild(s) monopolizing the big spawns and trying to get them to spawn at certain &quot;suitable hours&quot; for example.<br>
<br>
New and somewhat unexplored zones, sure, they should be ffa until a reasonable amount of knowledge exists on the server giving the guilds that feel that they sacrifice time and effort to gain unknown knowledge should be rewarded more than the ones that just read the spoiler sites and waltz in and claim their spot. How long this ffa period should be should be discussed imho. <br>
<br>
ffa is a bit like anarchy for me, there needs to be a lot of consensus to implement rotations and such but in the long run I believe its for the benefit of all. Takes a lot of diplomacy....<br>

Please don't equate the Council of Guilds (CoG) with the Karana Guild Central (KGC).  They were two separate entities with vastly different purposes.<br>
<br>
KGC = Planes schedules and tracking god rotations<br>
CoG = Promote player-driven events (roleplaying, storylines, competitions, zone raids)<br>
<br>
A number have suggested to me I should create a version of the CoG on AR to further along those ideals.  If I did, the first event would be a chess match in Butcherblock.  While various guilds did schedule a planes day and serve as a host guild (inviting the CoG), the CoG itself did not organize this.<br>
<br>
I know this may seem like a trivial thing to quibble over, but the distinction is important.  Yes, I'm biased because I had a lot to do with the CoG.  I hate to see it cast in a light which is not true to the purpose of the CoG. <p><B><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2 COLOR="#004080">Jzonn Stormwolf &lt;Unguilded&gt;</B></FONT><BR>

FFA is stupid.  There are at LEAST 5 trak capable guilds that moved and that is total chaos.

<br>
A rotation/signup similar to Karana or you are going to have to take patch day off from work to get a shot at anything.<br>
<br>
This might piss you off...and you might not believe me...but I have been on Karana since day one...and I know of 2 Trak guilds and 4 planar+ guilds that moved here...and I know SolRo and CT moved some great guilds too.<br>
<br>
Anyways it will take a few weeks...but it will all work out...anyone want to go up to POS so I can finish my Celestial Fists?<br>
<br>

My apologzies then, I always assumed they did the samething.  Something like the CoG then is a good idea, I've always liked an active server. :P  I just always heard CoG when it came to things like the planes/gods and assumed they had something to do with it also besides helping out.<br>
<br>
Maybe a we need to seperate the Trak/VS type guilds, from the guilds that are Dragon/Planes going. It may take some sort of cross between ffa and a signup. Depending on how many Trak/VS guilds, maybe Trak and VS will be FFA, and planes on a signup basis, or the other way around. *Shrugs*<br>

what about something like this?<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Hate:  Guild A  on 1/1/2001 through 1/2/2001           <br>
Fear:  Guild B  on 1/1/2001<br>
Air:   Guild C  on 1/5/2001<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->If guilds limit their time in planes and such to under 3 days, and can only have one entry in the table at a time, then things *should* run smoothly.  (In the above, Guild A couldn't add another entry until after 1/2/2001)<br>

Just my two silvers (cause coppers are worthless with this inflation)<br>
