I meet up with a former guildie (Xain)  He had told me about a strange toon crying the blues about losing his staff. Toons name was Mallaus (or Malluas) i noticed briefly that his named changed to GM green and also to something other than Mallaus... upon doing a /who Mallaus all nothing appeared (name was spelled corectly as he was still infront of me at the time) This was NOT an NPC, because his responses took time to develop.  anywho...    Xain succeds in finding the staff that merchant Uuaas stole from him (bought it from Uuaas) and returns it to Mallaus who then changes from gnome to inky and makes with the fireworks shouting &quot;HAHA  Bertoxxulos lives!!!  or some crap like that.  some how Mallaus dropped the wand and Xain picked it back up, when Mallaus asked for it back he refused. i asked for the wand and then put it in trade to Mallaus, but hit cancle after he hit accept, then taunted him further by destroying it and telling him so, which he promptly dispelled all of my buffs (player's cant do that unless in duel  or grouped right?)   <br>
So that is my contribution to the strange goings-on round Norath<br>

As I was doing my Karana scouting tonight, I happened upon some strange events in South Karana. Am not sure what this has to do with war, if anything, but figured you would like to know anything amiss. Three named undead gnolls, Triza the Dead, Gezra the Dead, and Braza the Dead up and started wandering around. The strange thing about this is that high-level characters could not kill them, and it was up to a few 20ish PCs to wipe them out. My partner Yarlin and I were attacked a bit south of Infected Paw, as Triza said,&quot;Join us in DEATH. Join us in eternal PAIN.&quot; 2 Were confirmed dead, leaving the leader Triza at large. I asked if any notes or scrolls were found, but no clear answer was recieving. Anyhow, I'd hate to think that the gnolls are involved in the great War to come, but coincidence seems too unlikely in these final days of peace.<br>

There is a new NPC in felwithe i noticed about a week or so ago in Traveller's home (new to me anyway) upon talking with him he mentioned that he had been summoned to return to this world for some reason. ( I had talked to him at length, but thought nothing of it till now) i am poping into the game now to talk with him again and i will post my findings.<br>

OK I just checked this guy out, and am pretty darn sure that he has some important info... i cannot post the text from game like i have seen other do in these post, so if someone wants to do that i think it would benefit the campaign. I will post some of my findings - lost of text is left out to save time of writing it out, but this is the gist of conversation.... <br>

<br>
Tripple amount of Qeynos guards<br>
(all serve Kane Bayle - evil brother)<br>
This is a fact and very conerning. Since the srhine of Bertoxxulous inthe Catacombs is VERY big and filled up with strong and mighty evil persons, I assume that the evil forces would actually have not the slightest problem taking over the Lead in Qeynos.<br>
This is a very concerning danger. I can only think that the reason they didn't take over the city yet, is because they are waiting for another Event to happen or a certain confirmation.<br>
But Qeynos needs to be protected. Immediately and with powerful armies.<br>
We also should send a spy frequently down there as well as our informants through the city.<br>
<br>
Servant of Mayong Mistmoore found wandering<br>
within Lfay, asking questions about FV's<br>
arrival home and reporting back to Mayong<br>
Mayong has his part in this. No doubt. He and Lanys seem to be allied and with the power of Mayong Mistmoore, Lanys will have a full army ready at her hands to bring Firiona in danger.<br>
<br>
Carson Mcabe, once HH Lt, now seaker of <br>
BB Hammer, discovered in The Hole<br>
He seems to have allied with the Bloodsabres. He also takes place in many stories and his signs are sprad all over Norrath. He is after the hammer which we also need to not let happen. Carson is a weapon dealer and a Bloodsabre ally!<br>
<br>
I am also wondering about Neriak. It seems as if theres a division of sorts amidst royalty. The Queen doesn't approve of how the King hunts Lanys. Teir'Dal civil war in the making perhaps? We do know that the King and the Queen seemingly are opposing each other now. <br>
<br>
Heres a surmising theory to the aforementioned. What if the King wants to dispose his wife? What if Lanys is secretly his lover and to become the new king? How else would she keep &quot;getting away&quot; all the time? Anyone notice the heavy influence of Bertoxxulous thats slowly appearing in Neriak starting with the X'lottl household and the other items of note? Lanys also captured Ashteth, the seer of Innoruuk who is gifted with visions of Innoruuk's will.<br>
<br>
lvl50+ spawns in Kithicor during the daylight hours.<br>
We have seen them. We have names and we have screenshots.<br>
They are VERY powerful. The question is, what do they do there? Are they on the Kings side or on the Queens? Or are they a party on their own? Noone has been able to find any explenation of this yet. But for sure it is concerning. My guess is that they are allied with the King since the Queen seems to represent the &quot;good&quot; side of Neriak (if there is one). The King allied with Lanys as m^rumors say, the Queen is hurt. Since the DE's in Kithicor are KOS to everyone, they must be evil. If they would be on the Queens side, I suppose that at least other DE's would be able to at least talk to them or not be attacked. <br>
<br>
Infos about the DEs in Kithicor:<br>
Tasi V'Ghera with pet<br>
Brigadier G'Tau<br>

<br>
Coordinates: pos695 pos2416<br>
<br>
<br>
Usually plain stone structure by the<br>
named Treant in NK, covered in signs of <br>
Trakanon.<br>
Its not just a sign of Trakanon. Its the signs that appear EVERYWHERE. We have not been able to find an explenation of the sign yet either. But we suppose its a strong sign with an important meaning. Maybe used to teleport. <br>
<br>
Bertoxxulous markings found near the<br>
X'lottl mansion (in Neriak).<br>
This goes in the same example as the treants rock signs. I suppose.<br>
<br>
Tayla Ironforge, which has a deep part in the story was originally a friend of Ton Firepride. Ton helped Tayla move, or more to the point introduced her to Carson who in fact did the move. Again note all the smugglers and Carson's dark elf contact to them outside the gates. Carson moved her to Neriak where she ended up in the maidens fancy where she was picked up by a &quot;powerful merchant&quot;.<br>
<br>
Here is our link. Mare X'lottl. SHE was in the Maidens Fancy where Tayla was. The inkeep THREW the game of Kings Court on purpose. Why? Think about what we know about House X'lottl. The &quot;powerfull merchant&quot; was none other then the Haggle Baron of Cabalis. Tayla Ironforge is STILL there now.<br>
<br>
<br>
The gnomes!<br>
The gnome with Edril's amulet IS in the Hole. He has actually and physically been seen. His name is Nortlav the Scalekeeper. There have been seen gnomes in the plane of hate, several! A gnome has been seen at the release of the Plague in the Lands of Karana. Also have been seen gnome messengers around.<br>
Those gnomes SEEM to not have allied with anyone and just be the good people. but this is WRONG!<br>
Those gnomes seem to in fact be part of this. They are in the background and hardly show up, but if they do, they certainly are involved in very important happenings.<br>
We must send a gnome spy in the City of Ak'Anon and have him find out more. Best would be a gnome necromancer.<br>
<br>
There are those half gods (ooc GMs) appearing and giving quests or giving small bits of information.<br>
So we have that Dark Elf appearing at the entrance of Befallen giving the following informations to a helper within the discussion:<br>
- The source of the Plague is &quot;some gods and I&quot;<br>
- being asked about an attack on Qeynos this eve  he answered &quot;Not this Eve&quot;. Saying this he still agreed that there WILL be an attak on Qeynos.<br>
- There is &quot;a lot more to Innoruuk in Plane of Hate than just the simple diety&quot;.<br>
-  and that &quot;Bertoxxulous is just a Servant of Innoruuk&quot;<br>
<br>
So this means 3 things.<br>
Qeynos WILL be attacked!<br>
We need to gather some forces and finally REALLY clear the plane of hate tosee what is going on there. This is also because (3rd thing we know) Bertoxxulous is a servant to Innoruuk. If this is so, then Innoruuk, again, is our true enemy. We need to find out more about this as much as (in this case) about the TIer'Dal and Dark Elfes in General. Neriak and Kithicor again take a more and more important position in this. We must keep Innoruuk and Neriak in mind, besides Qeynos and Bertoxxulous.<br>
<br>
The other GM event I heared of lately (thanks Brax) doesn't give new information but certainly CONFIRMS!<br>
and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  if anyone still doubts in all this after the words of this GM, then you certainly are not just ignorant, but also completely blind!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
There was a GM talking about a SK in Befallen that should be killed to help Innoruuk. Here is the text.<br>
GM: &quot;Hail Trkahon. Are<br>
you a loyal servant of Innoruuk and do you want to join the forces of<br>
hate?&quot;.<br>
Brax's Guildmate: &quot;Sure I am on your side.&quot;<br>
GM: &quot;Then go to a befallen state and seek out a shadowknight traitor.<br>
He posesses a key. Bring me his key to prove your loyalty.&quot;<br>
Brax's Guildmate: &quot;I shal do so now and shatter our enemy.&quot;<br>
GM: &quot;Very well may hate be your guide.&quot;<br>
<br>
He goes, kills the SK and brings the Key back to the gate of Neriak: &quot;Hail M'Lord. The traitor was no match for me as hate was with me, here<br>
is the key you asked for.&quot;<br>
GM: &quot;Very good Trkahon, you have proven yourself to our forces. Take this<br>
gift as a sign.&quot;<br>
GM gives him a &quot;Enchanted Teir'Dal Bastard Sword&quot; (2HS 23/45 str +7).<br>
Brax's Guildmate: &quot;Thank you M'Lord. If you ever again need my skills call and I will be<br>
at your service.&quot;<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  GM: &quot;Watch for the sign, our forces are gathering and within the next month<br>
we shall strike against our enemies.&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
/ooc<br>
Then the patch message of the 30th May.<br>
There is not much to say about it all then, they are preparing the war with this patch. The first war, supposedly in Greater Faydark (but also Qeynos and Kithicor could be involved since the situation there is also very critical), will take place in my opinion IN THE WEEK AFTER THE PATCH!<br>
I will have to talk to our forces on the next meeting. We NEED to really place our forces during this week. We will NOT have time to start the whole teleport engine when this has begun. We will have to teleport, but we will NOT be able to teleport around 500 people around!<br>
/ooc out<br>
<br>
Lanys is seeking the Malevolence.<br>
She is out there looking for it knowing she wil not defeat Firiona without it. Do not help her with it. If she comes to you and asks you for help, spit in her face and go away. Report where you have seen her! <br>
<br>
There is a lady in Qeynos...Nerissa Clothspinner...her sister left her in the care of Kane Bayle. Has anyone talked to her or seen her recently?? I dont remember seeing her my last trip to Qeynos which is odd because she is usually everywhere. Perhaps she has something to say....perhaps not. But it does seem odd that her sister is located in the Karanas and also she is a ward of Kane Bayle yet knows nothing of his evil nature.<br>
The BLoodsabres want her sister Milea dead. They are afraid that Nerissa or Milea will talk and be a danger for the shrine of bertoxxulous. Maybe they both are not fleeing from the assassins. Namely Rithur Fullome is asking to get her killed. GO to the shrine to learn more about it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Three named undead gnolls, Triza the Dead, Gezra the Dead, and Braza the Dead up and started wandering around in south Karana. I have no explenation of this so far but the fear that this may be the first sign of the union between Bertoxxulous and Innoruuk.<br>
Gnolls are mostly Bloodsabres, followers of Bertoxxulous (note: INFECTED Paw), and who is the Lord of the death? Innoruuk. Very concerning thought! Maybe this is one of the kind we have to expect to fight in the Karanas in the war.<br>
<br>
<br>
The shrine of Bertoxxulous is not just very big, it is also filled up with many dozens of very strong followers of Bertoxxulous. Down there you find the Necromancer Guild, the Shadowknight Guild, the Enchanter Guild as well as numerous people that seem to be high priests of Bertoxxulous that seem not to directly belong to one of the Guilds. This is WAY bigger and stronger than the shrine used to be!<br>
Also what the followers in there have to say makes you think.<br>
Garuc Anehm says 'Kane Bayle and the leaders of this shrine all wish to overthrow the rule of Antonius Bayle. He, for power, and we for the glory of Bertoxxulous. From this city, our diseased lord shall appear and tread across the land spitting death from his mouth and deforming the land. His glory shall be eternal! <br>
<br>
<br>
Another thing we completely ignored so far is the fact that many hints point towards... Kunark. Obviously the Chardokian Royal Family as well as the City of Cabilis is well involved in all this. Rumors say that in fact Firiona Vie has been kidnapped by Iksars. We need to send an investigation team over to Kunark to check the city of Cabilis, the Field of BOne as well as Trakanons Teeth.<br>
Has anone gotten any informations from Cabilis? We need to inspect this further. After all was Firiona suposedly kidnapped by Iksars from Cabilis!<br>
<br>
<br>
This following talk has been mentioned several times, but just now I got aware of its importance:<br>
[Mon May 14 21:51:34 2001] You say, 'What has bertoxxulous released on Norrath?'<br>
[Mon May 14 21:51:34 2001] Roesager Thusten says 'Bertoxxulous is a vile creature who rules the Plane of Disease. His filthy followers are spreading their stain across all of Norrath. We fear they are already here in Qeynos. <br>
<br>
[Mon May 14 21:54:12 2001] You say, 'You speak of the Plane of Disease?'<br>
[Mon May 14 21:54:13 2001] Roesager Thusten says 'The Plaguebringers are followers of the disease lord, Bertoxxulous. We believe a sect of them now operates in Qeynos, but we need proof before we can act. <br>
<br>
[Mon May 14 21:54:25 2001] You say, 'What proof do you require?'<br>
[Mon May 14 21:54:25 2001] Roesager Thusten says 'Someone reported seeing a Plaguebringer roaming about in the hills near Qeynos. We have long suspected that their dark influence was spreading. I am searching for proof that they are now here in Qeynos. If you find anything, please bring it to me at the Temple of Life. <br>
<br>
So he mentiones the Plane of Disease!!<br>
This is the first sign all over Norrath that does namely mentoin this plane! Have you ever seen anyone in Norrath mention something that does absolutely not exist? I didn't.<br>
Also he asks for proof. Lets bring him this proof. We need to get Antonius Bayle listen to us. They need to get this proof so they can and WILL act! Maybe this can save Qeynos or at least wake them up. Qeynos itself seems to be still completely asleep. They do not know about hte dnager that comes from Kane, they do not know about the shrine. They need proof!<br>
<br>
S'raggs letter to Opal Darkbriar says that his forces are gathering. He is sending this to Opal Darkbriar. We need to find out more about Opal. What does he have to do with this? How would they and who would help them? S'raggs mentions the Lifers. These are obviously the Temple of Life's Followers. Do they know more? Did they find out? We must talk to them and share informations.<br>
<br>
<br>
The GM Event that Stimpie mentioned with the evil gnome (GNOME again!) sounds very special.<br>
The infos I miss in your reports is a) where did this happen and b) what happened after you got dispelled?<br>
I think you acted very good by NOT giving him the wand. (ooc: You may have lost a goodie from the GM for helping by doing so, brave soldier!) This for sure was what he did not expect. I would be really interested what happened after he dispelled you. <br>
<br>
Your other report Stimpie.- About this new person in Felwithe that told you he has be summoned to return to this world for some reason. This sounds like a very hot thing. Who in the wolrd would SUMMON people on this world (and who) if it would not be very important!<br>
Any additions are most welcome here too!<br>
<br>
<br>
There have been spottet many missionairies with notes, letters, cards, tactical maps...<br>
Looks like all Norrath is suddenly talkingt eachother. We need to stop these messengers! We need to get those letters and we need to read and see what is going on. So if you see any messenger or messenger to be. Stop them and find out whatever you can.<br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Please join the Council meeting next Friday (tomorrow), May 17th in South Karana. After you left the bridge from Northern Karana, turn left and the meeting will be on the hill. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
It is critical that we now really get to a point where we KNOW what is going on, that we KNOW where and when and especially WHO will attack. We need to start really placing our forces and also, we need MORE volunteers to help to find out more.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> PLEASE do read this post carefully and THINK about all those details.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Please help me to make a picture out of this all.

I have found a Tier'Dal in Neriak who also claims to have been summoned to Norrath, by Innoruuk, to fulfill a purpose.<br>
<br>
[Wed May 16 22:19:04 2001] You say, 'Hail Vorshar the Despised'<br>
[Wed May 16 22:19:04 2001] Vorshar the Despised turns toward you with an icy glare. 'Hail Loriel , I am Vorshar the Despised.  I trust that you have important business with me?  Why else would you disturb one such as I when it is so obvious that I am a being of great power.  I was [selected] by Innoruuk himself to reside in the Realm of Heroes.  I have sacrificed many a mortal in the eyes of Hate and do not be so quick to assume that I would not be delighted to perform such a rite again.' Vorshar the Despised curls his lip in a twisted, sinister smirk. <br>
[Wed May 16 22:19:13 2001] You say, 'how were you selected?'<br>
[Wed May 16 22:19:13 2001] Vorshar the Despised says 'You dare to ask one such as I the will of the Hateful Father?! However, you do seem to be quite lacking in the field of thought and intelligence, which would easily explain why you have not heard my name nor of my [legend]. <br>
[Wed May 16 22:19:34 2001] You say, 'what is your legend?'<br>
[Wed May 16 22:19:35 2001] Vorshar the Despised says 'I, my dear witless Dark Elf, was chosen by Innoruuk's hand during the uprising and fall of the [Combine Empire.] When the Teir`Dal first began to discuss the decision to sign a treaty and join the Empire, I was one of the few who opposed siding with humans and the rest of the lowly creatures of this world. <br>
[Wed May 16 22:19:43 2001] Vorshar the Despised begins to cast a spell.<br>
[Wed May 16 22:19:47 2001] Vorshar the Despised begins to radiate.<br>
[Wed May 16 22:20:00 2001] You say, 'the fall of the Combine Empire?'<br>
[Wed May 16 22:20:00 2001] Vorshar the Despised narrows his eyes, blazing with hatred and a sinister amusement. 'The Combine Empire was a short-lived political structure of many of the world's races that fell shortly after my ascension. Innoruuk had found my faith and devotion to his word and his children so appealing, that he chose me to walk within the Hall of Heroes, although now, I have [returned]. To this moment, I know not why I have been given such a punishment as to again lay sight on and give ear to the grotesque, obtuse creatures of Norrath.' <br>
[Wed May 16 22:20:34 2001] You say, 'why have you returned?'<br>
[Wed May 16 22:20:34 2001] Vorshar the Despised says 'It is the Dark Father's will that I have returned to this realm. I do not question his judgement, nor shall I ever. His will is mine, and I do not question myself. The Dark Father wishes to expand his followers within the Realm of Heroes, and thus, I have been sent as more of a judge and jury for those who would consider themselves [worthy of Innoruuk's recognition] and divine favor. <br>
[Wed May 16 22:21:07 2001] You say, 'I am worthy of Innoruuk's recognition'<br>
[Wed May 16 22:21:08 2001] Vorshar the Despised looks at you a moment, his features emotionless beyond the searing impatience and hatred within his eyes. 'Then you have only furthered my faith in your utter lack of wit. Those who would gain favor with The Dark Father carry a symbol, a coin, that they must give to me for proper judgement. Without that coin, you are but another fool amid a sea of imbeciles.' <br>

(location pos2467, pos1026)It had a strange green/white flame burning in its center and was guarded by several Aviaks.<br>
<br>
Also I've been trying to find out what the symbols around the circle mean. The one on the bottom right is definitely the symbol for Erudin. (Or atleast is very much present in Erudin). <br>
I found the symbol on the bottom left on a rock outside Crushbone. My guess is that it is not the symbol for Crushbone itself but the symbol of an alliance that the orcs there have. <br>
<br>
On her patrols in Neriak the lady Loriel discovered the big symbol in the center, outside the third gate (the one for the necromancers and thieves guild). This symbol is likely to mean either Neriak itself or perhaps even Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately these remain guesses so if anyone has any more informations on any of these symbols please report it.<br>

<br>
I am under the impression that this war will not only occur in the Qeynos and Karanas.  I'm planning on defending my homeland and assisting my guild where needed.<br>
<br>
I believe there will be a battle on Faydwer (probably in LFay after reading the patch warning), and plan on defending the lands of the elves and dwarves (letting the gnomes defend themselves).  Evidence is pointing to the possibility of an event on Faydwer, such as the circles in Crushbone and Mistmore, uber scale gm events being held in Lfay, and just the fact that the vampire's lab in Mistmore is open.  I've heard that the lab has not been open since the beta.<br>
<br>
On a side note, I've recently seen a GM tagged similarly to the previous two examples.  Purple and with a title such as The Dastard.  I don't remember the name exactly, but he was inside the entrance to Sol A about a week ago.  I didn't think anything of it or I would have hailed him before he bamfed out in an explosion.<br>

Well after watching Mummy Returns tonight, I'm in major fighting mode :P Ive just finished reading an hour of server messages, events, server boards, /tells, logs, lol and im in overload. Me thinks a lack of sleep tonight is certain.<br>
Heres some thoughts I'd like to throw your way, guys:<br>
We shouldn't defend Qeynos. <br>
I know, it sounds insane. I don't mean never, just not now. Mayong has spawned two times in MM, server wide, in the last 2 weeks. Lanys was last spotted in Lfay. FV returned to Felwithe the other week. Servant of MM wandering around Gfay, shouting messages to her master.<br>
I know theres a million other things all over Norrath, but I just feel that the first event WILL be the attack on FV's festivals. And it seems to me that the key players in this are all gathering closer and closer together.<br>
The WAR will not start until after the patch, trust me, it takes a major patch to prepare the zones for whats to come. But that doesnt mean to say that there isnt going to be battles after the patch, no, i think they will come first. <br>
We cannot have all forces spread over Norrath at a single time, thats no way to fight. In one concentrated place is how you fight. Not scattered in the wind. <br>
It may seem hard to predict the first attacks, but I think its possible.<br>
Im betting all my equip that the first of the battles will commence in GFAY, and i mean SOON. Don't go out this weekend...thats all im saying.<br>

<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail Lord Nethryn the Arbitrato'<br>
Lord Nethryn the Arbitrato bows at the waist, his manner sincere and regal with the soft smile upon his lips. 'Greetings and good day Sortilege , I trust that [you are well]?'<br>
You say, 'i am well'<br>
Lord Nethryn the Arbitrato says 'Excellent! It is quite a pleasant day, indeed. However, I am curious, and I do not mean not [to pry], but by what grace of Tunare have I the pleasure of your company? Perhaps you merely [travel], or is it [me] you truly seek? <br>
[You say, 'what pry'<br>
[Lord Nethryn the Arbitrato says 'There are five coins, five very specific coins, each of which contains a divine light and essence. Even the hand and eye of the most crafted rogue or artist cannot forge Honor, Insight, Gallantry, Tranquility, or Faith. <br>
You say, 'i seek you'<br>
Lord Nethryn the Arbitrato blinks in surprise, pride lighting up is face. 'I see. It has been some time since I have been called upon in this [realm]. I am afraid that I cannot leave my [post], however, I shall pray for Tunare's guidance to the answers you seek.' <br>
You say, 'what realm'<br>
Lord Nethryn the Arbitrato says 'I am Lord Nethryn the Arbitrator, once a devout priest of Tunare, and now a most loyal servant. I once resided within the Realm of Heroes, but she has called upon me to [serve] again as I once did within my mortal form. <br>
You say, 'who serve'<br>
Lord Nethryn the Arbitrato sighs heavily, a look of trouble and sorrow upon his brow. 'Several centuries past, during the first years of his majesty's rise to the throne, I served as the High Priest of Tunare and was head of the [council], that most dreadful council. I do not regret my past work, as I did what needed to be done then. It was all for the benefit of our people, both Fier'Dal and Koada'Dal alike.' <br>
You say, 'what council'<br>
Lord Nethryn the Arbitrato says 'The council I served upon was a council of five priests and a single knight, all of which were devout in the most sincere meaning of the word to the Earth Mother. With the rising [activities] of the most vile Lord Mistmoore, the council was placed as a judge and jury for all who had become infected with the [disease]. <br>
You say, 'what disease'<br>
Lord Nethryn the Arbitrato says 'The Vampire Lord Mayong Mistmoore, who continues his tyrannical and monstrous rise in power within our neighboring forest, had begun to manifest his power in attempts to further his dominion over the continent of Faydwer. In the lord's attempts, he unleashed the lycanthropy virus upon the forests, infecting many of our nation's people. In time, the virus had been eliminated and was no longer a threat. The [souls] of those who were unfortunate enough to meet the council did not survive, but were avenged. <br>
You say, 'what souls'<br>
Lord Nethryn the Arbitrato says 'There were too many to count. . . Far too many condemned souls. There was nothing we could do for them but ease their pain and assist to keep the virus from spreading to the other inhabitants of our nation. No cure existed, and to this day, a cure continues to evade us. I still remember the [last victim] that I had to condemn before Tunare chose me for ascension. <br>
You say, 'what last victim'<br>
Lord Nethryn the Arbitrato 's eyes swell with pain and fury. 'A young girl by the name of Khasra was the youngest that our council had to attend and judge. I will never forget her face, nor the voice of her pleading mother. Forever I shall regret that decision, and regret our ignorance of her [threat].' <br>
You say, 'what threat'<br>
Lord Nethryn the Arbitrato says 'The young girl's mother had threatened to take Khasra to the lord's domain and seek a cure there if we did not further our search for one. She would not allow her daughter to fall to the same fate as all the others. We ignored her threat, and in turn, the girl now walks as a servant of Mistmoore, eternally embraced as one of his monstrous creations. I pray with all the waking energy of my being for her, and still I know not why Tunare has chosen me for this [task and glory]. <br>
You say, 'what task of glory'<br>
Lord Nethryn the Arbitrato says 'I am a herald, a harbinger, and a judge of the Earth Mother. I have been charged with the duty to [accept] those who have won the favor of the gods and return to them recognition and reward for their deeds. <br>
You say, 'who accept'<br>
[Fri May 18 12:40:37 2001] Lord Nethryn the Arbitrato says 'Those who have been found worthy in their deeds to accept recognition from the gods are given a [coin] that they may give to one of the many heroes and servants whom the gods have recently returned to this realm. <br>
You say, 'what coin'<br>
Lord Nethryn the Arbitrato says 'There are five coins, five very specific coins, each of which contains a divine light and essence. Even the hand and eye of the most crafted rogue or artist cannot forge Honor, Insight, Gallantry, Tranquility, or Faith. <br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail Lord Nethryn the Arbitrato'<br>
Lord Nethryn the Arbitrato bows at the waist, his manner sincere and regal with the soft smile upon his lips. 'Greetings and good day Sortilege , I trust that [you are well]?' <br>
You say, 'i seek you'<br>
Lord Nethryn the Arbitrato blinks in surprise, pride lighting up is face. 'I see. It has been some time since I have been called upon in this [realm]. I am afraid that I cannot leave my [post], however, I shall pray for Tunare's guidance to the answers you seek.' <br>
You say, 'what post'<br>
Lord Nethryn the Arbitrato says 'I am Lord Nethryn the Arbitrator, once a devout priest of Tunare, and now a most loyal servant. I once resided within the Realm of Heroes, but she has called upon me to [serve] again as I once did within my mortal form. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It seems that [activities] gets no answer, only the Coin answer, and I could find nothing to ask with [pry] that made him react. <br>
<br>
As I understand this, He is the giver of one of those coins... didn't give me any quest or same tho ... <p><b>Sortilege Wolfsoul, druid of the 45th season, follower of Tunare </b> <Br> Member of the "Clenched Fist" <Br> Ayonae Ro Server <Br>

<br>
Today, on the Zebuxoruk server their was an exciting GM event that took place. I remember reading about Fironia Vie's return on another server, so when I heard she was seen I immediately investigated it. I followed a group of around 20-30 people who were all following Fironia Vie until she stopped and talked to a unicorn. She then led the grop to the faerie village where she gave four stones to four specially selected people who took on the surnames based on the elemental stone they were given (rock, fire, earth, and water) I have no idea what this did to the recipients, but a little there afterward Fironia Vie performed a 'ritual' which eventually resulted in appearance by Tunare (I have some cool screens of the event too.)<br>
<br>
Afterward, people continued to be amazed and awed, but after time several negative messages regaurding the approach of something ecil were displayed, and at the climax of it all Cazic Thule, the Faceless himself appeared. At the time I was only a level 12 paladin so I didn't have a prayer against him. I found this out the hard way after bashing him once, he hit for 680 damage. The unicorn fought as well, but it got cursed and I think died later on. Afterwards I spent a while trying to get my corpse.<br>
<br>
By the time I reached the faerie village it appeared that there was just some closing dialogue to be said, and since I had mostly just been observing I left and returned to Felwithe, where a certain character (I forgot his name but it started with an R) was congratulated by what I believe was an NPC general of a sort. It will be cool when I can actually participate in these events instead of just watching.<br>
<br>
I took some screenshots of the event you should be able to see here as well.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
GO check it at www.everlore.com. The screenshots are awesome...<br>
but on another side... This sounds very concerning actually to have Cazic Thule being summoned in Fawdyer, kinda out of nothing.<br>

I'm beginning to wonder, if they're the ones who hand out the coins for heroic deeds, does that possibly mean there will be a battle at each site the coin is handed out at?<br>
<br>
To my knowledge, there is not one apperant in Kaladim, Kelethin, Surefall Glade, Firona Vie, Thurgadin and Halas.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure about the Grobb, Freeport and Ak'Anon.<br>
<br>
But there is one in Qeynos, Felwithe, Ogguk, in or near Cabalis, and in Misty Thicket.<br>
<br>
Now, mind you, I haven't seen all of these that I'm sure exist so I don't know where they are located.  I've seen the girl in Qeynos and the one in the Thicket.  He makes me wonder tho.  Why is he in Misty Thicket and not inside the town of Rivervale?  If there is going to be a battle at these cities (assuming this of course), is the battle for Rivervale going to take place in MT and the other battles take place in the same zone as the coin givers?  This theory makes sense if an invasion force comes from within Qeynos/Qeynos Catacombs.  But if there is to be a battle within Misty, is it coming from the direction of Runnyeye?  I would have expected Kithcor first, but the Karanas lie in the runnyeye direction.<br>
<br>
This is just a theory I have, so don't get worked up over it.<br>
<br>
I wanted to be able to attend the gathering this evening, but RL is going to get in the way.  Please think about this and post some condensed notes so I will know what I have missed.<br>

[Thu May 17 23:05:48 2001] Malloy the Songbird says 'Very well then, Good Luck to you on your travels.  If you journey to Qeynos, you may want to speak to Jaylia the Faithful.  She has adventures of her own that she may wish to tell you. <br>

[Thu May 17 23:06:23 2001] Malloy the Songbird says 'Ah, excellent!  Would you like to hear about my [childhood] or would you like to hear how I was sent to the Hall of the [Realm of Heroes]? <br>
[Thu May 17 23:06:38 2001] You say, 'i want to hear about your childhood'<br>
[Thu May 17 23:06:39 2001] Malloy the Songbird says 'I was born Malloy Birtonel on a farm in the westerns plains of the Karanas.  My parents, Tralvin and Dortha, were very poor and struggled to keep the [farmstead] going.  Not being able to afford to have all of us in school, my mother taught my bother and I for one hour each day while our sister was sent off to school.  My younger brother and I worked the farm from sunrise to sunset with only an hour and a half for lunch and school in between. <br>
[Thu May 17 23:07:00 2001] You say, 'what farmstead?'<br>
(he was singing the next, that is, he moved about like a bard playing an instrument)<br>
[Thu May 17 23:07:01 2001] Malloy the Songbird says 'Our farm is bright and cheery, O how I treasure it so. <br>

[Thu May 17 23:07:25 2001] Malloy the Songbird says 'I would often travel to Qeynos at sunset after work on the farm was completed for the day.  I would stand outside the local taverns to recite poetry, while playing rhythms on an old raggedy set of tin cans.  I didnt make a great deal of money doing so but I earned enough to buy me this here finely crafted flute. <br>
[Thu May 17 23:07:55 2001] You say, 'what realm of heroes?'<br>
[Thu May 17 23:07:56 2001] Malloy the Songbird says 'Those who perform heroic acts in the face of the Gods usually get sent to the Realm of Heroes.  While I?m not sure what heroic act I performed, I was sent to the Realm of Heroes by a [vision of loveliness]. <br>
[Thu May 17 23:08:09 2001] You say, 'what vision of loveliness?'<br>
[Thu May 17 23:08:10 2001] Malloy the Songbird says 'While I traveled from Qeynos to Freeport, the most beautiful female I have ever seen followed along behind me.  When I tried to speak to her, she did not respond.  After one of my performances in Freeport, this beautiful goddess of a woman approached me, gently took me by the hand and guided me as we faded away.  I found myself in the [Plane of Music] where a concert was performed in my presence. <br>
[Thu May 17 23:08:31 2001] You say, 'what plane of music?'<br>

[Thu May 17 23:08:45 2001] Malloy the Songbird says 'Beauty of a goddess, a vision that can usually only be found in dreams. <br>
[Thu May 17 23:08:49 2001] Malloy the Songbird says 'Her long curly dark hair flowing in the wind . . . <br>

I am sure it is because ya wish t'buy a good spot of Jumjum and listen to my [tale]? Oh, quite lovely so! Why else would one well rounded Human come to see the great Bidils the Quickhand other than to hear of this rogue's great adventures? <br>
[Thu May 17 16:42:02 2001] You say, 'what tale?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:42:02 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'Ahhh. . . I see the gods have found the time to be now for a good ear to lend to my words!

Indeed, quite lovely so. <br>
[Thu May 17 16:42:15 2001] You say, 'what beginning?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:42:15 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'Yes, of course I shall begin at the beginning! No proper tale would begin anywhere other than at the beginning! You see, good Human, I was once a humble rogue. . .er, merchant within this here fair city. Oh, how the Jumjum and gol. . .um, [merchandise] flowed in then! Quite lovely, indeed, it was. Well then, where was I? <br>
[Thu May 17 16:42:34 2001] You say, 'what merchandise?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:42:35 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'Ahhh yes! Those days were fair indeed. How I do miss them! Of course, that is not to say that Bidils the Quickhand does not appreciate the eyes and favor of [Bristlebane] upon him! In fact, it is quite the contrary! I do love a good prank! Yes, quite lovely so! <br>
[Thu May 17 16:43:08 2001] You say, 'what bristlebane?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:43:08 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'Bristlebane, indeed quite the trickster and with a sense of humor! I bet you could not have seen that Bidils the Quickhand would have caught the eye of such a dignified individual, now did ya? Yes, The King of Thieves. . . and merchants finds it amusing when one takes his [possessions]! <br>
[Thu May 17 16:43:28 2001] You say, 'what possessions?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:43:28 2001] Bidils the Quickhand 's eyes grow wide with an eager, child-like anticipation. ''Oh yes! Upon one of my several adventures through this great, glorious land of Norrath, I did stumble upon a [lovely treasure], indeed! Great skill and cunning was used, skill that belonged only to Bidils the Quickhand, and has yet to be surpassed within this realm!'' <br>
[Thu May 17 16:43:46 2001] You say, 'what lovely treasure?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:43:47 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'A lovely gem, far more beautiful than even the most delicate and furry feet of a halfling lass! It was larger than my face, and sparkled more than the most pure of Jumjum catching the rays out of Karana's blessed skies! Indeed, it was a divine treasure to behold. . . but little then did I know that such a treasure truly belonged to the King of Thieves. . . and merchants himself! But no, such truths still would not have [stopped] me! <br>
[Thu May 17 16:44:29 2001] You say, 'so you were not stopped?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:44:46 2001] You say, 'what stopped you?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:44:46 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'Ahh ha! I was not stopped, and the gem was mine! Right from beneath the nose of Bristlebane himself did I take it! That was when he noticed me. . . and that is when I was taken from the humble life of a merchant and placed within the glorious [Realm of Heroes]! Of course. . . Bristlebane took back the gem. What a shame. Indeed, quite so. <br>
[Thu May 17 16:45:52 2001] You say, 'what Realm of Heroes?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:45:52 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'The Realm of Heroes, that is my new home. . . Well, it was. Ahhh, indeed, it is quite lovely! It is where all who catch the eyes of the gods in favor ascend if their deeds be true and worthy enough for note! Perhaps one day, Namyra , you shall rise as well!! Look at Bidils the Quickhand, once a sturdy merchant and now a [humble servant] and rewarder of deeds! <br>
[Thu May 17 16:46:16 2001] You say, 'who are you a humble servant to?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:46:16 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'Yes! Indeed, a humble servant I am! I complain not for my occupation. . . as I am humble. I collect [deeds] and make [recognition] of those who have caught the eyes of the gods. Why the gods do it not themselves, I am lost for answers. . . but, I do not complain. They are gods, you know. Quite busy! Indeed, lovely so! <br>
[Thu May 17 16:46:52 2001] You say, 'what deeds?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:46:52 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'Deeds! Yes, the gods are quite tricky and intelligent, you know! They have found a way to mark deeds in the form of a coin! A coin which one who has been fortunate enough as to accept would give to me. . . or yo one of the [other Heroes] who have recently come to this land. <br>
[Thu May 17 16:47:09 2001] You say, 'what other Heroes?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:47:10 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'Oh yes! I am not the only one who has returned to Norrath in search of Heroes! There are many others, indeed! Although, as the gods, their colors vary. Some are [kind and gentle] while some are [vile and nasty] beings which ya should watch yer back for. <br>
[Thu May 17 16:47:56 2001] You say, 'who is kind and gentle?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:47:56 2001] Bidils the Quickhand sighs heavily, a twinkle in his eye and a warm smile upon his heavy cheeks. 'Yes. . . none so as Jaylia the Faithful, as she was so rightfully named. A lovely lass. Tender as a gentle morning mist. . . Yes. . . Indeed, quite lovely so. An enchanting creature. . . and as pure as Tunare's good grace itself. Maybe ya should visit her over in Qeynos an' hear of her adventures!' <br>
[Thu May 17 16:48:25 2001] You say, 'who is vile and nasty?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:48:25 2001] Bidils the Quickhand glares and spits on the ground beside him. '' I know not why some of these. . . villains are called heroes. It is all part of the plan, I am sure. However, I shall give ya this warning of one of them, perhaps the most vile of all, and that is Kizrak the Tyrant, a brutal creature of the Warlord who has quite the taste for halflings. . . and I mean not in the sense of good grace and kindness!'' <br>
[Thu May 17 16:48:50 2001] You say, 'what recognition?'<br>
[Thu May 17 16:48:50 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'Deeds! Yes, the gods are quite tricky and intelligent, you know! They have found a way to mark deeds in the form of a coin!

--What Jaylia the Faithful said:<br>

[Thu May 17 22:14:52 2001] You say, 'Hail Jaylia the Faithful'<br>
[Thu May 17 22:14:53 2001] Jaylia the Faithful says 'Greetings, Namyra , I am Jaylia the Faithful, daughter of Raiston and Launa Lightmist.  I was born in Qeynos while it was under the rule of Antonius Bayle III.  My parents were both paladins of [Rodcet Nife] and protectors of the city.  They saw to it that I learned the ways of the [Holy Knights]. <br>
[Thu May 17 22:15:10 2001] You say, 'who is rodcet nife?'<br>
[Thu May 17 22:15:11 2001] Jaylia the Faithful says 'Rodcet Nife is The Prime Healer.  It was he who sent me to take my place in the [Realm of Heroes]. <br>
[Thu May 17 22:15:18 2001] You say, 'what realm of heroes?'<br>
[Thu May 17 22:15:19 2001] Jaylia the Faithful says 'The Realm of Heroes is a place for those who have proven themselves worthy of being in the presence of the gods beyond Norrath.  My [act of faithfulness] destined me to walk amongst the other Heroes in the Realm.  Many of us have journeyed back to Norrath to seek out heroes who are deemed worthy of the same. <br>
[Thu May 17 22:15:35 2001] You say, 'what act of faithfulness?'<br>
[Thu May 17 22:15:35 2001] Jaylia the Faithful says 'My act of faithfulness came at a time when a dreadful plague shadowed the Qeynos area. The plague spread so fast the priests could not cure the diseased quickly enough. The City Council of Qeynos, with the approval of Antonius Bayle III, put into action a [plan] to end the suffering. <br>
[Thu May 17 22:15:48 2001] You say, 'what plan?'<br>
[Thu May 17 22:15:48 2001] Jaylia the Faithful says 'A group of warriors were sent out into the fields to kill each animal that was infected with the disease in an effort to keep it from spreading any further.  The few remaining [healthy priests] were sent out to maintain the warriors' health.  The priests became ill and had to return.  The warriors became infected themselves and struggled to perform their duties. <br>
[Thu May 17 22:16:09 2001] You say, 'what healthy priests?'<br>
[Thu May 17 22:16:09 2001] Jaylia the Faithful says 'With the exception of the High Priests who were too old to make such a journey, I was one of the only healthy priests who remained.  I traveled out into the fields where the warriors were and cured them as fast as I could.  As I worked my way across the plains, I began to feel a bit dizzy and realized that I had been stricken with the plague, yet I [refused] to waste my energy on myself. <br>
[Thu May 17 22:16:36 2001] You say, 'what made you refuse?'<br>
[Thu May 17 22:16:36 2001] Jaylia the Faithful says 'At that moment, I reached my hands up into the air and shouted, 'Rodcet Nife, Prime Healer of all!  Give me the strength to go on.  Too many have suffered.  These brave warriors have fallen.  My mother has joined you.  Please, allow me to go on so that I may assist the [remaining brave souls] before I, too, join you!' <br>
[Thu May 17 22:16:59 2001] You say, 'what remaining brave souls?'<br>
[Thu May 17 22:17:00 2001] Jaylia the Faithful says 'I continued on toward the remaining warriors.  Again, I cured them as quickly as I could. The tide of the battle slowly turned and the warriors began to defeat the remaining infected animals. There were bodies of fallen heroes and slain infected creatures as far as the eye could see.  I knew then that my [end] was near. <br>
[Thu May 17 22:17:11 2001] You say, 'what end?'<br>
[Thu May 17 22:17:11 2001] Jaylia the Faithful says 'I stood silently with my arms to my sides and looked out across the plains.  I raised my hands into the air once more and simply said, 'I am ready now.'  I then fell to the ground and was raised to the Realm of Heroes, newly christened 'Jaylia the Faithful.' <br>
[Thu May 17 22:17:30 2001] You say, 'what holy knights?'<br>
[Thu May 17 22:17:30 2001] Jaylia the Faithful says 'My parents provided me with a vast amount of knowledge.  I was taught the ways of the Holy Knights at the Temple of Thunder and the Temple of Life.  After the death of my father, I was sent to [Freeport] to study the holy ways of the Knights of Truth. <br>
[Thu May 17 22:17:44 2001] You say, 'what freeport?'<br>
[Thu May 17 22:17:45 2001] Jaylia the Faithful says 'Freeport is a trade city to the east of Qeynos.  A few years after going to Freeport, I received an urgent message from Qeynos.  My mother had taken ill and I was needed in Qeynos immediately.  When I returned home, it was too late.  My mother had passed away due to a plague created by [heretics]. <br>
[Thu May 17 22:17:56 2001] You say, 'what heretics?'<br>
[Thu May 17 22:17:56 2001] Jaylia the Faithful says 'Many years ago, after the Erudite heretics completed the construction of Old Paineel, they began practicing with unique forms of diseases.  These dangerous experiments were not confined within the walls of the dark city.  They expanded their research to the animals in the plains of Karana.  The resident high priests were forced to come up with a cure each time a new plague surfaced.  Years later,  after I started studying the art of curing, my mother was stricken by one of these deadly creations. <br>

thank you for taking the patience to read this, i don't know how much it has to do wtih the war but i think it's a very hot lead, especially Jaylia the Faithful, after all she died in a plague in Qeynos!<br>

a) someone posted that Giz X'Tin has disappeared, this is not true, i saw him striding trhu Kithicor yesterday<br>
b) i saw a hig lvl (red to me) wood elf called Kithicor in the Kithicor Woods, i have never seen him before, he didn't talk to me tho when i hailed him, altho i conned amiably to him<br>
c) this is no real news, just something i would like you to know, i raised my skill at fletching to 202 yesterday, which means i can nearly perfectly make even the best arrows and i can also make trueshots and darkwood bows with a very high success rate, so if anyone needs something of that, tell me<br>
