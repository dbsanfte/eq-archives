1. What if he/she didn't do it? Innocent people get thrown in prison quite a bit. That question is the number one reason I don't believe in the death penalty.<br>
<br>
2. We are one of the last few industrialized nations that still use the death penalty. We're living in the stone age. The Salem Witch Trials are over, people.<br>
<br>
3. Saves money? Wrong. It costs more money to put someone to death than it does to keep them in prison for life.<br>
<br>
4. As stated above, I believe life imprisonment is a harsher punishment than death. I view death as the easy way out.<br>
<br>
People say the prisons are overcrowded and the standard of living sucks. Well, <b>dont' go there</b>! I know what it takes to actually get thrown in prison for a long period of time, and it takes some serious effort. You are truely given every chance under the sun to stay out.<br>
<br>
Do you want to cut down on prison overcrowding? Legalize Marijuana. <p><FONT SIZE=+1><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13102><B>Biggins Black: Assassin</B></a></FONT><BR>

It IS cheaper to execute than to house, feed, etc etc, but all of the lawyer/court fees it takes to go through the process increases the cost exponentially.  If you've been found guilty and sentenced, you should get a single appeal IF you have new evidence of your innocence.  No appeal after appeal after appeal.  Tried, convicted. Appeal, convicted.  Plead the Govenor for a Stay of Execution, dead.  We dick around for entirely too long.  There is absolutely no reason any person should be on death row for 5, 10, 20 years.  Its ridiculous.  <br>

<br>
For the rest, single small cells without entertainment or any prolonged human contact works for me.  Given that my viewpoint above is unlikely to be introduced, this is a more likely option.  My sole issue with the death penalty is that it IS too easy.  There should be prolonged suffering of one sort or another, to punish if not deter.  <br>

It really sucks to get it wrong with the death penalty.<br>
<br>
Part of ANY system involving a death penalty will HAVE to involve massive appeals to be anywhere close to fair.  There is no way to have a &quot;fair&quot; death penalty that costs less than merely imprisonment for life.  <br>
<br>
On recreational drugs....criminalizing consentual acts is wrong in my book.  Discouraging them, ostrisizing the actor, perhaps even fines, sure, but making them criminal acts involving jail time only promotes disrespect for the law.  (Don't tell me you are going to be more likely to assist a police officer find a murderer when the evidence will also show you were dui or lighting a crack pipe at the time.  Maybe if the drugs were cheaper the addicts wouldn't rob liquer stores to be able to afford their next fix!).<br>

He fled for about a month before he was captured in florida, a good 10 states away.   <br>
<br>
Another True Story: These couple men(here in the United States), out in the mountains put adds in the paper about how they're looking for 'companions'.  When the people came to the men, they litteratly locked them up, and used them for sex slaves and made them do work and raped them..  Human beings, in America, being raped, enslaved, beaten, against their will, some of those people were fathers, mothers(yes, they captured men and women both).<br>
<br>
Then on their trials they show no remorse?<br>
<br>
Do the people who committed the crimes deserve a free home, with better food/room and board then what 25% of american's have?  <br>
<br>
Do future killers need a deterrant to keep them from doing the same crimes?  <br>

Unfortunately, so is prison.  Most prisoners have a higher standard of living than some of the more impoverished areas of the country.  If prison was 4 walls, a bed and a toilet, maybe it would be a deterrant, but the way it is now, some people are living better when they get arrested.  Cable TV, internet access, guaranteed heat, electricity and water year round, free education, three meals a day and basically all the cigarettes and drugs you want since they can't seem to control it - all better than you'd find in your average slum or dying mining town.<br>
<br>
If prisons were a place for punishment instead of failed attempts at rehabilitation, there wouldn't be a need for death as another supposed deterrant.<br>
<br>
As for DNA, you'll never hear testimony that says DNA proves 100% without a doubt that someone &quot;belongs&quot; to whatever DNA evidence presented, it merely reduces the number of possibilities.  In some cases that's close enough, but there was an interesting story on one of those A&amp;E crime shows a while back.  A man from a very small town (population around 500 and dropping) was commited of a murder in a larger nearby city.  He was convicted based on a witness description and DNA evidence.  On appeal, his lawyer did some checking and found something scary.  The town had been so heavily inbred several generations back that about 10 other men had identical DNA profiles and matched his basic physical description.  They ended up testing the entire town to check the accuracy of the results, and everyone who's family had lived in the town for 3 generations shared enough DNA to match as an immediate family relation. <p><img src=http://www.kaseyspace.com/EQ/nenasig.jpg align=center>

Notice how I'm going to calm down now hehe.<br>
<br>
My views on this, as with many other subjects of a philosiphical and social nature are what most people in this day and age would consider radical or communistic (when you think that, remember the quote 'i give food to the poor, and they call me a saint. I ask why the poor do not have food, and they call me a Communist.)<br>
So, I'll give you a little peak in to the nature of my perspectives on subjects such as these.<br>
I don't believe in black and white, in good and bad, in right and wrong. I believe that from birth human's know no different, they are social bodies waiting to be taught, to be shaped... Innocents, if you will.<br>
People don't do things for no reason, they are how they've been brought up, how the world has treated them. It's extremely scary the number of people that are clueless about the true power a messed up life can inflict upon people.<br>
So here we go:<br>
<br>
I'm against the death penalty. It could not be more wrong.<br>
For the practical reason, that people FOR it percieve death, murder, as such a brutal thing. However, they will inflict on the murderer, the exact same thing they are so 'rightfully' punishing them for. Do two wrongs make a right? I was always taught that they didn't. So, in essense, you are judging someone for taking a life against a persons will, only to commit the same act, and cover it with the label of justice. Advanced and civil societies SHOULD BE ABOVE THIS. It's primitive, it's brutal, and it's cold.<br>
<br>
Monsters. Human's aren't monsters, they are humans. We do thing for reasons, reacting to situations and past experiences. When a person commits a crime, murder, abuse etc, why don't we ask WHY? What can we do. Don't spill more blood, don't take more lives, let us be the bigger humanitarians, let us not banish our fellow humans, but help them. Sex offendors have had a history of abuse inflicted upon themselves. Murders are mental, brought up wrong, corrupt, mislead, provoked. People don't wake up one day and feel like a masacre. I'm sorry to burst your perfect black and white notions about everything.<br>
Reform, not destroy.<br>
But no, society now could never concieve of such a concept. 'Reform? Help? But, But.. isn't it cheaper to kill people? Because I mean, they're asking for it.'<br>
<br>
I'm going to deep here, I think I'll stop because I really can't explain my views clearly enough right now :P<br>

An abused woman who finally says enough and kills the man who has spent 30 years abusing her.  Sorry to disappoint your little example Taino.  But, these are not the people who tried under the death penalty.<br>
<br>
Those persons tried under the death penalty in <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> MOST</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> states are those who have commited crimes so heinous, as to be considered atrocities.  And those who are mass or serial murderers, killing usually FAR more than one person.<br>
<br>
We do have DNA evidence.  No it is not perfect, but it is damn near perfect.  And in most cases unless the match is 99% or close to it, then the person is usually acquitted.<br>
<br>
There was a time when it was actually a punishment to be sent to prison.  You gave up ALL rights when you were convicted.  Then, in steps the American Civil Liberties Union (whom I personally think should all be taken out and shot), and prisoners now have the right to vote, they have luxuries that most of the people who are working their asses off to pay for these lowlife scumbags, dont have and cant afford.<br>
<br>
We are paying through the nose for these scumbags to have cable, internet, a college education, what amounts to a health club.  When we cannot afford these things for ourselves.  Lets take ALL the luxuries away and make prison the punishment it was meant to be.  Or better yet how bout we spend all that money that they cost us, and use it to ship them to Sweden, and let the soft hearted, people like Halo reform their bad asses.<br>
<br>
I am sick and tired of pansy ass little whiners crying about how it is cruel and inhuman to not allow these <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> CRIMINALS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to have the luxuries they so badly need.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NEED MY ASS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> No one NEEDS the luxuries these <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> CRIMINALS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have.  Hell I live without it and I havent even committed a crime but I'm forced to pay for their BAD ASS to sit there not doing jack.<br>
<br>
For the crimes that the death penalty is intended for, I am for it.  But I, like someone previously mentioned, do not think they should have unlimited Appeals.  One, two, fine.  But, not unlimited.<br>
<br>
But then I also happen to believe that punishment should be just that, punishment.  We have an entire society of &quot;no, no Jeffrey dont kick that little puppy&quot; children who have grown into people who have NO CONCEPT of being responsible for their actions. <p><HTML><BODY>

It costs more to put them to death than to have them face a life a Prison sex. <br>
<br>
As far as stating that the death penalty is revenge. That is a bogus comment, atleast by the intent of the penalty as written. It is meant a deterent. But it is not a deterent. The reason being is that the death penalty is not carried out in Public and it is not Gruesome. <br>
<br>
Putting an innocent to death would bother me though. Hence the appeal processes and why it is so costly. Therefore why I am against it.<br>
<br>
Putting a Rapist/Murder etc... to death does not bother me in the least. John Wayne Gacee and Timothy McVeigh dying did not cause me one second of lost sleep. I could have tripped the switch on them myself with no problem.<br>
<br>
Also Taino have to agree with Glad about the DNA part and how clueless you are and how you like to twist facts to fit your arguement. Like Glad pointed out, in the US to convict in a criminal court it must be beyone a reasonable doubt. That means even the slightest bit of doubt and the gig is up, persong goes free. <br>
<br>
Oh well nice lively topic with some interesting View points. <br>
<br>
Also, for those who have not traveled much, been in combat, etc... Life is cheap to many people. You dont have to understand their thinking but just know it is cheap.<br>

<br>
It's soooo eassssy to say ... &quot;Awww look at the poor little oppressed person, Look what &quot;we&quot; have done to him. This must be the reason he’s doing what he’s doing. It's not his fault, there are other reasons you don't understand&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, Yes I do understand.<br>
<br>
I understand that there are opportunity costs for every action we make. Everyone is given the ability to choose. If one chooses to take a life, the opportunity cost is whatever they gave up to commit that crime, Freedom, Constitutional rights, maybe even life. &quot;You&quot; make a choice to make a crime. If I hand you a gun, tell you that your life sucks, show you why it sucks, and you kill yourself, it's YOU who pulled that trigger. Don't give me this &quot;its everyone else’s fault&quot; non-sense. In the end, you pulled the trigger, you. I think criminals give up their life *that's the opportunity cost* when they take life.<br>
<br>
Like I said before, giving up life doesn’t mean &quot;breathing.&quot; I think death is waaayyy too easy. Put them in Alaska, and have them mine, and add to the GDP.<br>
<br>
About costs –<br>
Yes, the only reason it “costs” more to execute someone is because of all the freaking appeals. Don’t spin the truth, if we executed someone after only 1 appeal the cost would be about 5 Dollars for a .22 and 25 Cents for a bullet. Don’t tell me the costs are higher to execute someone then house him or her for life, cause its bull.<br>
