However, despite what most ppl want to believe, Trakanon really isn't on any side, yet he is not neutral either. He serves his own interests, I guess it depends on a point of view. <br>
Also, your post gave me some real big things to think about. It was said in Steamfront mountains that Norrath is plagued by something bigger than the sleeper, something that has been here since forever. <br>
When you asked about Trakanon's origins, well he is not a spawn of veeshan or a descendent of anyone, he had always been on Norrath, before it was discovered, before the Gods arrived. Which leads me to think whether he is this other entity which is a bigger threat to Norrath. He did prophercise the end of Norrath, could he merely be, as you said, scheming and influencial? Big scary old dragon wanting nothing more than to die.. if he were to tell ppl the end of the world was to come, I'm sure ppl would get very worried, and start pointing fingers, get the ball rolling for an all out armageddon.<br>
<br>
For me Trakanon is the biggest question mark in all of this. Until we get more insight on his intentions, it's hard to tell his involvment. But you're right in what you said.. he sounds so noble in the EQ lore, yet he seems to be very.. &quot;shift&quot; as of late. Could he be getting grumpy and selfish in his old old old old OLD age? hehe<br>

Surely they can just dismantle it again after it destroys Lany's. Would it not benefit all parties that are trying to stop her? <br>
And maybe this counts for the lack of Innoruuk action on Norrath. Maybe he IS waiting for her to complete it, and when she does, and it kills her, BOOM, out pops Innoruuk to regain possession of his favourite toy.<br>

<br>
Of Carandril's death and Edril's journey to Antonica: <br>
<br>
At the age of 450, Carandril became deathly ill. The emperor fought death for more then a year before his passing into the next realm. High elves and wood elves crowded the busy streets of Felwithe for a full day to witness the funeral procession, and Edril was saddened greatly by the loss of his mentor and friend. As per elven tradition, when Carandril passed away a new emperor was chosen by the council and the new emperor, after being crowned, chose a new head for the imperial army. Edril was awarded estates in the surrounding imperial lands, a hero's send off, and a large amount of gold coins for his retirement wealth. Nobody, however, expected Edril ever to lay his sword to rest. &quot;He has the blood of a hero,&quot; emperor Carandril used to say, &quot;try as you might, you could never keep Edril from the adventure.&quot; Thinking there was nothing left for him in the empire of the elves, Edril gathered what wealth was given to him and set sail for the far-off human lands of Antonica. <br>
<br>
Arriving in the city of Freeport, Edril was recognized as a wealthy elf only. His name was unknown to these western lands, but that quickly changed. Edril became almost instantly renowned in the Freeport area for his fighting prowess, as he helped many of the villages along Lake Neriuss against the raider Zellain and his band of dark elves. His real fame, however, came as a desert fighter. Edril held a chief role in defending an outpost in the Kithicor woods against a large goblin attack, and it was during this battle that Edril became infatuated by the deserts of Antonica. Whether it was because they were so foreign to him or whether he loved the danger, Edril spent most of his remaining time on Antonica wandering it's deserts, from the eastern desert of Ro all the way to the dead hills in the west and the plains of Karana. His most noteworthy exploits in these areas included capturing Ragoth the sand giant and his &quot;dust marauders&quot; in the desert of Ro as well as flushing out an entire nest of frogloks around lake Rathetear. He soon was recognized back in Felwithe as a remarkable cataloguer of strange creatures, as he would write notes about all his adversaries and send them to the imperial library. As he made his way to Qeynos, he even fell in love with an erudite female mage named Almaril and they were wed. <br>
<br>
Of Almaril and Zisstrik the insane: <br>
<br>
For a time in Qeynos Edril forgot about adventure or Carandril or his home back with the elves. He loved Almaril deeply and she took him back and forth from Erudin to Antonica, teaching him everything he wished to know. He was as much interested in her crude but powerful magic as she was his graceful fighting styles. For the first time in a long time Edril was satisfied and happy, and to the astonishment of all it seemed that the elven warrior would actually settle down in Qeynos with his wife forever. But fate moves unpredictably and Edril was called into service once more. <br>
<br>
An old merchant noble from Freeport, a long time friend of Edril, sent him a letter detailing the problems he was having with a band of local trollish thieves. The thieves, however, were not everyday thugs. Goods from merchant caravans had increasingly been stolen to fund for a splinter trollish army somewhere in the desert of Ro. The army, whom the kingdom of Grobb wanted destroyed very much, was lead by an obnoxious would-be-preacher troll named Zisstrik the insane, who lead his band of trolls on what he called a &quot;religious crusade.&quot; Edril agreed to help with the problem. The troll bandits were easily found and easily dispensed with, but more important was what Edril learned during the hunt. Zisstrik spoke at length, before he was killed, about the troll dragon-god Trakanon and how the dragon told Zisstrik in his dreams to steal and kill the local human merchants who &quot;pollute the desert and the swamps with their presence.&quot; Edril dismissed most of what the troll said as crazy dribble, but he became increasingly interested in the tale of Trakanon. In return for the destruction of the splinter army, Edril only wished in payment that he be allowed to speak with the shamans of Grobb about the great dragon. The trolls, however bitter and tentative, agreed. <br>
<br>
Of Edril's research and his quest for Kunark: <br>
<br>
The elven warrior was immediately in love with the story of the troll heritage. He was fascinated by the idea of dozens of glorious armies dessimating eachother because of hunger and confusion, fascinated by the imagery of the far off and blasted land of Kunark, but even more fascinated by the character of Trakanon, a powerful being once a god to the trolls and only seen by a single chief. He immediately thought Trakanon was evil both for what he did to the trolls and because of what Edril knew about all dragons. The elf silently vowed to make the hunt for Trakanon his final and most glorious quest. Utilizing ancient trollish texts and learning what he could, Edril soon had plotted a course to and over Kunark. Almaril protested greatly and called Edril crazy for trying to carry out such a silly fantasy, but the elf couldn't resist the pull of perhaps the greatest adventure he would ever have. <br>
<br>
Leaving his wife sobbing behind him on the docksides of Freeport, Edril set sail for several weeks before arriving at what he hoped was the lost continent of Kunark. Frightened by the horrible site of the field of bone before them, the crew of Edril's ship told the warrior they would remain on the coastline until his safe return. Packing what he needed for a long and arduous journey, Edril made his way alone across the dead fields of the ancient trollish homeland until he arrived.at the jagged cliffs of Trakanon's Teeth. What happened next no one knows for sure, as Edril was careful not even to divulge it to his wife before his death, but it is rumored Edril had to escape many clever traps and fight through several horrendous challenges before reaching the throne of the great beast. Even then, he did not kill Trakanon because what the dragon had to tell him was of far greater importance then any quest. Herein lies the complete text of Trakanon's prophecy, as Edril himself never forgot the words of the great beast and later told his wife in order that the whole of Norrath may read the message: <br>
<br>
Of Trakanon's prophecy, excerpt from &quot;The Book of Edril&quot; by Edril's late wife Almaril: <br>
<br>
The great dragon looked on Edril as a father on his son and smiled widely. &quot;So,&quot; Trakanon spoke in a voice that shook the very ground, &quot;at last you have come.&quot; Edril, great among the elves, felt himself begin to tremble as he stared deep into the dragon's fiery eyes. &quot;You have no reason to fear me, warrior, even though you have come here to kill me. But I doubt that even you could perform such a task. You see, child, I was born before the stars were made, before the foundation of this world was ripped by Veeshan's claw, and before the gods gave birth to the elder races. I have been and always will be the eternal mystery between life and death and gods and man.&quot; With that said, Edril bowed his head in awe and somehow knew the great beast spoke the truth. &quot;And yet,&quot; the dragon continued, &quot;I am but a watcher. For while I claim this world as my own I am forbidden by laws forged millenia ago to change it's course. It is the curse of all my kind: to love a world so much and to have to watch it die. Take heed, warrior, because Norrath's death is fast approaching.&quot; Edril lifted his head, his eyes wide in a look of shock and fear. The dragon simply nodded. &quot;Yes, Edril, Norrath's fate was decided long ago, or so the gods think. But the visions of your gods are often warped by their own vanity and selfishness, the future is never set, and the elder races may yet prove them wrong. The gods made you all as a means to an end in their struggle and as the wars of the elder races escalate, so shall the gods descend from their planes of existence and make the whole of Norrath suffer. But there are those among the races untouched by the taint of immortals whom I have chosen as the saviors of man.&quot; Trakanon then stabbed deep into the ground with his left claw and ripped the bottom of his cave dwelling asunder with one powerful stroke of his arm. Edril looked over the sides of the newly formed chasms and noticed the walls glowing a bright red. A face began to form from the blackness deep within the cracks, and Edril could clearly make out the aging face of an old man. The face had sad eyes, gaunt cheeks, and long silvery hair. &quot;His name is Miragul,&quot; said the dragon, &quot;a human mage, gifted in all talents of magic and able to bend the laws of life and death to his will. He exists now as an empty shell, wandering his tombs filled with powerful magics.&quot; The next face that formed was that of a troll, but surprisingly it was a noble and proud visage. Scars ran from both eyes down to the troll's mouth, and the troll's eyes were strong and unwavering. &quot;He was called Nalikor. He was the troll first to enter my kingdom and find me. He ended centuries of brutal war, was greatest among his soldiers, and was able to lead his people from death and starvation to a powerful kingdom.&quot; The dragon then turned his eyes to Edril. &quot;You, elf, are my third chosen. You are Edril the warrior, a brilliant soldier and great hero. Death haunts you at every turn but you are always able to overcome your obstacles. You are a deadly fighter, a wanderer of Norrath, and a lord among elves. And now I award you with a much bigger destiny.&quot; Trakanon spoke deep in a language Edril couldn't understand, and suddenly a small pendant flashed into existence around Edril's neck. &quot;To Miragul I revealed the existence of artifacts that would enhance his powers in the arcane arts. To Nalikor I awarded a flaming sword to enhance his warrior prowess. To you I give this: a small pendant that will allow you to talk with me always. But it does much more. My strength is finite, Edril, and already my powers begin to weaken. Soon either the gods or the elder races will find the means to my destruction, and when that happens then the final war for Norrath shall be waged. But when I die, before I leave for the afterlife, I will impart my power to the bearer of this pendant, and he shall have all the wisdom and the strength of the most ancient of creatures.&quot; Trakanon then laid his serpent-like head on the floor of his cave. &quot;That time is fast approaching. Here is my prophecy, young one. Everything I say now shall soon come to pass. When the wars of the elder races begin to come to fruition, the gods shall take notice and plan for their coming into the world. Then, on the third day of the third season, in the dark of the night on all the continents of the elder races, shall be reborn my chosen in the bodies of other men, representing all of the three virtues: good, evil, and the gray neutral between them both. They will arise to the call of a fourth chosen, great among them, who will collect my gifts unto himself: the magic enhancements of Miragul, the flaming sword of Nalikor, and your dragon pendant. The peoples of Norrath will revere this one as Trakanon's chosen, and he will watch the whole world burn.&quot; <br>
<br>
Of Edril's last days: <br>
<br>
When he returned home he was changed forever. With his greatest achievment completed, Edril the warrior, feared of the orcan clans, slayer of the plague dragon of Akanon, first soldier of the empire, and desert wanderer of Norrath, hung his sword to rest forever. He lived many happy years in the arms of Almaril, his wife, and they even gave birth to a son, something no one thought possible between a erudite and elf. But whether it was fate's choice to test Edril one last time or because erudites were enough &quot;non-human&quot; so procreation was near impossible, Edril's son was taken by disease at an early age. The event crushed the indomitable elf and at the age of 405 the warrior passed away. &quot;No spear or sword or arrow, fang, claw, or spell could ever hope of killing the elf known as Edril,&quot; recounted Biddyn at the funeral of his friend, &quot;but for a father, the death of an only child is the worst poison the world can give.&quot; The lord of Qeynos thought it best to send his body back to the elven empire and there gathered a very ecclectic funeral procession: Merchant friends from Freeport and Qeynos, human lords of Antonica, almost the entire gnomish population, and even troll shamans from Grobb to bear witness to the last warrior to ever lay eyes on Trakanon. Some said the dark elves were also present, spying on the funeral from the shadows just to make sure Edril had actually lost the battle with death. Dozens of elven trumpets sounded his passing and his casket was floated over the top of the Elizerain Lake to sink into it's depths forever, an honor normally reserved only for the emperors. It is written that even now, at the bottom of the lake in that same casket, the dragon pendant of Trakanon waits, grasped tightly in Edril's cold, dead fingers. <br>
<br>
Of the ancient trolls and the dragon Trakanon: <br>
<br>
The present day kingdom of Grobb has always been fairly secretive about it's heritage, but common trollish lore tells us that the kingdom has it's roots in the blasted continent of Kunark, a land of venomous rivers, gray wastes, and seething deadwood forests. It is written that here, nestled on the banks of the Murkdweller river, Innoruk chose to taint the bodies of man with cruel magics in his attempt at further having a hold on the prophecied surge of human power in the third age. But with the advent of the war of the broken crown, sages tell that Innoruk eventually forgot about his trollish abominations and left them to die on Kunark. What followed for the trolls was decades of brutal combat as they struggled for the scarce natural resources of their dead continent. <br>
<br>
It was at this time that the ancient dragon Trakanon took notice of the slowly dying race. To call the ancient one a dragon is purely speculative, as no one has ever seen the terrible beast many think is reponsible for the present condition of Kunark, but the garbled texts of the trolls describe him as one. The dragon is said to have gathered the entire population of Kunark onto one island in the broken teeth chain and there offer the trolls a pact: Trakanon would supply the forgotten children of Innoruk with food and water from his personal jungle lands if they would become his servants. The trolls agreed, regarding Trakanon as a powerful savior, king, and god. Trakanon organized the trolls into separate tribes each to occupy a certain part of eastern Kunark so he could control them better. It was at this time his servants adopted the name &quot;troll&quot; which is a shortened form of the phrase &quot;troll quel'dom gik Trakanon&quot; which meant &quot;the green children of Trakanon&quot; in dragonish. <br>
<br>
Of Trakanon's seclusion and the wars of the seven tribes: <br>
<br>
It has never been in the power of either man or troll to determine the great dragon's reason for his abandonement, but we can't hope to understand the ways of the immortals. Every text simply states that Trakanon may have just changed his mind. Nevertheless, after centuries of relative peace and harsh rule under their godlike king, the twenty-five tribes of Trakanon entered the second age with their food supply dwindling and shipments coming in less and less frequently. At first there was no panic, the tribal leaders sent messengers to their king to ask forgiveness for whatever they had done wrong, but the messengers started to come back with word that they had been denied an audience with the great dragon. Trollish caravans by the hundreds started to crowd the dark hills of disdain, waiting for the gates to open into Trakanon's hidden kingdom, but that day never came. When word of Trakanon's seclusion started spreading throughout Kunark, each tribe began to move closer and closer to the east where food had once come through. They arrived next to Trakanon's kingdom only to learn that the great dragon king had not been seen for more then 50 years and just recently had closed his gates to all messengers and caravans. The trolls were confused, distraught, and starving, and so they waited in the Kunark east for some word to come from their god. <br>
<br>
When that word never came, the tribes of Trakanon started to grow restless. Battles started to erupt haphazardly and tribal villages were attacked and plundered. In the shadows of the mountain range &quot;Trakanon's teeth&quot; a new trollish war erupted. The 25 tribes of Trakanon attacked eachother viciously for food and water, and for ten years they battled nonstop until only 7 tribes were left. These 7 tribes retreated to every corner around what is now called the field of bone, named for the countless trollish skeletons which cover the ground. For centuries more the surviving trolls would fight what has been called the war of the seven tribes in their attempts at stealing whatever they could for food and drink, even the flesh and blood of other tribal members. Trollish shamans say that every day while the war raged beneath him, Trakanon sat perched high above his jungle throne, watching his trolls die with a grin on his face. The war would almost cause the complete destruction of the troll race. <br>
<br>
The Troll Migration <br>
<br>
Of Chief Nalikor and the end of the tribal wars: <br>
<br>
In the middle of the third age, the tribes of Trakanon were all but completely destroyed. The wars had continued for a century or more and when the seven tribes began to finally die out, mostly from starvation and disease, the trolls moved completely to the north of the field of bone and away from the swamp of no hope, the spot of their creation, forever. There the starving tribe of chief Kateera and the desperate followers of chief Nalikor squared off in one final confrontation. Across the northern shores of Kunark raged a battle so terrible elven bards dare sing of it only in the dark hours of the night. Troll was pitted against troll in the end of a war that would prove what tribe would rule Kunark, and each tribe fought with the single goal of completely destroying the other. Slowly, the two tribes began to die. Trolls began to consume the flesh of slain enemies, as was the accepted custom of the tribe wars, but also the flesh of fallen comrades. In fits of madness, trollish warriors would attack their own tribesmen and then commit suicide. The fights degenerated into scenes of utter insanity as trollish warriors started attacking anyone around them, friend or foe, to eat whatever they killed and to steal whatever they could grab. <br>
<br>
The two most unaffected by the insanity around them, being veterans of the tribe wars themselves, were the two chiefs: Kateera and Nalikor. Realizing that the battle they had begun would be the beginning of the end of the troll race, both leaders met face to face with a host of their most trusted warriors on what is named Nalikor's Mound by the ancient trollish texts with the simple intent of ending the war once and for all. Every text says Kateera was the one who issued the challenge, and some troll shamans describe Kateera as a foolish, rash young leader who could have never stood a chance against the older Nalikor. Others, however, say that Nalikor and Kateera entered in on an understanding that in order for the trolls to stop the war the young leader had to die. Either way, while the rest of the trollish camps settled down from the war if only for a brief rest under a new moon, the young chief Kateera was run through and beheaded by the old Nalikor. Rather then carry out trollish customs and consume the bodies of his enemies, Nalikor only took Kateera's head as proof of his victory, then buried the young chief and his fallen guards on top of the highest hill in the field of bone, the one most stained with blood. Here the old chief stacked the weapons of warriors that had been dead for centuries and the place was called Nalikor's Mound, a monument to the old tribes of Trakanon and the mark of a new age for the troll race. No one has reportedly seen the mound, but the texts speak of it as a horrible site: a small red mountain with spears and swords thrust through it, surrounded on all sides by the endless troll-skeletons which cover the field of bone. At it's top Nalikor set Kateera's severed head, grinning as it hung from a metal pike. <br>
<br>
Of Trakanon's chosen and the fleet of bone: <br>
<br>
The tribe of the now defeated Kateera surprisingly did not put up much of a resistance when they were told about the death of their leader and their loss in the war. For a week, the survivors of both tribes rejoiced in the end of centuries of warfare, feasting and dancing over the corpses of the dead, but many questions still remained unanswered and many problems were left unsolved. For decades troll shamans had prophecied that the tribe to win the wars would be given unimaginable riches and power by their dragon lord, but Trakanon never revealed himself to the last tribe even after the war was over. Kunark was now completely a blasted land and a graveyard. All the creatures were dead and the undrinkable rivers were red with blood. The tribe of Nalikor thought themselves the sole rulers of their continent, but their continent was left with nothing they could use to survive. When tensions started to rise again among members of the same tribe, Nalikor realized that his followers were ready once more to destroy themselves. Powerless and desperate, the old chief then decided to commit an act of trollish blasphemy: he would cross Trakanon's Teeth, steal his way into the jungle kingdom of the great dragon, and speak to the king of the trolls personally. <br>
<br>
Many different stories are written about the month-long journey of Nalikor into the forbidden territory of his once-god Trakanon, but all have these few things in common: It is said that the old chief did actually meet the great dragon and that he told Trakanon all but one of the tribes had been killed. The ancient beast obviously admired the chief, as he awarded Nalikor with a magic blade and a key into his eternal kingdom, but the dragon also told Nalikor bluntly that he would give no aid to the trolls. It was then that Trakanon told Nalikor of the other continents and the other races, and that the chief could either lead his people away from Kunark or watch the last tribe die. Nalikor was especially outraged at the mention of more fruitful continents and the elder races, and it is speculated that the hostility trolls have towards all other Norrathians is spawned from this scorned jealousy, like a grown man emerging from a troubled childhood. When Nalikor returned to his tribe he found it in chaos, split among five different leaders each with different plans for Kunark. The old chief killed each would-be-leader quickly, his flaming sword easily cutting them down, and when word of Nalikor's new-found power spread the trolls once more united behind him and gave him the title &quot;Trakanon's chosen.&quot; <br>
<br>
The old chief told all four hundred of his remaining followers what Trakanon had told him, and quickly began to lay out the plan for an escape off their island-continent. With a very limited supply of natural resources, Nalikor and his men built a fleet of five massive ships entirely out of wood, steel, and the bones of dead trolls. With nothing left on Kunark, the trolls gladly boarded the fleet of bone, leaving behind them their entire culture of war and death, and sailed aimlessly for many weeks until coming to the broken skull rock off Antonica, in the middle of the gulf of Gunthak. <br>
<br>
Of the Ogre attacks and the treaty of the burning blade: <br>
<br>
Even before they had landed, the ogres of Oggok knew of the formidable and ivory ships sailing for their borders. Thinking they had something to fear from the mysterious troll fleet, which was landing next to the weakest part in the natural defense of Oggok, the ogres immediately gathered a large force of warriors to stop the trolls from advancing. To their complete surprise, the ogres found the strange trolls to almost be their exact equals in combat and the warriors were turned back by the massive tribe of Nalikor. Over the next few days, the ogres would continue their attacks on Nalikor's tribe. The fierce troll warriors, still homeless and starving, were able to fight off the ogres many more times but were only barely keeping Oggok at bay. The Greenblood river is named for the many trolls who died in it's waters as a result of ogre raids. Nalikor, not fully understanding the ogre race or these recent skurmishes, sent word of a treaty to Oggok. To the surprise of all the other races, king Gharn, the eighth warlord of the ogres, whole-heartedly agreed. <br>
<br>
The ogres and trolls shared a mutual respect, as much a respect as members of those two races can possibly produce. The ogres saw the trolls as merciless warriors with strange powers, but with a harsh and warlike attitude the ogres found pleasing. The trolls, also, respected the strength and kill-or-be-killed ways of the ogre kingdom. Soon the two races found themselves fast allies. On the very place where Nalikor and his followers first landed, broken skull rock, the ogres and trolls signed an agreement that neither force would attack the other. Instead, the ogres would help the trolls establish a kingdom and routes of supplies on Antonica in exchange for troll military support and magical aid. To seal the kinship between ogre and troll, Nalikor gave his own magical blade as part of the arrangement. The sword is still kept on broken skull rock in that same secret meeting place, encased in a magical field of crystal. On it's surface is etched &quot;Here the great alliance was formed between king Gharn the slayer and Trakanon's chosen. May death come to those who seek to disrupt it.&quot; Thus the alliance was called the treaty of the burning blade. <br>
<br>
With the aid of the ogres, out of the ashes of the last tribe of Trakanon sprang forth a new kingdom for the trolls. Nalikor chose the edges of the Innothule Swamp for the trolls to live, which most closely resembled the place of their creation: the swamp of no hope on Kunark. The ogres taught the trolls how to hunt in their new land and how to build fortifications. Nalikor himself was deeply involved in creating the new hierarchy of the troll kingdom and ending the old tribal system of Trakanon, but he died before he could completely achieve his goal. His death resulted in many days of troll mourning, and the burial site of Trakanon's chosen was made the foundation of the new troll city of Grobb- named for Nalikor's successor and the first official king of the trolls. It is said that somewhere deep inside the temple depths of Grobb the trollish shamans still keep watch over Nalikor's key: the only remaining link between the trolls and the ancient kingdom of the dragon Trakanon. <br>
<br>
Taken from the official site: <br>
<br>
Over three thousand years in the past humanity was in its infancy. Mankind dwelled in the center of Antonica, spreading out slowly to inhabit the vast and fertile plains of  Karana. Villages appeared and prospered, several reaching the size of towns, and two even became cities -- Qeynos to the west, and Freeport to the east. Humanity, much to the disdain of the elder races who watched from afar, was strong -- it rapidly gained a solid foothold in the world of Norrath and was there to stay. <br>
<br>
This is not to imply, however, that humanity was at peace. Early on small groups formed, some linked by similar appearances, others by common goals. Competition was fierce, and when resources grew scarce for one reason or another many groups abandoned the promises and alliances of their past and fought. A few leaders spoke out against the violence, urging the masses to remember why they had fled the cold north. They had broken away from the lands of Halas and their barbarian brothers in the name of peace, and these leaders insisted that humanity adhere once again to those principals to which all had agreed. <br>
<br>
Their cry was not totally ignored, and the fighting subsided. Villages were encouraged  to trade with one another and to respond to competition nonviolently. An economy based largely on agriculture appeared and the villages and small towns were surrounded by large farms. Most of humanity’s leaders were pleased with this, wanting nothing more than peace and food on every man’s table after a hard day of work. A few, however, wanted more. Even though their people had risen well beyond the standard of living endured by their barbarian brothers to the north, they were not   content. Explorers and adventurers returned from afar with tales of elves, dwarves, and other strange creatures, as well as descriptions of ancient abandoned cities. A few even came back with limited knowledge of sorcery and the mystic arts. <br>
<br>
And when that discontent minority of leaders heard all of this, they became both jealous and determined. A small, fragile man of great intellect called Erud led this group, and he formed them into a council. They quickly became irritated, even disgusted, by their fellow man. Leaving a small network of spies behind, the remainder of Erud’s followers fled the city of Qeynos and boarded a small fleet of ships. They sailed to the west and landed upon the barren coast of the island of Odus. The land was sparse and uninhabited and quite appealing to the council and their people. They quickly built a city of their own, dissimilar in almost every way to both Qeynos and Freeport, for it was almost entirely a towering castle. Erudin it was called, and within it the scribes and scholars, who called themselves High Men, gathered and analyzed reports, captured books and scrolls, and other artifacts brought to them by their spies. The first human mages were then born – wizards, sorcerers, and enchanters occupied the great halls of Erudin and grew immensely in both power and knowledge. <br>
<br>
One of the more adept practitioners of the arts was named Miragul. Unlike and more extreme than the others, he not only abhorred his human brothers on the mainland to the east, but he also grew to hate his fellow Erudites. To him they were both short sighted and narrow. They created schools of thought, categorizing magic into three groups and designing themselves to three classes: Wizards, Sorcerers, and Enchanters. Miragul found this limiting and thoroughly resented the thought of being restricted to one school of thought or another. <br>
<br>
He soon found others who felt similarly. They were a small but growing group of outcasts who often studied forbidden texts and other knowledge generally kept secret from the majority of students. The council was morally and ethically    opposed to much of the information gathered afar by their spies. Miragul found that these outcasts not only studied the three schools of magic, but also a fourth. It was called Necromancy and a few lucky spies had returned from a distant underground city (Neriak, it was called, home of the dark elves) with both their lives and also ancient texts describing  this art. Miragul was intrigued, and, by using powerful magic, created for himself four identities, four separate countenances and names, and joined all four schools without the knowledge of the council, nor anyone else for that matter. <br>
<br>
It came to pass some years later that the council, in its ever growing desire to know all there was to know, both in distant lands and also in its own city, discovered the group of Necromancers. They were branded heretics and a great conflict arose. For the first time in several hundred years, the Erudites fought. They engaged in a civil war not entirely dissimilar to that which they had loathed and fled from back on the mainland. But there was one very significant difference – they did not use swords and bows, but rather magic, and the result was terrible. Lives by the hundreds were lost, great buildings and structures destroyed, and eventually the heretics were forced to flee Erudin, to hide and regroup in the southern regions of Odus. <br>
<br>
Miragul, being a member of all four schools, was not blind to the implications when the conflict began. He left the heretics before they fled the city, abandoning his fourth identity and siding apparently with the council. But this was only a ruse in order to buy time. He soon gathered every artifact and tome he could discreetly steal and then left Odus entirely, taking a ship back to Antonica and to the city of Qeynos. The lands of men, however, were not only to his dislike, but also filled with Erudite spies.Miragul grew afraid, even paranoid, and soon fled again. He headed far to the north and then to the east, wishing to avoid the barbarians of Halas. After many weeks he found himself near the great lake called Winter’s Deep and he hid there for some time. <br>
<br>
While Miragul waited in secret his mind was not idle. He schemed and planned, and looked over every letter of every scroll and tome he had taken from Erudin. Time passed and his understanding and power grew. But he was unsatisfied  and a deep hunger for even more arcane knowledge ate away at him. He soon left his hiding place and began to travel long distances in search of more ancient texts and artifacts. His power had grown and confidence overcame his fear of Erudite spies. Once again he cloaked himself in false identity and countenance and traveled the lands of men. <br>
<br>
 Not far to the south of where his cache of artifacts lay, Miragul soon found another of the new races, the Halflings, and their town Rivervale. The mage feared these small people and their propensity to sneak and to steal, and as his treasures grew in both size and value, he eventually made the decision to move even farther north, and away from all intelligent life. He traveled leagues and leagues, far beyond the range of both Erudite spy and curious Halfling, and eventually came to a vast tundra. This land had no name, and was not until centuries later referred to as merely the Frigid Plain. This frosty and remote environment appealed to Miragul’s heart, for it had grown cold, obsessed with only knowledge and the abstract, and filled with only hatred for others. Creatures with intelligence forced him to be discreet and slowed his acquisition of  knowledge and items. He had as little to do with them as he could, only hiding amongst them when absolutely necessary. <br>
<br>
Under the icy ground of the Frigid Plains, Miragul created a large network of tunnels and rooms in which to hide and study his collection. He used no labor, but rather deep magic to remove the earth from his way. Room after room, passage after passage, he did create to house his store of artifacts. He split his years, spending one score out in the world, exploring and amassing knowledge and items, returning them  to his cache, and then the next dabbling with them, experimenting in one of several laboratories he had created. <br>
<br>
Many years passed, even centuries. Miragul grew old, even though he did  his best to extend his life using magical means. There was a limit to his enlightenment when it came to aging, and he soon acknowledged that one day even he would die. Only one aspect of death did he fear, and being no longer able to learn and collect wrought him with terror. As his skin grew wrinkled, and his breath short, Miragul’s time was spent less exploring the world of Norrath and more studying the existential. He soon discovered the various hidden dimensions that neighbored his own, the Planes of Power and Discord. He discovered means by which he could traverse these planes, making portals that led between them. But his strength was leaving him, and his  journeys into these realities were short and often unprofitable. More and more, his own mortality limited his reason for living, and the specter of death haunted him daily. <br>
<br>
The mage’s research into life and death was built upon a foundation he had learned from his fellow outcasts centuries before in Erudin. Necromancy, more than any other art, became Miragul’s obsession. Eventually he discovered a means by which to create portals within his own plane and made them to travel great distances in mere seconds. He traveled back to Odus, to its southern regions, in search of the other Necromancers. Perhaps, he mused, they had unearthed by now a way to cheat death. <br>
<br>
The mage soon found that the heretics of Erudin had built a city into a  great hole that led to unknown depths beneath the earth. This chasm was apparently the result of that huge civil war from which Miragul had fled centuries earlier. The city, called Paineel, though somewhat suspicious, allowed Miragul to enter and after a time he earned its inhabitant’s trust. Many humored the old man and his claims, while a select few respected him and were willing to trade knowledge for knowledge, power for power. They revealed to him the true power of necromancy, the ability to raise the dead, creating zombies and wraiths obedient in every way to their master. Many of the heretics planned to assault Erudin with vast armies of undead, to wreak revenge upon the council that had exiled and made war upon them in centuries past. <br>
<br>
One important aspect of their necromancy interested Miragul, the fact that the undead ceased to age. Their lives appeared endless and the elderly mage knew that he must discover a way to be like them. He feigned interest in the heretic’s goals, learning spells to raise the dead, helping them raise their undead army. All the while, however, he was  experimenting himself, hiding much of his research in the small home he was given in Paineel. After some time he discovered that which he had sought, a way to transform a living being, as opposed to a corpse, into the undead. Unfortunately, time was scarce, for he was tired and almost dead himself, his body deteriorating with age, and the heretics were almost ready to make war once again. <br>
<br>
Miragul then left Paineel, using a small portion of his dwindling life energies to make a portal back to his cache hundreds of leagues to the north. Upon arrival, he withdrew silently to his most secret laboratory and prepared his final spell. Dreaming all the while of endless exploration and discovery, he slowly made ready his ultimate experiment. The enchantment laced with necromancy was finally made, and Miragul hid  his remaining and fragile life within the phylactery, a small device he had pilfered from the other necromancers. Clouds of mystical energy gathered and then dispersed, revealing a shell of the man Miragul once was, an undead mage, what ancient scripts and legends called a lich. <br>
<br>
In his haste, however, Miragul had made a miscalculation. The lich, while retaining all the mystical power of his formal self, lacked a spirit. Only the mage’s soul, now locked within the phylactery hidden deep in the cache, retained the ambition and desire to amass knowledge and power. The spiritless lich possessed none of these human traits, and Miragul’s soul screamed in silence as the undead creature began to aimlessly wander his menagerie of wisdom and enlightenment, his rooms filled with artifacts of power. <br>

<br>
This happened tonight, September 4th 2000 at 11:00 PST.  I was playing a lower level character of mine named Wump and was wandering aimlessly, eventually ending up at the front of Felwithe.  People were sitting around talking when suddenly two GM's appeared.  They said &quot;come in for a tale&quot; and walked into Felwithe.  Apparently they didnt want many because only 10 or so were there at the time and they stayed mere seconds, so a select crowd got to go with them and it was keept a small event the whole time.  We walked into Felwithe (all the players on walk) and eventually entered a tavern. Rahgoths asked us if we would like to hear a tale, and told us that no items were going to be rewarded, and that no quest lead from this...it was simply a tale of old.  Everyone quickly agreed and found their seats, many got drunk.  I had the good mind to turn on eq.log and captured everything he said from begining to end.  I edited the log to remove all the worthless spam and castings and such that were there.  Heres what was said that night, preceeded by a list of those in attandence.   <br>

Alain says, 'Ah, so hes a person' <br>
You say, 'Al'kabor is a Gnome Wizard, he founded many of the spells we still use today' <br>

Alain says, 'What about this shipwreck?' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Ah yes...' <br>
Khaled says, 'Indeed' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'the tale...' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Al'kabor learned of some great shipwreck in the Ocean of Tears' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'But, he also learned by way of a messanger that there was something special in the cargo hold of this ship.' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'So, that bright sunny morning Al`kabor went to his storage chest and gathered his robe, staff, spellbook, and a few other wizard items' <br>
Woodsmoke says, 'is the water in odus salty?' <br>
Woodsmoke says, 'i have never tasted it' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Woodsmoke, not quite as bad as the Ocean of Tears' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Anyway..' <br>
Alain says, 'What did Al'kabor do next?' <br>
Europe says, 'go on rahgoths' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Al'kabor learned from the messanger that there was a survivor of this shipwreck.' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'The survivor's name was Tillerman Janck.' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'There was only one problem...' <br>
Alain says, 'What was the problem?' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Al`kabor only heard rumors of where he may now be, so he knew he would need help finding Tillerman, for he was the only one who knew exactly where this wreckage was' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Ah...Woodsmoke that part is yet to come.' <br>
Alain says, 'What kind of help could he get to find this Tillerman?' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Al`kabor decided that he would find aid in the great city of Qeynos.' <br>
Alain says, 'Qeynos is quite a way away from the OOT.  Why did he go there?' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Alain, he needed to hire help' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Ah...there is more friends' <br>
Alain says, 'What kind of help did he find in Qeynos?' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Well,' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'When Al`kabor arrived to the great city of Qeynos...rumor has it the old powerful wizard's voice boomed through the halls of the great stone city of Qeynos as he called for the help of six brave ones' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Brave ones...just like many of you' <br>
Alain says, 'And did 6 brave ones respond to his request for help?' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Al`kabor mentioned that he needed help of at least a ranger and an enchantress' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Aye...after some time....six brave ones did agree to help Al`kabor.' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'They were not quite sure why, but when Al`kabor calls upon people, many do try ot aid' <br>
Alain says, 'Did he threaten them?  Or the city of Qeynos?' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Al`kabor explained that the six brave ones could have whatever was on this wreckage, except for one item which Al`kabor would not name, which he badly wanted.' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Well Alain, Al`kabor calls upon people as 'minons' to put it mildly, very to the point he is' <br>
Starky says, 'Ah so he had another motive besides to save Tillerman' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'continuing...' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Al`kabor did explain that he learned that this Tillerman was rumored to be somewhere in the Commons.' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Have you all seen the great Grasslands of the Commons?' <br>
Woodsmoke says, 'AYE' <br>
You say, 'Aye' <br>
Alain says, 'Oh yes.' <br>
Khaled says, 'I've been to commons' <br>
Freybawe says, 'Aye' <br>
Europe says, 'yes sir, many a time' <br>
Starky says, 'err sorry the liquor must be gettingto my head' <br>
Alain nods. <br>
Khaled says, 'druids killed me there, you might of seen my blood spilt on the grass' <br>
Rahgoths smiles. <br>
Ghann smiles. <br>
Pragma smiles. <br>
Rahgoths says, 'So, where we again friends...' <br>
Woodsmoke says, 'He rumered to be in the commans' <br>
Europe says, 'about the grasslands of commons' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Ah yes...thank you' <br>
Alain says, 'Al'kabor gathered the 6 heros.' <br>
Alain says, 'And was going to take them to the Commonlands.' <br>
Alain says, 'To find Tillerman.' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Thank you Alain...' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'So, they all set out...just as it began to rain...on the path to the Commonlands' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'They as in the six brave ones, and Al`kabor' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Upon arriving at the Commons...' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'The ranger did begin to use his skills in the ways of tracking.' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Anyone here a ranger?' <br>
Starky looks at Rahgoths and raises his hand. <br>
Rahgoths beams a smile at Starky. <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Starky can relate then.' <br>
Rahgoths smiles. <br>
Starky says, 'Seems im the only here today' <br>
Starky nods at Rahgoths. <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Anyway..' <br>
Alain says, 'Do you know what the Ranger's name was?' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'The ranger did begin to track and find signs of disturbance of leaves and such' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Alain, that part has been lost in the tale...' <br>
Alain says, 'Alas.' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'The ranger did indeed lead them to a man...whom was gathering berries' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Upon hailing him and some introduction.....' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'It was indeed Tillerman Janck' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'The brave ones and Al`kabor explained how they dearly wanted him to lead them to the wreckage' <br>
Woodsmoke says, 'Ooooo' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Tillerman however made it very clear he wanted nothing to do with the Ocean again, as he now feared water, hence his moving  the the Commons' <br>
Alain says, 'Was Tillerman Janck a human?' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Aye Alain' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Well,...acording to my book, but again my book is old.' <br>
Alain says, 'Did he know what the cargo about the ship was?' <br>
Rahgoths smiles. <br>
Rahgoths says, 'That part will come later Alain' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Well, it did take MANY ales to persuade Tillerman to aid them' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'but...alas he did cave in and agree to lead them to the wreckage' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'So, the next day, after some rest' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Tillerman, Al`kabor, and the six brave ones set out for the Ocean of Tears' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'It was a fall day, the leaves brown...the smell of the grasslands...' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Let me ask you all this...have you ever acutally paused to take a look around and be in Norrath? ' <br>
You say, 'Aye' <br>
Khaled says, 'indeed' <br>
Europe says, 'aye' <br>
Woodsmoke says, 'Yes\' <br>
Alain says, 'Sure, Steamfont is a particularly fascinating place.' <br>
Khaled says, 'always good to go back to the caves of akanon and go for a swim in that green water' <br>
Rahgoths smiles. <br>
Rahgoths nods. <br>
Khaled says, 'it keeps my skin soft' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Where were we again?' <br>
You say, 'It was autum, leaves were brown....' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'ah yes' <br>
Alain says, 'Tillerman was leading Al'Kabor and the heros to the OOT.' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'So they all set out...for the Ocean of Tears' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Upon reaching the shorline...' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Tillerman began to tremble with fear...' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'He began to walk backwards slowly...away from the group and shore...' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Indeed it was appearant that panic filled his heart and mind' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Alas the enchanter in the group smiled softly and began to cast some kind of enchnatment.' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Tillerman became calm.' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'The enchanter did again cast another spell upon the party...and Tillerman as well.' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'They no longer fealt the need to breathe air like mortals' <br>
Khaled says, 'what shoreline were they at?' <br>
Khaled says, 'sister isle? freeport?' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Khaled, the Ocean of Tears, somewhere near Freeport's edge' <br>
Khaled says, 'i see.. I see....' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'The enchantress began to cast this enchantment upon Al`kabor as well..' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'but he smiled bitterly soft, calmly interupted the enchantress and taped to his earing.' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'He said &quot;No need, I have my powers with this&quot;' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Some say such an item exists in this land still....alas I do not know what it could be' <br>
Rahgoths smiles. <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Anyway..' <br>
Khaled says, 'i've heard of such an item' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Tillerman began to wade into the water...' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'leading the six brave ones and Al`kabor...' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Down deep...deep into the murky waters ....' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Then something began to appear...from the depths...' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'It was a hull...or what was left of it....' <br>
Alain says, 'Was it Tillerman's ship?' <br>
Rahgoths nods. <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Then something else happened.....' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'The waters began to swirl violently around them,....' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Something was not right....' <br>
Woodsmoke says, 'uhoh' <br>
Freybawe says, 'Not kood' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Then it happened all to fast...' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'The truth from the wreckage long ago began to unfold to rapidly...' <br>
Alain says, 'Sirens?  Zombie sailors?' <br>
Alain says, 'Killer sharks?' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'You see friends, twas not storm nor rock nor pirate that caused the wreck that day....' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'No...worse' <br>
Alain says, 'Worse?' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'An ancient evil water elemental' <br>
Freybawe says, 'Lol' <br>
Freybawe says, 'Aek' <br>
[Woodsmoke says, 'AHHHHHHH' <br>
Alain says, 'Yes, that would be worse.' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'It was there to guard its claim form long ago' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'You see, it must have been the case where Tillerman was knocked from the boat and knocked out cold into the water' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'The God's did watch over him that day...' <br>
Europe salutes the gods in pure admiration. <br>
Rahgoths says, 'He floated to shore and there the Sisters did take him in' <br>
Woodsmoke says, 'kind sisters =)' <br>
Freybawe says, 'Aye' <br>
Khaled says, 'I feel bad for killing them now...' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'So there they were...' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'The ancient elemental ranged fortha great wave of attack on Al`kabor, Tillerman, and the heroes' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'A great battle, of what some say was epic broke out...' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Al`kabor and the heroes...casting, fighting, and healing...side by side...' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Much like many of you have proven well in battle' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Then the waters calmed.......' <br>
Rahgoths says, '.....' <br>
Rahgoths says, '....' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Alas it was over....' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'The heroes and Al`kabor had WON!' <br>
Alain cheers. <br>
Woodsmoke says, 'how wuld they be able to see the elemental if it was made of water' <br>
Wotash says, 'YEAH!!' <br>
Europe salutes the gods in pure admiration. <br>
You cheer. <br>
Starky beams a smile at Rahgoths. <br>
Alain says, 'Huzzah!!' <br>
Woodsmoke says, 'WOOT' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Ah yes...' <br>
Khaled says, '.. /cheer' <br>
Woodsmoke says, 'Marvalous' <br>
Europe cheers. <br>
Freybawe CHEERS. <br>
Rahgoths says, 'The ancient elemental shimmered with magics...thus allowing people to see it' <br>
Woodsmoke says, 'ahhhhh' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'continue....' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Al`kabor immediatly went to search the hull of the wreckage...' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Then he produced something......' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'A parchment...' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'A simple parchment friends...' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Then Al`kabor slightly trembled..something rare for such a man of his power....' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'He muttered &quot;The Kedge...it is true....The Kedge...&quot;' <br>
Wotash says, 'huh?' <br>
Alain says, 'The Kedge?' <br>
Woodsmoke says, 'like the robe of the kedge?' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'He hastily stuffed the parchment into a pocket of his robe...' <br>
Khaled says, 'it ws a parchment' <br>
Wotash says, 'Would it get wet?' <br>
Alain says, 'Magical parchment.' <br>
Wotash says, 'ahh. I see' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'He then noted a wooden chest in the corner' <br>
You say, 'The Kedge are an ancient race of Gigantic Squidlike beings....they went out of existance long ago save one who is roumered to still live in the keep to this day' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Wump is 100 percent correct' <br>
Khaled claps happily for Wump - hurray! <br>
You nod. <br>
Woodsmoke applauds wump. <br>
Alain agrees with Wump. <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Alas the wood chest was brought to the heroes...' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'They swam back to shore...Tillerman shivering and a bit grumpy behind them' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'The warrior of the six brave ones brought his sword down upon the wooden chest....' <br>
Alain says, 'Warriors will do that.' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'In it there was numerous gems, fine weapons, and magic scrolls' <br>
Vigor says, 'warriors will hit anything wether its dead or alive' <br>
Vigor says, 'they are stupid like that' <br>
Freybawe says, 'Lol' <br>
Qaru bares her teeth in a terrible snarl. <br>
Freybawe says, ') ' <br>
Woodsmoke hits vigor with his sword. <br>
Rahgoths says, 'With that...' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Al`kabor hastily thanked the brave ones, and TIllerman...as he casted a gate spell...' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Tis unknown where Al`kabor went to for the rest of that day.' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'But that ended his journy for the day....' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'And so ends my tale.' <br>
Freybawe cheers at Rahgoths. <br>
Woodsmoke says, 'BAH' <br>
Rahgoths bows. <br>
Wotash gives a round of applause. <br>
Khaled claps happily for Rahgoths - hurray! <br>

Pragma cheers at Rahgoths. <br>
Freybawe claps happily for Rahgoths - hurray! <br>
Pragma cheers at Rahgoths. <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Woodsmoke...that is a good question.' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'What do you think happened?' <br>
Wotash says, 'Are there any rumors of where he went??' <br>
Woodsmoke says, 'and what did he mean by the kedge is true' <br>
Rahgoths smiles. <br>
Rahgoths says, 'All very good questions...' <br>
Wotash says, 'but alas. no answers right?' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Alas that has been lost over time' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Well,' <br>
Khaled says, 'does tillurman still live today?' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Khaled, perhaps so.' <br>
Khaled says, 'interesting' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Again...there are many things in this land...yet there is something so many of you forget' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Here is the 'catach'' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'er catch' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Tis also ALL OF YOUR jobs to keep the stories and adventure alive....' <br>
Starky applauds Rahgoths's performance. <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Now, I want to thank ALL of you for your time' <br>
Freybawe says, 'Well my friends this has been a VERY fun evening hasnt it?' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'BUT!!!!!' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'I only have one more small request of all of your time' <br>
Europe snaps to attention and salutes Rahgoths crisply. <br>
Wotash says, 'Yes...' <br>
Mellyn listens. <br>
You say, 'Ask and yee shall recieve Rahgoths' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'May I have about 3 minutes uninterupted?' <br>
Europe says, 'yes' <br>
Woodsmoke says, 'yes sorry' <br>
Starky says, 'of course' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'I can show you all riched of Norrath you have never seen' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'er riches rather' <br>

You say, 'Very much so ' <br>
Starky nods at Rahgoths. <br>
Europe says, 'yes' <br>
Freybawe says, 'AYE' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Look' <br>
Rahgoths wipes away a tear from his eye. <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Look...' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'A tavern unused for ages' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Look at the dust on the counters' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Look around...' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Look at these bottles...' <br>
Alain says, 'Many seem rather ancient.' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Now either you will stay with me at this point and 'come into Norrath...or you will not make any sense of this'' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'There is more' <br>
===&lt;walks out of Tavern and over to pond by Felwithe zone&gt;=== <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Tell me...' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Look upon this pond...' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'When is the last time you took a friend here and pondered the ways of your existance and friendship, while simply fishing for the day?' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'When is the last time you had a festival or gathering?' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'The point is, there has been so much here all along...' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Simple things basically ran bay and overlooked ' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'er by (sorry)' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Well, that's all I have for you all.' <br>
Woodsmoke says, 'i will spread this word across the land' <br>
Mellyn takes notes and plans a party. <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Perhaps I just might...just might have...for that one small second...shown or re-opened your eyes to what EQ can be' <br>
It begins to rain. <br>
Guppee says, 'Yu du gud elfie.  Tell gud stories' <br>
Rahgoths puts his book away. <br>
Wotash says, 'GOOD GOOD STORY' <br>
Freybawe cheers at Rahgoths. <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Well.  I am off.' <br>
Freybawe says, 'Quite' <br>
You say, 'I enjoyed the story Rahgoths' <br>
Freybawe waves goodbye to Rahgoths. <br>
You say, 'thank you for coming' <br>
You thank Rahgoths heartily. <br>
Freybawe says, 'Goodbye ' <br>
Mellyn says, 'aye thanks' <br>
Wotash says, 'Lets do this again' <br>
Freybawe thanks Rahgoths heartily. <br>
Woodsmoke says, 'thanks' <br>
Wotash says, 'sometime' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Thanks again.  Perhaps we should do this again' <br>
Starky says, 'May Tunare watch over you Rahgoths' <br>
Rahgoths says, 'Maybe you all will have a tale of your own sometime to tell ME and the others next time at the tavern' <br>
Rahgoths waves goodbye to everyone. <br>
Mellyn waves goodbye to Rahgoths. <br>
Wump waves goodbye to Rahgoths. <br>
===&lt;Rahgoths Explodes...no better way to put that&gt;=== <br>
Freybawe says, 'HOLT CRAP' <br>
Mellyn says, 'heh. they love that' <br>
Starky says, 'lol' <br>
You say, 'Quite an exit <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ' <br>
Freybawe says, 'GOOD GOD' <br>
Wotash says, 'WOW' <br>
Freybawe says, 'that was AMAZING' <br>
Mellyn says, 'that looks like it's gonna leave a mark' <br>
Vigor says, 'blinks twice?' <br>
Woodsmoke wet his pants at the display. <br>
You say, 'Farewell all'   <br>
And that was it.  The group dispensed, many of us stayed around the pond and went fishing, others told stories...a few more went out to Faydark to relay the tale.  As far as I can tell, this is the begining to the finding of the Kedge race, who must have been more ancient than Al'kabor, and probably the begining to their ultimate downfall. Hopefully I'll find more of this story someday <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Until then!

I can verify that the event will prolly happen tonight! <br>
We are one of the last, 8, i think, servers that haven't had it yet. So pls pls PLS be in OT/SF tonight, we request your presence, more now than EVER.<br>
Lany's kills anyone who speaks against her in this event, yet no one has gotten close enough to see if she is attackable. I suggest a strike, even if she does kill us all. Hey, we dont loose exp so all is fine hehe. Maybe just casters? Seen as meeler's will have difficulty getting back.<br>
I for one..will use every single spell I have against her. Perhaps we are not meant to swade the direction of the outcome of this event, but i'm sure as hell not gonna stand there while Lany's gets the second piece, inevitable or not.<br>
Stand with me now..it is now we need to strike.<br>

Another 8hrs today in SF, sitting in the entrance from OT. Yet still no sign of Lany's. I wish someone would take over the watch, or at least keep me company.<br>
Anyways.. a little insight i had while talking to someone about Trakanon today.<br>
Didnt he say that the fourth champion will inherit the gifts of the other 3, and thus trak will die and then the end of days will be brought about etc. Or something to that relevence.<br>
Well.. what if Lany's is the fourth champion?<br>
What if she kills trak and claims the gifts for herself. With the staff by her side, nothing can stop her. What a perfect way to destroy norrath. However, my theoery is highly flawed due to the fact that VI are bringing out a new expansion.. so the death of Norrath seems to be far off the list Lol<br>
Oh well.<br>

Sound screws up, screen gets choppy and 5 secs later I am frozen and I have to coldboot the comp..<br>

I tend to call them fairy dragons, sorry for the confusion. This one was named however and I didn't see it before yet. However chances are good that it was there already. I don't know the zone that well. <br>
Anyway, on another subject, I’ve been investigating Qeynos and specifically the npc in charge of finding the Bloodsabers (The one the newspapers told about.) This is the result of my investigations:<br>
<br>
I started out in the temple of life where I had a talk with an npc called Velarte Selire.<br>
<br>
[Thu Jul 12 03:29:46 2001] Velarte Selire says 'Hello Tyleet . Antonius Bayle and the council have ordered a full investigation of these folks that call themselves the Bloodsabers. I hear his plan is to eventually round up every member of this strange disease worshipping cult and bring them in to answer for their terrible crimes against our city and people. [Vegalys] Keldrane is heading up the investigation. <br>
[Thu Jul 12 03:29:55 2001] You say, 'who is Vegalys?'<br>
[Thu Jul 12 03:29:55 2001] Velarte Selire says 'Vegalys Keldrane is the Lord Magistrate and advisor to Antonius Bayle the Fourth. I hear that he is currently looking for help with these investigations. Perhaps you should talk to him if you are interested in helping him apprehend these criminals. <br>
<br>
At this point I went to find Vegalys Keldrane. I found him in the guardhouse near the Qeynos city gates. Here’s what he has to say:<br>

[Thu Jul 12 03:34:38 2001] Vegalys Keldrane says 'Greetings to you, citizen. By order of the Council of Qeynos I have been given the duty of apprehending the individuals [responsible] for unleashing this terrible plague upon the people and the lands of Antonius Bayle. The more I look into this matter, the more I come to find that this will be no easy task. <br>
[Thu Jul 12 03:34:47 2001] You say, 'Who are responsible?'<br>
[Thu Jul 12 03:34:47 2001] Vegalys Keldrane says 'The plague unleashed upon the Plains of Karana is the work of the followers of Bertoxxulous. Those responsible belong to group known as the Bloodsabers though there were others involved as well. Some time back, they launched a plot to overthrow Antonius Bayle and our ruling council. Their [plan] failed. <br>
[Thu Jul 12 03:35:04 2001] You say, 'What was their plan?'<br>
[Thu Jul 12 03:35:04 2001] Vegalys Keldrane says 'Their plan was to unleash a plague so deadly and virulent that it would wipe out all life from here to Highpass Hold. They planned to brand themselves and their foul allies with a rune that would have rendered them immune to the effects of this plague. From that point they would have been able to simply walk in, easily defeat the weakened stragglers and declare themselves the rulers of this kingdom by default. But they were [careless]. <br>
[Thu Jul 12 03:35:23 2001] You say, 'How were they careless?'<br>
[Thu Jul 12 03:35:24 2001] Vegalys Keldrane says 'The sudden influx of scoundrels and loathsome individuals was our first tip off. They required a rather enormous number of supplies, materials and manpower to construct the ornate altars, craft and enchant their runed branding irons and supply their armies with the weapons needed for the cleanup work afterward. They needed to rely upon [outside help]. <br>
[Thu Jul 12 03:35:45 2001] You say, 'What outside help?'<br>
[Thu Jul 12 03:35:45 2001] Vegalys Keldrane says 'They mostly chose to hire bandits and brigands who are foolishly more concerned with immediate profits than the long-term effects of their actions. But once they knew we were on to them they even started hiring some of the more 'civil' gnolls, if there is such a thing. Gnolls tend to be easy to push around, stupid, and they work very cheaply. They knew their time was short and they were desperate. Choosing to work with untrustworthy, lazy scoundrels caused the whole thing to begin to [unravel], praise Rodcet!<br>
[Thu Jul 12 03:36:20 2001] You say, 'How did it unravel?'<br>
[Thu Jul 12 03:36:21 2001] Vegalys Keldrane says 'Their workers were careless. Aside from noticing the unsavory element in our city, our citizens began to run across many of the strange items and materials that were being trafficked into our city en masse. It was at that point that the citizens began to [complain] quite loudly about all of this. <br>
[Thu Jul 12 03:36:42 2001] You say, 'What did they complain about?'<br>
[Thu Jul 12 03:36:42 2001] Vegalys Keldrane says 'Obviously, they questioned the meaning behind these events and rightfully so. They were frightened much as they are now. I admit, I was remiss in my duties for not noticing it sooner. One of the biggest complainers during this time was a man by the name of [Earron Huntlan], proprieter of the famed Lion's Mane tavern. Though he is just a simple merchant, he did us a great service. <br>
Thu Jul 12 03:37:12 2001] You say, 'Who is Earron Huntlan?'<br>
[Thu Jul 12 03:37:12 2001] Vegalys Keldrane says 'Earron is quite a character. He gets all kinds of travelers stopping by his inn for a drink or whatever other business. His patrons started telling stories of being mugged and harassed by these loathsome individuals in the very streets of our fair city. Of course, he was concerned. So he became a kind of advocate for this cause, ringing the [alarm] bell as it were. I admit, at first I did not believe the conspiracy. I simply could not believe it was all happening under our nose. <br>
[Thu Jul 12 03:37:30 2001] You say, 'What alarm?'<br>
[Thu Jul 12 03:37:30 2001] Vegalys Keldrane says 'Well, he succeeded in whipping the populace into a frenzy. He even got the famous wizard Al'Kabor to help him out by determining the nature of the strange items many of our citizens were finding. Getting that man to do anything not directly related to his research is not an easy thing to accomplish either. Needless to say, at that point I saw the truth and the Prime Healer forgive me for not seeing it sooner. Were it not for the investigations and general outcry of [concerned citizens], we might not be standing here talking today.<br>
[Thu Jul 12 03:37:58 2001] You say, 'What concerned citizens?'<br>
[Thu Jul 12 03:37:58 2001] Vegalys Keldrane says 'Yes, it was citizens like you that helped to save Qeynos that day. We uncovered their plot, captured the man who was in charge and put him to death. Of course, the Bloodsabers retaliated and using their incomplete research still managed to unleash the plague we face now. Though devastating in its own right, you must admit it is rather mild compared to what it might have been. I thank you for your interest. Perhaps you would be willing to [help] me? <br>
[Thu Jul 12 03:38:25 2001] You say, 'How can I help?'<br>
[Thu Jul 12 03:38:25 2001] Vegalys Keldrane says 'Excellent! The more I learn from my investigators the more I find that these Bloodsabers have stretched their tendrils of influence all throughout our beloved city. Nevertheless, we are committed to exposing these fiends once and for all. Perhaps you would like to become an [investigator]? <br>
[Thu Jul 12 03:38:52 2001] You say, 'I would like to become an investigator'<br>
[Thu Jul 12 03:38:52 2001] Vegalys Keldrane says 'Very well then, Tyleet . We will not allow just anyone to wear the official Investigator's Badge and please forgive me. . . But it is hard to tell where one's loyalties lie these days. If you are truly [serious] then there is a duty you must perform first to show you are on the side of Antonius Bayle, the council and the good people Qeynos.  <br>
[Thu Jul 12 03:39:07 2001] You say, 'I am serious'<br>
[Thu Jul 12 03:39:07 2001] Vegalys Keldrane says 'There is a guard by the name of Robbie Shilster that patrols the Northern Plains of Karana. He is allied with our enemies and completely corrupt. He is flagrant in his trafficking of contraband goods. His orders are to guard the great wooden bridge to stave off the insect swarms. But our investigators report that he simply stands to the side and watches as the swarm rolls through. You are to execute this man for his treason and bring me his helm. Then, we will talk. <br>
<br>
Off I went to North Karana, to find the guard near the wooden bridge. He was green to a level 35, had a nasty harm touch of about 170 points of damage and necromancer like abilities. He dropped a Cracked corrupted guard helm, Lore – no drop. Gave good faction with the qeynos guards and Antonius Bayle and bad with the corrupted guards/Bloodsabers/Kane bayle, as could be expected. The helmet I brought back to mr Keldrane to result in the following response:<br>
<br>
[Thu Jul 12 03:58:25 2001] Vegalys Keldrane says 'Thank you for bringing this person to justice. Please read this manual very, VERY carefully. Commit it to memory. We do everything strictly by the book. We are a people of law and order and I simply won't tolerate a breach of protocol. Investigators are expected to accurately report findings, are authorized to issue warrants and to notarize official documents for all lands under the jurisdiction of Antonius Bayle and the council. I sincerely hope you can earn your Investigator's Badge. <br>
<br>
He handed me an investigator apprentice briefing which explained the rest of the quest. In short, you’re supposed to find “an investigator” in South Qeynos and hand him the briefing. This investigator follows you around and directs you to three suspected bloodsabers. You have to go find these three and ask them if they are a member of the bloodsabers, then have them sign a confession and arrest them. <br>
<br>
[Thu Jul 12 04:11:35 2001] an investigator says 'Very well, let's get to work. I assume you have read the briefing and committed it to memory. This is how you will be tested. I shall play the part of student and you shall play the master who directs me. I promise I won't make it easy on you either, we want only the best. We'll see how you do and then I'll decide if you are worthy to wear the badge or not. <br>
[Thu Jul 12 04:11:54 2001] You say, 'Where is the first suspect?'<br>
[Thu Jul 12 04:11:55 2001] an investigator says 'The first suspect was last seen near the shop called Fireprides. <br>
[Thu Jul 12 04:12:01 2001] You say, 'Follow me'<br>
[Thu Jul 12 04:12:01 2001] an investigator says 'Following Master.'<br>
[Thu Jul 12 04:13:34 2001] You say, 'Hail, Riley Shplots'<br>
[Thu Jul 12 04:13:43 2001] You say, 'Are you a member of the bloodsabers?'<br>
[Thu Jul 12 04:13:43 2001] Riley Shplots shakes visibly and says, 'Oh, no. I knew this would happen one day. Please don't hurt me! I had very little to do with this plague, though it is quite a nice one, you must admit. I was just a courier. I'll come quietly. I don't want any trouble. My small contribution to the glory of Bertoxxulous has already been given but I certainly don't want to go to meet him just yet!' <br>
[Thu Jul 12 04:14:09 2001] You say, 'Give me a confession document'<br>
[Thu Jul 12 04:14:09 2001] an investigator says 'Here you are. <br>
[Thu Jul 12 04:14:54 2001] You say, 'Summon a guard'<br>
[Thu Jul 12 04:15:00 2001] Guard Sylus says 'Come along, prisoner. <br>
<br>
The guard proceeds to take away Riley Shplots. The same thing happens with the next suspect who is standing below the Qeynos Arena. Except this one doesn’t want to confess. <br>
<br>
[Thu Jul 12 04:17:45 2001] Willie Garrote says 'A Bloodsaber? Of course I'm not, don't be ridiculous! <br>
<br>
I gave him a confession form anyway, and he was taken away by a guard as well.<br>
Onward to the next suspect who was standing next to the docks.<br>
<br>
[Thu Jul 12 04:27:32 2001] Donally Stultz says 'Of course I'm a Bloodsaber, you fool! I've just returned from the Plains of Karana where I was reveling in the glory of the Plaguebringer. Now then, since I see that this foolish investigator is with you, I suppose you want me to sign a confession document or something like that? Well, let's have it then! <br>
[Thu Jul 12 04:27:56 2001] You say, 'Give me an confession document'<br>
[Thu Jul 12 04:27:57 2001] an investigator says 'Here you are.<br>
[Thu Jul 12 04:28:00 2001] Donally Stultz crumples the document into a ball, throws it to the ground and spits in your face, yelling, 'You are a fool if you really believe I would sign such a thing. Prepare to die!'<br>
<br>
Donally starts attacking. He was green to me (at 35), hit rather hard however and still gave experience. After I killed him I handed his head and the two confession signs to the investigator, as instructed.<br>
<br>
[Thu Jul 12 04:28:43 2001] You have slain Donally Stultz!<br>
[Thu Jul 12 04:28:43 2001] You gain experience!!<br>
[Thu Jul 12 04:28:44 2001] Donally Stult says 'You. . . can not. . . defeat us all. . . <br>
[Thu Jul 12 04:28:50 2001] --You have looted a Head of Donally Stultz.--<br>
[Thu Jul 12 04:29:11 2001] an investigator says 'You have done our city a great service and helped to bring several criminals to justice this day! Wear this Investigator's Badge with pride! Speak again with Vegalys Keldrane, he may have information about [advancing further] in rank. <br>
<br>
The result of all this was an investigators badge. Neck item: AC1, +1 str/wis/int/agi and hp/mana +5 usuable by everyone.<br>
<br>
I tried to go back to Vegalys Keldrane, but he gave no new quest. His words however seem to indicate that this quest will be updated sometimes soon.<br>
<br>
[Thu Jul 12 04:34:01 2001] You say, 'What about advancing further?'<br>
[Thu Jul 12 04:34:01 2001] Vegalys Keldrane says 'At this point, I am mainly in need of loyal and trustworthy investigators. I must first gather information on who these people are and exactly how far their influences stretch. However, once I begin to implement the next phase of this operation, you may be able to assist us once again if you prove to be talented enough. For now, simply continue to observe and report. <br>
<br>
Here ends my report. I hope that Qeynos will soon be rid of this plague and the people who created it. <br>
<br>
Keep fighting the good fight and apologies for the huge post,<br>
<br>

I didn't notice at first but when I arrived at the Faery Village I saw Faeries in stead of the undead sprites! I looked up at the sky and it was blue (euhm grey) again. Also the frightlings had changed back to pixies and when I looked for the ranger he was gone also. I walked out of the forest, glad that the corruption had ended, a bit disapointed that I didn't get the oppertunity to get myself an earring.<br>
Same night they announced that like 15 servers where going down, Karana being one of them. Downtime would be about 1 hour.<br>
When I came back to the forest later that day I looked up to the sky again and it had coloured red again. I went straight for the frightling tower and the tiny skeletons were back also. But as I came to the front I got the scare of my life. Cazic Thule was standing on guard right in front of it! Ok uppon closer examination this thing was a great deal smaller then Cazic Thule but I got quite a scare anyway. A Dark Elf shadow knight was also just exploring here. He tried to talk to the creature that called itself The Dread Caller but got no responce. Whenever I came too close he scowled at me ready to attack though so I decided not to try and talk to it also. I would have jumped right in but my experience tells me that things that look that potent (he conned blue to me at 51 and red to the 45 shadow knight so probably was about 50) roll me up to a small ball of blue armor and they go play with me a bit. I tried to get pick away at the frightlings without alarming the new guardian of the tower. This went well for a while but I decided to stay clear for a while and ask the ranger if he might know more about this Dread Caller. I didn't get any awnsers from him but after I returned a druid and a fellow paladin where examining the abomination also. I asked them if they wanted to join forces to try and slay it and so we did. After some preparations we attacked it. tha battle took a long time and if it had not been for the root spell and the druids spells we might not have survived. But in the end we were victorious. The Dread Caller carried on him a small Koada'dall Flesh Idol. A frightning look indeed. The druid had taken the idol and I am not quite sure what he has done with it. We where all unsure what this would be used for. We tried to talk to the ranger some more but again he wouldn't say anything.<br>
Now the tower had been cleared from this threath we continued to eliminate the frightlings from the tower. I eventually got a tiny skull but not before Equestrielle, the corrupted had found us and attacked us (also a blue spawn at 51 mind you). After we dispatched of her we found a horn. Too bad we had no bard to play it. After this I returned the frighlings skull to the ranger and I received my earring. Quite an interesting night for a change in the Lesser Faydark once again.<br>
I haven't been to the forest in a while now. I haven't heard either if it has been restoned once again or anything. I can confirm that Lanys' followers were no longer in the ruins of Befallen when I last visited there. Just the usual skeletons and rats and not a dark elf around every corner like a few days before. I guess they have found what they came for there. I don't know. <br>

She began telling us about the completion of Malevolence and that she needed only one more piece to complete it, Bloodmoon. She informed us that the Bloodmoon was in the possession of Mayoong Mistmoore and he is in hiding to keep the last piece of the staff from finishing the staff. She then led a charge with rougly fifty people in tow and attacked each of the new Teir`dal camps until all of the Dark Elves had been slaughtered. At the final battle at the last camp, the Dark Lady chose a young Dark Elf Shadow Knight, Drusila, to deliver the insignia of the Teir`dal captain to an emmisary that awaited in Nektulos forest.<br>
<br>
Lanys then disappeared and Drusila led the mob of players to the bridge where the emmisary waited. Lanys had warned Drusila of imposters who would attempt to deceive her and take the insignia, but the emmisary, Ashteth T`Dral proved himself true, and then led the remaining onlookers to the Library in Neriak Third Gate where his queen, Christanos Thex held a brief counsel with Drusila and Ashteth T`Dral about Lanys plans. A few minutes past and Lady Thex departed leaving Ashteth and the players at the library entrance. Ashteth T`Dral stayed for about fifteen more minutes an talked about Malevolece's past and what catastrophic events could come about should Lanys complete the staff. He revealed parts of Malevolence's history so history need not repeat itself.<br>

<br>
From the Journal of Dorvias N`Keth...<br>
<br>
Innoruuk preserve me for my hate grows stronger still this day. Blasted Mistmoore, always with his foul nose in that which does not concern him. Teir`Dal he may have been but that was long, long ago. He has grown arrogant and no longer swears fealty to Innoruuk or any other. The Bloodmoon was mine to protect, mine to care for! However... he is a powerful ally. His &quot;help&quot; is neither needed nor welcomed but I do not doubt his ability to keep the stone safe. It may be that we loyal to hate might benefit from his allegiance in the future, so I do not wish to count him as enemy. He may watch over the stone for the time being, it might even serve to further complicate matters for the bastard Lanys T`Vyl, so I shall leave it be.<br>
<br>
The Ring of Scale becomes a whole new concern. If the fool dragon Irin`ka Set was to be believed, then Trakanon's aid may soon be required, I don't care what Ashteth believes. Trakanon can be controlled; he has worldly desires and so can be manipulated. Further, his fury at the Ring of Scale itself will ensure his loyalty to our cause. It is Trakanon who might tip the scales in our favor when all is said and done... and perhaps as an added reward for all of my time invested, he might just do the thing that Irin`Ka Set failed to do- kill Zavo`Zatanov. Her arrogance and stubbornness will not go forgotten. It is only a fool that works against the will of Innoruuk, and there is no room in this world for the foolish.<br>
<br>
What comes next should be interesting indeed. I have made no friends in the Ring of Scale and may very well find myself at their doorstep soon. This is yet another reason to retain the good graces of Mistmoore. I have never fully learned the inspiration of his silent war with the dragons, but if it may be used to the benefit of Innoruuk then so be it. The bastard child Lanys will not succeed in rebuilding Malevolence. That is the bottom line. That is the will of Innoruuk himself, and so shall it be no matter the cost.<br>

Basically the King and Queen of Neriak, Mayong Mistmoore, and the Prince of Hate himself gathered their forces for a final showdown with Lanys before she could complete the staff 'Malevolence'. After a huge battle in the Mountains of Rathe, Lanys was defeated and killed, or at least taken back to Plane of Hate, the new Chosen of Innoruuk was rescued, Mayong completed the staff and gave it to Innoruuk, who gave it in turn to the Arch-Priest of Hate, Dorvias N`Keth.<br>

Sooo... she's dead. I guess this whole thing amounted to a small scale battle in rathe mountains which prolly has alrdy happened and about 10 ppl saw it. <br>
On another note about the plague, Qeynos found a cure, which was however stolen by a Brigang (bandit). <br>
