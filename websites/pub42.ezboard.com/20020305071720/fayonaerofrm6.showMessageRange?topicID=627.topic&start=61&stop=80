In fact, I'd say that a jury has a moral obligation to protect society from a person they have judged to be a murderer.  And that judgement doesnt come from a simple vote where majority rules, the jury must unanimously vote guilty.<br>

Post Script:  Damn, Bri added another post <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The definition Furt quoted is a standard set by man.  However, the laws set by man are the only laws we have.  It looks like Bri's question is, &quot;Do we have the right to execute someone who has killed another?&quot;  The only answer to that is, &quot;Yes.  The laws we have set give us that right.&quot;<br>
<br>
If you ask, &quot;Are those laws moral?&quot; I can only answer, &quot;Morality is ethereal.  Laws are concrete.  What one persons morals allow, anothers do not.&quot;<br>
<br>
I dont think we can base earthly laws on morality.  Earlier, Taino put out an example of a man being put in jail for driving without a license.  The man was legally in the wrong.  However, a persons morals might say, &quot;It was ok for him to drive because his wife was having an emergency.&quot;  Morals also might say that it is wrong for a man to have sex with a woman if they are not married.  But that is not the law.<br>
<br>
A jury is not judging the moral or ethical acts of a person.  They are simply to decide if the person acted inside or outside of the law.<br>

As for protecting society, the death penalty is the ONLY guaranteed way to protect society.  If you put a man in prison &quot;for life&quot; there is ALWAYS the possibility for escape.  Or he might kill again in prison.  <br>

I wanted to point out that my brother may have made a fault. But its in no way something serious.<br>
<br>
Yeah he deserved losing his licence.<br>
But he does not deserve being treated like a bankrobberer, murderer, a guy that rapes children and so on. <br>
Do you think he deserves no more real life? No more chance? That he should rot in prison and be the scum of the society and put away from everyone 'oh so legal' because he once was in prison?<br>
This is how you seem to want Criminals treated, and all I wanted to point out is that not every Criminal is as criminal then others. And this is the problem when people just talk about 'Criminals', its goddamn unfair. <br>
<br>
My brother drove his car a little drunk. I bet my ass 80% of you all have at one time or the other just once driven your car with a little more alcohol in your blood then allowed. Mind you, 2 beers are enough for that. <br>
Then his wife had an emergency. Well, I know he should have found another possibility to get to her, but he was in panic, it was about his wife!!! I again bet my ass 80% of you all don't give a damn about drivewrs license or not when you NEED to reach your wife NOW and youjust have your car there.<br>
Then you will not like call a friend to pick you up. You will simply not do that.<br>
Then he gets caught again and ends up for 120 goddamn days in prison. He is being called a criminal, he will never have a chance for a good job anymore becasue he is a criminal, people don't trust him anymore because he is a criminal, and so on.<br>
How fair is this?<br>
Especially when I see your judgement about 'Criminals' and how miserable they all are. <br>
<br>
I just want one thing. I beg to differ. <br>
<br>
You all always keep bringing up those huge examples. KIll your wife and keep her in the frezer for a month and then eat her.. well thats NOT the casual Criminal, thats not even the casual Murderer. Those cases are not the ones that make poeple not believe in Death Penalty or that made people give the prisoners the possibility to learn during their time.<br>
<br>
Do you think my brother did not deserve TV and Books during those 120 days? Do you think he would have deserve being beaten up in prison, being handled like a piece of shit (as he was), losing all hope and self esteem? <br>
<br>
As I said, I beg to differ!<br>
<br>
And Stymp.<br>
You have no clue about psychology.<br>
'She had 30 years time to leave her husband'...<br>
You have no clue what is going on in the head of such a woman. She can't eave him. He is scared, she is in hell, she sees no way, she wants to protect her family, her children, she can't run away. SHe also hides behind things like 'when he is sober, he can be really nice, and he sure is sorry for what he does' for many years.<br>
Stymp, you have no clue. It is so easy to just say what you did and close your eyes for a persons situation and reasons.<br>
<br>
THe world is not black and white and it will never be.<br>
EVERYONE of us at ONE point did SOMETHING illegal. NOONE is an Angel, simply noone is a friggen angel. Everyone has his story, his dark sides and good sides.<br>
<br>
Some poeple are simply evil and mentally sick. But most people have a valid reason for their actions. THis doesn't mean the actions are not wrong, this just means, that every case is unique and that Death Penalty and a simple 12 guys Jury will NOT solve these problems. And this is why its wrong.<br>
<br>
Again, that sick 'his wife eater' needs a psychiatric clinic for the rest of his life. Those cases are pretty clear. <br>
But most cases simply AREN'T. <br>
<br>
And to stamp every person that ever broke the law as 'CRIMINAL' is not right (80% of us are criminals then, including me, I smoke pot), and to judge Death Penalty for every person that has killed someone is not right either. Because every case is unique and you cannot judge a general punishment over thousands of unique cases. <p><center><A href="mailto:taino@jollyjokers.com"><img src="http://www.jollyjokers.com/images/taino.jpg" border=0 alt="Send me a Mail"></a><br><FONT color=#ffffff

<br>
First, dont tell me I dont have any clue about psychology.  I know what I have experienced.  I have seen those women in the hospital.  I have seen their black eyes, their bruises, and their scars.  I've sat through groups with them, talked with them, and cried with them.  It is horrible what an abused spouse goes through.  But none of what they go through gives them the right to kill their abuser.  And they DO have all those years to escape.  Gather up the kids and drive to the police station.  I'd bet 90% of the spousal abuse in the US could be stopped if the woman would just TESTIFY against her husband!  But the dont.  They make up excuses.  And once again I am not saying they deserve what happens to them, but by staying in that situation they bring it on themselves.<br>
<br>
Second, a criminal is someone convicted of a crime.  Smoke all the pot you want, it doesnt make you a criminal until you are caught, tried, and convicted of possessing narcotics.<br>
<br>
Third, your brother is a criminal.  He drove drunk, lost his license, and kept on driving.  He was caught driving without his license and was tried and convicted for it.  It is most certainly NOT &quot;goddamn unfair&quot;.  He gets more chances after he serves his time.  And if people look at his record and see that he served time for driving without a license, then that is just something he will have to deal with.  It is a consequence of his action.  You're talking as if he didnt do anything illegal and doesnt deserve anything that happened to him.  Well, I hate to tell you, but driving without a license IS illegal.  And if you are caught and convicted of breaking the law, then you deserve whatever happens.  I hope for his sake that he learned a lesson.<br>
<br>
Fourth, all cases are unique.  And not all cases are tried for the death penalty.  I dont know how you think things work, but it sounds like you have the wrong impression.  Not every person being charged with murder is going up against the death penalty.  The prosecution makes that determination based on the case they have.<br>

The majority of murderers do not receive the death penalty.  There are several categories to prosecute someone who has taken a life, and only the truly severe ones are classified in the category that allows the death penalty as an option.  Compare the number of murders to the number of people on death row - it's not rocket science.  You make it sound like every accused murderer is escorted from the witness stand to the electric chair five minutes after the jury comes back, but that is nowhere near how it works.<br>
<br>
As for your brother, YES it was something serious.  Twenty years ago driving drunk was no big deal.  Then, finally people started to realize how many innocent people lose their lives due to that kind of carelessness by others and it became a bigger deal.  Your brother is incredibly lucky he didn't kill someone that night.  He was fortunate that the only punishment alotted to him was a license suspension.  He was stupid to look that gift horse in the mouth regardless of the situation.  If he was as panicked as you make it sound - he probably had no business driving in that condition either - even if he'd had a license at the time.  Obviously he did something to cause him to be pulled over on the way to that emergency.  The cop didn't see him drive by and just psychically know he didn't have a license in his wallet.<br>
<br>
Should he have been treated like a criminal? Yes.  He should be treated like what he is.  He broke the law, not once, but twice.  Deprivation of books and tv?  Millions of people live that way 24/7 without breaking the law, how heartbreaking that he might miss out on a few luxuries while he's being punished for breaking the law.  He wasn't treated with respect while he was in jail?  Cry me a river, he should have thought of that before he broke the law in the first place.<br>
<br>
Regardless, your brother's self-induced situation has absolutely nothing to do with a discussion on the death penalty.  I wonder though, if your brother was lying rotting in a box underground because some other guy who had a couple beers after work and hit the brakes 2 seconds too late, would you still consider it &quot;in no way something serious&quot;?  I wonder, would you like to see the pictures of my grandfather's car, after it was T-boned by a blazer that ran a red and they used the jaws of life on it?  Would you like me to describe in detail the last 3 days of my grandfather's life, which he spent comatose in a hospital bed while we all stood around wishing for just any sign of recovery?  The guy who hit him had a bac UNDER the legal limit, and my grandfather is still dead.  The guy who killed him sent a short letter of apology to my grandmother, magnanimously admitting he shouldn't have had that beer at 10 AM, then promptly skipped town - five years later they still haven't found him.  I guess he's afraid he might spend some time not being treated with respect in jail.  In the meantime, do you think I could give a shit if this guy has lost hope and self esteem?  There is only one difference between this guy and your brother - the cops caught your brother before he registered that red light 2 seconds too late. <p><img src=http://www.kaseyspace.com/EQ/nenasig.jpg align=center>

An elderly man replied to his ad by showing up at the family's doorstep. He offered the young man a job on his farm. He left and returned a few days later carrying groceries supposedly from his farm. They invited him to stay for dinner. At the dinner table he met the daughter, Gracie. Before he left he talked Gracie's parents into letting her go to his niece's birthday party with him. And he assured them that she would return by 9pm. People were extremely trusting of strangers in 1928. The man never returned with Gracie.<br>
<br>
6 years later the mother receives this letter:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   &quot;My dear Mrs. Budd,<br>
<br>
In 1894 a friend of mine shipped as a deck hand on the Steamer Tacoma, Capt. John Davis.  They sailed from San Francisco for Hong Kong China.  On arriving there he and two others went ashore and got drunk.  When they returned the boat was gone.<br>
<br>
At that time there was famine in China. Meat of any kind was from $1 to 3 Dollars a pound.  So great was the suffering among the very poor that all children under 12 were sold for food in order to keep others from starving.  A boy or girl under 14 was not safe in the street.  You could go in any shop and ask for steak -- chops -- or stew meat.  Part of the naked body of a boy or girl would be brought out and just what you wanted cut from it.  A boy or girls behind which is the sweetest part of the body and sold as veal cutlet brought the highest price.<br>
<br>
John staid there so long he acquired a taste for human flesh.  On his return to N.Y. he stole two boys one 7 one 11.  Took them to his home stripped them naked tied them in a closet.  Then burned everything they had on.  Several times every day and night he spanked them -- tortured them -- to make their meat good and tender. <br>
<br>
First he killed the 11 year old boy, because he had the fattest ass and of course the most meat on it.  Every part of his body was Cooked and eaten except the head -- bones and guts.  He was Roasted in the oven (all of his ass), boiled, broiled, fried and stewed.  The little boy was next, went the same way.  At that time, I was living at 409 E 100 st., near -- right side.  He told me so often how good Human flesh was I made up my mind to taste it.<br>
<br>
On Sunday June the 3 --1928 I called on you at 406 W 15 St.  Brought you pot cheese -- strawberries.  We had lunch.  Grace sat in my lap and kissed me.  I made up my mind to eat her.<br>
<br>
On the pretense of taking her to a party.  You said Yes she could go.   I took her to an empty house in Westchester I had already picked out.  When we got there, I told her to remain outside.  She picked wildflowers.  I went upstairs and stripped all my clothes off.  I knew if I did not I would get her blood on them.<br>
<br>
When all was ready I went to the window and Called her.  Then I hid in a closet until she was in the room.  When she saw me all naked she began to cry and tried to run down the stairs.  I grabbed her and she said she would tell her mamma. <br>
<br>
First I stripped her naked.  How she did kick -- bite and scratch.   I choked her to death, then cut her in small pieces so I could take my meat to my rooms.  Cook and eat it.  How sweet and tender her little ass was roasted in the oven.  It took me 9 days to eat her entire body.  I did not fuck her tho I could of had I wished.  She died a virgin.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

This is probably the worst letter ever received in the history of man. People like this deserve to die. They don't deserve to live out the rest of their lives in a prison with a television, access to excercise equipment, and 3 square meals a day while some below par psychiatrist tries to figure out whats wrong with them. I'll tell ya whats wrong with them: They're crazy! What made em crazy?: Probably some sad event or situation in thier life (ie: molested as a child, emotionally/physically abused, outcast from society, change in financial status, grew up in a poor neighborhood where gangbangin' was the only way to survive!) Thats some really sad stuff, but its not an excuse for murder. 99% of the people in this world live less than perfect childhoods but we're still expected to keep some sense of right and wrong. Thats the big picture I'm looking at. Sentencing a murderer to death is not murder, thats justice.<br>

Murder is a word created and defined by man.  It has a specific definition that I quoted.  You can have whatever opinion you want about the morality of the death penalty but to call it &quot;murder&quot; is 100% wrong.  Use another term or phrase if you must, e.g. wrongful killing, immoral act, etc., but don't call it murder.<br>
<br>
As for all of the hyperboles being thrown around, I'm not sure they help your argument.  In my mind the debate centers around two related main points.<br>
<br>
(1) what is the maximum punishment society should inflict on its criminals?  If you believe that there are absolutely no circumstances where the death penalty should be used as a punishment then there's no need to go to step 2.  You would be in the very small minority of people (most people can think of at least some extreme examples where the death penalty would be justified--e.g. Hitler).  If you're in this camp, there's very little point in debating the topic.  You're not going to convince me that it's never justified and I'm not going to convince you that it's sometimes justified.<br>
<br>
(2)  if there are circumstances that the death penalty is justified, then what level of &quot;comfort&quot; do you require to impose the death penalty.  For some it may be 100% positive proof of guilt of a heinous crime.  In the U.S. the standard is (i) only certain heinous crimes can have the death penalty imposed (ii) guilt proven beyond a reasonable doubt and (iii) a unanimous determination by 12 members of society that the punishment should be the death penalty after considering all mitigating factors.<br>
<br>
I'm comfortable with the standard used in the U.S.  Many people would prefer more of a &quot;comfort&quot; level for the U.S. and cite inadequate public defenders on capital cases, disparate racial makeup for deathrow inmates, and type of execution used. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/udenoineanduril.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Denoine Anduril</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/28/01 8:14:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=627.topic&index=72>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lets kill everyone who kills!</span><hr size=1> I read the story of Fish from the web site.<br>

I just wanted to throw my opinion in here.<br>
<br>
I believe that people are responsible for their own choices.  Yes, chemicals can and do play a part, so I'm not going to talk about those exceptions - because there are exceptions.  (I had severe post-partum after the birth of my daughter - I was able to recognize that was what it was, and that it would pass - but knowing that didn't make it go away, or make it any easier to live with).<br>
<br>
To Taino:<br>
I agree that things are never black and white, right or wrong.  I also believe that if you go back and read your posts, you saying that is somewhat hypocritical, as you take the extreme other-side of the spectrum.<br>
<br>
People own their choices.  We are free to make those choices.  There is no 'right' or 'wrong', 'black' or 'white'.  There are only better or worse, and what's better in one instance, may be worse in another.  EVERY instance must be judged individually.<br>
<br>
I grew up in a physically abusive home.  Do I beat my children?  NO!  I CHOOSE NOT TO!  That is my choice, and I own it.  Shouldn't someone with the same background who does choose to beat their children also own that choice?<br>
<br>
(I feel myself going off topic here)<br>
<br>
My opinion is that the death penalty is appropriate in some cases, and not in others, because EVERY instance is different, even when the crimes appear the same on the outside.  Rehabilitation is a wonderful thought, but it's just not going to happen in all cases, because some people will CHOOSE not to be rehabilitated.<br>
<br>
Everyone has the right to make their own choices.  We all must accept responsibility for those choices!  If we CHOOSE to go out and kill someone, we must own that choice, and whatever consequences go along with it.<br>
<br>
I see a disturbing trend arising, and that is that people are not willing to allow their children to  accept responsibility for their own actions / choices.  I see parents defending the actions of their children, and claiming the responsibility for anything from missing school to &quot;He didn't mean to hit so and so, we had a rough morning at home, and he was just displacing that anger&quot;.  This is just not right!  Not only does it teach children irresponsibility, but it takes away their RIGHT to own their choices, and understand the beauty and power of what freedom of choice give us!  The right to make a better life for ourselves. (or a worse one)<br>
<br>
Saying that someone commits a crime because one was committed against them does not make that CHOICE the better choice!  No!  People choose what they do, and how they react to every situation.<br>
<br>
It is what gives us the power to make our lives wonderful, rich, full.  (Or if you chose the contrary)<br>
<br>
<br>
---I'm afraid I have gone completely off here..  I hope you can see the point I was trying to make, and how it applies to the subject.<br>
<br>
p.s.  I know what the prisons are like here in the US.  What are they like in Sweden / other places?  Could it be that some peoples opinions about prison being enough, are based on the premise that their prison systems are more appropriate 'punishment'?  I honestly have no clue what they are like.<br>
