Here goes…<br><br><br>A couple groups from my guild zoned into Old Seblis one night. We had just finished a raid in another zone, and since we were all still together and somewhat pumped, we decided to go and take a shot at the Juggernaut camp, seeing as we had a few people who desired some spells. It was kind of late for those of us living on the East coast of the United States however, so there was a little bit of time pressure to get to the camp and get things working.<br><br>We zoned in. Standing around the zone-in hallway, was a slightly larger crowd than normal, some of whom were evidently content to pull frogs to the zone in single pulls and then pulp them.<br><br>Guildmember_03 Shouts &quot;CAMP CHECK&quot;<br><br>The one that we were paying the most attention for was someone replying &quot;JUGGS&quot;, and if that was camped, then we were going to head down to the Myconid King camp for a healthy dose of frustration.<br><br>A number of replies came back over both the public channels, including &quot;JUGGS&quot;…<br><br>Fantasy_Lad shouts &quot;JUGGS&quot;<br><br>Valarian says to the guild &quot;Well poop. Juggs is taken, and so is King. What now?&quot;<br>Guildmember_11 tells the guild &quot;What else is available?&quot;<br>Guildmember_05 tells the guild &quot;Wait. That was Fantasy_Lad who answered that camp check, right? He's right here at the zone.&quot;<br><br>I swivel about in place a bit, scanning the crowd. Sure enough, there's Fantasy_Lad, along with a clutch of his fellow guildmembers. I start to recall what I know about this character…<br><br>To make it simple, he's a person who's never been caught doing anything wrong himself, but most of his associates are people of poor reputation and generally behave like chimpanzees on a bad acid trip while watching the movie 'Brazil'. Myself, I tend to mark a person by the company they keep (this includes guilds) if I have no personal experience with them.<br><br>Valarian tells Fantasy_Lad &quot;Can I get on the list for that camp? I'm a monk, Run 3, fish, delightful personality and nice thighs.&quot;<br>Fantasy_Lad tells Valarian &quot;Sorry, guildcamp only.&quot;<br>Valarian tells Fantasy_Lad &quot;What guild?&quot;<br><br>Valarian tells the guild &quot;Hold on. Checking something.&quot;<br><br>Fantasy_Lad tells Valarian &quot;XXXXXXXX.&quot; (insert guildname here)<br>Valarian tells Fantasy_Lad &quot;Juggs is a fairly large area. How many in your camp?&quot;<br>Fantasy_Lad tells Valarian &quot; 9&quot;<br><br>I take a fast headcount of the members of guild 'XXXXXXXX'. I count nine at the zone.<br>/who<br>I look over the /who list, and I see that there are only nine members of the XXXXXXXX guild in Old Seblis right now.<br>I don't even bother to match names to who's at the zone.<br><br>Valarian tells the guild &quot;There's enuf evidence in front of me to say that Fantasy_Lad is lying. Mobilize, let's move fast.&quot;<br>Guildmember_03 tells the guild &quot;Wait. Let's play it safe. I don't want to step on any toes.&quot;<br>Guildmember_03 shouts &quot;CAMP CHECK&quot;<br><br>In the myriad of replies, once again one can see Fantasy_Lad shout &quot;JUGGS&quot;.<br><br>Now, myself, it being near my bedtime and having to work the next day, I'm in somewhat of a hurry to get something done. If I could have seen Fantasy_Lad at least say &quot;OTM JUGGS&quot;, I would have had much more respect and not felt lied to. But as it was, I did feel lied to, and therefore this person deserved no special consideration.<br><br>Valarian tells the guild &quot;He's right here beside us, and he's still saying that he and his crew are in Juggs.&quot;<br>Valarian tells the guild &quot;100,000 sperm, and he was the fastest?&quot;<br>Guildmember_05 tells the guild &quot;That guild suXors. I say we just head to juggs and screw them.&quot;<br>Guildmember_03 tells the guild &quot;My gods, the lag is amazing here.&quot;<br><br>Guildmember_03 had been having some minor lag problems all night, but they were magnified to a extreme once she zoned into Old Seblis. Whenever she walked, she looked kind of like a mime with a hangover, she was jerking around and slamming into walls so much. Her lag would cause several communication delays through the night, as well as at least one attempt to reduce the lag by her logging off and re-booting from desktop.<br><br>Valarian tells Fantasy_Lad &quot;Pardon me again, but any chance we could share the camp with you?&quot;<br>Fantasy_Lad tells Valarian &quot;No&quot;<br>Valarian tells Fantasy_Lad &quot;You sure?&quot;<br><br>Valarian tells the guild &quot;C'mon, let's go.&quot;<br><br>Fantasy_Lad tells Valarian &quot;We're using it all.&quot;<br>Valarian tells Fantasy_Lad &quot;You sure? We can't work something out?&quot;<br><br>Valarian tells the guild &quot;C'mon, we can beat them there!&quot;<br>Guildmember_03 tells the guild &quot;Hold on&quot;<br><br>Fantasy_Lad tells Valarian &quot;It's our camp, and we're not sharing&quot;<br><br>Keep in mind I'm right beside Fantasy_Lad.<br><br>Valarian says &quot;No sharing? Damn shame…&quot;<br>Fantasy_Lad tells Valarian &quot;What's your problem? When are you going to get the clue?&quot;<br>Valarian says &quot;What clue?&quot;<br>Fantasy_Lad tells Valarian &quot;I told you several times, it's our camp! Stop bugging me!&quot;<br>Valarian says &quot;I'm bugging you?&quot;<br><br>Valarian tells the guild &quot;This guys as bright as a box of hair. Let's roll! C'mon!&quot;<br><br>Someone else shouts for a camp check, and a different member of  XXXXXXXX guild replies with &quot;JUGGS&quot;.<br><br>Fantasy_Lad tells Valarian &quot;You're being a asshole!&quot;<br>Valarian says &quot;Uh-huh.&quot;<br>Valarian says &quot;Camp check&quot;<br><br>Fantasy_Lad finally looks around. It's only in my mind that I could see this, but I couldn't help but see Fantasy_Lad's eyes go wide when he saw me beside him. I had a desperate urge to…<br>…Why fight it? Go with the urge.<br><br>Valarian *SMACKS* Fantasy_Lad with a fish! Twice!<br><br>Guildmember_03 tells the guild &quot;OTM&quot; (On The Move)<br><br>And out we rolled for Juggs.<br><br>We never got there that night, due to one accidental training from XXXXXXXX guild as they tried to run past us (I really do believe it was an accident, because they got caught also), and a variety of lag problems, one weird aggro, and finally people having to log for the night (including myself).<br><br>I'd like to give a special thanks to Kaldolaf for helping a few friends of mine with a accidental case of death at one point while they were in Old Seblis. He went out of his way to help them get ressurected and back on their feet. I've know Kaldolaf for a while, and he's always been a considerate player.<br><br>We hung around in the King camp for a while though, playing with pathing and amusing ourselves for a bit. While we were there, I saw several camp checks go by.<br><br>Random_Character shouts &quot;CAMP CHECK&quot;<br>Fantasy_Lad shouts &quot;OTM JUGGS&quot;<br>They never passed us.<br><br><br><br>With Tolerance For The Stupidity Of The Evidence…<br><br>Valarian<br><br><br>P.S. Many of my fellow guildmembers are going to read this and go either &quot;Oh, THAT'S what he was doing!&quot; or &quot;I don't remember any of this. Except for Fener running his face into that 'shroom's crotch.&quot;<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/umirajtheenchanter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Miraj the Enchanter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(3/8/02 6:44:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1074.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.freakygamers.com/smilies/s2/contrib/edoom/Wizard.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Missing something?</span><hr size=1> as much as your story is great what is the purpose of going after someone else's camped...<br><br>i understand they shoulda shouted OTW to D2...but personally, when i had crypt taken from me it made me mad as hell, what is the purpose of arguing and screwing with other people?<br><br>/sigh<br>yeah yeah, flame me...but personally I'd let them have it and take Chef =/ <p><img src=http://members.aol.com/mirajenchanter/smash.jpg><BR><BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=98630"> <b>Miraj </b>the Self Proclaimed "Verant Hating" <b><u>Enchanter</a></b></u><BR>Verant<img src=http://www.members.aol.com/mirajenchanter/whack.gif>Your Social Life</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/umirajtheenchanter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Miraj the Enchanter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(3/8/02 6:47:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1074.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.freakygamers.com/smilies/s2/contrib/edoom/Wizard.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Missing something?</span><hr size=1> err, it wasn't their camp...but it may have been CR or what not =/ you get what I meant..(editting 1st sentence) =/<br><br>and i meant the general OTM (not to D2, it was juggs, yeah yeah) <p><img src=http://members.aol.com/mirajenchanter/smash.jpg><BR><BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=98630"> <b>Miraj </b>the Self Proclaimed "Verant Hating" <b><u>Enchanter</a></b></u><BR>Verant<img src=http://www.members.aol.com/mirajenchanter/whack.gif>Your Social Life</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ugilthianis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gilthianis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(3/8/02 7:01:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1074.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Missing something?</span><hr size=1> I think Point is they were not at Juggs, and its sorta bad mojo to say your in a camp when really your not.
