Does anyone remember the days when you first entered lower guk (after having some good friend show you for the sixth time how to get through upper guk) Do any of you guys remember there being 60 people in Cazic-thule, and people actually fighting over weather or not there should be two groups doing sewers. Can anyone remember when the only place you could hunt once you reached lvl 50 was lower guk or solb. Then came Kunark and does anyone remember when there would be a TON of people in sebilis, or in Karnor. Ah yes, the kunark expansion the beginning of the end of the true dungeon hunters. For a long time the die hard dungeon crawlers went to sebilis and still enjoyed the difficulty of a six person group with not-so great equipment trying to take on a pretty well laid out dungeon. But Kunark also brought up an entirely new EQ type of player. How many of the &quot;new generation&quot; of eq player learns what assist means while they are trying to figure out the intricate nature of hunting on the ledge in OT, or even learn how to make that assist key when they hit that all involved ridge group in DL. At least once you hit lvl 50 you had to learn how to play your class in a tough dungeon type of situation, unless of course you discover velketors and learn to join 40 other people chasing around 3 spiders and are calling that a dungeon experience) Then comes SoL and now I can see plenty of &quot;DL ridge group potential&quot; all over the place. Soon I think there will be no place for the true dungeon crawlers at all. Sure there are dungeons in SoL catering only to the &quot;larger guild groups&quot; that will be going in to take out boss mobs, or guild farming groups. But what of the 6 person pick up group that is able to take out a mob with &quot;reasonable hit pts&quot; for exp and lewts in and of itself. Another thing I have noticed is that once you are post 50 the whole &quot;pick up group&quot; situation is over. By the time you are in the post 50 game, most people have devided into Guilds and what not and are very slow to just get in any pick up groups anymore. I know everyone aboars pick up groups but if you think back to your eq beginnings, what got you soooooo hooked on the game in the first place was the Fun, and yes Risk of fighting with complete strangers.<br><br>Think of the time when, yes even &quot;YOU&quot; were a newbie, and you would group with some  people you didnt even know. Did you not have a blast? Did you not have so much fun that you went nuts on a video game and have now spent WAY more play time on it than you would have ever thought possible before getting eq? Does anyone ever think of how the game is different post 50 than it was when you were still learning the game? When you were say lvl 20, you went to your zone of choice, called out for a group, when said group was formed you had NO CLUE if it was a good group or not, but you hunted anyway and had fun. Now that you are 50, you log in spend 20 minutes just figuring out what your guild is doing for the day, if nothing you then see if any substantial amount of &quot;guildies&quot; are going to do anything that you yourself might be inclined to join in on. <br><br>I only mention all of this because my sister moved in with me recently, and I got her hooked on everquest. Last weekend, she asked me to play her character (22 ranger I had made for her) while she went to the store. Her group had broken up shortly after she left, so I went about forming another group. By the time she got back I had formed a 6 person meat grinding xp raping twinkie group. We had a psycho puller, druid,(for sow of course) Cleric, Ranger, Monk, Rogue. We were lawn mowers. I was proud of the &quot;twinkie group&quot; I had formed and figured she would be totally stoked at how fast the exp was comming in. She gets home and I turn it back over to her, and about half an hour later she degroups and loggs for a bit. I asked her how come she left the group and she tells me &quot;the group was great experience but it was boring as hell&quot; I was like why is it boring you where fighting non stop? she told me because nobody was saying a damn word, it was all about killing and there was never any talking. There were no &quot;close calls' on dying or anything we were just like a machine. <br><br>I had forgotten how fun it was to be with people I didnt know and actually goof off and have fun. Its not about what is the maximum exp you can suck out of a zone, its about meeting new people and joking and risk. Thats why I hope verant figures out a way of making an over populated deep ass dungeon viable again. Because even in the old days, I remember having a ton of fun with pick up groups (yes even though you met jerks, they at least gave you something or someone to joke about) But there was always a lot of fun in meeting new people, and the &quot;daily grind of the xp monster&quot; wasnt such a terrible thing in those days. <br><br>Anyway, I was bored and thought I would throw some of my own thoughts of late about the game at you guys to see if you beat up on me bad or not.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ualiasisudonomo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aliasi Sudonomo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/6/02 8:35:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=782.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ Evolution</span><hr size=1> I think you are correct in thinking that a person can now level to 50+ - 60, even - without any real dungeon experience, or close calls, or what have you... Mainly because this is exactly what happens nowadays.<br><br>I don't see an actual problem with this, however. EQ is a multiplayer game but you aren't really competing with anyone (unless you're on a Zek, natch). You can play just about any style you find fun as long as you can find one or two other folks who are willing to play in a similar fashion. Even fewer, if you can tolerate soloing.<br><br>I do agree with the general idea that if you aren't having fun in some way, you ought to quit doing it.

I really loved LGuk. Dead side of course, the living frogs there are good so of course I would not kill them. Overcrowding was a bitvh, but that was the only real problem. And undercrowding is worse, with no pickup groups to get and so much frogs that you will get wiped out unless you have such a powerful group that the camp will get boring once you have cleared it the first time.<br><br>Before the guild politics, and before the everlasting NBG conflict. Back in guk in my days everyone rolled for everything, and that was that. Period. It might not have been the best system of distribution as such, but it was simple and most importantly free from bitching. One of the biggest drawbacks of kunark and beyond is that once a good item drops ia a pickupgroup, there will be three persons demanding different versions of need before greed, tvo demanding that everyone rolls, and one who log in fisgust after hearing these five morons yelling at each other for a few hours. I used to be that sixth person, and that's one of the main reasons why i more or less stopped doing pickupgrousp. <br><br>The main reason however, was that groups started to fall apart much more often. In Guk I spent two hours on a list while playing my twink, and once I had joined I could stay for as long as I wanted. People would leave, but they would get replaced. And people chatted and roleplayed a lot, it wasn't the mindless xp-grinding machine. In Karnor's I would spend 30 minutes searching for a group and then 10 minutes in that group untill it got trained out and lost it's camp or fell apart for other raesons. In Sebilis I would spend two hours searching for a group, and once we gotten to our camp we could not get reinforcements and not move to other groups ourselves. The group typically lasted for 30 minutes to two hours and then broke up, usually because someone had to leave or we had to evac. In guk we just took our camp back after evac, but in Sebilis there was ALWAYS some key class that would get bored as soona s things didn't go perfect and who we would not find a replacement for in time. Plus, the crypt was boring as hell! When I came back to Sebilis far later at much higher level, I learned to enjoy Chef, King and Disco. However, that was mostly with premade groups of friends and guildies. <p>Love, Edeina<br>Highelf Arch Mage of Erollisi.<br>Citizen of <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero">Ayonae Ro</a>, member of <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/beternalwrath">Eternal Wrath</a>.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uhalochanter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HaloChanter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local Resident</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/6/02 2:22:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=782.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ Evolution</span><hr size=1> Sandin54..

What is eq, if not an experience to interact and meet people? Not the same people, day in and day out, but different people! <br>Although that brings me to my other point, different people like different things. Endless people on these boards avoid pick up groups at all costs, mainly perhaps due to these 'outdoor manufactured' eq players that have begin to grow at a substansial rate. <br>Either way, I'm ready to put up with the odd moron, or loot 'whore', if it means I get to meet new people and just have a blast.

By 'ruin' I mean some of what you describe, in addition to twinking; new players come into the game, and instead of having a chance to learn the joys and pitfalls of the game for themselves, they run into some 'well meaning' players who force feed them a tutorial on how to 'optimize' their character, from what gear they should get, to where they should exp for fastest levelling, etc, and an image is formed in the players mind that *this* is what the game is about - getting uber gear and levelling to 50 as fast as possible so that they can start playing the 'real' game, where everyone else is.  Many people who might get a lot out of EQ, and become good players, come face to face with this reality and quit, or put their noses to the grindstone and level to 50 with blinders on, missing out on much of the game and valuable skill development in the process.<br><br>I started playing EQ about 10 months ago, when the game was relatively 'mature', and had a fantastic time dying over and over again in Gfay, Steamfont, Crushbone, and Unrest, and was starting to explore Antonica, when some 'well meaning' friends suggested that I could get great experience in the Oasis and that I should head there.  Getting my first Orc highway group was great, but it was the beginning of my introduction to the soulless, maddeningly boring experience grind that many of my companions seemed to be hell bent on.  I was also given my first piece of twink gear from another chanter at that time, a polished bone mask (which I still have).  About that time, two of my partners friends (we all started playing about the same time) asked if I would join a guild with them; I did, but it was a bad fit - it was a guild comprised mostly of hyper kids who were out for loot, and I didn't stay long.<br><br>Without boring everyone to tears with the rest of this story, I and my partner found that the only way to 'keep' the game for ourselves, and not have it be ruined, was to insist on learning it all on our own.  In the last 8 months we've crawled, at appropriate level, with equally inexperienced friends, all of the old world dungeons except Najena (went there late for a couple of quests) and Sol B (this is on our list), several of the Kunark dungeons (Kurn's tower, Droga, Kaesora), and ToFS in Velious.  We've died a LOT, and had a blast, but one of the sad things is that many of these places were completely empty except for us (or one or two farmers) when we got there.  In many of the mid level dungeons, you *can't* get pickup groups any more, yet there are 100+ in LOIO, 70 in the Oasis, and 100+ in the OT and Dreadlands.<br><br>You may think that these are all twinks and/or alts, trying to level up as fast as they can, but the simple truth is many of them SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ELSE, having been 'indoctrinated' at an early age.<br><br>Case in point:  Last night, our little guild took two of our newer but higher level members, a 45 Necro, and a 42 SK, on their *first* dungeon crawl (if you want to call it that, we were just sticking our heads in Nurga, since our planned target of Droga was, amazingly enough, taken with two groups that night).  When I pleaded with them that our ranger was our main assist, and to please stay on one mob at a time (I am an enchanter, mind you, so the adds were getting quickly parked), the SK looked right at me and said, Why?  I then explained that fighting multiple mobs was a drain on the healers resources, and besides, many of the mobs here were casters who would heal themselves or cast at players.  They insisted on soloing mobs for a while, until we came upon a room of rockchanters, and our poor SK watched in dismay as the (low blue to her) creature healed itself faster than she could damage it...  She swore for a while after that, but assisted the Ranger from then on <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  The necro, on the other hand, insisted on running herself and her pet ahead of the party, periodically screaming 'my pet is fighting xxx, come here', which was not a party threatening experience under these circumstances, but will be soon...<br><br>On the plus side, I'd like to add that the most fun we had over the course of the evening was *finding* the Mines of Nurga in FM that night, after we found that Droga was taken.  With the new graphics, everything looks different, we had never been in that dungeon, and Faer took us to what he *thought* was it but was in fact the burynai mining camp.  Our group of eager beavers swarmed the 'zone entrance' only to be met by a horde of angry burynai, quickly accompanied by a couple of giants, goblins and a brute that wandered down the hill into the carnage.  Several minutes of stark raving chaos ensued, punctuated by mezz messages, 'the next target *is* ' messages, a dead cleric (who was, amazingly enough, the only fatality), and about 20 dead bodies on the ground when it was all over...  Oh and btw, our SK was *thrilled* about the shovel she got from the Mines, insisted that we take screenshots of her wielding it, and started screaming at the mobs to 'Die by my shovel, you XXX!'.  She has had more fun with that shovel than the superb weapon we brought her from KC the other day... <br><br>I guess my 'point' (if there is one) in this message is that, even though EQ is a very mature game now, those of us who are are more or less experienced should be mindful that there are still people for whom this game is new, and that, if they 'grow up' having been exposed to nothing but standing in an open field killing mobs like a machine, and buying all their gear in EC or having it given to them, and then we complain that there are no good players coming up, we should accept that we are in part culpable for this situation.  You know, that tired old adage: 'Give a man a fish, they eat for a day, teach them to fish, they eat for a lifetime...'<br><br>Granted, 'teaching' (or as we do it, more like the blind leading the blind) can get tiresome, but every once in a while, the rewards are *so* worth it.  Our ranger, who played *very* fast and loose (read: lots of corpses) when we started grouping with her, is becoming a very skilled player, and loves her role; grouping with her is a pleasure now, and we're working on getting our Sebilis keys with her leading the way.  And, ye gods, we have humbling experiences almost every day.  Last night was a prime example, my getting squashed in TWO rounds in KC the other night on a single resisted mezz was another, entering a whole new world of strategy myself it seems... and with the highest level folks in our guild just now doing the Vox/Naggy zergling rush raids, and the Planes and everything else still ahead of us, I am sure we will get a lot more 'learning experiences' <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br><br>Bleh, I've rambled on enough.  Just try to remember, those of you with jaded eyes, that the world *is* new  for more folks out there than you might think, and before you hand out that bit of twink loot, or give some well meaning 'advice' on how to optimize themselves, if it might not be better to point them towards a dark hole in the ground and say 'Why don't we look in *there*...' <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br>Regards,<br>Nydia Ywalmoriel<br>Autonomous Collective<br>       <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uhalochanter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HaloChanter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local Resident</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/7/02 12:47:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=782.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ Evolution</span><hr size=1> Great post Nydia <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Halo 56th Beguiler<br>Sspeed 40th Monk<br>Halo 'who broke my mezz?'<br>Tank_001 says 'me'<br>Tank_001 has been slain by Haloface.<br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/utasar01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>tasar01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/7/02 1:25:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=782.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ Evolution</span><hr size=1>   Big time dungeon crawler here .

I started in July '99.  By that time, a couple guilds on Sol Ro had their first group of twinks working.  I ended up grouping pretty regularly with Avaran the clerc (Callie) and Jorash the paladin (he played an ogre warrior, forgot the name, its been a while) from Paradigm.  As I look back now, they were very twinked (Dragon and Guk loot)... and I think they were somewhat amused by the fact that I didn't realize it or care.  Anyways, in the bowels of Cazic-Thule, Unrest, and Mistmoore they taught me how to play the game - how to assist, when to cast my damage shield, when the druid needs to backup heal so he doesn't waste the clerics mana, what happens when the druid forgets to snare (heh!), what I can and cannot cast on mezzed mobs, what you want to make hotkeys for, how to manage aggro, root park - a million other things that I and other good players take for granted.<br><br>So I guess I lament the loss of these places... but it is true - there's more content in the game over 50 than under 50, and VI put in effective ways to get there, and I'd rather play my main in ToV than a twink in LGuk. <p><BR><br><B><I><img src="http://www.druidmail.com/santerre2.gif">Santerre.</I></B></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessage?topicID=778.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessage?topicID=764.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=782.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=782.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.threadControl?topicID=782.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=782.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=782.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Diplomacy Corner<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Administration Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6>NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
