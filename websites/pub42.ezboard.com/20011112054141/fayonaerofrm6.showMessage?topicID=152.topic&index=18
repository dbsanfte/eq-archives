excluding no drop, where it has to be someone who can use it, and will use it (but here can be lied too, of course), but that should be clear.<br>

about the warrior, well, if she admitted that she had a pair already and just wanted them for sale, they should have been lottoed with the whole group then. of course, somebody who has those intentions will never say this to the whole group. asshole. no more to say, i think. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uz0treth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Z0treth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(4/2/01 1:34:57 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmmmm</span><hr size=1> The whole need before greed concept is sorta bullshit.  There'd no way in hell that asking to random on something someone else can use is &quot;greedy&quot;.  Speaking as a caster and especially in kunark this whole idea of NB4G totally stupid.  I'd say a only about 5% of loot in kunark is caster gear.<br>
<br>
Here's a good example of why this system is not only bias but extrememly unfair to any non melee class.  Say you are camping the Necrosis/Guardian spawn in sebilis.  This spawn has absolutely NO loot for a caster class.  Say a CSS drops from the Necrosis.  NB4G the tank, ranger, rogue automatically gets the item, I'm screwed.  I can spend 10 hrs at this camp and not get a damn thing way of thinking.  If I random for this at least I have a chance to sell the item and get something I can use.  Most caster loot from Kunark is EXTREMELY expensive.  IF I want an ornate rune shield I pay 30k for it.  It would take me winning 2 CSS to even come close to affording that.<br>
<br>
Why do you see high lvl warriors running around with 200k in their bank and high lvl wizards having barely 5k in their bank?  The answer is NB4G.  I wholly expect to random any and all items that drop in a camp unless it has been specifically stated before hand.  I tend to see people change their tone when it's a camp that their loot drops and you'll see most melee prefer the NB4G, but when I'm playing my warrior or rogue I fully expect to have to random for anything my class can use.  A warrior can do just like I have to do, when he wins something he can't use he can go to the auction and get somethign he can use.<br>
<br>
This whole lame idea of being greedy if you are randoming on something you can't use is totally lame.  Every item in the game has a value at the auction, warriors don't deserve cobalt any more than I deserve a bonecasters robe.<br>
<br>
Anyone that believe they have any more right over an item than I do, should take a step back and realize who the real &quot;GREEDY&quot; person is. <p>Zotreth Beion'Dhevel<br>

<br>
Zotreth, if you don't have a chance at loot, why stay?  Why bother to continue working with people for 10 hours?  Is exp in that camp really worth it to you?  I realize you didn't have much choice pre-Velious, but you certainly do now.<br>
<br>
I can't dispute your claim of 5% caster loot in Kunark, but I don't think it's correct either.  I'll agree it's heavily favored to the melees.  Let's say your claim is true.  Why does it matter if you get loot?  There isn't much you can trade for anyway.<br>
<br>
I think you are being a bit misleading in asking why are there Warriors with 200k in the bank.  I could ask the same of Clerics, Enchanters, Rangers, Druids, Necros, Shaman, Paladins, Wizards, Mages, Bards, Rogues, and Monks.  I know members of every class with huges sums in the bank.  Unless you know the bank account total of every character in EQ, it's a bit of stretch to say one class usually has more cash than another.<br>
<br>
FWIW, I prefer NBG.  I realize it can be abused, but I still feel it's a better policy.  However, I am adaptable for the situation as long as it is stated up front. <p><B><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2 COLOR="#3A6EA5">Jzonn Stormwolf &lt;Final Destiny&gt;</B></FONT><BR>

A lot of people are really not talking about need before greed but outright greed-there's no reason why a warrior *needs* a second pair of cobalt boots.<br>
<br>
I'd like to pose a question though. Those of you who want to do full random, do you random spells if someone in the group *needs* it? I was in a group last night and we got a level 60 shaman spell. The shaman in the group was given it, no roll despite the fact that it had been clearly stated that all items would be randomed. Is a spell scroll not an item? Don't get me wrong, I'm happy that the shaman got a spell scroll he didn't have yet...but it kinda seems that the randoming everything street doesn't go both ways.<br>

I ask the group before something drops which loot system they use. If they say NBG and I don't feel like it I simply don't join.<br>
If I form a group I det the rules to open lotto. If you don't like it, well, you don't need to join. <br>
Ít was mentioned before. NEED before greed. If I see a Ranger with Epic I am sure he does not need a lupine dagger (Just an example)<br>
I think the most problems occure, because people only think about this, when something drops. And yes, I would roll with my cleric on an RBG.<br>

<br>
spells for casters are like equipment for tanks. you might not see it this way and flame me if you want but frankly gear just isnt important to casters. sure its nice to have but that extra 30 mana or whatever isnt gonna make you a better caster..but a new pet might<br>
<br>
for you to take away the cobalt bracer from the warrior because you wanna sell it for some nifty robe is just plain wrong. tanks have more loot that drops because they need loot more then casters.<br>
<br>
i also agree with how efal put it..if this game descends inot nothing but loot whoring..then why even play? is it fun for you? cuz its not fun for me like that. i dont group with people i dont wanna see get hooked up..pick up grps or not.<br>
