<br>
at rage...they didnt ks you..they would not have ksed you..but the fact of the matter is rage was up..they have clerics that need the mob and there is a chance you might fail. were they supposed to stay there and hold your hand or let you fail multiple attempts? yeah maybe it sucks but scions plays for scions..just like CN plays for CN..its not their objective to help vision get epics but they wont stoop to KSing no matter what. i KNOW this. i see it time and time again in the planes..some small guild is farming and CN/EW/DW/Scions whoever zonez in and all the noobs start whining about &quot;uberguild ksed my dragon!!&quot;<br>
<br>
get over it. this is a game..sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. any other game but EQ and scions could zone into solb..beat up vision and take ragefire. some of you whiners need to stfu and get a little more proactive with the game..its the way you get things done because whether you like it or not..SOMEBODY is gonna take the initiative if you dont..but i suppose you think cuz your 55 or 60 and pay your 10 bucks a month you DESERVE an epic<br>
<br>
EQ has become a little too PC for me ..bah<br>
<br>

<br>
(PS this is not a personal attack on Tolnik or anyone in Vision but simply a statement on the direction EQ has gone and why I think its starting to suck so bad and be so boring..competition and conflict are what makes things exciting..a pure utopian server would be VERY VERY boring..btw grats on your epic Tolnik) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/utolnik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tolnik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(4/18/01 6:11:00 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Scions of the Phoenix - Have they changed?</span><hr size=1> Elviscerator - we share slightly different views here.. I do agree that people should not whine - but I do not agree on the fact that since we all share the same server we should not be a little kind to one another.. unless it is the dark path you wish to choose.. if that is the case, with any dark intention it will be frowned upon by those of good ilk, and in my opinion be openly advertised.<br>
<br>
Nothing against you either or your guild - but Vision stands for helping other people and repecting peoples initiatives. If someone is camping a spawn we want - we let them have at it.. we do not breathe down thier necks - nor do we threaten to take the spawn from them if they fail.<br>
<br>
This may be a little to PC for yah but it is how we are and what we stand for. I feel that what you and you guild does reflects on your guilds character - period.<br>
<br>
If you want to be known as a KSing guild, or a guild that would take advantage of another guilds misfortunes, then hey go for it is what I say.. but bringing that to the server populations attention is not wining.. it is pure information being brought to the populace to so they can remain informed.<br>
<br>
People praise people for things that are good and inform people of shady doings.. that was all this was.. information use it as you will.<br>
<br>
Hey guys, thanks for the gratz.. I hope to wield my new res stick well and hope it helps many out on Aro.<br>

I read the whole thing &amp; don't see at any time that Scions rushed you or threatened to KS from you.  In fact you were told to take your time &amp; get buffed up to prepare for Ragefire.  We weren't even in the same room to avoid lag problems.  <br>
<br>
In fact the only person that said we were going to KS from you were your spies in the guild.  So let's talk about scruples here &amp; morals.  It's a very fine line - if any - between a traitor and a liar.  When you asked Scions members if we were going to KS from you the answer was &quot;no&quot;.  You simply jumped to conclusions from what your spies said.  We also had a cleric in there that'd been camping that room for a long time &amp; still had a necro in the room to watch for spawn while the cleric got a few hours of sleep.  Or did the traitor bother to tell you that?<br>
<br>
Btw, we're the same &quot;evil guild&quot; that rezed your guild at the Chardok King and let you loot the cleric item.   <p>Magna Maleficus <BR>

<br>
The past is the past - Phoenix was a great guild at one time.. and yes they had gone outa their way in the past..<br>
<br>
But these are logged observations I am making now in the present.<br>
<br>
Give what excuses you may.. admitted by your own members mouths is what this log displays.. I am just bringing it to light for others to view.<br>
<br>
Evil is not what is being examined here - guild direction and its members intentions are.<br>
<br>
- in regards to the camp comment -<br>
<br>
And btw no one was in the room when I started camping it... the necro came in long after we had cleared the FG's and said he would not contest the spawn.. I have that logged as well.<br>
<br>
So in fact your cleric was not in that room on this particular occasion.<br>
<br>
I acquired the room right after Looking Glass' cleric had to camp for personal reasons.<br>
<br>
But you are probably right because you were up with me and the other vision members there in that room from 3:30am that morning till 1pm when he spawned huh ;P<br>

<br>
And then we were intentionally trained by one of your party members, that will remain nameless by me, promptly thereafter.. (although we can understand the frustration that was uncalled for)<br>
<br>
If you were still on after that you would find out that Membrayne - the mage that looted the staff has volenteered to help on friday get another for those that feel they were wronged.. I assume that to be you Afierra.<br>
<br>
We killed a mob that was pulled to us - not intentionally stolen(if it was truely pre-engaged to begin with).. and we offered to help recipricate the loot lost at next spawn. /shrug not intentional and we offer to help the offended parties get another.. we ARE bad.<br>
