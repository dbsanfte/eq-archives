<br>
The Neriak Sigil<br>
--Edition No. 2--<br>
<br>
-Mayhem in Qeynos-<br>
In Qeynos, Antonius Bayle officially dismantled rumors of war approaching Qeynos. He ordered everyone to remain calm. Disgusted with this situation, King Naythox Thex made the following statement:<br>
&quot;Fellow Teir'Dal, Antonius Bayle has once again exhibited how weak humans can truly be. He chooses to run from war instead of facing it head-on. The Teir'Dal Nation shall never fear war. Fight! Fight, I say! Destroy one's enemies and be gone with them.<br>
Always be prepared for war. Never let the enemy see fear in your eyes.<br>
Each day, the Threefold Plague of Bertoxxulous destroys crop in the Karanas. The Qeynos government chooses to ignore warnings of the food shortage currently being experienced. Foolish humans, let them parish. Their merchants beg for mercy and are forced to ask help of the rest of the world. It is my rule that the citizens of Neriak shall only assist fellow Teir'Dal and those friendly to our cause.<br>
No Teir'Dal wishing to remain amongst the living, shall help the foolish citizens of Qeynos.<br>
Let them wither away and die!<br>
Our King has spoken!<br>
<br>
-Child of Hate-<br>
There has been no update on the actions of Lanys T'Vyl. Things have been eerily quiet. The King ruled that any information being withheld from his majesty shall be dealt with immediately by death.<br>
As ordered by the King, Dorvias N'Keth continues with the preparations for the sacrificial ceremony.<br>
<br>
-High Elven Princess-<br>
Reports have been flooding in from our secret offices on Faydwer. It appears that Firiona Vie has obtained the sacred stones that she needed for performing a ritual to summon the Avatar of Tunare. Our spies continue to monitor the situation. It has been rumored that those who oppose the high elven society may play a key part in the future.<br>
<br>
<br>
So ends the latest Neriak Signal.<br>

 Firiona Vie leads the charge into battle against Cazic-Thule on Tholuxe-Paells<br>
Chyr [5/31/2001-7:26:19 PM]  Comments[5] <br>
<br>
It was a quiet day in the woods; I had just returned from Kaladim when Firiona Vie shouted that she required all able bodied Soldiers of Tunare to assist her in Lesser Faydark. She said, with the power of the four stones, she was going to summon The Mother of All, Tunare.<br>
<br>
After assembling, she revealed to us that we needed to find the magical unicorn named Equestrielle--only she could reveal how to summon The Mother of All.<br>
<br>
After finding Equestrielle, we were guided to the Faerie Ring, the only place in the forest with enough connection left to The Plane of Growth to summon Tunare. After naming four adventurers of Norrath as her chosen, the summoning began. The Fire Caller, Wind Caller, Earth Keeper, and Wave Caller were all given respective stones and with their combined power, Tunare was summoned.<br>
<br>
Firiona Vie immediately apologized for failing in her task; The Mother of All was quick to forgive. Apparently, Firiona's stave has been corrupted by Cazic-Thule to such an extent that even Tunare herself could not find the stave, nor alter it's corrupted state.<br>
<br>
The Mother of All charged Firiona Vie with revisiting The Ring of Scale. She promised, however, that this time, her memories would not be reaved. <br>
<br>
After prefacing that The Ring of Scale had become aloof from the adventuring world and was very hostile to those who attmepted to enter it's dens, Tunare made cryptic remarks about an agent of The Ring of Scale and what would be needed for a peaceful encounter.<br>
<br>
Peace was not long lived in this forest: Danger was sensed. Cazic-Thule had made his presence known and was slowly making his way towards the Faerie Village. Tunare bid everyone to flee, but Firiona Vie refused to go and vowed to stay and fight. Nearly 130 supporters of Tunare and Firiona Vie agreed to stay and fight along side.<br>
<br>
Many threats were made by The Faceless One. He came from nowhere and immediately the dark forest was alight with fireworks--displays of magick from some of Norrath's most talented wielders. Many suffered death at the hands of Cazic-Thule who dealt damage at a massive rate of 16,000 per spell at times. However, the day was not ordained to succumb to evil. Cazic-Thule was defeated and Firiona Vie was Champion of the day.<br>
<br>
The greatest hurt was made to Equestrielle, whose magical horn had been corrupted during the battle with Cazic-Thule. Firiona Vie was forced, crying as she did it, to cut off Equestriell's horn with her astonishingly beautiful magic blade. Equestrielle ran off and disappeared not to be seen again.<br>
<br>
The huge crowd, overcome with zealotry, huddled close to Firiona Vie. Understandably, Firiona Vie was quite shaken with the day's events and wanted nothing more than some time alone. The crowd was unforgiving in their enthusiasm, sadly. She left suddenly in an enraged state, but not handing out a few tokens of reward--coins that were to be given to a Lord in Felwithe. The rewards for these coins is not known to me. <br>
<br>
Immediately after Firiona Vie left, the sky turned crimson red and there were defeaning screams heard. A horde of undead sprites appeared that looked similar to the guardians of The Temple of Solusek Ro. Cazic-Thule's voice was heard after he was slain and he promised that he would meet Tunare's Champion again, very soon. Perhaps this was an example of how strong Cazic-Thule's hold over the forests of Lesser Faydark really are.<br>
<br>
This Enchanter quickly left the scene after the undead sprites appeared and I know not what happened afterward. It was quite a day in Lesser Faydark, one that shall be talked about for a long time to come...<br>

&quot;Rumors of War Unfounded&quot;</center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Antonius Bayle issued a statement recently saying that the widespread rumors of war due to the plague unleashed on the Plains of Karana are unfounded. &quot;Though we believe we know the identity of the perpetrators of this terrible crime I must urge all citizens to exercise calm. We are civilized people ruled by law. Thus we must follow the rule of law and not allow ourselves to resort to vigilante justice.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vegalys Keldrane told The Times that the matter was still under investigation. He assured us that the perpetrators would be brought to justice. He too urged citizens to remain calm.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><center> &quot;Food Shortages Cause Merchants Concern&quot;</center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
<br>
A poor harvest and damaged crops are leaving some merchants short on certain baked goods. Karn Tassen, local merchant, had this to say about the food shortage.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is hard enough to scrape by and make enough money to pay your taxes in this town. Now with this blasted plague effecting everthing, I'm starting to run out of stock. It's a mess I tell you!&quot;<br>
<br>
A call has gone out to independent bakers to assist our local merchants and those abroad in keeping their supplies properly stocked. Anyone interested in assisting the community in this time of need should inquire of local members of the Merchants of Qeynos. Those traveling abroad are urged to contact members of the Coalition of Tradefolk. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><center> -= Freeport Observer =-<br>

&quot;Hand of Bertoxxulous Reaches Across of Norrath&quot;</center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
The plague unleashed across the Karana plains by the Bloodsabres several weeks past has finally reached its venomous hand to our portside city. Provisions have been growing steadily scarce due to the lack of necessary materials to make bread, muffins, and other goods needed by the citizens and travelers alike.<br>
<br>
One of our prospering merchants, Innkeep Huntor, has expressed his concern with this shortage of certain products. &quot;Although we still have plenty of rations, the production of our most fine of goods has been harmed due to the plague upon the Karana fields. We have fear that the demand for these foods shall grow greatly, but our supply will only decrease to an eventual and severe lack in these goods.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><center> &quot;Runnyeye Citadel Reclaimed&quot;</center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
We have heard rumors from our merchants and tradesmen who frequent the Highpass area, that the goblin miners of Runnyeye citadel have overthrown the Evil Eyes that have enslaved them for several years. The goblins have retaken the citadel as their own, and appointed a new leader with the execution of their former king, who was beneath the Evil Eye's control.<br>
<br>
There is little direct meaning of this event to the citizens of Freeport beyond the possibility of a compromised safety for the merchants who frequent Highpass Keep, as the Pickclaw clan of goblins remain there as members of a free civilization. We merely look back upon the history that led the corruption of Kithicor Wood and the influence the goblins had in that massacre.<br>

The upheaval in Runnyeye Citadel has caused a great deal of panic amongst the citizens of Rivervale. Clan Pickclaw battled its way through the dwellings defeating the inhabitants, the evil eyes and goblin slaves of Xorbb.<br>

Lord Pickclaw personally personally executed the Goblin King and his minions, and integrated the remaining Runnyeye goblins into his clan. While most were slain in battle, including Borxx, the remaining evil eyes fell back to the Gorge of King Xorbb.<br>
<br>
After tghe battle was won, Lord Pickclaw struck a deal with a strange subterranean race of fungal beings called the Sporali. The Sporali would do mining work for the goblins, and in return, the goblins wouldn't wipe them out.<br>
<br>
Apparently, Lord Pickclaw and his followers had been hidden away for several years building up forces.<br>

Hobie Mullins deemed himself an ambassador of baking. While trying to improve the quality of life amongst the ogres and trolls of the swampy land of Innothule, Hobie was eaten by a ferocious ogre reporter of Da Swamp News after he gave the beast the recipe for Muskie Marinade and some journalistic advice.<br>
<br>
In memory of Hobie, we have included the recipe that he was trying to share to the world.<br>
<br>
Ingredients: Rathe Muskie, Vinegar, Spices, Snake Egg Oil, Fish Wine<br>
<br>
Create the marinade by mixing the liquid ingredients. Allow the Muskie to marinade for several hours. Add spices and cook until skin is golden brown and meat appears lightly translucent.<br>

Several days past, our princess and divine Champion, Firiona Vie, amde a plea to our High Priest of Tunare for the creation of the four sacred stones of nature. The elves of Tunare have had little need for there stones since our migration from Tunaria, but The Priests of Tunare have kept such rituals sacred and within the archives of documented rituals.<br>
<br>
Abiding most graciously to Firiona's request, Yeolam Bronzeleaf set immediately to work on the four-day ritual that would produce the stones requested. The days have passed and the stones have been completed. Now we wait patiently and with the greatest of hope that Tunare's Champion shall be successful in her need for these sacred stones.<br>

The people of Qeynos have cried out for blood and the rumors of war have glided through the Karana air as a bitter, screeching horn played by the inept.<br>
<br>
Antonious Bayle IV, ruler of Qeynos and the Karana Plains, has called for an immediate silence to the painful rumors of blood and battle.<br>
<br>
The young, zealous ruler demanded that all remain in peace and that he will do all within his power to see that war does not come to his kingdom so long as he remains upon the throne. The people have since given to their sovereign's just rule and returned to their daily routines.<br>

In an effort to bring you news both above and below the surface of Norrath, we have recieved a report of a quiet war that broke out between the goblins known as the &quot;Pickclaws&quot; and those of &quot;Clan Runnyeye&quot;. A goblin calling himself Lord Pickclaw apparently lead the rebellion.<br>
<br>
The Runnyeye clan and the Pickclaws split when a monsterous Evil Eye by the name of Xorbb used his terrible powers of the mind to enslave, coerce and otherwise much around with the goblins, eventually taking over Runnyeye Citadel. Many escaped during this time and relocated under the Serpent Spine mountains. They have been a thorn in the side of the humans of High Keep ever since. They called themselves the Pickclaws due to their interests in mining.<br>
<br>
Lord Pickclaw and his army rolled easily over the goblins of Runnyeye Citadel and he personally executred the former Goblin King and even, it is said, the Evil Eye known as Borxx. It was also reported that this &quot;Lord Pickclaw&quot; struck a deal with a race of fungus creatures called the sporali, whereby Lord Pickclaw would agree not to kill them in return for their mining ore for him.<br>

Yeolam Bronzeleaf, Priest of Tunare, has reported that he has completed the creation of the stones required by princess Firiona Vie. The stones will be used in a ritual whereby the princess will attempt to summon the power of Tunare to seek guidance for the recovery of the artifact staff, known as The Lifeguide, that was given to her by The Mother of All. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/usythevicious.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sythevicious</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/2/01 5:15:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=91.topic&index=88>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Journal found on the docks in Qeynos!</span><hr size=1> MicNasty of Arcane Blade found a journal on the docks in Qeynos.

<br>
After many months away, the beautiful Firiona Vie is finally returning to Felwithe.<br>
<br>
In the months after her rescue, she has spent a great deal of time resting and attending celebrations here at the outpost.<br>
<br>
News of her rescue has brought great joy to the outpost and will bring even greater joy to the city.<br>
<br>
Because of the many threats on the princess's life, I have sent several messangers to you. Each will deliver to you a journal. Only one will bring you the correct journal on the escort plans. You will reward each of these messangers in such a manner so they that shall not know which of them contains the true plans.<br>
<br>
Once you decipher the correct plans, you must prepare the city for the arrival.  The Koada'Vie should be on highest alert.<br>

I trust you will have everything in place before we arrive.<br>

UPDATE: MicNasty gave the book to Idwar and Pheidippidies teleported him to Kelethin to give the book to Capt. Silverwind.  He was very excited, said he would send news to General Jyleel in Felwithe.  Gave Idar some gold, and said to spread the word of happiness soon to return.<br>

<br>
Besides the fact we really had these very special attacks from the named Spectres in Oasis, we immediately afterwards had the sighting of Tunare in Greater Faydark.<br>
<br>
Lets first talk about the Spectres.<br>
This event was without doubt a special happening and was in no way a rumor or an assumption. Still we have not the slightest explenation for their part in the whole story. <br>
The Spectres didn't dro panything of interest nor did they talk in any way. We will try to find out more details about this.<br>
<br>
Now the point of interest, Tunare.<br>
Immediately after the Spectres were slain, I got told that *Tunare is in Greater Faydark*.<br>
Due to very good services of the volunteers (thanks MInka and Sachmet) I reached the Faydark around 1 minute after the call. <br>
I found the Wizard spires completely covered up with people. There were already around 100 persons in the Zone. <br>
From this moment on I tried to find out what is going on. Tunare was NOT there as I arrived. Dozens of people kept shouting that Tunare will fight Cazic and that the War has begun and so on. <br>
Within around 10 minutes I had around 400 fighters ready and in position. Gfay was secured, Qeynos army was up, scouts all around Norrath. Everyone was waiting for my orders. <br>
I would like to add that I personally did NOT order a call to arms.<br>
However, I was shouting for informations and tried to trigger down the person who actually started this all. All I have found out so far is the fact that I heared about this all from a 4th party and not the scout personally. Therefore I believe that during the message was spread, some things may have been misunderstood or even the scout himself misunderstood some things. Till now I have NOT been able to really talk with the scout about what actually happened. <br>
As far as I can tell, noone really has seen Tunare.<br>
It would  have been very surprising to see Tunare show in Gfay since we are expecting Firiona Vie to SUMMON Her Mother in Lfay as the next step and we are not expecting Tunare herself to appear out of nothing. Still this could have been the beginning of the war simple because it wouldhave been something special. <br>
<br>
The huge responds we got, the extremely fast reactions of all helpers and the very very good communication we have within the council and single volunteers brought the impressive amount of 250 people to the Greater Faydark within around 15 minutes. <br>
Unfortunately /ooc this all was way too much for Verant. The zone crashed to me personally 5 times in a row. It took me 25 minutes to get from the spires to the Lesser Faydark to just be able to logg in again normally. After 5 minutes there I saw 2 Guides in Greater Faydark and so I thought the yone is back up and I may be ale to talk to one of them. This turned out as a big mistake as it took me 4 attemps and 15 minutes to simply turn around at the yone and yone back to Lfay again.<br>
This situation is VERY concerning since I personally expect AT LEAST the same amount of people in the Greater Faydark once the War really is happening. Please Verant, fix this before it all happens. Even just the Summoning of TUnare will result in the same amount of people in Lesser Faydark. <br>
Ayonae Ro is ready and very very sensitive about any happenings right now. Especially since they simply DO NOT HAPPEN. Yes I am a bit frustrated at this moment that no GM and No guide so far has shown any interest or effort about our Army and Council. Not even the Events that happened everywhere else (where they mostly are less organised than we are) did happen with us...<br>
GMs contact persons on other servers and really help to make this all a great Roleplay Story, with us, noone knows about anything and noone cares. This is a pity since this game is all about Roleplay and once the Players manage to have the biggest Alliance and show the biggest Effort ever on this server, noone seems to care.<br>
/ooc off<br>
<br>
So after around 2 hours of confusion and zones going down I officially called this all an end. Even if I didn't actually call to arms, I thought it's my duty to at least call it to an end. A GM had confirmed (not to me thou) that this all was a hoax. Nothing was planned, nothing happened. <br>
<br>
I would now like to apologize to everyone that may have left a raid, has left his/her group, that got forced out of daily business and that suffered dozens of LDs and zonecrashes due to this. <br>
It was not my intention to do so.<br>
<br>
Besides this, the response time and the time it took to set up all armies was VERY IMPRESSIVE! <br>
It made me very proud to see such an effort and such a good organisation. <br>
I have a very good feeling now for once when the war starts.<br>
I can just hope and pray to Erollisi that you all are not frustrated because of this false alert and will still join at the real call to arms.<br>
<br>
Again, please accept my apologies and keep up the good work.<br>
<br>

But anyways Taino it IS great to see how fast this group can get moving, even with Verant turning up their noses at us.

G Fay (or any zone for that matter) cannot support over 250 toons at the same time... so, should we have people ported to Steamfont, and BB and have them stay near the zone lines when the call to arms comes untill we get organized and ready to fight. With 100 people in each of the adjacent zones there would be less of a chance of crashing and creating more confusion and stress.  <br>

Taino and Arquinval I was very happy with you when i realized that your efforts have been rewarded - you could attend in a very special way and in my humble opinion it deserved to you.<br>
<br>
For making any further comment i should ...<br>
<br>
/ooc start<br>
<br>
I am appaled at many details of this event and scenario.<br>
<br>
Obviously Verant is not able to prepare the event technically as well as they work on all matters concerning the registration of the game.  Exactly 24 hours previous to the scenario in Lesser Faydark we misleadingly have been alarmed that the ceremony would take place in GFay. About 230 people gathered and the zone started to crash and most of us went LD.<br>
Verant was not able to take care for the situation and about 2 hours after the alarm they tried to manage like boucers do - acting rudely and arbitrarily:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
[Sun Jun 03 03:45:15 2001] GM Aerendar - There is no GM Event occuring today in the Greater Faydark area. Please depart the zone if you are not fighting here or have no business here so others can continue with their business.<br>
<br>
[Sun Jun 03 03:48:18 2001] Aerendar says out of character, 'GM Aerendar here. Please do not continue with the ooc's and shouts about a GM Event here. There will be no GM Event today on Ayonae Roe. Please continue on with your business.'<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Verant has had the opportunity to preview what would happen. All in all only precaution visible to me was letting happen the scenario in LF as they did on the other servers.<br>
<br>
If I was Verant I would have been prepared better. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Unnecessary to mention they ignored any faction details. The scenario took place right in the fairy village. After killing 3 of them I casted a pet just no tobe bothered any longer.<br>
<br>
All in all I wasn't able to do anything when CT showed up. I went LD a couple of times and it took about 15 minutes each time till the message saying there is another character of mine online vanished finally.<br>
<br>
But ... <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> most annoying</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have been the people in the zone. Use- and needless shoutings and oocs ruined any feelings that could have come up. Rude speech and behaviour seemed bothered all of us and even multiple requests to back off so that on one hand all people could see more and on the other hand the leading actors of the drama had more space to act have been ignored. Everyone tried to stand in the front row and even some of them realized the best place would be right between Fiorina Vie and her Callers. It was disgusting! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
I wonder why so many children in the age range of 8 to 15 have access to their father's credit card.<br>
<br>
It was a most disappointing situation specially for those who tried to organize players actions 'against all odds' or at least against voices who argued that the event would end in pure chaos when trying to convince people to attend. Alas, those voices seemingly have spoken the truth.<br>
<br>
