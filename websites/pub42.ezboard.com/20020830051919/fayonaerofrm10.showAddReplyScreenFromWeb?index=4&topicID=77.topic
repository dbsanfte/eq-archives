<br>
Something awful has happened. It is time for High Elves one and all to bow their heads in unison and speak a prayer to the Mother of All... our home is in danger. Recently, our dear Princess and Champion Firiona Vie made contact with Tunare in Lesser Faydark. By her side were citizens of Kelethin and the Unicorn Equestrielle, friend of Firiona and a symbol of all that is pure and natural. Upon the Mother's appearance, tradegy struck.<br>
<br>
Leaves withered and fell and the air grew rank for Cazic-Thule awaited them in ambush. It is not for mortals to say what power possesses the Faceless, but the greatest powers of balance could not stop what was to come. If you have been out to Lesser Faydark since then, I do not need to describe to you what has happened. If you have not been... I cannot, words alone cannot, describe to you the state of the forest.<br>
<br>
Worst of all, her horn as the focus, Equestrielle was the target of the hate. In order to save from losing her completely, our brave champion had to do the unthinkable. In order to stem the corruption in the proud unicorn, Firiona Vie was forced to sever the horn from atop Equestrielle's head. Please take a moment and say your own prayers to Tunare for Equestrielle's redemption.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><center>  Lanys T'Vyl's Whereabouts Still Unknown</center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
For all of our safety, the royal guards of Felwithe, with the cooperation of the Paladins of Tunare, do their best to keep watch on the fallen child of hate. However, she has managed to slip beneath their notice for the time being and that can not be good. What she is seeking we do not know, but let this serve as a warning to all of Felwithe to be at its sharpest, for whatever she is up to will certainly involve the High Elves in some way. To do your part, see Talisyn Stormwing in the Faydark. Remember, the safety of the Kingdom is everyone's responsibility. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/unamyrawhisperwind.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Namyra Whisperwind</A> at: 6/29/01 12:47:25 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/unamyrawhisperwind.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Namyra Whisperwind</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/29/01 12:46:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=77.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Tinker's News and World Report Vol. 3</span><hr size=1> Tinker's News and World Report<br>

Qeynos Fights Back<br>
-----------------------------</center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
Antonius Bayle and the ruling council of Qeynos have begun formal investigations into a shadowy group calling themselves the Bloodsabers. Worshippers of Bertoxxulous, this group is responsible for a failed coup attempt some time ago in the past as well as for recently releasing the terrible plague upon the Plains of Karana.<br>
<br>
The local Magistrate and advisor to the Qeynos ruler plans to employ an army of investigators to root out and bring an end to this terrible threat to their city. He expects many arrests in the coming days as lower ranking members of this strange cult are collared and hauled in for questioning.<br>
<br>
We here at TNWR support Antonius Bayle in his efforts to bring an end to this threat. His Magistrate and Advisor, Vegalys Keldrane, has asked any interested in assisting with these investigations to contact him personally for further instructions.<br>

<br>
The forsaken child of Innoruuk has yet to be apprehended by the Teir'Dal or their allied nations while the renegade and vengeful god-born child continues her search for Malevolence. Already possessing the first piece of the powerful and most feared artifact, the child is believed to have gained considerable knowledge as to the location of the Arm of Malevolence, or the staff of the artifact.<br>
<br>
We have gained rumors that the Crimson Triad, a group of three influential and powerful Teir'Dal men appointed by Innoruuk himself, had sent Dorvias N'Keth, the second in command of the Triad, to the plains of Kunark. In the Overthere plains, Dorvias was believed to have gained some information relating to the staff's possible whereabouts held tightly by the clutches of the Ring of Scale. Though the location has yet to be proven as undisputed and absolute fact, we do give a gentle prayer of relief that perhaps the artifact shall forever remain out of the grip of both Lanys and any other who would seek such awesome and destructive power. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=loriel>Loriel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/29/01 2:30:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=77.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Neriak Signal, Edition 3</span><hr size=1> -Child Of Hate-<br>
Dorvias N'Keth, the archpriest of Innoruuk and advisor to King Naythox Thex, discovered that Lanys T'Vyl, the forsaken daughter of Innoruuk, has learned the location of the arm of malevolence, the second of the three lost pieces of the artifact that could destroy our father and give her the ultimate power.<br>
In order to keep Lanys T'Vyl from obtaining the part of the artifact, the Archpriest obtained permission from Venril Sathir to seek out the Iksar, Danak Dhorentath to raise the long since dead General Tzashk, keeper of this staff for several years.<br>
Once the general was summoned, the location of the staff was made known. Tzashk informed them that only the great dragon Trakanon would know the true location of the staff for it was he who defeated him and his fleet and confiscated the staff from him long ago.<br>
Dorvias N'Keth was last reported as heading to confront the Ring of Scale about this information.<br>
<br>
-High Elven Princess-<br>
After summoning the avatar of Tunare, Firiona Vie and her devoted Mother of All were surprised by a visit from the Faceless. Yes, the avatar of Cazic-Thule appeared and banished the floating goddess from Norrath.<br>
The evil presence of the God of Fear still remains in the lesser portion of the Faydark Forest. While it is not the presence of our hateful father Innoruuk, the corruption should still amuse the Teir'Dal nation as the scent of fear amongst the high elfs and woodlanders can be smelt from afar.<br>
<br>
-The Wizard Al'Kabor-<br>
The recent outcome of Al'Kabor's research has been new translocation spells, but that is not the most interesting part of this report. Apparently, one of his assistants betrayed him and he retaliated by stripping the individual of his wizardry.<br>
While others view him as being a dangerous wizard, we should not fear him. His mercifulness proves that he is no threat to us.<br>

____________________________________________<br>
<br>
There are several very special notes in those Newspapers. THey don't only reflect things we already known.. they bring new inputs:<br>
<br>
Antonican Times:<br>
- Vegalys Keldrane asks the people of Norrath to contact him to help against the Bloodsabres. In fact, he is giving out a Quest. we should investigate this further!<br>
After all, its finally someone that DOES something against the plague, so lets help them!<br>
<br>
<br>
-= The Rivervale Voice =-<br>
- Same as before, Rivervale is standing behind Qeynos.<br>
&quot;Expecting a large number of arrests in the upcoming weeks, Vegalys Keldrane has asked that any loyal to Qeynos to contact him personally to apply for the position to official investigator.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-= The Freeport Observer =-<br>
- &quot;Finally we learn the truth behind the inaction - they simply could not handle the problem. <br>
The whole letter is written by the Milita and controlled by the milita. Strange enough that it is sold in North Freeport and having SUCH words in it. &quot;<br>
The Militia, Lucan D'Lere obvfiously is amused about the recent happenings in Qeynos. And now that Qeynos finally starts fighting against the plague, he tries to again use this against them and convince the Freeport Citizens to believe in the Milita.<br>
- &quot;Your guess is as good as mine, but rumors say that a former gnomish apprentice of his has acquired some of his work. Keep your eyes here for more details as they surface. &quot;<br>
As he states, find the Gnome.<br>
<br>
<br>
-= The Royal Herald =-<br>
- They surprisingly do not mention Qeynos at all. Just a sidenote...<br>
- This Newspaper actually barely really has information in it but a name...<br>
&quot;To do your part, see Talisyn Stormwing in the Faydark. Remember, the safety of the Kingdom is everyone's responsibility. &quot;<br>
What does he want us to do? We should find Talisyn Stormwing and see what he has to tell us.<br>
<br>
<br>
-= Tinker's News and World Report =-<br>
- &quot;We here at TNWR support Antonius Bayle in his efforts to bring an end to this threat. &quot; <br>
Gnomes help now? They are suddenly on the good side? Weren't they always a little... lets say.. suspicious?<br>
<br>
<br>
-= The Odus Chronicle Vol. 3 =-<br>
- Also Erudin, closest City from Qeynos, does NOT mention the Plague and the Actions in Qeynos with any word. THis is very strange to me. They just talk about Lanys...<br>
- The information about the Malevolence's Staff's location is in no way as detailed as in the Neriaks News. But also, they use different names and a different story.... different people, other than Lanys, try to find the staff.<br>
<br>
<br>
-= The Neriak Signal, Edition 3 =-<br>
- &quot;the three lost pieces of the artifact that could destroy our father and give her the ultimate power.&quot;<br>
Here we go. We thought about how strong Lanys may be with the Staff. Now we know it. She would be a huge danger to her father! So Innoruuk has to care about this.<br>
- &quot;Once the general was summoned, the location of the staff was made known. Tzashk informed them that only the great dragon Trakanon would know the true location of the staff &quot;<br>
Lets go talk to Trakanon. Thats a very good hint. Lets see what we can find about this. What was the relation between Lanys and Trakanon? Not a good one I think...<br>
- &quot; the corruption should still amuse the Teir'Dal nation as the scent of fear amongst the high elfs and woodlanders can be smelt from afar.&quot;<br>
