What's not good is when there are several threads on similar topics, or worse teh exact same topic.<br>

This thread is for general statements about the boundaries of FFA / CampSteal / et cetera as such. Just like ThePerfectFlaw, I appreciate if the general bickering can contain itself to that other thread. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

<br>
First come first serve?  It works out really well to be honest with small camps and groups.  Things with a roughly 30 minute respawn rate.  However, those that usually "came first" are prepared.<br>
<br>
I guess it's sorta like the old Zordak fights.  Who has the right to the kill?  The cleric that has the weekend off and has been sitting there for two days, but doesn't have sufficient forces to kill him, or the cleric who showed up 2 hours ago when he got home from work with an army at his back?<br>
<br>
To be honest, due to recent events in the world of EQ, my opinion on this is heavily influenced.<br>
<br>
Verant has stated that nobody can 'claim' a camp.  If a mob is up, the first to pull wins.  They also ask out of common courtesy that if someone is camping something, you leave it alone.  <br>
<br>
It really honestly can't be fully dictated, since both are in the right.  Cleric A has been sitting there, but it's not his fault he has a lot of free time on his hand.  By the same measure, Cleric B has the numbers, it isn't his fault he has more friends at that time of day.<br>
<br>
It all comes down then to past occurences.  If Cleric A and B are old chums, one might back down for the other.  If they aren't however, shit may just hit the fan.<br>
<br>
<br>
Kill Stealing?  Whomever makes the first aggressive action other then proximity agro has the rights to the kill.<br>
<br>
Raid Stealing?  If there's one intended target, then it's a first pull first win situation.  Hence infamous "racing to targets" and all the bad blood that comes out of that.<br>
<br>
Camp stealing?  If you can hold the camp, kudos to you.  But if you don't have the class/numbers, or aren't pulling specific mobs, those that aren't being killed are up for grabs. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=35824><img src=http://www.theperfectflaw.com/picture/brain.gif></a><br>

<br>
We were levels 56-60 mostly, and mostly /roleplay.  I'm not even sure how you came to a &quot;mostly 52-56&quot; figure... since out of the 17 of us present, only about 3 were not /roleplay (3 or so is not most when your total is 17).<br>
<br>
&quot;We perceived this much like a Trakanon or Lozidal raid. Whoever gets enough people to start clearing to Juggs with a magician in tow generally &quot;has the camp&quot; at Trakanon.&quot;<br>
<br>
But you did not do this this time... since we had 15+ and growing in the zone while you had only 3 and growing.  We were there first, you could plainly and easily see it.  Obviously, we were already &quot;clearing the way to Juggs&quot; while the rest (our mana in this situation) became present.  Why would you say that you perceive it like something, then not act on it as such?<br>
<br>
&quot;We figured, as long as their puller wasn't out swimming with Kalorek`Dar, and if we got ready first, he was as much ours to pull as anyone's.&quot;<br>
<br>
This contridicts your above statement.  Which is it?  Do you feel that the first to the scene has the right?  Or first to pull has the right?  Because you just stated both.  First you say the first to the scene is obviously clearing Juggs and has the right, then you go a different direction and say that racing to the mob is the right way.<br>
<br>
&quot;In the end, we got a few &quot;thanks for trampling over us&quot; messages; at which we offered to share or possibly even back down next time if they wanted to communicate with us. I suppose since Kalorek`Dar takes such a small number of people to kill, it might not have been obvious that we were moving in on it too, but I'll ask anyway.&quot;<br>
<br>
No... we didn't think you were moving in on him since there was only a hand full of you there when we were set and buffed, and just waiting on mana at that point.  Also, we let our guard down when we saw it was &quot;Vision&quot; as well and didn't rush to beat you to said target.  You only had a few people there, and in light of our joining of forces in Fear (for the broken golem) a short while back... we didn't think we'd have anything to fear from you, as in a made rush to beat each other to a target.  We figured you saw our force already there, and would have respectfully left it at that.  Didn't expect we'd have to race you at all... thinking you would have done exactly what we would have done in that situation, and left.<br>
<br>
Actually... we already had done that once to that very same mob that night before we started rallying forces.  Exiled Alliance tried him out with a very small force and failed.  Guild chat from our trackers was saying we should rally and get there before Exiled reformed and tried again.  I told them all to leave it alone, since Exiled was there already and was most likely going to give it another shot.  I would hate to have someone come in and take him from us while we were trying him... so I would never do it to another.... so everyone listened to me and didn't gather, leaving the dragon to XA.  I didn't want to take the mob from XA since there were there trying him at that moment, and we were not.<br>
<br>
Guild chat started up again about 10 minutes later saying that the Exiled Alliance people had left, and it didn't look like they were waiting around for more to come help them, nor attempting the fight again themselves.  That's when we mobilized.  No ones feet were there to step on anymore, so all was good to move in.  We ported in, began forming groups and buffing.  I noticed 3 Vision in the zone, but didn't even think twice about it and didn't worry at all since, like I said, I didn't think you'd race us to the spawn after seeing our larger force already present.  A mistake that won't happen again.<br>
<br>
14 of you total had piled in and pulled him almost immediately upon arriving while we were sitting there waiting for those blue bars to hit 100% again.  14 total when I did a &quot;/who Vision&quot; after hearing the answer &quot;we did&quot; to the question &quot;Who just killed Klor?&quot; anyway.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying that you commited a crime... EQ rules of engagement state that who ever engages first gets said mob, no camps, etc etc.  Not saying you were wrong... but rude?  Yes.<br>
<br>
&quot;at which we offered to share or possibly even back down next time if they wanted to communicate with us.&quot;<br>
<br>
Communication is a TWO way street.  Who are YOU that WE have to communicate with YOU for communication to start?  We were there first, you could plainly see this, YOU should have communicated with US.  NOT the other way around.  If you were there first in force, then we would have either asked you if you were hitting him or we would have left the zone without even asking.  What's this about you coming into a zone, and if people don't communicate with YOU, you're just going to take the mob because they must not be after it?  You are not our masters, you are not our peers, we do not answer to you.  Respect goes both ways.... and I, as well as our whole guild, had respect for Vision.  You, unfortunatly don't have respect for us, as you did NOT open the line of communication to the force that was there first (us).<br>
<br>
This line right here:<br>
<br>
&quot;at which we offered to share or possibly even back down next time if they wanted to communicate with us. &quot;<br>
<br>
That's the only line that pisses me off.  You got to the target first because we let down our guard and didn't think we had to worry about racing you.  I could care less about the target at this point though.  That's not the issue anymore as far as I'm concerned.  It's the lack of respect towards us that this line above shows that has me pissed.  Just because you entered the zone doesn't mean that we have to start sending you tells.  You are not our masters.  Your people are not better than our people, your people are not &quot;above&quot; our people, you do not hold some sort of higher &quot;rank&quot; that we must salute, you are not &quot;worth&quot; more, you are not &quot;worth&quot; less... you are another group of adventurers on this server, just like us.  You entering the zone does not mean that we have to quickly bow down and open communication, like you're &quot;above&quot; opening it with us or something.  Superior attitudes really piss me off.  We were in force first and medding up to pull, we should not have to drop everything to start a line of communication with you, when you should have opened it with us first.<br>
<br>
By not opening up communication with us, it ensured us that you weren't there for a dragon (just 3 Vision that happen to be in Cobalt Scar at the time).  We didn't think we had anything to worry from you, since you saw us there first, and never got a hold of us asking if that's what we were in the zone for.  So we didn't rush the pull, nor look at /who again to see your force grow quickly.<br>
<br>
If you were deep in the Halls of Testing, and we entered the Halls and started crawling as well... how would you feel if we said <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, well we didn't know you were here already, since you didn't send us tells letting us know upon our arrival to the zone&quot;?  <br>
<br>
How would you like it if we just entered the Halls and started fighting, without getting a hold of you at all to find out where you were camped (as not to bump into one another)?<br>
<br>
That's exactly what you did to us in Cobalt Scar.  You saw us there first, but didn't ask as to what we were there for.  But you expected US to?  We had no idea you were going for dragon since you weren't there in force when we were.  Are we to check in with Vision to make sure it's &quot;okay&quot; to hunt at all tomarrow?  I don't think so.<br>
<br>
If I enter a zone, it is NOT the job of everyone present in the zone ahead of me to just magically know that I've arrived, and to start sending me tells informing me of the targets they're all doing.  It is not the job of every group in a zone to constantly do /who's and track every new person entering.  It's the responsability of the new person to the scene.  It's common sense.<br>
<br>
I don't want to hear talk of &quot;We'll work with you if you treat us with respect&quot; when you showed us none by saying we had to get a hold of you because you just graced the zone with your presence.<br>
<br>
I don't want to hear talk of &quot;and if you don't want to work with us, then we'll do our best to beat you to targets fairly and be humble about it when we don't&quot;, when YOU didn't want to work with US.<br>
<br>
It's pure bullshit, and frankly I'm suprised as hell hearing such a hypocritical statement:<br>
<br>
&quot;We'll work with you if you treat us with respect; and if you don't want to work with us, then we'll do our best to beat you to targets fairly and be humble about it when we don't.&quot;<br>

Five of us took down Lodizal un buffed while a dozen or so other people stood there laughing at us (until we won of course). Was it wrong? Not really. Was it rude? Some people may say that, but we saw a mob we wanted dead and no one else was killing it /shrug&quot;<br>
<br>
You didn't do anything wrong nor rude.  There wasn't an established presence for said turtle present for you to have stole from.  If there was a group there about to pull and you rushed in and nabbed him first, you still wouldn't be wrong, just rude.<br>
<br>
But that's not what I'm mad about.  Not the pull itself, or the race to the mob.  It's the lack of communication.  They came into the zone and never contacted us at all... then turn around and say in this forum that if they're communicated with and respected that they would back down or come to an agreement.  That's hypocritical.  Saying that communication would have solved the issue, but practice no communication of their own when they should have. <p>--Lord Hagus Bruichladdich, 60 Warlord of Divine Legion.<BR>

<br>
My statements aren't contradictory.  <br>
<br>
The situation at Kalorek`Dar is much more like Lozidal than Trakanon.  Trakanon is about GEOGRAPHY and Lozidal is about READINESS.  If you have a GEOGRAPHICAL advantage on Trakanon (you've passed lower exit and have a magician), most people conceed the camp.  If you have a READINESS advantage on Lozidal (e.g. you have enough people to kill him) then people respect your pull/kite.<br>
<br>
I use two examples to show two different situations where two different sets of &quot;understood&quot; rules apply.  Having 40 people in Sebilis first isn't worth anything if you don't mobilize and get to the mushrooms first.  Similarly, being at Lozidal isn't worth a hill of beans if you aren't ready to kill him.<br>
<br>
I simply submit that Kalorek`Dar is about readiness.  10 Vision players were ready to kill Kalorek`Dar before 20 Divine Legion players were.  Had a Divine Legion puller swam out to Kalorek`Dar and pulled him, no Vision would have interfered; and, if asked, we would have helped.  If Kalorek`Dar had 10 guards that needed cleared, and Divine Legion was clearing them already (like the Trakanon/Juggernaut example), no Vision would have gone near his spawn unless to offer help.  <br>
<br>
Kalorek`Dar has no guards; no Divine Legion puller/tracker was in the water; Vision was ready first.  Vision killed Kalorek`Dar, found my corpse, looted up and headed off to Western Wastes where Scout Charissa was waiting, sans bag.<br>
<br>
Everyone works by these unwritten &quot;understood&quot; rules.  We all know what the Verant rules say, and we all know what the community thinks, and we all have our own values.  The reason that Trakanon is the way Trakanon is, is that the people who kill Trakanon &quot;just do it like that.&quot;  The reason that Lozidal is the way Lozidal is, is that the people who kill Lozidal &quot;just do it like that.&quot;<br>
<br>
The *old* Ragefire is another example that transcends a Grand Unified Theory of Engagement.  As it stood, the &quot;understood&quot; Ragefire camp was that you respect the cleric who spends a weekend waiting for him to spawn, and then he gets a &quot;reasonable although non-quantifiable period of time&quot; to gather the necessary forces to kill Ragefire.<br>
<br>
To each encounter there is an &quot;understood&quot; rule of engagement.  Try asking CB and VV what the rules of engagement for Vulak are when they're both in NToV with Eternal Wrath.<br>
<br>
I think our rules of engagement for &quot;big targets&quot; are fairly conservative, even more restrictive than most guilds of our size, and certainly within what the &quot;community&quot; finds acceptable.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You entering the zone does not mean that we have to quickly bow down and open communication, like you're &quot;above&quot; opening it with us or something. Superior attitudes really piss me off. We were in force first and medding up to pull, we should not have to drop everything to start a line of communication with you, when you should have opened it with us first.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Two issues here, I'll try to take them seperately.<br>
<br>
First, you keep saying you were there in force.  Numbers don't equate to readiness.  Having more people in a zone doesn't make you any more or any less ready to engage a target.  You say yourself that we had people in the zone while you were gathering.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Well, we were gathing too.  We just gathered the NECESSARY and READY force faster.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Second, as to you who has to ask who...  ...sadly it boils down to this:  If our two guild run into a similar situation, and there is no communication, then it is likely, based on previous events that Vision will end up winning the race.  If our two guilds run into a similar situation, and there <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> IS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> communication, unless you plan on holding a grudge, our guilds will probably end up working together.<br>
<br>
Compare that to us forming up for a mob that Eternal Wrath wants to kill.  Eternal Wrath need not, under any circumstance that I can imagine, ever send us a tell asking for our &quot;permission&quot; to do anything.  On several occasions, we've sent them tells asking to do things with them.  As a result of that, Vision has a nice working relationship with Eternal Wrath.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> [Obviously the comparision between DL &lt; Vision &lt; EW isn't quite linear, but it helps demonstrate my point.]</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
We're faced with two choices, (a) silently race Eternal Wrath and lose, or (b) open dialogs with them and participate.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> when YOU didn't want to work with US.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This is gonna sound harsh, but I want to keep the terms simple.  At present, it benefits YOU more than it benefits US for our guilds to work together.<br>
<br>
Some targets are, and will always be a race.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It's pure bullshit, and frankly I'm suprised as hell hearing such a hypocritical statement:<br>
<br>
&quot;We'll work with you if you treat us with respect; and if you don't want to work with us, then we'll do our best to beat you to targets fairly and be humble about it when we don't.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I think you should ask around.  Ask Exiled Alliance how last night went, or how Wuoshi has gotten killed recently, or even how we've distributed the loot with them.  Ask Scorcha how her epic is doing.  Ask Warfrost about his shot at a Green Dragonscale.  Ask any of the guilds we helped do an imporant target or assisted in their corpse recoveries.<br>
<br>
Even ToV, whom we butt heads with on a regular basis...  ...ask them, that if nothing else, outside of a few pokes and jabs at each other, if Vision treats them respectfully with regard to competition for spawns.<br>
<br>
I can only close by asking you not to let this sour working with us again. It's throwing out the baby with the bathwater - cutting off your nose to spite your face.<br>
<br>
I think you'll find that we'd be open to raiding any target you wanted to raid together as long as there was something mutually beneficial to be gained.<br>

This is the key phrase in this whole thing. <br>
<br>
The name of the game is pull and kill the mob first. If you can do it with 1 do it with one...with 10? whatever just pull it and kill it or someone else will.<br>
<br>
Sorry to say but there is no courtesy in EQ untill after the mob is dead and those who got the kill have taken what they want. People get real friendly then. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=36323">Caean Sacroguerre, Knight of Tunare</a>

<br>
&quot;The situation at Kalorek`Dar is much more like Lozidal than Trakanon.&quot;<br>
<br>
Why did you type?:<br>
<br>
&quot;We perceived this much like a Trakanon or Lozidal raid.&quot;<br>
<br>
I can only respond to what you type.  It takes psychic abilities to determine what you really meant if you typed something different.  You said you perceived this much like a Trakanon or Lozidal raid, when the Trakanon part was flat out untrue.<br>
<br>
&quot;Numbers don't equate to readiness. Having more people in a zone doesn't make you any more or any less ready to engage a target. You say yourself that we had people in the zone while you were gathering. Well, we were gathing too. We just gathered the NECESSARY and READY force faster.&quot;<br>
<br>
But when you say that you perceive this like a Trakanon raid, 17 of us present 3 of you, you imply that you would not leapfrog an already established force in the area... which was an untrue statement, and what I'm calling  you on.  If your Trakanon comment hadn't been in there, that section of your post would not have needed commenting on.<br>
<br>
And like I said, I don't care about the spawn.  We let our guard down because we thought there'd be a mutual respect, we were wrong and you burned us.  There's really nothing more to say about who beat who to the spawn, because that's not the issue I'm interested in.  You beat us there because we made the mistake of thinking you'd respect our presence and took our time (there were THREEEE of you present at this time).  <br>
<br>
This is my real beef, and you just did it AGAIN:<br>
<br>
&quot;Second, as to you who has to ask who... ...sadly it boils down to this: If our two guild run into a similar situation, and there is no communication, then it is likely, based on previous events that Vision will end up winning the race. If our two guilds run into a similar situation, and there IS communication, unless you plan on holding a grudge, our guilds will probably end up working together.&quot;<br>
<br>
You talk of &quot;if there's communication&quot;... but YOU were not willing to communicate with US.  Don't talk about being willing to work together if we only communicate, when you went out of your way to NOT communicate.  WE were not obligated to send a tell to YOU... YOU were obligated to send a tell to US.  You, with the way you are talking, are saying that you'll enter a zone, and if the forces there (that you can plainly see there already) don't send Vision a tell, then Vision will race them to the target.  And I ask you, &quot;Who the hell do you think you are?&quot; that we have to communicate with YOU when you should have been the ones openning communication first.  It's a superior attitude.  The &quot;We don't send tells to those types of people, they send tells to us&quot; attitude.  Sorry, no.  When you enter a zone, YOU do a &quot;camp check&quot;, the ZONE doesn't automatically detect your presence and start sending you tells from every camp across the place.<br>
<br>
Communication was not open because YOU did not open it (we were 17, you were just entering and had 3).<br>
<br>
If your intention was no communication, and to race from the start, there would have been no discusion here and I would not have popped up and said anything.  BUT, you in your post say that if communication had taken place, things could have been worked out.  Funny, saying &quot;well if you would have only communicated&quot;, when you had no intentions of communicating.  THAT'S what you did that has me posting... NOT that you beat us to the spawn.<br>
<br>
Let's say VS is up.  A guild is in force and buffing near his room getting ready to rush in.  Then another guild rushes into the room, not saying a word to the one sitting there, takes VS, then turns to the other guild and says &quot;If you would have only communicated with us, we could have worked something out&quot;.  That's what you did to us.  YOU don't have the right to say you took the spawn because we didn't communicate with YOU...  because YOU should have communicated with US.<br>
<br>
It's not the spawn.  It's the fact that you feel that we must &quot;answer to you&quot; before thinking about taking a spawn somewhere.  That whole section about -we should have communicated with you- is a degrading, pushy, and rude.  You did NOT respect us as an equal (which EVERYONE is), and looked down upon us, as we were lower than you and should have asked nicely for the spawn or something.  It's bullshit, pure bullshit.<br>
<br>
I thank you Sandin54 for those words.  You at least seem to understand... Palimax however only repeated that we needed to communicate with him, disrespecting and degrading us a second time.<br>
<br>
We do not answer to Vision, you do not answer to us.  When you enter a zone, the inhabitants are not obligated to TELL you what they plan on hitting... the person ENTERING the zone is obligated.  The opposite implies a superior, we own this place, answer to us or we take it, attitude. <p>--Lord Hagus Bruichladdich, 60 Warlord of Divine Legion.<BR>
