The raid ran rougly 3 and a half hours. We won pouches for Dakyraz, Laran, Lothorn, Glimmer, Malone and myself. Malone and Lothorn saw Quills drop, which they generously passed on to Glimmer and myself. Thanks a lot guys, you saved me from Kedge Keep hell!<br>
<br>
We are still missing a rune branded girdle that was said to be dropped and never reached the lootmaster. Considering that it will be rather impossible to get it back or let people gather to roll for it again I hope whoever got it puts it to good use for their character. <p>Snarky Stabwell - dexterous fingers for hire.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uvibesjoker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ViBeSJoKeR</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elite Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(9/16/01 7:10:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=252.topic&index=24>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.jollyjokers.com/vibes.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Groups and Raid Information </span><hr size=1> Wtf...<br>

<br>
First of all .. we came with 36! members to help you, we were present 1 hour ahead where your own Guild brought 12 people.<br>
We had all Key classes in the lvl 60 available for your event.<br>
We were last in queue for our Rogue and even accepted that position.<br>
<br>
During the event a Robe dropped Fettsack looted it (nothing bad about fettsack btw) and he did not get "disciplined" as you so nicely call it.<br>
During the event a Ranger only sword dropped "no drop" and our Ranger got denied his opportunity to lotto (you might and probably have not even noticed this), we still did not complain and the one that looted it (whoever it was) did not get Disciplined.<br>
Then the General was pulled (2nd 1) and when he got killed the Groupleader (Damianthorn) of that group who got the kill checked the loot and announced this in /ooc (He is an officer of Matahari) and you have the balls to tell him to leave the raid after we gave you half our Guild for this event.<br>
After we did not claim Any! loot or Anything else for that matter for our assistance.<br>
<br>
The RBG dropped and both your lootmasters as you so nicely appointed were LD and our High Council member kept it for safe keeping.<br>
<br>
Now .. You Snarky should first of all have the decency to give me a tell before you told my officer to remove himself for the raid calling him some shit over shout.<br>
You Snarky should KNOW that if a Guild brings 36 members to help you they do not have any bad intentions whatsoever.<br>
You Snarky can gather the other 2 Guild/Event leaders to random for the RBG untill that time we will keep it because to be honest you are far more of a disgrace and I do not believe that if we give it to you this will be correct to us or the other guilds that attended.<br>
<br>
I rather destroy the item then pass it on to you.<br>
<br>
To insult players and guilds that help you by bringing almost 50% of all people present is an act of stupidness.<br>
<br>
Now you can have your fun and flame me as you please.<br>
But not "disciplining" players who actually looted stuff they should not have and telling someone to leave the raid who did not loot didly is just plain ignorant and stupid.<br>
<br>

I do not like flames, it does not help anyone and does not solve problems or withunderstandings that happened in the game normally. Thus I would like to have a chat with you in game. The way I got to know you so far, I believe you will understand in the same way your officer Palindar did yesterday night. And will delete your previous two posts and add an excuse to all other guilds that attempted at this raid.<br>

Hope to speak to you soon and to solve it out,<br>

Well newsflash, not only did he die, he died faster every single time after Matahari left, most likely due to people not screwing around!<br>
<br>
Your guildmates were constantly breaking the rules set forth before and at the time of the hunt. They were sitting and running around way out in front of the designated area to fight in (im glad the pullers never brought the last DE in the camps direction or those players on the hillside would have agroed it). They were spamming randoms and the shout/ooc, they were constantly pissing and moaning about how long the hunt was taking. They were checking corpses and grabbing items that designated people were supposed to handle. <br>
<br>
It is those actions that caused Snarky to tell Damianthorn to leave the hunt. Perhaps some people think Snarky told Damian to leave in the wrong manner, but nonetheless, he broke the rules on a Epic hunt and Damianthorn was in the wrong! If one of my guildmates had done the same thing, I woulda been bitching at them hardcore... in fact from watching the actions of your guildmates thruout the hunt, I was constantly reminding my guild to stay near the road marker and whatever you do, DO NOT touch any corpses. Now if my small time guild realizes that, I dont understand how your "elite" group of individuals couldnt comprehend it.<br>
<br>
You guys were guests of Snarky's guild, but you were the worst kind of guests conceivable... rude, undisciplined, and unruly. If I was in charge of that hunt, I woulda booted half of your guild from the bullshit they were pulling the entire time. I have no clue how the hell you guys kill bigger crap with people that refuse to ignore directions.<br>
<br>
Now if this post pisses off all of Matahari and they blacklist me over it, so be it. I wont hold it against them, but I am posting my view on the situation from a neutral standpoint and I stand by it. Some of your guildmates screwed up, they were reprimanded, and you threw a tantrum and had all of them leave over it. YOU were in the wrong, but now you choose to lay the blame on Snarky. Seems like this quote from a very wise man fits here: "Responsibility is a heavy responsibility!"<br>
<br>
Sidenote: Thanks to Snarky and Botschaft, you helped make 6 rogues very happy yesterday! <p><A HREF="http://members.home.net/moonie1/Yuegou.htm">Master Yuegou Windwalker</A><BR>

<br>
I am not interested in fanning any flames or starting them in the first place. I want to state a few facts and my personal view and leave the judgement to the reader. <br>
<br>
Why you would choose to denounce me is beyond me, I assume you got your vanity pinched something fiercly, I apologize if that helps you restore your composure. <br>
<br>
Titles and robes mean little to me, I am more of a peer-to-peer guy, but everyone as their fancy strikes them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
This was an invitational multi-guild epic raid that I organized and led. I also designated raid officers for the different jobs at hand before anyone was asked to appear at the meeting spot. Custom has it that this means the participants agree to the rules set forth. Custom also has it, that additional commands from the raid leader are to be accepted or you leave the raid if you don't like them - which, I assume, is the option you chose for your guild as a whole as their elected leader. That certainly is within your privileges and as you may remember was so accepted without a grudge. <br>
<br>
The raid was successful none the less and over my wildest dreams so. The reduced number of participants killed the General four more times before we turned over the camp to Allied Giants. Two rogues that participated on short notice received their pouches and one of them a quill to boot. Two rogues, myself included, left the raid with their Epic in hands.<br>
<br>
You are claiming that several people were looting without permission. I cannot confirm or deny that without feedback from the loot officer, who is unavailable at the moment. I know for sure that your officer was the only one to touch a General corpse without permission, as I stood next to each and every of them after they fell to supervise that. Why the rune branded girdle was not turned over to the loot officer after she was avaiable again I do not know, I was not informed about it having been taken from the corpse until after your guild had left, nor was it possible to figure out who in particular had taken it.<br>
<br>
I am not aware of any ranger-only no drop weapon that would drop off any of the mobs we pulled, nor that any other guild than yours brought rangers along. Since I have not seen anything rot but the last two generals SK weapons, I doubt it went unappreciated if there was indeed one.<br>
<br>
As far as your officers go, you received both a tell from me about Karacho's unwanted advances regarding taking over pulling and/or the raid lead and about your own unassigned acticity in distributing loot. I would think that two shots to the bow would wake the thickest skull and that officers should be the finest of their guilds, but that may be my personal bias and not managable in real life. <br>
<br>
I do not think, however, that the fact that your guild was the biggest group of participants in this invitational raid excempted it from the customs and rules of the raid. That applies in particular, considering that they were in violation of your very own raid guide, as posted on your website. <br>
<br>
I think you have your work cut out for yourself in putting order into your own guild and into the image you want that guild to represent to the public. I think you and the officers in question went down a couple notches with a great many people last night, including some of the better players in your own guild. That again, is my personal impression after receiving multiple tells.<br>
<br>
I will take you up on the RBG issue. I will meet with you and we roll on the belt for your guild, mine, Yuegou's, the Ritter der Leere and the independent folks that were there. You can roll for half of them and I will roll for the other half, after which it will be given to the winning group for distribution as they see fit.<br>
<br>
The above statements represent my personal views only and are not representative for any of the other participants in the raid of the Botschafter des Schicksals guild. I am not an officer of the Botschafter des Schicksals guild. <p>Snarky Stabwell - dexterous fingers for hire.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uvibesjoker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ViBeSJoKeR</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elite Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(9/16/01 5:03:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=252.topic&index=32>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.jollyjokers.com/vibes.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Groups and Raid Information </span><hr size=1> Next time when you have a problem with anyone during any of your invitation raids be sure to give their representatives a tell instead of putting them down in public, this was a bad show of how to "execute" someone especially when that someone was representing a force that was there to help you achieve something without asking anything in return (we are well able to take down the General with our own force).<br>
<br>
And next time do not insult a Guild on a public board when there is absolutely no need for it.<br>
<br>
If you feel you got treated unfair (as we did) you take it up either by e-mail or in personal tells, putting down text as you did was unneeded and served no purpose other then to insult someone or put someone down.<br>
<br>
I will not step back for what I said and I will not allow any of our members being insulted when they had absolutely no harm in mind.<br>
They all gathered to help you and your way of saying thanks was by telling them to get lost and by insult them a little more on this board, this is what pisses me off.<br>

<br>
&quot;I will take you up on the RBG issue.&quot;<br>
<br>
amazing how much greed you show.<br>
Snarky you asked why he denounced you well maybe because all we heard during the whole raid was, &quot;snarky shouts, wha wha wha wha wha.&quot;  <br>
You had 80 ppl there and you choose to pull greens for over 1 hour and were bitching because ppl werent in EXACT spots? 80+ ppl there are going to spread out...maybe you wouldnt know that and maybe all your 12 members were in the exact spots.  Theres preperation and theres unorganization is doesnt take 1hr+ of pulling every newb green mob in the zone w/ 80 ppl to take 1 general.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think you have your work cut out for yourself in putting order into your own guild and into the image you want that guild to represent to the public. I think you and the officers in question went down a couple notches with a great many people last night, including some of the better players in your own guild. &quot;<br>
&quot;I am not an officer of the Botschafter des Schicksals guild. &quot;<br>
<br>
uhm to be blunt, what would you actualy know then.<br>
<br>
<br>
well let me tell YOU what YOU know...not much very unorganized and when shit doesnt go your way you play the blame game!! ooo ooo its matahari fault.   jus like a lil baby.<br>
<br>
&quot;snarky shouts, wha wha wha wha wha.&quot; <br>
&quot;snarky shouts, wha wha wha wha wha.&quot; <br>
<br>
lighten up its a GAME.  Yes obviously you could do it w/o matahari, we provided overkill and to get the job done sooner but you were to busy being rude and annoying.<br>
<br>
&quot;snarky shouts, wha wha wha wha wha.&quot; <br>
   ooo ooo its matahari fault.<br>

Grats to all who received their epic on that day.<br>
<br>
Valiant Crusaders is not a large guild, but we are growing and maturing into the mid 50s, and we're always willing to return the favor on such raids.  Please keep us posted for future raids wherever our aid might be useful.<br>
