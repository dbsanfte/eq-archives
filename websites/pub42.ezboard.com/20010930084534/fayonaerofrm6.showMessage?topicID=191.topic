<br>
at rage...they didnt ks you..they would not have ksed you..but the fact of the matter is rage was up..they have clerics that need the mob and there is a chance you might fail. were they supposed to stay there and hold your hand or let you fail multiple attempts? yeah maybe it sucks but scions plays for scions..just like CN plays for CN..its not their objective to help vision get epics but they wont stoop to KSing no matter what. i KNOW this. i see it time and time again in the planes..some small guild is farming and CN/EW/DW/Scions whoever zonez in and all the noobs start whining about &quot;uberguild ksed my dragon!!&quot;<br>
<br>
get over it. this is a game..sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. any other game but EQ and scions could zone into solb..beat up vision and take ragefire. some of you whiners need to stfu and get a little more proactive with the game..its the way you get things done because whether you like it or not..SOMEBODY is gonna take the initiative if you dont..but i suppose you think cuz your 55 or 60 and pay your 10 bucks a month you DESERVE an epic<br>

(PS this is not a personal attack on Tolnik or anyone in Vision but simply a statement on the direction EQ has gone and why I think its starting to suck so bad and be so boring..competition and conflict are what makes things exciting..a pure utopian server would be VERY VERY boring..btw grats on your epic Tolnik) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/utolnik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tolnik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(4/18/01 6:11:00 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Scions of the Phoenix - Have they changed?</span><hr size=1> Elviscerator - we share slightly different views here.. I do agree that people should not whine - but I do not agree on the fact that since we all share the same server we should not be a little kind to one another.. unless it is the dark path you wish to choose.. if that is the case, with any dark intention it will be frowned upon by those of good ilk, and in my opinion be openly advertised.<br>
<br>
Nothing against you either or your guild - but Vision stands for helping other people and repecting peoples initiatives. If someone is camping a spawn we want - we let them have at it.. we do not breathe down thier necks - nor do we threaten to take the spawn from them if they fail.<br>
<br>
This may be a little to PC for yah but it is how we are and what we stand for. I feel that what you and you guild does reflects on your guilds character - period.<br>
<br>
If you want to be known as a KSing guild, or a guild that would take advantage of another guilds misfortunes, then hey go for it is what I say.. but bringing that to the server populations attention is not wining.. it is pure information being brought to the populace to so they can remain informed.<br>
<br>
People praise people for things that are good and inform people of shady doings.. that was all this was.. information use it as you will.<br>

I read the whole thing &amp; don't see at any time that Scions rushed you or threatened to KS from you.  In fact you were told to take your time &amp; get buffed up to prepare for Ragefire.  We weren't even in the same room to avoid lag problems.  <br>
<br>
In fact the only person that said we were going to KS from you were your spies in the guild.  So let's talk about scruples here &amp; morals.  It's a very fine line - if any - between a traitor and a liar.  When you asked Scions members if we were going to KS from you the answer was &quot;no&quot;.  You simply jumped to conclusions from what your spies said.  We also had a cleric in there that'd been camping that room for a long time &amp; still had a necro in the room to watch for spawn while the cleric got a few hours of sleep.  Or did the traitor bother to tell you that?<br>
<br>
Btw, we're the same &quot;evil guild&quot; that rezed your guild at the Chardok King and let you loot the cleric item.   <p>Magna Maleficus <BR>

The past is the past - Phoenix was a great guild at one time.. and yes they had gone outa their way in the past..<br>
<br>
But these are logged observations I am making now in the present.<br>
<br>
Give what excuses you may.. admitted by your own members mouths is what this log displays.. I am just bringing it to light for others to view.<br>
<br>
Evil is not what is being examined here - guild direction and its members intentions are.<br>
<br>
- in regards to the camp comment -<br>
<br>
And btw no one was in the room when I started camping it... the necro came in long after we had cleared the FG's and said he would not contest the spawn.. I have that logged as well.<br>
<br>
So in fact your cleric was not in that room on this particular occasion.<br>
<br>
I acquired the room right after Looking Glass' cleric had to camp for personal reasons.<br>
<br>
But you are probably right because you were up with me and the other vision members there in that room from 3:30am that morning till 1pm when he spawned huh ;P<br>

If you were still on after that you would find out that Membrayne - the mage that looted the staff has volenteered to help on friday get another for those that feel they were wronged.. I assume that to be you Afierra.<br>

We killed a mob that was pulled to us - not intentionally stolen(if it was truely pre-engaged to begin with).. and we offered to help recipricate the loot lost at next spawn. /shrug not intentional and we offer to help the offended parties get another.. we ARE bad.<br>

I wasn't gonna comment but maybe there is a little to be said. This has been rehashed many times over on this board. Maybe the names change but its still pretty much the same. Guild A feels they were wronged by bigger Guild B so they post a complaint about Guild B. Guild B naturaly feels they did nothing wrong and thus defend their name and maybe take a few potshots at Guild A. Others will chime in and comment how their guild or friends of theirs in Guild C also got screwed over by Guild A or Guild B. Thus, Guild A and Guild B (and Guild C)probably arn't going to hesitate to try to screw each other over on the next opportunity they get in Game. Just as well, since by bringing it here for all to see, no one is going to be very surprised to see that happen. <br>
<br>
What gets accomplished? Nothing. Most everyone loses, except maybe Guild B who is strong enough not to care. If this whole rant is about competion, then it is this kinda stuff on NAG that usually fuels even more cut-throut competion so it becomes a self-fullfilling prophesy.  <br>
<br>
The Moral of the Story: <br>
<br>
Go play. You get a lot more accomplished that way even if you don't always get to fight the big fights. If someone beats you to the punch, then find something else to do. Reguardless of what people say, there is usually plenty of big fights out there. Tolnik, you still got your Epic, did you not? Maybe it would have been better to go find some adventures so you had an opportunity to demonstrate the power of that Epic and justify all that hard work, instead of coming here and doing damage.<br>

Scions didn't kill steal. The &quot;spy&quot; could very easily have been telling a twisted version of Scion's intentions. But Scions didn't need to be there. Do guilds want things so bad that they stand in line now for a shot?  Is Ragefire a rock concert? <br>

Everytime that my friends and I have personally killed the Magi (5 times) no staff.  Now we get a pull that has what I was camped in Hate for close to 3 weeks straight for, and have been trying at for 7 months rigorously, only to be killed off to the side of me.  That is what gets to be much to swallow.  Sure your help is appreciated, but how long will it be until another staff drops, and doesn't go to some larger guild rushing up to kill Inorrukk? (FYI Last night the Magi for the first time on the server spawned in the Rev house, it has always spawned upstairs in Inny's old lair)  Frankly I have never heard of Membrayne until last night...that is what I am upset about. <p><strong>"It is often said the will to live is found within the person...I have found it in the fear of living"</strong></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uafierra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Afierra</A> at: 4/18/01 2:44:56 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uconaddor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Conaddor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(4/18/01 3:11:49 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Scions of the Phoenix - Have they changed?</span><hr size=1> I read the Log and the only Person who was saying Scions Planned to KS is the Mother#$@%$#$ traitor in our guild.

If this person, who is lower than whale shit, is telling you something I would weigh it against the fact that they are in a Guild and doing this.

<br>
Ellka and Revoltin have been taking turns sitting inside Traks lair for over 2 weeks now so you being there a whole day is not relevant to the situation.  You got your Ragefire and I congratulate you on a Job Well done.  I think I don't really understand the last part of your log about you walking into a Fedaydar smack down.  You knew they were doing her and still walked into the cove and got killed by the AoE.../sigh  What possible relevance does this have for Ragefire?<br>
<br>
As far as VS you log out in the Ampitheater in KC you takes your chances.  We stayed in the Left courtyard.  When we saw that you had all left the zone ( died ) we began buffing and preparing.<br>
<br>
After we engaged VS your members engaged him and attemped to KS an already engaged mob.<br>
<br>
On a side note this is the first time on Ayonae Ro that Scions has even had a Chance at VS.  Every other spawn has been taken during the Day ( our working hours ).<br>
<br>
According to all the chatter on the Raid forum no one supports a schedual and its all FFA.  This means that the first to engage a mob is the owner.  You can't claim a Zone ( plane ), Dragon or Any spawn.<br>
<br>
I consider Ragefire yours if you turn in the pearl.  I also beleive most of Scions Members feel this way too.<br>

<br>
I say, that your new direction is fear mongering, the use and imbelishment of private information, and the use of spies (at best). Out right lieing and flaming at worst. You take liberal interpretations of sketchy info.<br>
<br>
You do not post the scoins members names, obviously because you condone their actions and will use their info in the future / or they don't exist / or you don't want them to refute your claims. Says alot about your guild. Also sounds like sour grapes being beaten to Inny and VS yesterday.<br>
<br>
In fact I know it is 'cause Visions1 sent me a tell letting me know it was, than 5 min later Visions2 told me to hurry up and look before the board admins got here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Ok, now that I have your attention...I would like for you to know some background.<br>
<br>
A while back, we (Scions of Phoenix) had a Chardok raid planned the same day as you (Visions). We got down there and started farming the King/Queen. While we were down there I made an agreement with one of your officers (I'm pretty sure it was Palimax) that we would let you have the King once you got down to where we were (near the King room). When you finally did, your guild trained us three different times and almost wiped us out each time. The first time was...someone decided to take a peek to see what we were doing. He ended up training the Queen on us. Then...after we were RECOVERING from the Queen train, another one of your members decided to run bring wanderers to our CR spot. We barely survived that. The third train came from a mage pet that ran off and aggro'd the King room...which ran over our camp. After all this, we kept our promise and even killed the king FOR you and let you loot the scroll. We also had another cleric there that needed the scroll (Thyrdryl), but we kept our promise. We could've easily told you, "You trained us three times so get the hell out," but we aren't like that. We even CR'd you after the wipeout from a mage pet train. Now you are saying that you will never give us a rez because YOUR guild overreacted and jumped to conclusions from this silly Ragefire incident. I appreciate your respect. No really, thanks.<br>
<br>
If you still don't think we have good intentions, then here's another story. A couple of weeks later, we were on the way to the Queen again. Imperial Order and Mithril Tower were doing a joint raid against the King. They were having problems splitting the King room. We waited and waited, and finally offered to help them split the King. They took us up on the offer and got four scrolls that night.<br>
<br>
We aren't bullies, and we never will be. Your post does nothing but make yourself and your guild look bad. Without us, you probably would've never been able to compete in the 'race for ragefire.' It's funny how people tend to make conflicts worse than they really are, and yet they forget all the good things that others had done to them. I suppose it was a bad decision for letting you guys take advantage of us. My fault. Btw, Congratulations on your epic. <p>Astrel Angelfire<br>-Officer-<br>

<br>
For those of you who don't know me, I'm the current guildleader of Vision.  There are a half-a-dozen officers who hold the same power as me, and, similarly, I'm the 4th guildleader Vision has had.  Tolnik, in fact, held the position before I did.<br>
<br>
Vision isn't, by any means, an berguild.  We do have 100 members, but, average level is only 52; and we can, at present, only field a single group of level 60's (Myself, Vaxumgax, Harbinzhurus, Izno, Allamar, Burnine -- interestingly enough an amazingly well rounded dungeon crawl group Necro, Shaman, Enchanter, Wizard, Warrior, Cleric...  ...but I digress)  /Who all Vision 55 60 has only during large raids exceeded the "too many names to list" limit.<br>
<br>
We are simply a large group of friends who HAPPEN to be a fairly large guild.  We welcome you all to join us in Las Vegas this year when we take our second trip together.  :)<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
I want to address a few specific points:<br>
<br>
I have several good friends in Scions of the Phoenix, and several people who I'd say that I'm well acquainted with.  When the server move happened, and none of us were sure who'd end up where, I always looked at Scions as someplace I wouldn't mind being if Vision hadn't worked out as well as it had.  In short, until quite recently, I would have put the reputation of Scions up against any guild on the sever.<br>
<br>
In fact, you'll find that nobody (from our camp anyway) is arguing that Scions broke the rules of the game.<br>
<br>
We're only a little saddened that Scions isn't exactly the good neighbor we thought they were.<br>
<br>
Nobody suggests that we didn't make life harder for Scions the night we accidentally trained them in Chardok.  We were sorry and apologetic then; and if they still feel we owe them some sort of retribution for that night, I'm prepared to make it.<br>
<br>
In the case of Ragefire, the goal of Scions ~seemed~ to be split.  There ~appears~ to be those looking out for us - the ones telling us to take our time and buff  bring the full might of our guild; and there appear to be those making it clear what's going to happen if we don't seal the deal.<br>
<br>
The rules of the game allow anyone to engage any unoccupied mob; defend themselves from any mob that engages them; and to, in short, to do pretty much what they want.<br>
<br>
I used to be under the impression that Scions was a guild that, upon entering into SolB and finding another guild's cleric at Ragefire with his forces coming from the 4-corners of the map, would actually lend that cleric a hand, instead of informing him that they would immediately rush the mob if we failed.<br>
<br>
'No, I don't plan on [KS'ing you]. We'll give you your shot, but if you fail, its our turn.'<br>
<br>
No objections.  Perfectly within the scope of the game.  In fact, it's something that I'd imagine many of you will defend as perfectly proper action.<br>
<br>
Similarly, Scions did nothing wrong, ~from a game standpoint~, last night in Karnor's castle.  Our group had inadvertently engaged VS while working out our plan of attack for our first attempt ever to kill him.  He rushed the group in the prep room, and slaughtered us wholesale.<br>
<br>
While recovering from that event, and discussing our plan of attack, Scions arrived, saw us in the prep room, issued the order in guild to attack VS (from what members have told me), and was quite successful in the attack.<br>
<br>
I applaud Scions for their efficiency and teamwork as a guild in tackling large targets and in their obviously successful alliance with Sphere of Transcendence.  I don't mean this backhanded.  I am not being sarcastic.  Kudos to you.<br>
<br>
I only lament that they are not the good neighbors that they once were.<br>
<br>
It should go without saying that this forum is primarily for complaints.  Tolnik has what at least he and I feel is a valid gripe, and we're airing it in a forum provided for that purpose.  Those of you who feel it's not appropriate should refrain from reading and participating in the 4889 messges here.  They're all similarly distasteful.<br>
<br>
If any of the officers of Scions wish to talk about this in a more civilized forum, please feel free to let me know.  Youll find that Im available nearly anytime.<br>

PS.  I haven't looked at the incident in Hate last night.  I went to sleep early.  If our members acted inappropriately, I'm sure we can make reparations that are amicable to both guilds. <p><img src=http://www.goodnet.com/~matts/sig.bmp > </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=scavywillowleaf>Scavy Willowleaf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(4/18/01 7:20:17 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Scions of the Phoenix - Have they changed?</span><hr size=1> &quot;It should go without saying that this forum is primarily for complaints.

<br>
Posting private guild chat logs from an anonymous source is fairly cheesey.  You considered them good neighbors before this...yet you've had some anon char(s) tagged w/SoP for the purpose of spying?<br>
<br>
Concerning VS, you had 3-4 people in zone calling the camp.  A lvl 60 who was one of the few you had in zone was even calling out in ooc that Venril was currently being pulled, INC.  heh. <p><CENTER><IMG

<br>
Negative.<br>
<br>
There are members of Scions of Phoenix who have multiple high level characters.  At least one of which has a character that is also in Vision - albeit mostly inactive.  I suggest that if Scions would like to know who in their guild has characters in other guilds that they simply ask them.<br>
<br>
Our guild has no exclusive membership policy.  I imagine there are other Vision members that hold similar dual-citizenships in other guilds, although I suspect it's more frequent with lower level characters.  I have no reason to ask my members about this.<br>
<br>
[Vaxumgax has a low level necro in a low level guild.  Harbinzhurus similarly has a mid-level druid in a mid-level guild.]<br>
<br>
The Scions members quoted in Tolnik's log are anonymous because they requested to him that they remain so. <p><img src=http://www.goodnet.com/~matts/sig.bmp > </p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/upalimaxsceleris.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Palimax Sceleris</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.wizards.com/magic/images/exp_sym_visions.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10> at: 4/18/01 7:31:40 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=scavywillowleaf>Scavy Willowleaf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(4/18/01 7:31:59 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Scions of the Phoenix - Have they changed?</span><hr size=1> &quot;Posting private guild chat logs from an anonymous source is fairly cheesey. &quot;<br>
