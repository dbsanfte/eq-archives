SR got too small, ML decayed, MN stayed on Sol Ro when I moved here, SWM was disbanded, I didn't feel at home in VS anymore after a quarrel between them and my main char's guild, and so on. However, I have never been kicked out of a guild...<br>Until very recently.<br><br>I promised Nydia to tell about it, because it's really a somewhat fun story, if you have the certain sens of twisted humor. <br><br>A long time ago I made and leveled characters of all classes and races, so I played on a wide range of servers. My bard was on my quartiary server if that's a word. You know, not primary, not secondary and not the one after that. I must admit I chosed a very silly name for her. Brithney. I never intended to play her seriously anyway, I was just going to try out the class and learn to twist songs in case I would play Starsong on some more major raid.<br><br>Anyway, there I was. Level 8 bard hunting in EC. Some random mage auctioned a &quot;frosted longsword&quot; or something like that. I had seen such a weapon earlier that day, and it looked cool so I considered buying one for a twink on a server I played more seriously. So, I asked what the stats was. He replied 100pp, and I told him that it was out of my pricerange since the level 8 bard was my primary character on that server, I was just curious about the stats. He say he don't remember, so we should meet at the bank. Once there, he gives me the sword, some other minor items and cash, and invite me to his guild. We chatted a bit. Nice person to talk with and all that. Nothing more, nothing less. I'm not sure if I mentioned that my main char on my main server is a mage, I think I did.<br><br>The next time I logged in, someone who later turned out to be the guildleader asked me some questions, and then started screaming at the mage for inviting me. Turned out that this rather newbiesh guild had a level limit of 20, although they made exceptions quite often. Or rather, the guildleader made exceptions, but felt challenged in authority when a officer did the same thing. I said I would disband if I wasn't wanted, no problem, but the guildleader wouldn't stop throwing his damned tantrum and quarreling with the mage. Yet he told me to stay in the guild. /shrug<br><br>The mage quitted the quild, and I quitted the server. Dropped in sometimes to say hi. Last time was like two weeks ago, wanted to wish everyone a happy new year. Never got around to that. I said hi on the guildchannel, someone made a joke about my name, and then I was not in the guild any more. I got kinda confused. Looked like a bug or a joke or something, since it just happened without anyone saying anything. <br><br>I asked some people what had happened, and noone had any idea. Finally, someone realized that the guildleader was online on a anonymous alt char, so I asked him. He then started to spew random accusations. I had said something bad several months ago. I have no memory of being rude in any way, and he had no memory of what I had said, but he was sure it was bad enough to be disguilded over. More importantly, like I said above I had logged in briefly sometimes and said hello. He had intended to disguild me, so it was a crime of mine that I had not stayed online long enough for him to get around to it. He then proceded to accuse me of being a spy for the mage, and maybe his RL friend or girlfriend or something. And so on.<br><br>In conclusion, I pity some guilds for the leaders they have. I'm glad it wasn't a char I had any intention of actually playing. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Love, Edeina<br>Highelf Arch Mage of Erollisi.<br>Citizen of <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero">Ayonae Ro</a>, member of <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/beternalwrath">Eternal Wrath</a>.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ulogixspybreak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Logix Spybreak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>AyRo IRC OP</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/14/02 4:02:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=814.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I was kicked out of a guild!!! :-)</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> SR got too small, ML decayed, MN stayed on Sol Ro when I moved here, SWM was disbanded, I didn't feel at home in VS anymore<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>&lt;blank look&gt; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/urolielkotn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RolielKotN</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/14/02 4:04:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=814.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I was kicked out of a guild!!! :-)</span><hr size=1> Love 'em and leave 'em, eh? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><IMG SRC=http://www.tiannathomas.com/images/roliel3.gif><small><br>-------------- Proud member of the Valiant Crusaders, Ayonae Ro ---------------</small></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uedeina.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Edeina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Board Mistress</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/14/02 4:11:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=814.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.one.se/users/chribesk/edeina.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I was kicked out of a guild!!! :-)</span><hr size=1> /smirk Logix<br>Three years is a long time, after all.

I also made a few hot keys so that he could get into groups and what not, hot keys that said, /say Hi do you guys need a warrior? and stuff like that. At 6 years old he can barely read a word, and he cant type at all of course. Believe it or not his Warrior is lvl 19 and fights in Oasis alot. I will wander over to him when its his bed time or time to get off the computer, and I will tell his group &quot; hi im Ryumphs dad, he has to log now guys, good hunting to you. And sometimes people would ask why he never talked, I would then tell them he is only 6 years old and cant type yet, MUCH to their dismay. Anyway one day my son comes over to me and says Daddy, they keep saying stuff to me in my guild (god only knows who invited him into a guild) So I go over and scroll up, and see stuff like, Ryumph if your not going to talk to us we are going to kick you the F$#@ out. There were several other comments to him also, but I dont remember them. I got a HUGE kick out of telling that guild that I was Ryumph's Dad and he is only 6 years old.

I run into preteen children pretty regularly in the game (most unhesitatingly give their age when asked), and some of them are far more pleasant to group with than their more 'mature' counterparts.  If your son was a good tank, knowing Orc Highway, I'm willing to bet his groupmates sure wouldn't care if he 'shut up and pulled <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> '.  And since all you have to be able to do is hit a 'yes' button to join a guild, I'm not surprised he ended up in one.  It's just too bad he had to be subjected to all the bad language, hopefully he didn't understand most of it...  I really do feel sorry for small children in the game, one almost wishes VI would give child players a childlike avatar so that people would know that the player was a minor.  And if I see Ryumph in the Oasis one of these days, I'll be sure to buff him, and my little shaman won't mind in the least if he doesn't talk in groups... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Regards,<br>Nydia Ywalmoriel<br>Autonomous Collective<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uedeina.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Edeina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Board Mistress</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/15/02 12:38:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=814.topic&index=11>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.one.se/users/chribesk/edeina.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I was kicked out of a guild!!! :-)</span><hr size=1> /nod Mokas<br>Easy come, easy go.<br><br>/laugh Sandin<br>Your story is even better then mine! <p>Love, Edeina<br>Highelf Arch Mage of Erollisi.<br>Citizen of <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero">Ayonae Ro</a>, member of <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/beternalwrath">Eternal Wrath</a>.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucymril.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cymril</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/15/02 1:11:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=814.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I was kicked out of a guild!!! :-)</span><hr size=1> Ohh Sandin...I'm gonna get you!

I remember a conversation I had with a player regarding helping them with trade skills. I taught this particular player how to fish, amongst other things. As we were fishing, there was the system message about 'You spilled your beer whilst reeling in your line' (to paraphrase), and she [the player] said something along the lines of 'Drink beer? I'm only 13 LOL!'.<br><br>I didn't ask her age because for me it is not relevant, but Nydia touched upon just how trusting children are. Now lets dispell the media sensation with meeting Boogeymen on the internet. But there <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> is</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a justifiable concern with children being a little too trusting, as well as being subjected to bad langauage, inapproriate content yada, yada, yada.<br><br>What it comes down to is parental responsibility. So I hope that those who do let their children play supervise their siblings. It is not so much children that I distrust but more a percentage (demographic) of the player base who act like assholes either through behaviour or casual cussing.<br><br>Good story about the guild invite, Sandin.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/usandin54.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sandin54</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/16/02 4:43:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=814.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Trust</span><hr size=1> The only reason my son even noticed the chat box was because his character name is Ryumph and his real name is Ryan, he can barely read the word yes, no, and a few other 3 letter words so I dont have to worry about him seeing bad words just yet. I could remove the chat box intirely and he would be happy because he could see more of the screen as far as that goes. But I do check him very regularly, mostly to make sure he isnt spamming some group to get an invite, or KSing anyone. he is actually pretty good about not KS'ing these days, and he is constantly telling me Daddy that monster belongs to someone else. He is really a riot to watch play sometimes. I personally think its quite funny that he can never go back to his home in Kaladin because he &quot;helped that guy kill those guards.&quot; One day he came to my crying when he was lvl 6 or so, and told me &quot;Daddy my guards are killing me every time I get near them&quot; as a tear ran down his eye. I had to move him to freeport area then because he wsa caught in a death cycle. it took me a while to figure out how to get him out of there ) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/urosoasiangirl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Roso Asiangirl</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/16/02 5:00:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=814.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://iqwebstorage.homestead.com/files/statshot.jpg width=200 Hiedth=170></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Trust</span><hr size=1> I think you should all just join my guild, its called, UBER HEROES OF THE BESTEST SERVER!<br><br>Join or else <p><center><font color="red">Ubique - I see you, Roso, like a star in a dark nebula.
