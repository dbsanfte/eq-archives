Eddee was born Feb 1 2000 as an EC mule, I never even wanted to play a bard, but as a bard, with selo's at lvl 5, they make the best mules, since with selo's they can be at least partially mobile with any amount of encumberance.

<br>
A real life bud of mine whom some used to call Mdar and later became Craznik on the Sol Ro server got hooked on EQ a few months after release. Before then, we used to have LAN parties and play Blizzard games such as Warcraft 2, Diablo and Starcraft. <br>
<br>
Once he got EQ and got hooked, he always told me how cool it was and &quot; You need to buy this game! It kicks Diablo's Ass!&quot;. I was also told by other friends that &quot;EverCrack&quot; is more than just mildly addictive and if I valued my free time, don't get hooked (these are people who were speaking from experience). So a few months pass and I avoid EQ, until Christmas.<br>
<br>
Mdar/Craznik decides that I HAVE to be playing EQ or ELSE. I got the game for Christmas and after which.....the box sat......unopened.....for nearly two months.<br>
<br>
Finally in Febuary of 2k, he dropped by my place and the game finally got loaded. I knew I wanted to play a warrior, since I always played one in Diablo. Not knowing shit about EQ, I picked a Dark Elf warrior. No clue what the starting stats were. <br>
<br>
Time to give this Dark Elf Warrior a name. Not liking any of the random names made by the game, I was stumped. At the time I really didn't think I was gonna play the game so I just looked at objects around my desk for inspiration and did not plan on much creative energy being used.<br>
<br>
On the desk was a yellow triplicate copy of a reciept from a local construction/building supply company I did business with as a carpenter.....<br>
<br>
It was Lummus Supply Company, Atlanta GA.<br>

I was so completely dissapointed that my 41 wizard was so weak he couldnt even take a lvl 18ish mob that I went to EC sold everything on him and made a Paladin.

I quit Karmah at lvl 6 and started my first bard Cappadoccia the human (with 2 C's) got to lvl 7, then I bought my own account since I had been playing on Itera's account all along and she was getting tired of me snatching her account..

Cappa sucked hard... and she still does.. every time I log her in I die repeatedly for hours... <br>

Cymril was born after I was coerced into leaving UO after three years......God I miss making actual money in tradeskils. ))) But this is my First, and my most favorite char. Had I start EQ all over again. Well, I am not sure what I would start with. But I love my pally dearly anyways. ))<br>

<br>
My first character was made playing on my friends account and on his computer.  He was Dammur, a dwarf paladin, he made it up to level 17.<br>
<br>
I got my own account, and started an inkie sk Dammurr.  He was my alt, and remains so to this day.  I proceded to transfer all of my gear to Dommur, dwarf warrior, and proceded to level up to 20 or 21.  Somewhere after i hit unrest, i got sick of my warrior not being up to par with my original paladin.  I loved being able to cast, heal, loh, etc, especially when i was grouped with incompent clerics most of the time.  I recreated Dammur and have stayed with him ever since (excluding a month or so period that i made my sk alt my main after nc split up).<br>

I started him about two years ago.  Over the course of a few months I got him to level 14, even though he remained in cloth armor.  I then quit for a few months, came back, and levelled him to 20 along with becoming a master smith (back when banded was profitable) and putting together a full set of bronze armor.<br>
Guess what level he is now?  20. :P  But he's well on his way to becoming a grandmaster smith...still need him to make my bard some mithril plate armor. <p><FONT SIZE=-1><I>Palarran Taurina, 54 druid / Matsumura, 54 monk / Cantabile, 43 bard<BR>
