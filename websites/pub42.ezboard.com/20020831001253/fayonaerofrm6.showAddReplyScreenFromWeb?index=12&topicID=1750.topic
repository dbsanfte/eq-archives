<br>
Bixie Company<br>
Ayonae Ro, peon service<br>
Everquest <br>
<br>
July 20th, 2002 <br>
<br>
VIA MAIL AND ELECTRONC MAIL<br>
Mr. George Scotto<br>
Sony Online Entertainment<br>
8928 Terman Court<br>
San Diego, CA 92121<br>
<br>
<br>
Without Prejudice<br>
<br>
<br>
Dear Mr. Scotto:<br>
<br>
We are the members of "Bixie Company" (hereinafter "BC"), a player run guild the peon server "Ayonae Ro." We write to you on behalf of our guild, which represents approximately 5 players, many of which pay for multiple peon subscriptions to partake in the enhanced experienced promised by the Everquest Peon service.<br>
<br>
Our guild has been a part of the peon service since before the Stormhammer Legends server became live. Once the Legends service, with its premium content and enhanced service guidelines, was announced, a group of us quickly realized our intention to not migrate to the premium server because it is a ripoff. Through aggressive cross-server recruitment, promotion, and planning, we insured that by the time the Legends service opened we had a large number of customers ready and willing to join other guilds. For example, on the day the Stormhammer went live, we had approximately two hundred accounts committed to other guilds. The Bixie Company guild of today still includes at our core many of the 20 accounts present on that first day. Our reasons for not moving to the server was to not get ripped off and partake in the promised beta testing experiences legends had to offer.<br>
<br>
Since that day our guild has consistently demonstrated a high level of game play. Our accomplishments in-game has matched and exceeded that of the bottom tier guilds in Everquest. We very quickly became "the" low profile guild to measure the failure of your service by. And you will note we always capped on the legends server because it blows, and pretty much pissed off your staff and players. Our site and accomplishments were very quickly picked up and ridiculed by players on all servers in Everquest.<br>
<br>
When the inevitable conflicts over spawns with other guilds on Stormhammer began, we have consistently demonstrated a willingness to sit in the stands and make fun of the schmucks who bought into the legends scam. For example, we delayed waking the Sleeper in Sleeper's Tomb for over three months at the suggestion of the Stormhammer staff (Then Eternal Wrath fucking woke him up and stole our thunder, /rude!). Additionally, for a substantial time prior to the institution of a "calendar" system, we voluntarily avoided spawns more representative of earlier phases of the game (e.g., North Freeport) and devoted our guilds focus to new content which was not in pursuit or conflict with any other guild entities on the server. When the "calendar" system was forced upon TR, the staff admitted that spawn conflicts were greatly diminished, primarily due to our voluntary efforts.<br>
<br>
We quickly laughed our asses off at the schmucks who moved to stormhammer with the promises of new content, events, and enhanced services. It became laughingly obvious that even the Server GMs were being held hostage by the fact that they didn’t have the content that was needed to pacify so many high level players on the server.<br>
<br>
We all chuckled when you forced the calendar system on the stormhammer whiners.  We're glad the dumb bastards accepted it so that the Sony staff didn't kick their asses off the server and cut short our daily entertainment. We especially like the “trust us it will be OK” line you used on that bunch of jackasses in Township Rebellion.<br>
<br>
We would like to commend your continued efforts to screw over the Township Rebellion guild on the Stormhammer server.  your definite and distinct pattern of bias against TR through repeated acts of the Customer service staff (and principally through decisions made by GM "Bordael") are to be commended!<br>
<br>
We got worried when we heard there were repeated assurances from GM "Bordael" that such favoritism would stop, the inconsistencies would halt, and the Legends as advertised would appear. We were dismayed when spies relayed to us discussions with Senior GM staff where TR was assured that certain actions on the part of the GM’s would be “looked in to” and “addressed”. We heard that time frames were placed on questionable GM decisions with promises of direct action items to ensure these occurrences would not happen again. Thankfully, None of this has happened; in fact the inconstancies have grown in number. Way to go!  Stick it to them bitches!<br>
<br>
Your "bait and switch" tactics are truly ingenious. Drawing those fuckwits to the server under false premise and guidelines of an “enhanced gaming service” was a very nice touch. We all know that the members of TR are too stupid to have gathered any evidence to support this bias.  By the way, the San Diego Better Business Bureau doesn't really give a shit about a fucking video game, so don't sweat the complaints on file there.<br>
<br>
Now to our complaint.<br>
<br>
<br>
Notice<br>
<br>
It has come to the attention of the Bixies that certain whiners are trying to sway Verant to change from a calendar system on Stormhammer to a Free For All environment.  We are against this for the simple reason that listening to the TR players whine and bitch about sharing phat lewt provides us with considerable entertainment value.  As of July 24th, 2002 Bixie Company will continue to play in a "free-for-all" play style on the Ayonae Ro server.<br>
<br>
This decision has been made with great sadness. Each one of Township Rebellion's accounts represent players who have dedicated enormous time, energy and money into SOE's Everquest game. Many of our players have over one year of Everquest play time. Many of our players have been involved with Everquest since the beta test. In short, we take our gaming experience in Everquest seriously. Which is why are taking such extreme measures in light of the waste of our time and money.<br>
<br>
We recognize that our planned course of action may cause some friction with the TR guildmembers.  Rest assured that BC members will play Everquest in a manner consistent within the rules issued by SOE for game play across all servers. However, SOE should also recognize that if the TR guildmembers takes arbitrary retaliatory action against SOE, we would consider such actions as a serious matter. Any such action will be documented, internally reviewed, and publicized if found to be arbitrary or capricious. In this regard please understand that BC's web site (www.b-company.org) receives over 5 hits daily from Everquest subscribers and we have been considering making several "dummy" web sites that will get at least as many hits daily.<br>
<br>
In closing,<br>
<br>
We are quite happy with the situation on Stormhammer. We came here under the premise of an peon gaming experience only realize that it has a pissing and moaning entertainment component too!<br>
<br>
We feel in its current state, most especially with the lead GM in charge of customer service on Stormhammer being GM "Bordael", we will get considerable bang for our almost $15/month. If another lead customer service GM is assigned in replacement of GM "Bordael" the Bixies will be VERY MAD!  Bzzt!<br>
<br>
Our goal is not to cause problems for any player or staff member. We simply wish to play the game we have grown to love over the last nearly four years. Should the server staff wish to change its policy and get rid of the calendar on Stormhammer, BC is willing to consider relocating Eternal Wrath to another server (So the Bixies can RULE this server!), under certain circumstances. <br>
<br>
Also keep in mind that when SOE started considering getting rid of the Calendar system the Bixies had considerable time invested in reviewing web sites that had whines posted by the stormhammer population.  The premise that the Bixies moved here under is quite different than that initially promised by SOE. Thus, BC feels somewhat held hostage here on Ayonae Ro and is willing to consider relocation for Eternal Wrath (So Bixies can RULE this server!), en mass, to another Everquest server, so long as that server:<br>
<br>
(1) Does have an existing "end game" guild of at least the Bixie Company caliber;<br>
(2) Is a server not specifically marketed to non-Americans (Or fucking foreigners as we like to call em)<br>
(3) Players may transfer with all their equipment and genitals intact; and<br>
(4) Any EW member who is willing to make the transfer can take advantage of the transfer (Unless their name is Sami, he has to stay and summon Dartanian mod rods on demand!)<br>
<br>
<br>
If SOE would be willing to entertain such a transfer, please contact us, you will find us most cooperative.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind we are happy to stay on the stormhammer server and continue playing as was the intent on our move here and under the guidelines and indications of what the server was to be prior to the move. However as stated we will not be doing so under the arbitrary calendar imposed by the server staff. Otherwise we are happy to discuss the above solution as a win/win for everyone.<br>
<br>
Again, it is in no way our intention to cause friction, problems, or instigate any conflicts on the server. We simply wish to play the game.<br>
<br>
<br>
Bzzt!,<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
kind like putting all the really bad criminals on there own island and let them kill each other.<br>
<br>
<br>
i bet lots of people get disappointed and quit EQ.<br>
<br>
<br>
my friend tells me in the deep there is a mob that spawns every 3 days that drops upgraded loot then normal bosses of luclin.<br>
<br>
i told him i got a burrower helm and he said thoes all rot because some other mob that spawns every 3 days drops one with same stats but FT2 on it. <br>
<br>
<br>
It is only more of a challenge because you have a bunch of high end guilds all in 1 server fighting over mob's. they didn't make the mob's any harder they made the loot easier to get.<br>
<br>
once again VI loot whore ( tormhammer )  &quot;you get more because you pay more&quot; <br>
<br>

i am sure this has all been said before but i am biching anyway.<br>

<br>
Given the level of historical data available (some but hard to find and not very well connected), and the complexity of the quests (NOT-all variations of the same theme) in everquest nothing that lord of Kaos wrote surprised me. <br>
<br>
And nothing that the person from township rebellion wrote was very surprising either. What did they expect from a server that advertises a bunch of GM events? Been to three of them and after the first one, they were pretty lame, and the first one was only entertaining as a novelty experience. <br>
<br>
Lord of Kaos (lvl 60 monk) wrote this about playing on Stormhammer:<br>
<br>
&quot;Course some are not interested in this, so /bye<br>
<br>
Some are thinking about joining the server.<br>
<br>
First of all, its good points:<br>
<br>
Its relatively empty, easy to solo, hard to find groups (under 55) Mature (sometimes) player base. A lot of Friendly people.<br>
When you can get a GM they are by FAR more helpful then they are on blue servers, you still have to wait up to 3 hours for them though, just they are a lot more useful when you get them.<br>
<br>
Example, I left an item on a corpse because it was a late raid and I couldn't see it, it could have been bugged, but more then likely I just missed it, GM summoned my corpse to me because it was deep in a dungeon.<br>
<br>
Now for its points of suckiness.<br>
<br>
Its over priced, you get a big fat zero for you cash 99% of the time, unless your there for the above reasons, but even then its over priced.<br>
<br>
Customer Service has gone down hill consistently from the day it opened, there are less GMs online during off peak and peak hours now then there was.<br>
<br>
The 'events' if you can call them that are lame, ill thought out, ill conceived events that I wouldn't expect from a 3 year old child. They are no different from the crap events you get on the normal servers, and you know what they are like, 75 people with an avg age of 11.<br>
<br>
Some people are happy to be involved in 150 people shouting rubbish in a zone then squabbling because they just spent 3 hours and got NOTHING not even a decent RP experience from the event, I find this to be a bit lame, and if I wanted to see 150 children squabble I would just hang around in Kael until two guilds turned up to kill AoW at the same time.<br>
<br>
Stormhammer is an excellent idea, that has been completely and utterly ruined by poor implementation. The website is just the lamest thing you have ever seen, and completely useless, I do not know of a single person that even bothers with the /webupdate command, why bother when you can just use Magelo that is one thousand times better.<br>
<br>
The only things that made it unique are broken, Phantom Jewelery and Maurders Mire, both of which are no longer in the game.<br>
<br>
Its transient population of trash talking PvPers who for some reason seem to think that everybody MUST be interested in their tales of how great they were on their PvP server, or how they ganked him or her...no we are not, please shut up, please for the love of mike shut up about it, your not on a PvP server, because your a wuss, you came here to level and get gear you couldn't get there because you are some gimp twit, if you were so badassed why are you on a blue server? Now STFU!<br>
<br>
The other transient population who come to SH, see how truly crap it is and then leave again.<br>
<br>
Some guilds can retain members for a longer period then others, like Leviathan, good guild started in Vex Thal recently, now a guild like that is going to retain members, regardless of the server, because they have something to offer their players, a new experience for most.<br>
<br>
For the other 95% of the server population trying to get people to stay on the server is next to impossible, the server itself has nothing to offer in the way of being special, and since most other guilds can only offer friendship and the same stuff you can get in any number of guilds on any number of other servers its really hard to convince YOURSELF to stay.<br>
<br>
I have given SH a good long go, I have tried to see the good sides of the server, but honestly I am just about to give up justifying it and am about to return to my old server.<br>
<br>
The only thing holding me on SH right now, is the fact that there is a European guild on this server, and there was not and has never been a european guild on my old server, you cannot imagine the difference it makes raiding at 6pm in teh evening after supper compared to 4am in the morning when you are using match sticks to keep your eyes open, it actually brings back the element of fun to the game.&quot; <br>
