<br>
Do you lose your camp when you die?<br>
Is the camp FFA once you are gone, or should you be given a second chance to take it back?<br>
<br>
I think this is a very interesting subject.<br>
<br>
Back in the good old days in Guk on Sol Ro it was the custom that when a group dies or evacs they have a little while to get back to their camp, others should not move in and claim it right away. I liked that philosophy very much, but I suppose it's not as useful in places like Sebilis. Every time I have been in a deep sebilis group that needed to evac, the group fell apart before getting back to Sebilis. Thus, I don't really have a strong opinion about this at this time.<br>

If your group die because of a server outage making half the server being dropped then yes.<br>
<br>
But if you die because you can't handle a camp.  Well like what I said, you can't handle a camp, you can't hold a camp with your corpses or when you're not even in the zone.

It depends.  Generally, it's polite to give people a second chance, but hardn'y 'law'.  If you died on the break (without making a significant progress), I would say no.  If you died because you just had a run of weird spawns, I would say yes, but it's hard for someone coming upon the room to know just how you died.<br>
<br>
In the harsh world of realities (in an on-line fantasy game), if you aren't physically there to challenge the mobs for the camp, you're more than likely not going to be in a position to challenge the player(s) who move in before you get back. <p><B><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2 COLOR="#3A6EA5">Jzonn Stormwolf &lt;Final Destiny&gt;</B></FONT><BR>

<br>
Here's my take on the subject.<br>
<br>
If I zone into a zone, and go to a camp site, if nobody is there, I'm gonna set up camp.<br>
<br>
To use a Guk example, however, If I'm down the hall from Lord, killing stuff in Magi, and I hear the Lord room get waxed, I'm not picking up my stakes and moving there.<br>
<br>
In both cases it's about courtesy and reasonable expectation.  Someone who walks up to your ex-campsite has no way of knowing you wern't there, and shouldn't have to move when you get back.  On the other hand, it's just not neighborly to waltz into a freshly evaced room for the sake of greed alone.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Sorta like my "camping" thread.  If you're in Sebilis, and someone calls for a camp check while you're doing CR.  Have the courtesy to say "Doing CR in Disco 2."<br>
<br>
You can't camp something with a corpse or from another zone.<br>
<br>
Your death is clearly a sign that it just might be someone elses turn. <p><img src=http://www.goodnet.com/~matts/sig.bmp > </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ukleg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kleg</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(2/2/01 3:47:01 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~cazic/cazic/ubb/uploads/Kleg.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Do you lose your camp when you die?</span><hr size=1> I agree that courtesy dictates a reasonable amount of time to reclaim the room after death or evac.  Not allowing this is akin to waiting outside the room for the group to be killed, then rushing in and finishing off whatever mobs are left.  Ya just don't do it.<br>
<br>
It is funny how groups fall apart after something like this happens.  Like 1 death or evac spoils the entire evening for them.  I've seen groups die in L Guk and respond to camp checks with what Palimax suggested, &quot;Supplier room, but doing CR&quot;. Then, a few minutes later that same person shouts &quot;4 more needed for Supplier room!!&quot;  Um, no.  The group has obviously broken up, and I'd take the camp at that point.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>---------------------------------------------------------<BR>

The consensus usually seems to be that you should at least allow five minutes or so for the group to do CR - if nothing else so they can get their bodies out without you training the person dragging the bodies.  Usually the people that take a camp that fast are reamed in /ooc for it unless the camp was training everyone else before they died.<br>
<br>
Here's a question though - when you get one of those morons that pulls the entire zone and make a train that other morons will keep repulling because they don't understand how to pull from a train (or don't understand not to walk half way down the hall to LOOK at it) how long do you have to take your camp back, considering people will keep repulling it for a good twenty minutes before it's clear?<br>

Sorry, if you aren't clearing the spawns you do not own the camp.  I find that a lot of the time people will call a camp before they are even in it, if I beat you it's mine if you beat me it's yours, that's just the way it works.<br>
<br>
This doesn't mean that I will move into a camp that someone has died in.  I will generally give them 5-10 mins to get back, if they can't do it, sorry, it's not their camp anymore.<br>
<br>
These are the way I see things and a lot of people will disagree with me, but if you aren't physically at a camp in the room of the spawn you no rights to the mobs in that room.  A good group and a smart puller can and will always pull PHs as they spawn so they will be physically in the room of the spawn when it spawns, but if you leave a named up for too long (I'm talking in excess of 5mins.) and someone else gets to it before you well then you are SOL.<br>

<br>
Despite dying to an intentional train.<br>
Despite dying because you just barely couldn't handle it.<br>
Despite dying because half your camp went ld.<br>
<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
Well, this is the rough answer, but, because there exists a certain breed of scam artist out there who will attempt to guilt you out of a camp by claiming to have just died there.  There exists a type of person who will claim ownership of a camp even though his group couldn't handle it.  And lastly, there exists internet problems that involve hours of downtime, such that ld players cannot reliably be expected to come back.<br>
<br>
Once again, however, just because you don't have any RIGHT to the camp doesn't mean you can't negotiate to get it back, it's just that you don't have the moral high ground in asking the other group attempting to claim it to leave.  If they DO leave, they are, in fact, doing you a favor, and you should appreciate it as such, rather than expect it as your just due.  This is where it pays to have done favors for other people in the past, and not have screwed them, because if you have a bad rep, there's no way the group newly claiming the camp is going to budge.<br>
<br>
Frankly, I'm sick of thin skinned easily offended people who call every spawn they were just thinking about aggroing theirs and claim ks when the spawn is pulled.

Whatever excuse you have, valid or not, can apply to the people who just took over your camp.  Their time and money they pay to play is just as good as yours.<br>
<br>
Just be thankful you had the camp at all, and that someone didn't just walk up to you after you cleared all the way to the camp and said, "Hey, I'm invoking the Vision (tm) of Play Nice Policy.  I'll solo every other rare, your 6 man party can take the other.  If you don't like it, talk to Brad, his rule not mine.  KK thx have a nice day."<br>
<br>
The "We just had to evac" or "We just died, but we were here for the last 10 hours" is utter B.S.  I've seen people in a high level guild back on Sol Ro (that is now on Ayonae) farm the FBSS for over THREE DAYS SOLID 24 hours a day, just rotating members.  One guy I knew personally won 3 FBSS's.  And the POS ass bitched for over an hour on /ooc when the camp was finally taken over cos he finally had to evac.  "But it was my camp... I was there for 3 days..."<br>

I agree if a group is at a camp, they all die, they should have about 10 mins to get back or the camp becomes open, but what ive seen is stupid.<br>
<br>
Was hunting in a full group in Lguk lord and we did a camp check and frenzy was open, we wait about 10 mins and move in and no ones there still, so we set up camp and about 5-10ish mins later a group comes in and says they died and that the camp is theirs, then they go straight into frenzy room and camp only those 3 spawns, they shouted that the group i was in were trying to camp steal and made a huge fuss about it, then they petitioned that they were there first and they died....<br>
a few hours pass and i go LD while i was LD the group leader KSed a mob they were pulling and when i come back i find the GM giving them the camp and telling the group i was in to leave so we did, i dont really disagree with the GM because one of our group leaders did KS them of a kill that was legally the other groups while the GM was there.<br>
<br>
About 30 mins later i was LFG again i did a camp check and, Frenzy was uncamped again so i was wondering why they made such a big fuss about getting their camp back if they were about to leave, so i grab an IVU and headed back down only to find the 5 corpses of the group, the cleric had gated and was in Sro running back, about 30 mins later they got their CR done and died not too long after the CR, they got whiped out about 4 times till they left.<br>
<br>
This is a good example of not being able to hold on to a camp and where it should be given to another group who could actually live longer than 20 mins.<br>
<br>
<br>
But if a group is there, then they all die but their cleric who lived using IVU or camps or whatever and another group moved in 10 secs later, IMO the group who moved in should leave.<br>

Doesn't Verant's rules clearly state that it is not killstealing if they train the mob on you and you kill it?<br>
<br>
If you was in the room between Frenzy and Sentiel, the room to which Frenzy normally is pulled, and the other group was in the actual frenzied room, then I can't see how then could have pulled without training you.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I agree with your general opinion. Claiming rights to a camp long after losing it is just silly. <p>Love, Edeina<br>
