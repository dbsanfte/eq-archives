Aedare, on her way <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   as of now obviously</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> out the door.  The large weathered entry opened with a creak.  A weary and heavy laden traveller came through the doorway, muttering some quick apologies to the vacating Teir'dal and headed for the bar.  Shortly after Aedare left the premises the muscled friend of Casidy's headed out as well perhaps for some fresh air.<br>
<br>
The newly arrived traveller walked <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    or mayhaps lumbered from fatigue</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to a corner table where he relinquished his burden to the ever supporting floor, and like a troll practicing ballet gently slid into a nearby seat.  <br>
<br>
Laughter arose in boistrous manner to some lost joke the young paladins were sharing amongst themselves.  Scaly, turned just at this moment in the young lads direction, just in time to see Casidy trip over one of the outstretched paladin's legs.   This trip resulted in Casidy unexpectedly pitching forward and the contents of her current order envoking vengence upon its weilder.  Born more of reflex than of thought Scaly stood and reached out in time to catch the projectile Casidy, and rescueing her from a certain explosive intimacy with the floor.  <br>
<br>
Regaining her feet Casidy looked up to view her savior, and flushed with assured embarrasment.  &quot;Are you alright miss?&quot;, Scaly said, and quickly grabbed a nearby cloth for which Casidy could clean herself off with.  Two servants rushed to the scene of the crime and began cleaning up the recent mess.  &quot;Perhaps you might want to take a wee break Casidy, get some fresh air, you do look a little tired, tis getting late.&quot;, said Scaly.   <br>
<br>
Casidy smiled and thanked the aging knight and headed to the bar to pick up the replacement liquor.  Scaly smiled in return and began to sit down, realizing that the tavern's attention was briefly on them, his visage flushed scarlet.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Thinking to himself....oh great......the last thing I wanted to do was draw attention to myself.  The last thing I need is someone in with the Militia to recognize who I am.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  With that in mind Scaly began to formulate a simple way to leave the tavern....<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   hopefully</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> as anomonously as possible.<br>
<br>
/ooc   quick /ooc ...in reference to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  aging knight</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->...Scaly is aging in respects of a full life, and not neccesarily of age. Most likely in his 40's which is still young for a Half-elf. <p>Scaly<BR>

<br>
A mere moment latter, she popped down the steps and out the door, but not before grabbing a bottle of the best house mead the inn had to offer.<br>
<br>
He won't even miss this, Casidy smiled to herself. Just before she stepping out the door she cast a sidelong glance at the weary fellow near the hearth, the warm brandy had been exactly what he had been seeking, as he was resting contently at the moment propped in his chair. The 10pp he had given Casidy had been a puzzle indeed.<br>
<br>
She would never refuse a tip. Never. But tips this high normally came with higher expectations. Pondering this briefly, Casidy quickly dismissed the thought and skipped out the door in search for her handsome companion.<br>
<br>
Now where would Qwik be, she thought to herself.<br>
<br>
Ofcourse, he would be beside the big oak, just a bit off in the moonlight, she could just make out the tree. Pulling out her drum, she speed her pace over to the tree. <p><br><b><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#6699cc">

<br>
Figuring now would be as good as a time as any, Scaly began the short trip back to the Hall of Truth to report his &quot;non-findings&quot;.<br>
<br>
No sooner than 3 steps out the door did realization strike Scaly's mind sharper than an Enchanter's clarity or insight.  Mayhaps it was the ale that caused him not to be careful or wary when leaving the inn, but as of now, his mistake for non-secrecy took the form of the 3 burly visages that now stood before him.  News travels fast in Norrath.  &quot;Welcome home Scaly.&quot;, the form in the center said.  Without time to even react Scaly's mind flashed a single thought..<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    ugh....this is gonna hurt</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
With the intention of violence, raw and crude splayed across the faces before him the largest visage dove full strength into Scaly's mid-section, forcing him backwards, pushing harshly and furiously through the Inn's weathered door.<br>
<br>
With the sound of tearing and splintering wood the inn was brought from its jolly escape to a grim reality as a mass of bodies came tumbling through the entryway.  All eyes instantly upon this new spectacle, the warming light of the inn revealed the unmistakable insigna of the Freeport Militia.  Scaly landed hard, his breath knocked from him.  The Militiamen rose leaving the collapsed paladin on the ground.  &quot;Corporal, pick the scum up from the floor and drag his carcass over to the fire.....its time for a little fun.&quot;,spat the one apparently commanding authority here.<br>
<br>
The barkeep wanting none of this shouted, &quot;Take him somewhere else, I don't want any trouble here!  I have customers, this is bad for business!&quot;.  &quot;Shut up, and mind your own!&quot;, barked the leader.  With that the Corporal and the other Militiaman picked up the out of breath knight, and drug him to the fireplace, pushing and kicking aside any patrons that got in their way.<br>

Seeing the soldiers drag a man over to the fireplace, his mind begins to assess the situation.  He also noticed the other patrons, particularly the Paladins, starting to move into action.  Clearly this was not going to end well if something was not done and even then it was suspect.<br>
<br>
For all their intention, the Paladins found themselves struggling to get into motion.  The night of drinking had taken its toll.  They did outnumber the militiamen, but only by a couple.  Any element of surprise they might have used was lost in their commotion.  As the sergeant turned around to investigate, his lips turned up in a grin.  He motioned to his companions to look.  As they did so, he turned back around and landed a solid blow to the jaw of the one lying on the ground.  His eyes glazed over from the blow, but did not shut.<br>
<br>
The sergeant now turned to face the group of Paladins.  &quot;What have we here?  Seems like a bunch of pups want to cause some trouble.&quot;  The two companions began to snicker at the comment.<br>
<br>
The man in green gets up from his chair shaking his head and approaches the center of the open area between them.  &quot;I'd like to ask you to take this outside.  These people don't need to witness bloodshed when they are just trying to relax for the evening.&quot;<br>
<br>
With a snarl, the sergeant barks out, &quot;Shut your face!&quot;  The Paladins stare at the man, but make no comment.<br>
<br>
With a quick fluid movement, the whip is suddenly let loose at the sergeant wrapping around his neck.  A pull brings the sergeant stumbling forward and landing on his knees.  The set of claws quickly brought to point at the fleshy part below the chin.  Turning to the two companions, &quot;Don't move.&quot;  To the sergeant, &quot;You were saying?&quot;<br>
<br>
The sergeant is doing is best to try and just breath at this point.  His face is flushed.  His hands work at the whipcord.  Using the handle of the whip under the chin, the sergeant is brought to his feet.  A quick flick and his purse is cut from his side.  &quot;This should pay for the damage you've caused.  As for you two, see to it your sergeant here gets some rest.  He appears to have taken ill.&quot;  The sergeant is sent flying out the door landing in a heap taking several deep breaths.  The other two rush out to see that he is all right and move him back toward Freeport.<br>
<br>
Turning to the Paladins, the man in green begins to size them up.  &quot;I'd suggest you get this man to your healers.  He'll need some attention, but should be no worse for the wear.  That is, unless you have something else you need to do.&quot;  After a brief pause, the group scurries over and collects the fallen person.  Taking care in moving him, they depart into the night.<br>
<br>
Picking the purse up from the ground, he tosses it onto the bar.  &quot;Let me know if that doesn't cover it.&quot;  He returns to his seat and takes another sip of his brandy. <p><B><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2 COLOR="#3A6EA5">Jzonn Stormwolf &lt;Final Destiny&gt;</B></FONT><BR>

<br>
Softly and soundlessly she sneaks up and throws her arms around his neck, and plants a kiss on his cheek.<br>
<br>
"Hello again, handsome." Casidy said with a smile.<br>
<br>
As she looked in his eyes, she could see that far off look, that meant that he was off on some adventure again, and had left her in mind, if not yet in body. Sighing to herself.<br>
<br>
"Well, it seems you must be leaving me, can I atleast escort you to your destination before you have to finish your tasks dear?" Casidy said softly, trying to contain her disappointment, and failing slightly.<br>
<br>
Qwik Ta'vern held a special place in her heart, but he was called to many tasks and not the settling down sort. Casidy knew this, and had come to accept her place, however limited, within his world.<br>
<br>
"Doll, you know I wouldn't leave you." Qwik said with a wink, "I just need to check in with the guild. And I would love to have you escort me back to town." With that, he wrapped his arms around Casidy's waist and pulled her close planting a kiss, she had so hoped would be on her lips... on her forehead.<br>
<br>
The two walked hand in hand. It was as they headed past the inn, that they heard the loud noises. Watching the interactions of the Militia, and then of the stranger through the side window. Qwik had held Casidy close to him, protecting her from herself, and her overwhelming urge to rush to the aid of the fallen one.<br>
<br>
As the paladins scooped up the aging one to take him to a healer, Casidy and Qwik approached to offer what assistance they could. <br>
<br>
Casidy pulled out her lute, and played a healing song, while Qwik worked with the others to put the wounded man on a flat surface. <br>
<br>
Casting a sidelong glance to the man in green in the corner, Casidy shook her head, this fellow was more and more curious.<br>

Looking up at the attentive duo with a slight smirk, and a wee bit of embarassment he said &quot;Anyone get the /conn of that griffon?&quot;<br>
<br>
One of the young paladins approached, &quot;Sir, are you alright&quot;  &quot;Yes, I will be fine&quot;, Scaly replied.  &quot;You all should get going before the Militia decides to associate you with this.. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  incident</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;, Scaly followed.  &quot;And that goes for you two as well.&quot;, motioning to Casidy and Qwik.

Checking his surroundings, he realized he had wandered this way many times, with many different compatriots, and chuckled to himself that he had been so lost in thought that he might have ended up missing the inn entirely.<br>
<br>
Checking his coinpouch to make sure he had enough to handle the thirst that was quickly building, he moved quickly toward the inn, with enough noise that one might think an entire forge had fallen in upon itself. <p><img src="http://www.concentric.net/~purgon/gilpaint.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=vanlaan>Vanlaan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/13/01 9:23:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://dntsvara.tripod.com/vanlaanpic.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yet another beginning...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> As Drakhnar finished surveying the room, he began to notice that something was missing.

Then he realized what it was that was missing. He turned to his companion at the table and spoke. &quot;Sssir, Vanlaan, your traveling companion appearsss to have traveled on without you, usss.&quot; <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Vanlaan looked around again, expecting to see Aedare come sauntering in, her usual belligerant self.  About that time, all hell broke lose, as one of the patrons was shoved through the Inn's door by several of the corrupt Freeport Militia.  Looked like things might get ugly.  Vanlaan considered summoning up a pet, but then decided to wait a moment and see how things turned out.  He wasn't worried about the Militia bothering him or Aedare.  As Innoruuk's Children, they had nothing to fear from the Militia, since they were corrupt at the hands of the Dark Elves.<br>
<br>
When the commotion didn't produce Aedare, Vanlaan really began to worry.  It was one thing for her to wander outside for a moment, but somehthing else entirely for her to leave him unprotected.  He thought back over the course of the evening, trying to remember if she had said or done anything out of the ordinary.  That was a hard one to pin down... Aedare was anything but ordinary.<br>
<br>
He sighed and turned back to his companion.  The fray seemed to be calming down.  Another patron had interceded on behalf of the beleagured paladin and the milita-men had been routed.  &quot;I'm not going to assume anything concerning Aedare at this point.  We've already paid for rooms for the night and I'm exhausted.  I suggest we stay the night and see if the dawn brings our lost companion back.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vanlaan did one more quick check of the common room and then stood.  &quot;I'm going to bed.  This has been a hectic day and I need to spend some time meditating before I can call it a night.  We'll meet here first thing in the morning.  I look forward to traveling with you, my friend.&quot;  And with that, he turned and made his way to his room. <p><font face="Tahoma" color="#800000"><b>Vanlaan</b></font>

Do not look for me, I will find you.&quot;  And with that Vanlaan headed off to his bunk for the evening.  Drakhnar then sat 2 platinum pieces on the table, enough to pay for the drinks and the service, and begun to weave a spell.  Though the paladins were gone he still could not afford to draw much attention to himself.  Slowly the corner of the room he sat in seemed to grow darker, as if the shadows in the room were all going to that corner.  And if anyone had been watching, which they weren't because they were too busy cleaning up the mess, it would have looked like either Drakhnar was slowly being enveloped by the shadows.   And then, he was gone.  Causiously Drakhnar stood from the table and made his way to the now missing door.  Once outside he stopped and thought for a minute.  Being a cold blooded creature, he couldn't just wrap himself in warm clothes and sleep wherever he wanted like the soft-skins could.  It occured to him that the inn's fireplace was built into an outside wall.  This to him was ideal.  He slowly made his way around the outside of the in and found the bricks that gave away the position of the fireplace.  There he leaned up against the wall and fell asleep, knowing that the fire would die down and the cold would wake him long before any of the soft-skins were out of bed to notice him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/udominicnelson.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dominic nelson</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/17/01 6:08:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yet another beginning...</span><hr size=1> Qwik held no ill feelings towards anyone in general but if there was one thing he couldn't stand it would be stupidity and the milita is the apidimy of it.  Tensing up every last honed muscle in his well trained body Qwik sent a stone cold look to each of the militia men as the made for Freeport.  Qwik was at somewhat of a loss for the boldness of the Militia men in the tavern considering the very dangerious dark ones who seemed to be culminating in the inn of late .. along with several seasoned warriors. Qwik was a man who was not as eloquent with words as he would like but his emotions and actions spoke louder then even Casidy's most prized poem could just the look in his eyes coudl be enough to melt a heart or freeze one in terror.<br>
<br>
taking a breif moment to walk back inside to survey the damage he walked over to the wounded silently and took out a few bandages and bound up what he could . With a consentual nod Qwik stood up and and quietly said "i will return try to stay alive till my return so that we may be properly introduced" with a sly smile he strode out the door just glancing towards Casidy who seemed to be trying to bring the tensions down somewhat and restore order to the inn.<br>
<br>
The night time was always Qwiks favorite time of the day.. there is just something about the unknown .. not knowing whats ahead of you in the path. Such is Qwiks life, no plans no responsibilities other then his own personal agenda but he knew deep down there was something missing .. but he felt so alive just reacting to his emotions, moving on a whim. "One can not live off of wit alone, with out a heart you will cease to exist," and Qwik lived by that thought constantly in his mind... just following his heart and emotions from one moment, to the next.<br>

<br>
Recruiting the help of the fellows still standing around, she helped move the wounded Scaly up to a room where he could rest and recuperate in peace. The gentleman was not one to put to bed easily, but under threat of force, and the wink of her eyes, he did finally consent to rest.<br>
<br>
Heading back to the main room of the tavern, Casidy noticed an odd calm had fallen. Many of the patrons had cleared, infact most of the patrons had cleared.<br>
<br>
Qwik was no where to be seen, and Casidy sighed softly to herself.<br>
<br>
Noticing the kind hearted gentleman still nursing the remnants of his warm brandy, and thinking to thank him, Casidy quickly prepared another warm brandy for him.<br>
<br>
Moving over to his table, glass of her favorite mead in hand, and lute in the other. <br>
<br>
She indicated to the empty chair at the table. "Excuse me good sir, but is this seat taken?"<br>
<br>
Jzonn, raised an eyebrow a bit amused at her quarry, but tilted his head to let her sit.<br>
<br>
"It seems the night has robed me of my companion, and your table seemed wanting for company, would you care to share a tale of a wee bard?" Casidy smiled. She had grown tired of singing for the evening. <br>
<br>
And this gentleman had been far to quiet, especially considering how quickly he had dispatched the militia, or atleast Jaris, the barkeep had explained it as being quick. Jaris was one for exaggeration, but still, this one was intriguing to Casidy.<br>
<br>
Sitting back in her chair, and sipping her mead, she awaited his reply.<br>

<br>
As the dark elf made his weary way to his room, the door to the inn flew open, letting the rain that commonly assaulted the Commonlands blow in.  In the doorway stood the squat form of a bronze-armored dwarf, his eyes filled with rage beneath the green scarab helm.  The axe clutched tightly in his hands was almost twice as large as he was.<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  DARK ELF!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot; he bellowed.  &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  I've finally tracked you down!

Ye and yer woman... ye were hiding out in the Plague Village, and my friend takes pity on ye.

I don't think I've ever heard a name similar to that in all my travels through the lands of the Elves.  I am called Jzonn and it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.<br>
<br>
&quot;You wish a tale, do you?  Let me think about this.  I don't relay tales in the way of the Bards, but I know a story or two.  Perhaps I should tell you of a friend of old...a Bard himself who seemed to find trouble in most interesting ways.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jzonn smiles in a way to indicate he is recalling a memory.  &quot;I know just the tale.  Druevan, the Bard in question, and I were sitting in a place named The Storm's Retreat.  He was absently playing his lute to pass the time and both of us were drinking some Surefall Rum.  All of a sudden, Drue's eyes light up.  He stands up and exclaims, 'I've got it!'  As I turn to look at him...&quot;<br>
<br>
The make-shift door used to replace the recently shattered one is loudly opened, nearly knocking it off the frame.  A Dwarf is standing in the doorway, the water dripping off his stout frame.  Behind him, the rains are coming down and apparantly started unbeknownst to the patrons in the inn.<br>
<br>
&quot;DARK ELF!&quot; the Dwarf bellowed.  &quot;I've finally tracked you down!  Now, give me my ring or ye'll have yer head shoved up yer privates!&quot;  The Dwarf is clearly talking to the Dark Elf sitting on the side of the room, though the Dark Elf shows some signs of confusion about him.<br>
<br>
Jzonn sighs.  &quot;It appears to be a night for interruptions, Casidy.  I guess I should have known better than to expect some quiet time, but I'm not really in the mood to stop another brawl.  You may as well take this time to retire for the evening.  Perhaps I can finish the tale over coffee and breakfast tomorrow.&quot;  Jzonn raises his eyebrow inquiringly. <p><B><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2 COLOR="#3A6EA5">Jzonn Stormwolf &lt;Final Destiny&gt;</B></FONT><BR>

Knowing that there was only one dark elf in there, he instantly sprung to his feet and in a flash was watching from the shadows just outside the door to the inn, waiting for the dwarf to make a move.  Drakhnar had given Vanlaan his word that he would defend him and help him....and he was nothing if he did not keep his word.   As he waited, he slowly reached into his belt pack with his left hand and removed a hand full of bone chips.  Calmly he waited, hand poised to cast the spell which would summon his pet.  And with his right hand he drew his dagger and with serpentine grace he cast a spell causing his hand to glow with violent energy, ready to drain the life from his enemy with the first strike.  This dwarf, should he choose battle, would know the true meanings of Fear and Hate.  And Father Thule would be proud. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uliandriana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Liandriana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Regular Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(2/3/01 12:13:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/yezud/spada.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yet another beginning...</span><hr size=1> Liandriana briskly walked down the narrow path on her way to freeport, keeping a look out for the militia.  Even though it was pitch black she could still see as it was day.  A nifty trick she was taught to summon a stone that gave her eyesight ultravision.<br>
<br>
She caught sight of three lurking bodies hurridly moving along the road.  She paused and squinted to see them better, just her luck militia men.  Rage built up inside her as she channeled the elements of earth into her focus.  She still had much contempt and hate, even as great of Innoruuk towards these militia men.  They would all pay for the night they stole her innocence.<br>
<br>
Infront of her the dirt on the ground rose to form a globular mass of earth and grass.  It had taken shape to above her height, this element would do her bidding in dispaching the milita men.  Yes, they would suffer.<br>
<br>
Channeling more power into the elemental it's body pulsed with a greenish glow as it almost seemed to go insane from it's beserken state.  She then conjured the elements of fire to surround the earthen mass with a blazing lava shield.  Her 'pet' was now ready to unleash her hate to the milita men.<br>
<br>
Again she channeled the elements of fire into the form of lava, slowly building it's power as she narrowed her eyes onto one of the militia men.  The heat from the fire she conjured burned intense until it was finally a molten ball of lava which she aimed at the man she stared at.  She pushed air into the lava and sent the bolt away.  The lava melted one of the pathetic souls into nothingness as the other two men stood there in confusion.<br>
<br>
The glob of earth suddenly jerked towards the two men standing in stupidity, they raised there swords to fend it off.  Only to be surprised as lava spewwed towards them as they slashed violentally towards the elemental.  One of the lesser men died quickly by his futile attempts at shashing only brought more lava gushing onto him.<br>
<br>
Liandriana grinned with a maddness as the second one fell, only one remaining and it would feel her full wrath.  She channeled fire into the man over and over, igniting his skin only leaving a charred remain of him.  She walked up to the... globs and spat at them.<br>
<br>
She felt slightly relieved, yet still obsessed. There was more to pay... yes, she had to see to that... the militia men would not have fun as long as she was around. <p><i><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=17311">Liandriana Sedai</a> -55Conjurer <br><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=24077">Syui Chan</a> -52Disciple</i><br>Officer of Destiny - Ayonae Ro</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/udominicnelson.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dominic nelson</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(2/6/01 9:06:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yet another beginning...</span><hr size=1> Finally ... stomach settled from visiting his mentor .. relief flashed across his face as he headed out of Freeport.<br>
