<br>
Some love it, some hate it. You can find flaws with both.<br>
<br>
Personally, I am glad we have the system we have. <br>
<br>
A perfect example was last Wednesday.<br>
<br>
I woke up with my left eye swollen. When I got to the office, I picekd up the phone, dialed my eye doctor and made an appointment. 20 mins after I hung up the phone, I left the for the 10 min drive to his office. 15 mins in the waiting room and I was examined and diagnosed. Paid the bill, left, and was back at the office in another 10 mins.<br>
<br>
Total time for treatment - less than an hour portal to portal.<br>
Total cost - 60 bucks (haven't met my deducatble yet this year ;p )<br>
<br>
The system works for me.<br>
<br>
The biggest downsides I see cited for a system like you find in Canada are the waiting times for no life threatening afflictions and the higher taxes needed to pay for the system.<br>
<br>
The downside for what we have in the US - increased cost when you need to use it.<br>
<br>
For me (I see a doctor maybe 2-3 times a year), the tax and time savings are worth it. <br>
<br>
It just seems that a public healthcare system would encourage folks to run to a doctor for every hangnail they might get. Why not? It's free.<br>
<br>
Also, some doctors tend to move south of the border since they can make more money here. <br>
<br>
I'll stick with what we have, but if you are happy with how yours is, more power to you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The main reason I had come back to this thread was because the LA riots were being named and racism.<br>
<br>
Alot of the Rodney King incident was left unsaid by the media and help fuel peoples ire.<br>
<br>
Here's a run down...<br>
<br>
There was a pursuit on the Foothill Freeway. The guy tried to get away. When he finally stopped, he got out of the car and tried to take on the whole force.<br>
<br>
March 1991: An amateur videotape shows LAPD officers clubbing and kicking Rodney King, who is black. <br>
<br>
April 1992: A jury acquits three of the officers involved in the beating. There were no black jurors. <br>
<br>
April 1992: The verdict sparks riots, destroying much of South Central LA. Fifty-four people are dead, over 2,000 are injured. The estimated damage totals $900 million. <br>
<br>
During the riots, another brutal attack is captured on tape and televised. Reginald Denny, a white truck driver, is severely beaten by rioters. <br>
<br>
Now....<br>
<br>
Different versions of the tape: Most of America saw an edited version of the amateur videotape. Jurors in the officers' trial saw an additional 13 seconds, in which King charged the officers. This version fueled the jurors' decision to acquit. <br>
<br>
KTLA people gave the tape unedited to the police department because they wanted to make sure that it was authentic, and the police confirmed it. And then they put on in their newscast 68 seconds of this 81 seconds. The first 3 seconds are critical because they show Mr. King lunging in the direction of Officer Laurence Powell, who then responds with this baton blow. <br>
<br>
It's brutal in any version, but the first three seconds that were omitted by the television station are a window into all of the things that have happened before the videotape begins. So what the viewer is seeing is a partial record of a partial record. [The King incident began with a 7.8 mile car chase conducted by California Highway Patrol officers, one of whom drew a gun on King before the LAPD took over.] <br>
<br>
Rodney King had done all of these things before the videotape - He'd resisted the officers, he'd charged the officers, he'd thrown four officers off his back, he'd been shot twice with a stun gun, which keeps most people down. 50,000 volts of electricity each time, it didn't keep him down. This was a case where a great effort was made to take Rodney King into custody without hurting him, believe it or not. <br>
<br>
Gotta love when the media prechews the news and fuels the fire.<br>

<br>
Abaraham - I like you, your as patriotic as i am. And continue to make fair points (good ones too) for your side of the argument.  However you always seem to finish your posts off with something rude and unnecessary.  Bashing another country or calling Canada a Shithole for instance.  I mean come on, i know an American guy from my college who moved only 20 miles from where i live in england.  When i asked why he left America, his exact words were... &quot;Because it's a Shithole man&quot;  <br>
<br>
America is not a Shithole, Canada is not a shithole.  Europe is not a Shithole.  They are all just different lumps of rock on the same globe.  <br>
<br>
Aulora - Wow great post, couldn't have said it better myself.  There is no such thing as a &quot;best&quot; country and there never will be (never was for that matter) Had any one of you americans been born in a European country you would be on the other side of the argument. It's called Patriocism and in my opinion is very healthy (until people take it to the extreme)<br>
<br>
Every country has it's faults... Yes America too.. Yes my country England has them too. We all have them. Just as we all have things about our countries to be proud of.  But... theres no sense in pointing out time and time again another countries faults, without acknowledging your own too. (This is definately not directed just at Americans but at some of the European posters here also... it works both ways)<br>
<br>
Half my family lives in America, the other half in England.  When either half visits the other all we do is complain about how bad things are where we live.  Yes the Americans are complaining about how bad it is in America to the british side of the family...and Vice versa.<br>
<br>
<br>
OooOo while i am at it... Another thing for you Abraham,  you continually mention that Europeans don't like to work. Come on man, you really cant judge a whole continent on a couple of bad experiences with some European branches of your company.  Theres plenty of bad experiences people have with americans too. I for one dont judge a country...let alone a continent on the behavious of a few of it's citizens.<br>
<br>
Anyways... i think it's about time i logged in and played some EQ.  I'll see all you cousins of mine from accross the pond in game.<br>
<br>
BTW... I hate Tea, i don't ride a horse, i sure as hell don't say toodle pip.  Thanks US Media :-)<br>

It isn't just me, plenty of other people I talk with have the same experiences.  Pretty damn funny, buddy of mine got frustrated as hell with some lazy Italians, and he was told that he needs to respect their "cultural differences."<br>
<br>
Europeans value leisure time more than Americans do.  But then they whine when America is further ahead because of our hard work.<br>
<br>
If you want to play a part in how the world is shaped, get in there and get your hands dirty, otherwise STFU and let America keep the bad man at bay.<br>

Alot of medditeranean countries have what they call a Siesta... they sleep in the afternoon due to the unbareable heat in the summer.  Maybe that accounted for the Lazy Italian perception.  Maybe i;m totally wrong and you are correct.  But i know that in England we aren't lazy.  The average person here does just as many hours a week as any American would... and as you put it earlier gets down to it and works overtime when the job requires it.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for the second point you made... That's not really a fair comparison,  i was meaning there is no best out of the western countries.  I would NOT like to live in Iraq hehe :-) if you judge best by technology then Japan gets my vote.  If you judge best by &quot;most fun&quot; then Holland is up there. (not fun for everyone though im sure) If you judge best by largest Military, then its america.  If you judge best by best army for their size, i would say england.  <br>
<br>
My point was that each country has their good points and bad points.  There are so many ways you can judge &quot;best&quot; what makes a country best to one person might make it awful to live in for another.  Every man to their own as the saying goes.<br>

In Europe there is more negotiation over how much vacation time a person receives than there is over salary.  Compare American vacation time to European vacation time, you will note a significant difference. <p><img src = "http://www.concentric.net/~gandalfh/BixieSig.jpg" width = 199 height = 136>

I would like to make a few points.<br>
<br>
First, the United States of America is the premier country in the world in more categories than any other.  Our military is second to none.  Our economy is second to none, lest I remind everyone why exactly the Germans did not take over Europe entirely, Industrial Might in the good ole US.  Our industrial prowess turned the war by building a bigger better war machine.  Can the US or the Euros survive economically without the other, not well.  Our cultural icons are the most recognized throughout the world, i.e McDonald's, Disney, hell you know them.<br>
<br>
Second, the United States like it or not is the world leader.  We take the lead.  We are the ones the world rallys behind.  We consistently send the most troops, provide the most weapons, SPEND THE MOST MONEY.  What do you think our domestic social programs would be like if we discontinued supporting all these other countries and applied that money here?  What do you think would happen to the millions of people who rely on food and medicine from the United States if we stopped sending it?<br>
<br>
Third, what I read from the Bush press conference was that the United States was not going to continue peacekeeping and doing the UN work with that farce of a court having juristiction over Americans.  We pay the bills (money, troops, weapons, leadership) so we make the rules.  If you don't like it then thats too bad.  Who is most responsible for shaping this modern mostly peaceful world over the past 50 years?  Umm, the United States.<br>
<br>
Fourth, I firmly agree with Bush on this.  I personally believe that we should tell the world they can have their court and police the world on their own or pay the price we set (American exemption) for us continuing to police the world.  It all boils down to whether the world wants to pay the price we set for our services.  Take it or leave it.<br>
<br>
I am sure most of you live in nice happy countries that I really would like to visit sometime.  I think most countries have wonderful things that make them a treasure to their populations.  But in this age of mankind, the United States is the premier country in the world and everyone else is a step or many steps behind.  Hence the term &quot;superpower&quot; is only applied to the United States now.<br>
<br>
I think we all can agree it is nice to live in a relatively peaceful world instead of a world at war such as we had in the 40's.<br>
<br>

Take a look at the Innovations England has made, from both a scientific and military standpoint.  And of course a political one. Most of the western world is based on what was the English system, then fine tuned and much improved my America... which we in turn adopted the improvements.  Like it or not England along with most other European countries have done alot for the world :-)<br>

Our system encourages innovation, encourages people to get a better job with better health benefits, allows you the CHOICE to see whatever doctor you want to see. Downsides are the costs. That is the Only downside i see. As far as economies go all of europe banding together still cannot overcome americas dominance. Hell I bet the state of Californias economy is almost as large as any european county ( no fact just a guess though i do seem to remember hearing it would be the 5th largest economy in the world on its own). And lets not even get into how we dominate popular culture. Shit i cant even remember the last non American film I have seen that was wortth a shit. Bottom line is, and no amount of whining or bitching or debating is gonna change the fact the ther is only ONE superpower left.

Cultural achivements which are know all over the world would be Tour d' Eiffel, Louvre, Piccaso, Golden Gate Bridge, etc. just to name a few I can think on top of my head, from Europe &amp; the USA. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Something I read in almost every post which stands for the leading position of America is the military power. Is this point for you Americans <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> that</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> important?<br>
