His mouth parched with the kind of dryness that came from an excessive, thirst quenching night before. Yet, he felt a smile on his face. <br>
<br>
What in all the Gods names was he thinking of last night when he accepted a drinking challenge from a Troll. For all his drinking prowess, some would say dwarvish pride, and confidence in outdrinking any mortal being, he knew better than to take on the likes of such creatures as these - being part mortal and part evil incarnate. <br>
<br>
But here he was, a shadowy memory of the previous night slowly coalescing in his head as he raised himself off the ground. Walking out the front of the Tavern, in front of him lay a trough, the last dregs of morning fog rolling off its watery surface. <br>
<br>
Jarg plunged his head deep below the surface and welcomed the sharp pain of the ice cold water as it stabbed like a thousand tiny knives into his leathery face. He pulled his head sharply out, flinging his long braided hair back.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, he felt an all to familiar jab at his back. <br>
<br>
There was no mistaking the thrust of a blade and he naturely rolled away and to the offside of the thrust as it slid harmlessly off his ringmail tunic. Thrusting his hand out, his fingers stiff as steel, Jarg reflexively aimed for the closest thing to a throat he could see. He was not disappointed. <br>
<br>
He felt the crumble of tissue and saw the horror in his assailant's face as his fingers dug deep into the throat of a Rogue halfling. The small figure falling to the ground, his lasts breaths wheezing through a crushed larynx. <br>
<br>
Jarg slid his dagger once into a small spot just below and behind the halfling's earlobe ensuring the tricksters death - ironically a move taught to him by a more friendly rogue years ago in a land far away from Firona Vie. All was clear now as the last remnants of groginess disappeared with the adrenaline rush of the attack and Jarg looked over his would be assasin more closely.<br>
<br>
The face was familiar although young, someone he saw last night in the Tavern, but he had not talked directly to this halfling. He remembered the troll and his braggart ways and laying a wager on its drinking prowess. Jarg as the challenger accepted Grog as the drink of choice and the competition ensued. <br>
<br>
After almost five hours of non-stop flaggons of Grog, the troll suddenly keeled over spewing Grog into the air as he fell. After laying immobile for almost an hour, inspection from a nearby Cleric found the troll to be dead. He remembered the look of awe in the eyes of those around him and, yes now he remembered, the look of anger and hate in others. <br>
<br>
This halfling had been one of the angry ones. Having cursed Jarg and the losses he had incurred. Jarg remembered brushing the youth off because of his age. A mistake he would never make again. <br>
<br>
Had Jarg treated the halfling's insults as he normally would, the rogue would have died the night before. The next unfortunate youth would now pay that price without hesitation.<br>
<br>
Wagers had been hard and heavy during the drinking session and Jarg suddenly noticed the heavy weight on his hip. Opening his coin bag, he found close to a thousand Platinum pieces clinking against each other noisily. But why had this rogue waited till now to attack him? Walking slowly back into the Tavern the answer came clearly into view. Along the walls were the obvious symbols and wards of the users of magic. The Tavern was protected from pickpockets and acts of violence magically, its popularity now clearly evident.<br>
<br>
Jarg walked slowly toward the bar, noticing the bartender gently wiping the counter with a soft cloth. <br>
<br>
&quot; I see ya had a bit o' adventure bright an early this morning,&quot; said the bartender. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, it seems I have helped two souls to the other side these past few hours,&quot; offered Jarg.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, they were deserving I am sure. I can tell ye are from the salt of the earth my dwarf friend.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jarg shrugged and wiped his beard with his hand, the aching in his head long gone and a familiar thirst now returning to his mouth. Licking his lips, he leaned forward squinting at the kegs lining the wall behind the bartender. <br>
<br>
&quot; Would you have a drink befitting the mourning of two more lost souls sent on their way to Hell?&quot;<br>
<br>
The bartender laughed out loud, a warm and friendly laugh, &quot; Aye my friend, I would and I promise you- for your sake as well as mine- it won't be Grog...&quot; <br>
