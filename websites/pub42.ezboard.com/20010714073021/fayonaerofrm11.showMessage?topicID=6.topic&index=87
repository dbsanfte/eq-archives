&quot;Rumors of War Unfounded&quot;</center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Antonius Bayle issued a statement recently saying that the widespread rumors of war due to the plague unleashed on the Plains of Karana are unfounded. &quot;Though we believe we know the identity of the perpetrators of this terrible crime I must urge all citizens to exercise calm. We are civilized people ruled by law. Thus we must follow the rule of law and not allow ourselves to resort to vigilante justice.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vegalys Keldrane told The Times that the matter was still under investigation. He assured us that the perpetrators would be brought to justice. He too urged citizens to remain calm.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><center> &quot;Food Shortages Cause Merchants Concern&quot;</center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
<br>
A poor harvest and damaged crops are leaving some merchants short on certain baked goods. Karn Tassen, local merchant, had this to say about the food shortage.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is hard enough to scrape by and make enough money to pay your taxes in this town. Now with this blasted plague effecting everthing, I'm starting to run out of stock. It's a mess I tell you!&quot;<br>
<br>
A call has gone out to independent bakers to assist our local merchants and those abroad in keeping their supplies properly stocked. Anyone interested in assisting the community in this time of need should inquire of local members of the Merchants of Qeynos. Those traveling abroad are urged to contact members of the Coalition of Tradefolk. <br>
<br>

&quot;Hand of Bertoxxulous Reaches Across of Norrath&quot;</center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
The plague unleashed across the Karana plains by the Bloodsabres several weeks past has finally reached its venomous hand to our portside city. Provisions have been growing steadily scarce due to the lack of necessary materials to make bread, muffins, and other goods needed by the citizens and travelers alike.<br>
<br>
One of our prospering merchants, Innkeep Huntor, has expressed his concern with this shortage of certain products. &quot;Although we still have plenty of rations, the production of our most fine of goods has been harmed due to the plague upon the Karana fields. We have fear that the demand for these foods shall grow greatly, but our supply will only decrease to an eventual and severe lack in these goods.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><center> &quot;Runnyeye Citadel Reclaimed&quot;</center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
We have heard rumors from our merchants and tradesmen who frequent the Highpass area, that the goblin miners of Runnyeye citadel have overthrown the Evil Eyes that have enslaved them for several years. The goblins have retaken the citadel as their own, and appointed a new leader with the execution of their former king, who was beneath the Evil Eye's control.<br>
<br>
There is little direct meaning of this event to the citizens of Freeport beyond the possibility of a compromised safety for the merchants who frequent Highpass Keep, as the Pickclaw clan of goblins remain there as members of a free civilization. We merely look back upon the history that led the corruption of Kithicor Wood and the influence the goblins had in that massacre.<br>

Baker Gretta Mottle, a lovely lass she be, has recently agreed to set up shop in Tumpy Irontoe's fine pub. You'd be sad to hear that she lost several crates of her bakin' goods durin' the move to Kaladim from Freeport.<br>
<br>
Her assistant is sure he saw the crates come off the boat. What happened to 'em from there, he don't be knowin'. Gretta be offerin' a handsome reward for the return of her crates.<br>

&quot;Upheaval in Runnyeye&quot;</center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
The upheaval in Runnyeye Citadel has caused a great deal of panic amongst the citizens of Rivervale. Clan Pickclaw battled its way through the dwellings defeating the inhabitants, the evil eyes and goblin slaves of Xorbb.<br>
<br>
Lord Pickclaw personally personally executed the Goblin King and his minions, and integrated the remaining Runnyeye goblins into his clan. While most were slain in battle, including Borxx, the remaining evil eyes fell back to the Gorge of King Xorbb.<br>
<br>
After tghe battle was won, Lord Pickclaw struck a deal with a strange subterranean race of fungal beings called the Sporali. The Sporali would do mining work for the goblins, and in return, the goblins wouldn't wipe them out.<br>
<br>
Apparently, Lord Pickclaw and his followers had been hidden away for several years building up forces.<br>

<br>
Helping to fight against the plague in the Karanas, our bakers rush to find new recipes each day.<br>
<br>
One of our key reportes was met with an untimely death while trying to spread the news of the new recipes.<br>
<br>
Hobie Mullins deemed himself an ambassador of baking. While trying to improve the quality of life amongst the ogres and trolls of the swampy land of Innothule, Hobie was eaten by a ferocious ogre reporter of Da Swamp News after he gave the beast the recipe for Muskie Marinade and some journalistic advice.<br>
<br>
In memory of Hobie, we have included the recipe that he was trying to share to the world.<br>
<br>
Ingredients: Rathe Muskie, Vinegar, Spices, Snake Egg Oil, Fish Wine<br>
<br>
Create the marinade by mixing the liquid ingredients. Allow the Muskie to marinade for several hours. Add spices and cook until skin is golden brown and meat appears lightly translucent.<br>

&quot;That Whis is Sacred&quot;</center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
Several days past, our princess and divine Champion, Firiona Vie, amde a plea to our High Priest of Tunare for the creation of the four sacred stones of nature. The elves of Tunare have had little need for there stones since our migration from Tunaria, but The Priests of Tunare have kept such rituals sacred and within the archives of documented rituals.<br>
<br>
Abiding most graciously to Firiona's request, Yeolam Bronzeleaf set immediately to work on the four-day ritual that would produce the stones requested. The days have passed and the stones have been completed. Now we wait patiently and with the greatest of hope that Tunare's Champion shall be successful in her need for these sacred stones.<br>

The people of Qeynos have cried out for blood and the rumors of war have glided through the Karana air as a bitter, screeching horn played by the inept.<br>
<br>
Antonious Bayle IV, ruler of Qeynos and the Karana Plains, has called for an immediate silence to the painful rumors of blood and battle.<br>
<br>
The young, zealous ruler demanded that all remain in peace and that he will do all within his power to see that war does not come to his kingdom so long as he remains upon the throne. The people have since given to their sovereign's just rule and returned to their daily routines.<br>

&quot;Goblin Home Liberated&quot;</center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
In an effort to bring you news both above and below the surface of Norrath, we have recieved a report of a quiet war that broke out between the goblins known as the &quot;Pickclaws&quot; and those of &quot;Clan Runnyeye&quot;. A goblin calling himself Lord Pickclaw apparently lead the rebellion.<br>
<br>
The Runnyeye clan and the Pickclaws split when a monsterous Evil Eye by the name of Xorbb used his terrible powers of the mind to enslave, coerce and otherwise much around with the goblins, eventually taking over Runnyeye Citadel. Many escaped during this time and relocated under the Serpent Spine mountains. They have been a thorn in the side of the humans of High Keep ever since. They called themselves the Pickclaws due to their interests in mining.<br>
<br>
Lord Pickclaw and his army rolled easily over the goblins of Runnyeye Citadel and he personally executred the former Goblin King and even, it is said, the Evil Eye known as Borxx. It was also reported that this &quot;Lord Pickclaw&quot; struck a deal with a race of fungus creatures called the sporali, whereby Lord Pickclaw would agree not to kill them in return for their mining ore for him.<br>
<br>

Yeolam Bronzeleaf, Priest of Tunare, has reported that he has completed the creation of the stones required by princess Firiona Vie. The stones will be used in a ritual whereby the princess will attempt to summon the power of Tunare to seek guidance for the recovery of the artifact staff, known as The Lifeguide, that was given to her by The Mother of All. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm11.showMessage?topicID=28.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm11.emailToFriend?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm11.threadControl?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm11.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=6.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm11.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=6.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Diplomacy Corner<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Administration Corner<option value="ayonaerofrm11">Fight the Plague!</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm11>Fight the Plague!</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-553273-677484" target="_blank" >
