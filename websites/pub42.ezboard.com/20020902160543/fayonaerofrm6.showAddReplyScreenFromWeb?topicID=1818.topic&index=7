<br>
Two very bad ideas, IMHO<br>
Like Byliment said, castration doesn't work. Abuse is more about power then about sex, and there are many ways to commit abuse without getting a erection. By the way, don't forget that women can abuse as well.<br>
<br>
Also, in a civilized society it is like this:<br>
<br>
*Laws are made by democratically elected politicians<br>
*The law is upheld by a juridical system that is separate from the political system. <br>
<br>
The politicians don't get to enforce the rules they make, and angry mobs sure as hell doesn't get the chance.<br>
<br>
Publishing registers of suspected or convicted criminals is a very bad idea, especially when it comes to crimes where a lynchmob is likely to form and take the law into it's own hands.  <p>Love, Edeina<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot;Abuse is more about power then about sex, and there are many ways to commit abuse without getting a erection. By the way, don't forget that women can abuse as well.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I stand corrected on that front.<br>
<br>
In regards to allowing public knowledge of paedophiles, I DO think it a must that if a convicted child molestor is released back into society, then those who live in close proximity of said offender's locale should be made aware of the presence of these criminals. I think it would be extremely irresponsible of any legal system to keep the existence of a known paedophile a secret from the surrounding families. <br>
<br>
In relation to &quot;Cardinal Law&quot; or whomever the original post is in relation to, I must say that I am not a U.S citizen, so I'm unaware of the laws/procedures involved with the treatment of child molestors. In Australia, where I was born and bred, we've recently had a media frenzy concerning a convicted paedophile. The offender was a Catholic priest and the concern was that the Catholic Church was seemingly attempting to give a monetary pay-out to the family of the victim in exchange for media silence. The story is no longer covered in the media, and no satisfactory outcome was achieved.<br>
<br>
Perhaps, as you say, giving out the names and photos of paedophiles is a dangerous proposition. I think, though, that at the very least those who live in close proximity of said offender should be aware of his presence. Protecting the identity from those that live near the offenders is irresponsible. <br>

Protecting children from potential pedophiles is, of course, important. And I don't think convicted pedophiles should ever be allowed to work with children professionally. And maybe the local police should be notified to keep extra attention.<br>
<br>
However, making the identity public would make it impossible for the person to ever get a normal life, and it is very likely to end in murder or attempted murder. This is bad in any case, but extra serious considering that many convicted &quot;pedophiles&quot; have later proven to be innocent. Little Rascals, anyone? <p>Love, Edeina<br>

<br>
(DISCLAIMER: This probably will be offensive to any Catholics, and there's always exceptions to everything, but this is my opinion. If you are easily offended, I suggest skipping this post, especially if you're Catholic, but this IS the NAG forum, right? I'm not bashing Catholics, by the way. If you are happy in following your faith, all the more power to you, just please don't bleed your faith all over me too. I'm agnostic, and will stay that way until I'm damn good and ready to commit myself to any religion, IF ever.)<br>
<br>
You have been warned.<br>
<br>
Firstly, I was raised in an unorthodox, but relatively strict Roman Catholic family, which has many many equally Catholic friends which I've met many of at parties and such. Upon living like that for pretty much 15 years (I'm 18, actually, but the first 3 years of my life were quite different. This isn't about my life story, so I'll skip to the point) and have come up with 2 conclusions:<br>
<br>
1. For the most part, 85% of the Catholics I've met are very stupid, gullible, and interestingly enough, unhappy people. Easily fooled, easily taken advantage of, and seem to be overall, quite stupid.<br>
<br>
2. Christians in general are HORRIBLY closed minded, and are not very worldly people. They are quite ignorant of many things, and seem to grasp many basic concepts of civility MUCH slower.<br>
<br>
The above observation was most strongly proved to me by being pretty much forced into a Catholic school from 5th-10th grade, upon which I was kicked out for knocking some snot-nosed bastard kid out with a paint can and wood flail I was boredly making during recess out of boredom. When I went back to public school the year later, I was almost astounded by how much more mature my peers there were, as well as the quality of the education. Of course, this might've just been the schools, and probably isn't a proper experiment, but it sure as hell is NOT a good impression. Oh, and I hated school, by the way, in both places... =P<br>
<br>
Pedophiles in the Catholic church? Whoodathunkit!!?? With the people who practice this religion? Be happy it's not WORSE than it is! Especially with a religion plagued with death. The inquisition, the crusades, come on, now. This is small shit compared to what Catholics, and really, Chrisitians as a whole have done to people before.<br>
<br>
Faith harms, whether people like to believe it or not, because the church, and their god was created by people, and people are stupid (sorry for the shamless MIB reference.) It's a fact proved time and time again by history, and even modern day. Look at what happened on 9/11, for example. Political and religious extremists kill thousands of people in the name of God. God kills more people than AIDS at this rate, so why are you all surprised that there's pedophiles in the church?<br>
<br>
Christianity sure does look good on paper. Just love, and care about your fellow man and the world'll be a better place, and you'll have a nice cozy apartment in heaven, and won't suddenly poof during Judgement Day©. Of course, how many people actually practice it that way? The church has been convulted over the centuries by humanity.<br>
<br>
And you're worried about pedophiles? Shit, I'm more worried about these priests strapped uzis and killing Wiccans and other people who practice New Age religions in the name of Jesus.<br>
<br>
My solution? Bury the church. It's long outstayed it's welcome, and the people it hurts FAR outnumbers the people it helps. You say Christianity is the most widespread religion? Well, shit, it probably helped that back in the day, all the people that practiced OTHER religions were killed. I don't BLAME them for converting, I'd be scared shitless of a bunch of missionaries with swords and maces trying to kill me because I pissed in a non-Catholic outhouse. Really funny yet, is how Christianity started as a very oppressed religion that the Roman empire killed people regularly over for practicing it rather than worshipping their gods.<br>
<br>
Way to be hypocritical.<br>
<br>
So, yeah, I'm not worried about pedophiles in church. There's a fuck load MORE to be frightened about in there... <p>-------------------------------

Especially since the Church knew about what was going on and allowed them to keep doing it by instead of punishing the offenders they just transferred em to give the person the opportunity to do it over and over again.<br>

<br>
However, there are always multiple sides to each story.....<br>
<br>
Most churches preach forgiveness.  They teach you to get along and be kind to everyone.   How would it look if a church came forward and said  &quot;Hey, all that stuff we taught you?  Screw it.  Nuke these guys.  Even though, you know, they've spent the majority of their lives in service to us.  We think God would like them to sit in prison and be ass-raped.&quot;<br>
<br>
There's a church people would love. <br>

I just re-read my own post, and realized I did a very bad misstake. I wrote &quot;pedophiles&quot; where I meant &quot;child molesters&quot;. That's not the same thing, of course. A childmolester is someone who actually DO abuse children, regardless of if it arouse him or if it's cruelty for crueltys own sake. (Like I said before, the evil of it all is more often then not the point itself rather then a side effect, when it comes to rape.)<br>
<br>
A pedophile is someone who would get aroused by abusing children. But a sane pedophile isn't much different from a unlucky guy who gets attracted to grownup women who are not interested in having sex with him. A pedophile who isn't also a rapist/molester is simply a unlucky guy who never get the sex he desire. The problem with pedohilia isn't really those people, but the psychopaths and the psychos. Psychopaths who gladly get their pleasure at the expense of others, and psychos who live in their own twisted dreamworlds and actually believe things like that prepubecent children are interested in having intercourse and are attracted to them. Bleah, such creeps are scary. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Love, Edeina<br>
