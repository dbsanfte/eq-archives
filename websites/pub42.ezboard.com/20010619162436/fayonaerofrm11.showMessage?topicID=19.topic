There is &quot;an erudite traveller&quot; with an enchanter pet at the south end of the lake in Qeynos Hills (near where Hadden spawns). When hailed by myself, dwarf warrior with whatever natural Erudin faction I have, he responded that he was not feeling well and I should leave him alone. He spoke terrible common, perhaps he must be hailed in Erudite and by an Erudite? He cons green at 36 and supposedly has no faction when killed. Its a thought that he has the Plauge, and perhaps a cure can be found?<br>
<br>
2. There is a NEW NPC in Befallen, if you fall down the well (remember to get keys or gate out), take the right hand passage and you will find him lying on the floor. I couldn't get him to respond to hails other than the default &quot;get lost&quot; message due to apprehensive faction, but others got him to say this:<br>
<br>
Lino Jinglebelly struggles to raise his head, obviously in pain. He says, 'help......meeee......I'm....trapped.....[spirits]....'<br>
<br>
(that is exact, right down to the periods)<br>
<br>
Nothing further was gotten out of him, and the high lvl rogue and enchanter scraped the bottom of the dictionary on him. When killed he has 1hp and has a smite type spell that hits for 3 dmg or so, he also casts yaulp. No factions, no loot except whatever you give him (we tried that too, including a full set of befallen keys and a bandage). When he dies, this message appears:<br>
<br>
Lino Jinglebel's corpse  falls to the ground and begins to fade, apparently wisked away to some other plane by an outside force<br>
<br>
And then he repops within 1 second, and lays down again. He casts Yaulp sometimes and stands for a while. His body has normal decay rate, it doesn't get wisked away or anything. It is just creepy, if you want you can stand there and smack him till you turn blue in the face.<br>
<br>
Thoughts: perhaps someone in Rivervale with a similar name is looking for him? I may investigate this end tomorrow. Tired now hehe and gonna sleep on it. Very strange. Last thought is that since he isn't feeling good, perhaps he has the Plague?<br>
<br>
Oh before I forget, the rogue got a GM to show up and try and help (in case Lino was &quot;broken&quot;) and the GM honestly hadn't a clue what we needed to say to him but said he was NOT broken. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=505050><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uajram.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ajram</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/3/01 8:25:33 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://tod.newportnet.com/kitt/b.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> how bout another.. while I am awake</span><hr size=1> oh hey lets add...<br>

3. Today I happened to be killing spectres in Oasis with my guild when a GM event type message went by. Sorry I don't have the exact text, but something like: The spectres sweep across the desert. Pain and Kill arrive on the scene, with Strike by their side. They will not rest until you are all dead.<br>
<br>
Ooooh icky we are all thinking, GM events *shiver*... but being as we are of good level to kill specs anyways, and with a 52 mage to back us up, Greatheart lvl 31 cleric, Worgan lvl 35ish shammy, and myself at 38, we all head for the docks, where people are shouting that Kill is killing people. We get there and start attempting to fight, and promtly lag out for (and I am not joking) **5 mins**. Gm's never learn not to hold events during high lag periods, our 52 mage had already died to a spec to the same kind of lag while watching over us. Anyways, I come back to a dead group and am shortly thereafter dead without a healer. I come back and loot my body (didn't lose xp) and go right back into the fray. Each time the spectres seemed to focus on me (perhaps I was the only real threat there, that seems kinda funny lol) and ganged up on me unless I ran, then they split up and kept killing. So we all gang up on Strike, and many people kept me healed till I finally bit the dust, and of course *then* Strike dies. The other 3 (Suffering was the 4th, and was not mentioned in the preliminary event text) were taken out one by one before I could get back (no xp loss again).<br>
<br>
Think: Pain and Suffering Strike at you ready to Kill, but miss. Seen that message? I could have it wrong (bad memory) but gosh it just seems too coincidental... from bleeding to death type messages.<br>
<br>
It turns out that no one except lvl 20-40 people were attacked or could hit the named spectres, who were obviously GM's. the loot was EE bags, an obsidion scemi, and rapiers. It was not long after this that Tunare was spotted at the wizzy spires in Gfay, and well then the whole freakin zone crashed after that. =P<br>
<br>
.....zzzz... *snort* oh umm.. The End<br>
<br>
*salute!* <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uajram.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ajram</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0> at: 6/3/01 8:29:17 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=505050><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucorpseus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Corpseus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/4/01 11:30:43 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Two reports for ya, one brand new - Valkirie</span><hr size=1> I was in Oasis at the time, I was just wandering through, on my way from south ro to EC when I saw the message, I immediately pulled up a pet and the 4 spectres all spawned with pets.<br>
<br>
I targetted Strike since he was the biggest one and conned it, it conned green and indifferent so I set my pet to attack it.<br>
<br>
&quot;That is not a legal target, master&quot; came the response.<br>
<br>
&quot;WTF?&quot; came my response.<br>
<br>
I tried to lifetap Strike and nothing happened, it was almost like when you try and cast on a PC and nothing happens.<br>
<br>
Then I sent my pet to attack Strikes pet, it killed Strikes pet in under 3 seconds and then, because of the Pet AI, my pet proceeded to immediately pummel the crap out of Strike. I got Strike down to 40 percent health before the rest of the spectres realised what was going on and began healing Strike and nuking my pet. My pet eventually died and instead of the spectres coming for me they proceeded to kill the newbies around the docks instead!...<br>
<br>
I thought *this is fucking stupid&quot; and remade my pet, I then went after Kill and using the same tactic of attacking his pet first, I got Kill to 20 percent HP before the other spectres came and started killing my pet again. I bet at first the GMs were thinking &quot;WTF? how am I being attacked?&quot; and I also noticed that they were moving extremely fastly and my pet wasn't doing full damage to them, so they were definately not NPCs.<br>
<br>
Eventually, since I wasn't getting anywhere, I left Oasis to go and summon a few friends corpses in Permafrost Keep when I received the hoax message that the war had begun in Gfay, I immediately got a port to Gfay, lagged out cos of the 250 people in the zone and then decided that since it was 1AM GMT that I'd log for the night.<br>
<br>
3 hours later Firiona Vie spawned and the Tunare/Cazic event took place, of course Verant ALWAYS schedule GM events when only US people can take advantage of them....when will Verant learn that Ayonae Ro mainly consists of European players?!<br>
<br>
Anyway, rant off hehe, hope you find this info helpful.<br>
