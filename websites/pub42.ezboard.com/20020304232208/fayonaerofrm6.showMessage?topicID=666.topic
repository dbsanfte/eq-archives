<br>
Horses! <br>
&gt; <br>
Just like the transportation we use in the real world, horses range widely in cost and speed, from a relatively affordable 8400pp Chevy to the 105,000pp Porche. They are summoned from a riding whip, and cannot exist at the same time as any pet or familiar. There are 4 color choices, brown, tan, white and black, 4 whip types, rope, leather, silk and chain, and sizes vary depending on your race. The summoning whips are no drop, so you'll have to buy your own pony, no Christmas gifts, but they are not lore, so if you're really rich you can buy a horse to match each outfit. You can cast on horseback, but not while riding, and no mean monsters are going to slay your horse unless they kill you first. The two of you are one! The animations are beautiful, and as a horse person in real life, I'm particularly impressed by the little touches. It takes a while for your horse to hit running speed, it will walk a few steps, trot a few steps, then speed up and race like the wind. The view is very realistic in first person view, so targetting might be a bit of an issue, and the different sizes mean the different racial heights are even more noticeable. The sound of hoofbeats as you race across the world will make you believe you can feel the wind in your hair. <br>
<br>
I'm going to have to start having foragers save me carrots. My pony deserves the very best! <br>
<br>
Available for sale at any reputable stable are sixteen types of bridle, these are split into four categories Rope, Leather, Silk and Chain (These correspond to the speed of the horses, with Rope being roughly equivalent to the speed of Journeyman's Boots and Chain being slightly slower than Spirit of The Cheetah.). The colour of each bridle corresponds to the colour of the horse Tan, Brown, White and Black. The prices can range from 10,000pp being the cheapest to 113,750pp for the most expensive (Depending on you faction with <br>
the merchants.). <br>
<br>
Now once you have purchased a bridle you will need to place it one of your main inventory slots and summon your magical steed by right clicking on the bridle. After a few seconds your mount will arrive and you will be placed upon his or her back. If you no longer require the services of your fine <br>
steed you only need click the icon in your buff window and you mount will disappear to be called again when you need him. <br>
<br>
Horses can only be summoned while outside. <br>
<br>
While riding a horse you can perform all the actions you could under normal circumstances e.g. Spell casting. <br>
<br>
Before you say what is the point of owning a horse when you can quest for Journeyman's Boots or buy a Spirit of the Wolf potion ? Well they are a status symbol for the rich and famous and look wonderful. <br>

Oh yeah, for info on Alternative Advancement go here - members.sniffout.com/cafe...Skills.htm<br>
<br>
It is for mages but give you an idea of what it will be like. You must first choose 6 general skills before you can learn an arch skill, and finally you must learn 6 arch skills before you can learn 1 class specific skills. General skills are increase stats/resistances/health regen, arch skills are ones dealing with improving spellcasting (ie, cast time, critical strikes, channeling) and mana regen, and finally class specific will be the druid specific ones.<br>

APPENDIX D - Alternate Advancement for Shadows of Luclin <br>
<br>
Alternate Advancement <br>
<br>
The alternative advancement system allows anyone who has purchased and installed EverQuest(r): Shadows of Luclin to further customize their high level (51+) characters. Customized features include things such as minor permanent statistic and resistance boosts, unique skills based on your class (warrior, magician, etc.) or archetype (fighter, magic user, and priest), and general skills available to everyone. These skills include anything from enhanced metabolism to improvements in skills already available to your class. You can also gain a title for your character based on the choices you make when enhancing your character. These titles will be visible to other players. <br>
<br>
Gaining these alternate skills and powers will require the expenditure of experience points. You will be able to funnel incoming experience either into your alternative advancement pool or into your standard experience pool. You can even choose to have a percentage of your incoming experience go into each pool. Once enough experience has entered the alternative advancement pool, you will receive skill points that may be used to acquiring your enhancements. When you acquire the proper amount of training points, you will have the option of choosing which enhancement you wish to gain. Some enhancements may have prerequisites. A prerequisite is a skill or skills that you will need to obtain before you can get the enhancement. <br>
<br>
Experience loss due to death suffered by the character will be taken from the &quot;Leveling&quot; experience pool, it will not impact your alternative advancement pool. <br>
<br>
You can access the Alternate Advancement menu by clicking on the ADV button in the inventory screen. <br>
<br>
Note: All characters will be able to open the interface screen for Alternate Advancement. But only those that actually purchase the Shadows of Luclin expansion will be able to earn any of these abilities. <br>
<br>
Also Note: EverQuest is an evolving game. We may add new abilities or change existing ones at a future date. We will, of course, attempt to keep changes to a minimum and will update this document to reflect such changes. <br>
<br>
Unlocking Archetypes and Class Abilities: <br>
<br>
There are three types of Alternate Abilities: General, Archetype and Class Abilities. Each is a stepping stone for the next. Attaining a certain number of General abilities is required before you can learn any abilities from your Archetype. Similarly, you will have to attain a prerequisite number of abilities from your Archetype to start gaining abilities from your Class group. There are also level requirements for each of these levels. Keep in mind that you can't gain any of these abilities unless you own Shadows of Luclin. <br>
<br>
These requirements are in addition to any prerequisites needed for some abilities. <br>
<br>
General abilities: A character must be level 51 or higher to open up the General abilities. <br>
Archetype abilities: A character must have spent six skill points on General abilities and be 55th level or higher to open up the Archetype abilities. <br>
Class abilities: A character must have spent twelve skill points on Archetype abilities and be 59th level or higher to open up the Class abilities. <br>
<br>
Skill Levels and skill points: <br>
<br>
Once you have gained enough experience points toward alternate advancement (enough to fill the experience bar) you will earn one skill point. It is these skill points that allow you to purchase alternate advancement abilities. Each ability will require a certain number of skill points to purchase one skill level with that ability. <br>
<br>
Every ability available through the Alternate Advancement system has a skill level associated with it. For many of these abilities there is only one skill level, meaning that once you purchase the ability you have attained all the skill available for that ability. But several abilities have more than one skill level. Gaining a second or third (or more) skill level in an ability will improve that ability. However, it is important to note that a second skill level is usually more costly than the first, and the third more costly than the second. That expense is rewarded, however. If additional skill levels cost more, the skill level also means a greater increase in the power of that ability. <br>
<br>
Let's look at two examples: <br>
<br>
Improved Natural Strength has five skill levels. However, each skill level for this ability costs one skill point. Each time you raise your skill level with this ability you gain two points of strength. <br>
<br>
Healing Adept (from the Priest Archetype) has three skill levels. Each skill level costs progressively more skill points. The first skill level costs two skill points for a 2% improvement in healing spells. The second skill level costs four points, but improves that percentage to 5%. The third skill level costs six skill points, but raises the percentage to 10%. <br>
<br>
Titles: <br>
<br>
Upon attaining enough skill ranks with the Abilities of each type (General, Archetype and Class), characters will be granted a title to show their efforts. The title for anyone meeting the requirements for General Abilities will be given the title Baron or Baroness. Other titles will be given as the character progresses through their alternate advancement, but we don't want to spoil the fun by giving them all away here. <br>
<br>
Ability Types: <br>
<br>
There are two types of abilities, passive and active. <br>
<br>
Passive abilities are always on and always have effect. Most abilities are passive. In fact, all General and all Archetype Abilities are passive. <br>
<br>
Active abilities need to be triggered by the player. Every active ability has a Refresh Timer associated with it. This indicates how long it will be after using the ability before it can be used again. Refresh Timers are given with two times, in game time and real life time. For every minute that passes in the real world, 20 minutes passes in the game world. <br>
<br>
<br>
General Abilities <br>
<br>
The General abilities are available to any character level 51 and above that has the Shadows of Luclin expansion. All General Abilities are Passive. <br>
<br>
