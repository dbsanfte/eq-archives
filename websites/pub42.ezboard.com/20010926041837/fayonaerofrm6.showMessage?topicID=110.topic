<br>
So, about americans getting upset when people speak german...<br>
In my eyes it's not so much that americans speak only english while germans speak both german and english.<br>
<br>
It's more that germans often know english and german, but not french and swedish, while swedes often know swedish and english, but not german and french, and so on.<br>
<br>
As always, it's a matter of balance.<br>
Demanding that english be spoken at all times is pure silliness. <br>
On the other hand, spamming people with text they can't understand or cutting them out of the talk by using a unknown language, that's really rude.<br>
<br>
I am from sweden, yet I am among those who have at times complained about people speaking french or german in situations or extents I found inappropriate. Most of those times someone replied to me that we americans should shut our mouths. Hey, I'm no fanatic about english, it's not even my language. It just happens to be a language that I can speak!<br>
<br>
So, where goes the line then?<br>
In my eyes, people raiding or visiting zones that are otherwise more or less empty should use whatever language that suits them. Ibn more packed zones, none-english should be limited to greetings and very short conversations. Those zones are spammed enough as it is, without the added preassure of text that is simply &quot;fhsdlfhs fsidfhsrif f sdifpsudf fsodpfjurswef&quot; to most readers. <br>
<br>
Also, if all six in a group understands one language but five are more comfortable with a language the sixth don't understand, then stick to the first language goddamnit.<br>
<br>
I have many times been in groups with five swedes and one german. We used english at all times since we all know that language while the germans (one german each time, but different germans in different groups) didn't know swedish and several swedes didn't know german. Of course we five could have talked swedish with each other instead, but cutting out the german guy from the grouptalk wouldn't be nice, would it?<br>
Yet that have happened to me so many times when grouped with germans or frenshmen that insisted that it's my own problem if I don't know their language.<br>

Grouptalk is a litte bit different. I know three people - two from my guild - that speak nerly no english. I often get /t or /gu like &quot;what does (english text) mean&quot; or &quot;how do i say (german text) in english&quot;.

I keep my mouth shut and after a few requests to keep the conversation to tells being ignored I switch to words that everyone can understand and make my exit from the group.  All players of all languages I believe know the word, Train!<br>
<br>
An argument can be made that the game is an American produced game and the default language should be English.  If I were playing a Japanese produced game I would expect the default language to be Japanese. A French produced game... defult language I would expect to be, of course, French.  To the person of which you speak that was saying that Americans should just keep their mouths shut I would have to respond by saying, &quot;Get the fuck off our internet before we decide to do some policing actions in your part of the world.  Now shut the fuck up before we cut your supply of Pepsi and Coke.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, being an American who speaks only a tiddle of French as a second language... I'm trying to improve a bit.  I will have to admit that some languages to me right now are an f'n mystery I'm not willing to touch just yet.  Those languages being Japanese, Swedish, and Dutch.  I am making some efforts to learn German and more French as I see myself having to dealing with more and more languages in the future.  I'm not going to stop playing online games and I'm going to have to deal with more and more folks of other nations with different languages.  Besides, it never hurts to improve yourself.  My only wish is that I had run into all these people years ago when I would have had the time and the real desire to learn those extra languages.<br>

If the Ogres all speak Ogre, the Gnome doesnt necessarily know what is going on, besides this being rude.  That is why the game has a COMMON language.<br>
<br>
In this instance we can think of English as being the 'common' language of the game.  I don't mind occassionally seeing /ooc, /shout, /auction in another language but when it continues over time, I will send one of the people a tell asking them to take it to tells.  It becomes annoying trying to see what is going on in zone and not being able to read half of it.  Or having it look like gibberish.  I too have many friends in many different countries.  I do not speak other languages, but since I have not had alot of interaction in the past with people who speak other languages, I will not apologize for it.  <br>
<br>
Lord knows America has enough differences in its own language as well as Canadians.  Going from one part of this country or into Canada can be very much like going from one country to another in Europe.  You learn the most common terms in the country (or part of the country) that you go into often.  If we are not going into France, Sweden, Germany, or any other part of Europe, why should we learn your language?  In this game we are not visiting your country, you are visiting ours.  It is polite to use the language of the country you are in.<br>
<br>
Where Latin used to be the world common language.  It seems that English has become the world common language.  If you are playing a world common game, it is just polite to use the common language.  In this instance it is English. If another language takes over as world common, then we should all learn it.  Until then it is rude to continue to speak in another language after being &quot;politely&quot; asked to take it somewhere else.  And I assure you I have always asked politely.<br>
<br>
I am ashamed at some of the things I have seen Americans say to Europeans in shouts and, in tells, take them to task even more than the Europeans.  I have found that the /ignore works just as good to stop having to read stuff that bothers me.  And I use it liberally.<br>

<br>
I have been in one such group. It was ok. They warned me about the language problem before I joined, and then we communicated as well as we could.<br>
<br>
But if I join a group and my five groupmates all keep to german (or frensh or japanese or whatever), then there are only two explenations. Either none of them have a common language with me, and in that case I should not be in the group and it was wrong of them to invite me without warning. Or they simply choose to treat me badly because I am not of teh same nationality as they are.<br>
<br>
Using ones language to push people down is a extremely bad and dishonorable practice. This goes both ways of course, and does most definitly include americans who ridicule others for not haveing english as their first language.<br>

if i would be in a group and even though *i* would understand what 4 others and me are saying, but the rest of the group would try to leave one person out because he doesn't understand german/french/swedish, i would kick their asses and insist that we speak english.<br>
<br>
because imo, english is the common language in EQ, there is nothing wrong about that - if you start to play you SEE that english is most used, so if you don't like it or don't speak english very well, just don't start to play. that might sound rude, but a friend of mine once had to deal with two groupmembers who did not even speak ONE single word english. not even ONE. i guess they knew what TRAIN meant, but i'm not sure about that.<br>
<br>
although i am not trying to harass someone here, i think those two players were dangerous for the whole group. you can imagine why, there was just NO communication between them and the other 4 groupmembers. this was, to my knowledge, not in a dungeon or something, but imagine you are invited into a group in sebilis and find out that the cleric only speaks and writes... &quot;a_ foreign_language_04&quot;. did this already happen to one of you? did it work out well? or not?<br>
<br>
personally i agree with what Edeina -i think- said, spamming (!) a crowded (!!!) zone with non-english messages is bad,  but flaming someone for saying something in another language is bad too. of course, there are always exceptions to the rule. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucasidy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Casidy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(3/8/01 5:28:15 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: About languages</span><hr size=1> Actually...

The only logical thing is that English should be spoken as soon as there are people from other countries present. <br>
<br>
I can get very cranky and deeply annoyed when people excessivly speak other languages over OOC or Shout, never really seen it in an auction.. <br>
<br>
I speak english somewhat good I've managed to live by it for a year of everquest now, I understand some german and some french. Which means that the times that germans of french people talk over ooc and shout I can understand bits and pieces, but like what? 50% of the other people in the zone does not, I think it is very ignorant to disrespect these people.<br>
<br>
I've gotten into groups on more then one occasion that only talked in theire native language which I could not understand.. my simple solution has always been to start talking a hell load of Swedish, finally this will annoy them since they can't understand a word of what I am saying, and perhaps then they will get my point. Most of the time it works.<br>
<br>
I know that alot of people does not get the same ammount of english in school as the Swedes does, we read ALOT of english. which makes it difficult for these people, but can't we all atleast try? <p>Flexure Graverobber, 52 cleric -

I have never run into any of the mentioned language problems. Everyone that I have encountered has been nice about this, even in cases where the rest of the group barely understood English or one member didn't speak it at all.<br>
<br>
<br>
In those cases, we generally stuck to a very simplified communication system using the common acronyms, such as:<br>
<br>
AFK - not ready for pull<br>
OOM - I'm out of mana, don't pull anything... later followed by a number when ready<br>
INC - I found something for us to kill<br>
<br>
<br>
It can sometimes make for a nice EXP crunch group as chit-chat is cut off completely.<br>
<br>
<br>
However, my character class has leaned me towards being the person who goes and finds the monsters for the group. As such, there is a strong need for the group to be able to communicate with me.<br>
<br>
<br>
If someone did give me a hard time about not speaking another language, I'd probably switch the ingame language from Common to any of the ones I am so bad at that it would be unlikely that anyone would understand it. <p><P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">

Apparently, you select the language in which you'll be speaking and the language in which you'd like to listen, and the program does the rest.<br>
<br>
I've managed to get a hold of the code, and here's an example of how it works.  <br>
<br>
A German_03 says &quot;Great job guys!  I thought we were dead when that fourth froggie joined the fight.  All you guys rock!&quot;<br>
<br>
A Frenchman_06 hears &quot;Happy doing peoples!  Me pretends it feels dead after pudding comes tagging along.  Every peoples are stoned!&quot;<br>
<br>
A Japanese_01 hears &quot;You do it!  It dies on jumping toads arguing four times against helping.  All your human are rocking to us!&quot;<br>
<br>
An American_2140 hears &quot;Great!  We're dead.  All you guys suck!&quot;<br>
<br>
A Swede_04 hears &quot;I'll buy hand job, guys!  Why the insistence on beating frogs while it must be out looking for delivery boys which vanished the day after next holiday during the last snowstorm.  It is working as intended!&quot;<br>
<br>
OK, so it needs some work, but at least they're trying.<br>

<br>
I have no problem with this.  In fact, I think it is great!  I am an American, and the only language that I can speak fluently is English.  I have a strong interest in German and can usually follow a conversation, even if I do speak it badly after 5 years of classes.  I don't mind not being able to understand what people are saying to each other (notice each other, not me =) because I think it adds flavor to the game.  On CT, I would rarely come across Europeans speaking a native language.  I see it all the time now, and it serves to remind me that no only are all these characters indeed real people, but they are from all over the world.<br>
<br>
However if someone is demanding you learn their language to group with them... well not only is that illogical, but it is rude.  If someone told me that, I would make damn sure I never grouped with, ported, or ressed their rude sorry ass  in the future.  The logical thing to do would be to use a language that everyone is comfortable with and can communicate in.  If everyone in your guild speaks German, use German in guildchat.  If everyone in the group speaks French, by all means use French in groupsay.  If you plan on auctioning things or asking questions of the zone in Swedish for example, don't expect a lot of replies... =)<br>
<br>
Another thing which is bothersome, though not a huge problem as far as I can tell, is people flinging insults in languages they know you cannot understand.  Come on people, how glorious is that?  If you think you have the balls to flame someone, at least make it understandable to them.  If you are calling them names in French and they speak only Spanish and English, then you may as well be talking to a brick wall.  Of course you still get the taunt factor out of it since it is rather obvious when someone is saying nasty things regardless of language...  but what's the point?  It's a cowardly practice plain and simple.  It's a way to say &quot;I showed him&quot; while essentially not doing a damn thing or putting yourself at risk for a rebuttal.  What does someone say to a nasty name that they can't understand? Nothing.  Does that mean you got the best of someone? No, it means you're a dork and can't say it to their face.<br>
<br>
