Also, this question will not apply to everyone, but I'd like to hear the opinions of some people on this server.<br><br>  I've been playing EQ for about 8 months and have had the most wonderful gaming experience I've ever had so far.  I am far from an expert on all MMORPG's, though I have been playing them since the early days of M59. My question is simply this: Why all the powergaming? <br><br>From my first experience on EQ 8 months ago, I was confronted with a wide-open fantasy world of wonder &amp; awesome beauty; with dreams of adventure &amp; glory. I was swayed away from my 2 year UO account by a friend who swore to me that EQ was more than just hack &amp; slash &amp; stats. What I have found is that he was right, but only if YOU the player keep that in mind and choose to play as such. Because, trust me...most people you meet are gonna shatter that illusion of fantasy tootsweet! <br><br>As an EQ newbie, I created my 1st (and still only) character; a halfling Cleric. My RL friend who got me into the game ported his lvl 60 druid to Rivervale to meet me. I was very excited about exploring the area &amp; getting a feel for the game, but my friend said immidiately &quot;Ok, come on...we gotta go power-level ya!&quot; <br><br>Well, ok, I thought. A couple quick early levels will only help me to be able to explore more on my own, etc. SO we went &amp; boosted me to around L5 or 6 when I told him I wanted to go explore more of the area around Misty &amp; fight some goblins &amp; such. His response was one of pure shock: &quot;But why? We gotta get you leveled &amp; get you some uber-armour so you can get out &amp; play the GAME!&quot; <br><br>This is the part that, no matter how open-minded I try to be, I just don't understand. Why can't EQ just be fun? Meaning, what the hell are you people out there power-leveling for? ESPECIALLY you fellow newbs? Isn't there a ton of things that you are missing out on never being able to fight? A ton of places that go unexplored? Why should you sit in one place for hours being PL'd &amp; killing the SAME reds over &amp; over when there is a dungeon nearby that is tailor-made for you to adventure in? What are you working towards? <br><br>I understand we'd all like to kill emporers &amp; gods one day, but it seems like to many people, the early &amp; mid game are just completely passed over in an attempt to LEVEL LEVEL LEVEL ASAP! If I had listened to my friend &amp; had him take me to Oasis at L8-9 or LOIO at 10-15 to be PL'd, I'd have never gotten to explore Befallen &amp; test my faith &amp; steel againt the unholy legions within; I'd have never gotten to know all the NPC's in my town or gotten to strike fear into the hearts of Runnyeye goblins. I would have missed all these wonderful adventures I've had just because I was worried that I wouldn't level fast enough. <br><br>There is so much content &amp; so much to see; what is the difference between fighting a Gorge Minotaur at lvl 12 &amp; fighting Giants at 45? It's the exact same situation, and boy would I have been dissappointed if the first time I came upon that Gorge Minotaur he was green because I had been killing Red Knolls in one spot for 600 hours while getting SOT'd &amp; SLN'd by the LVL 60 Druid behind me. That, to me, is not fun. Adventuring &amp; exploring &amp; playing the game are fun; and I'm so glad I didn't miss out on any of the low-end content. When I did slay my first dragon, it was so sweet in part because I had earned it; and further on down the road, while we're all sitting in the Plane of Justice medding up, I imagine I'll have quite a few more interesting stories to tell than some will. Unless you find stories of mathematic equations &amp; dmg/dly comparisons etc. interesting...I personally don't.<br><br>Just my two cents worth, but I really am curious to hear from people who play from this perspective. Enlighten me, and maybe I won't be so annoyed when I meet you in the game. <br><br>-Twosheds Tuggins <br>-L48 Cleric of The Order of Bristlebane <br>-Rivervale, Antonica<br><br>P.S. I do realize that many people play alternates and, having done it all before, they feel no need to do it all again &amp; just want to get their character to a LVL that is useful to them. This is a different situation than I am talking about, so please don't respond with that explanation if you don't mind ) Thanks.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucaeanthepaladin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CaeanthePaladin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/29/02 7:43:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2933.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://caean.20fr.com/Caean2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why the powergaming mindset?</span><hr size=1> some people have friends who are high level. They want to play with them and experience the game with them.<br><br>Other people are leveling because their guild needs a particular class, such as a cleric, or a warrior.<br><br>Other people just have no appreciation for the process and want to get to the &quot;end&quot; of the game, without realizing that no such thing exists.<br><br>The bottom line is they at least think they're having fun, or think that if they do this, they will have fun at a later time.<br><br>The truth is, if you don't enjoy the lower levels, you'll probably never enjoy the higher levels. That's why you see a ton of people 2 and 3-boxing. They can kill, get exp quickly in their non raiding times, then go raid and enjoy that.<br><br>2-boxing is entirely another issue, which in my opinion has killed the pickup group completely. Between guild groups and 2-boxing not much is left for the casual player who just wants some exp.  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=36323 ">Caean Sacroguerre, Knight of Tunare</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=friday>Friday</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local Resident</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/29/02 8:02:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2933.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Heh</span><hr size=1> Everquest is what you make it.<br><br>I have been playing since beta, and while i had no one to power level me (because few people were more then 4 levels above me) i still pushed foward each day to become more powerful.<br><br>Why is that?

Now, I went on some raids after level 46, such as Hate and HS, but most of the exp was earned solo, as it was quicker that way, with just the druid along for DS and Skin buffs and regen.  This was done because the guild needed this &quot;tool&quot;, but I am now actually having more fun playing this PL'ed char, because of the places a Rogue is needed that a Druid is really not - Dungeon crawling!<br><br>I have had great fun raising both chars to their current levels, by both methods.

I started playing in Jan 2001, and even then there were a lot of folks who were heavily twinked out and/or mainly interested in powerlevelling up to where the 'real' game was with the folks post level 50.  Some of the first people I hooked up with in that game had that mindset, and I found it very irritating when they would try to give me stuff or drag me someplace where we would stand in one place and kill mobs while some L 50 druid or enchanter would babysit us.  Talk about boring!  So Faervas and I resolved that we weren't going to let the game be 'ruined' for us, and made an effort to find other people who were also new to the game to play with, or who were at least willing to explore, and make messy mistakes in, exotic places.  A year and a half later, we have friends in our little resultant guild with mains from level 13-55; and while we have crawled at least part of all of the old world dungeons, most of the newer ones in our level range, and are about to take our first all guild group to Sebilis, we have mains who are just now doing Unrest and Najena, so we try very hard to let those who are just starting to learn the game, or are very casual players, enjoy the game at their own pace.  <br><br>I personally don't get, either, people who 'rush' the levelling/item acquisition process; in my mind, they are only cheating themselves out of a big part of the joy of the game.  It *does* suck some when you are in small guild and you can't offer your friends much other than a good time because the item economy in the game is so screwed up.  In that regard the Luclin Twilight quests have been a godsend, as they are something that most of our folks can help with, and that we get a sense of accomplishment (and some spiffy, unique stuff!) out of doing.   But some folks are always going to have the linear, 'beat the game' kind of mindset, even in a very open-ended game like EQ, and well, all I can say is 'different strokes for different folks...<br><br>Regards,<br>Nydia Ywalmoriel<br>Autonomous Collective<br><br>P.S.  Some of the best times I have ever had in the game have been in Runnyeye, especially just post-revamp. <br>One night, even with Endure Magic on him, our (halfling druid) puller was coming back charmed about every other pull, and we would watch him run to the corner, turn towards us, and his little hands light up, as he proceeded to nuke the crap out of us <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/urolielkotn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RolielKotN</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/30/02 2:38:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2933.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why the powergaming mindset?</span><hr size=1> EQ is pretty hack and slash, but the hack and slash is pretty in-depth. <p><IMG SRC=http://www.tiannathomas.com/images/roliel3.gif><small><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uapocc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Apocc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Journeyman</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/30/02 2:11:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2933.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why the powergaming mindset?</span><hr size=1> Well as for me, since working with my main after a very long time trying to figure what class and race I want to play.

Its a very subtle thing, but when you group with these ppl in the high level you CAN tell. From the way they disreguard position of their during combat, to not jelling correctly with the differing classes during the combat. etc.<br>Yes sometimes its just very very poor players who did level up the good old way, but most of the time it is only a player that never learned all the critical aspects of the game that you can only learn from 1-50.<br>/shrug<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=2933.topic&start=21&stop=30>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=2933.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=2933.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2933.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=2933.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.threadControl?topicID=2933.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2933.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2933.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm14">Guilds<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm13">NWN & Morrowind<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Trash Bin<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Staff Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1>General Forum</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
