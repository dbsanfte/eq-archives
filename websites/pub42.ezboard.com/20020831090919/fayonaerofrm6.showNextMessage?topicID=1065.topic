They relate to a state of mind that consumes many Everquest players. <br><br>When did you first become set on the mind of projecting yourself as a professional player? A boastful &quot;my guild did it with six compared to yours doing it with 12, heh&quot; player. At what level do you abandon integrity for materialistic prestige? At what point in your game life did you abandon being helpful, being sensitive to other players around you? At what point did you become the player who only showed courtesy to those who shared your guild tag, and decided those not in your club aren't worth as much? At what level do you start calling players with less experience than you &quot;newbies&quot; and feel proud that you are not one?<br><br>Do you like to say you play for friends? Do your actions show it, or is it a fun thing to say?<br><br>Do you watch &quot;The Chair&quot; ?<br><br>How long do reputations last? <br><br>What zone were you in when you first said &quot;Naggy&quot;? How often to you type &quot;stats&quot; in one day? Do you ever find yourself using teen chat speak? Have you ever realized your manner of speech is copied from or bares it's origins in teen chat speak? &quot;me am tired, but luv u tho&quot;. Ever find yourself adopting the communication abilities of one who is poor at english...while it is your native tongue? Do you loot corpses quickly? Are you the first person to say &quot;numbers plz' in group? Are you the first person to ask &quot;stats?&quot; in group? <br><br>Does Jermain O'Neal average more rebounds per game than Rasheed Wallace?<br><br> Do you like to have temper tantrums in real life? Ever find the advantage of venting off your vulgarity onto an internet message board? <br><br>What level were you when you decided those players who didn't play at your level were less than you? Is that a defense mechanism, do you think? If a player doesn't view the game as you do...and don't give you &quot;props&quot; are they envious of you? <br><br>Do you ever feel the need to assert yourself as an old player? Ever read a &quot;remember when...&quot; post and feel it was your need to chime in as one of the shrine members of Everquest? <br><br>Is Rand going to die?<br><br>Are you a shaman? Or a shammy? Why?<br><br>How do you handle your materialistic desires in game? Do you think it reflects on your materialistic desires out of game? Would these questions help you to determine if you were materialistic? Or would you never be able to realize that? Is it bad to be materialistic?<br><br>Is it better to know everything about the game, or be fresh and new to it? Why do we react as we do to those who are fresh and new to it? Social class? Virtual world...<br><br>Does your husband/boyfriend know you're saying that to him? Would you feel guilty if your husband read over your shoulder late at night?<br><br>How do you define winning? If you are in the strongest guild, with all the best loot, have you won?<br><br>Is your night a loss, if you didn't win any rolls? <br><br>What would your family think if you read your history of posts to them? Would you feel embarrassed? &quot;that's...not really how I am..&quot; <br><br>Do you have a piece of equipment on your character that was obtained dishonestly? Obtained in any way that would make another player frown? Do you feel you've ever cut someone out of something unfairly, but justify it as &quot;all in the theme of competition&quot;? Do you not feel as bad, if the player you cut off wasn't a member of your club? <br><br>Is everyone in your guild capable of representing the mentality you wish to present to the community? How did the Skexies determine leadership after the old one died in his bed, crumbling to dust? What happened to it's opposite among the light half making their way to the meeting place?<br><br>What makes you a good player, in your mind? Are you good because of you? Or because of who you're with? Is it You? Or your gulid?<br><br><br>Is it just a game? Or is there more to it? Has a friend ever hurt your feelings playing Super Dodge Ball? What about Everquest? What was the name of the song Janet Jackson's last  video was based on?<br><br>It's a very weird thing to me ! I don't think that those afflicted by negative personality complexes that arise inside of them as they play the game and interact with others...will even notice. Hell, maybe I havn't noticed my own greed in the game, regardless of thinking I've avoided it.  Nor will this post help a player come to a sudden realization as though saying &quot;oh ! Argh ! That's me !....I must improve !&quot;. It will no doubt bring out some of my rats to nibble. But some of these questions, I ask myself. To make sure I don't ever adopt certain qualities that might make a real person frown, who's never played. That might make me frown, if I caught myself behaving in such a manner. <br><br>Players change. At what level do the most dramatic changes occur? Ever become annoyed at the way high level players acted? Have you become one?<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/utreistaania.showPublicProfile?language=EN>treistaania</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(3/2/02 12:30:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1009.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: At what point in your Everquest career do you become....</span><hr size=1> at level 12...  <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=29989">My inventory<IMG SRC="http://user.tninet.se/~mhf993y/anna/wanwan2.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uedeina.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Edeina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Board Mistress</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(3/2/02 1:26:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1009.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.one.se/users/chribesk/edeina.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: At what point in your Everquest career do you become....</span><hr size=1> You forgot one important question:<br><br>&quot;Have you stopped beating your wife and molesting your daughter?&quot;<br><br>One a more serious note, some of your questions are very interesting. It's sad that you tilt the context so it looks more like you try to insult every member of the EverQuest Community with sarcastic rethoric questions rather then trying to achieve some deeper level of understanding.<br><br>Still, there is hope that we might build some constructive discussion. Lets see now...<br><br>First of all, what is a professional player?<br>To me, it's someone who spend a lot of time on the game and do more advanced stuff then leveling and camping stuff. The leaders, officers and key people of all active guilds are professional players, even if the guild isn't high end. Almost all players in High End raid oriented guilds (not only the most &quot;uber&quot; guilds) are professional players.<br><br>Being boastful and crude have nothing to to with being professional. There's a difference between a professional football player and a football hooligan, you know. (football, soccer, whatever. Don't get started.)<br><br>&quot;What level were you when you decided those players who didn't play at your level were less than you? &quot;<br><br>You really should have added a &quot;if&quot; to that question. If you really believe everyone is like that, then do yourself a favor: leave the game and everything related to it, and never look back. My experience is that such mentalities are very rare, but the few who have a &quot;holier rhen thou&quot; mentality (based on phat lewt or intellectual whining on boards or whatever) are quite loud and easy to remember. Thus they look much more common then they really are.<br><br>&quot;How do you define winning? If you are in the strongest guild, with all the best loot, have you won?&quot;<br><br>Whoever have the most toys when he dies wins, huh? Nah, really, there is no such thing as winning real life - or EverQuest. You can make victories in your real or online life, but you can never win the life itself. What matters in the end is not the end itself, but the path you took towards it. <br><br>Did you have fun? <br>Did you accomplish anything? <br>Did you leave any kind of legacy? <br>Do the people you left behind miss you, or are they glad you are gone? <br>Do you still have friends you met through the game?<br><br>&quot;Ever become annoyed at the way high level players acted? Have you become one?&quot;<br><br>I remember a few highlevel assholes from my lower level days, but also a whole lot of nice people. Again, if you think all high level players are assholes, why are you still here? <p>Love, Edeina<br>Highelf Arch Mage of Erollisi.<br>Citizen of <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero">Ayonae Ro</a>, member of <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/beternalwrath">Eternal Wrath</a>.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uhalochanter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HaloChanter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Maztah Pozter</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(3/2/02 2:44:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1009.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: At what point in your Everquest career do you become....</span><hr size=1> 'It's sad that you tilt the context so it looks more like you try to insult every member of the EverQuest Community with sarcastic rethoric questions rather then trying to achieve some deeper level of understanding.'<br><br>- THAT is the best definition of Dreadnok I've ever heard. <br><br>'Ever find the advantage of venting off your vulgarity onto an internet message board?

It was fueled by my disappointment in seeing a few players change in certain respects...leaning more toward the &quot;only the uber can win&quot; mentality, and looking down upon those who do not click and loot in Temple of Veeshan style areas. <br><br>If you feel threatened by a label I present, you're going to defend, and try to assert yourself. That's message board style.  I mean seriously....read an Edeina or Haloface post sometime. If you want to play with one of those two...by all means.  Not only have I read their personalities, I grouped with them while they leveled up be it as Dreadnok or another. They're not the type of company I prefer. I'll leave it up to your own intuitive post tone comprehension to discern why. If you are sympathetic to my opposition's perspective...we no doubt havn't and won't play together <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <br><br>The whole misinterpretation risk of posting a message on this board is the most irritating aspect. You have to click 'add post', and hope someone with a semblence of integrity reads, and hope the rats stay away (though you know the rats are there everyday). Then, when the rats begin to bite you have to hope their misinterpretation of your message and need for attention doesn't twist the message in the eyes of other readers. <br><br>Then, here's the most absurd part. The rats, post their nonsense in tones as if expecting you to talk to them. <br><br>One thing I will add, though so many have played with me that the goobers here don't mean so much...it's the image of me they portray that is incorrect, though it spawns in their bitterness knowing I don't approve of them as people. Screw how good you are at clicking and targeting, or how many other people with free time you managed to hang around with and tolerate. <br><br>I am a high level player, a few times over. My emphasis on this game is your personality, your integrity, your imagination, as well as your having the social mind set to avoid unhealthy addictive qualities of materialism in this game. <br><br>Absorbed? Excellent. Sure, the typical retort would focus on my arrogance, which screams at you through the way I write. How dare I. <br><br>I've played in every zone, killing all your favorite npc's with the exception of those in Sleeper's Tomb, North Temple of Veeshan, Last Sky Islands, and the high level Luclin boss encounters.  Reason? They mean so little to me, compared to my enjoyment of finding the best people...that you wouldn't even begin to understand . <br><br><br>(enter some &quot;me&quot; themes, boring stuff)Every night that I play, I encounter (and search for) the best players in this game. Every night that I play, I do play with just that. The best in this game. The main thing to look for in how good they are, is their personality quality.  See, you can learn to click and target in Everquest with little problem. Repetition alone will set in with the time you invest into your character and by level 53 you should be somewhat competent even with little post 8th grade education. However, you cannot learn social class through repetition. You have to have certain values. That's what matters. My target mentalities that I choose to &quot;mock&quot; in this game are going to make a lot of Everquest players feel threatened, and that's very much good to me. <br><br>So, step up, offer your chosen style of projection on the board, and rest assured I knew you wern't worth your salt before you started typing. I am familiar with who has honor on this board, who screams for attention on this board, who lacks class on this board...and so on. Don't think I don't know who's reading these messages. This is the NAG forum, most of the players I look for have no business offering their mind juice here, because they become too annoyed reading the content. <br><br>I absolutely require your responses, to show not only me, but lurkers who quietly read these boards, just what kind of player you are. Those who have played with me and know me, can't really complain about me in the sense a few of you try to paint me as deserving a complaint. <br><br>It bugs, that I have to even clear this up, but the most threatened by my posts tend to use particular tactics in order to rally support...and I must offer up a fact in order to water down that strategy. (yes, posters use strategies, because they are dying for you to agree with them when they offer up some obnoxiousness. My strategy is that I'm fishing for something. That's the honest truth. And I always get it, more truth juice. I get responses from players who I think would be great to group with, and players I show as ...being not ...so much)<br><br>My posts, if you have read them, do not include all high level players. There is, however, a very large group of players existing in the game that I avoid, and that I mock, and that do fall into the category of my stereo-type. I enjoy reading their posts as much as a great player who chuckles at a joke that I make here. <br><br>Some of you miss my sarcasm, make no mistake...many of my posts are written in humor. A comment I made even teased married women, flirting with boys while their husband was asleep. The &quot;hon plz thx me am good&quot; players, sure I tease you. The &quot;look at my stats, heh. this is uber shit&quot; players, you're damned right, I tease you. The players with a lack of emotional control posting here, <br><br>Think what you will ! Get what you get from it, but don't allow a misinterpretation of my post by a rat to steer you in the wrong direction. This message board has frequent posters who post in quanity, lacking quality. Many lurkers, and the occasional great player who doesn't partake in the mud rolling, choosing instead to offer insight.I'm annoyed with the many knuckleheads (by my own arrogant, social standards) on occasion, and I'll toss in my perspective, which should and will be unique. <br><br>There, I've tooted my own horn far too much already ! The length of this should discourage most to even read the last few paragraphs. I type quickly as well, so no typical &quot;jeezus, get life u need cuz u spend so much time think at us&quot; posts. <br><br>Blizz and Sandin, Narie,  thank you for your comments.  A few of you who know me, have a laugh or two. Narie, I'm not too cool for you at all, (I need cool lessons) dark elfen enchantressss. Perhapss if you wish we share more company in the near future. I've already read a few insightful posts by Sandin showing what I like to read.<br><br>As for the rest...have some cheese, rrrrrrats !
