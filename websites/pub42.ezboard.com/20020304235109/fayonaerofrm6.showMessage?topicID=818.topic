DoM is a small, mid to high level guild.<br><br>No offense to DoM, you just have quite a ways to go, and I can understand why this guild follows this policy.<br><br>But, maybe one day (Although, considering the reputation you are building for yourself now, that doesn't seem likely to happen) you'll join a large, well-respected high-level guild. And, then you will see, why open roll NBG is the poorest system of loot a guild could use. But, since you won't be dealing with things like plate BPs in HoT anytime in the future. apparently not even Thurg BPs, and things like how outfitting your MT is essential, you won't understand. Additionally, with a name like 'Biggi Shortpimp' I don't expect high levels of thinking from you.<br><br>However, you contradicted yourself when attempting to pose a counter-argument to my argument of who would get an RBG.In your argument, everyone who would use an item deserves to roll, as they all helped kill the same target. However, you claim WarriorB in my argument would not be allowed to roll, even though the RBG is better than his current haste item, and by your rules, should roll. So, you really don't agree with 'open roll', eh?<br><br>Also, FV is a strict role-playing server, but regardless, there are no 'pimps' in EverQuest, not even you. So, I don't expect your last name to last much longer. I suggest you read the Naming Policy, and realize that it does  indeed apply to all servers, and the world doesn't revolve around you. <br><br>____________________<br><br>Logix, i stated i was a high level warrior from a respected guild, which i am.<br><br>I also stated I didn't display my name earlier because a) most of my guildies give a rats ass about what i am arguing over and b) it's really not important who my guild is, just as the name of the warrior isn't important.<br><br>But define &quot;good&quot; guild please ) i'm interested in your definition.<br><br>We have over 40 main characters 50+. I don't consider that midlevel.<br><br>We are very capable of doing kael arena. The only thing holding us back at the moment is it's camped to hell most of the time when we'd be able to raid there.<br><br>Although you might find it hard to believe, we also have done ToV, and DN. Don't you think smaller guilds know the value of multiguild raids?<br><br>You can look down your nose at my guild and say <br><br>&quot;things like how outfitting your MT is essential, you won't understand.&quot;<br><br>if you wish.<br><br>Maybe it impresses you to see those words you typed, maybe even you say them as you type and like how they sound.<br><br>I'm not impressed in the least. <br><br>No, I don't stoop to the level of others who resort to flaming.<br><br>After all, if you want to make a conceited statement inferring that guilds who can't clear HoT or kill the larger targets are inherently dumber, that's your hole to dig for yourself. <br><br>Nitpicking about perceived uberness is..well..you'll figure it out. After all, I shouldn't have to explain things like that to you, I'm a dumb one from one of them lesser guilds.<br><br>Now that we got the guild nonsense out of the way:<br><br>&quot;Additionally, with a name like 'Biggi Shortpimp' I don't expect high levels of thinking from you.&quot;<br><br>What about shamanpimp?

She was just giving her views on what a &quot;mid level&quot; and &quot;high level&quot; guild are IN HER OPINION.  There's no reason to take it pesonal Biggi.<br><br>DoM has been a mid level guild for quite some time because of it's character levels and such, places it hunted, etc.  But over the last couple months DoM has started to distinguish itself as a guild and you are now going through the growing pains of becoming a high level guild.  It will take some time for everyone to see the changes and come to understand that you are actually growing into something better.<br><br>I stayed with DoM for about 6 months and met some of the nicest people I've ever known in the guild.  Finvarra, Sahandra, Cyane, Biggi, Dalsh, Jolonar, Alazen and Radlarri are just the tip of the iceburg and even though there have been changes of people, and the roles that some people play in the guild it is still a guild that I would be proud to ally myself with.<br><br>You know me pretty well Biggi, and you know I left to create my own guild &quot;Council of Lore&quot; and while some people might take it in a bad way to be called a newbie guild I am not.  With the proper path and a goal one day we may become a mid level guild, then a high level and maybe, just maybe, some day become an elite guild.

You've stated DOM is a bad guild (or at least not a good guild).<br><br>Why do you require a plethora of 50+ loyal members to constitute a &quot;good&quot; guild?  Clan Axepeak on Cazic-Thule is certainly what I would consider a good guild but they didn't have a large number of 50+ loyal members.  In my opinion having a plethora of 50+ members is in no way a requirement of a &quot;good&quot; guild.<br><br>Moreover, what in the heck does time of existence have to do with being good?

I've talked with her a few times in EC but that was a very long time ago and I doubt she even remembers it.  It was when I was still in IO, I asked her if she'd make me some easy jewelry for a friend if I brought her the supplies.  She agreed.  *shrug*  My experience with Logix is that she is an extremely intelligent person with a firm standpoint on many issues.  She always makes strong and logical arguements (No pun intended, honestly) and I've never seen her get bitchy or attack other people unless provoked beyond the bounds of what most would agree is appropriate.  In my dealings with her she has been curteous, polite and just plain old nice.  So why I see yet another thread in NAG with her name in it is beyond me.<br><br>At any rate, I had to ask who the hell DOM are so I could even respond to this.  I can't speak for Logix, of course, but it is my firm yet humble opinion that &quot;Crist0&quot; should shut his fucking mouth.<br><br>I'm sure it's all well and good to assume that 40 level 50+'s is good but I doubt there's usually that many on at a time.  And having a roster that boasts that many people is nice, but even when I was in Taltos/Magmor we had a roster of 60 people and we couldnt really consider ourselves &quot;big&quot;, at least not in my book.  Of course this leaves the subject of a large and small guild up for debate, but these are just my humble thoughts.<br><br>IMHO if you're hunting in Kael to get Thurgashit, you honestly cant be that good of a guild.  I mean, yes it's all well and good that you *can* get some of that upper level stuff, but most of the guilds that would be considered &quot;Good&quot; hunt in ToV.  I think I'm just opening myself up to be doused in a flammable fluid and set afire, but here's what I think.<br><br>If you're not in ToV, you cant really be considered a &quot;Good&quot; guild on the server.  Equipment-wise, at least.  If you dont possess the skill to join the plethora of guilds that regularly habit ToV then you are substandard.  You may possess the most inimate knowledge of tactics that could win you any fight in a pinch if you were in Veeshan's Peak.  BUt first you should step up to ToV, imho.<br><br>It's extremely noble to think that your people can make the guild good, but if you're just a bunch of newbies running around in banded and leather, even if you're the kindest souls in the world, you will most likely not find yourself branded as a &quot;Good&quot; guild.  A nice one, perhaps, but even I must say that you need to be more capable of large targets and have some possessions worth claiming to be considered good.<br><br>Flame away, 3 hours from now I'll be back from play practice.  I know I muist have left a few holes in that statement of mine.
