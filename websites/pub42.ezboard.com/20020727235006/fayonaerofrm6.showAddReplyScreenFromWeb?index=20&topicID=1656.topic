<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Umm its not the Russians im scared of ,its the middle eastern countries that are getting these nukes that Im afraid of.Those crazy bastards think that dying while killing innocent people is honorable and their duty to god.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Guess where they get their nuclear weapons? Russia. The people guarding them, are soldiers that havent been paid, and who's families are dying. Its only a matter of time before someone walks over with the right connections, hands them a suitcase full of money, and walks off with some new toys. Unsafely guarded weapons in Russia are part of the problem.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Nuclear weapons are never going to go away until we have mechanisms that make their deployment too expensive for the intended goal.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Theres a small problem with preventing nuclear war. The ABM treaty pretty much fucks any chance of us making a star wars system. Bush keeps pushing for it, and Putin is really pissed about it, because they signed a treaty in 2000 that said we *wouldnt* make ABM's in the style we're doing now. I realize Malse, that this isnt your point, but just to clear that up first.<br>
<br>
Now, your next statement is a damned good argument, and I like that, and Im going to use that in my debate rounds. I do, however, think that this mentality, that &quot;we keep what works till we get something cheaper and better&quot; is a part of the problem. We will keep nuclear weapons until everyone realizes how stupid they are. Think about this: We have a freakin lot of nuclear weapons, right? Why? Why in the hell does the world need enough firepower to destroy the world (I think it was 20-30 times over, i forget the exact figure)? A ridiculous arms race landed us with an even more ludicrous number of weapons. We cant even launch one of the friggin missles, because if we do, someone else launches one...then someone else...then someone else....so why the hell do we have them? <br>
<br>
Deterrence? Well.... I'll get to deterrence in a moment. But, to answer your argument Malse, nuclear weapons are already outdated. When we have a conflict, we always..always resort to conventional weapons, espically after the destruction we caused in Hiroshima. To me, a man with a gun in a paper bag is more effective and a nuclear weapon. At least he can choose his targets.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> More coutries a either developing nuclear weapons or trying to obtain them from other countries every day. Some of them that are, scare the crap outta me.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Did you know that currently, Russia delivers missile materials to Iran?<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.heritage.org/library/categories/forpol/em503.html">www.heritage.org/library/...em503.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
The fact that there are nuclear weapons around to be obtained..that bothers me. Youre all right, that the middle east is more frightening. But, think of it in terms of this - if a religious freakshow bent on cleansing the world got a hold of a nuclear weapon...we have no defense aganist it. NORAD is the best we can get, and thats a couple of Joe's in F-18's flying around hoping to shoot the damned thing with a missile. That would still detonate it, Joe wouldnt come home, he'd be a part of the aircraft he left in...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 200,000 nukes? <br>
<br>
Where the hell you getting your numbers son?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Please, you arent my father. Secondly, I spent the past 2 hours searching my stack of papers, and discovered my problem. I wrote this at 2-3am, god knows what was going through my head. Youre right, that number didnt sound correct: I added in an extra zero, because the world's number of nuclear weapons is approximately 20,000. Here's a link of something I found on the fly. Yeah, you're right, I was wrong, it was early. Nuke me.<br>

<br>
Now, lets talk deterrence.<br>
<br>
Deterrence is the reason we have so damned many nuclear weapons to begin with. Not only that, but it masks the true ramifications of nuclear war. We've entered a &quot;I have more nuclear weapons than you do, so dont mess with me&quot; mentailty, and that mindset leaves us thinking &quot;My dad can beat up your dad&quot; without realizing that a swing from any country would devestate the earth. Instead, we're left with &quot;lets keep em, cause we need them to prevent other people from blowing us up! we need all 10500 nuclear weapons sitting in holes in the ground!&quot; Friggin why? 1 is enough to scare the shit out of every american, it all depends on who has it. Terrorists arent detered by nuclear weapons. If someone in the middle east gets one, we'll go fucking nuts, because we dont have a system to stop them, we dont have a way to deter them, they think they're fighting for god, they'll use it if they want to. So why not get rid of the nuclear weapons, and prevent them from getting the technology? Better yet, lets un-do our ABM treaty and star wars the hell out of America. Shit, sell the technology to anyone that wants it. We arent going to use nuclear weapons in the first place. If everyone can prevent against using it, then whats the point of having them? If we disarmed 10499 of our supossed 10500 nuclear weapons, and kept 1, we'd still deter other nations. If we disarmed that last one, and kept our army, and all of our conventional weapons, we would CONTINUE to deter those nations, because one launch of another's nuclear stockpile would result in a mass-scale attack from all of our allies and what conventional weapons we had kept. No one is going to cause armageddon, no self-respecting nation, that is. The only threat we seem to have is terrorism, and nuclear weapons do nothing to stop them. By keeping them around, we instead are giving them a backdoor to crawl into and take what they want. Even if disarm has severe flaws, its better than keeping the damned things.<br>
<br>
For more on how deterrence is flawed, both theoretical and physically, go here. It makes for a great read, and it explains why I dont believe in deterrence.<br>

<br>
Now, about the IMF and inspections. Youre right, thats hard to pull off. Then again, the IMF has a little more power than the UN. What if the IMF strong-armed your nation, and fucked it's economy because they didnt cooperate? Nations will do as theyre told if they flounder and suffer from utter lack of trade with other countries.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Unless you define &quot;hair trigger&quot; as &quot;we have a process in place that enables us to launch our weapons in approximately 20 to 30 minutes.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Infact, that is exactly how I define hairtrigger.<br>
<br>
If you search on the web, look up anything, that is the technical definition of our current launch status and of Russia's. Hair trigger is approximately half an hour.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I doubt you even know what the current DEFCON level is.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Im not sure if they post it anywhere, but my guess is 4 or 5. What does this argument have to do with my above statements? Are you trying to insult me and prove your advanced military knowledge? What if we were at Defcon 1, does it really matter? <p><a href = "http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=62888" target = "_blank">Drakz Soulsnacks</a><br>
