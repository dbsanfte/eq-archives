this guy, like him or not...IS a baseball player..he IS what nearly every other pitcher in BASEBALL strives to be...your quick little Jim Rome...actually...SUCKED<br>
<br>
sorry bud ..but you are talking out your ass...you have ZERO knowledge of baseball......you prove this by spouting off with ignorant remarks about a current &quot;legend&quot; in baseball...and his legend status is not my opinion...ask any fan of the game..like him or not..he &quot;GET'S&quot; RESPECT...after all he has earned it...and earned it ALL...and you would suggest everyone believe he &quot;threw&quot; games to get traded......<br>

<br>
Starting a timeline from when Randy Johnson really became a star, 1995..His ERA never topped 3.7.  If you dont count an injury prone 1996, he wasnt above 2.5.  From 95-97 his record was 43-6.  And the Mariners were NOT a loser team. 95 was the big pennant race year, and they did well in 96 and 97 with Griffey, ARod, and several other stars.<br>
<br>
In 98, Johnson was 9-10 in 23 starts with the Mariners with an ERA of 4.33 (nearly double what it was the year before).<br>
<br>
That in itself is not anything to get in an uproar about, until you add some context..<br>
<br>
3 of the 9 wins he accrued with the Mariners were during  games when there were trade rumors over him going to Philidelphia (I think it was).  The 3 games he pitched before and the 4 after those three all ended in losses or no decisions for him.<br>
<br>
Once he was traded to Houstan in 98, his record for them went to 10-1 in 11 games started, with a 1.28 ERA, including a 0.42 ERA in home games..<br>
<br>
The bottom line though is that the numbers dont show the real picture.  I followed the team that season as was there to see his whining about wanting to be traded, and the obviously abismal pitching that had no basis on his skill.<br>
<br>
Since 98 his ERA hasnt been higher than 2.64. <p><HR WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="LEFT"><IMG SRC="http://outside.clanpages.com/podside.jpg" ALIGN="left" HEIGHT=100 WIDTH=100><br><b>Ullric Littleblade</b><br>Assassin of Tides of Valor<br><i><A HREF=http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=83046">"Speed kills if y'know what I mean."</A></i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uthuramrb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ThuramRB</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Regular Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(9/30/01 1:30:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=334.topic&index=186>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> Feta &gt; Mozarella <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/upalimaxsceleris.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Palimax Sceleris</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elite Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(9/30/01 6:33:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=334.topic&index=187>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> First, Feta &gt; Mozarella == True<br>
<br>
Second, if you ever, ever, did anything other than look up a bunch of stats, and actually went to the ballpark and watched Randy pitch, you'd see, that he is, without a doubt, a competetor.  Randy comes to play -- every game he brings the best game he possibly can.  I honestly believe his ERA and slumps up north were a direct result, not of his desire to tank a game, but of his bad back.  If he was tanking games he would have been benched.  This ain't the minor leagues; and he's a professional.<br>
<br>
Few people have ever played the game with the raw teeth-gnashing ferocity as Randy Johnson does every single time he steps on the mound.<br>
<br>
I feel sorry for whomever gets to bat in a 5 game series and face Randy and Curt TWICE.

He plays well now, but perhaps because he is playign for a team he wants to be with, and wants to win.  Several players joined the Mariners when they were little or nothing, got big with the Mariners, then left, whether in good or bad standing.

<br>
The M's front office did make a lot of mistakes, including trading away many great players (only 2 or 3 of the 95 starting team are still with the M's).<br>
<br>
But the fact is, Randy Johnson (And ARod and Griffey) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> WANTED</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to be traded.  If RJ had been traded and had not make countless statements about wanting to get away from Seattle I could care less about what could be passed off as a slump.<br>

I'll I have been shown by Ullricis a statistical report of A FEW of the overall stats of the 98 season...a season in which the M's SUCKED as a TEAM.....and a season in which Randy Johnson lead the pitching department of his team in SEVERAL categories INCLUDING most strikeouts .....yet Ullric comes out of left field with bullshit statements that would have anyone who reads this thread assume Randy Johnson purposefully LOST games..and that if we all &quot;read between the lines&quot; we will find the &quot;smoking gun&quot;......that is CLEARLY NOT THE CASE...and once again...I have yet to see a single shread of evidence backing up your bullshit remarks....<br>
<br>
you upset his ERA, or his win/lose record was not what you feel it should have been...oh well, to bad.....welcome to being a fan of a team or player......but at no point, does, or has, his performence ever been second guessed with regards to &quot;purposefully loosing&quot;...well ...untill now......<br>
<br>
that is why I called /BULLSHIT...as a fan of baseball it is my duty...<br>
