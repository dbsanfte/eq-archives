I would like to present a few general details, and some guild history.<br><br>* Greater Faymart was the only shopping center. There was very little trading in EC on SolRo, while EC is the main trade zone on the other servers I have played at.<br><br>* Planes booked six months in advance, many guilds beeing booked for several weeks of planetime, and the idea that two guilds could ever be in the same plane without screaming at each other was very seldom popular.<br><br>* Always train Karnor's right zone, never the left! On SolRo, unlike other servers I have seen, the left zone was considered safe and was not to be trained. This worked both on the inside and the outside, you count the zone that is to your left when you face the zoneline.<br><br>* There was/are a lot of europeeans on SolRo, mostly german. There was quite a bit of shouting and OOC:ing in german, something that some people found inconsiderate. A few germans on the other hand considered it offensive to speak english in their precense.<br><br><br>Some Guild history<br><br>During EverQuests first year or so I was in a swedish guild called Svearike. For a time we was allied with a french guild called Fellowship of Lotz.<br><br>Back in the good old days there was two &quot;UberGuilds&quot; on SolRo - the only guilds that could kill Naggy and Vox, and they had many level 50:s in their ranks. Oh wow. These guilds was called Heroes Of The Seven Suns, and Veni Vedi Vici. Populary called HOSS and VVV.<br><br>Later HOSS moved to the first split server, Druzzil Ro, while VVV remained a uber-guild but was eroded by time and disbanded a few months ago. Parts of VVV later made a new guild called Midnight, together with parts of a guild called Mystical Legacy (ML), that had been mighty for a while but lost it's momentum when the guildleader dissapeared with the guildfund and many left in dissapointment. ML was originally founded by a splinter group from HOSS.<br><br>Two other Uberguilds entered the scene - Paradigm (PD) and The Twelwe Moons (TTM).<br><br>Svearike decayed after the leader quitted the game, and later both Svea and Lotz was splitted up in two guilds each: one lowlevel guild that kept the original name, and one highlevel guild with a new name. The highlevel Lotz merged with TTM and became Darkwind, while the highlevel Svea still goes under the name Landslide.<br><br>Darkwind and Landslide are both on this server, while Svearike and Fellowship of Lotz still lives on at Solusek Ro. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/upereginfalcon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Peregin Falcon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/21/00 11:56:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/gdawg93/ANIM36.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: About SolRo</span><hr size=1> Then, BoC hopped onto the scene, nothing would be the same.

I don't know their history very well, but they seem to be an old-built guild, and not a circumstances-built guild like most &quot;ubers&quot; are. You should check their website at www.guildparadigm.com to be sure ...<br><br><br>I can relate a bit more of the History between Svearike and Fellowship of Lotz.<br><br>I am one of the two Lotz leader (the other being my dear cousin Vassago, A.K.A. Lanae/Lwenduil), and I was nicely hunting in Crushbone, when my level allowed me to &quot;solo&quot; (<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) Crush&amp;DVinn's tower. And I met a very nice wizard, with whom I shared the spot without any problem. His name was Pheus Undermoon, and he stays one of the nicest persons I have ever met on Solusek Ro. <br><br>Most people don't know about the /guildstatus command, but I had a hotkey for that, that was quite handful to write down the names of the guildleaders I was meeting (I was about to make a database of all Solro's guildleaders, but I never ended that project). I just did it on Pheus, and realized he was the leader of Svearike! I had seen some of Svearike members before, but I didn't know they were all Swedish-speaking. <br>As Pheus and I were speaking more and more, we became VL friends, expanding the chat on our RL also... and thus decided to try to make some kind of &quot;alliance&quot; between our two guilds.<br><br>The first event we did was a little raid in upper guk, which was *very* disturbed by the fact people can't just listen to leaders' and officers' orders, but anyway we had fun, the most important thing isn't it ?<br><br>We then made a few other events (I can't rmemeber exactly, to be honnest), mostly for fun, and mid-level based.<br><br>Then Pheus had to stop EQ, and he gave the leadership to someone else. And then the Dark Ages arrived, kinda simultaneously for our guilds. <br>Some people were clearly &quot;powergamers&quot;, while others were more &quot;casual players&quot;.<br><br>The high level players of Lotz first formed a guild name &quot;Forgiven Souls&quot; (although I am not sure they've ever been forgiven <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), which then merged with TTM to form Darkwind, like Edeina said.<br><br><br>Nowdays, I stay a quite happy EQ player. I still am on Solusek Ro, a server where I was born and where I will die, my home for ever.<br><br>A big hello to all former and actual Lotz members, aswell as people from Svearike/Landslide who will remember me.

The other shrugged.  <br><br>'Well, our point is to be fun, so we have to make it silly,' I reminded them.<br><br>'All I know is that it has to have bunnies.'<br><br>'Well fine, how about...

I was scrambling at this point.<br><br>'All I know,' recalled my friend, 'is that in the good old days, before the wipe, Lords of Chaos used to shout out &quot;bunnies!&quot; and &quot;chaos!&quot;.  Let's try and capture that.'<br><br>'Fine then.. Bunnies of Chaos.'<br><br>'BINGO!'<br></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br>And then I wrote this when we got #guildapproved:<br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> When Veeshan rended her claws through the planet that was to become what we call Norrath, she destroyed a great, thriving empire.. the empire of the Bunnies. Their cities teemed with life and commerce, and their people lead a happy life. Her claws tore asunder everything that the bunnies had built. <br><br>In the Age of Turmoil, when signs of this great Bunny Empire were unearthed, a small group of adventurers realized the terror and horror forced upon these peaceful creatures. Filled with hatred and the need for revenge they formed an alliance, to take back the land so forcebly taken by the bitch Veeshan. They are... the Bunnies of Chaos.<br><br>[insert cackle here]</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------<br>Our guild grew slowly, since many members of Solusek Ro were well entrenched in their current guilds, unwilling to move due to strong ties of friendship or obligation.  But then that all went out the window when one day I offered them a chance to quietly split servers to the soon-coming Terris Thule.  I let the offer stand for a week, and my list of members grew from 10 to 70.  People wanted OFF the server, badly.  <br><br>And so, my Bunnies moved to Terris Thule, and we had the greatest week of our lives.  Then, near the middle of that week, a certain Bunny revolted against us all,  because he felt everyone was turning against him.  Well, he wasn't wrong, but who could blame us?  It was Mauldoon.  And so Mauldoon proceeded to make all of our lives a living hell.  Long story short, Mauldoon exposed us to the public and the EQ Boards exploded with shouts of favoritism and terrible customer service on Verant's part for letting this happen, and he also sent in IRC logs to my bosses at VI of various things I supposedly said (which were wildly exaggerated and modified).  I lost my job, and the Bunnies were sent back to misery on Solusek Ro.<br><br>The guild nearly died in the transfer, with people quickly returning to their old guilds, leaving us with a total population of 7.  I was ready to give up, ready to throw in the towel and apply for PD.  The guild kicked me in the ass and said, 'Hell no!' and rallied to re-invent the Bunnies.<br><br>Amazingly enough, the Bunnies have flourished beyond my wildest dreams.  We've become the family I always dreamed a guild should be.  We've also become a capable machine able to tear apart most mobs tossed our way, soon to rip apart everything in Norrath.  We shout 'PEMIS', 'BAGINA' and 'hop hop' across zones for no particular reason at all.  We rellish in our uniqueness and revel in our insanityDJFHSDKJHGDFLKGHDFKLHDLFKHD.  I love this guild.  And finally, we've all gotten our dream: a new server, legit this time, no complaints, no Mauldoons, no going back.  <br><br>Bunnies, we're home.   <p><IMG SRC="http://www.melanierawn.com/irena/jiji-sig.gif" WIDTH=371 HEIGHT=86 ALT="Jihan Wolfwalker - Guildleader - Bunnies of Chaos"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383836><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Qlaini</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/24/00 3:36:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> To the leader of Bunnies of Chaos...</span><hr size=1> Did ALL of your guild move to the new server?
