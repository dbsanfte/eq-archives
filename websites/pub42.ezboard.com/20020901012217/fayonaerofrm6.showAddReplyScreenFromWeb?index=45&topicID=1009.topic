I am the second 60 troll warrior on the server below EW's babaz or zabab or something of that sort. But that doesnt mean I changed the way ive been playing, the way ive acted all my EQ life. Im still the happy go lucky troll that hugs you out of the blue. Ive always been that giddy guy that makes you wonder about his sexuality(I am straight btw).<br>
<br>
You say you hardly see the actions I describe and I believe I know why. Guild members rarely ever act negatively towards another guild member and if they do, they're probably kidding around. You, being in one of the best guilds in EQ could not possibly understand the true colors of your guild members. Im not saying EW members are bad people. Theres alot of very nice people in EW. That being said, alot of the members in your guild act the way I described in my earlier post. The &quot;im too good for you&quot; attitude is expressed more than you know. I dont think they mean to change the way they behave or when they are doing it. I think its just human nature and cant be controlled. I call it the &quot;im a hardass&quot; disease. <br>
<br>
Id like to be happy for EW's accomplishments but its hard for me. Its not jealousy,envy,hatred that makes it hard for me. Its that aura that (cant think of the correct word, starts with an E i think) from them after doing what they do. Id love to say &quot;GOOD JOB&quot; and &quot;WELL DONE&quot; but then I feel im doing them wrong by making all their heads grow sooo big and unattractive even more than it is now. And also I doubt they would even care if anyone said &quot;good job&quot; and &quot;well done&quot;. <br>
<br>
Anyway, I still lobsjoo EW, I lubs everyone as long as they have respect for others, even if they arent as uber as you. As I said, we have feelings too...<br>

Edeina have not always been &quot;uber&quot;. And I have other chars as well, on various servers. I have seen alot of EQ from the non-uber side. So my difference in perspective doesn't only come from the EW people being my guildmates.<br>
<br>
During the year this server have existed and EW have existed on it we have had well over 100 active members. Of these, at least one had a really bad attitude. Totally full of himself, like you describe - only worse. Like Selwen allready said, we kicked him out eventually. I don't doubt that a few more have a really snotty mentality against anyone not in the guild. These people are however a really small minority, I'm sure it's a single digit number. <br>
<br>
On the other hand, most of us, probably all of us, have at one time or another being percieved like total assholes living down to each and every of Dreadnok's stereotypes. Usually we can't help it, people just assume we have bad attitude because we kill mobs they would like to kill but can't. Some of us have themselves to blame, getting angry over something and behaving very badly over it and then get remembered forever as a asshole over a single or a few incidents. Usually it's not something really bad like training&amp;killstealing, but rather getting trained &amp; killstealed and then yell &quot;well, I'm in EW you stupid newbie, you will never see NToV&quot; or something similary stupid. Of course everyone will remember that shout, noone will remember why he shouted it or that his groupmates from the same guild was polite all the time in spite of the trains and taunts.<br>
 <p>Love, Edeina<br>

I suppose I've been on an extended vacation from EQ.  There was something that really bothered me about Dread's posts.  I don't think it was the fact that I could relate to a number of his pop psychology assessments.  He successfully pointed out the general mental mechanics of humans when placed in an environment that connates success with materialistic acquisition.  That's not terribly difficult to do and isn't a very accurate measure of one's intellect.  <br>
<br>
You see, as Dread finds himself examining others, I find myself examining him.  Is it an inferiority complex outside the anonymity of cyberspace that promotes such pompous and derogatory rhetoric from someone who is obviously speaking to his peer group?  With such an overwhelming capacity for analysis and judgement, surely there are more productive uses for his gifts.  Why waste such valuable insight on the individuals that frequent this board?  How did they become his test subjects?<br>
<br>
A funny thing about arrogance...there seem to be a couple of types of it.  Some people present themselves in an aloof fashion and their ambivalence to the world around them is obvious.  Then there are the arrogant people who continually tell you they are arrogant.  The latter is definately Dread's group.  That's unfortunate, and here's a bit of analysis of my own.  A person proclaims and defends their arrogance because it circumvents any arguments that bring into question the traits in which they have put so much pride.  The goal is for you to argue with the arrogance, therefore already being at a disadvantage because you have already conceded the traits.  He's half way to selling you on the idea that he's somehow superior to others.  (I know because I've used that tactic before...and that's why I didn't like reading Dread's remarks.  Not that I found them offensive, but he forced me to look at a part of me that I can't stand, which he reflected so graciously and eloquently).<br>
<br>
I used to have a saying...&quot;If I can't dazzle you with my brilliance, I'll baffle you with my bullshit.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'll let each of you make your own determination into which catagory Dread's remarks should fall.  And I'll leave it to Dread to decide where mine should fall.<br>
<br>
Dread, a word of advice...Play whatever game gets you through life with the least resistance.  But when a person sees through your shit, it's time to come clean or shut the fuck up.  Have a nice day, and don't forget that there are people in the world that are more intelligent, better looking, more articulate, and more emotionally stable than you are.  Then show a little gratitude for the good fortunes that you have. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ublizzdatroll.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Blizz Da Troll</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Regular Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(3/6/02 5:46:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1009.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: At what point in your Everquest career do you become....</span><hr size=1> Im pretty sure alot of EW members dislike me.
