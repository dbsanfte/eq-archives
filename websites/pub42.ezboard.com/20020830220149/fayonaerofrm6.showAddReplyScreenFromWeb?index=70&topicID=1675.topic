Enjoy.<br>
<br>
I am deeply grieved, more than I thought I could be by a computer game, at tonights events. I don't know how it happened, but evidently rumors were going around that I was leaving IO. This was not the case. I am moving, getting a new job, and planning a wedding for the next 3 months and it is going to be nearly impossible for me to play. I thought I tried to stress that I was NOT leaving IO, but evidently I failed. <br>
<br>
As the night unfolded, I logged in to find a raid on Innoruuk being prepared for. I had died earlier that morning in the depths of Jagged Pine Forest, and before I had time to mount a corpse recovery, I received a call from my fiance saying that she needed me to pick her up early from work. So when I logged on tonight I frantically tried to find a port from the nexus to Surefall with no help from guildmembers, so I used the nexus port to North Karana. I ran to Jagged Pine Forest, found my corpse, got a rez, and was back at the surefall druid portal in record time. However, Zaltak said that he couldn't wait for me. So I started sending tells to different people, including deecee and darus, requesting a port up at some point. Everyone suggested that I send a tell to Darus, which I did. I waited a few minutes and sent another tell. And again. And again. Meanwhile, Adiene was sent tells from Darus concerning me, and I had several people ask Zaltak if he had any hate stones on him for Adiene to pick me up...he would not respond to anyone. I do need some people to fill in what tells were sent, and I would love for you to post them.<br>
<br>
I ran back to the Spire in North Karana and proceeded to wait for the next hour and a half, periodically sending tell to darus and other members. It became obvious that Darus would not respond to me or other people trying to get him to port me up, and he freely admits that he made an effort to keep me out of Hate.<br>
<br>
Now the issue with moderating the channel, I am so sorry about that. It was not done maliciously or with any intent at all. I had been waiting for nearly 2 hours and was just typing in commands, and I had no idea what /mod did. Here is the log of that part of the event - I have not cut anything out, and you can check with Xman - he can say if I'm lying or not:<br>

Now my response to Darus when he questioned me afterwards was not pretty and I'm not proud of it. Here is how the entire conversation went:<br>

<br>
I was very upset with Darus, and I think that I had every right to be upset. From my point of view, for no reason I have just been denied a chance to get my second epic. I had done nothing wrong and was being punished. Darus never bothered to talk to me, or to tell me what he thought was going to happen (me leaving IO). He just assumed. He claims that he never recieved 3 or 4 tells from me, and that it was all just a misunderstanding so I was assuming things. I KNOW for a fact that several people tried to to talk to him about getting me up to Hate. And he admits this. And yet he couldn't take one moment in 2 hours to explain this to me. I must not be worth very much to him. I have poured myself into this guild like nothing I have ever done in a game. I have tried to do whatever I could, whether it was questing or dying or corpse recovery or faction, anything. I have been honest and trustworthy. I have not taken advantage of anyone, I have not dealt shadily with anyone. I have defended Darus and IO on the boards. I have done my best to my fullest for Imperial Order. And yet I'm not worth the effort for him to send me a tell explaining why he's denying me a chance at my epic. How many of you have your coldain ring? I got nothing from that except the joy of seeing my friends happy.<br>
<br>
Either more has gone on behind my back than I can ever be aware of, or Darus was never really my friend. I feel so hurt right now. I hate leaving you all this way - it's the antithesis of how I wanted to leave on this break. I have had great times with all of you, and I had no desire to leave.<br>
<br>
I will repost this on Ayonae Ro General Message board if this gets deleted, as kicked member's posts often are.<br>
<br>
I hope that enough of you have gotten to know me well enough that you can voice your opinions that I was unfairly deguilded and that Darus needs to be less hasty in his decisions. In addition, he needs to talk to an individual member and not take out his frustrations on one of the most helpful members of the guild because his roommate inadvertantly hurt his feelings.<br>

I was attempting to be civil about this, but since Darus is an asshole, here goes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Him being kicked had nothing to do with the epic, hate, or anything like that. It was the simple lone act of moding the raid channel, and then his answer...<br>
<br>
His answer said that not only did he do it purposely, but that he did it vindictively. Considering some of kincaidia's past actions, that simply was the straw that broke it all.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
My answer did NOT say that I did it on purpose. I said, and I quote, &quot;So you finally decide to speak to me?&quot;<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://csserver2.wheaton.edu/~nlloyd/pic2.gif"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
This in no way implies that I did it on purpose. After sending Darus a multitude of tells, he finally spoke to me...so I said &quot;so you finally speak to me&quot;...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Considering some of Kincaidia's past actions, that simply was the straw the broke it all.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
All I can say is, What...the...heck...List them. If there are so many things that were horrible, write them here. Air out my laundry. They will all be news to me.<br>
<br>
As for me threatening him and trying to blackmail him, that is a load of bull. Nothing like that EVER happened. He was playing dumb, so I told him that other people have been sending him tells as well. Not only that, he cut and pasted completely unrelated messages into that little 3 line image. They're even in the wrong order. It's a nice attempt at making me look bad, but when you cut and paste them like that, you can do anything you want. Not even that, those were the most &quot;incriminating&quot; line that Darus could pull out of his screenshots - no foul language, no threats, no petty insults. I had EVERY intention of trying to settle this. But once again, Darus just wouldn't give me the time of day.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I went through my logs to find this gem:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Didnt screen last one..but it was along the lines of &quot;If you just retag me I wont drag this out in public&quot;<br>
<br>
Quite frankly after those comments I gave up, Kincaidia obviously had NO real intention of wanting to resolve the issue.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This is how it actually read:<br>
[Fri Jul 26 01:58:33 2002] You told Darus, 'I don't want this to go anywhere. I want retagged and forget this whole thing happened.'<br>
<br>
Sounds like I'm blackmailing him, huh? Like I'm threatening to wreak havok if he doesn't let me back in...No, it sounds like someone who has no idea what just happened to him and doesn't want to lose his friends.<br>
<br>
And as for &quot;nothing to do with the epic, hate, or anything like that&quot;...This is a screenshot of what darus said to me...and I'm not going to cut and paste and rearrange the order and omit things that don't work for my case like Darus did.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://csserver2.wheaton.edu/~nlloyd/pic1.gif"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
So there is a conflict: Darus said to me that he intentionally kept me out of Hate, which I might add is the biggest insult I can be given right now besides getting guildremoved, and yet he says that it has nothing to do with it. <br>
<br>
Most of you know me quite well. I am your friend and your guildmate. I'm not lying. I have screenshots and logs of what happened, I have people that I was in near-constant tells with, talk to Xman when he logs on...the mod thing was an accident and he chuckled at it. Darus is taking out his anger at someone else on me and it is just plain wrong.<br>

<br>
I agree that someone's personal appearance should not affect or ever be brought into the game. However, when someone has security issues and are in a place of leadership, bad results happen, and it becomes an issue in game. Darus is insecure, and if someone so much as suggests that he made a wrong decision or awarded something to the wrong person, they are on his shit list...<br>
<br>
I did leave things out - about how he cut and pasted different tells of mine to make it look like I threatened him. He lies to protect the bubble he has made for himself.<br>
<br>
On that note, after I get married and settled down, 59 Ranger looking for guild who doesn't have one insecure asshole dictator for a leader.<br>
<br>
And to the other members of IO who I have grown to love, I'll miss you all while I'm away, and I hope I find things different when I get back. And I hope other people don't take out their frustrations with Darus on you.<br>

i.e.  If you've ever been wronged, you're not ALLOWED to defend yourself, but must suck it up and accept the slander and lies that everyone eventually makes up about you.  That's the life of the anonymous (anyone who uses the internet).<br>
<br>
Every single person who has ever defended themselves when they've been wronged here is ALWAYS, and I mean ALWAYS met with &quot;I now have no respect for you!&quot; from everyone.  Which logically tells me that no one is &quot;allowed&quot; to defend themselves.  No matter how much evidence they have that they're innocent, no matter how calm and rational they display the facts.  No matter what they do, the witch hunt will live on.<br>
<br>
No one EVER even TRIES to see the victums side of things, they ALWAYS jump on them from trying to set things straight.  They ALWAYS take the side of the person that wronged the poster, because the poster is trying to defend themselves.  Why are they defending themselves in a public place?  Because those who wronged them paint an incorrect picture of the victum to anyone they talk to about the subject.  ALLOWING someone to think that you've done something wrong when you haven't is the greatest crime of all.  Could you, the reader, stand it if someone out there spouted lies about you to anyone they met who was curious about the subject?  Wouldn't you, the reader, want everyone to know that they're not true?  Or would you, the reader, just sit back and ALLOW everyone hearing the story to believe it and not care?  Myself, I know that I couldn't stand knowing that someone out there thinks I've done something wrong when I have not done such a thing.<br>

This board serves only one purpose.  To piss others off.  To slander others.  To create witch hunts.  To waist good peoples time.  To entertain all the people that love to see others wither in misery, then to kick them a few more times while they're down on top of it all.  Nothing good has come of this board.  What little information that is put forth, what little discusion and debate that takes place (the whole reason boards were created in the first place), is all drown out in flames, hateful posts, and &quot;I like pie&quot;.

Wrong.  Feel free to try again next week.<br>
<br>
It's funny how much of a conclusion you can draw without knowing all the facts.  Kincaidia already posted this on our boards, where it was dealt with.  The outcome was not what he wanted so he thought it best to bring it here to try and slander Darus and IO.<br>
<br>
I said this was a damned fool stupid thing to do.  I never said that I lost respect for him.  On our boards my words were something to the tune of &quot;I like you, I trust you and I respect you&quot;.  This however was the WRONG way for him to do things.<br>
<br>
Are you in IO?  Were you online when all of this transpired?  Did you send a tell to Kincaidia asking him what happened?  Did you see him say &quot;this is bullshit someone stick up for me&quot; in the raid channel?  Do you really have any clue what the story is or would you rather jump on ME for 'persecuting' Kincaidia?<br>
<br>
As for your cynical musings about the internet and these boards, I have no comment.  Sufficed to say, I like pie. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/utunnelratx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TunnelRatX</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scribe</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/29/02 7:42:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1675.topic&index=83>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.fearlessblack.net/images/Maulo004.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Darus</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;ncid=529&amp;e=5&amp;cid=529&amp;u=/ap/20020729/ap_en_mo/clones_ripoff_1">Cloned Pirates Return to Canada for breastfeeding!</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Personally, I don't think I'd want to be in a guild led by one person that &quot;gave orders&quot;.  When someone &quot;gives me orders&quot;, I tend to respond with something to the effect of Fuck Off.  I wouldn't last long in a dictatorship type guild I guess.  Come to think of it, I'm not sure why my current guild keeps me around.<br>

Oh well, good luck with your wedding and with your gaming when you return.  Maybe Darus will have  achange of heart by the time you get back and ya'll can make up and it'll be warm and fuzzy again.<br>
