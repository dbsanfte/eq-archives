I know, I know, but it did get me thinking. Does society as a whole think of homosexuality as a deviant state? Or as something unnatural? Or, like myself, think it's a perfectly natural state, and only come in to light as of recent years due to the ever increase in freedom to live how you damn want.. true to yourself.<br>

Not everyone thinks it is &quot;evil&quot; or wrong.  Some people think it's wrong, that's fine, just like others think it's acceptable, which is also fine.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, homosexuality is fine, so long as you don't push it on me.  If you respect other peoples opinion on the matter then everyone &quot;should&quot; get along.<br>

Certainly ancient Greece celebrated homosexualty. Plato went so far as to<br>
describe the love of men to men as a higher love then men to women. There<br>
is evidence that Alexander the Great's elite cavalry unit &quot;the Companions&quot; <br>
was openly homosexual.<br>
<br>
I have a personal theory about the acceptance of certain behaviors. I believe<br>
that anything that is a positive survival trait starts out as a smart thing to do<br>
which over several generations becomes habit and then dogma. In farming<br>
societies, having kids is important so as to keep the farm going. Kids are<br>
your old age pension (i.e. working the farm so as to feed you while you help<br>
in less back breaking ways). Homosexuality would not be the best survival<br>
tactic for such societies. <br>
<br>
Robert Silverberg made an observation in his &quot;Book of Skulls&quot; which I thought<br>
was interesting. Silverberg observed that homosexuality is more accepted in<br>
urban cultures and incest in rural (incest due to the distances between families<br>
and the natural tendancy for kids to &quot;experiment&quot;). Interesting idea but I have<br>
no idea if its true of not.<br>
<br>
As for the idea that there is an &quot;increase in freedom to live as you want&quot;, I am not<br>
certain that is correct. I think some things are more accepted and some things less.<br>
The targets of bigotry and intolerance have shifted over the last 50 years but<br>
I don't think society is any more tolerant then it was before.<br>

I tend to not use it in game/msg boards as people can't read your face as you say it (for the true meaning of what you meant by gay) nor can they accurately(sp?) interpret whether or not it was a directly prejudice towards their sexuality.<br>
<br>
For example, I have a friend that likes to do stupid things i.e. light his hair on fire with a cigarette lighter - my comment to that would be &quot;Ben that was purely gay...&quot;<br>
<br>
Was I calling him a homosexual because he did something stupid?  No, how &quot;I&quot; interpret it is that it was an extremely lame and odd thing to do.  The English vocabulary has adopted many words to different situations.  Such is the word fuck - don't get me started as Adam Sandler can best sum it up in &quot;Uses of the word Fuck.mp3&quot;<br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Yes. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I agree.  Sure he may not speak for a society as a whole, but folks - this isn't a problem that just came up.  A society as a whole DOES have this mentality.  There are what, 250 million in the USA, and very frequently a death based solely on sexual orientation happens, as well as many other crimes/actions take part such as the Southern Church Burnings.  Although not necissarily gay related, these actions show just how neanderthalic our &quot;modern&quot; society is. Granted not EVERY single person will have this gay bashing view.  We are on a moderated message board - maybe 1% of the American population will read this and share our views.  What about the other 99% - left to fight it out like dogs...<br>

In most societies, by and large, (including Calvinist-decended America), homosexuality is considered 'deviant' by a large segment of the population, but it is also undeniably true that homoexuality has been with us throughout recorded history, so it would be a stretch to call it 'unnatural'.  And, homosexuality has been more-or-less accepted, or at least given a 'niche', in many societies that don't appear, on the surface, to tolerate it.  It is only in the West, in the past fifty years that we have paid more *conscious* attention to homosexuality, but societies such as India have had an official 'third gender' (hermaphrodite, which encompasses everything from eunuchs to transvestites to effeminite male homosexuals) for centuries. <br>
<br>
But since what you really seem to be interested in is the server population's *opinion* of homosexuality...<br>
<br>
I think that a small, but significant, portion of the population is simply born, (either genetically, or by their hormonal/prenatal environment), to be homosexual, bisexual, or transgendered.  There is a pretty hefty body of evidence in animal models to back this up, from population surveys of mating pairs of migratory birds, to Dr. John Money's (at John's Hopkins) prenatal hormone studies on sheep.  In my opinion, to classify these people as 'deviant' would be as rediculous as classifying people with, say, an RH-negative blood type (rare, and definitely *not* a survival advantage, but persisting in the population as a normally fixed trait regardless) as deviants.  I think the increased 'official' awareness and tolererance of gay, bi, and trans folks can only be a *good* thing, as it addresses an issue that has always existed in our society anyway.  And to mangle a famous quote, if we're not doing it out in the street and frightening the horses, what does it matter what adults do in the privacy of their romantic lives, anyway?<br>
<br>
I recently read in the newspaper that a high level government official in Norway just married his long term companion, and a minimum of fuss was made about it.  I think that this is as it should be, and that people should simply 'live and let live' as far as other folks sexual/gender orientations go...<br>
<br>
I could go a lot longer on this topic, but think I will save it for the (probably inevitable) replies.<br>

- I think that's the funniest comment, and one that's said a lot. Not to bash you at all Skorle, but how would you define 'push it on me'? By homosexual people saying that they are homosexual? Or talking about it? Or by 'hitting' on you? <br>
It's ok as long as it's not in my face. That kind of attitude makes me chuckle. Because, that means it is not OK. <br>
Afierra, I found what you said real interesting about interpreting the word gay. Yes, it has different meanings and is interpreted differently among different people. But for most, sadly, it is still a word used as a form of abuse, in conjunction with homosexuality. IE Gay is used by most to be different in a bad way. So, someone acts stupid.. and thus you apply the word 'gay' to them, addressing the homosexual population as a deviant act, and suggesting that what had been committed is also a deviant act. Sure, you may suggest that gay/queer also means to be strange, and a word used often in a sensible context. But, of this age, and the form it's used, I don't think so. <p>Halo 57th Beguiler<br>

Guys, when you think about how uncomfortable it might make you to have a man make a suggestion or a pass at you, consider that this is how some of us females feel <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   every day of our lives </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, due to the fact that many guys seem to take this as a 'right', and will get downright ugly if the female in question makes it clear that she is not interested... <br>

(American) Society as a whole views homosexuality as deviant.  So do most Christian/Jewish/Islamic societies, from what I can tell.  Religions that have been persecuted tend to feel that way, as homosexuality doesn't tend to produce offspring.  Morality aside, a large majority of our behavior comes from the basic urge/need to procreate.  <br>
Whether people approve or disapprove, most find it deviant in some form or another.  As a word, deviant encompasses a lot of meaning, so take that to mean what you will.  The large majority of people I have met, and I've met a large cross-section of the US population, still see it as a choice in some way/shape/or form.  That's how I'm referring to it, at least.  <br>
<br>
Calling someone/something 'gay' or a 'fag' is difficult to judge nowadays.  Originally calling someone a fag was tantamount to calling someone a nigger, it's a hate word.  The gay movement incorporated most of the hate words into its popular lingo on purpose.  Being called a 'queer' became a matter of pride.  Still, it's not really as accepted for someone outside of the movement to use it as someone inside the movement.  A byproduct of that word assimilation is that they've become very mainstream to use for kids.  It's not one of the four letter words that your parents will punish you for.  So it's floated about very lightly.  I'm sure it must be awful for &quot;closeted&quot; kids in highschool now more than ever.  Calling someone a fag is very common but it's still a derogatory word.To know that your friends and peers think that what you are is wrong hurts; to be reminded of it time and time again nowadays...<br>
<br>
If anyone cares about my own personal opinions =) I don't mind discussing them.  I'm an actor by trade, and male.   I majored in music in college where I was one of 3 straight males in my entire year.  You don't last very long as a man in theatre without closely examining your own sexuality, (especially when you get more men hitting on you then women <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) and I'm both sure and comfortable in my orientation. I'm married, in fact.  I have more gay male friends then straight, and I still laugh my ass off when I get told &quot;Oh shut up, breeder&quot;<br>
I think homosexuality is very natural, and not a choice you make.  <br>
I can deal with people calling things 'gay' but I still see 'fag' as a hate word, and I tell people so.  I get a lot of '?'s in pickup groups when someone calls a pull (or loot, or whatever) gay, and I reply with &quot;Yes, that most certainly is a homosexual sword/axe/Feign Death/whatever.&quot; /chuckle.  I don't preach, but I like to poke at what people say and do on the off chance that they might actually start thinking about it.<br>
<br>

That is thier way of life, and for the most part it is a single generation.  I was brought up being taught that this is wrong.  Since becoming a thinking adult I still think it is wrong.  If asked my opinion I will say I feel it is wrong.  Will I stop being friends with the people I know who are gay?  No.  Thier choice and I am not uncomfortable with how they live.  That is thier thing, thier lives.  Bottom line...Deviant? Yes. Sorry its how I feel.<br>

Spoken like a true hypocrite. If you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> REALLY</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> were trying to pursue meaningful discussion, then why did you start this in the NAG section?<br>
<br>
Anyway, let me explain myself. First off, this board is public. I can write whatever I want, without asking permission of who started the thread. You started this thread after overhearing some bigoted language. It must have offended you, otherwise you would not have started this thread. Maybe this is just a discussion of Philosophy or Anthropology, but nothing pushes my buttons more than someone who will complain about being offended or implications of being offended while at the same time having demonstrated a track record of being offensive or insensitive. I personally will never give a crap about any token gripe or ploy for attention you will ever share on these boards, Halo, after your total lack of compassion over the events of 9/11. <br>
<br>
Your &quot;Do as I say, not as I do&quot; additude on your last post even futhers my utter distaste for you. <br>
