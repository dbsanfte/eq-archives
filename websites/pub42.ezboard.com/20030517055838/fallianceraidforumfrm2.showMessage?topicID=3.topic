My purpose here is to come up with a Means of establishing a better system for the mass raids and the protection of our healers and enchanters...without whom we would have no success.<br>
I saw on many occasions mezzes being broken purposefully...this is going to be hard to avoid if people are unable to follow the simple directions given to them.<br>
Use the Damn assist key already!<br>
I took it upon myself to perform a few experiments and generally observe during the Hate raid to see if the Clerics/Enchanters could be protected by Tanks.<br>
In some cases the players were beyond my protection <br>
( specifically a moment when 2 mobs went for Yandadara at once..i could not help her at all)<br>
There were some occasions when a mob was after one of the Enchanters/Clerics and they were unable to mez/heal due to being attacked...so I stepped into the fray to attack the mob to gain its agro..once i got the agro for about 5-10 seconds I dropped my attack and told the enchanter to mez. I stood there getting pummeled until the chanter could mez.<br>
THis actually worked succesfully on more than a few occasions.<br>
The drawback to this is that it requires the full time attention of the tank..and is only needed when there are multiple mobs pulled to the camp. When only single mobs were pulled I jumped into the action to help.<br>
It also requires detailed attention to be paid by the &quot;Protector&quot; to be aware of whether a mob is attacking a cleric/Enchanter or not.<br>
Excellent communication must be key as well..for the &quot;Protector&quot; must be able to quickly inform the enchanter that the mob has been agro'd to allow for the mez.<br>
This can be simply a Hot key set up pertaining to each and every enchanter on the raid.<br>
I do think this is a strategy worth exploring and perfecting...but beyond this we need players to follow the simple rule of using the ASSIST Key. If you do not know how to do this please ask and have it set up. All too often i watched MEZZED mobs get attacked and then go and kill the enchanter who mezzed it. This MUST stop for us to be successful in any future raids.<br>
If it doesnt stop , In the future I am going to be watching for these infractions and fingering the player responsible. This type of disciplinary action is similar to a Platoon officer telling the rest of the squad that a member is &quot;sluffing&quot;..i think you all know the results. Must it come to this?<br>
In closing, let me hear your feedback on the pros and cons of my idea of setting up a &quot;Protection group&quot; for the Clerics/Enchanters on raids.<br>
I grew quite weary of Yandadara dying 10 times..and Niskin needn't have died at all In my opinion.<br>

<br>
Until everyone's using the assist key properly, I think it'd be a really good idea to have a protection type group for the clerics/chanters.  Those same people could also be watching for repeat offenders on breaking mezzes, etc., 'cause it really needs to stop.  I think casters should start helping us on that as well - if you catch someone breaking a mez early, I say report 'em to a raid leader.  I don't know if it's people trying to &quot;KS&quot; and get exp for their group or what, but there's really no excuse for the amount of chaos we have due to mezzes being broken on multi-pulls.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Just wanted to make a little addition here and say I'd be happy to volunteer to help with the protection of our casters on raids.  If there's one thing Rangers are good at, it's ticking mobs off and getting them away from casters.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/usionach.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sionach</A> at: 3/25/02 3:46:33 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/usoggin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Soggin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#0000FF>(3/27/02 10:15:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fallianceraidforumfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Tactics and strategy in Hate</span><hr size=1> 1 Full group of taunting tanks could have saved us all I think but hindsight is always 20/20 heheh Say 3 ppl for chanters and 3 for clerics.Most of the times we got wiped we had a mob pulled away from the main battle and mezzed.&lt;Which pissed me off even more btw that someone would go out of their way to go over n break a mez.&gt; But if we have chanters/clerics spread out a lil bit then each has his/her own heal and mez area kind of like a field of fire.lol Granted, the clerics' group prolly also could have a person designated to be a bodyguard so to speak but that person MUST watch the cleric's health bar in the middle of every battle.Chanters on the other hand have tons less AC and HP than clerics and if get breathed on by a planar fly we go down lol.So a lil more protection for chanters may be in order.The times I tried to heal Niskin with Soggy when I saw him dropping,the mob merely dropped Nis then commenced to beating the hell out of Soggin.lol Sogg loses a good bit more when he dies even with those kickass Cano rezzes so after the third Soggy death,if I saw there was no savin Niskin I just let him die.lol <br>
     But Agreed Naralli,Something must be done.I love the planar experience even tho I've only been on a few.But if this continues,I'm going to have to pass on furute ones simply due to the fact that folks either don't pay enough attention to the pullers and the mezzers to know what the target is, or just don't seem to care.If you don't know how to make an assist key,please ask.It's not showing your ignorance at not being able to make one,it's asking for advice.It's is on the other hand showing your STUPIDITY if you don't bother to ask.  <p>I came here to drink beer and kick ass....and I'm almost out of beer.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ugwenwyvar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gwenwyvar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Song Bird</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#0000FF>(3/27/02 11:31:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fallianceraidforumfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Tactics and strategy in Hate</span><hr size=1> The bards are best suited for watching after the enchanters.

I don't know if it is actually possible to get aggro off a cleric or chanter quick enough to matter.  Usually I have around 1400 hps.  So I die pretty quick.  No time at all to tell someone that I am being whacked.  hehe  The info I have is that all the points you heal someone the mob looks at as if you had damaged him for the same amount.  If you are in a group with heavy damage, you have caused that mob some serious pain.  (Not actual)  I really appreciate the concern, but this is the way the game goes.  I don't know that there is any other way to do it.  Honestly, a cleric and a chanter know that already, hehe.  It happens whether we are in Hate, Fear, Velks, Kael, etc.  Of course it is great that we have Canoen with his stick around to help us absorb the loss of exp.  When we are in a big important raid I have no offensive spells up, just different healing spells depending on who I am healing.  Last Saturday just happened to be my day to die.  I have actually gone on one or two Fear raids and not died at all, LOL.  There is no blame coming from me that others could have helped me live.  This is just part of the game, and I sure enjoy the fellowship and fun of it and being with folks I feel I know well.  Just to let you all know, I am going to be working harder on my epic and will be glad to help out any others who will be working on theirs as well.  All in all, I would have to say that I really enjoyed myself Saturday, and that is the most important thing.

I know you Clerics and Chanters draw lots of aggro, but having you guys get killed because of broken mezzes is the part that's so painful.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
One thing that *any* class with a Root spell can do to help in these situations is root the mob so you guys can back away.  That would buy some time for tanks to regain aggro or for the mob to be mezzed.  Anyway, just something that popped into my head; maybe it'd help for all of us who can to keep a root mem'd.<br>

People always ask me why I use Celestial heal.. They say its a waste of mana.. I say That when I cast a Celestial on Dinekus or Ramune when I am in the pull group Saves My arse till they can gain enough aggro for me to Complete heal... Not to mention,, Un mezzed mobs do not Look at Celestial as a  threat... I mean,, when Dink has 2 Bubbs of health left,, he still has 2k + Hp's... Keeping him Alive with a Celestial for 24 seconds.. (and the chanter) while the mobs become under control is an ounce of prevention to me =).. And I can do what I do Best when its over,, Meditate heh...<br>
<br>
As far as the Cleric Epic,, I have been seriously considering putting in time and effort to get mine too.. We really do need a couple more for this alliance.. I have the Lord begurgle's crown and Lord grimblox's Signet ring... that is all.. I have the walk thru all printed out but I am still a bit confused about some of the details LOL.. thats why I haven't turned in any of theese pieces as of yet... <br>
<br>
It appears to me that if we can get the numbers together one day or evening here,, (if we have someone who knows exactly what their doing) I can get all the way to the killing of Ixiblatt with those 2 pieces... I may be wrong but to me it looks like its all turn in stuff,, and Kill resulting spawn.. It looks to me like I can get to Ixiblatt within 2 or 3 hours...<br>
<br>
Then of course,, the DREADED Overking DiZok,, and Ragefire..<br>

I use Remedy now, but before I had it I used CelHeal to bring the puller back up to full, especially since he wasn't going to be carrying agro for very long after the mob(s) got back to the main tanks.  Any time after one of the tanks has started to build up hate I can throw out CelHeals all day w/o getting agro.

(although, I suggest you back away from the mob after you cast it... just to help lose agro better...)  I know lots of clerics that don't even memorize this spell... but it really can<br>
save you in a pinch...  <br>
<br>
Anyhoo... my 2 cents...<br>
