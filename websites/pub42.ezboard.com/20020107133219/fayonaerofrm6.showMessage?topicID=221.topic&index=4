A) not all are as lucky as i have been, B) thats sure as hell how i'd like to be treated, C) Everyone, and i mean everyone, does whats in their best intrest, rational self intrest, i do that because there is something in it for me, otherwise i wouldnt do it. Whats in it for me? A) the hopes that one day when im in the gutter somewhere under some ogre( no offense ogre's) that i'll be returned a favor, B) it makes me feel better about myself, call me a jackass but you know its the truth about any nice thing you might do, in the end you feel better because yo helped someone who was in need. i wish this was the case in RL sometimes but i cant exactly go giving 100 bucks to some random guy on the street, i wish i could, but i cant yet being in school still :-) lol.<br>
<br>
I also think there is another reason that i would offer money for a rezz that i wasnt associated with at all or knew the person from any time before. But i think that if one person starts it in the zone, maybe, just maybe it will wear off a little on others and they'll help someone else out in the future, even if its not myself...<br>

<br>
The way i look at it is, these people have the money, 200pp is nothing in the grand scheme of things to them, and they don't want to wait around to find someone for 10-15pp.<br>
<br>
They are paying not so much for my time, but to save theirs. <br>
<br>
I will always port guildies and allies for free. I will port peeps for free if I have down time (rare nowadays). I will buff sow, regen thorns free pretty much whenever I'm asked.<br>
<br>
I don't think people should pay me for ports, but I also feel they should not expect me to do it for free. <br>

Mostly I just took whatever was offered tho.  For now I have my personal clerics with thier sticks (*waves to Shallondra and Scyy*) so getting a res is really no big deal to me.<br>
<br>
As for TPs.. usually if I'm asking for a TP I'm traveling pretty far and need to get there quick.  I'm a big tipper too.. I usually give 100pp for a TP and I get FAST results and generally don't have to wait for them to fill up a full TP group.  I figure it's worth the money to get a TP from FV to Iceclad since it would take a couple hours by boat.<br>

There is no guideline to determine what you should pay, how you should pay etc... it is just a matter of what the TP/Res or whatever is worth to you and how much you can afford. Therefore the buy determines what their time is worth and is willing to pay for it and the seller determines what they are willing to perform their service for.

<br>
If I need a gate I will always /shout Paying 50pp for Gate / Tele to &lt;insert Destination here&gt; please ).  I usually get a ride within 5 mins.  If I am in a big hurry I up it to 100pp and will get a ride quick.  Sometimes one of my friends will here me shouting for a ride and will come to my aid free of charge.  I feel that I won't ask friends to use thier game time to gate me around when I have pp to do it myself.  If they offer I am grateful.  Sometimes folks will gate me and tell me that they only want xpp because that is what they feel it is worth, even other times they will say free)<br>
<br>
I have only paid for a res a few times.  On at least one occation I had to offer 500pp to get a res.  Compared to the exp loss I will pay it.  I always will buff people for free.  I would not ask a cleric to leave a camp to come res me for free.  If I can avoid it in non guild raids / groups I won't even ask the guild I will get one arranged on site.  I feel it isn't fair to put your friends thru hoops because I made a boo boo.<br>

I am not talking about the rez noodle here, mind you.<br>
I would not take cash for doing two clicks only.<br>
<br>
But if I cross a zone , spend an assload of mana and then have to med 5 minutes to get the mana back I expect more than a warm handshake.<br>
<br>
If you get rezzed, you take, depending on the distance I have to cross, anything from 7-8min to 30min of my time.<br>
Playing time I could spend with friends, mastering a tradeskill, hunting for XP, cash or items.<br>
Additionally, I save you time. But the time saved here goes anywhere from an hour to days or weeks of YOUR time, considering that some people level very slowly or would be unable to reach the place with the corpse without help.<br>

And now tell me, a rez of the 49er or 56er Caliber is not worth some of your cash ?<br>
Sory, but in what kind of world do you live ?? <br>
Why could ANYONE think or EXPECT a stranger to help you just for a thank you ?<br>
<br>
*Takes a deep breath*<br>
And please spare me those Christian teachings outta the bible. They arent how the world works. And I really would prefer not to involve them here .  Of course I know that its exactly what would happen, someone saying its a good and friendly action to help like a samarite.<br>
Sorry bro, I don't believe in your god and my religion has a whole set of different teachings.<br>
So spare me the christian teachings please.<br>
*Releases the air*<br>
<br>
You want me to invest my time to save yours, then invest.<br>
Be it buffs, cash, items or help.<br>

<br>
Why take offense when someone offers pp for a port?  I do it all the time, when I'm /shouting for a port.  I consider it my duty to thank someone for the time they took out for the port.  I never directly ask someone in a tell for a port, it's always a random shout and whomever wishes to respond, does and I always appreciate it.  I show that with the offer to pay for their services.  Sometimes I'm refused, sometimes it's accepted, it's the way of it.<br>
<br>
As far as res's go, I never solicite money.  If it's offered, I sometimes take it, especially if I went out of my way to get to the corpse.  If the corpse comes to me, I rarely refuse to res it.  It's very polite to offer, it's letting someone know they appreciate your time.<br>
<br>
P.S.  My thanks to anyone who accepts a regretful "sorry, no I cannot come right now" with a curtious "thanks for your time".  It goes a long way when it's recognized a cleric can't always drop what they are doing to come to you. <p>Shallondra Bel'la<br>

<br>
If I am sitting in EC, and wanna go hunt, at first I shout that I am looking for a port (no money involved).  If someone offers to give me a ride, I might dump 100pp or so on em.<br>
<br>
If I have to shout that I am paying, and get a reply immediately, I will give em 20, max.<br>
<br>
If I have been shouting for 30 minutes, and eventually get a reply, they might get more (dunno if they just zoned in or are tired of watching me need a port).<br>
<br>
If I shout I am looking for a port (no money), and they ask how much I am paying, I dont even bother replying.<br>
<br>
I am also interested in seeing how the new translocates go over.  While not very cheap mana-wise, they save the wiz a ton of time, not having to zone around.  I dont appreciate having to pay for translocates out of EC, since the wiz is likely just sitting around auctioning anyway.<br>
<br>
As for rezes..<br>
<br>
If I get rezzed by a stranger using an epic, I ask them if they want a donation.  Generally they say no, and I dont really feel like paying, since rezzing me cost them little to no mana (a lot of times they dont even bother healing me post-rez).<br>
<br>
If they rez by their own hand, I donate heavily, without asking..Why?  Ressurection costs 700 mana, and reviviscence costs 600.  The average level 50+ cleric will have about 3000 or so mana.  Including heals, a rez costs a cleric 1-1.5 bubbles of mana.  That is a decent chunk of downtime.  I pay even more if rezzed from a camp (ie I get rezzed at Necrosis by a different group).<br>
<br>
Of course, I never pay for ports or rezes from people I am currently grouped with.  If a pickup group breaks up at the end of the night, and the wiz/druid gives me a port, I wont offer to pay.  The mana they spend is part of what they use in a group.<br>
<br>
Have I ever charged for dragging corpses?<br>
<br>
Nope. <p><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://outside.clanpages.com/ullsig.jpg"><BR><I>Ring Warden</I></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uzuht.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zuht</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Regular Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(5/8/01 10:54:23 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Always pay for TP and ress?</span><hr size=1> A level 56 res and a heal is about 3 times the mana it takes for a group teleport.  Level 49 res is even more...  I find it kind of odd that I have not been offered any compensation the majority of the time since I've been 49.  Even when I am, I usually decline it unless I feel particularly imposed upon, so I'm not complaining about monetary gain.  Rather, I find it odd that it is nigh impossible to get a free teleport from anyone but a guildmate who happens to be in the area.  Hmm, where did all the druids who got free resses vanish to all of a sudden? =P<br>

<br>
A rather disgusting amount of people seem to think that because you are not using mana on the res, it is no inconvenience for them to ask you to wait around while they drag a corpse, or ask you to go to another zone to res them.  (No Ullric, I'm not referring to you, you only brought up a point =)  The people who think like this, of course, never offer any compensation because you know, it didn't cost you any mana and therefor it's no big deal hehehe.  I'm generally kind enough to heal someone after I give them a res (especially since I don't have that added 600 mana cost for the spell).  However, if someone is going to act like an ass to me like the example above, not throwing them a heal is my way of expressing my disapproval of their manners.  That, or I'm just plain OOM =P <p><i>Zuht<br>Templar of <a href="http://www.eqlooking-glass.com">The Looking Glass</a></a><br>
