I don't know about the bug, the GM (other then his name and that he DID help people I know), I don't care about this card nor about the whole discussion and I would like to see PoM once...<br>

I somehow doubt you have that same kind of attitude to your guild's farming of fear, hate, or ToV for your member's class armor that you have for farming PoM for armor... which is quite hypocritical. <br>

<br>
As a guild we do ToV once a week (Wednesdays if you want to avoid a scheduling problem) for armor.  For the time being, since we're not living there 24-7 like some guilds, it's fun, and entertaining.  We also manage about one unscheduled trip a week; which we keep at a minimum to avoid the sort of burnout that can turn what we look forward to as a FUN night in ToV into &quot;the dreaded task of farming armor.&quot;<br>
<br>
So, I stand by my statement.  When it's not fun, I'm going to go somewhere else*.<br>
<br>
[*Obviously, at some point my fun might diminish before it ceases to be fun for EVERYONE in my guild - especially people who are only turning 55 or so now, or who lack a good set of resists whom we ask not to come - and those people, I'll stay a few weeks longer for; and because I enjoy their company.] <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/utheperfectflaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ThePerfectFlaw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/8/01 5:41:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=440.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.theperfectflaw.com/picture/jolly.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Desilous the Corrupt, Lead GM of Ayonae Ro.</span><hr size=1> No offense Palimax, but you can't tell me you've never done something boring because you wanted to improve yourself.<br>
<br>
Camping Ragefire is boring as hell, yet how many cleric epics are there on the server?  Wake up buddy, people do boring stuff all the time.  And that's just one example.<br>
<br>
Do I do it 24/7?  No.  If I was bored everytime I played, I'd have quit a long time ago.  Jesus man, get a glass belly button so you can see out of your ass.<br>
<br>
No doubt seeing PoM for the first time is cool.  I think anyone will agree to that.  The initial run around and see the sights kinda thing.  The first time someone hails Life or trips on a grumpy tree.  Or when there were 90 stomples up.  /shudder.<br>
<br>
I spam invite AFK people to join my group on raids for shits and giggles.  I spam click on them with my debuff stick.  And I spam the trade window now and then.  I find these things to be fun at times.  As a wizard, prepping for a raid is boring shit.  I tack on three buffs on myself, four if I feel the need for ultravision, ask for Clarity 2, Gift of Brilliance and either Heroism or Aegolism depending on how many clerics we got sitting around, and then go do my wash for the rest of the 20 to 30 minute prep time.<br>
<br>
However, if the "go" time is uncertain, then I usually have to pay half ass attention.  In which case, I'll do anything to pass the time.<br>
<br>
Now don't poo-poo me for some newbie criteria bullshit.  "You should pay attention all the time!" blah blah blah blah.<br>
<br>
And as for the quoting game.<br>

Why do you think I still go to ToV?  Why do you think half my guild still goes to ToV?  Why do you think almost -anyone- still goes to ToV that is in full Kael?  To repay those that helped them get full Kael.<br>
<br>
There is -nothing- for me in ToV anymore as far as Kael armor goes.  -Nothing-.  Why do I still attend despite my limiting schedule?  For my guildmates.  It's -boring- as fuck, but I still go.<br>
<br>
Or hell, just a few weeks ago, our guild did the Plane of Sky.  I have nothing to gain from going there.  20 people had nothing to gain from going there.  It's a two-day boring as fuck trip.  Not only that, but it's boring.  It sucks so bad for being boring.  Why would anyone in their right mind go to the plane of sky?<br>
<br>
To get our loyal Magician the crown he needed for his epic.<br>
<br>
It's good to know that you wouldn't have gone to sky if you had thought it's boring.  That's the great kinda attitude that wins your friends over.  "Hey, I'd help, but it's boring, so stfu."<br>

I'm not here whining about the boring, mindless shit I have to do for the greater good of my guild.  I have to do mindless shit all the time.  Heck, I'm a tailor for god's sake...   ...but I'm not here whining about how &quot;awful&quot; it is for me to be in PoM and only able to keep 80% of this week's Blue Throne Cards because the game ate one.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, pitty me because PoM is mired in tedium.&quot;<br>
<br>
The game lost your item because you couldn't stop pounding on your mouse-button.  I ~am~ sorry you lost your item; but people sitting in a zone where you, by your own admission, farm items to give to your friends, and even tell us the item you lost is one of many you got recently, don't garner a lot of sympathy from the great many who will never even SEE the zone, let alone complain that we didn't get every last ounce of treasure we could cary out of it.<br>
<br>
(And, for the record, I enjoyed my last trip to Plane of Sky - as at the time we hadn't been to island-8.  --  and I'm constantly invited back to do corpse recoveries and provide tactical help [especially by necromancers who are trying to complete their epic and need tips on where to leave keys].  Also, I'm not entirely sure why you think we not wanting to do things IN A GAME because I don't enjoy them is such a terrible thing.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/utheperfectflaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ThePerfectFlaw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/8/01 9:21:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=440.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.theperfectflaw.com/picture/jolly.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Desilous the Corrupt, Lead GM of Ayonae Ro.</span><hr size=1> You haven't read a thing we've said have you Pal?<br>

Desilous said the item -had- been traded.  If he had said to me, "The item seems to have dissapeared, sorry, but I can't reiumburse items like that."  I woulda bit my tongue, griped about it to my cat, and gone on.  But he lied to me, to Mogur and to Yasp.<br>
<br>
And did I not just say that PoM is awesome the first time you see it?  It's fun to go explore it for the first few times.  But if you think getting items in PoM is fun, you're mistaken.<br>
<br>
And I've been from isle one to the Eye of Veeshan isle 7 times since sky opened, and that's far more then I care to be there.  It was cool the first time, but now it's not anymore.<br>
<br>

Except it takes 24 people to get those ToV drops, and Mogur solos (I presume, anyway - it's what he says in his posts).  Mogur already told us he looted two more HIMSELF (remember, these are very contested spawns) since the incident.<br>

I think you miss the point entierly.<br>
These guys did not post this because they lost the card or because the GM didn't reimburse it. They posted it because the GM found it easier to just make up some bullshit instead of either investigate or admit he didn't know.<br>
<br>
I too find this unsetteling.<br>
If a guide pull some bullshit, fine.<br>
He's just a fellow player trying to help.<br>
A GM however, is a employee and Customer Service Representive of a corporation where I am customer. And as a customer, I do not like companies to treat me or other customers like that.<br>
<br>
Same with my character name. It's no big deal that my necro's name isn't spelled exactly as I want. I wouldn't have leveled her all that high anyway. The way the GM handeled the case is much more serious then the case itself.<br>
<br>
I have worked on customer service myself. Sure enough, customers can be annoying at times. But you DO NOT make up bullshit answers when you don't know, and then pull on your authority to demand belief and respect. You just don't.<br>
<br>
I hope for the servers sake that this GM either is inexperienced and will learn over time, or will be replaced. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

<br>
I understand they feel that the server GM &quot;lied&quot; to them.<br>
<br>
I disagree.<br>
<br>
He might have been mistaken; he might have been misinformed; he might even be slightly developmentally disabled, but I don't get the impression from the conversations that he _purposefully lied_ to them.<br>
<br>
Even from reading the cut-and-paste screenshotted logs, I get the impression that the GM is confused about exactly WHAT card you guys are talking about -- as there's a couple in the story.  Nearly everything makes sense if he goes through the log, finds _A_ throne card, adds it to the tells he gets (which were all undoubtedly crystal clear as to what card, what day), and then tells what what it APPEARS happened to him.<br>
<br>
Understand that his job is to provide support for THOUSANDS of people, and if his support queue looks anything like mine, he has nothing but the stickiest of issues to deal with -- the ones that nobody else could manage a successful resolution on (I do call escalation and infrastructure support - I suspect our jobs are similar in that respect).  He went out of his way to review logs for an event that happened in a CS-restricted zone, and probably gave you the best resolution he could possibly do based on the information he was given and the time to manage your case along with all the other ones he has to deal with on a daily basis.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
...and yes, I did go off on them for complaining how miserable PoM was.  I mean, cripes, they're part of a small circle of farmers sitting in the most exclusive zone in the game (Sleeper's not withstanding) soloing mobs for &quot;priceless&quot; treasure and the best possible thing they have to do is complain about it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, PoM is so boring and tedius and our GM screwed us.&quot;<br>
<br>
If they're singing another tune, I'd be happy to hear it.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
I wish the GM had been able to replace their item, but I'm still looking for an answer to this one to clear the whole thing up:<br>
<br>
To Zehn: You believe (since nobody can seem to substantiate it) that the card exists, and is currently in the inventory of who?<br>
<br>
If someone has the card, why don't they just give it to you?<br>

I have some knowledge of fixing technical issues mostly because I also act as the last filter to keep badly written solutions that won't actually do anything from appear on our external web. I first got into the industry doing gameplay assistance support for a different company and have worked as a paid game tester in the past. One thing that I think people should keep in mind is this:<br>
<br>
No game is 100% bug free.<br>
<br>
Every game on a store shelf has at some minor bugs in it. Usually it is something very minor like something is the wrong color or bad graphic popup. In some cases, games will have very rare bugs that will impact functionality, cause you to loose item, make the game crash or do something that will force you to start over completely. In a massive game like EverQuest, with thousands of players - these type of bugs become way more common than they would if this was a one-player game.<br>
<br>
<br>
More than likely, you tried to trade the item to one person, the game glitched [most likely cause by the excessive clicking] and thought that you traded the item to someone you didn't give it to.<br>
<br>
<br>
I doubt this is a case of an evil server GM out to get players. Though I will point out that a lot of companies have policies against admitting that any paticular bug is real, and one of my past employers had a policy of firing support staff if they said the dreaded B word. It's not the support staff's fault if you played a game and encountered a bug. Sometimes they can help you and sometimes they cannot. It depends on the policies that are set in place by the company, and how much leway they are given to break said policies.<br>
<br>
<br>
About the only lying I can see going on here is that he GM is not suggesting that you probably encountered a bug and trying to cover up the bug. He could be doing it to keep his job.<br>
