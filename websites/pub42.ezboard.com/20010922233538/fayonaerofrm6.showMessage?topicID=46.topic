This happened recently to a friend of mine.<br>
<br>
He had a spare computer at work, and was camping a spawn in velious that he was unsure whether it was timed or triggered or what. Kinda like the minotaur hero was before someone finally spilled the beans on how to spawn him. So he's camping where he's heard it spawns, kinda semi afk, looking at the monitor every so often to see if it spawned or not, and if nobody else was there, kill it, otherwise, just figure out the timing, how it spawned, etc....<br>
<br>
He gets a tell &quot;why are you here?&quot; &quot;camping the xxxx&quot;<br>
<br>
The next interaction he gets is from a gm. It seems he's been petitioned by someone for hanging around the area. Note, NO TELLS HAVE BEEN EXCHANGED, no attempt at diplomacy, no exchange of information, no nothing.<br>
<br>
So the gm questions my friend and gets the full info on why he's there, talks to the petitioner, who doesn't seem satisfied with my friend sitting there. I'm guessing the petitioner was rude as all hell, cause the gm finally just tells them to roll. My friend wins. The petitioner starts going off in ooc about how he's been here for an entire day camping for this thing and how my friend lied to the gm about how long my friend had camped there and forced the roll. Comments like /who all loser in ooc...etc. Basically claiming that my friend came to the camp and pnped it. He then also just sits by my friend, NOW claiming that it ISN'T a camp and that whoever aggroes the thing first gets it. The gm summons him to neriak and binds him there.<br>
<br>
The petitioner gets a ride from a guildmate back and brings another friend in, and these people continue the /ooc annoyances. Now this is the part where I start caring, cause the guildmate then asks my friend &quot;is everyone in your guild as greedy as you?&quot;<br>
<br>
My friend tells the petitioner that he's only here to grab the spawn if nobody else was here, and for the petitioner to go ahead and take it if it spawns. The petitioner then tells him that the gm told him to not take the first one that spawns on pain of possible account suspension.<br>
<br>
THE ENTIRE FACKING INCIDENT WAS CAUSED BY THE INCOMPETANCE OF THE PETITIONER IN THE FIRST PLACE BY NOT BOTHERING TO SEND TELLS AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HELL WAS GOING ON IN THE FIRST PLACE.<br>
<br>
If you are going to call in the gms on a camp dispute, it is extremely lame to then not abide by the decision of the gm.  It is even lamer to claim that something is a camp when petitioning the gm, and then claiming it isn't a camp after the gm makes a ruling against you based on the thing being a camp.<br>
<br>
So this is my response to &quot;is everyone in your guild as greedy as you&quot;.  Sigh.  At least make an attempt to talk to us in Red Branch when there is a possible dispute. We are hard asses, we're not going to do your work for you, but YOU CAN TALK TO US AND WE LISTEN. We're not going to just roll over and leave when we're some place, but it tends to pay off to bother to figure out what the situation is rather than to just make assumptions.  If you don't even make the attempt at diplomacy, well, we've been around the block a few times on that front, too, both in gm interaction and people attempting to ks us. Frankly, people who work with us tend to have more fun than people who try to dick with us.<br>
<br>
I'm hoping this sort of behaviour is not indicative of (guildname deleted*) in general.  I'm guessing this was just an isolated incident.<br>
<br>
We'll see.  If anyone is (guildname deleted*) wants full details of the incident, please give me a tell in game.<br>
<br>
*edit-- looks like the poeple involved are posting, so...taking the guilds who aren't mine out of it. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/umaniacles.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maniacles</A> at: 1/16/01 10:39:32 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ugaeian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gaeian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/14/01 5:10:51 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/yangkarana/v-burn.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Calling the playground monitor.</span><hr size=1> Hmmm were you there?  Yah didnt think so.  First off the /who all loser comment was not made by "the petitioner"(TM)  nor the other CN member there, it was made by me, and in say, not ooc.  In fact cant remember seeing any oocs at all about the situation.  The exchange went closer to:<br>
     someone says "this loser is trying to take the camp"<br>
     Sladen says "/who all loser"<br>
 I was there much of the day, first with my druid looking for Midnight, then I logged on the monk and was killing cougars for experience.  I do rememeber "the petitioner"(TM) being pretty much all day, saw him while I was on the druid but other than a small group near the spawnpoint, i didnt see anyone else there.  Same while I was on the monk.  So please if you are going to talk out your ass at least clean it so what you say doesnt stink like shit.  Yah the situation got blown up, everyone has a bad day especially when someone moves in on a camp you have been sitting at for a long time.  I'm not saying your guildmate hasnt been there a while too, I remember him asking me to track for Stormfeather 2 days ago.  The facts still remain, yah "the petitioner"(TM) was there all day camping Stormfeather; Yah your guildmate moved in to the camp, and upon seeing it "the petitioner"(TM) called a guide in to settle it, now as to what transpired between the GM and he is between them, and I didnt see the random or some of the things coming after it as I was busy killing cougars and wasnt paying the situation much attention.  BTW your timing is all off, the "/who all loser" wasnt until much later.  Truthfully if I had been there all day, someone moved in and a Guide told me that i had to random on if i got to kill it I'd have been banned cause I would have told the Guide to take his keyboard, turn it sideways and to stick it up his bloody arse.  But then thats just me and its been a bad day.  As for "the guildmate"(TM), first off that person really has no bearing on the situation at hand other than the port back.  Secondly while the comment was a bit hot headed,  you must remember just as you came here to stand up for your guildmate, "the guildmate"(TM) came into the situation having to leave a camp to port a guildmate and help him because a camp he had been in all day was being taken from him.  You can be sure that "the petitioner"(TM) as well as "the guildmate"(TM) were rather upset and as such said things to the effect.  In the end it seems your guildmate knew he was in the wrong and said for "the petitioner"(TM) to take the next spawn.<br>
<br>
Now looking at your other post which actually lists all your rants, I will take it you are a practiced ranter, so I will end my rant here.  Like a wise monk once told me, " Never argue with an idiot, they will bring you down to their level and then beat you with experience." <br>
<br>
And for the record, no I'm not a member of CN, but yes "the guildmate"(TM) has been like a sister to me since back on Cazic.  I dont really know "the petitioner" other than grouping with him once at the bats in SolB while both of us were on our monks.  I will take this time to thank some of the CN members who, even though they didnt know who I was, allowed me to loot a spell I had been wanting since Velious came out from their PoG raid.  Not sure if i got all the names right but the members were Behemoth, Scy, Bamdar, Tuloc, Rellikcam, and Kev. Also grats to Nomi who did finish the quest for the mask a few days ago.  As for the members of CN, despite the bad rumors, the members I have met have been good people.<br>

&quot;Is all your guild as greedy as you&quot; hmm i thought i had asked if they were as selfish, could be my error. I was in a hunt in POG when i see over guild chat that some rogue has basically taken the camp off a member and because he was upsset about it he said some not so nice things and won a free port to neriak from a GM and needed a port back. <br>
<br>
I decided to also  go and join the camp after all there was already no respect shown for a camp set up? If your guild member did not want the camp then why did he roll for it HMMMMMMMMMMMMM! He could have just said &quot;well yah know im really unhappy you were called here since i really have no interest in doing this camp at the present time i would just like to get a time on the spawn&quot; <br>
<br>
And please do you think anyone is going to consider this a life shattering event that you needed to post it on here? I will go and help any guild member who needs my help, especially if its over a camp they had already been at 15+ hours. Next time you decide to post though could you -please aim to get the facts correct <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><div align="center"><center>

I usually dont have problems with CN members antics for the most part, but you gotta be one of the biggest hypocrites of all time to be asking someone else that selfish crap.<br>
<br>
You can paint the nice little pretty picture of CN being the guild that works with others and is good for this NEW server, but I havent forgot the screwed up things your guild has said and done in the past to the people of Cazic Thule. Perhaps you yourself didnt say them Moonraider, but by wearing the tag, you certainly dont have a problem with the deeds.<br>
<br>
A fresh start on a new server didnt erase memories. Its not a lifeshattering event like you stated, its just the usual for you, isnt it?<br>
<br>
Im still in shock that a member of CN tried to use reputation as a weapon to cull someone into leaving a camp. Simply amazing.

This had nothing to do with reputation chasing someone from a camp, this had to do with someone disrespecting a camp. If i came in and wanted your camp, you wouldnt be upset about it?

When it comes to CN, it seems they have many enemies. But anecdotes don't interest me. I try to base my opinions about guilds on peoples firsthand experiences made on this server. I.E. I listen to &quot;I saw&quot;, not to &quot;I heard&quot;. My only own experience is that I was on a Trak Raid with EW when CN zoned in in huge numbers to take trak. However, they saw that we was allready there, so they left after a few minutes and we carried on with our raid without any problem of any kind. Regardless, individuals should be junged as indiniduals primarily, guildtag comes second. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ufurtivus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Furtivus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/15/01 7:10:47 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Calling the playground monitor.</span><hr size=1> Edeina I was passing no judgment as to whether Yuegou's assertion of CN was or was not factually correct.

<br>
You didnt come from Cazic to know what Furtivus is referring to. Example: CN decided they wanted to kill the Maestro in Hate, so they showed up after another group had cleared up to 2 spawns away from the Maestro, and then sat down in front of the area and effectively stopped the other guild from thier first ever kill on the Maestro. When the other group tried to pull what they had worked so hard to get to, CN claimed they were training them, which the other guild technically was (but its kinda hard not to train someone sitting in your pull path on purpose!). CN killed the Maestro, ruined the other guilds first chance at a guild kill on the Maestro, and then struted around about it on the message boards.<br>
<br>
This is the usual crap for CN, and just because you havent seen it yet or been a victim of it yet, doesnt mean it doesnt/didnt happen. The people from CT have seen it and felt it, and CN had stated many times in the past, they dont give a crap about anyone other than themselves. That I dont have a problem with, at least they say it instead of playing some song and dance around it. But now Moonraider is doing just that! Posting here acting like CN plays nice with everyone and someone wont play nice back. Thats the hypocrasy people are talking about. You cant have your cake and eat it too.<br>
<br>
I dont understand this, dont label me because of my guild tag crap people preech about. I notice people get all gleeful when thier guild does something in house. They brag, they strut, they wave it in others faces. But they sure as hell dont want anyone pointing at the guild as a collective when it comes to the bad PR. Notice alot of people post here with guild tags... why? If the person is not judged by thier guild tag, whats the point of waving it around outside the game? If your guild kill steals over and over, you leave, or you stay. Leaving shows you dont want to be known as a kill stealer, staying shows you condone it as long as it fulfills your needs. Kill stealing once is eventually overlooked, but repeating the process over and over tends to etch itself in peoples minds for a very long time. Alot of CT minds are etched. People might not say straight out to CN, get the hell away from me, but they sure are ready for when the rattlesnake will strike.<br>

<b>Morchaint</b>, I stood up for Kat here because she made a site at her expense. Does she play on AR? Why should she give a shit about putting up a board for them? Out of friendship and because she wanted to help out. She built ARC to show the people that left Cazic her thanks for making CTC what it is. Why did I slam her (you words. Imo I slammed censorship, not her) for trying to inact a play nice policy on CTC? Because I dont like censorship of any form! Now please explain how censorship and her self-sacrifice have anything in common in order to make me a hypocrite. I sure hope you arent posting what you did out of spite, simply because Kat tried to enact the PNP over someone slamming pics of CN. I stated in that thread numerous times that I didnt see the offending material, nor were any of my posts related to that. If you are surprised that someone attacked CN that way, you must be too stupid to be playing EQ, because after all the crap they have pulled, Im not surprised it hasnt happened sooner since there are no repercussions for them in EQ. Post because you hate me, not on the grounds of some half baked comparison, I will have more respect for you that way.<br>

Thats how CN responds to anything when they step on other players. Go do a search on CTC and you will see the same reply to the posts when CN has wronged someone. They simply thumb thier nose at others and chant, nyah nyah. AR will learn, it took the people of CT a while to come to realization. CN might be playing nice right now, but they will get tired of the pace the rest of the server moves at and will begin stepping on toes again.<br>

I do, however, feel the pain of all those involved and my sympathies go out to everyone.  Thank you for bringing a tear to my eye during this long boring day of work.<br>

Yes if you go and check the threads of the smartass comments usually replied from CN members to all the flame posts im sure it will appear as if we dont give a rats ass, but its really more to the point it doesnt matter what we say to explain things or whatnot the ppl will flame anyway so why not at least throw in some amusing posts to the flames?<br>

<br>
&quot;Yah the situation got blown up, everyone has a bad day ESPECIALLY WHEN SOMEONE MOVES IN ON A CAMP YOU HAVE BEEN SITTING AT FOR A LONG TIME.&quot; (emphasis mine)<br>
<br>
The only reason that this was the perception was that no tells were exchanged.  He was watching the camp.  If it was empty when the mob spawned, he was planing on taking it.  If someone was there, he was just going to get the timing on the spawn.<br>
<br>
That is the information that, had some tells been exchanged, could have been found out and the whole thing never happened.<br>
<br>
What he was doing never changed.  There was no &quot;giving back the camp cause he was in the wrong&quot;.  There was merely the futher exchange of information. <br>
Why did he roll? The gm said roll.  <br>
Why was the gm there? The other guy called in the gm.<br>
<br>
Was I there? I was just looking at the screen at where my friend works and was reading the backscroll text.  Figure that for accuracy as you will.<br>
<br>
Frankly, the two people involved patched things together and all is cool with the world as far as they are concerned.<br>
<br>
But, as is wont to happen when people don't bother reading the entirety of my rants, my point seems to have gotten lost.<br>
<br>
So here are a few of the points I made.  In small words where possible:<br>
------------------<br>
Send tells and figure out what is going on before calling a gm.<br>
<br>
A gm is last resort.<br>
<br>
If you do call a gm, abide by the gm ruling.  Failing to do so is LAME.<br>
<br>
Gm rulings are capricious, and should be avoided at all costs.<br>
<br>
Failing to comunicate is the single biggest problem a guild, and an individual, can have.<br>
------------------<br>
On to details:<br>
<br>
Now, you know what?  Gaeian, yer right about the commentary being in say.  I stand corrected.  Always good to get the correct info out there.<br>
<br>
And Moonraider, here's the deal.  It was entirely in your friends head that there was a problem.  My first point is that once he called in a gm, it's lame to immediately go against the ruling of that gm, however lame the ruling is.  My second point is that even calling in the gm was lame, based on one tell.  As a matter of fact, what you wrote is exactly what he told the gm, but for some reason the gm insisted that he roll anyway.  My guess is because yer buddy couldn't handle mine hanging around, because, once again, no tells were exchanged.<br>
<br>
When you say, &quot;hey, he's been here for 16 hours.&quot;  That's the sort of information that should be exchanged BEFORE calling in the gm.  No, it wasn't inherantly obvious.  And even if it was, bringing in the random result generator (the gm) should be a last resort, not the first thing done.<br>
<br>
As to this being a life shattering incident?<br>
Blah.  When I write shit up it's to illustrate types of behaviour and comment on them.  Been doing that for years.<br>
Actually, I found it to be an amusing anecdote of someone calling in a gm and getting screwed by his own petition, purely based on failing to comunicate. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/umaniacles.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maniacles</A> at: 1/16/01 10:44:24 am<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=46.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=46.topic&start=41&stop=49>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessage?topicID=60.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessage?topicID=41.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=46.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.threadControl?topicID=46.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=46.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=46.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying<option value="ayonaerofrm11">Fight the Plague!<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Diplomacy Corner<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Administration Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6>NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
