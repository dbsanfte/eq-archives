No.  Kinuvan held agro most of the fight and his cleric ended the fight with more than half mana.  Taygon and Allamar had bad luck with resists despite good gear and Kinu's song.  Bottom line, once I asked Kinu to come, it was fairly clear he was going to steal agro and start tankin'.<br>

I don't get a rats ass if kinu tanked it and the guy you &quot;didn't need&quot; just added a bit of melee damage.<br>

Are you gonna say you *let* Kinu help you too? If not, where do you draw the line for being &quot;a help&quot;? 5k damage? 10? 32?<br>
<br>
I'm telling you this(repeatedly because you get all defensive believing i am arguing your loot):<br>
<br>
If *I* helped your guild kill something -for fun, profit, friendship, money..whatever reason- and then find out i wasn't &quot;needed&quot; and you didn't &quot;owe&quot; me anything, you'd never get help from me again.<br>
<br>
I'm not to sure why you keep wanting to argue loot, when i keep saying the above.<br>
<br>
Logix, I fail to see the logic in that example because *there is no logic in that example*<br>
<br>
Roll if you will use. If you have better(even 1% better), you don't NEED that item. You could argue it all you want, both in my guild and any guild i've raided with, but you wouldn't get to roll on it. <br>
<br>
Arguing it would probably get you booted from the raid/future raids.<br>
<br>
Guild raid, not a pickup group.<br>
<br>
And yes Logix, because you need the reassurance of my status, I *DO* have a high level character in a respected guild.<br>

Ironically enough, when ranger loot drops for Vision - the rangers in Vision tend to be in unanimous agreement as to which of us gets the loot. We don't random for loot. There really is no need to either when a ranger in Vision can say he wants somethin and have every other ranger say I want him to have that.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Half the damn problem is the way some guilds loot. Here is an example I saw, Vision XA and possible a few other, recently killed VS. Tolans legs and Elderspiritist legs dropped. So all the rangers rolled on the Tolans legs. The winner was then told by his guild that he may Not keep them and they are guild property and may go to some ranger that wasn't on and doesn't play alot(from my view). This is bullshit, the ranger kept the legs, since no one else needed. But it's retared that someone who goes to the raid and can REALLY use the the gear doesnt get it.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I am a ranger in the guild Vision and do not know of the raid you speak of. I will also add that I do not know of a single pair of Tolan's Darkwood Legs being worn by a ranger in Vision that was not purchased by that ranger. So if this mystery ranger was a memeber of Vision who you seem to enjoy attacking, your information is off.<br>
<br>
There was a Trakanon raid that was a team up between Vision and Exilied Alliance [XA] where a Tolan's Darkwood Breastplate and an Elderspirit's Breastplate dropped. Vision got the Tolan's BP and XA got the Elderspirit's. The only reason a &quot;loot disagreement&quot; occured over that Tolan's BP was because there were only two rangers in Vision at the time that would benefit from wearing the Tolan's full time, both were present at the raid and both tried to pass it to the other ranger.<br>
<br>
I guess that not agreeing on loot because you care so much about the others of your class just proves how greedy Vision rangers really are, and that Vision as a guild endorses such vile behaviour by continuing to award us more loot - thus proving that Vision is an evil guild and the true vilians of the server. If this is the case, so be it. The bad guys are usually more interesting anyway. *grin*<br>

He is soloable by a level 60 paladin.  EW has a full group there.  Even if i do damage, and &quot;help them,&quot;  I was NOT needed.  Because i &quot;helped&quot; them, should i ask to be allowed to roll against their paladin for the testimoney?<br>

This is a hypothetical situation, made up to show you how dense you are in this piticular thread.

The dragon was up for quite a while since they had time to finish up in fear, then move on to check the spawn, mobilize, and take him down. So it isn't like they would have missed the chance if the guy didn't send a tell.<br>
<br>
There were enough vision members to kill the dragon. They couldda told the guy he wasn't allowed to join em for the kill. They didn't NEED him, but they allowed him to join and roll on the scale AT HIS REQUEST. Stop ranting about the fact they did something nice. <br>
<br>
A week or two ago I was in a group with some vision members. They said they had to bail to hit fear. I ASKED to come along and was allowed. Was I needed? nope. They let me come along to have a fun evening. If the &quot;uber chanter item of doom(tm)&quot; had dropped, would I have stomped and demanded a roll? Nope. I ASKED to come. Vision has chanters out the ying-yang. They ALLOWED me to come as a favor. They didn't NEED me.<br>
<br>
This make sense to you yet?<br>
<br>
What they did in EJ is admirable. Many guilds wouldn't let a non guild warrior roll on a major epic bottleneck piece.<br>

<br>
Listen and learn you ignorant #@*!'s<br>
<br>
There seems to be two systems people use to distribute loot in EQ. <br>
<br>
Randoming items so its &quot;fair&quot; reguardless of participation within the guild or need of item.  Well there are additional problems with this system.  Example, when a level 50 character wins a high level BP who rarely participates in guild raids especially when no loot drops for his class.  So by winning this nice item the guild will rarely benefit from it.  <br>
<br>
Using a loot council system or have loot system which does not use /rand.  This system has advantages depending how its laid out.<br>
<br>
In Vision, we use Class Leaders and Officers primarily to determine who gets what loot.  For the Shadow Knight class for example its primarily based on:<br>
1)Guild Participation (Raids and Events)<br>
2)Shadow Knight Level<br>
3)Need<br>
<br>
Now by having this laid out in the beginning so everyone knows you do two things which are extremely helpful in a guild.  You encourage more participation in Guild Raids and encourage people to work on leveling so they can improve their value to the Guild.  <br>
<br>
I am a firm believer that this system is much better in a guild system because it encourages teamwork and guild values instead of merely relying on randomness which in my opinion just encourages greed.  It does depend on people however every officer in Vision tries to be as fair as possible some to the extent of passing on loot they want just because they would feel bad taking the item.  <br>
<br>
SOME of the Officers / Class Leaders have had to be FORCED to take loot when they originally declined thinking others would benefit more.  That kinda attitude is truely what Vision is all about helping each other to get better and having fun at the same time.<br>
<br>
I challenge you all on this question you /rand NUTZ.<br>
<br>
You go on a raid to trak and a Shadow Knight BP drops there are no Shadow Knights on the raid... So now what do you do????<br>
<br>
Also answer how your /rand considers need, guild participation and how higher levels would benefit the guild more from the loot.<br>

I'm curious. How come 90% of the message board chooses to associate their in-game identities with their message-board identities, but not you Crist0?<br>
<br>
For most of us, you can see our guildname and charactername at the bottom of each post. With you and a few others, we have to be assured that &quot;Yes I really play the game&quot; and &quot;Yes I'm in a great guild and I participate in the community outside this forum&quot;.<br>

<br>
Kinuvan was probably the most helpful person at the raid.  Of any single player there he probably had the higest attack, AC, and resistances and probably more HP than Allamar and Taygon.  Depending on output from our Sorceror and Assassin in attendance, he probably even did the most damage.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what your point is, however.  I'm confident that we could have killed Servelous alone.  Without the warrior, without Kinuvan.  We had already killed Gorenaire and Talendor in the last 6 or 8 hours with similar forces.  Our force for Serv was smaller, but it included our some of our best and brightest.  ...and even if we had failed, nobody was waiting in the wings to stop us from trying again, and again, and again if necessary.  Nobody was killing Serv except us.<br>
<br>
What answer are you fishing for?  I'd like you to find me ONE WARRIOR who wants his epic who wouldn't take the sort of deal that we struck with the warrior who sent us a tell.<br>
<br>
11% on a Green Dragonscale is better odds than most warriors on this server will *ever* see.<br>
<br>
What I'm telling you, over, and over, and over, and over again, is that not only did we give the warrior WHAT HE ASKED FOR, we gave him a fair shake, and more than most guilds would give him.<br>
<br>
You also haven't answered my question.  I need to know what your guild is, so next time I see Velkator up, I can send your guildleader a tell and then I can help for a &quot;fair chance&quot; at a Bone Ring of Condemnation.<br>
<br>
I've also decided that I'd like to help you on Vulak.  I need a fair shot at his robe too.  When I spot him up can I send you a tell?<br>
<br>
Oh, and I'd like a fair shot at Cazic Thule's brain as well.  When he's up, I'll send you a tell.  I'm positive that in return for me spotting him and helping that I'll get a fair chance at it.<br>
<br>
After all, you'd be a total jerk not to give me a fair chance at it, right? <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4868>Palimax Sceleris</a>,

<br>
Why do these non-Vision people who don't even post under their character names even care Vision loot policies? The facts remain:<br>
<br>
1. Members of Vision don't have issues with Vision loot policies.<br>
2. Other guilds that we've teamed up to raid with don't have issues with Vision loot policies.<br>
3. Non-members who have raided with Vision as a guest don't have issues with Vision loot policies.<br>
<br>
<br>
Perhaps some people just feel a need to fight the evil power that is Vision, even when the method by which they promote their cause makes no sense.<br>

...is in dispute, in that several of our members are, instead of working with their guild-mates, class-leaders, and officers to make a better system, are instead shopping secretly for new guilds under cover of darkness.<br>
<br>
This, again, however, is NOT news.  I am (and every other guildleader) is perpetually bogged down in tells from people from other guilds looking for a new home.<br>
<br>
I'm confident that the vast majority of Vision is happy; and I offer that the &quot;proof is in the pudding&quot; when you look at our member roster and the length of people's tenure.<br>

<br>
Just about level 55.<br>
<br>
Sorry, not high level till i get to 60?<br>
<br>
Damn, just ruined my day. No - really. <br>
<br>
I think my penis just shrunk an inch as well, as you all know there is a direct correlation between penis size and level.<br>
<br>
Incidently if the raids i went on used vision's system of loot, i would be at the top of the list for &quot;new cool warrior usable item&quot;. <br>
<br>
I like random better. But my posts don't have jack shit to do with loot or loot rules. <br>
<br>
To be honest greed and worrying as much as some of you do about loot/loot rules really ruins the game for you. <br>
<br>
Dammur, how about if you helped EW's twink pally, then they proceeded to &quot;show how good they are&quot; by letting you know they didn't need you and didn't owe you anything for the time?<br>
<br>
Did they need you? No. <br>
<br>
Do you know that? Yeah.<br>
<br>
Is it pretty rude if they do a &quot;/tell Dammur You DO know we didn't need you and we don't owe you anything, we're just nice enough to let you help us&quot;? <br>
<br>
Hell Yeah.<br>
<br>
But i doubt they'd say that.<br>
<br>
I know I was one of the thousand or so &quot;helping&quot; EW in their 10th ring wars. They didn't come here afterwards and post that they didn't need me(or anyone else out there), or send a tell saying the same. In fact I was having a nice conversation with a cleric of theirs during the setup. Most would consider this guy  &quot;born cranky&quot; or even  &quot;an ass&quot; (maybe even moreso than LL), but he never thought to remind me that his guild didn't need me there or owe me anything for helping.<br>
<br>
And that's pretty much what i read out of Pali's first post and most vision posts since - and then they claim they're angelic for doing so.<br>
<br>
I don't buy it.<br>
<br>
As for you Shorty, I did Dragon raids with FD before you were a) in that guild or b) of level to even think of doing so. That'd be YOUR notice of stfu if you don't know what you are talking about.<br>
<br>
Good Day, Holier than Thou Cleric Sir(And save the no rez threat for someone who cares,  i know its bouncin around in your head now).<br>
<br>
<br>
Blearchie, i agree that it was cool of them to let him fight and roll. What I call them on is how they belittle him in almost every post here, in the name of proving how good and nice they are.<br>
<br>
And I say if i was that guy, and got belittled, i wouldn't be tempted to help em out from there on. You might not need him for that dragon, but there will probably come a day where he can help you a good deal. <br>
<br>
/oops<br>
<br>
I bet they didn't tell you they didn't need you there or owe you anything while you were in fear, just to remind you that you were there out of the kindness of their hearts.<br>
<br>
Here's a lil story:<br>
Up in hate, with IM(i guess you could say i'm a respected warrior to them, they did let me come along), we kill the hand. I KNOW for a fact that they had warriors up there that this piece WAS a bottleneck for(I even know one of them had a green scale already, and am sure she needed this). <br>
<br>
Guess what? They let me roll for it. Know what else? When i thanked them for allowing me on the raid at the end of the night, I got many &quot;Glad you could make it&quot; tells, shouts, etc.<br>
<br>
THAT's class. And something you can look at and say &quot;Yep, that's a nice guild&quot;.<br>
<br>
Anything less would be uncivilized, so to speak.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, I ended up with the hand, and they were still as nice as all that. I even tried passing when I won, they wouldn't hear of it. <br>
<br>
Class.<br>
<br>
Are there guilds who wouldn't have let me go up, or wouldn't have let that warrior help kill the dragon?<br>
<br>
You betcha, and I wouldn't piss on them to save them from being burned alive.<br>
<br>
Ps. OH HEY Pali(i'm kicking myself for saying this but i can't drop the fact..sorry guildies ( kill me later ) CORRECT me where I'm wrong but DIDN'T you ask a few of my guildmates for help with Velk. You know, since you brought it up and all.<br>

Then to any female members of the guild.<br>
