Ytrok: /agree (as usual, we got used of that a long time ago <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
Maniacles: Thats also a very good point. What really many people simply forget is that time did NOT start at 0 AD.<br>
Just because christians started to count time as Jesus (whoever that was)  was born (whoever could proove that), doesn't mean that time did start then.<br>
<br>
- Libraries of Alexandria. Hundrets of thousands of books with a HUGE knowledge, probably many many things we don't even know at all have been in those libraries.<br>
- Egypt. They have wrote thousands, even millions of books or similar things on Papyrus and in stone.<br>
- Hebräes (sp?). The invented written language a whole lot of time before the &quot;euros&quot;. <br>
- Roman Culture. Latin. Way before the birth of Jesus.<br>
- Greec Culture. Dito<br>
- Aztec Culture. Prolly thousands of years before Jesus was born.<br>
- The whole asian civilisation. Noone can doubt that fact that Chinese and Japanese Civilization way WAY ahead of us Euros (yes, US people are also euros...). They wrote books LONG LONG time before Euros even thought about using written language. <br>
<br>
Those are just a few high cultures which sure are WAY older than any christians even can think of since they simply start everything like 2000 Years ago. Pre Jesus there were some things... But all there really was are things like Noah, the Tower of Babel and such. Just stuff to teach the people to not do anything bad...<br>
<br>
&lt;---- And then you tell me that the Bible is the oldest book?<br>
Just because &quot;we Euros&quot; have destroyed everything else, doesn't mean it didn't exist! The Bible is in no way the oldest book. Just that millions of people tried hard to destroy everything else - in the name of god - to make sure just the bible (and the christian religion) survives. <br>
<br>
And what Nena says is a VERY important point.<br>
The Bible is not even very old actually. The Bibile was (maybe) written in hebräeic language. It then has been translated somewhen, by someone, who knows how good that person spoke hebräeic or latin. The first person that translated the Bible from Latin to french/english/german as like at 1600AD (more or less). You hardly can translate Latin to any of those languages without a huge loss of information. Words that have not been known have been invented, whole pages have been left out, whatever.<br>
Besides this... As Nena said, the Bible always has been editted the way it just pleased the Pope (and his men) the best.<br>
<br>
Things like the 6th and 7th Book Moses are not part of the Bible, they are illegal. They even are illegal in LAW, not just religion. What crap is that? Its part of the original Bible. but in those books Moses describes Black Magic. How you can hurt people with Magic and such stuff. OF COURSE the Church did not allow such things. Especially if they kill hundret of thousands of people because they are witches!<br>
Yes. The original Bible gives exact instructions how to hold black riuals and how to use Satans Power for your own strength. <br>
<br>
The bible clearly describes - even also now in the EDIT Version 4845.5 - things like the landing of UFOs, it describes rape of women by &quot;holy men&quot; - it clearly states that women are worth nothing. Why do you think NO Daughter of someone is listed in that huge lists of children? Who cares daughters!?<br>
<br>
THe Bible is packed full of contradictions. Exactly with the Bible you can tell the church that they are wrong. Even with the editted version. But the church knows to ignore the &quot;bad parts&quot;, knows how to interprete stuff really wrong and give really bad answers.<br>
<br>
The Bible is neither holy nor in any way a book of religion or &quot;the good&quot; or &quot;how to do it&quot;.<br>
The Bible is nothing else than a 100times editted book with many stories from the back. Great stories, interesting reports, tells you MUCH about how people lived at that times and how they acted and how they thought. But thats it.<br>
Its a wild mixture out of pure fiction, report, personal ideas and free translations, and many parts that are not there.<br>
<br>
The Bible sure is a good book. Its interesting.<br>
But I bet the original Version had nothing to do with THE GOD we know. It were just what I mentioned above.<br>
But the vaqlues and the ideas the bible tries to make you believe in are stupid. Especially since the church just picks things that suit them well. The parts that are not that nice, they either interprete completely screwed up, or mostly ignore.<br>
<br>
Did you know that in the middle age you could murder someone, then go to chruch, PAY a few silver coins and your sins have been officially forgiven? <br>
They had like a card or so where you could see how much a certain sin costs. Seriously, this was completely normal. <br>
Talk about god being corrupt! Haha.<br>
Well, its true and it was told by the church that this is ok and that good thinks its good like that.<br>
<br>
I have never ending arguments, really hundrests of them, why the christian religion (and some others, but I know the christian the way best) is nothing than pure cheating people, greedy bastards and in fact the most cruel murderers that killed more persons than ANYTHING else EVER and brought more pain than ANYTHING else EVER.<br>
<br>
But people that believe in it of course wouldn't listen to me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
They always and in every way just deny, say no, close their eyes and then shake head and say &quot;ahhh he doesn't know what he says, please forgive him god.&quot;<br>

<br>
I believe in the big bang because it makes sense because of the red change in the spectrum of the stellar objects, which proves that everything is moving apart because of the Doppler effect. So if everything has a red shift it HAS to mean that all objects in the universe are moving apart and proves that something in the creation of the universe exploded or set an outwards force when it was created and the big bang is probably a good idea to what created the universe, but the question is? What created it all in the first place? Another universe and contracted upon itself? If so then what created that? Another big bang? So the answer to the creation is probably way to complex for anyone's mind to fully grasp or understand, for now what would make the most sense would be &quot;god&quot; or a divine being force thing, but what would be the creator of such a force... and if there is a creator then what created that and so on.... (Starting to have a headache thinking about this).<br>

<br>
HP Lovecraft is responsible for the Cthulu mythos, and wrote some pretty good horror fiction. The Necronomicon was a book invented by him in one of books. There is no mention of this book prior to HP Lovecraft, it is totally a work of fiction and it never actually existed (until people decided to write one and sell it, this is what you can actually buy now). Even if it did, the 'history' of the book places it as written around 730 AD. <p>Qaman<BR>

<br>
Anyway, you can't exactly explain evolution to the barbarians and expect them to understand it.  It's much easier to just tell em &quot;I created you.&quot; It's simple, it's true, and it's a way they could understand.  I don't think God or an Angel was ready at the time to sit down for a couple months and explain how evolution works and all the sciences involved.  Or do you really think that there could be a being we call &quot;God&quot; who couldn't have possibly forseen a need for oil?  Einstein would have told you there is a God.  Hawking will tell you there is a God.  Both em them will tell you that because of the perfectly balanced forces they see within science that have no reason to be.  If all electrons had a slightly different charge than what they hold the universe wouldn't exist at all and matter couldn't coalesce (sp?)  Millions of things such as that in perfect balance with the rest speaks of the evidence of God to those men.  Or... you can take the approach that there's an infinite number of universes and all that perfect balance was bound to happen in one of them.  You're never going to find out for sure... get on with your life and live it how you think it's right.<br>
<br>
If there is a such a being as God  (I believe that there is) you can't even begin to second guess Him or begin to have a clue as to what His plan is and what He's taken into account for the progess of humanity.  Hell, we may not even be the end plan.  We might very well be another intermediary stage (like the dinosaurs) laying the groundwork for His real creation.  You can't and won't get an idea of the master plan until He comes and graces you with it.  Til then, live your life and be the person you want to be.  Stop relying on others or digging in holes asking who you should be and why you're here.  Make the most of it.<br>
<br>
Religion... of course there's a lot of jaded views out there.  Religion is/was all run by men on earth though some of you are really lacking in facts on historical evidence or are putting too much stock in it.  A lot of the things stated to have been found are really bullshit... even then a lot of those things that were found were found by men with their own interpretations.  Sorry, I don't accept any of em as fact knowing the unpredictable nature of the individual.  <br>
<br>
Unless there was an instruction book found along with a statue as to why it was made, how it got there, and what it was used for you can't even begin to say what it was for.  I could make a statue on a whim today that showed a man with three heads just for the hell of it and stick it under the floor of a church for the hell of it.  Some idiot a few thousand years down the road would find it and start spouting that there was some significance to it.  Everything could be destroyed today and maybe the only artifact left on earth to show that we were here was a stuffed Barney toy.  What do you think future generations are going to think of us when that's all they have to go by?  Not everything man makes is for any particular reason nor is everything that man does for a particular reason.  A lot of the supposition that goes on today is beyond ludicrous...  hell a lot of it borders on insane.  Example of the typical train of thought...  thousands of years down the road from now they find the moon landing remains up there.  Immediately, they're going to be trying to figure out why we went there and jump to conclusions that today's men were moon worshippers and we were trying to reach our god.  Why else would so much effort have been poured into something like that?  There couldn't possibly be another explanation.<br>
<br>
A nasty habit of archeologists is assuming that the generations of previous men were all guided by their instincts, immature beliefs, and couldn't possibly have been as smart, enlightenened, or emotionally balanced as the people of the current generation.  People were just as smart back then as they are today.  They simply didn't have the technical knowledge that we have today.  <br>
<br>
While everyone is looking into the past for some hidden meaning as to why we're here and how we all got here they typically ignore the present and the future.  We decide why we're here and make it to be so.  We don't need others to tell us why we're here.  We were given a destiny of our own to make.  We do what we choose to do and humanity gets define it's own purpose of being.  No mound in the ground is going to tell you why you're here or what you're here for.  You get to decide that on your own.  The peoples of the past were in exactly the same situation as we are today... they had no clue about any set program for us.   There wasn't any.  They lived life day to day just like we do today.<br>
<br>
You might find peace in the Bible or any religious book but you won't find factual detailed answers.  There's no point in trying.  That's not why those books were created.  The people who created those books knew men.  They didn't know the answers to the universe.<br>

On religion ... hmm.. I am .. agnostic , here are a few thoughts of mine : <br>
<br>
God = Allah = All greek Gods = all nordic gods and so on. <br>
<br>
It s all the same to the one who believes, junt not the same name. <br>

To me, &quot;God&quot; was invented by Man. Religions were invented by Man. All to control those who are weak enough to need something to cling to , to believe to. <br>

<br>
But you can be aware I know a whole lot about Christian Religion and what is behind it. <br>
Maybe the Aztec example was a bad one since I don't know too much about it.<br>
<br>
But what I know ids for example that at the very end of this culture was.. the christian men. They as usual "took care of em", or at least of what was left.<br>
<br>
As I said, if I made a mistake, tell me.<br>

George Carlin puts forth an interesting theory on the subject:  God wanted plastic, but couldn't find any way to make it with the materials at hand, so people were created to make the plastic.  Once plastic was created, diseases that would both curb population and procreation (i.e. AIDS) were introduced, to get rid of the people, but leave the plastic which would be around much longer than the people.  That's paraphrased from a large monologue relating to entropy and the planet in general, but makes an interesting point.  The planet has been around for millions of years.  Dinosaurs are a tiny blip on that timeline, and so far, so are people.  Maybe the desire to know why we're here that always goes unanswered is just another piece of the &quot;get rid of the people&quot; stage in the game.<br>
<br>
I find the whole thing an interesting theory, but haven't gone so far as to dedicate my life to it.  It has to make you wonder though, is the question really why are &quot;we&quot; here, or is it why is it all here? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucraeven.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Craeven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/23/01 11:50:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=281.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A question for you....</span><hr size=1> Amost all of us at one point, or perhaps many points in our lives are faced with these questions.  Is there a God ? Why are we here ? etc etc.<br>
<br>
For me personally, I believe there is a God.  This belief is not the result of indoctrination of Church, School or University ( all of which offer differing views) but rather as a decision based on my personal observations of both the reality I face every day and also on the sciences I've studied (my BS is in Bio-Chemistry). How I came to this decision is personal, and I cannot and will not agrue the validity of each aspect that lead me to my decision.  <br>
<br>
Personally I believe Religion is a man made attempt to consume the ideal of what God is.  The Holy Roman Church did it with the europeans in the early days, converting thier pegan holy days into Christian semblances in order for them to accept the new God in place of thier own.  I think the error is when people associate God with the practices of manmade religion which are simpy an attempt to rationalize God in a consumable manner for the masses.  God is a personal thing.... religion is not.<br>
<br>
As for why the universe is here or why we are here... well I also believe God has a sense of humor.  I think George Macdonald best illustraded it when he wrote the following  in his novel Lilith:<br>
<br>
&quot;Could you not teach me to know a prayer-flower when I see it?&quot; I said. <br>
<br>
 &quot;I could not. But if I could, what better would you be? you would not know it of yourself and itself! Why know the name of a thing when the thing itself you do not know? Whose work is it but your own to open your eyes? But indeed the business of the universe is to make such a fool of you that you will know yourself for one, and so begin to be wise!&quot;<br>

In fact, if there's something you can be certain of when you talk about creation and the origin of the universe is that there is something &quot;greater&quot; that brought it about. Nothing comes from nothing. Just because we dont understand what it is does not mean that it is unexplicable, or that we at some point in existance won't have a revelation of this.<br>
<br>
What is there to prove the earth is millions of years old? Well, lots of things, like bones, rocks, layers of the earth, the fact that it has conditions for us to survive in it.

<br>
dont tell me you think religion is morale.. sinc 90% of all wars in human history has been about religions.<br>
<br>
if there is a god there is also the opposite and since God in that case let his people die in things like cancer, aids, plague took milions , ebola (took mostly the right ones tho)  all these are the work of the loving little god in that case and if you now start whining that NO NO it was the devils fault then why the hell didnt the so called God stop that? is God a sadist? does he like to watch?<br>

nothing of Good happends..<br>
tons of bad things do   i think we have a winner in the south circle...<br>

btw to the one that said that necronomicon didnt exist prior to HP lovecraft , your both right and wrong the necronomicon did NOT exits but the scripts made by the mad arab did.(ohh hes mentioned in the bible)<br>
first womon in eden was not eve, it was Lilith god cast her out cause she refused to be submissive to adam.<br>

God and the religions of the world are different things. Everyone has a religion whether you chose to follow and organized one or not, religion is your set of beliefs. Morale is something partly innate and partly cultural in us, the power to know right from wrong. However the teachings of Christ are moral, and that is hard to swallow as a mere coincidence.<br>
<br>
Second, you can't say that 90% of wars have been started by anything, just becuase you don't even know an approximate number of wars made in our history. That was my point about people not knowing what they are talking about and stating it as fact. Your assumptions of warfare by no means give you power to come up with a percentage, or maybe I am wrong and you are just waiting to be asked to share the source of your powerful statistics. <br>
The wars that have been started in a religious claim cannot be blamed on either God or the Devil, just because they are not the ones who made them, it was men by the gift they have of free will. You are free to make a choice, and you also have to own responsibilty for the acts and consequences of your choice whichever path you chose to follow. Plus this &quot;religious wars&quot; were made by expanding empires that were looking for territory, using religion as propaganda to gain support of their people. The misuse of the gospel cannot be blamed on itself either, because it was the free will of men and their temporal needs who made it happen.<br>
<br>
Lastly, evil and pain in the world does not discredit the existance of a higher being. I find it so silly when people argue that God does not exist, because if he does and is omniscent/omnipotent/benevolent then he wouldn't allow pain and suffering in the world. God cannot give you free will and then intervene and stop all the consequences of your decisions, it would be contradictory. If God wanted you to live in eternal bliss, then he would have created you in heaven, but you wouldn't appreciate the happiness and perfection there, because you wouldn't know anything else. Opposing forces always exist, and in the end they always work towards a balance. Maybe our mission as individuals and as nations and as a world  is to grow to be worthy of this happiness and perfection that we all seek, regardless of your beliefs. Happiness here on earth and beyond in our existance.<br>
Perhaps, that is our purpose.<br>
<br>
I would find it so sad that the fact that we know and understand this concepts, and that we live in a world with free will, sourrounded by blessings and attrocities, that we do have a brain that is only at its 15%, and that we do have answers to a lot of questions we can't comprehend yet to be a simple incident of evolution and accident. I don't know about you, but i have faith we are better than that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=281.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=281.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=281.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=281.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=281.topic&start=101&stop=114>6</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessage?topicID=872.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessage?topicID=875.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=281.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=281.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.threadControl?topicID=281.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=281.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=281.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Diplomacy Corner<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Administration Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6>NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
