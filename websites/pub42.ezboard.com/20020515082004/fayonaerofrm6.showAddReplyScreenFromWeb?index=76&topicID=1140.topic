for this reason many drugs are illegal in most country of the world. <br>
from my knowledge there are not many country where canabis-consume is legal or tolerated. most of you know mainly the Netherlands and since a couple of years  also Switzerland joined the small circle. beside these countrys you can buy marihuana legal in and in a small part of denmark , in its capital  kopenhagen in a quarter called &quot;christania&quot; which is police free area and drugsale is tolerated there . in kamboscha are also no laws agains drug traffic and consume and also in poland and portugal.<br>
the western societys are very  tolerant towards some addictions , which makes many people wondering why other addiction are not acepted in their societys .<br>
I.e.  TV,gambling,everquest, cirgarettes, alcohol ,all kinds of downers and uppers, prozac and other psycho-prescription drugs are wide accepted.<br>
but others not .<br>
i think marihuan should be legalized , no doubt. as many of you mentionend , there is a lot more legal substances out there which are much more dangerous and harmful. just think about all the people that die from alcohol every day (car crashs, voilent acts, diseases caused by alcohol) and about all those that die from marihuana .<br>
in fact marihuana isnt toxic at all , well smoking might cause cancer , but not more or less than smoking tobacco.anyways , i like to point out that i really missing one important point. most of these legal substance are tolerated in our society because their use is integrated in this society and its not an asocial act to consume for instance tobacco , but smoking weed or cocaine base is ...<br>
<br>
due the continuesly prohibition and desinformation many 1st time user of illegal substances have mostly ZERO knowledge about what they doing and what can happen with their body and soul . i think this is the biggest danger of socalled &quot;illegal&quot; substances. many of these 'uneducated' users have no longterm experience and havent learned how to consume.<br>
the best example on the opposite is alcohol , its a more or less widely accept substance , well america is a little different , iam now mainly talking about my european standpoint.<br>
you learn very early that nobody drinks alcohol during the days , you dont drink and work or drive. you learn that from the earliest age. because the people around you have the knowledge how to deal with the sideeffects of alcohol consume and there is mostly some kind of pressure that you dont consume in the wrong situation. <br>
but for most illegal substances which are beeing consumed anyways no matter if legal or illegal are not affected by such social control mechanism , people just fuck themself up in worst case and have to find out the hard way what is good for them and what not.<br>
and this is the problem. not sure how it can be solved , but with more and better knowledge about the use of illegal substances the bad and harmful side effects could be a lot more decreased and would also lead to more acceptance for some substances , not all of them of course. some substance are just total crap i.e. crack,crank(crystal meth). <br>
<br>
btw i consumed almost any popular chemical drug  including mdma,speed,lsd,ketamine,crystal meth,2cb,mda,mdea,dom,dob,ghb etc ...and also most natural drugs  including weed ,shrooms,peyote,several nightshade plants like crimson weed(very dangerous!!!),opium,cocaine,yohimbe,galanga etc ...  <br>
which doesnt mean that natural or chemical is an indicator how &quot;healthy&quot; a substance.<br>
<br>
i stopped with all these experiments around 5 years ago , when i came to a point when i asked myself for the reasons of the consume of all this crap ..  well i found no answer and stopped and stombled directly to my everquest addictions <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  which iam stopped also now. i play very rarely.<br>
<br>
the best substance is dutch weed(skunk) i think , if you realy want to know which is best. but that my personal standpoint , other people like other crap like alcohol or whatever.<br>
anyways if you ever going to try any substance you should  obtain as much information as possible BEFORE the consume , its easy with GOOGLE  you find plenty infos about anything that is important like setting ,dosis,sideeffect , do's and donts etc . The 1st time take the half dosis ! and never consume anything because others told you and your really dont want it actually but think about taking it because you dont wanna stay behind  and look uncool or something.<br>
people with psychological problems like any kinds of psychosys , schizophrenia should stay away from any drugs imho , otherwise you will be permanent guest in your closest lunatic asylum. especially stay away from halluzinogenic stuff like weed,shrooms,lsd,ketamine etc.<br>

Some varieties of it are bred to have very high THC content, and on one occasion some years ago can recall getting the 'breathing walls syndrome' after just a couple of hits off of a proferred joint at a friends' house.  It was also fashionable, about 20 years ago (have no idea if it is anymore) to 'spike' joints with other substances, the most common being PCP or 'angel dust'.  This drug is closely related to ketamine, a rather strange neuromuscular sedative commonly used in surgeries where it is important that the patient must not be physiologically depressed.  This was a very dangerous combination for the unwary...<br>
<br>
I never liked the effects of marijuana, but am of the opinion that everyone should try a hallucinogenic drug (under safe and comfortable circumstances) at least once in their lives.  I can only describe the experience as 'theraputic' <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

<br>
Note: I do not deal drugs, I don't do hard drugs, I buy what I need for friends and I in quantity so all can be happy.<br>
<br>
After my regular PM shift at my work place, a female friend and I decided to go out that night.  This particular female is a heavy drinker, but only ended up having 4 canned beers at the bar we went to.  I on the other hand smoked profusely for the few hours we were driving after the bar.  <br>
<br>
Keep in mind I did not drink.  In fact, I really don't care for drinking as marijuana is a fast, effective relaxent to me.  Anyways to the point of the story, said female had 4 beers, which normally she can do with ease, but on this particular night she was without a doubt unable to drive.  But on the other hand after &quot;I&quot; drove HER home, I went out for another 2 hours smoking almost constantly.  I believe the effects of marijuana do inhibit your reactions etc, but its is VERY easy to control if you are either used to it, or just take it easy.  <br>
<br>
To me, alcohol is the worst of America's problems.  Depression, anger, wife beating, the list goes on.  Granted marijuana induces the supposed &quot;Drug-Dealers&quot;, supposedly supports Afghans, and as a whole seems to be the hell send to the nation.  <br>
<br>
Why is marijuana so bad?  It grows naturally, and when cultured can be harnessed for great phsychological and emotional effects, dulls pain, reduces chances at Glaucoma, easily - EASILY attainable, and its cheap, fast and effective.<br>
<br>
This is the choice for kids now adays.  Who the hell cares if its illegal, as today's youth has readily accepted marijuana on an every day basis.  I could go to school and buy a quarter pound at any time I wanted.  Drive around, boom you know who to ask, all it takes is a phone call and its delivered.<br>
<br>
Alcohol on the other hand requires 19 year olds etc that want to have any affects would have to find a carry-out, know a good bar keep, or end up stealing it.  <br>
<br>
Again these are just MY opinions, and I did write an essay for my college course - &quot;Marijuana: To Legalize or Not&quot;<br>
<br>
On to the point about the supposed Gateway drug.  To me (again my opinion) the drug itself is not a gateway.  Its the people that you must contend with to get the drug.  Say if you were in a nice Suburban nieghborhood and your next door nieghbor grew his own herbs, you would simply walk over, admire his lawn and buy a bag from him.  He's not cooking meth, he's not boiling crack, just a good ol' boy growing dope. <br>
<br>
Now let's say you were downtown Milwaukee (or any city/place for the matter) and you started hanging with a group of people that you know can get pot easily.  Pretty soon these people may start smoking crack, and eventually you will be tempted to smoke it as well.  Next comes the Extacy (heroin as well), and many more X-drugs.  <br>
<br>
See my point?  Well I thank you all for reading through this and please try to remember its just an opinion based on MY own experiences I thought I could do good sharing.<br>
<br>
As a side note, I work at a Nursing home where I get compliments every day on my good natured, compassionate work.  I make people laugh and just have a blast with my co-workers.  I have gotten 3 raises in the last 6 months due to this work and continue to get high honors among the clinic.  I do not smoke before work, I don't smoke during work.  I smoke on the way home AFTER work, before I go to bed, or before I go out and party.  I tend not to smoke if I know I must be doing something (ie. family gathering or the such)<br>
<br>
Thank you, <br>

 I believe fully that making something illegal moves it to a different realm than it occupies when it is legal.  Some people (I'm not one of them) respect laws and are much less likely to do something if it is against the law.  A quote that I use in some training on drug use in the workplace is&lt;i&gt; &quot;What you permit, you condone.&quot; &lt;/i&gt;and I think that statement is very true.   Yes, I would have obtained drugs no matter what, just as I found a way to drink alcohol when I wasn't old enough legally, BUT I had lots of friends who didn't drink until they were legal and didn't use drugs because of the illegality of them.  In my opinion, keeping illegal drugs that way does indeed reduce the demand.  I don't have statistics, but I would imagine that a larger percentage of the population drank alcohol AFTER it became legal again than imbibed during prohibition.  <br>
<br>
One very effective deterrent to illegal drug use that I've seen is workplace drug testing.  I'm not arguing the right or wrong of testing, but I do know that it keeps people from using drugs if they want to keep their jobs.  For normal people (not addicts) drug/alcohol use is a rewards vs consequences decision.  Threat of job loss and/or breaking the law keeps many people away from drug use.  If the drugs became legal that would change.  Addicts, by the way, have this handy little tool called denial that helps them ignore the risks and consequences of drug and alcohol use.  Addicts (including alcoholics) will find a way to get high no matter what.<br>
<br>
Wayfarer, I'm really sorry I seemed to have made you angry.  I wasn't speaking about YOUR experience at all.  My statements were solely about the life I've lived and the lessons I've learned.  I didn't intend to belittle your opinion, nor make snide comments.  Nor was I talking about formal education when I said that experience and education changed my outlook on life.  I was talking about the education that we recieve from living life and learning (or not learning) the lessons presented there.  As a matter of fact, it sounds rather as if you and I have experienced many of the same events, but from different sides of the fence (police vs drug users).  <br>
<br>
One thing I pride myself on is my willingness to learn and to listen to other people, and to let their input change my opinion.  I do, however, as you have seen, value personal experiences much more than formal education.  I'd really be interested to know about studies that truly do adhere to scientific method.  Perhaps I was wrong in assuming they don't exist.<br>
<br>
My 'mysterious' education and experience that I spoke of that changed my mind about the legality of drugs was simply living through becoming addicted, getting into recovery and helping others try to kick drugs, and the view of drug use from here.  Trust me, the scenery is very different than it was when I was a beginner first taking my first hit off a joint.  As a result of my experiences, I now put on training sessions for employers about the nature of addiction and drug/alcohol use and abuse and how to deal with it in employees.  I've recieved quite a bit of formal training in the course of developing and presenting the course, and that has also broadened my view.  <br>
