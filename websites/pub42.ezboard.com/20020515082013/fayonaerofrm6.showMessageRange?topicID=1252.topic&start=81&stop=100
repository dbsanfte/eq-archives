the whole thing is very silly because actually nobody gone to vote in france . i remember just 28% of the people of france went to vote for their president in the 1st run ... and now on the 2nd stage they can choose between a fascist (Le Pen) and a proven criminal (chirac) for collecting illegal 450$ for food per day in the years he was the governing mayor of paris  etc...<br>

<br>
Agreed. I don't think it is likely that France will elect Le Pen, but the election of right wing governments elsewhere who are less than enthusiastic about the EU will make for some interesting conflicts. I wonder if the European Union will be strong enough to encompass these different governments without fracturing.<br>
<br>
Frankly many of the currrent governments are also seen as anti-American and anti-jewish. We in the US don't expect much change there regardless of who is in power.<br>
<br>
Voter apathy has occasionally been a problem in all countries where elections take place. With all the uproar regarding Le Pen's strong showing, I think voting will be heavy for the second round in France.<br>
<br>
France seems to share the dearth of quality choices for leadership that we in the US have complained about for years. It is unfortunate that the best and brightest people steer away from public service while the self serving and dishonest flock to politics in droves. At least that is my opinion. <p>Gulor Gularin

<br>
First of all...without France, the United States of America would exist, most likely. France supported the Rebels in the Americas financially and politically. Please don't think that the peaseants of America could really beat the English alone.<br>
Read you history books.<br>
<br>
Secondly, The US hasn't really had a track record of supporting democraties..far from it.... Venezuela a couple of days ago comes to mind. And many more. A few lawyers/judges are brave enough to question the &quot;God, how we love ourselves&quot; american attitude, and one shining example will be when Henry Kissinger comes to Europe, and we jail his racist ass.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, France has always been almost as racial a country as the US. Do remember that 1/3 of the French population sided with the Nazies during WW2. The Vischy Government sided with A. Hitler, and,....For you Americans.... Even killed 500+ of your troops, when they tried to land in Algiers in Africa. After they saw the futility in opposing the forces, the did what the French are best at....changing their mind, and surrendering...<br>
<br>
Mind you. The French never convicted any of their citizens (those that were still alive) for crimes against humanity...<br>
(They were excellent in sentecing those that were already dead)<br>
<br>
Just a points<br>

I think our founding fathers were smart to exploit the fact the France had a lot to gain by making England look bad / lose revenue.

<br>
A pity those &quot;brave&quot; lawyers and judges won't apply equal standards to the communist leaders of Vietnam who illegally sent their troops into Laos and Cambodia. There were plenty of attrocities perpetrated by the communists in the course of that war as a matter of policy, but you never hear of any interest by those lawyers/judges to prosecute them. They are politically motivated, not morally motivated it seems to me.<br>
<br>
 I do think that the Spanish should be allowed to question Kissinger about &quot;Operation Condor&quot; though. I personally suspect he is worthy of investigation for a lot of crap that went down during his tenure.<br>

I note that the British judge determined that arresting Kissinger was unwarranted. I can almost hear the cries of &quot;puppets of the yankees&quot; already. <p>Gulor Gularin

You're one arrogant piece of crap, aren't you?<br>
WHO exactly told you that you always have to interfere, ''bail out'' and stick your nose into shit thats not your business?<br>
<br>
Again and again the US stick their nose up in stuff that is not their business (besides that they just stick their nose in things that involve money in some way). Noone asks you to do so.<br>
But you do it and at the end you cry that you ''always have to bail out everyone''.<br>
<br>
Yeah you bailed out so much in Vietnam (just to bring up an example.<br>
<br>

<br>
Its fun, or lets say, sad how you guys again and again and again bring that thing up. <br>
Its 60 years ago. It has NOTHING to do with all those damn threads, noone cares anymore. <br>
Stop using one stupid argument for everything posted.<br>
Europe is thinkful the US helped out on WWII.<br>
You were not the matchwinners actually, cause without England, France or Russia (gasp, yes them) the Alliance wouldnt have succeeded either.<br>
Its not all your, and only your success. But you like to take the credit for everything.<br>
<br>
Cut the WWII crap when people talk about Le Pen and Chirac. Cut the WWII crap in general. <br>
Most people have no clue what truly happened on WWII anyways. They just tell and repeat ''what they have been told in school''. Which is mostly not really the truth anyways, but serves the patriotism.<br>
And thats all your country wants. They don't want totell the truth, they just want loyal braindead patriots.<br>
The Attack on the WTC was the best that could happen to your covernment and Bush. THe HUGE wave of patriotism that flooded your country suddenly solved all the critizism on Bush, all the small problems, all the questions about money and taxes and suddenly the whole population, everyone stands behind their president and all his actions.<br>
<br>
Its dangerous to give one man so much power and to give the government so many rights. Whatever they do now, its ok and right and can be hidden behind ''Fight against Terror''. And noone asks anymore. Whatever they do, they just have to say ''Oh we fight the terror ya know'' and noone asks questions. <br>
Isnt it convenient that suddenly they can pump many many billiards of money into the army and weapons? its great. <br>
Noone has a fucking clue for what they need billions of money for Nuclear Weapons, Jets and Tanks when the military strength of the US is 1000 times higher then the one of the whole AlQaida anyways.<br>
<br>
Noone cares anymore that the complete controll over every person alive has taken over. The governement has the right to do with you whatever they want. COntroll you, supervise you, observe you, check what you write on websites and and and (we all have seen Public Enemy and read similar books I assume). <br>
Suddenly this all is 3 times stronger, and everyhting thinks its ok, cause its ''the Fight against the Terror''<br>
<br>
Oh I tell you Bush and the governement are goddamn happy about that all.<br>
<br>
Ok but thats not the topic.. sorry.<br>
<br>

<br>
Yes, and you kinda forgot that you are part of the world and not King.<br>
You forgot that you are like 1% of the world population. BUt you behave as if you were 99% of the world. <br>
You dont give a fuck, but still you interfere with the whole world, with dozens of countries.<br>
Everytime a country does not do what YOU like them to, you send troops or make an Embargo or so.<br>
But you, for yourself, you ''dont give a fuck''.<br>
<br>
Its nice that all your rules and morals count for EVERYONE on the world but for yourself.<br>
YOU are right, whatever you do. Your way is right and your opinion and your actions. NO matter what the rest of the wworld says. We (as the rest of the world) either bends and kiss your feet or we get kicked in the nuts.<br>
<br>
You are neither the Kings of the world, nor are you the lawyers of the world, nor the judges.<br>
<br>
As you said: You dont give a fuck.<br>
SO stop behaving like the moral, court and judges of the whole world.<br>
<br>
<br>
No thats no post about the actual topic.<br>
I just found Santerre's post too disgusting to not react.<br>

<br>
It may be new for you, therfor I will tell you, Jörg Haider is not part of the Austrian Goverment, he is even not elected for the Parlament, and the FPÖ does not lead it.<br>
<br>
Leading the Goverment is the ÖVP, with Wolfgang Schüssel as Cancelor. The FPÖ is the coalition partner of the ÖVP.<br>
<br>
I hope that helps you to understand the facts, wich you maybe should get straight before posting.<br>

And not only USA, please stop thinking when someone says "Please stop putting your nose in my country stuff" this someone is talking about US people. Half of this thread is about this. <br>
Go away you US lovers(which I'm part of) and haters, make your own thread !<br>
Oh and I have a proposition(which I'm sure Halo will follow) for all who are afraid of the Great Evil : Come to France, Find a work, become a citizen, aquire the right to vote, and vote for Chirac (when you have 2 bad choices, you take the less worst :p) !! You have 1 week and a half, better booking your ticket now!!<br>
