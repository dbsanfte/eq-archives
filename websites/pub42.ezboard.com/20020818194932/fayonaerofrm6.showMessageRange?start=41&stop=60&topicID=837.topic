- No, I don't agree with that at all. As Nydia said, did you choose to be straight? Did you think, 'hmm yes, I'll be straight, I don't fancy being gay.' Sexuality is something we're born with, there is no choice. You don't like the same sex, someone doesn't like the opposite sex. <p>Halo 57th Beguiler<br>

There were at least 2 other people upset about the use of Nigger, it was crossed out eventually.<br>

There was several instances where fag was used but no one was upset about that enough to cross it out or make a reply to it. Now granted, people that write on bathroom stalls are (or is it is? man my grammer is horrible) not a good cross refrence of our society.<br>

This may be just me, but if a black man calls me a crakka or cracker, i'm probably going to be offended.  I am probably also going to respond with the following three words: &quot;Fuck off, nigger.&quot;<br>
<br>
Also, in my opinion, one of the worst things the black (i refuse to use the politically correct term) community has done is to incorporate the word nigger into their daily terminology.  The same would go for the homosexual community.  If you dont want people calling you nigger, or gay, or faggot, or lesbo, or whatever, then its best to not to call yourself that.<br>
<br>
As for how I view homosexuality... well, I was raised a Christian.  And even though I have &quot;fallen&quot; there are some aspects of that upbringing that I continue to carry with me.  So I see homosexuality as deviant behavior.  However, you will never see me harassing homosexuals, or &quot;gay-bashing&quot; or in any other way showing contempt for the people who choose (yes, i see it as a choice, just as i see heterosexuality as a choice) to live their lives the way they do.<br>
<br>
Someone made a comment on the views the &quot;bible belt&quot; would have of homosexuality... i just thought it would be funny to point out that when I was in high school Tulsa, Oklahoma had a higher per capita population of homosexuals than any other city in the country.<br>

<br>
- There's a lot of other things in this world to try and understand? The fight to be gay not only represents gay people, Ibudin, it represents a person being who they want to be. How would you feel if we lived in a parallel (forgive the spelling) universe, and as a heterosexual you underwent the same opression and abuse that homosexuals do in this society? Would you say 'It's a tough life, but I understand their hatred and abuse'? Or would you say 'This is who I am.. let me be who I want to be'. IMO, tradition is the single most evil ideaology a society can exist itself upon. Change is the way we need to go. Funnily enough, it's the foundation that a lot of old people think from. You've all heard your grandma's and grandpa's say 'We never did that in my day..', or 'it wasn't like that in my day'. One time my Nan asked me to lock the door on my way out. 'I don't want it left open, some big black guy could come in and attack me'. I had to bite my lip. But you know what? They don't know any different. Like Connodor said, he was brought up to be homophobic and racist. But like him, the people who say these things seem very smart people. So what I can't understand, is if they're smart enough to realize, why aren't they smart enough to change?<br>
<br>
'I wish they all would stay in the closet~!'<br>
<br>
- You'd rather society existed with people hiding themselves, and acting how you want? That's very, very sad. <br>
I think this board is very split in two. From those that want society to exist how they were told it does, or those who want it to exist how it wants to exist.. true to itself.  <p>Halo 57th Beguiler<br>

You have a right to live your life as you wish, and so do they. You don't have a right to shuffle them into the closet, just like they don't have a right to demand that you would pretend to be gay. Don't attend their events, and leve it at that. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

Forcing opinions on others or your way of living your life on others is where the problem exists.

I'd go on religiously, but really, does anyone want that?  Arguments that go on influenced by religion usually go nowhere.<br>

It's a matter of fact that there are gay people, there are people who -hate- gay people for whatever reason, there are people who see homosexuality as being wrong, and there are people who just want a damn taco.<br>

With all due respect, Oklahoma... is a very strange place.  When I lived in Dallas, I used to visit friends in both OKC and Tulsa fairly frequently, and you have to admit that the 'Bible Belt' presence is pretty overwhelming (for those who don't know, Oklahoma is home to Oral Roberts University, Jerry Fallwell and the Christian Coalition headquarters, among other, even more fundamentalist Christian organizations like Tony Alamo's 'Worldwide Church of God' which spews some of the most hateful press I have ever seen).  It is also, interestingly enough, home to two thriving gay communities, and, in a state where alcohol sales are severely restricted (Oklahoma allows liquor to be sold only in 'package stores' which sell nothing else, and then not on Sundays and in very few counties) and bars are few and far between, home to a nationally famous gay motel, which a friend of mine used to visit <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  <br>
<br>
I do find it odd though, that having grown up in that culture (fundamentalist Christian), that you would continue to defend the proposition that homosexuality is somehow a 'choice'.  Do you *really* think that people growing up in a fundamentalist environment, where they are repeatedly told that they are going to hell because of their orientation (that is, if they choose to come out to their families, otherwise forced to live with their feelings in shame, and live in fear of discovery), disowned by their families (happened to a couple of friends of mine), literally kidnapped by their own parents and sent to a 'reprogramming' camp (happened to a friend of mine), harassed, beaten up (happened to several friends of mine), or killed (happened to a member of my support group) because of their orientation, would really 'choose', if they really had a 'choice', to be gay?  Let's not even get into the more 'minor' issues such as not having ones partners legal status recognized, job discrimination, etc etc, ad nauseum.  <br>
<br>
Think carefully about the implications of that claim before you make it.  Being gay isn't all about parades or being able to legally marry or pass your possessions down to your same sex partner, or the right to kiss in the streets.  In my ten or so years in which I was involved with/facilitated a support group in Dallas, we often observed that the individuals who 'crashed out' of the closet the hardest (became very promiscuous initially, followed by heavy activism) were the folks who came from Fundamentalist (Assembly of God, Pentacostal, etc) backgrounds, for two reasons:  One, they had been so heavily repressed that when they finally allowed themselves to admit who they were, all that pressure released with an, erm bang; and 2) for these people, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> there was no going back</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, because there was no way that they could ever return to their former lives and communities (unless they renounced their homosexuality of course, which I have seen several folks try to do, without success), so they tried very hard to make the queer community their home (and defend with a vengeance, I might add).  The gay communities in Texas and Oklahoma are vibrant with all sorts of gay social clubs, from bowling leagues to a rodeo circuit, and much more 'complete' that communities in less 'repressive' locales, in part in order to fill the void created by the total loss of their families and former communities in many instances, as a result of their so-called 'choice'.<br>
<br>
I want to close this post with a true story, that happened to me when I was fifteen.  I grew up in a rather *un*repressive environment (Northern California in the 1970s, to Episcopal parents), and moved to Texas at the end of tenth grade, with my family.  On my first day of class, I was introduced by my Sociology teacher to the class: 'Everyone, this is Debbie, and she has moved here from San Francisco' (the East Bay, actually, but close enough).  Immediately, from the back of the room, some smartass leaning back on his chair looked at me and said: 'Hey, I hear that there are a lot of Gays in San Francisco'.  Being naive, and not thinking anything about it, I quickly thought to myself: ...well, let's see, there are just over a million people in San Fransisco, and about a quarter of them are gay, so that makes... and spoke up: About 250,000 or so of them I suppose, why do you ask?  The reply came: 'Well, I'd get a shotgun, and kill them all...'<br>
<br>
And *that*, ladies and gentlemen, was my introduction to Texas, where I would remain, with a few interruptions, for twenty years. <br>
<br>
Take care,<br>
