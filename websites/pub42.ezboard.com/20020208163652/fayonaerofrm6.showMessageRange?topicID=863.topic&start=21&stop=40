Hagus, i'd say you got two out of three right here.  The one you got wrong being &quot;you are not our peers&quot;.  Every person who plays this game is the peer of every other player.  From the most bad ass and well equiped member of Eternal Wrath to the newbie who just bought the game yesterday, we are all of us equal.<br>

This is the key phrase in this whole thing. <br>
<br>
The name of the game is pull and kill the mob first. If you can do it with 1 do it with one...with 10? whatever just pull it and kill it or someone else will.<br>
<br>
Sorry to say but there is no courtesy in EQ untill after the mob is dead and those who got the kill have taken what they want. People get real friendly then. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=36323">Caean Sacroguerre, Knight of Tunare</a>

<br>
&quot;The situation at Kalorek`Dar is much more like Lozidal than Trakanon.&quot;<br>
<br>
Why did you type?:<br>
<br>
&quot;We perceived this much like a Trakanon or Lozidal raid.&quot;<br>
<br>
I can only respond to what you type.  It takes psychic abilities to determine what you really meant if you typed something different.  You said you perceived this much like a Trakanon or Lozidal raid, when the Trakanon part was flat out untrue.<br>
<br>
&quot;Numbers don't equate to readiness. Having more people in a zone doesn't make you any more or any less ready to engage a target. You say yourself that we had people in the zone while you were gathering. Well, we were gathing too. We just gathered the NECESSARY and READY force faster.&quot;<br>
<br>
But when you say that you perceive this like a Trakanon raid, 17 of us present 3 of you, you imply that you would not leapfrog an already established force in the area... which was an untrue statement, and what I'm calling  you on.  If your Trakanon comment hadn't been in there, that section of your post would not have needed commenting on.<br>
<br>
And like I said, I don't care about the spawn.  We let our guard down because we thought there'd be a mutual respect, we were wrong and you burned us.  There's really nothing more to say about who beat who to the spawn, because that's not the issue I'm interested in.  You beat us there because we made the mistake of thinking you'd respect our presence and took our time (there were THREEEE of you present at this time).  <br>
<br>
This is my real beef, and you just did it AGAIN:<br>
<br>
&quot;Second, as to you who has to ask who... ...sadly it boils down to this: If our two guild run into a similar situation, and there is no communication, then it is likely, based on previous events that Vision will end up winning the race. If our two guilds run into a similar situation, and there IS communication, unless you plan on holding a grudge, our guilds will probably end up working together.&quot;<br>
<br>
You talk of &quot;if there's communication&quot;... but YOU were not willing to communicate with US.  Don't talk about being willing to work together if we only communicate, when you went out of your way to NOT communicate.  WE were not obligated to send a tell to YOU... YOU were obligated to send a tell to US.  You, with the way you are talking, are saying that you'll enter a zone, and if the forces there (that you can plainly see there already) don't send Vision a tell, then Vision will race them to the target.  And I ask you, &quot;Who the hell do you think you are?&quot; that we have to communicate with YOU when you should have been the ones openning communication first.  It's a superior attitude.  The &quot;We don't send tells to those types of people, they send tells to us&quot; attitude.  Sorry, no.  When you enter a zone, YOU do a &quot;camp check&quot;, the ZONE doesn't automatically detect your presence and start sending you tells from every camp across the place.<br>
<br>
Communication was not open because YOU did not open it (we were 17, you were just entering and had 3).<br>
<br>
If your intention was no communication, and to race from the start, there would have been no discusion here and I would not have popped up and said anything.  BUT, you in your post say that if communication had taken place, things could have been worked out.  Funny, saying &quot;well if you would have only communicated&quot;, when you had no intentions of communicating.  THAT'S what you did that has me posting... NOT that you beat us to the spawn.<br>
<br>
Let's say VS is up.  A guild is in force and buffing near his room getting ready to rush in.  Then another guild rushes into the room, not saying a word to the one sitting there, takes VS, then turns to the other guild and says &quot;If you would have only communicated with us, we could have worked something out&quot;.  That's what you did to us.  YOU don't have the right to say you took the spawn because we didn't communicate with YOU...  because YOU should have communicated with US.<br>
<br>
It's not the spawn.  It's the fact that you feel that we must &quot;answer to you&quot; before thinking about taking a spawn somewhere.  That whole section about -we should have communicated with you- is a degrading, pushy, and rude.  You did NOT respect us as an equal (which EVERYONE is), and looked down upon us, as we were lower than you and should have asked nicely for the spawn or something.  It's bullshit, pure bullshit.<br>
<br>
I thank you Sandin54 for those words.  You at least seem to understand... Palimax however only repeated that we needed to communicate with him, disrespecting and degrading us a second time.<br>
<br>
We do not answer to Vision, you do not answer to us.  When you enter a zone, the inhabitants are not obligated to TELL you what they plan on hitting... the person ENTERING the zone is obligated.  The opposite implies a superior, we own this place, answer to us or we take it, attitude. <p>--Lord Hagus Bruichladdich, 60 Warlord of Divine Legion.<BR>

Funny, saying &quot;well if you would have only communicated&quot;, when you had no intentions of communicating. THAT'S what you did that has me posting... NOT that you beat us to the spawn.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Now you have me confused.  You didn't communicate with us at Kalorek`Dar because you didn't perceive us as a threat (small numbers, past experiences).  We didn't communicate with you at Kalorek`Dar because we were ready before you and had what we needed to kill him.  It wasn't in our best interests to communicate with you.  It was in your best interests, however, to communicate with us.<br>
<br>
Explain to me why we should have communicated with you?<br>
<br>
Understand that if your answer is &quot;courtesy&quot; my answer to you will be<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Telling another guild you're rushing to Kalorek`Dar or Lozidal (or any other target their size and nature) is nearly the best way possible to never, ever, kill Kalorek`Dar or Lozidal.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Vision doesn't rush <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  past</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> other guilds to targets.  We won't try to leapfrog over you to a mob if you're already done the work...  ...but we will race you to a fair target out in the open.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Let's say VS is up. A guild is in force and buffing near his room getting ready to rush in.

That's what you did to us.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I disagree.<br>
<br>
Venril Sathir takes (a little) work to clear to the prep room.  In a (a) and (b) world, he's a lot more like Trakanon than Lozidal.  If you were in the &quot;prep room&quot; we would have left you alone.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  ON THE OTHER HAND</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, if you were gathering forces at the zoneline, and we wanted Venril Sathir too, and we had the forces necessary to kill him, you can bet we'd try to get to the prep room first.<br>
<br>
Every encounter has an unspoken Rules of Engagement for the people who regularly kill him, and I'll be honest with you, they're not all uniform and they don't all make sense, so you play 'em by ear.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  We do not answer to Vision, you do not answer to us. When you enter a zone, the inhabitants are not obligated to TELL you what they plan on hitting... the person ENTERING the zone is obligated.

You <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  never ever</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> need to send us a tell <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  ever.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  We are not your masters, and I've got my hands full running one guild.  But, if you think that upon zoning into Cobalt Scar I need to check with you before I try to rally a force for Kalorek`Dar, you're mistaken.<br>
<br>
I strongly believe in the community of this server -- it's why I brought this up in the first place.  I think we should all work together on bigger things.  The loose alliances Vision has formed with other guilds have only strengthened the guilds which we've allied ourselves with.  (Again, ask Exiled Alliance if both of our guilds aren't better off for our relationship.  Ask Final Destiny if we're not better off for talking to each other regularly.)  But community and cooperation can't detract from the thrill of the hunt.<br>
<br>
We didn't kill Kalorek`Dar to spite you.  We killed Kalorek`Dar because he's a footrace and he's on our hitlist.<br>
<br>
I'm not sorry we killed Kalorek`Dar and I won't apologize for it.  I am sorry, that in doing so, we made your afternoon less enjoyable, but at some point, there will be competition and sometimes you win, and sometimes you lose.  This was one of those times.<br>
<br>
Our tactics were fair.  We didn't annul your snare.  We didn't damage shield your puller.  We didn't charm Kalorek`Dar out of your camp.  We didn't camp our guild in your pull path to the Avatar of War. (I couldn't help myself, I love you guys.) We just got ready to kill a fish faster than you did.  We like competition, but we prefer it to be above the board.  The understood RoE for Kalorek`Dar are &quot;whomever pulls his fishy ass first.&quot;  This weekend, that was us.<br>
<br>
I only suggest that you open dialog on mutually interesting targets with US because it's in your benefit to do so.<br>
<br>
If you EVER find yourself at a spawn and would like our assistance, no matter how much you want to badmouth me, you'll find that we're STILL open for requests of assistance and participation.<br>

We made a mistake in thinking you'd do the courtesty of bowing out once you saw our force present first, but didn't.  You didn't beat us to Klor in a race, because we weren't even running.  We didn't think we had to.  That was our mistake as I've said a few times now.  The part about who got Klor first over the other is meanless to what I've been trying to get across to you.<br>
<br>
&quot;Explain to me why we should have communicated with you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Because your post made it sound like we were wrong for &quot;not&quot; communicating with you, when if any communication would have taken place it should have been &quot;started&quot; by you.  In every post in this thread between you and I now, you have repeated that if we're going to communicate while at a contested spawn that it has to be us that starts it and not you.  It's that superior than us attitude that has me posting... and you don't seem to be getting it, because you keep spewing it.<br>
<br>
This whole thing wouldn't have started had you not included that &quot;communication&quot; portion to your post.<br>
<br>
Not wanting to communicate and just rush to a spawn is one thing.  Saying that communication would have stopped the race, when you didn't &quot;want&quot; communication in the first place is very very misleading.  You made it sound as though we refused to communicate with you, so you took the spawn... which completely untrue and couldn't be allowed to stand as is unchallenged.  You make it sound like we're obligated to communicate with YOU, but you're not obligated to communicate with US.  That's degrading and disrespectful. <p>--Hagus Bruichladdich<BR>

<br>
I have never suggested that we &quot;wanted&quot; you to talk to us until you got upset  Prior to &quot;/ooc Who pulled Kalorek`Dar?&quot; we were happy with a foot-race and (now, mistakenly) assumed you were too.  <br>
<br>
I have never suggested that you &quot;refused to communicate&quot; with us, only that, had you have done so, or if you wanted to do so on future targets, we could avoid foot-races and work together to share when it made sense to do so.<br>
<br>
So, as usual, I'll be clearer.<br>
<br>
(a) If you want to get into foot-races for mobs, then, cool, that's ok with us, but neither you or me gets to be upset when the other one wins.<br>
<br>
(b) If you don't want to get in foot-races with us, then, that's cool too. Send us a tell next time you see one brewin' and we'll see if cooperation doesn't make more sense.  Similarly, if we see a situation where it makes more sense to us to work together, we'll send you a tell.<br>
<br>
Kalorek`Dar seemed much more like situation (a).<br>
<br>
In the meantime, we're cool with things being a foot-race.  I leave the matter in your hands.  As with my previous posts, I'll remind you that we're still open to option (b) when it makes sense to do so. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4868>Palimax Sceleris</a>,

<br>
There is no camping in everquest, to paraphrase the rule.  If our guild shows up with sufficient force, is prepared to make a pull and engagement happen before anyone else then we will do so.   If other guilds or conglomerates are present and we are STILL the first ones ready to pull and engage, we will go. <br>
<br>
Respecting another person/guilds camp.  We respect another guilds presence at a mob.  The way we respect that camp is to inform them of our intentions, ask them to go if they are ready to engage, and if not to step aside.  Often we offer a time frame in which we expect engagement on their part before we will go.  If the other guild chooses not to agree to that, or wishes to contest it they are free to do so.  Fair warning is given and time to engage or get out of the way.<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
<br>
CB learns that Venril Sather is up in Karnors and mobilizes a force to take him out for one of our newest wizards to complete their epic.  CB arrives and SoT is in the &quot;pull spot&quot; preparing to go.  After brief communication with SoT personnel, we tell them we will be ready in X minutes to go.  SoT jumps the gun early due to our presence and makes some mistakes that cost them the fight.  Our personnel gain agro without being prepared and we lose a few folks as well.  We all rez the dead, rebuff and we inform SoT when we will be ready again.  SoT is given notice that we are prepared and will pull in about 5 minutes.  SoT pulls, engages and is victorious.<br>
<br>
<br>
CB shows up for Vindi/Statue attempt in KD and begins to set up.  CB is contacted by a leader from EW and is asked to delay the statue kill until they have sufficient force to attack the AoW.  Despite guild members complaints, CB delays the engagement 5 hours + so that EW may prepare.   This is an example of courtesy and respect as well as being able to agree.<br>
<br>
CB shows up for Vindi/Statue/AoW attempt and EW sits at the temple entrance blocking the pull path with approximately mid 30's in numbers.  EW engages Vindicator and wipes out.  CB is prepared to pull Vindi but EW is rezzing in the pull path.  CB informs EW of our intentions and get told to get lost.  CB consults Sony CS personnel to inquire as to the legality of our desires/intentions and what our recourse is.  CS staff informs us to Shout/OOC the pull and to get out of the way and if they do not heed they were warned.  CB complies with said instructions.  CB speaks to an EW leader who we inform of the guides instructions. Further said EW leader informs CB leader that they are still buffing “focus” and not ready.  EW then requests to know the name of the guide.  EW contacts CS personnel informing them that CB is &quot;threatening EW&quot; with said guides name.  CS personnel were brought in to mediate.  CB offered compromise to EW and EW refused every attempt at compromise save their original demands for more time in the amount they specified.  CS personnel force a resolution.  I think I know how I see this, but you be the judge of who forced PnP to be invoked and or further CS personnel interaction.<br>

Calling in customer service to back you up is pure bullshit. Of course they will back you up as long as you don't comit bannable offences, it is not their job to judge within the community. Since noone have claimed that you have comitted bannable offences, your defense is no defense at all, but simply admitting to be a total jerk.<br>
<br>
Many individuals and guilds, probably most, have unpleasent memories of having CS abused against them like that. Bragging that you managed to use CS to have your way and get away with it will not win you the respect of any of these people. <br>
