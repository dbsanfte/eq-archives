Many times I have been in a situation where some other guild moves in and interferes with whatever you are doing, and regardless of who you are..it usually pisses you off.  Now, depending on how the other guild reacts to you is a defining moment with the rest of the process..case in point.<br>
<br>
About 4 months ago, my old guild Mithril Tower was just starting to kill things in HoT.  It had been a long day, learning how to pull, multiple wipeouts..ect.  We had finally broke the 2 wurms in the pit, and had the wandering mobs timed, and was able to pull at our liesure when EW comes along to kill Doze.  Now, after all the crap that we had been thru, to now having it interrupted, needless to say I was pretty pissed.  Sure enough, as they were moving in, a wurm popped, and they promptly killed it.  And as luck would have it...dropped a chain shirt.  But here is the key...THEY GAVE IT TO US!  Did they have to...nope,  but they knew we were there, and even apologized for interrupting us.  That totally changed my attitude.  <br>
When they finished, on the way out..one of them argoed the ToV friendly drakes outside and caused a complete wipeout.  I started dragging thier corpses to the zone so they could have a faster recovery.  Why did I do this...because they apologized...hell they probably do not even remember that event..but I always will.<br>
<br>
Ya..I pay my $10 a month...but so does EVERYONE else..and I make sure I keep that in mind.  You are not playing a game where everything but you is a AI controlled pixel.<br>

Just a few things I wanted to add that were not already covered.<br>
<br>
As soon as we were wiped out by Vindi, we asked very nicely if they could help us with CR and rezzes and basically were told that it was our fault we died and we could do our own CR.  A few of our party members sent friendly tells to the guild leader of SoT asking for either (a) assistance or (b) a break from their failed pulling so that we could send in another party from our guild to recover our bodies and we would be out of their way.  She failed to respond to most of us in *any* manner, good or bad, with the exception of our own guildleader who she apparently cursed at.  I don't know about you but I sure wouldn't want a guildleader that promotes that kind of PR to the server.  After an hour and a half of their failed attempts to pull Vindi to zone line, they started hightailing it out of the zone line with the exception of of about 9 of them (they had about 40-45 in the zone at one time), who apparently decided to help us.  Some misinformation was spread by someone in their guild, because the nine people that stayed were under the impression that we had just wiped at the end, but I *personally* had been dead for about 95 minutes.  I might add that their guild leader logged at this point.  I was told she was still online, but if it was on an alt, no one was willing to give me that character's name or any information otherwise...so in my mind she logged.  Not only that, seems she logged to avoid responsibility for her guild's actions.<br>
<br>
And still I can't understand what they had to gain by pulling Vindicator to zone line... <p>Shortyrez Starfury <BR>
