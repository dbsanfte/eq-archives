<br>
I an a committed player, I put in 30-40 hours a week, sometimes more. I like random. I like the idea that someone being a slow leveler(often due to raids or helping others) doesn't give up the right to win nice things. <br>
<br>
I'd be happy as a clam if the first plate thurg bp my guild ever got in a raid went to a level 50 friend of the guild who was with us that day. <br>
<br>
Why? <br>
<br>
I don't give a rats ass about loot, but I get a pretty nice sense of achievement when I can say &quot;Hey, check out X's bp, I helped him get that, and it was a milestone for our guild.&quot;. <br>
<br>
But then, you can keep on flaming me, after all, everyone who knows me agrees I am one of the most, if not THE  most loot whoringestest warrior on server. Right? And i'm just so envious of your uber leet warriors I could DIE.<br>
<br>
Well, if it makes ya feel better to say it anyway.<br>
<br>
I'll say it again since the foreign concept has trouble taking root in your noggins. I don't care about the loot, your looting rules, how nice it was to let someone get a chance at loot, etc.<br>
<br>
I said(many times) that if you belittled me in the way i'm seeing you belittle that warrior, i wouldn't be tempted to help you much.<br>
<br>
Was it nice of you to let him do it? Yes.<br>
<br>
Is it rude to remind someone they are only there &quot;by your leave&quot;- repeatedly? Yes.<br>
<br>
Are there guilds that wouldn't do even that? Yes.<br>
<br>
Are there guilds that would do that and call it good enough? Yes.<br>
<br>
Are there guilds out there that would thank that warrior for helping out, and not feel the need to let everyone know again and again that a)they didn't need or owe him anything and b)how great they were to let him help? Yes. <br>
<br>
And these are the good guilds. That's the kind of people I like to be around and be associated with.<br>
<br>
<br>
Incidently Connador, english is not a dead language, it is a living one. This being the case, words evolve over time.<br>
<br>
I had a character before this, also surnamed shortpimp. He was a halfling, had that elvis face. I decided since he was a) short and halflings were b) pimp he would be called...wait for it....shortpimp. New char made, gets to 20 and i give him my other chars surname. Happens all the time.<br>
<br>
The real question is why you're nitpicking with my name instead of say, mogur (shamanpimp).<br>
<br>
Ok, so that wasn't a real question. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucrist0.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crist0</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/14/02 11:01:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=804.topic&index=167>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Loot TALK</span><hr size=1> &quot;By your logic, if you wern't necessary for the kill of Serv this weekend, you're some sort of worthless cow.&quot;<br>
<br>
No, that's kinda the opposite of my view. I know its hard to take it in. <br>
<br>
Frankly I wonder about your mental status if you got the above quote out of reading my posts. Get some sleep.<br>
<br>
When you have someone help you do something, like say a warrior not of your guild who you let help you kill a dragon, then go on to talk about how little that person meant to the raid, you belittle them. And you and your guildmates have belittled warrior X a LOT in this post.<br>
<br>
That's rude as all hell.<br>
<br>
And it's not something that'd make me help you at all anymore, if i were that person.<br>
<br>
But this situation ^ is what you are touting as proof that you have such good character.<br>
<br>
I'd say its a pretty poor example of good character, and I think I hit a nerve to have you and so many of your guildmates responding with flames- but none of you ever contradict my point of view with any arguements(although you do like arguing my imagined points of view as you think them up). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/umandari.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mandari</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/14/02 11:15:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=804.topic&index=171>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Loot TALK</span><hr size=1> There is a difference between saying, &quot;We could have done it without you, so there!&quot; and, &quot;The raid would have been successful without your presence (a statement which probably applies individually to every raider present), but despite the fact you're not in Vision and have no real obligation, we'll happily allow you to roll on the scale.&quot; <br>
<br>
Crist0 just can't seem to distinguish between which version was applied to this scenario.  To say that the warrior wasn't needed to accomplish the kill is a simple fact, not an insult.  Saturday my guild brought several guests to Hate; one of them was a paladin who I awarded (not allowed to roll, but awarded) the paladin epic bp.  None of these guests were *needed*, but to say so doesn't belittle them.  We were glad to invite them, and they were glad to be invited.  <br>
