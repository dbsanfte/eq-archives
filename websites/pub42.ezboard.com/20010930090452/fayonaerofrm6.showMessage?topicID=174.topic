<br>
After much waiting (sometimes patiently, sometimes not) on Taino's part. (thank you Taino by the way for allowing me to help with that epic)  Taino and I met at the LR Arena.  My shaman friend had agreed to buff Taino with only the buffs he specifically asked for. (She had originally agreed to buff him, then said she didn't want to cause she wanted me to win, then agreed to the above)<br>
<br>
She called the duel and we began.  I hit my Resistant Discipline button.  Very soon Taino was disarmed.  I watched and waited for him to realize that he was only hitting me for 6 and 7 instead of the 60 and 70 he had been.  Suddenly I see a tell... WTF YOU DISARMED ME!!!!!!  I am now giggling and still running to hit him from behind.  My weapons are proccing almost continuously.  I get a flash of light in front of my eyes that instantly clears.  I am watching my almost constant resist messages.  He hits me with a stun.  Doesn't last long.  Kicking him as often as possible to keep him from casting.  It was very close all the way through the fight.  We get me to one bubble hp and he is at a quarter of a bubble.  He hits his LoH.  I'm dead.  I know it.  I am hitting him almost constantly with Crippling Blows.  I get him beyond one bubble am heading into the next bubble of hp when I die.<br>
<br>
Taino I bow to you.  I told you, you could do it.  I will cringe and gag everytime you call me one of those incredibly insipid names, but you have earned the right to use them.<br>
<br>
We also fought a second time just for S's and G's, and I beat him summarily.  It would have been VERY close had he had his LoH and I my discipline, but I still had 2 full bubb's of hp left when he died.  I still wonder who the caster was who sat through the first fight then left before I got back to get my corpse.  All I remember seeing on one of my passing glances is &lt;Vision&gt;<br>
<br>
It was a good fight... I /bow to you Taino.<br>

<br>
I asked the following buffs from the Shaman, knowing I do not ask for all of them:<br>
Str<br>
Dex (actually useless since I have no procs)<br>
Agi<br>
Speed<br>
AC<br>
I think thats it. Correct me if I am wrong Feb.<br>
<br>
I was completely nervous since i had no idea what was expecting me. I NEVER ever dueled anyone so far. Yes I dueled, but we just dueled for fun, I mostly didn't use any spells or then I tried to duel high lvl enchs or so. So all in all no real duel yet. <br>
What I did not know is that you CAN be disarmed by Players. I never knew this. So after like one minute of the fight I realised that I just hit for 7 or 8 points of damage and somehow saw my HAND in the screen hitting instead of my Soulfire. I was pretty umm... shocked and looked up my Soulfire in my equipment. Of course i wasn't able to follow that constantly running Gnome for around 10 secs during this. <br>
So I rearmed my Soulfire and decided to keep the Equipment screen on (which reduces my view) to make sure to notice asap, if I get disarmed again.<br>
<br>
I was in a complete stress since I not just tried to keep being close to Febreeza, but also cast spells, think of what to cast now, try to avoid her and still keep in the timing for my hits (notice: My soulfire has a delay of 45 but Febreeza kept hitting me constantly, so I had to be in position in time but Febreeza could like just run all around me and keep not being in front of me).<br>
<br>
I did notice that Febreeza interrupted around 50% of all my spells and also resisted 4 out of 5 spells. Soevery like 10th spell really worked out (but yaulp with a cast time of half a second). I did not even attempt to heal myself knowing it was just a waste of time. Same goes for Root. So I after a while decided just to keep yaulping and trying to blind her (Notice: Trying. I think I blinded her twice during that long fight for around 2 secs).<br>
I was pretty surprised to see that I was doing very good actually.<br>
As Febreeza pointed out, she was left with around one bubble as I was down to &quot;I should really cast LoH now&quot;.<br>
I decided to give my greater healing a shot. I really regained concentration and my health went back up equally to Febreezas HPs.<br>
After again around 15-20 seconds I was down again and saw Febreeza hardly losing HPs anymore.<br>
I decided to use my Lay Hands knowing I was about to kill her. <br>
My Life went up and I did nothing else anymore than trying to hit her. Around 20 seconds later I watched her body fall to the ground. The battle was over. <br>
<br>
I had won.<br>
<br>
I was shaking all over. My hands were trembling, adrenaline was pushing through my vains and I was in a complete massacre frenzy. It took me a long time to calm down again and realize that I actually had won.<br>
I was not really happy with my performance knowing I could have done better. But considering it was my first fight, I didn't know about disarm and had no clue how to fight a real Player, it was most I could get out of it.<br>
<br>
<br>
After around 10 mionutes we decided to give it a shot again.<br>
I got rid of all buffs. I buffed myself AND I ALSO buffed Febreeza with all my AC / HP Buffs.<br>
I had less HP than Febreeza but more ATK and AC.<br>
<br>
I did lose this (actually not important, but really interesting) fight because of 3 reasons.<br>
I did buff Febreeza as well.<br>
I DID NOT medd up after the buffs (I really ran out of Mana after 50% of the fight knowing I had no chance without any).<br>
I had of course no more Lay Hands.<br>
<br>
Still I took Febreeza down and forced her to get into her Berzerker Fenzy.<br>
<br>
I am all in all VERY estonished about this all.<br>
My Deepwater Rightclicks are completely useless in a duel since the cast time is way too long and the stun will be resisted anyways.<br>
<br>
I personally tend to really think that I would win a fight against this beautiful and great lvl48 Warrioress with only my skills. <br>
This means: Buffs in advance, mana and of course Lay Hands. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately I gave the rightclick stun and several root tries a shot. This took me down way too long and also the root was pretty useless and made me run out of mana after around 50% of the fight.<br>
<br>
<br>
I won the fight with the rules proposed by Febreeza. So I will call Febreeza the way it pleases me whenever I feel like. I won the right to do so.<br>
<br>
I would like to thank Febreeza for the fight, her shaman friend for the buffs, her druid friend for the ride.<br>
It was a great fight, pure adrenaline.<br>
Actually Febreeza helped me back up on being proud of my class and knowing that there IS a use in being a Paladin. I have chosen this class because of roleplaying aspects. A Paladin just fits the best to me personally. but now I also can be a little proud of me in game and not see myself as a useless but nice guy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I feel much respect for Febreeza and she really was a picture of a bloody Warrioress.<br>

<br>
It really depends though on if you are used to dueling or not.<br>
<br>
<br>
When it comes to paladins, I just assue they have Lay Hands and initially am just taking them down so that they LH. After that, I have an hour and a half before he will be able to Lay Hands again. This gives me plenty of time to find a place to med, rebuff and kill. Rushing the fight is the biggest mistake.<br>

Actually hon you did not ask for dex, and you did ask for HP which I believe (and she can probably tell me if I am wrong) Derth would have hit you with Altuna, as she really didn't want you to win so she would not have hit you with Kragg which is her better spell.<br>
<br>
You did ask for one other, I will have to look up the log to see what it was.  All I remember is you asked for 6.  You and I have listed the ones I can remember.<br>
<br>
To be honest she could have buffed you much better.  If she were buffing me for a duel you would be toast as she would hit me with a MINIMUM of 13 buffs all her best.

<br>
In a duel, no class is assured a victory based purely on their class.  It all comes down to tactics.  I have dueled alot in my time (i am a paladin) and have come to some conclusions. <br>
<br>
1. When dueling against another tank, my biggest advantages are my spells.  If my root sticks on you 80 % of the time, you are dead, and i will not have to loh.  This is true even if you are a level or two above me.  When fighting against a paladin (post 45), high magic resist is key.<br>
<br>
2. When fighting against any caster, resist gear is godily.  If your resists are high enough for dragon raids, the caster is in trouble (this, however, prob doesent apply to wizzys once they get their lure lines)<br>
<br>
3. Never duel a cleric with a mana stone and j boots.  Once i dueled a guildmate while waiting for ragefire (high lev 50's cleric, i was 51), we each tried to run the other out of mana and health for a long time, and did not succede.  The duel lasted about 45 minutes before our guild leader made us stop, and i was still at 90 % mana and full health, and he was about the same.<br>
<br>
4. Pets can be feared (nec pets), and mage pets can be rooted.  Magic resist is key when fighting pet classes as well.<br>
<br>
5. With rangers, esp crydee, bring out your rusty weapons so that they have a fair chance during the duel :P, or oyu can purposefully start with no mana and no buffs to make it even if you are going to use your good weapons (sorry rangers, but ranger bashing was like a ritual for us in one of my old guilds.  The class is very valuable and actually can be quite good duelers, but it is hard to shake old habbits :P<br>
<br>
I have no secrets about dueling shamons or enchanters, i suppose that those could be two of the hardest classes to defeat.  Any other secrets / advice that i may have i will keep to my self for my own sinister purposes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Pallies are easy to defeat, but when fighting against Dammur in paticular - cast a damage shield on the pally that way he can feel like he's doing damage to you. He'll be so happy to see that he's doing damage [even though it is really the damage shield] that he will forget to use his spells or LH.<br>

And yes, as I said I knew I did in no way ask for all buffs she had available. I didn't even reach 2k HP. But as we al know, it was enough. <br>
And yeah, I asked for HP too. I had 1869HP with my buffs. The shammy buff did nt stack with mine and so I ended up having 1905 HP <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Bomb. I do not agree with you. Especially against Warriors, Paladins seem to kick ass. I have heared from many Paladins defeating Warriors that are up to 3-4 levels higher than them. I couldn't really believe it yet, but I experienced it myself. I am not sure whether I can win against Febreeza in a real normal duel with no buffs from the shammy and so on. But I for sure know that I COULD do so if I would be a kick ass dueler (which I am not). <br>
<br>
Paladins are not a great class for duels actually, but the fact they just have this little nice, cute Lay Hands makes them very strong if they know what they do (and I do not know that yet <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).<br>
Same goes for Crydee. I do absolutely not agree that a Pally that knows what he does would be an easy victim in any way.<br>

Crydee was saying that pallies were easy to kill because i was poking fun at rangers.  Do not take that seriousilly tanio.<br>
<br>
As far as hybreds vs pure meele in pvp.  Whe dueling a paladin, it comes down to magic resist.  If you do not resist their spells, you are done, if you do, that it will be a good fight (assuming both sides are well played)<br>
<br>
A SK, however, with a harm touch discipline, is an incredible dueling force.  *but* i think that the damage done by all spells in pvp is something like 2/3 the normal damage (ie a wizzy's 1k dd would only do 650 damage on a full hit, same with a harm touch).  But a high level sk is incrediblely powerful in a pvp situation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucrydeeossiriand.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crydee Ossiriand</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elite Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(4/11/01 4:43:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Taino Won</span><hr size=1> No, I'm saying that Paladins are easy to kill because every Paladin I've dueled made the mistake of letting hide someplace in the zone after he Lay Hands himself.<br>
<br>
Sure they get med and rebuff time too, but I took them down to near death once - I can definately take them to death if I'm allowed to med and rebuff.<br>
