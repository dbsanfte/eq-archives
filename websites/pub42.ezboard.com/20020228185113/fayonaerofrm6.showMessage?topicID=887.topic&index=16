<br>
1) Karana did not have a planes raid system that blocked up the planes for 6 months.  Planes were scheduled one week out on a first come first serve basis (and everyone started at the same place).  The gods/dragons <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> were</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> on a rotation.  Pre-revamp, these could easily take 3-4 months to kill.  Post revamp, the rotation greatly shortened for a while.<br>
<br>
2) Not everyone left Karana because of this system.  Most, perhaps, but not all.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I may be the lone exception, it did not factor into my thinking when I made the decision to move.<br>

I forgot to mention this before.  We did NOT ask RoD to leave.  Or, at least, I did not, and since I was leading the raid that's all that matters.  I am aware of how the server works and the occasional need to share.  Instead, once we were set up we rezzed in their cleric.  This isn't the first time we've done this for another guild in Hate; we've shared planes before.  <br>
<br>
As Esbat said, he posted his thoughts, not those of the guild to which he belongs.  <br>

I'll have to disagree with that comment.  A member of your guild is rude enough to tell me to leave a Plane, whether he / she be the leader of the raid or not, yer damned right I'm gonna cop an attitude.<br>
<br>
How the hell do I know who's leading? I assume that the person sending me the tells has the guild's approval on telling me to leave.  And in that one /tell, my respect for ALL that are connected to that person goes down the drain.<br>

<br>
See, if a situation like this arises between PRISM and another guild, I handle communications or designate someone closer to the scene to do so.  In this case, I was in touch with a couple members of RoD and informed them of my status as leader of the guild.  At that point they know exactly who to listen to.  My guildmates know how upset I get when people other than myself or a designee start sending tells or going on in /ooc; it leads to misunderstanding and miscommunication.<br>
<br>
I don't know why Esbat said we asked them to leave, but I suspect he misunderstood something I said to him during the course of our little adventure.  <br>
<br>
Had I wanted to be an asshole I would either have let them rot or rezzed their melees first on condition they be TL'd out of the plane.  Instead they only had to wait while we got set up ourselves (during which a group of them ported up in attempt to get their bodies, and might have trained us again if they'd made it far enough).  <br>
<br>
Now, I do hope all that is cleared up.<br>

Kartas &lt;sp?&gt; was very apologetic over the Hate incident, stating that he warned his guild where we were but they ran at us anyway.  Oddly enough, when I asked an RoD member who the raid leader was (after PRISM was in Hate but before/during RoD's porting up) I was pointed to Kartas.  And later most of my discussion was with Soulkeeper, who seemed authoritative. /shrug  Another member I talked to after both groups had been settled in Hate for some time indicated a lot of disorganization in the ranks.<br>

Other than some /ooc rudeness to one of our members recently we haven't run into them.  Interesting that other guilds have had similar experiences with them.<br>

[quote]Thats one of the most idiotic and self righteous things i've read on this board, "asked them to leave the plane" ?? where do you get off telling another guild what zone they can or can't hunt in? [/quote]<br>
<br>
Considering they just trained us and nearly wiped us out after we had been established at the safe side pull spot, damn right we asked them to leave- or should have. It is all fine and dandy to sit here and act all offended by my post, but tell me you honestly think it never happens?  The entire FIF policy is in place to determine who gets to say and who gets to leave an area, so I think it happens almost every day.  So, before you sling around words like idiotic and self righteous, think.   Can two groups operate in a place like Hate? Yes.  Do you want to operate together with a group that just trained you, nearly wiped you out and showed almost no consideration for you and yours? No.<br>

<br>
Any more than five mobs is a lot.  Perhaps you think that is "a little", but maybe you should get your facts straight before coming to whine here.  And we did not tell them to leave- in fact, we never even officially asked them to leave.  We suggested they leave.  They didn't.  We shared the plane.  I still think we got screwed.<br>
<br>
I suppose I was silly to think I would get some kind of insight from this board, and your post really walks the edge of being pointless.  You go on to say:<br>

Grow up or move to another server where you can be all by yer lonesome with yer guild in a Plane.....in 6 months from today.[/quote]<br>
What is the point in being a first in force or ffa server when that doesn't work either?  We *were* there first, were set up and started pulling.  RoD entered the plane, trained us and after we were kind enough to do their CR for them so they wouldn't train us AGAIN trying to do it themselves, proceeded to get in our way, move to another part of the plane and start pulling, even though we were (by my understanding of the informal rules of this server) perfectly within our rights to have the plane to ourselves.  <br>
If I'm suffering under a false impression of the way First In Force works, explain to me how.  You don't have to be an idiot yourself, even if you think I'm being one.<br>

This I recognize as being an incorrect understanding of The Nature of Things.  It's *nice* when a guild says, &quot;ah, someone else is here, let's leave them to their raid&quot; (as we have done on several occasions), but it cannot be expected.<br>
<br>
No vitriol or childish flames are necessary to have this pointed out, but posting such questions here is tantamount to asking for such.  Drop it so I can play.<br>

First to attack is basically how it works not first to enter a plane. You can't zone into hate and expect it to yourself anymore than you could zone into seb and expect it. Sometimes you get lucky and get the zone alone, sometimes you don't. <br>
<br>
If you really want to save your headaches in PoH, adapt. You can't be trained a a safe spot (tm) folks commonly use if you aren't at that spot. We are far from being an uber guild in levels or classes, but we manage to survive there fine and haven't used that spot yet.<br>

I never thought it worked, unless the other guild had the kindness to realize by proceeding with their own plans, they would be disrupting the plans of others.  My own guild practices a policy much like this: If we arrive to where we *thought* we were going to be doing something, and another guild/groups is there, we JUST LEAVE and let them have it.  We can find something else to do, and never wanted to impinge upon other's enjoyment of the game.  <br>
<br>
I am willing to admit I thought other guilds and players followed a similar code: that is what I thought FIF meant.  I've already said that: I was mistaken.  About a great many things, evidently.<br>

Thormir, Go play, there is nothing keeping you here besides yourself.<br>

Means, if Guild A does post their presence in Zone X, that Guild B will respect it and not raid this zone the same day.<br>
<br>
Its simply a play nice rule. Matter of respect to eachother.<br>
<br>
Or if you REALLY absolutely do want to raid this zone, at least contact the guild that posted so you can work out something in advance.<br>
<br>
This is my opinion. But maybe i am just bitter considering recent happenings. <p><center><A href="mailto:taino@jollyjokers.com"><img src="http://www.jollyjokers.com/images/taino.jpg" border=0 alt="Send me a Mail"></a><br><FONT color=#ffffff
