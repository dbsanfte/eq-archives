Greetings-<br>
<br>
As I was doing my Karana scouting tonight, I happened upon some strange events in South Karana. Am not sure what this has to do with war, if anything, but figured you would like to know anything amiss. Three named undead gnolls, Triza the Dead, Gezra the Dead, and Braza the Dead up and started wandering around. The strange thing about this is that high-level characters could not kill them, and it was up to a few 20ish PCs to wipe them out. My partner Yarlin and I were attacked a bit south of Infected Paw, as Triza said,&quot;Join us in DEATH. Join us in eternal PAIN.&quot; 2 Were confirmed dead, leaving the leader Triza at large. I asked if any notes or scrolls were found, but no clear answer was recieving. Anyhow, I'd hate to think that the gnolls are involved in the great War to come, but coincidence seems too unlikely in these final days of peace.<br>

There is a new NPC in felwithe i noticed about a week or so ago in Traveller's home (new to me anyway) upon talking with him he mentioned that he had been summoned to return to this world for some reason. ( I had talked to him at length, but thought nothing of it till now) i am poping into the game now to talk with him again and i will post my findings.<br>

OK I just checked this guy out, and am pretty darn sure that he has some important info... i cannot post the text from game like i have seen other do in these post, so if someone wants to do that i think it would benefit the campaign. I will post some of my findings - lost of text is left out to save time of writing it out, but this is the gist of conversation.... <br>

<br>
Tripple amount of Qeynos guards<br>
(all serve Kane Bayle - evil brother)<br>
This is a fact and very conerning. Since the srhine of Bertoxxulous inthe Catacombs is VERY big and filled up with strong and mighty evil persons, I assume that the evil forces would actually have not the slightest problem taking over the Lead in Qeynos.<br>
This is a very concerning danger. I can only think that the reason they didn't take over the city yet, is because they are waiting for another Event to happen or a certain confirmation.<br>
But Qeynos needs to be protected. Immediately and with powerful armies.<br>
We also should send a spy frequently down there as well as our informants through the city.<br>
<br>
Servant of Mayong Mistmoore found wandering<br>
within Lfay, asking questions about FV's<br>
arrival home and reporting back to Mayong<br>
Mayong has his part in this. No doubt. He and Lanys seem to be allied and with the power of Mayong Mistmoore, Lanys will have a full army ready at her hands to bring Firiona in danger.<br>
<br>
Carson Mcabe, once HH Lt, now seaker of <br>
BB Hammer, discovered in The Hole<br>
He seems to have allied with the Bloodsabres. He also takes place in many stories and his signs are sprad all over Norrath. He is after the hammer which we also need to not let happen. Carson is a weapon dealer and a Bloodsabre ally!<br>
<br>
I am also wondering about Neriak. It seems as if theres a division of sorts amidst royalty. The Queen doesn't approve of how the King hunts Lanys. Teir'Dal civil war in the making perhaps? We do know that the King and the Queen seemingly are opposing each other now. <br>
<br>
Heres a surmising theory to the aforementioned. What if the King wants to dispose his wife? What if Lanys is secretly his lover and to become the new king? How else would she keep &quot;getting away&quot; all the time? Anyone notice the heavy influence of Bertoxxulous thats slowly appearing in Neriak starting with the X'lottl household and the other items of note? Lanys also captured Ashteth, the seer of Innoruuk who is gifted with visions of Innoruuk's will.<br>
<br>
lvl50+ spawns in Kithicor during the daylight hours.<br>
We have seen them. We have names and we have screenshots.<br>
They are VERY powerful. The question is, what do they do there? Are they on the Kings side or on the Queens? Or are they a party on their own? Noone has been able to find any explenation of this yet. But for sure it is concerning. My guess is that they are allied with the King since the Queen seems to represent the &quot;good&quot; side of Neriak (if there is one). The King allied with Lanys as m^rumors say, the Queen is hurt. Since the DE's in Kithicor are KOS to everyone, they must be evil. If they would be on the Queens side, I suppose that at least other DE's would be able to at least talk to them or not be attacked. <br>
<br>
Infos about the DEs in Kithicor:<br>

Coordinates: pos695 pos2416<br>
<br>
<br>
Usually plain stone structure by the<br>
named Treant in NK, covered in signs of <br>
Trakanon.<br>
Its not just a sign of Trakanon. Its the signs that appear EVERYWHERE. We have not been able to find an explenation of the sign yet either. But we suppose its a strong sign with an important meaning. Maybe used to teleport. <br>
<br>
Bertoxxulous markings found near the<br>
X'lottl mansion (in Neriak).<br>
This goes in the same example as the treants rock signs. I suppose.<br>
<br>
Tayla Ironforge, which has a deep part in the story was originally a friend of Ton Firepride. Ton helped Tayla move, or more to the point introduced her to Carson who in fact did the move. Again note all the smugglers and Carson's dark elf contact to them outside the gates. Carson moved her to Neriak where she ended up in the maidens fancy where she was picked up by a &quot;powerful merchant&quot;.<br>
<br>
Here is our link. Mare X'lottl. SHE was in the Maidens Fancy where Tayla was. The inkeep THREW the game of Kings Court on purpose. Why? Think about what we know about House X'lottl. The &quot;powerfull merchant&quot; was none other then the Haggle Baron of Cabalis. Tayla Ironforge is STILL there now.<br>
<br>
<br>
The gnomes!<br>
The gnome with Edril's amulet IS in the Hole. He has actually and physically been seen. His name is Nortlav the Scalekeeper. There have been seen gnomes in the plane of hate, several! A gnome has been seen at the release of the Plague in the Lands of Karana. Also have been seen gnome messengers around.<br>
Those gnomes SEEM to not have allied with anyone and just be the good people. but this is WRONG!<br>
Those gnomes seem to in fact be part of this. They are in the background and hardly show up, but if they do, they certainly are involved in very important happenings.<br>
We must send a gnome spy in the City of Ak'Anon and have him find out more. Best would be a gnome necromancer.<br>
<br>
There are those half gods (ooc GMs) appearing and giving quests or giving small bits of information.<br>
So we have that Dark Elf appearing at the entrance of Befallen giving the following informations to a helper within the discussion:<br>
- The source of the Plague is &quot;some gods and I&quot;<br>
- being asked about an attack on Qeynos this eve  he answered &quot;Not this Eve&quot;. Saying this he still agreed that there WILL be an attak on Qeynos.<br>
- There is &quot;a lot more to Innoruuk in Plane of Hate than just the simple diety&quot;.<br>
-  and that &quot;Bertoxxulous is just a Servant of Innoruuk&quot;<br>
<br>
So this means 3 things.<br>
Qeynos WILL be attacked!<br>
We need to gather some forces and finally REALLY clear the plane of hate tosee what is going on there. This is also because (3rd thing we know) Bertoxxulous is a servant to Innoruuk. If this is so, then Innoruuk, again, is our true enemy. We need to find out more about this as much as (in this case) about the TIer'Dal and Dark Elfes in General. Neriak and Kithicor again take a more and more important position in this. We must keep Innoruuk and Neriak in mind, besides Qeynos and Bertoxxulous.<br>
<br>
The other GM event I heared of lately (thanks Brax) doesn't give new information but certainly CONFIRMS!<br>
and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  if anyone still doubts in all this after the words of this GM, then you certainly are not just ignorant, but also completely blind!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
There was a GM talking about a SK in Befallen that should be killed to help Innoruuk. Here is the text.<br>
GM: &quot;Hail Trkahon. Are<br>
you a loyal servant of Innoruuk and do you want to join the forces of<br>
hate?&quot;.<br>
Brax's Guildmate: &quot;Sure I am on your side.&quot;<br>
GM: &quot;Then go to a befallen state and seek out a shadowknight traitor.<br>
He posesses a key. Bring me his key to prove your loyalty.&quot;<br>
Brax's Guildmate: &quot;I shal do so now and shatter our enemy.&quot;<br>
GM: &quot;Very well may hate be your guide.&quot;<br>
<br>
He goes, kills the SK and brings the Key back to the gate of Neriak: &quot;Hail M'Lord. The traitor was no match for me as hate was with me, here<br>
is the key you asked for.&quot;<br>
GM: &quot;Very good Trkahon, you have proven yourself to our forces. Take this<br>
gift as a sign.&quot;<br>
GM gives him a &quot;Enchanted Teir'Dal Bastard Sword&quot; (2HS 23/45 str +7).<br>
Brax's Guildmate: &quot;Thank you M'Lord. If you ever again need my skills call and I will be<br>
at your service.&quot;<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  GM: &quot;Watch for the sign, our forces are gathering and within the next month<br>
we shall strike against our enemies.&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
/ooc<br>
Then the patch message of the 30th May.<br>
There is not much to say about it all then, they are preparing the war with this patch. The first war, supposedly in Greater Faydark (but also Qeynos and Kithicor could be involved since the situation there is also very critical), will take place in my opinion IN THE WEEK AFTER THE PATCH!<br>
I will have to talk to our forces on the next meeting. We NEED to really place our forces during this week. We will NOT have time to start the whole teleport engine when this has begun. We will have to teleport, but we will NOT be able to teleport around 500 people around!<br>
/ooc out<br>
<br>
Lanys is seeking the Malevolence.<br>
She is out there looking for it knowing she wil not defeat Firiona without it. Do not help her with it. If she comes to you and asks you for help, spit in her face and go away. Report where you have seen her! <br>
<br>
There is a lady in Qeynos...Nerissa Clothspinner...her sister left her in the care of Kane Bayle. Has anyone talked to her or seen her recently?? I dont remember seeing her my last trip to Qeynos which is odd because she is usually everywhere. Perhaps she has something to say....perhaps not. But it does seem odd that her sister is located in the Karanas and also she is a ward of Kane Bayle yet knows nothing of his evil nature.<br>
The BLoodsabres want her sister Milea dead. They are afraid that Nerissa or Milea will talk and be a danger for the shrine of bertoxxulous. Maybe they both are not fleeing from the assassins. Namely Rithur Fullome is asking to get her killed. GO to the shrine to learn more about it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Three named undead gnolls, Triza the Dead, Gezra the Dead, and Braza the Dead up and started wandering around in south Karana. I have no explenation of this so far but the fear that this may be the first sign of the union between Bertoxxulous and Innoruuk.<br>
Gnolls are mostly Bloodsabres, followers of Bertoxxulous (note: INFECTED Paw), and who is the Lord of the death? Innoruuk. Very concerning thought! Maybe this is one of the kind we have to expect to fight in the Karanas in the war.<br>
<br>
<br>
The shrine of Bertoxxulous is not just very big, it is also filled up with many dozens of very strong followers of Bertoxxulous. Down there you find the Necromancer Guild, the Shadowknight Guild, the Enchanter Guild as well as numerous people that seem to be high priests of Bertoxxulous that seem not to directly belong to one of the Guilds. This is WAY bigger and stronger than the shrine used to be!<br>
Also what the followers in there have to say makes you think.<br>
Garuc Anehm says 'Kane Bayle and the leaders of this shrine all wish to overthrow the rule of Antonius Bayle. He, for power, and we for the glory of Bertoxxulous. From this city, our diseased lord shall appear and tread across the land spitting death from his mouth and deforming the land. His glory shall be eternal! <br>
<br>
<br>
Another thing we completely ignored so far is the fact that many hints point towards... Kunark. Obviously the Chardokian Royal Family as well as the City of Cabilis is well involved in all this. Rumors say that in fact Firiona Vie has been kidnapped by Iksars. We need to send an investigation team over to Kunark to check the city of Cabilis, the Field of BOne as well as Trakanons Teeth.<br>
Has anone gotten any informations from Cabilis? We need to inspect this further. After all was Firiona suposedly kidnapped by Iksars from Cabilis!<br>
<br>
<br>
This following talk has been mentioned several times, but just now I got aware of its importance:<br>
[Mon May 14 21:51:34 2001] You say, 'What has bertoxxulous released on Norrath?'<br>
[Mon May 14 21:51:34 2001] Roesager Thusten says 'Bertoxxulous is a vile creature who rules the Plane of Disease. His filthy followers are spreading their stain across all of Norrath. We fear they are already here in Qeynos. <br>
<br>
[Mon May 14 21:54:12 2001] You say, 'You speak of the Plane of Disease?'<br>
[Mon May 14 21:54:13 2001] Roesager Thusten says 'The Plaguebringers are followers of the disease lord, Bertoxxulous. We believe a sect of them now operates in Qeynos, but we need proof before we can act. <br>
<br>
[Mon May 14 21:54:25 2001] You say, 'What proof do you require?'<br>
[Mon May 14 21:54:25 2001] Roesager Thusten says 'Someone reported seeing a Plaguebringer roaming about in the hills near Qeynos. We have long suspected that their dark influence was spreading. I am searching for proof that they are now here in Qeynos. If you find anything, please bring it to me at the Temple of Life. <br>
<br>
So he mentiones the Plane of Disease!!<br>
This is the first sign all over Norrath that does namely mentoin this plane! Have you ever seen anyone in Norrath mention something that does absolutely not exist? I didn't.<br>
Also he asks for proof. Lets bring him this proof. We need to get Antonius Bayle listen to us. They need to get this proof so they can and WILL act! Maybe this can save Qeynos or at least wake them up. Qeynos itself seems to be still completely asleep. They do not know about hte dnager that comes from Kane, they do not know about the shrine. They need proof!<br>
<br>
S'raggs letter to Opal Darkbriar says that his forces are gathering. He is sending this to Opal Darkbriar. We need to find out more about Opal. What does he have to do with this? How would they and who would help them? S'raggs mentions the Lifers. These are obviously the Temple of Life's Followers. Do they know more? Did they find out? We must talk to them and share informations.<br>
<br>
<br>
The GM Event that Stimpie mentioned with the evil gnome (GNOME again!) sounds very special.<br>
The infos I miss in your reports is a) where did this happen and b) what happened after you got dispelled?<br>
I think you acted very good by NOT giving him the wand. (ooc: You may have lost a goodie from the GM for helping by doing so, brave soldier!) This for sure was what he did not expect. I would be really interested what happened after he dispelled you. <br>
<br>
Your other report Stimpie.- About this new person in Felwithe that told you he has be summoned to return to this world for some reason. This sounds like a very hot thing. Who in the wolrd would SUMMON people on this world (and who) if it would not be very important!<br>
Any additions are most welcome here too!<br>
<br>
<br>
There have been spottet many missionairies with notes, letters, cards, tactical maps...<br>
Looks like all Norrath is suddenly talkingt eachother. We need to stop these messengers! We need to get those letters and we need to read and see what is going on. So if you see any messenger or messenger to be. Stop them and find out whatever you can.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Please join the Council meeting next Friday (tomorrow), May 17th in South Karana. After you left the bridge from Northern Karana, turn left and the meeting will be on the hill. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
It is critical that we now really get to a point where we KNOW what is going on, that we KNOW where and when and especially WHO will attack. We need to start really placing our forces and also, we need MORE volunteers to help to find out more.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> PLEASE do read this post carefully and THINK about all those details.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Please help me to make a picture out of this all. To see and to report and to find out is one thing. but to combine all those thousands of hints is the most important thing!<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you all!<br>

I have found a Tier'Dal in Neriak who also claims to have been summoned to Norrath, by Innoruuk, to fulfill a purpose.<br>
<br>
[Wed May 16 22:19:04 2001] You say, 'Hail Vorshar the Despised'<br>
[Wed May 16 22:19:04 2001] Vorshar the Despised turns toward you with an icy glare. 'Hail Loriel , I am Vorshar the Despised.  I trust that you have important business with me?  Why else would you disturb one such as I when it is so obvious that I am a being of great power.  I was [selected] by Innoruuk himself to reside in the Realm of Heroes.  I have sacrificed many a mortal in the eyes of Hate and do not be so quick to assume that I would not be delighted to perform such a rite again.' Vorshar the Despised curls his lip in a twisted, sinister smirk. <br>
[Wed May 16 22:19:13 2001] You say, 'how were you selected?'<br>
[Wed May 16 22:19:13 2001] Vorshar the Despised says 'You dare to ask one such as I the will of the Hateful Father?! However, you do seem to be quite lacking in the field of thought and intelligence, which would easily explain why you have not heard my name nor of my [legend]. <br>
[Wed May 16 22:19:34 2001] You say, 'what is your legend?'<br>
[Wed May 16 22:19:35 2001] Vorshar the Despised says 'I, my dear witless Dark Elf, was chosen by Innoruuk's hand during the uprising and fall of the [Combine Empire.] When the Teir`Dal first began to discuss the decision to sign a treaty and join the Empire, I was one of the few who opposed siding with humans and the rest of the lowly creatures of this world. <br>
[Wed May 16 22:19:43 2001] Vorshar the Despised begins to cast a spell.<br>
[Wed May 16 22:19:47 2001] Vorshar the Despised begins to radiate.<br>
[Wed May 16 22:20:00 2001] You say, 'the fall of the Combine Empire?'<br>
[Wed May 16 22:20:00 2001] Vorshar the Despised narrows his eyes, blazing with hatred and a sinister amusement. 'The Combine Empire was a short-lived political structure of many of the world's races that fell shortly after my ascension. Innoruuk had found my faith and devotion to his word and his children so appealing, that he chose me to walk within the Hall of Heroes, although now, I have [returned]. To this moment, I know not why I have been given such a punishment as to again lay sight on and give ear to the grotesque, obtuse creatures of Norrath.' <br>
[Wed May 16 22:20:34 2001] You say, 'why have you returned?'<br>
[Wed May 16 22:20:34 2001] Vorshar the Despised says 'It is the Dark Father's will that I have returned to this realm. I do not question his judgement, nor shall I ever. His will is mine, and I do not question myself. The Dark Father wishes to expand his followers within the Realm of Heroes, and thus, I have been sent as more of a judge and jury for those who would consider themselves [worthy of Innoruuk's recognition] and divine favor. <br>
[Wed May 16 22:21:07 2001] You say, 'I am worthy of Innoruuk's recognition'<br>
[Wed May 16 22:21:08 2001] Vorshar the Despised looks at you a moment, his features emotionless beyond the searing impatience and hatred within his eyes. 'Then you have only furthered my faith in your utter lack of wit. Those who would gain favor with The Dark Father carry a symbol, a coin, that they must give to me for proper judgement. Without that coin, you are but another fool amid a sea of imbeciles.' <br>
