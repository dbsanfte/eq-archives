<br>
Not everyone's ubered out, even in this day and age, nor is uber equipment necessary to do these areas that, in the past, no-one had Velious gear for.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, when I'm running around with my little evil enchanter (L 17 now), I marvel at how easy the zones she is exping in seem compared to when Nydia and Faervas were getting their butts handed to them daily.  Part of that is knowing the zones and your class capabilities better.  But a huge part of it is the fact that my alt is better dressed at 17 than Nydia was at 40...<br>
<br>
Unrest in full level 45 twink gear is a whole different experience than it is in a raw silk robe/banded &amp; rawhide and those uber +2 int &amp; +2 wis rings you just made yourself <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Some people claim that the new additions to the game have 'dumbed it down' that much more at the lower levels.  It is true that the new corpse pre L 10 rules, and the avilability of rezzes at level 14 save a LOT of hiking.  But if you want to test out the game 'easiness' out, make an alt and level it from 1-20 with no outside equipment or levelling assistance whatsoever, and see if those lions don't still hit hard.  I've got a little ranger in thorn mail quest armor, a bronze shortsword, and scraps he looted off orc pawns, he looks just like the little green Sprout <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) who is getting his butt handed to him daily <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  <br>
<br>
EQ can be still be fun and challenging at all levels, even in the face of rampant mudflation.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  And to the newer players out there, as long as you are enjoying what you are doing, don't worry about how someone else plays *their* game...<br>

Also, the new 'channel' system enables people to do 'contract work', if you will, if they wish to see raid level areas without joining a large guild (and the raiding committments these usually require).  Since my own guild containes only 5 level 50+ people (most of our guild is casual players), almost all of my own raid experience, such as it is, has been gained by either freelancing or as a multi-guild thing.  Also, I don't know what the custom was on your former server, but here on A Ro a person in the process of applying to most of the raid level guilds on the server are not allowed to be tagged by any other guild, so many of the 'guildless' folks you see around may be in transition.  Finally, some folks (including myself) find very large raids uninteresting, and don't feel that we're 'missing' anything by not ever getting the chance to take down AoW or see Vex Thal, if you know what I mean... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>

My problem is, I cannot stand not being in a guild.  I miss guildchat, and I miss having people to talk to (otherwise I bug my /friends list constantly, just ask Narf :)).<br>
<br>
I also don't see the point of soloing to 60, but then again this is coming from my personal beliefs.  If I am forced to solo, I kill 2 mobs and am bored almost to tears.  I much prefer being in a group or at the very least having a partner to have someone to talk to than being by myself medding for 10 minutes.  Also I find when you're in a good group, exp seems to flow faster, especially if you're taking out red and yellow mobs with ease.<br>
<br>
Again, I don't see how large scale raids can be &quot;uninteresting,&quot; but that's probably the powergamer in me talking.  To me, the game is about helping myself and my guildmates kill high end mobs, and the challenge involved in getting quests done or zones cleared.  I know there's lots of lag on raids, and not everyone walks away from a raid with something, but there's the fact that I'm helping others that makes a raid interesting for me.<br>

But I do know people who largely soloed their way to 60; and some are actually competent players.  And while I respect the organization and the effort that goes into large target raids, as well as what they are able to accomplish, it's just not my scene (one man's meat being another man's poison, and all).  If it can be done with 3 groups or less (4 being tops for me, after that it just starts to feel like a mob scene, not to mention being overkill for most of the encounters I participate in), I'm all for it; and you'd be surprised what you can do with 15 people in mostly crap gear with an average level of 55, if you have folks who are flexible and on the ball.  My own little guild's raids are usually even smaller, averaging 8 peeps of avg level 46 these days, but we are just starting to get to the high end Kunark dungeons (worked Seb and HS keys this week, Faer and I made our first trip to HS), and into Kael arena, which is very exciting for us.  We've completed several Twilight quest armor pieces for every sub-50 main in the guild (which have unique graphics, our 21st level cleric gets asked all the time about his violet armor, which belonged to the late Eanaman), and our Ranger made her Rallic pack tonight <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

P.S. While I've never 'pledged' any of the major guilds on this server, the usual protocol here seems to be that if you are 'pledging' a guild, you are required to raid with them, but are only allowed to wear the tag during the raid at first, and must remove it afterward...<br>

He now has about 14 characters on 2 accounts no lie all between 6 and 36.  He equips his characters with every spell and takes great care to understand other classes but mainly my point is I didn't want to cheat him of the 1-50 levels but help him enjoy the benifits of high level friends.  <br>
<br>
Mainly if your of the raid mindset go for it level level level if not just toss your tube on the stream and go for a ride. The thing that causes most of us to say level level level is we hear you complain I can't do that...  If your not complaining you should rairly hear some one say level.<br>
<br>
I myself have enjoyed all of it at the same time and don't think I will change.. raid a couple times a week, level a bit and quest a bit.  Although I think leveling is primary to reduce the time it takes for you to do anything leveling is not a requirement. <br>

Ask Narf (the very first person I added to my friends list on this server) about how I'd constantly do /who all friends just to have someone to talk to :) (I've stopped that now, sort of, now that I have people to talk to)<br>
<br>
I constantly bug my friends list (well, not bug, but send tells to them), even though I'm now in a guild.  I am a social person.  I crave contact, people to talk to, joke around with, stuff like that.  That is what I see a guild as being for, along with being able to help people do stuff they aren't able to do (such as a higher lvl quest, an epic, a large scale raid) alone.<br>
<br>
Then again, this is just me and my playing style.  I'm not saying it's the only method, and that the game allows for people to solo to 60, but I just cannot understand why people would want to, if they want to do all they can with the game.<br>
