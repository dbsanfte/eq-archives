I am glad we see how you feel really about Americans.  I am glad you finally showed your true colors, by defacing the symbol of the country that is the reason why you have freedom of speech and ideas.<br>
<br>
I don't care how you view me because with what you did you are now irrelevant and beneath scorn.<br>
<br>
You want Americans to dislike you I believe you accomplished the that with that picture.<br>
<br>
Have a nice day and continue to FUCK OFF.<br>

Halo,<br>
<br>
You said you don't have a solution but ours is wrong.  That is the easy way out, you still aren't saying any thing.  You have an opionion why don't you have a solution in a nice box too?  You can critize people for having an opinion and a solution all day long, having an opinion and no solution just makes noise and offers nothing to this conversation.<br>
<br>
Come up with something.  I want to know how "you" would handle it... we have listened to you tell us we are wrong for days...you keep saying you don't have a clue.  You keep saying you have an opinion but no solution, why is that?  Something that you feel this strongly about you should have some idea about fixing it.  People who go around doing nothing but say that what others are doing is wrong and not offering solutions are just getting in the way of completing the job at hand.<br>
<br>
So in effect since you don't have a solution you can't be wrong.  You don't want to go out on a limb with any ideas.  Those that do nothing never make mistakes and endlessly point out the mistakes of the people who at least try.  That is all you are doing is whining about the people who do have ideas and possible solutions. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uconaddor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Conaddor</A> at: 12/31/01 7:46:07 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uhalochanter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HaloChanter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local Resident</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/31/01 7:46:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=712.topic&index=242>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: John Walker: Guilty Terrorist or Misled American (Long)</span><hr size=1> Agreeing with Gun Happy John over there, that flag took it a bit far. <p>Halo 56th Beguiler<br>

<br>
Im sorry that the cream of the German Army was crushed in the forest of Ardenes (spelling) by a bunch of kids from America and England who didnt get the memo on whole master race thing<br>
<br>
The symbol on that flag isnt my legacy Hart.. its yours<br>
<br>
Your fucked up hatred of the US isnt a result of some moral indignity...  its because you secretly wish things had gone different in 1942.  Your as transparent as glass.<br>
<br>
Its a shame that people like you keep casting this black cloud over people that are more free from hatreds of the past then you are.<br>
<br>
~edit~  what I wrote wasnt mean enough..  let me try again.<br>
<br>
Ya know Hart.  My grandfather was in the Big Red One, under Patton.  While he was on the supply end of things and didnt see a lot of fighting..  give him a few glasses of Wine and he would talk about the US Armys other &quot;conquest&quot; of Germany.<br>
&quot;Got more ass in my Time in Germany than a Tijuana Toliet seat&quot;<br>
Seems German women in 1945-1948 couldnt get enough American Sausage.  It actually amazed the GIs over there that weeks before they were kicking the shit out of these womens Husbands and boyfriends, and yet these women were more than happy to spread the legs like a Rockette for any swinging dick with a rifle and stripe.  <br>
So.. the moral of this story?   <br>
Dont be so hard on Americans Hart. You may have a little in ya..  God knows..  your Grandmother had more than a little in her.. if ya know what I mean <p>Lleauaric Fyrewynd<br>Sorcerer<br>Knight of Eternal Wrath<br>Ayonae Ro<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3749">Gear</a>

I got my statistics from the Unified Sanction of Blearchies Asshole.<br>
Actually, it was a guestimate. From watching TV after sep 11th, prety much half said countries in the world were cheering in the streets. Not good, at all. So don't you even wonder why they are cheering? Something is seriously wrong. And to think that reacting with more violence is gonna do anything. I mean, what??

btw the grafx was more meant to point out the way the us might moving too , i wasnt talking about the past until now. and please please dont tell me who removed hitler from europe, its was mainly the russians , around 20 000 000 russians died to hitlers forces, the americans joined quite late , which is of course no reason to blame them.<br>
<br>
i would like to try also to point out that i really welcome the the fact  that the US initiated the fall of taleban regime in afghanistan , that was truely a very important move for the people in that region.<br>
<br>
but these things have not much to do with the fact that i dont like us american foreign politics , because they mainly based on their economical interests. and often the us administration acts like a bully . <p>Benjamin Franklin: "They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."

<br>
Its something that isnt overly obvious unless you look at and examine the political dynamic in the arab world and even in other areas.<br>
<br>
Lets look at Egypt for example.  The government in this country has a difficult line to walk.  Rampant poverty and extreme unemployment create a huge underclass.   this underclass has one thing to hold on to and cling to.  Religion.  These governments back a couple decades ago had a choice to make.  How do you fight Marxism.  Well the Muslim faith was a sworn enemy of the atheist ideology.. so the governement gave these muslim religious gurus massive sway and support.  Marxism was put up as a direct enemy of Allah.  This is seen in the make up of the modern day Taliban.. and the Muhajadeen.  Fighters from all over the mid east there to fight Russians from expansionism into the Muslim world.<br>
<br>
With the collapse of the communist state, the Mullahs are still there.. still holding enourmous sway.  Yet there power is centered on the ability to create a large enemy for the people to rally against.  What better target for this than the USA? <br>
 <br>
The Media in these countries isnt Allowed to critisize thier own governments yet have Carte blance to rail against the United States and Isreal.   Just as the muslim people were united in the effort to rid thier sacred land of Godless communists so are they united in the effort to remove the Jewish people..  placed there and supported by the USA.<br>
<br>
These mullahs use the United States just like the evangilists of the Christian faith use Abortion or whatever issue motivates people to greater contributions, or greater fanatism to God.. and since these people set themselves as the primary agents of god, though whom God speaks, these peoples devotion translates into wealth and power for them.<br>
<br>
So.   <br>
Youve got a not free press, unable to address the corruptions and flaws in its own system. blaming the USA for the problems since it is unlawful to post REAL cause in many cases as that would constitute a act of treason.   Yet these people need to know why stuff happened and not to be able to draw the conclusion that would lead to a unfavorable light being shined on the government of those countries.<br>
<br>
Still wondering why the US is hated in these areas?<br>
The same can be said about struggling countries around the world..<br>
<br>
Look deeper sometimes..  you get better answers<br>

If any of you in the Georgia area stockpile newspapers, its from 09-23-2001, page E.10. I found it on their site, but they only give you an abstract for free, and the full text for like, 6 bucks a month. I think I'll pass on that one just to prove faust is right, as much as I lubb0rz him.<br>
<br>
However, I will say that most country's foreign policies on terrorism coincide with ours, and therefore we have the support of almost 90% of the nations in the UN.<br>
<br>
Egypt, as someone mentioned, remains Neutral, as do a lot of other countries. On the other hand, although they don't openly support the US and wave little american flags, some, including egypt, give the United States access to their military bases and other facilities.<br>

That should explain some things.<br>
<br>
But for the  most part, half the world doesn't hate us. Putin went to Bush's old high school and cracked jokes, and were doing the PTNR thing with China, and we support their acceptance into the WTO.<br>
<br>
This however, does leave the open end that "oh, well, nation leaders like us, but everyone in their nation wants us dead"<br>
<br>
Sure, there are folks that hate us. But theyre scattered about in these nations. You hear about them on the news because of sensationalism, and, in some cases, they're masked by their and our government because we don't want the american citizens to know that america isnt perfect. our country has commited some atrocities, but we covered them up fairly well. (not that thats a good thing) In the long run, however, the leaders of nations will decide the fate of their countries, and, despite its unfair qualities, as long as the US remains the world's self-elected policeman, we'll continue to get crap as we hack away at what we judge as "evil". <br>
<br>
History is decided by those who write the books.<br>
<br>
And yes, some people hate us. Most of them work for the postal service, which would explain why i dont have my motherboard yet...bastards.<br>
<br>
btw, I believe the only way to put an end to these problems - such as everyone disliking the us due to their interference in _____ policies, is to withdraw our foregin policies from all countries. Im crazy? go <a href = "http://www.lp.org">Here</a> they explain it better than I can.<br>
<br>
until we get our noses out of everyones business, we'll continue to get shit from everyone.<br>

<br>
the press might stay under some pressure in certain arab countrys , but the quite famous tv station AL Jazeera  , is an independent private  TV station , which isnt censored by any government , their TV program is quite controversal ,because they give anyone in the arab world a voice , including bin laden . but thats only a part of their success story , almost any political movement in the arab world can have a voice in that TV station , including  jews and palestinians , and you can receive  al jazeera also in most arab(asian) countrys and some parts of europe<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.almajaz.com/qatar/aljazeera/">www.almajaz.com/qatar/aljazeera/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.aljazeera.net/live.asx">www.aljazeera.net/live.asx</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->    <br>
<br>
this is the link to their livestream<br>
<br>
beside that there is also satellite TV in any part of the world available  including CNN  ....  so that total censorship story is a myth. so i wouldnt underestimate the fact that most people in the arab world have a lot choices to inform themselfes from various sources and make their own picture.<br>
<br>
<br>
and moat these pictures of cheering people in arab country are mainly fakes , most of them have been transmitted  very often in the past, especially these pictures of palestinians burning the Us flag , these from the 80s. i deleted the link to an article from the journalist who made these pictures a long time ago ...  if i find it , i will post it.<br>
but for enterainment purposes they always worth beeing transmitted if they match with the flavor of the month...<br>
<br>
<br>
drakz mentioned : &quot; North Korea also isnt very pleasant with us, but theyre being...handled...&quot;  <br>
i think nobody can handle north korea , they have  + 2 000 000 armed men and a huge variety of mass destruction weapons. its a stalinistic regime. i guess the only one who can handle them are themselfes , once they run totally out of food and energy resources . north korea is already very close to the edge.<br>

<br>
Read what the libertarians say - <br>
<br>
<i>Copied from LP.org </i><br>
<b><br>
In the aftermath of the Cold War, the purpose of America's defense and foreign policy should be to defend the United States, not to act as the world's policeman. Europe and Japan no longer face a Soviet threat and should be expected to bear the cost and responsibility for their own defense. At the same time, the United States should strenuously resist any attempt to coopt U.S. forces into United Nations controlled "peace keeping" efforts. This more realistic defense policy would enable the United States to dramatically reduce its defense spending. <br>
<br>
Certainly America's defense capability should be strong enough to defend the United States. However, the United States now accounts for 37% of all the world's military spending. Another 30% of world military spending is by countries in Western Europe along with Japan, South Korea, and Israel -- nations which pose no conceivable threat to the United States.<br>
<br>
Russia, our former Cold War adversary, certainly represents no military threat. Our military budget is $260 billion; Russia's is less than $80 billion. The Russian army is an organizational nightmare, with 630,000 officers commanding only 544,000 enlisted personnel. Much of its force is incapacitated by low morale and a lack of even the most basic supplies.<br>
<br>
China spends less than $7 billion on defense. The most commonly cited rogue states -- Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, North Korea, and Cuba spend a combined $15 billion.<br>
<br>
Our massive military budget cannot be needed to defend this country. Why then are we spending more than $262 billion per year? The answer lies in our far-flung and ill-advised commitments around the world. America is bearing the cost for defending the rest of the world.<br>
<br>
For example, it costs each American more than $1,000 per year in taxes to pay for the military, while it costs each German or Japanese less than $360 per year. How can we justify these commitments? NATO currently costs American taxpayers more than $90 billion annually. For what purpose? The European Union has a collective population of 370 million, a gross domestic product of $7 trillion per year, and more than two million troops. Surely, these nations can protect themselves from any possible threat. The reinvigorated European Union offers an excellent vehicle to replace NATO and allow European nations to provide for their own security needs.<br>
<br>
Likewise, the cost of American efforts to defend Japan and South Korea totals more than $40 billion per year (counting air, ground, and naval forces designated for that purpose as well as ground troops stationed in the two countries). Yet, Japan is an economic giant and South Korea a budding one. Alone or together, both countries are fully capable of defending themselves.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, President Clinton continued to expand U.S. military commitments around the world. For example, he committed 20,000 U.S. troops for "one year" to enforce a Bosnian peace accord. Three years later, thousands of American troops are still there -- with no lasting peace in sight. Why? Because attempting to enforce an inherently unworkable settlement -- on a battleground for contending ethno-religious factions that have fought each other for hundreds of years -- is to recklessly put American lives at risk.<br>
<br>
Earl Ravenal, a Distinguished Research Professor of International Affairs at Georgetown University, estimates that, if the United States were to pursue a policy of defending its own borders while avoiding foreign intervention, we could realistically reduce our defense budget to as little as $125 billion over the next five years. The beneficial economic impact of such a "peace dividend," if returned to the American people in the form of tax reductions, would be enormous.</b><br>
<hr><br>
basically, people can take care of themselves, and businesses would run the majority of foreign policy in a Libertarian governed world - therefore the best economic interests would be aquired.<br>
<br>
<i>More Lp.org stuff on economy</i><br>
<b><br>
Each year, our government takes over $200 billion in taxes from American consumers and businesses to subsidize foreign governments, foreign companies, and foreign citizens. The U.S. provides foreign countries free defense, direct military aid, direct economic aid, guaranteed loans, and other subsidies too numerous to list. This puts businesses here at a competitive disadvantage.<br>
<br>
The U.S. corporate income tax discourages the flow of capital into America to open and expand businesses and create new jobs. Companies that pay lower taxes can produce goods and services at a lower cost and be more competitive in world markets. Companies that pay higher taxes have to pass those extra costs on to someone -- usually their customers. This raises prices for American consumers and helps price American goods out of foreign markets. The result is lost jobs at home.<br>
<br>
More jobs are lost because of useless regulations and bureaucratic mandates. Large companies must devote resources to comply with each new regulation instead of becoming more competitive, expanding, and creating new jobs. Small businesses, which generate the vast majority of new jobs, frequently cannot afford to comply. They go out of business and unemployment rises.<br>
<br>
The free flow of goods and services is a major source of employment in a market economy. Anything which restricts trade, either within a country or between countries, contributes to unemployment. Democrats and Republicans may talk about eliminating subsidies, trade barriers, and tariffs, but they haven't done it. The current U.S. policy of subsidizing agriculture, limiting imports, and erecting countless other barriers to trade is the exact opposite of the free trade position that our government claims to support.<br>
<br>
To enable Americans to find jobs, we must do everything in our power to give workers, and the companies they work for, the ability to compete in world markets. The Libertarian Party supports five major initiatives to achieve this goal:<br>
<br>
<br>
*Phase out all direct and indirect subsidies to foreign nations, foreign companies, and foreign citizens.<br>
<br>
<br>
*Eliminate the double taxation of corporate profits.<br>
<br>
<br>
*Eliminate regulations and mandates that make companies less competitive and cost jobs.<br>
<br>
<br>
*Unilaterally end all domestic subsidy programs, trade barriers and tariffs.<br>
<br>
<br>
*End government economic meddling that results in depressions and recessions that destroy jobs.<br>

<br>
If the US economy falls..  so will fall the economies of europe, asia and yes even the Middle East.<br>
<br>
The Gulf War was a protection of the world market as much as it was a protection of the US economy.   It is not tolerable to be able to acheive economic status by the use of Military force.<br>
<br>
The fanatics who hate the west (yes they hate Halo and Hartmut just as much as they hate me) mostly dont have access to satellites and cable T.V. , the rank and file, the unwashed masses as it is, from wherein these religious leaders draw power and numbers, are mostly illiterate and with access or means to most media.   Education for many of these impoverished people comes from religious schools who push their own agenda and indoctrination, sanctioned by the government as a cheaper alternative to state funded schools.<br>
<br>
You see the vicious circle that engulfs the lives of these people?   <br>
Like some Orwellian nightmare..  hatred of some great powerful (&quot;the Great Satan') foe is used for the achievement of power amoungst the poor.  <br>
The upperclasses tend not to be as fantatic for the most part... although the power and charisma of these leaders is such that people from all economic levels are seduced into the lies and promises of Jihad.   Religion is used like Race was in the 30s and 40s in europe.   All others are lesser and infidels and must be purged from the land.. only the purity of the Koran is allowed to be in the land Allah designated for his chosen people.  As history has shown..  once people are purged from this area, the size of the designated land grows larger and larger with the ambition of the leaders.<br>
<br>
Hate is usually a bi-product of ignorance.<br>
<br>
If you want to dislike the US..  do so on your own reasons,,  wether is be from a moral platitude like Halo or from conspiritist theory like Hartmut.

If it's true about the world-free effects after september 11th, then ergo it must be true about countries being able to stand alone without America.<br>
The absolute center of America's economy crumbled on september 11th, yet the world continued to turn, unaffected.<br>
I have yet to be convinced that globalisation in economic terms is all that powerful as we're being believed to think. Although if we were talking in terms of culture invasion, then I would very much agree.<br>
