As a magic user, Vanlaan was trained to recognize fellow magic users.  Quietly scoping the tavern, Vanlaan noticed the robed figure in the corner almost immediately.  It wasn't hard to notice the fact that no one sat at any of the surrounding tables.  Vanlaan looked over at Aedare.  Although Aedare was quite capable of taking care of herself, Vanlaan was responsible for her actions and didn't want her causing trouble.  Not here.  Not now.  They needed to keep a low profile for the time being.  Aedare was occupied with teasing the bard.  Well, that was fine.  There shouldn't be too much harm in competition tale-telling.  He had to feel sorry for the bard though; she really had no idea what she was getting herself into.<br>
<br>
Deciding that Aedare was occupied in a non-violent way, Vanlaan got up and made his way towards the back of the tavern.  He tried to act casual, but a Dark Elf Necromancer is anything but inconspicuous.  He mentally shrugged.  'Oh well,' he thought, 'I certainly won't draw anymore attention then our entrance already drew.'  As he approached the table, he noticed the lone figure was watching him.  If he wasn't mistaken, there was a lizard snout poking out from underneath the cowl of the stranger's hood.  'More and more interesting,' he thought.<br>
<br>
He sat down at the table and studied the stranger for a moment.  &quot;Can I buy you a drink?&quot;, he asked.  &quot;I noticed you watching my companion and I as we came in.  Is there something I can help you with?&quot;  He sat back and took a sip of the swill this Inn labeled ale.  He was very interested to hear what the stranger had to say. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=qwik>Qwik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/4/01 8:31:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: story continued</span><hr size=1> just as a kunak rhino in an erudite china shop a taller man with an air of playfullness to him comes down the stairs loudly from the rooms on the second floor. glancing around still trying to get his bearings after a rest from training all day with his brothers of the ashen order he sits down with a flask of mead with a loud well deserved sigh. surveying the room he notices an uneasy crowd all murmering about something he just couldnt seem to make out.  Grinning he sees a delightful treat in that of a master songreaver only she seems quite pre-occupied to be bothered with his requests for one of his favorite songs to remind him of days long past.  Dispite it being painfully obvious that she is busy with a very strange looking lass he rises out of his char and walks over to her with a smirk on his face and whispers &lt;when your done with your friend care to play a song to fill this tired body with some warmth that the fire and mead just cant manage?&gt; with a playfull nod he turns around and goes back by the fire and takes his place back in the chair and slips back into his own thoughts. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/udahrkon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dahrkon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/4/01 4:19:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: story continued</span><hr size=1> One of the &quot;Dark Ones&quot; finaly noticed that they were being watched and approached.  It appeared that he would not have to wait much longer to speak with them...not much longer at all.  However, for as much as he had been trying to speak with them, he dreaded it.  Though he had a good understanding of Common in the time he had been away from home, it was physicly painfull for him to form the words.  And this he did not looke forward to.  But try he must.  He needed allies in this land.<br>
<br>
Quitely he watched as the one he had learned was named Vanlaan aproached.  He sat down next to him and said nothing at first.  They both sat in silence, eyeing each other up.  Then finaly Vanlaan spoke.  <br>
&quot;Can I buy you a drink?&quot;.  The question was completely unexpected.  Drakhnar chuckled slightly and the question that followed was more the one he expected.  &quot;I noticed you watching my companion and I as we came in. Is there something I can help you with?&quot; Vanlaan said.  Drahnar thought for a second, he had to choose his words carefully.  Finaly he spoke in a tone he hoped was low enough that the others in the Inn would not hear.  &quot;Yesss, I have been following for sssome time.  I have been wanting to sssspeak with you.  Firssst I want you to know that I mean you and your friend no harm.  I sssimply asssk that you hear me out.  Asss for the drink, I would like another yesss.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;Note: I used the name Drakhnar here before I registered...was having difficulty doing so.  But when I finaly got in to register, the name was taken.&gt;<br>
