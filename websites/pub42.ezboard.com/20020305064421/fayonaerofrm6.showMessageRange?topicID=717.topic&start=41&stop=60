Now you have started talking about context. Very good idea! Wish you had thought of that from the start. If a woman is dressed up in a sexy manner and hangs around in a streetcorner of the local red light district, she shouldn't be supprised if someone asks if she is for hire. However, like Nydia pointed out, Shadow Haven is not Repherbahn. And neither is most RL listuations.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, if a man is in a red light district and try to pick up a hooker, he is STILL obliged to maintain some decent behaviour and take a no for a no. Happened to my mother once when she was passing through such a area. Some assholes wouldn't take no for an answer. Good thing she was carrying that tear gas gun, we'll never know what would have happened without it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Dreadnok,<br>
I find some of your opinions disgusting. Simple as that. It is true that you are far from alone, and that there are many who are worse. But I don't care about that. Unbelievable as it might seem to you, I understood your principial position from the start, long before you started pulling that &quot;read twice and sloooowly&quot; crap. Go ahead and call emphasis shrieking and the fact that people have emotions hysteria, if that makes you happy. However, it does not make you smarter or more right. No use in fooling yourself like that. <br>
<br>
I don't doubt for a second that you respect certain women who live &quot;up&quot; to your subjective criteria. And I know all to well that there are many who have views similar to your's, and even more sadly there are also many who have views far worse then yours. This does however not make your views any less subjective and personal.<br>
<br>
<br>
Merial,<br>
You say that 90% of all males who see a sexily dressed woman think of sex. I have a hard time believing such a low number to be true, my guess would be 95% or so. But considering the high and increasing number of homosexuals, you might be right.<br>
<br>
And this would prove what, exactly?<br>
Men have balls, true. But also brains.<br>
Arousal give no right or reason to behave like a ass.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, the one who made the comment that started this discussion is a female char, and I'm 99% sure that her player is a hetrosexual female. So your statement isn't even relevant.<br>
<br>
Finaly, I think the natural reactions to how other people look are attraction and lack thereof. Hatred and spite against &quot;sluts&quot; and &quot;gays&quot; and whatever doesn't come from our instincts, but from the bigot society we have been socialized into.<br>
<br>
<br>
treistaania,<br>
While you are right that there is no RESONABLE connection, it seems the warped connection made is simle enough. Dominatrix = sexy = whore.<br>
<br>
You and I don't agree with sexy = whore, and thus we don't agree with dominatrix = whore either. But once you accept the first bullshit statement, then it's very easy to accept the later.<br>

About equal responsibility.<br>
I'm a big fan of that.<br>
<br>
However, the version of equal responsibility I find resonable is that every individual regardless of gender is responisble for his or her own actions. Simple as that.<br>
<br>
Once, about a year ago, a middleaged woman who I normally respect teamed up with a man of her own age and started accusing me of digging up graves and burning down churches. You see, I was wearing a pair of boots. And these people &quot;knew&quot; in their narrow minds that people who wear boots are satanists, and that satanists do such things. <br>
<br>
True enough, they wouldn't have jumped me if I had worn shoes instead of boots. Yet, I refuse to take any responsibility for how they treated me. The fault was the bigotery and idioticy they displayed, not the boots I was wearing.<br>
<br>
Same thing with women wearing cute clothes. Yeah, they turn on many men and some lesbians. This isn't a bad thing actually. And it isn't their fault if some moron gets hostile. <br>
<br>
And finaly, it's a LIE that men revert to apes as soon as they become aroused. A sane man don't become a jerk just because he gets horny. If he behaves like a jerk when he see a babe, he's either insane or a jerk from the start. Probably the later. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

I'm not defending harassment, but if one is naive enough to dress 'like a prostitute' by conventional standards and not expect a lewd coment at the least... I have to agree with Palimax and the other posters above. Many people are morons; almost all of us are bigots. If you have trouble acknowledging these facts, I suggest reading some Jonathan Swift or Kurt Vonnegut.<br>

I don't want drafting for men either.<br>
No double standards there.<br>
<br>
I don't think we should have military drafting AT ALL.<br>
It's not etichal to force people to learn to kill, and it is by no means a necessary evil these days. To my knowledge, modern warfare require small but sharp and extremely skilled armies, not endless hordes of cannonfodder.<br>
<br>
But yes, if there should be drafts then they should be for both genders, rejecting those individuals who are deemed unfit for combat.<br>
<br>
Anyway, of course you are right about bigotery. Everyone's a bigot in one way or another, and the only way to never be treated unfairly is to never interact with people.<br>
<br>
As for women's clothing. Women wearing Burquas and the unreal women of someone's example above about naked women masturbating in the streets, those extremes are the only ones that will not get yelled at BOTH for being too revealing and for being too unsexy. And like Nydia stated above, NOT having sex with strangers will get a woman called whore, just like having it will.<br>

At least we live in a relatively free society. It could be much better of course, there's a lot of moralism and bullshit. But it could also be so much worse. Just take a look at Europe and America 50 years ago, or the moslem world today, and then realize that it could, in fact, be even worse. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

<br>
Willgatus, like you I do not believe that world peace is within out reach just yet. But the warfare is changing from regular old style war between countries and conquest for territory. These days, the wars are between whatever pesky little ones breaking the world order on one side, and the world on the other side. US, NATO, UN, the flag varies from day to day, but the concept remains the same. I don't think this is about to revert back any time soon. <br>
<br>
Defense of nations is becoming obsolete. Defense is still needed, but now it's about democracy and global stability. Gradually, this lower the numbers of soliders needed.<br>
<br>
And in any case, modern soliders are not waring plate armors and wileding halberds these days. While the average man might be physically way more fit for that kind of battle then the average woman, it doesn't take a Arnold Shwartzernegger (spelling) to pull a trigger. Female soldiers isn't stranger then female cops. So yes, IF we are to have a draft it should be for both genders. But I'm quite sure we can live without a drafting system these days. Rely on a professional army instead. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

<br>
In any case, regarding the right of women to be excluded from involuntary military service via drafting... Your opinion may be valid, but do most women wish to give up this privilege in exchange for absolute equality between the genders? I'm a guy and have no intention of speaking for women, but my guess would be no.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, your character does in fact look like a prostitute. No, I wouldn't comment on that in the game because doing so would be really unethical, but you brought up the issue yourself on the forum, so deal with it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Willgatus Airslasher<BR>

My continuing anger was about the conclusions some people drew, not about their opinions about the look as such.<br>
<br>
Personally I have never seen a prostitute wearing anything remotely similar to Edeina's wardrobe. I know for a fact that many prostitutes wear rather plain clothes at work. Perhaps it's that I live in a colder climate, perhaps it's that most prostitutes I have met have been off work, perhaps it's that you guys doesn't frequent red light districts very much either, and simply make assumptions about how prostitutes look. Doesn't matter. Perhaps much more importantly, I have seen many women who have exactly NOTHING to do with prostitution, and who dress much more revealing then Edeina. Some was heavily into the S/M-scene, others simply liked the look without meaning abything with it.<br>
<br>
Maybe most satanists and neonazis wear boots, maybe not. In either case, there are MANY who wear boots without being either. If someone think I look like a satanist (hey, I have long hair and beard too!), he's free to think so. But he have no damned right to be rude about it, and it is NOT my fault if he do.<br>
<br>
Same thing with women and sexy clothing.<br>
Both in RL and ingame. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

<br>
Everyquest is a Game, non of the Characters are real.<br>
<br>
About 75-80% of the people who play EQ are male, even though there is a balanced # of Female characters.<br>
<br>
Men who see a cartoon (that's starting to look more and more real) that looks good, they are going to flirt or whatever. They hide behind their character, and it's easy. I know, cause I catch myself doing it =P<br>
<br>
In an ideal world, it's the &quot;men&quot; who should change. It shouldn't be the &quot;female&quot; who has to conform, but, unfortuantly, we don't live in an ideal world. Females must know, and understand this. If there going to dress up &quot;Sexy&quot; expect to be treated like that. <br>
<br>
**I am NOT jusitfying men taking advantage of females in anyway!**<br>

But if you wave a steak infront of a Lion, expect him to jump at it, and don't be upset when he does, cause you know it's coming.<br>

The ones who should change are not horny hetro-men and lesbians as such, but the sneering moralists and those who think that their hornyness is a excuse to be a jerk. And many, maybe most, of the former are females.<br>
<br>
And while this discussion have been mostly about RL, I do agree with Urgetakil that it gets even sillier when it's about toons. Like that monk incident Nydia told us about. Did that little creep really think he could &quot;get lucky&quot; by behaving like that, in a game of all places? Bleah! Or people passing moral judgements over toons or their players because of looks. Those who don't like the Luclin models can just turn them off. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

I guess all the guys I know must be secretly gay or something...<br>
<br>
What I've been able to sum up of this discussion is that <br>
A) Men turn into horny ape men when they see a good looking woman in sexy clothes. <br>
B) Women who dress sexy bring it upon them selves to be treated as hookers. <br>
C) Everyone who dress sexy are hookers?<br>
<br>
I mean God, surely this can't be true about men can it? I mean I've heard the "guys think about sex 70% of the time every day" but I've taken it as a joke really.. <br>
<br>
To make babies and to bring your race onward is a natural instict in all animals (including humans). But considering the human race has indeed evolved belive it or not, I would imagine that the urge within men and women for that matter would've become a bit smaller. As it sounds in some of the posts here we haven't evolved an inch.<br>
<br>
It is indeed very human to judge people by their look though, the actual judging process is depending on your own upbringing and opinions though... What may seem as a hooker to Billy-bob, may seem as a good dressed girl to James.<br>
<br>
And no... I don't think the leather look on High elves make them look like hookers, they aren't revealing much at all really. I mean God it is leather! It has to look like leather then too, leather clothes in general do indeed form after your body. <br>
<br>
To end my rant.. I just gotta ask... You are kidding right? About the "modern day men" with the insticts of a cave man? <p><IMG SRC="http://user.tninet.se/~mhf993y/anna/sig.jpg">
