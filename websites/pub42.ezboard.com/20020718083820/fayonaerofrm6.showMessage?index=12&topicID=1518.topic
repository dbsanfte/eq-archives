Now, keep in mind the huge shitstorm that was cause about wizards and their MB a few months ago, and about how unfair it was calling for a nerf for it.<br>
<br>
Well, where to start. For the last month or so, Kunark dragons have not been up more than maby an hour or two before being killed. Mostly by wizards Manaburning. I know for a fact, that a few wizards have been doing this to get phat lewtz and mad cash. Now, what is my beef with this.<br>
<br>
First of all, this is a GIMP way of getting cash. Secondly, by doing so, you are taking away content from the corresponding tier guilds, who might have wanted to kill the mobs in the regular way.<br>
<br>
A few wizards might argue that they are doing this to help a friend or guildy get their epic piece because their raid wiped with 50 people or so. Now, in theory, this would be ok once or twice. BUT, in reality what is happening, is no different from what velks is doing. Encounters are being gimped, and people are taking the easy way out to get their shit. What this produces in the long run is poorly skilled highlevel players wanting to join the &quot;highend&quot; game.<br>
<br>
Having just gotten their epic, applying to &lt;insert uberguild here&gt; to get more phat lewtz or raid shit is just natural, right ? Well, not only are these people lacking basic raid experience, but they have been participating in removing content from other players to learn of.<br>
<br>
As said earlier, a few wizards on this server have been burning mobs for phat lewtz to sell, without thinking about the corresponding tier guilds loosing out on content to play. Now, the excuses some have given me is, kunark is so easy, it doesnt matter. Well, if it is so damn easy, go make a REGULAR GROUP and try killing &lt;insert mob here&gt; with less people in the regular way, actually earning the kill. It takes no skill to MB, at all.<br>
<br>
Also, with the rising interrest for instakilling mobs with MB, on the wizards forums on lanys, the idea to start Manaburning Sontalak has arisen. Question is, where will this end. Sontalak is a mob with 90k hps, so MBing him is pretty simple. Klandicar has about 80k hps, Zlandicar has around 90k. More content to instakill with the manaburns! How far will this go ? once all the MB wizards have cheaply aquired their HARD EARNED Sleepers Tomb keys, would they start selling them ?<br>
<br>
Surely, the thought must have struck them allready. For instance, Zlandicar's Talisman (handed in returns ST KEY) is droppable. Winning this in a MB feast, how much do you think you could make for it.<br>
<br>
The novelty of Manaburning Kunak content has worn off. Its not the wow aspect of it anymore, yet it continues to happen. Reasons stated above. Sure, there are wizards using MB to help out friends who direly need the help, which is generally accepted and no problem with. But, there is a Manaburn channel where wizards gather to find shit to kill for fast cash.<br>
<br>
To top this off, this morning, i was asked if i had LifeBurn and if i was interrested in helping burn down Talendor. I replied as i have done before, i would take no part of gimping encounters like this and stealing content from lower end guilds, especially not by instakilling the mob without there being a challenge to it/cheat-killing. I asked one of the wizards why they would go kill Talendor, and she replied &quot;shrug, im poor and need the money&quot;. This wasnt for helping some friend, or getting someone their epic. This was done purely out of greed.<br>
<br>
It has become clear that this skill handed out to wizard is being misused, and it is in dire need of changing. The best solution would probably be to just flag kunark dragons +VS/Sonta/Kland/Zland immune to MB. Nothing more really. Either that, or the wizard population of Lanys needs to stop misusing their skill to garner their personal greed.<br>
<br>
Remember, easy != fun, challenge = fun. If you want to kill the pussy ass dragons even tho you're above the tier, do it with style and make it a challenge, thats the least you can do.<br>
<br>
To end this little rant, USE YOUR GODDAMNED FUCKING HEADS AND STOP GIMPING PUSSY ASS DRAGONS TO GET RICH WITHOUT RISK! <br>

<br>
The &quot;regular way&quot;???  My opinion (and I know a LOT of people will disagree with me) is who cares HOW a mob gets killed.  Isn't the point to kill it?  If 12 manaburn wizards can organize and get to a target before a guild can organize a couple of groups, then they earn their kill as much as anyone.  Also you can't say that these wizzys didn't put in a lot of time and effort to earn this skill, so let them freaking use it.<br>

With 6 or 7 guilds fighting for ST keys, at what rate do you think keys are currently flowing into any <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> one</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> particular guild?  I know XA/RiP/FD had a well documented argument with each other for keys recently - so I know there's competition for 'em; but with a ST key entering the server every day (a generous estimate based on plenty of patches and a fast repop on the five key droppers), how long will it take the 400 members of the half a dozen guilds fighting for keys to get them?  Especially considering that I don't think any of the B-guilds are doing Ylenak or Sontalak as part of their normal rounds.<br>
<br>
Since Sontalak stays up beyond patch day, how long before 12 Manaburn Wizards all get keys?<br>
<br>
Look, I don't begrudge manaburn wizards their day in the sun.  Heck, I'm looking quite seriously into it's little bastard cousin, Lifeburn.<br>
<br>
This is a question of degeneracy.  Let me activate the way-back-machine.  For a long time I used to judge Magic: The Gathering events (yeah, I know - DORK!) and used to be friends with some of the set designers.  Because of that, I got into playtesting Magic sets before release.  A few months before, say, Prophecy was sent to the printers, we'd get a spoiler list and run to Kinkos to make stickers to put on a thousand or so land cards.  Anyway, to try to tidy this up, in the long list of things we checked for was the ability for cards to be &quot;broken&quot; in large numbers.  Ancestral Recall, an old and broken card, is only &quot;powerful&quot; all by itself.  Give someone an entire deck full of them and it creates situations that make the game unplayable.  They don't make Ancestral Recalls any more.  The original &quot;plan&quot; for degeneracy in Magic was that the rarity of cards would provide balance.  You wouldn't have a full set of Moxes, a Lotus, a set of &quot;power blue&quot; and a dozen dual lands because you wouldn't have opened cases upon cases of cards.  Once they realized that obscurity and rarity alone wouldn't do, they had to actually balance cards.<br>
<br>
Perhaps Verant was as shortsighted about the &quot;rarity&quot; of MB wizards. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4868>Palimax Sceleris</a>, Guildleader <a href=http://www.guildvision.org>Vision</a>, Grandmaster <a href=http://www.base-nine.org/available_tinkering_items.htm>Tinkerer</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/utremainbladesinger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TremainBladesinger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elite Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/20/02 10:51:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1518.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.theunholytrinity.org/cracks_smileys/cwm/big/firemad.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: fair enough</span><hr size=1> I just think by the time a guild gets enough MB wizards to make any of this targets trivial, the target would have been trivial trough regular means anyways. <p>"the day i die will be the day i shut my mouth and put down my sword" - Tremain, 60 Warlord

<br>
Even making the assumption that none of the 12 had keys in the first place, I would say any guild that could field 12 mb wizards in the first place would have zero problems taking down Sont. If they weren't from the same guild, then there is no real change in the dynamics anyways, since the keys would still be going to different guilds. Of course, the fact that Sont usually isn't killed in the first place means that it really doesn't change much either.<br>
<br>
And actually, they knew this kind of thing could happen and weren't worried about it.<br>

Do I give a fuck that 12 wizards can manaburn Sontalak?  Nope<br>

Do I think they are fucking retarded for bragging about it and basically asking to get nerfed?  Yes<br>
<br>
I don't care if they get nerfed either way.  Makes little difference in the game in my opinion.  I think the best way for them to get nerfed if VI chooses to do so, is to add a 30 sec manaburn &quot;buff&quot; to the mob like the Donal's BP.  No way a bunch of manaburning wizards can kill a mob without a semblance of a regular raid party with them.  <br>
<br>
Well whatever, I'm sure VI would take back &quot;complete heal&quot; as a spell in the game if they could. <p><a target="Shortyrez Starfury" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=45788">Venerable Shortyrez Starfury</a><BR>

In retrospect, Complete Heal was a mistake, and it's probably one of the first design considerations for any large target that goes into the game.<br>

And MB isn't even on the radar for the big targets these days though, mobs that are in the 750k+ hp range. Everyone talks about MB being great and it is on mobs that don't have a huge amount of hp, but you do a lot more damage with normal nukes plus have better aggro control on what are now considered large targets. Not to mention it is easy to counterract anyways, just surround the mob with a number of decent guards. <p><a target="_blank" href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380>Qaman</a><BR>
