<br>
I agree that someone's personal appearance should not affect or ever be brought into the game. However, when someone has security issues and are in a place of leadership, bad results happen, and it becomes an issue in game. Darus is insecure, and if someone so much as suggests that he made a wrong decision or awarded something to the wrong person, they are on his shit list...<br>
<br>
I did leave things out - about how he cut and pasted different tells of mine to make it look like I threatened him. He lies to protect the bubble he has made for himself.<br>
<br>
On that note, after I get married and settled down, 59 Ranger looking for guild who doesn't have one insecure asshole dictator for a leader.<br>
<br>
And to the other members of IO who I have grown to love, I'll miss you all while I'm away, and I hope I find things different when I get back. And I hope other people don't take out their frustrations with Darus on you.<br>

i.e.  If you've ever been wronged, you're not ALLOWED to defend yourself, but must suck it up and accept the slander and lies that everyone eventually makes up about you.  That's the life of the anonymous (anyone who uses the internet).<br>
<br>
Every single person who has ever defended themselves when they've been wronged here is ALWAYS, and I mean ALWAYS met with &quot;I now have no respect for you!&quot; from everyone.  Which logically tells me that no one is &quot;allowed&quot; to defend themselves.  No matter how much evidence they have that they're innocent, no matter how calm and rational they display the facts.  No matter what they do, the witch hunt will live on.<br>
<br>
No one EVER even TRIES to see the victums side of things, they ALWAYS jump on them from trying to set things straight.  They ALWAYS take the side of the person that wronged the poster, because the poster is trying to defend themselves.  Why are they defending themselves in a public place?  Because those who wronged them paint an incorrect picture of the victum to anyone they talk to about the subject.  ALLOWING someone to think that you've done something wrong when you haven't is the greatest crime of all.  Could you, the reader, stand it if someone out there spouted lies about you to anyone they met who was curious about the subject?  Wouldn't you, the reader, want everyone to know that they're not true?  Or would you, the reader, just sit back and ALLOW everyone hearing the story to believe it and not care?  Myself, I know that I couldn't stand knowing that someone out there thinks I've done something wrong when I have not done such a thing.<br>

It's funny how much of a conclusion you can draw without knowing all the facts.  Kincaidia already posted this on our boards, where it was dealt with.  The outcome was not what he wanted so he thought it best to bring it here to try and slander Darus and IO.<br>
<br>
I said this was a damned fool stupid thing to do.  I never said that I lost respect for him.  On our boards my words were something to the tune of &quot;I like you, I trust you and I respect you&quot;.  This however was the WRONG way for him to do things.<br>
<br>
Are you in IO?  Were you online when all of this transpired?  Did you send a tell to Kincaidia asking him what happened?  Did you see him say &quot;this is bullshit someone stick up for me&quot; in the raid channel?  Do you really have any clue what the story is or would you rather jump on ME for 'persecuting' Kincaidia?<br>
<br>
As for your cynical musings about the internet and these boards, I have no comment.

Personally, I don't think I'd want to be in a guild led by one person that &quot;gave orders&quot;.
