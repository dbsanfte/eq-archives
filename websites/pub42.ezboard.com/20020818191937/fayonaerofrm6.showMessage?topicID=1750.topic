Once the Legends service, with its <br>premium content and enhanced service guidelines, was announced, a group of <br>us quickly realized our intention to migrate to the premium server. Through <br>aggressive cross-server recruitment, promotion, and planning, we insured <br>that by the time the Legends service opened we had a large number of <br>customers ready and willing to join us. For example, on the day the <br>Stormhammer went live, we had approximately two hundred accounts committed <br>to our guild. The Township Rebellion guild of today still includes at our <br>core many of the 200 accounts present on that first day. Our reasons for <br>moving to the server was to instigate a fresh start and partake in the <br>promised new content and experiences legends had to offer.<br><br>Since that day our guild has consistently demonstrated a high level of game <br>play. Our accomplishments in-game has matched and exceeded that of the top <br>guilds in Everquest. We very quickly became &quot;the&quot; high profile guild to <br>measure the success of your service by. And you will note we always <br>portrayed a positive attitude towards the server, staff and players. Our <br>site and accomplishments were very quickly picked up and viewed by players <br>on all servers in Everquest.<br><br>When the inevitable conflicts over spawns with other guilds on Stormhammer <br>began, we have consistently demonstrated a willingness to resolve problems <br>and issues as suggested by the staff of the Stormhammer service. For <br>example, we delayed waking the Sleeper in Sleeper's Tomb for over three <br>months at the suggestion of the Stormhammer staff. Additionally, for a <br>substantial time prior to the institution of a &quot;calendar&quot; system, we <br>voluntarily avoided spawns more representative of earlier phases of the game <br>(e.g., North Temple of Veeshan) and devoted our guilds focus to new content <br>which was not in pursuit or conflict with any other guild entities on the <br>server. When the &quot;calendar&quot; system was forced upon us, the staff admitted <br>that spawn conflicts were greatly diminished, primarily due to our voluntary <br>efforts.<br><br>We quickly became disillusioned with the promises of new content, events, <br>and enhanced services that had initially prompted us to move to the server <br>and form a community here. It became painfully obvious that even the Server <br>GMs were being held hostage by the fact that they didn’t have the content <br>that was needed to pacify so many high level players on the server.<br><br>Although we did not agree with the calendar system forced upon us, we did <br>accept it in order to work with Sony staff and provide a comfortable <br>community for the server. We also placed our trust in the Customer service <br>staff when they said “trust us it will be OK”.<br><br>After participation in the calendar system, our guild has reached the <br>conclusion that a definite and distinct pattern of biased exists against our <br>guild through repeated acts of the Customer service staff (and principally <br>through decisions made by GM &quot;Bordael&quot;). In short, the calendar system is <br>not being enforced fairly and is currently administered so that it is biased <br>against TR.<br><br>We have considered this previously and did not take steps then, due to the <br>repeated assurances from GM &quot;Bordael&quot; that such favoritism would stop, the <br>inconsistencies would halt, and the Legends as advertised would appear. In <br>direct discussions with Senior GM staff we were assured that certain actions <br>on the part of the GM’s would be “looked in to” and “addressed”. Time frames <br>were placed on questionable GM decisions with promises of direct action <br>items to ensure these occurrences would not happen again. None of this has <br>happened; in fact the inconstancies have grown in number.<br><br>We view this as a &quot;bait and switch&quot;, and as such, fraud. We were drawn to <br>the server under false premise and guidelines of an “enhanced gaming <br>service”. The incidents which support this bias are too lengthy and numerous <br>to recite in this letter, however, rest assured they have been documented <br>and have been submitted in our complaint to the San Diego Better Business <br>Bureau, whom we've been informed has on previous occasion dealt with nearly <br>100 cases against SOE.<br><br><br>Notice<br><br>Given the current environment on the Stormhammer server, the bias <br>demonstrated by the staff, and our inability to amicably resolve these <br>issues through the normal customer service process, SOE is hereby placed on <br>notice that Township Rebellion henceforth withdraws and no longer recognizes <br>as legitimate, the calendar system forced upon the Stormhammer players. As <br>of July 24th, 2002 Township Rebellion will return to the &quot;free-for-all&quot; play <br>style found on nearly every other Everquest server.<br><br>This decision has been made with great sadness. Each one of Township <br>Rebellion's accounts represent players who have dedicated enormous time, <br>energy and money into SOE's Everquest game. Many of our players have over <br>one year of Everquest play time. Many of our players have been involved with <br>Everquest since the beta test. In short, we take our gaming experience in <br>Everquest seriously. Which is why are taking such extreme measures in light <br>of the waste of our time and money.<br><br>We recognize that our planned course of action may cause some friction with <br>the Stormhammer staff. Rest assured that TR members will play Everquest in a <br>manner consistent within the rules issued by SOE for game play across all <br>servers. However, SOE should also recognize that if the Stormhammer staff <br>takes arbitrary retaliatory action against our players/accounts, as we are <br>most certain GM &quot;Bordael&quot; will condone and attempt to influence us with, we <br>would consider such actions as a serious matter. Any such action will be <br>documented, internally reviewed, and publicized if found to be arbitrary or <br>capricious. In this regard please understand that TR's web site receives <br>over 10,000 hits daily from Everquest subscribers and we have reached <br>agreement with other top-tier (i.e., endgame capable) guilds and <br>guildleaders (e.g., www.fohguild.org &quot;Furor&quot;) in <br>Everquest for the use of their web space for additional publicity as well as <br>popular Everquest message boards.<br><br>In closing,<br><br>We are quite unhappy with the situation on Stormhammer. We came here under <br>the premise of an enhanced gaming experience only to have imposed on us a <br>calendar system NOT publicized or accepted prior to the populace leaving <br>their former servers.<br><br>We feel in its current state it, most especially with the lead GM in charge <br>of customer service on Stormhammer being GM &quot;Bordael&quot;, we will never be <br>treated with un-bias toward our guild. If another lead customer service GM <br>can be assigned in replacement of GM &quot;Bordael&quot; perhaps we can move forward.<br><br>Our goal is not to cause problems for any player or staff member. We simply <br>wish to play the game we have grown to love over the last nearly four years. <br>Should the server staff wish to continue with its change in policy and <br>attempt to impose a calendar, TR is willing to consider relocation to <br>another server, under certain circumstances. As you may recognize, players <br>who transfer to Stormhammer must leave behind their friends/guilds on their <br>home servers, and therefore, the current ability to return to our home <br>servers does not offer a solution or the prospect of splitting up the guild <br>we have built here, in good faith, for six months. Nor does the ability to <br>move to a different server without any equipment received through years of <br>hard work make much sense.<br><br>Also keep in mind the premise that people moved here under is quite <br>different than that initially promised by SOE. Thus, TR feels some what held <br>hostage here on Stormhammer and is willing to consider relocation, en mass, <br>to another Everquest server, so long as that server:<br><br>(1) Does not have an existing &quot;end game&quot; guild;<br>(2) Is a server not specifically marketed to non-Americans<br>(3) Players may transfer with all their equipment and skills intact; and<br>(4) Any TR member who is willing to make the transfer can take advantage of <br>the transfer.<br>(5) The server is not subject to a newly created or imposed GM calendar <br>system or restraints outside the normal play policy in any way.<br><br>If SOE would be willing to entertain such a transfer, please contact us, you <br>will find us most cooperative.<br><br>Keep in mind we are happy to stay on the stormhammer server and continue <br>playing as was the intent on our move here and under the guidelines and <br>indications of what the server was to be prior to the move. However as <br>stated we will not be doing so under the arbitrary calendar imposed by the <br>server staff. Otherwise we are happy to discuss the above solution as a <br>win/win for everyone.<br><br>Again, it is in no way our intention to cause friction, problems, or <br>instigate any conflicts on the server. We simply wish to play the game.<br><br><br>Yours truly,<br><br>Township Rebellion<br><br><br><br>I hope they cancel all 200 accounts, thats a nice hit in Verants pocketbook and might teach them a lesson. 10k per month lost. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ubroneb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>broneb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local Resident</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/23/02 5:51:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1750.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: But we've got the biggest...</span><hr size=1> would be nice if they cancelled their accounts but people who play on Stormhammer are addicted.  <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=135928>Nosegoblyn PrettyPrincess</a><br>Lvl 55 Ogre Shaman of CoFE.<br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uwonderbiff.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wonderbiff</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wanderer</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/23/02 5:54:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1750.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: But we've got the biggest...</span><hr size=1> I just have to laugh when I log in and click sort by population and see stormhammer at the top...

We write to you on behalf of our guild, which represents approximately 5 players, many of which pay for multiple peon subscriptions to partake in the enhanced experienced promised by the Everquest Peon service.<br><br>Our guild has been a part of the peon service since before the Stormhammer Legends server became live. Once the Legends service, with its premium content and enhanced service guidelines, was announced, a group of us quickly realized our intention to not migrate to the premium server because it is a ripoff. Through aggressive cross-server recruitment, promotion, and planning, we insured that by the time the Legends service opened we had a large number of customers ready and willing to join other guilds. For example, on the day the Stormhammer went live, we had approximately two hundred accounts committed to other guilds. The Bixie Company guild of today still includes at our core many of the 20 accounts present on that first day. Our reasons for not moving to the server was to not get ripped off and partake in the promised beta testing experiences legends had to offer.<br><br>Since that day our guild has consistently demonstrated a high level of game play. Our accomplishments in-game has matched and exceeded that of the bottom tier guilds in Everquest. We very quickly became "the" low profile guild to measure the failure of your service by. And you will note we always capped on the legends server because it blows, and pretty much pissed off your staff and players. Our site and accomplishments were very quickly picked up and ridiculed by players on all servers in Everquest.<br><br>When the inevitable conflicts over spawns with other guilds on Stormhammer began, we have consistently demonstrated a willingness to sit in the stands and make fun of the schmucks who bought into the legends scam. For example, we delayed waking the Sleeper in Sleeper's Tomb for over three months at the suggestion of the Stormhammer staff (Then Eternal Wrath fucking woke him up and stole our thunder, /rude!). Additionally, for a substantial time prior to the institution of a "calendar" system, we voluntarily avoided spawns more representative of earlier phases of the game (e.g., North Freeport) and devoted our guilds focus to new content which was not in pursuit or conflict with any other guild entities on the server. When the "calendar" system was forced upon TR, the staff admitted that spawn conflicts were greatly diminished, primarily due to our voluntary efforts.<br><br>We quickly laughed our asses off at the schmucks who moved to stormhammer with the promises of new content, events, and enhanced services. It became laughingly obvious that even the Server GMs were being held hostage by the fact that they didn’t have the content that was needed to pacify so many high level players on the server.<br><br>We all chuckled when you forced the calendar system on the stormhammer whiners.  We're glad the dumb bastards accepted it so that the Sony staff didn't kick their asses off the server and cut short our daily entertainment. We especially like the “trust us it will be OK” line you used on that bunch of jackasses in Township Rebellion.<br><br>We would like to commend your continued efforts to screw over the Township Rebellion guild on the Stormhammer server.  your definite and distinct pattern of bias against TR through repeated acts of the Customer service staff (and principally through decisions made by GM "Bordael") are to be commended!<br><br>We got worried when we heard there were repeated assurances from GM "Bordael" that such favoritism would stop, the inconsistencies would halt, and the Legends as advertised would appear. We were dismayed when spies relayed to us discussions with Senior GM staff where TR was assured that certain actions on the part of the GM’s would be “looked in to” and “addressed”. We heard that time frames were placed on questionable GM decisions with promises of direct action items to ensure these occurrences would not happen again. Thankfully, None of this has happened; in fact the inconstancies have grown in number. Way to go!  Stick it to them bitches!<br><br>Your "bait and switch" tactics are truly ingenious. Drawing those fuckwits to the server under false premise and guidelines of an “enhanced gaming service” was a very nice touch. We all know that the members of TR are too stupid to have gathered any evidence to support this bias.  By the way, the San Diego Better Business Bureau doesn't really give a shit about a fucking video game, so don't sweat the complaints on file there.<br><br>Now to our complaint.<br><br><br>Notice<br><br>It has come to the attention of the Bixies that certain whiners are trying to sway Verant to change from a calendar system on Stormhammer to a Free For All environment.  We are against this for the simple reason that listening to the TR players whine and bitch about sharing phat lewt provides us with considerable entertainment value.  As of July 24th, 2002 Bixie Company will continue to play in a "free-for-all" play style on the Ayonae Ro server.<br><br>This decision has been made with great sadness. Each one of Township Rebellion's accounts represent players who have dedicated enormous time, energy and money into SOE's Everquest game. Many of our players have over one year of Everquest play time. Many of our players have been involved with Everquest since the beta test. In short, we take our gaming experience in Everquest seriously. Which is why are taking such extreme measures in light of the waste of our time and money.<br><br>We recognize that our planned course of action may cause some friction with the TR guildmembers.  Rest assured that BC members will play Everquest in a manner consistent within the rules issued by SOE for game play across all servers. However, SOE should also recognize that if the TR guildmembers takes arbitrary retaliatory action against SOE, we would consider such actions as a serious matter. Any such action will be documented, internally reviewed, and publicized if found to be arbitrary or capricious. In this regard please understand that BC's web site (www.b-company.org) receives over 5 hits daily from Everquest subscribers and we have been considering making several "dummy" web sites that will get at least as many hits daily.<br><br>In closing,<br><br>We are quite happy with the situation on Stormhammer. We came here under the premise of an peon gaming experience only realize that it has a pissing and moaning entertainment component too!<br><br>We feel in its current state, most especially with the lead GM in charge of customer service on Stormhammer being GM "Bordael", we will get considerable bang for our almost $15/month. If another lead customer service GM is assigned in replacement of GM "Bordael" the Bixies will be VERY MAD!  Bzzt!<br><br>Our goal is not to cause problems for any player or staff member. We simply wish to play the game we have grown to love over the last nearly four years. Should the server staff wish to change its policy and get rid of the calendar on Stormhammer, BC is willing to consider relocating Eternal Wrath to another server (So the Bixies can RULE this server!), under certain circumstances. <br><br>Also keep in mind that when SOE started considering getting rid of the Calendar system the Bixies had considerable time invested in reviewing web sites that had whines posted by the stormhammer population.  The premise that the Bixies moved here under is quite different than that initially promised by SOE. Thus, BC feels somewhat held hostage here on Ayonae Ro and is willing to consider relocation for Eternal Wrath (So Bixies can RULE this server!), en mass, to another Everquest server, so long as that server:<br><br>(1) Does have an existing "end game" guild of at least the Bixie Company caliber;<br>(2) Is a server not specifically marketed to non-Americans (Or fucking foreigners as we like to call em)<br>(3) Players may transfer with all their equipment and genitals intact; and<br>(4) Any EW member who is willing to make the transfer can take advantage of the transfer (Unless their name is Sami, he has to stay and summon Dartanian mod rods on demand!)<br><br><br>If SOE would be willing to entertain such a transfer, please contact us, you will find us most cooperative.<br><br>Keep in mind we are happy to stay on the stormhammer server and continue playing as was the intent on our move here and under the guidelines and indications of what the server was to be prior to the move. However as stated we will not be doing so under the arbitrary calendar imposed by the server staff. Otherwise we are happy to discuss the above solution as a win/win for everyone.<br><br>Again, it is in no way our intention to cause friction, problems, or instigate any conflicts on the server. We simply wish to play the game.<br><br><br>Bzzt!,<br><br>Bixie Company<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/upinchesgiyems.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pinches Giyems</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local Resident</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/24/02 12:58:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1750.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .....</span><hr size=1> Gee wiz I hope this group of intellectually stimulating letter-writers comes to dominate A.
