I made this wizard and played him for about 2 hours before I found my way out of erudin. I then couldnt figure out how to get out of the game and turned off my computer so I could go to bed. The next day I logged back into everquest and tried out one of the other server names, and was quite supprized that my wizard was gone. I went to a different server each time I logged in for some reason for about three days before I actually figured out that each server had its own characters and you couldnt go where ever you wanted to. By the time I realized this and settled on one server it was Karana server and I had moved from an erudite wizard to a hi elf wizard, and I spent the next 10 levels in greater faydark. I remember going to orc hill and being awed by how tough that place was. I died there and lost my corpse so bad so many times I couldnt possibly explain it. By this time I had gotten several of my real life friends into the game and at level 12 we all decided to go on an adventure to qeynos. Over the next several hours the 4 of us took the boat to Freeport and got binds and worked our way to qeynos, it was some of the most scary fun I have ever had in this game and I was sold from there on out.<br>
<br>
One of these days I should log into all the servers and find those old wizards of mine hehe, I know I have one on Sol Ro. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uothen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Othen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local Resident</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/18/02 11:06:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2807.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.drott.cc/eq/othen.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Your first EQ memories</span><hr size=1> my friend traning the living hell out of me for an hour straight <p><A HREF=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=42139><IMG border=0 SRC=http://zencore.home.mindspring.com/othen.jpg></a><br>

Memories from a noob Enchanter.<br>
<br>
As an erudite a RL friend took me to Qeynos &quot;because it was better than Tox&quot;. Well i needed to go back to Erudin for something alone and being blind after the boat docked I ran off the end of the moving platform. I didnt know how to swim but managed to get gate off. Back to the Qeynos gates for me.<br>
<br>
Dying from the skellies at the ruin in Q-hills and not being able to get my corpse back.<br>
<br>
Taken out by several bandits in WK. Still have yet to extract revenge.<br>
<br>
The first time I zoned into EC. All the other places I had been where so quiet. Then BOOM! Auction channel is going crazy. I was so scared lol.<br>
<br>
The first boat ride to FV from BB. I went LD on entry into TD and when i got back in I was on the top of the shuttle so scared I was going to fall into the water and not get on the Maiden Voyage.<br>
<br>
Dispelling a rooted group member in LOIO and took all his other buffs too. I think to this day he thinks the mob dispelled him. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

We had a escort however, it was a High level Druid w/SOW so the trip was a little faster then our many other failed attempts. I can remember once we made it to Freeport we got settled down. Found our way around the town, and decided to venture off to see East Commons, what a site, The screen was impossible to read, /auctions flashing by so fast, it was hard to believe anyone could interpret what was being sold. But the one thing that stood out in my mind, more then the journey, more then the tunnel, was this &quot;Tiny Skeleton&quot; I don't remember what zone it was in, I don't remember who saw it first, but I do remember when it kicked all of our a$$'s, a lvl 5 Enchanter, lvl 5 Monk, and a lvl 5 Cleric.

It was in the last days of beta, and I was a newly created level 1 darkelf shadowknight. I was in a strange blueish place, and a guard was nearby. I walked up to him and tried to hail him. But alas, I never reached the &quot;i&quot; button. You see, the first letter got the conversation started allready, and I died as I typed the second letter in hail.<br>
<br>
Second EQ memory: <br>
It was shortly after release. I was a barbarian warrior, and really wondered how I was supposed to navigate that icy maze. Ack, another spiderling train! [Loading, please wait...] Ah, there's the city!<br>
<br>
Third EQ memory:<br>
Alyce was such a powerful mage. She saved me from a really scary monster, and then we shared a camp even though she was way too high level to group with me. You see, a wide range of monsters spawned in that place, and I could take the small ones that was green to her anyway since she took the big ones that was red to me. This was in a butcherblock goblin camp. She was level 9, I level 4.<br>
<br>
Fourth EQ memory:<br>
Wow, those guys are really uber! They can kill Dervish Cutthroaths. I wish I could do that...<br>
<br>
Fifth EQ memory:<br>
Ehrm, this game does NOT look good on a pentium 166 with no 3d-card whatsoever. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

I was running back to the guards and some druid saw me with three orcs on my tail, healed me and kept me alive.  Afterward, she buffed me and gave me sow. -- for free.  I decided I wanted to help others like that too when Cara 'grew up', and I have striven to do so.<br>
<br>
I came to Freeport at level 6 because I was bored and wanted to see the world.  On my way there, I met a dwarf on the boat and we got to talking for a while.  He told me I really needed armor (I didn't even have patchwork yet) then proceeded to give me 10PP. OMGOSH!!! I thought I was so rich!  His name was Baltazor or something, and that was truly one of the first nice things anyone had ever done for me.<br>
<br>
Running through east commons an hour or so later, I thought - hey, animals love druids!  So when I saw a lion as I neared the third inn, I thought, what a nice kitty!  My feelings changed shortly there after as he ate me.  <br>
<br>
Returning to the zone, I was so lost, didn't know how to do /loc and had no idea where I had died.  I received a /t from a necromancer who was standing over my corpse.  He guided me there, and watched over me as I looted my paltry belongings.  <br>
<br>
I asked him what I owed him -- and he said nothing but my respect.  I told him he had my respect, but he also had my friendship.  We became good friends for a very long time.  Thaumiel -- you will always be in my heart.  Leaving Karana server was so hard because I left you behind.<br>
<br>
I also remember my first time through West Karana.  I was all of level 19 and wanted to see Qeynos.  I ran through NK to the zone line, and a friend told me once I hit WK, it would be all smooth sailing from there, as nothing in WK would touch me.  So... I go running happily through the center of WK right into... the ogre camp!  Ouch. Died so fast I didn't know what hit me.  I was so devastated as I had died right at the edge of the camp.:(  Each time I tried to get to my corpse I was killed again. <br>
<br>
Now.. rawhide armor was pretty important to me then, and I was very upset. However, this druid happened to be running by.  His name was Iuvdar and some how or other, he managed to get my corpse for me.  THANK YOU, once again, for your kindness.  *HUG*<br>
<br>

Everyone started in Queynos. The evil race trainers were outside the city walls. Back when Black Burrow was nasty and I remember losing a character or two down there because none of us new it well enough to find the bottom. heheh... Then when the character wipes of the betas yopu would stand in a VIRTUAL line to talk to a GM about getting reimbursed plat per level you attained in the previous beta.. The virtual lines were long and people always tried to cut in.. It was back when a bone bladed claymore was UBER hehe. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uedeina.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Edeina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Board Mistress</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/19/02 1:35:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2807.topic&index=55>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.one.se/users/chribesk/edeina.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Your first EQ memories</span><hr size=1> I will move this thread to the Nuggets section in a while.<br>

<br>
First journey to FV with some friends, to get Radlarri his breeze spell... was like a story written by Agaitha Cristie... we started in FP and when we passed the sister island, one in the group got stranded on the bridge, where she got killed by a cyclops, when zoning from BB to OT, the cleric in the group fell in the water and swam around for a long time, before she remembered she had gate, lol. In FV Rad got his spell, and then he had to try it out, so Borur (pally) and him where casting spells while we waited for the boat to come back... the guards killed B after he tryed to cast blind on Rad... dont think I'll ever forget that trip...<br>
<br>
First journey back to Karanas, we (same group that went to FV btw (or &quot;tried&quot; to)) went over Lake Rathe, and dident know how to cross the ocean, Borur managed to steer the little boat at the docks, and we went off out to the lake... just one small problem... he couldent get the boat to steer straight, so we went in small circles all the way across... <p><center>

I drowned in the river and started over, because I was in this strange place called Misty Thicket <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Creating Pitts, handing my note to the Priest of Discord. I fell in the river a second time and spawned in Misty. I remember seeing those big tall Elves hanging around the Rivervale entrance. <br>
<br>
My RL friend finally got on and I sent her a tell. I had to start Pitts over since I lost my note, and she gave me a full set of leather and a Fine Steel Dagger (I think, I dont remember). <br>
<br>
Hunting in Misty Thicket and getting killed by a moss snake because I didnt know how auto attack worked. <br>
<br>
Man I just cant explain the feeling of it, the game just seemed so mystical and enchanting when I was at a lower level. <br>
<br>
Edit: Also, Glimdore or Karden if your out there, thanks for grouping with me in Nro, you guys taught me much <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I made a half-elf druid, and when I logged on, all I could see for the first day was her butt in a thong (I didn't know how to change views), and when I asked my friends on how to change it, they just laughed, guess they wanted me to run around looking at my characters butt all day <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Iuvdar is one of the few treasures that I have found on EQ, I was lucky enough to have met him at a lower level, (if my memory serves me correctly it was in unrest on his other character) and have hunted with him ever since.  Over the years I have seen him help and assist many players, was nice to see someone remember him <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><b><font color="#00FFFF">Squishem<br>

<br>
The very first time I created a character.Read the manual?Ha!I got in,ran around and sat down.Never did figure out that night how to stand back up and logged out.<br>
<br>
The first time I "twinked" a char.I found a small room,dropped my bags and money,logged out and logged in my other char hoping noone found my stash.I was so scared someone would take my few pp and bags of food,batwings,and leather armor. <p><center><font face="Chaucer" size="5" color="Magenta4">Zoritsa Nepenthe</font></center>
