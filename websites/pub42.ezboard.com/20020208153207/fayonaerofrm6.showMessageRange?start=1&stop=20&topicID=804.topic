Reason being most of the members are &quot;out for themselves&quot; and I was tired of trying to help everyone do their epics, kill thier mobs then get ignored when asking for a port somewhere or do something that doesnt benefit the porter in some way.Also, almost everyone in tides of valor are immature Greedy children, playing their game. I can understand that but i just didnt want to be around that any longer.<br><br>Soon as I leave after heated arguments in guildchat (everyday thing) The tells Come a flyin... I get rude tells such as &quot;YOU LEFT AFTER GETTING ALL OUR LOOT YOU FUCKER&quot; and shit like that. I explain to the ones that gave me such tells that i did not want to leave.. .and it wasnt my plan to take your shit and leave, it just happned that way after i realized what a mistake Tides were. Constant tells about full warlords this full warlords that. <br><br>Tides got me 3 pieces of warlords arms, legs and bp. The arms i rolled on... the legs i was awarded for camping ragefire For 4 of our clerics(it droped while i was in rage camp and MQed it later) The bp i tried to turn down... since i  had berserkers bUT ullric, one of the officers insisted I loot it. so i did.<br><br>I tell the ones i cared about in tides good bye and good luck ( yes there are few tides that are actually very nice) and they wish me the same. Im thinking, whew... finally i got out of that heap of shit. <br><br>This morning... A necro in tides of valor Asks me if he can Dupe the cloak of flame i had gotten in tides before the patch... I mean jeez... im a troll but im not that stupid. If you really wanted it that bad, Just have faranor ask for it i was thinking.<br><br>Later this morning... Poldar, Faranors twin brother Asks me to give the cof back. I told him to have faranor give me a tell. So he does. He says give the cof back... Although i felt as if i earned it considering i was there when they got their cloaks of piety, I agreed to give th cloak back. And i did. Even though i couldve easily kept it... but id rather not deal with the bullshit that comes with me keeping it... All the retarded rumors... all the hate tells and what not... Id rather just move on and have fun with OTHER people. <br><br>Im not sure what im meaning to do here... Ask a question such as &quot;was this right&quot; or whatever for some support from your folks since i feel so betrayed... OR to just give anyone whos thinking about joining Tides a Decent warning... Well anyhow, Best of luck ToV... Please dont send me anymore tells.../bye<br><br><br>Blizz <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ukodimoo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kodimoo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/10/02 5:27:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=804.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Things you do after leaving a guild...</span><hr size=1> its impossible to leave a guild on good terms<br><br>there is always a few who hate you.. just the way it is. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/utasar01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>tasar01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/10/02 5:53:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=804.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Things you do after leaving a guild...</span><hr size=1>    Not always true , when i left imperial order after a year and a half , I didn`t get any bad tells most wanted to know why i left and wished me good luck .

People argue over who deserved what, and which spoils should have gone to whom.<br><br>Unsurprisingly, Choosing a new guild is a lot like dating, and joining a new guild is unfortunately a lot like a marriage contract.  Getting a piece of phat lewt is a lot like scoring, in this simile, and the attendant bad feelings if the relationship goes sour afterwards.<br><br>If someone gave you a cof, sure, give it back.  If you got it in a raid because it was awarded to you, you should have kept it.<br><br>Here's the thing about phat lewts.  INVARIABLY, I have felt completely silly about all emotional attachment I had to any loot dispute, 1 year after the fact, but the way people act around loot, on the other hand, stays with you forever.  On the other hand, guilds, at their root, even if formed on the basis of friendship and respect, are loot contracts and vehicles for multi group communication.  As in, they are an extended method of the pickup philosophy of &quot;hey, if you win two lottos, be cool and kick one of the items back in so everyone leaves with something, eh?&quot;  With the attendant ability to not have to lotto and stuff.  The key is to find a guild who's loot distribution method you can live with, AND who has a number of on line friends in it and people who you respect.<br><br>This game is PRESENT based, however, Not future based, not past based.  So, loot should clearly be awarded on the &quot;and if he get that he'll lose future arguments about whether he deserves the next piece of loot to someone who didn't get something&quot;.<br><br>Edit: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA sigh...public computers and ezboards don't mix.....<br>This was Maniacles...haven't seen raftik here in a bit...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><font face ="Balloon XBd BT">_______________________<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4782">Raftik</a><br><a href="http://www.casus-belli.net">Casus Belli</a></font></font></font></font></font></font></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uraftik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raftik</A> at: 1/10/02 6:49:27 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/utaunto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Taunto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/10/02 6:56:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=804.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Things you do after leaving a guild...</span><hr size=1> /comfort Blizz <br>It's ok fatty, we can still own seb together <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><B><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6001">Taunto</A></B><br> 56th Gnome Myrmidon.<br><B><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=53347">Ocinel</A></B><br>56th Lizard Master.<br> <A HREF="http://www.ayonae-ro.net">Ayonae-Ro.</A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/upalimaxsceleris.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Palimax Sceleris</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local Resident</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/10/02 6:57:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=804.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Things you do after leaving a guild...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Im not sure what im meaning to do here...

There are items, in Vision, that we ask people leave in the guild.  (Kunark BP/Legs are a good example of this - as are most &quot;near epic&quot; caster items, Velks Spellbook comes to mind.)  When I hand someone an item on a raid that we'd like to keep in-guild, I usually say something along the lines of, &quot;Cleric, if you'd like to wear one of Vision's Donal's BPs until we can get you a better one, I'd like you to use it.&quot;<br><br>I don't do this because I think people didn't earn their items, or because I want people to leave Vision naked.  We keep things like tradable BPs in the guild because it benefits the guild as a whole.<br><br>Allamar, Taygon, Menendi, and Kolthar...  ...like every guild, we've outfitted our main tanks to the teeth.  If Allamar left the guild he'd go with full Skyshrine armor, dragon haste, epics, and the best loose equipment we could put on him.  ...and while I'm sure Allamar would offer back his droppable guild-gained items, I don't think we'd ever ask for them.  Allamar earned every item he has and more for being the most self-less giving person I've ever had the fortune of being guilded with.<br><br>In short, most of the people in our guild who have a &quot;guild&quot; item probably already know what they SHOULD give back if they left; and I hope we've chosen people with the character and backbone TO give them back.  (Because in all honesty, we can't make them...)<br><br>If Tides of Valor deserved the CoF, then you should have given it back.  If you deserved the CoF, then you should have kept it (if you didn't have an agreement beforehand).  And remember, not every agreement is spoken.  If you saw 10 other people get an item and then pass it along or give it up when asked, you can expect the same sort of tacit agreement to bind your behavior too.<br><br>People have left Vision on good terms.  People have left Vision on bad terms.  The number one distinction for seperating the two are generally the people who told us the truth are on the &quot;good terms&quot; list.  Some people just don't &quot;fit&quot; into a guild.  Look at your real circle of friends and co-workers.  That guy you work with, who you don't have lunch with, he's probably not a bad guy, he's probably just not YOUR TYPE of guy.<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> This morning...

Regarding ToV, I dont think y'all should be knocking them.  Granted I am not in them, but I would like to be, provided the chance.  If you had actually just gotten the CoF &quot;Before the patch&quot; as in, recently, just before leaving, I think given context it might be &quot;fair&quot;.<br><br>I mean, when I was in (Guild A), I was removed after a blowup when I said they had no balls, then turned off guildchat and went on anon.  I then left (Guild B) after I finally got an offer from a better one. <br><br>In the case of Guild A, they would have had no right to ask for anything back.  I had earned everything that I got and I did not plan to leave, nor sucker them into getting me &quot;Fat Loot&quot; with the sole intention of leaving after I got my fill.  In the case of Guild B, had I taken anything from them, they might have been justified.  Because I deliberately stayed with them when I had plans to leave.<br><br>No, I have never taken anything from a guild and then just left right after I got what I wanted.  But if you had done this (And I stress this, I am NOT saying that you did) then the guild has every right to ask for it back, IMHO, because you deceived them.<br><br>I think this is one of those cases where the wrong and right of the situation can only be discerned by examining the circumstances sorrounding the incident.<br><br>&lt;On a side note, IMHO, a lot of people in Tides are great people, Faranor included.  I have a great deal of friends in it and I wish I could join them.  So it would be taken as a personal favor if the Tides flaming could end.&gt; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uullric.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ullric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/11/02 2:10:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=804.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Oh</span><hr size=1> Having just gotten off work, I am just now learning of this.<br><br>I talked to Blizz after he left, and my opinion then was that he should keep all the items he had (not only the CoF, but some Crescent Blades), as I felt he had earned them.<br><br>More than not, I believe if someone contributes enough, they deserve what they leave a guild with.

Such &quot;users&quot; I have no sympathy for.<br>At times, I've held grudges of people leaving and I understood, depending on the case. What I absolutely can't stand however, is people leaving without any single word or reason to *anyone* in the guild until pushed and asked. If someone leaves, I would like to know the reason. I don't like people to leave in most cases. I don't like BS excuses for it either. Or people who only join to have something and some shot at some loot until high enough for a high end guild as previously mentioned. No sympathy for any such people.<br><br>But I'm drifting to a whole different topic there. I'll shut up. Take it easy, if all you were gettin out of logging in was stress..then its time to relax.
