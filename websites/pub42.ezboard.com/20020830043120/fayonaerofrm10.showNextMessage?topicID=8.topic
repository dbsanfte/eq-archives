Paladins</span><hr size=1> Ok, I'm leaving a serious post here. It is about how I role-play a Paladin. See, a very large number of people tend to believe that Paladins should be kind to everyone and give every race a chance (this is about Rping). I myself have no problem with kindness, but I do have certain reservations  on how people view they should be.<br><br>It was a few weeks ago when someone said that a Paladin would not act out of rage and was kind hearted. According to fantasy genre, a Paladin is a holy knight; a warrior that represents his beliefs and adheres to a code that goes along with it. It was when I stated that I felt that Paladins should be fanatic that I was told that it was wrong to think that way about them.<br><br>On to the subject at hand. The three major classes in Europe were the Knight Templars, the Knight Hospitalers and the Knight Tuetonic. These were the three holy classes of knights that would best represent the manner in which an Everquest Paladin is based; a holy, quest knight. Now, of these three classes it would be best to assume that the knight hospitaler is the best representation: &quot;a charitable group which cared for the sick and weary pilgrims in the Hospital of St John…&quot;, &quot;built a fortress for the Grand Master and a large hospital for the sick&quot;,  (KNIGHTS, Andrea Hopkins). The Hospitalers were described as clerical knights who built hospitals and also castles.<br><br>Along with the Tuetons, they became one of the most powerful classes of knights during all three of the crusades. My discussion is pointing to the crusades. It was  fanatical quest to convert Muslims to Christianity over a period of several years. These cleric/knights were mass murderers even though they cared for the sick and devoted themselves to their religion and their healing.<br><br>So it would not be unfair to label Donnely McLeod as a loud, fanatical, raving lunatic in the pursuit of the Honor issued from his deity (Mithaniel Marr). Also on a side note. Paladin was just a rank. It denoted a high step in rank; Squire-Knight-Cavalier-Paladin (lancer isn't a rank, I don’t care what anyone thinks about it. It was a profession). So, the fact that I am rude to Dark Elves when I role-play doesn't reflect any attitude I have in RL. <br><br>Also, a lot of people automatically like people of their own class. But Donnely does not like high elves. Just a human, slightly prejudice side that he dislikes about himself. He believes that they are the 'gentlemanly' Paladins that don’t have a warrior spirit (these are the thought not of me, but of Donn. Some people are just that way). He likes Dwarven Paladins and is slightly indifferent to Half-Elves.<br><br>I even have a personal history written about Donnely, just so I can make him a deeper character then most people; just being a Paladin isn't enough.<br><br>Well, any opinions for or against would be greatly appreciated. <br> <p>"Bleating and babbling I fell on his neck with a scream.Wave upon wave of demented avengersMarch cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream."--Pink Floyd"The probability of life originating from accident is comparable to the probability of the unabridged dictionary resulting from an explosion in a printing shop."---Biochemist George Wald."All you need is love, love Love is all you need"--The BeatlesDonnely McLeodPaladin of Mithaniel Marr40th Knight of Mithaniel MarrVictoire dans la mort; La mort avant reddition!</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uelviscerat0r.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elviscerat0r</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/23/00 7:16:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Roleplaying your Knight...
