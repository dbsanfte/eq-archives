"I am willing to bet I have some "User" friends that contribute more to each of these areas than you do."<br>

Doubt it, as soon as you said identified them as drug users that puts them in the waste of space category.<br>
<br>
"I Bet you make half the money and contribute half the tax dollars that some of my friend do. "<br>
<br>
Again, another nitwit thinks that paying taxes makes up for drug use.<br>
<br>
Besides, drug dealers don't pay taxes on the poison they sell to kids.  Yeah, that's right, your friends likely deal drugs in one form or another if they are using them.<br>

There is no such thing as "occasional" drug use.  Once you start down that path, you eventually fuck up and land yourself in hot water.<br>

- I am now completely convinced that Wayfarer = Dreadnok.<br>
You want to know what the real waste of space in this world is? Apart from Star Trek? People who NEED to elevate themselves, whether it be on intelligence, intellect, morale, opinion or general belief. People who HAVE TO - for their life depends on it - state themselves as Head and Shoulders (tm) above the rest so that they can shine.<br>
Ignorance is not bliss.<br>
The dumb, the dim, the stupid, the slow people, they all can voice opinions too. You really do not need a PhD to be allowed. Look at the instruction manual on How To Be An American Citizen (the white/middle class version. I think it's V1.0). Check under the chapter noted Freedom of Speech and Speach.<br>
Not everyone is your stepping stone or blanket covering the dirt.<br>

 As far as native americans go,I am 1/4 Cherokee and I can tell you that yes,they do use mind altering substances(ie Marijuana,peyote etc.)in rituals and religious ceramonies.However,if you call one a pothead,he will probably punch you in the nose.They are very proud people and they dont use to get all f'ed up.Its a part of there culture not for recreation <p>   <font color= ffoooo>Selwen SoulGazer</font >

<br>
No. Not from you anyway.<br>
I might want to hear it from someone who still has some credibility – but not from you.<br>
<br>
Not from someone who has cheerfully admitted to doctoring source material, misquoting, and lying to support his arguments.<br>
Someone who when caught - clearly said they were not sorry, said that they did it all the time, and indicated that they would likely not stop doing it.<br>
<br>
Not from someone who proudly brags about being a below average student in a university where the professors spout off incorrect “facts”.<br>
<br>
Not from someone who said America deserved what happened to it on September 11th – and that the people who did those attacks had “reasons” for them.<br>
You can deny having said it now – but one of the problems with being an admitted liar is that people are less inclined to believe you even when you swear that <I>this time</I> you are telling the truth.<br>

Thank your diety for my gracious attention to your unworthiness.<br>
<br>
1. I am <b>not</b> a liar.<br>
<br>
Unlike Halo - I have not been caught lying, misquoting, and falsifying source material. I did not then gleefully admit to doing the same, nor did I then remain unapologetic for my actions - indicating that I would continue doing them.<br>
<br>
Halo has done all of these things - still refusing to admit that any of it was wrong.<br>
<br>
As such his credibility was judged to be nonexistant by numerous reasonable people on this very board.<br>
<br>
2. Does saying someone is on /ignore qualify as a lie?<br>
<br>
First - there is no /ignore on this board, you hopeless cretin. It's called "sarcasm" - have someone look it up and read it to you.<br>
<br>
Second - I never said Halo was on ignore. I said you were on /ignore (again - "sarcasm") followed by a direct order for you to say hello to him.<br>
<br>
3. Am I to take it you agree with Halo that the deaths of September 11th were justified?<br>
Perhaps some of the people who died had used a drug once - and so they all "had it coming to them"?<br>
<br>
4. Basically, I try to ignore you - except when I want a little fun kicking around a mentally challenged fascist.<br>
<br>
5. One quick question from another thread you shit your stupidity all over:<br>
<br>
<blockquote type=cite><blockquote><hr>"Who cares?<br>
<br>
USA > Mexico<br>
<br>
~Dart"<hr></blockquote></blockquote><br>
<br>
Does this mean all of the people of Mexico are "wastes of space" as well?<br>
<br>
I command you to reply.<br>

I believe the word you are looking for is Ambition.  And I for one am a very motivated person.  <br>
<br>
Oh no.  Ouch, you like hurt me with them words or something.  What did I quit...let's see:<br>
<br>
1) Arguing on a messageboard with a faceless dumbass whom seems to think the world is at his fingertips to do with as he pleases.<br>
<br>
2) Everything has been covered already.  I do not wish to sit here and reiterate and hash everything quote by quote.  Its just personal attacks now anyways.  Ever since you entered the scene with your Nazi antics and non negotiable personality.<br>
<br>
3) I dont fucking care.  I could care less if people smoke.  I could care less if it was legal or not.  I do what I want, others do what they want.  It's a shameless stereotype that seems to be stamped on your bean-sized, impressionable baby mind.  <br>
<br>
4) I find it amusing reading your &quot;I got a big dick&quot; posts.  You seem to believe that you are belittling the stoner community, when in fact, you give us a scapegoat to to beat on.<br>
<br>
5)  I don't fucking care...I said this already?  Oh must be my lack of short term memory showing through.  <br>
<br>
In closing I have some directions for Dart.<br>
<br>
A) Find a road.<br>
B) Throw yourself into traffic. <p><p align="center">

Dart, your ignorance to this issue is obvious.  My guess is you've experienced substance abuse in the family, and have devoted your life to the campaign of DARE, and preaching your simple minded beliefs.  Mind you I don't condone the use of coke, or heroine.. but marijuana is harmless when used in a controlled environment.  It has no more physical damaging effects than tobacco.  The closest I've come to damaging myself while stoned was when I decided to cross a busy street and came a cun.. err nose hair away from being road kill.. lesson learned.  The fact that you believe anyone who uses illegal drugs can't contribute to society, and should be pelted with stones and locked in prison is absolutely ludicrous.  Remember your words everytime you turn on your computer.. cause it is very possible it was designed by a friend of my family who works for IBM, and also smokes ganja to relax the mind.  If I'm at a party and it gets too crowded and decide to go out back to smoke a bowl with some friends and mistake the stars for gods salt, and fear he is preparing to eat us, is my choice.  I'm young, and enjoy it.  Certainly not going to quit cause you believe it's 'stupid'.  I'll just wait till you hit 30, and look back at life and realize all the things you missed out on in your youth.  Then when you take your own life in mass depression, we'll be sure to fill your waste of space <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Do you have any idea how hard it must be for him?<br>
<br>
Working the drive-thru window day after day, getting yelled at by his nineteen year old manager for screwing up people's orders, and all day long forced to serve people he considers "wastes of space".<br>
<br>
Here he is, playing by societies rules, obeying all the laws - and yet those "damn potheads" make more money than him, drive better cars, lead happier lives, have more friends, are actually liked by people...damn - it must really frustrate the hell out of him.<br>
<br>
All of his life he has been hated by all the “popular” people that he wanted so bad to be his friends. He could never fit in with anyone – and every time he tried they all just laughed at him. <br>
Is it any wonder he wants to see everyone who isn’t just like him either gone from the world, or locked away in prisons? <br>
<br>
Things have been going steadily down hill for him since the time he got that little gold star sticker, from Officer Friendly at his Elementary School’s DARE presentation, for successfully memorizing all the tell-tale signs of Drug Addiction. <br>
That was the proudest moment of his life. He still keeps the little foil star in his wallet…next to the condom that has been faithfully waiting for service for 15 years now.<br>
He just can’t understand why women aren’t more impressed by his singular accomplishment. Don’t they realize how long it took him to memorize that DARE pamphlet?<br>
<br>
His only solace is coming home to his Radio Shack Color Computer, logging onto this board over his free 1000 AOL hours, and playing dominant male fascist. <br>
It's the only time in his life he gets to be in charge - protected by the boards anonymity - he doesn't have to worry about getting his ass kicked everyday...like he did all through High School (until he dropped out earlier and traded his ten speed to someone so they would help him cheat on the GED).<br>
<br>
Imagine what it must be like to fall asleep every night, curled into a fetal position, quivering with rage at the injustice of the world, and waiting patiently for the day when he will finally have saved enough pennies for a used gun – so he can show all those bastards that he is a <I>real</I> man! <br>
<br>
“Then they will pay!” he shouts, “I’ll make all those wastes of space pay!”<br>
