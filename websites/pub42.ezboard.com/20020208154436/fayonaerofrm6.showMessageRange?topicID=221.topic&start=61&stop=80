<br>
Usually it takes me no more than 2 minutes. My usually tactic to get binds is to shout that I'm offering plat for a bind and giving out free samples of sow at whatever location I'm at. People wanting sow will swarm around and one of them will give me a bind, usually free and many times from druids who were happy that nobody was going to be bugging them for sow.<br>
<br>
However, it L55 - I'm going to want a rez if I die so rarely bother changing my bind point.<br>

<br>
If I just want a port I do a /who wiz, or /who druid and give a direct tell and ask them if they have the time would they mind teleporting me to x location for 50pp, and if they are busy just say so no worries.. and if they say no I ALWAYS say Thanks anyway good hunting to you. I used to feel that it was kind of rude to give a direct tell for a port to a druid wizzie, but now I feel if they dont want to be bombarded with tells for ports they will exercise the /role /anon functions in the game.<br>
<br>
My prefered method of getting a teleport if I have time is to simply wait for that druid/wizzie /auctioning porting to any location for donations. When I take a ride from these ppl I quickly sum up there Twink status and make a donation according to what state of riches I feel they have. If its a person well dressed and obviously just trying to make a few extra pp I donate 30 pp, if its a Translocate from that type of person I donate 30pp. if its a lvl 29-40ish druid/wizzie that is obviously hoping to make what ever they can cause they need the cash I generally donate 50-100pp depending on what state of pocket cash I have atm.<br>
<br>
I have a wizard alt. and he has never taken any donations what so ever to port people. And now that Translocate is out I will even answer FAR more of the /ooc /auc I see for people asking for Teleports.<br>
<br>
Clerics on the other hand I feel totally different about. Anyone who has any clue what so ever about what the cost is to simply exist as a post 50 cleric would ALWAYS donate I believe. I have had many clerics say to me dont worry about donating (usually the clicker clerics) and I have always asked them to please look at my donation as a stack of 10 peridots, not as 150 pp. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/usandin54.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sandin54</A> at: 12/22/01 11:21:24 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uschande.showPublicProfile?language=EN>schande</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/23/01 12:41:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=221.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Always pay for TP and ress?</span><hr size=1> imo these pps for a 49 or 56 rez are a laugh compared to the time you'd unrezzed spend to regain same state of exp back when lvl 50+, so i always pay well of course.<br>

Since my cleric alt was 56+ the request for rezzes increased alot. I usually only rez friends, since I am tired of those rez beggers, that expect! you to rez.<br>
<br>
If people ask polite and are close by I rez for free, if not I just say no, have no time. And you know what? People bitch at me for saying no.<br>
<br>
I ask friends or players ingame nice for TP or rez and they usually grant them, if they have time. If not, thats life, but I am not paying.<br>
<br>
About charging, as a cleric I charge my group for symbols. If someone doesn't want to he can leave the group. Yes, I use the power a cleric has for this or leave the group myself.<br>
<br>
You want a service? Pay for it. If you can live without it, don't pay. Easy, welcome to the basic economy.<br>

Then I start sending tells /tell kewlweezord Hail, would you be willing to TP me from Gfay to CS for 60pp please?  I almost never have a problem getting a port with this request. I find that sending a tell rather than shouting or auctioning is way more effective.  If they say no then fine, I just thank them for their time and move on to the next on the list that isnt in a hunting/raiding zone.  As for resses I rarely even ask the cleric to CR me or go to a different zone.  If Im in seb or Velks and I die, I'll have someone drag me to a cleric for a res.  I typically dont offer pp for resses unless it's an inconvienance to the cleric, and I do everything within my power to make it convienant.  I have however paid 1K for a res once. and more than 500pp on a few other occasions.  These occasions being like when I died in Permafrost from LD.<br>
<br>
I dont however understand these cleric horror story's.  When I used to play my wizard as my main and people asked me for ports I simply said not right now Im busy if I was.  I had people actually ask me for ports from OOT, or Eruds Xing while I was in WK or something, responding with a no wasnt that hard.  Someone who cant understand why I would refuse such a request to a total stranger is someone I wouldnt be willing to help anyway.  Why a cleric would even consider ressing someone who was not in the same zone as them without considerable compensation is beyond me.  So I guess if you go around travelling 3 zones to ress people and things dont go great and you dont get paid then there's noone to blaim but yourselves.  Learn how to say no. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ukinid.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kinid</A> at: 12/23/01 5:36:57 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ukhandysweetsoul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Khandy Sweetsoul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/23/01 2:28:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=221.topic&index=68>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: in my case....</span><hr size=1> Taino, I disagree with the fact that you shouldnt be paying for the &quot;downtime&quot; of a rez.  <br>
<br>
Lets say im in a group and someone needs a rez.. I will ask my group if they mind if I rez someone.. why? cause yes its downtime for me AND them.  They have to hold pulls etc..   And when in a group, rarely clerics are FM.. so chances are that after the rez, healing that person and buffing them a little.. you will most likely be OOM and have to med before starting pulls again.  And yes.. I will split with the group the donation I got.<br>
<br>
Exemple, I rezzed a whole group of you guild yesterday in Towers, my group had just came up on 6th floor and we had med to full down on 5th so that we are ready to pull once up there.  So initialy.. we would of went up and started pulls right away.. but I rezzed 5 persons at entrance.  That caused 20 min of downtime.  Rezzed them, healed them and buffed them.  The mage with us even used all her mana on summoning rods so I could rez them all as quickly as I could cause I know how annoying it can be waiting for a rez.  So I was out of mana, mage oom, my groups buff fading.. its a question of getting ready all over again for pulls.  They all donated.  In normal situation, if im doing nothing and have the time and the mana for it, I WILL refuse donations, but when it takes some time out of my playing, grouping and downtime on all my group.. donations are welcome.<br>
<br>
So all this to say that yes.. sometimes the cleric will accept the donations for the &quot;downtime&quot; it causes him/her and the group.<br>
<br>
Also like others said.. most ppl do offer /shout for rezzs and TP's with a donation.. cause they know most of the time they will get the service fast.  The other day my whole group needed a corpse summon... I just did a /who all nec  and asked one if he would be willing to do 4 summon corpses for 500pp and cost of coffins... he said he was on his way... do you think if we would have shouted &quot;Looking for 4 summon corpse at XX zone&quot; we would of had an immediat response?  I doubt it.<br>
<br>
Why offer him 500pp?  Because of his downtime.  Time to get to us, mana spent for 4 cast of summon corpses, time to go back to what he was doing.<br>
<br>
You will never catch me sitting in a zone shouting &quot;rezzing at zone for donations&quot;.. why? Cause if im sitting at zone waiting to rez ppl.. then its not downtime.. and im actualy OFFERING ppl to rez.  <br>
<br>
Often when im running to somewhere and I see a corpse.. I check if that person is online and without notice I cast rez on the corpse and continue my journey.  Then get a tell from that person asking where I am so he can donate.. I tell him its fine and to have a good day... cause he didnt ask, didnt cause me any downtime and maybe made his day.<br>
<br>
So.. I think yes.. most of the time.. donations are for downtimes when the cleric accepts the donation.<br>
<br>
Just my 2cents..<br>

It's all personal opinion if you ask me.<br>
<br>
Just recently I had gotten killed by a game bug and searched and searched for a cleric.. sent a tell to one 3 zones away and asked politely for a rez.. the wonderful heavenly cleric travelled 3 zones and I had not offered her a single cp, but she came, rezzed, and I gave her the 91pp I had on my corpse. That's kindness if you ask me... I believe her name was Aioli.. a cleric of Landslide... a real sweety. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/utheperfectflaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ThePerfectFlaw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/24/01 1:22:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=221.topic&index=74>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.theperfectflaw.com/picture/jolly.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Always pay for TP and ress?</span><hr size=1> You refused to rez me even after I've TL'd/ported half of VV around before.  8( <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=35824><img src=http://www.theperfectflaw.com/picture/profile.jpg></a><br>

introduction of luclin, travel time can be cut down considerably with creative nexus usage), that I rarely use port services.  But on the rare occasion that I have needed <br>
one (to help guild party post-wipeout, etc), I just put a shout out and, once I get a response, ask if 20-30pp is okay.  If I don't get a response, I just keep on moving, and try again in the next zone.  Few things irritate me more than folks standing about for 30 minutes + shouting for a TP to a locale a few zones away, when if they'd just been willing to use their feet they could have already been there....  <br>
<br>
It seems that is is only common courtesy to offer the druid/wiz something for their trouble; after all, it is their time and mana.  I *don't* shout out with a cash offer; as someone said above, if someone is busy, they're busy, and I'd just as soon not bother them. (and, if they're *only* in it for the money, I'd just as soon not use their services)<br>
<br>
As far as rezzes go, I *always* offer to pay the cleric for these.  A rez takes a lot more out of the cleric and his party's time under most circumstances than a port, and most likely at the time you need one, there aren't very many clerics standing around with nothing better to do.  I also always offer to drag the corpse to the cleric, if possible, than ask him to come to it.  Many clerics are perpetually 'in the hole' anyway due to using symbol, etc (over 50% of Faervas' and my income right now (L 47) currently goes to keeping us in rune/symbol gems), which they are expected to do, so I think of 100pp or so as an appropriate donation for a 49+ rez, less for a 39...  if he's in the party, of course, the rezzes are gratis; this is for 'request' rezzes...  <br>
<br>
I am neither a druid, wizard, or cleric, so I am not one to talk in these matters, but I do think it is nice to do 'pro bono' work every once in a while, helping out lower level characters in these matters, I usually slap clarity/augmentation on lowbies I see when passing through the oasis/town gates, etc.<br>

<br>
If i am in a group I generally ask the group members if it is ok that I rez someone who needs it and I split any donation with everyone in the party (as me rezing is infringing on their gaming time as well as mine if I am the primary healer). <br>
<br>
Guildies and friends always get free rezes, of course.<br>
<br>
I think it generally comes down to a combination of courtesy and time.  People want rezes and TPs to save their time (understandable), unfortunatly this usually costs another player time (for travel, mana recovery, etc).<br>
<br>
I personally always donate for rezes and TPs when not asking guildies. To me it just seems courteous to repay people for their effort and time (PP is just one method of this,  kind words, buffs and othersuch work as well, but nothing seems as appreciated as the almighty dollar, so  I make sure to include PP as well as the others) <p><img src="http://www.calamity.net/kfw/upload_repository/baynesig2c.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uclanmcstump.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ClanMcStump</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elite Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/26/01 5:07:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=221.topic&index=78>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Always pay for TP and ress?</span><hr size=1> Regardless of whether I am in a hurry or not, I pay 100p for a Teleport.

<br>
As for rezes... well, i'm a level 60 Cleric (non-epic) who has never been /anon or /roleplay.  If I am able, i will (and have) crossed the entire world to rez someone i dont know for absolutely nothing.  I dont (usually) charge for rezes and I rarely accept donations.  <br>
<br>
If I'm charging you for a rez, most likely its because i dont particularly like you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I dont recall who said they did this, but its something else I like to do... drive by rezes... When i'm running to somewhere and i see a  corpse, i will usually take the time to send a tell to that person asking if they would like their corpse rezed.  If yes, I rez and hang around long enough to drop a heal on em.<br>
