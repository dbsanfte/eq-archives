But you aren't a player anymore.  Don't know why your people decided to stop pushing hard and kicking ass, probably fell into the socialist trap that so many free countries have fallen into.<br>
<br>
If England didn't send her troops, we would still get the job done.  <br>
<br>
England (at least) has the distinction of kicking lots of ass with very little in the past, but that doesn't count for much when it comes to getting things done right now.<br>
<br>
You are an ally because you are a free country, not because we rely on your military might to keep the Huns at bay.<br>
<br>
But I probably wouldn't call England a pissant country for fear that some olde timer Brit would kick my ass into next week.  But when the olde timers die off, I'll have nothing to worry about :P<br>
<br>
I look at Europe and see a bunch of assholes who spent the last 10,000 years fighting over horseshit.  While America has been building the country of the future, Europe has been sitting around whining like babies.<br>
<br>
Here is an example for you:  I work for a company that has  a European branch, and an Australian branch.  In my business there are times when you have to put your head down, ass up and work until the problems are solved.  Doesn't happen that often if you pay attention and make sure to head problems off in a timely fashion, but it does happen.  <br>
<br>
Alright, so the US branch gets in there and solves problems, need to work a weekend?  Ok, lets order pizza and kick ass!  Both the Aussie and European branch are lazy fucks who hit the door a 5 PM, 4 PM if they can get away with it.  <br>
<br>
It isn't just my company either, I talk with guys in other companies who end up having to work with people in Australia and Europe and it is the same.  They have NO work ethic whatsoever; an excuse is just as good as a result.  <br>
<br>
No fucking wonder America is better off, we are willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done.<br>
<br>
I don't work with England specifically, so can't comment much on the English work ethic there, maybe all of Europe is fucked up and England is a shining star in a den of lazy assholes.  Don't know, don't really care, England isn't a player anymore.<br>
<br>
P.S.  As for the American General comment, talk is cheap.  It doesn't cost us a thing to build up England as a bunch of badasses.  I bet he wouldn't say the same thing about India or Pakistan, which we should have REAL fears about facing them in a war (nukes). <p><img src = "http://www.concentric.net/~gandalfh/BixieSig.jpg" width = 199 height = 136>

<br>
And, quite frankly, my attitude toward other countries since 9/11 has gotten a LOT more arrogant....<br>
<br>
You have thousands of troops there.  How many do we have there?<br>
<br>
You have 60 members of the SAS behind enemy lines.  How many do we have?<br>
<br>
Whose equipment are you using?  How much war material have you committed to this fight?<br>
<br>
Granted, this isn't your fight.  I personally appreciate your help.   But, as a very arrogant American, let's get a few things straight.  I wasn't going to post, of course, but.....<br>
<br>
Who knows how to run an economy?  England?  England hasn't had real economic growth for over a decade.  Russia?  Enough said.  China?  Nope.  Japan?  A recession that's what, 12 to 14 years old now?  Germany?  Germany was the great European hope, and demanded that the rest of EU meet their economic demands.  Then their economy went into the dumpster.  Singapore/Indonesia?  That's obvious.  South Korea?  Oh, wait, who'd they get their ideas from?<br>
<br>
You can point to Enron, Worldcom, etc., but whose accounting standards are held up as the standard throughout the world?  What would happen in England if British Telecom imploded?  <br>
<br>
Who has established an agricultural system second to none?  If Russia had a CLUE, they could kill us on this one.  Do you realize how small a percentage of income US citizens spend on food compared to other countries?<br>
<br>
Who has established a banking system that is stable, can survive almost any problem (S&amp;L scandal, anyone?), and serves as a safe haven for investment from foreigners?  Some thought the euro would provide an alternative.  No one mentions that idea anymore.  <br>
<br>
Who knows transportation?  I don't think people understand what a HUGE impact local/national/global logistics has on an economy.  Or, for that matter, a military....  Can you imagine Russia or maybe even Brazil with a real economy and a road/rail system that worked?<br>
<br>
Who innovates?  And let's keep something in mind here - who innovates WITHOUT government support?  <br>
<br>
Whose companies are truly global in scale?  Can you imagine Airbus without government support?  And can you imagine a world in which US companies were allowed to operate in other countries the way foreign companies are allowed to operate here?  Think about what BP, Northern Telecom, and British Telecom have/could have accomplished here in the last decade.  And sure, people might bring up the Japanese companies like Honda, Toyota, Nissan, and Mazda.  Honda does OK.  Toyota has problems.  Nissan is being turned around by a foreign executive.   Ford owns 25% to 35% of Mazda with the OK of the Japanese government.  <br>
<br>
Yes, I'm arrogant.  But I believe, if you think about it, that we have concrete reasons for believing we're the best.  <br>
<br>
And that's my two copper . <p>Mirdorr, 42 bard, Ayonae Ro

<br>
The whole concept of the special forces came just after the 2nd World War.  It was proposed and devised by David Sterling for the British Army.   Years later the US army along with many other countries was to start their own versions of the SAS/SBS.  They used the SAS as their model and requested techniques and training from the SAS.  <br>
<br>
So it was more like SAS training was incorporated with US army traning and then adjusted for each specialist force. They were however trained by SAS members.  Today its a little different.  we just swap troops, ie, the SAS go to train with the Navy SEALS.... the SEALS train with the SAS...  It's a join traning agreement.<br>
<br>
I hope that cleared things up for you,  i worded it badly due to time restrictions sorry :-)<br>

Its goal is to judge on trials involving several countries, wars and so on. It is done so there is a truly neutral court in the world to take care of such sensitive cases.<br>

Anyways another good post bud,  this is becoming a healthy debate.  You said you don't know why Britain gave up all its power instead of continuing to kick ass.  Well i guess we realised that to be so powerful means being hated.  i mean Britain occupied 2/3rds of the world at its height.  Think how upset countries would be if the US began to invade all over the place and claim their countries as part of their empire.  I guess we just grew up and decided to hand it all back.<br>

The pissant countries of the world are trying to manufacture authority with their "world" court garbage.  Think of it like this, you get 10 brand spanking new guild members next week, they tell you "hey, we want to form a loot council that decides how loot is distributed.  There will be 10 spots on the council, you can have one spot, and we will fill the other 9 with the new members."  <br>
<br>
The world court is the same thing.  A bunch of people who have NO credibility whatsoever in the area of peace or impartial justice want to make a new court that will have absolute authority.  Not only that, but they want to have jurisdiction over the people who DO have credibility in the area of peace and impartial justice.<br>
<br>
Bush's stance is right on.  Make your world court, put some resources into hunting down criminals and hanging them there.  But if we think you are fucking up, we will come in boots first and kick some ass. <p><img src = "http://www.concentric.net/~gandalfh/BixieSig.jpg" width = 199 height = 136>

Think what you will, but unless you're American and exercising your right to vote for the leaders who support your views, your opinion in this matter means exactly 0<br>

The U.S. China, India, and Russia all have refused to ratify the international court that is sanctioned by the UN. The U.S. actually signed the treaty under Clinton, but reversed its stance under Bush. Some of the main supporters of this new international court are Saudi Arabia, Irag, Iran, Libia(sp). All of which have some issues with the U.S. I am not saying it is right or wrong, all I am saying is that the biggest supporters of this court are the United States enemies that would like nothing more then to get their hands on a U.S. citizen to make a political point through a UN sanctioned court so that their country does not have to take responsibility.  <p>Simondavid

Our fighting spirit and knowledge was the exact same as that which was used in Europe. I dont see how you can claim that somehow you have more knowledge when the founders of the US were Europeans. Our knowledge base was the exact same as yours when the US was formed. If anything, we have advanced beyond your knowledge, we started out with everything you knew, and expanded on it.<br>
<br>
As for your dramatic statement about the fate of the world, with all the wars thruout history, very few have had the fate of the world hinged upon them.<br>
<br>
Dont get all pissy about the US. You guys forced us out with your politics, you forced us to become what we are today. Dont get mad because we are a powerhouse while you are fading away. If you had appeased instead of thumbed your nose at your citizens, the US would never have existed.<br>

Just remember, &quot;our american ass&quot; is from the same decendants as your english ass.

It is compulsory for every child 16 or under to visit the dentist once every 6 months... That is the bare minumum.  most visit every couple of months for a general Checkup.  <br>
<br>
In fact alot of english are under the impression that americans have bad teeth, as a direct result of the media portraying the whole &quot;Redneck&quot; persona...ie someone wearing a strawhat with half their teeth missing.  An average English person has no worse teeth than your average American. <br>
<br>
My teeth are perfect... my families teeth are perfect, and no-one i know personally has teeth that are bad.  <br>
