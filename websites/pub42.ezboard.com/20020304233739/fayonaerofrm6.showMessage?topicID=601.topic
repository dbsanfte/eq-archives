When this guy from Prism runs up inspect Scilentt, then tells me that I am too high for that camp I have no reason to be there and that HE was taking over the camp. <br>
<br>
I told him I was there for Faction and DF Belts which got me the reply too bad you are too high for the camp. You don't need faction and judging by your equipment you can buy DF Belts from me when I get them.....Well this guy then starts shouting for more at orc 1. I would normally just leave the camp but I refuse to just let someone come up and tell me to leave a camp that I had been at for 3+ hours.<br>
<br>
Well he slowly builds up his group and tries to pull spawns while I fight other spawns and it got to the point where they were trying to pull all the spawn even if I engaged it first. And having a full group they were KS'ing me about 50% of the time. <br>
<br>
Well, I petition and log in Dayloch to help keep the camp and to stop there KS'ing. Well they bring in 3 more people to help them out-damage Dayloch, so i now have 9 people all fighting Dayloch for orc 1......LOL.<br>
<br>
I do a /who all gm and see that Vamin is on in Befallen, so i /petition and also send him and tell just to let him know that the situation was getting kinda out of hand.(Snicker fighting over an orc camp....)<br>
<br>
Well about 5 minutes later GM-Vamin comes into our camp and ask us what was going on. I explain that Scilentt was here camping the orcs for faction and DF Belts and that the guy from prism had moved into my camp told me I ws too high and told me to leave... I had even /reported when he told me that. The guy from Prism even backed my story.<br>
<br>
Vamin offers to have us share the spawn. Scilentt would pull 1 orc kill it then they would pull 1 orc and kill it ect... Now get this this guy from Prism actually asked the GM to pull for him since there group couldn't single pull and when he found out that the GM wouldn't do it then he decided that, no they didn't want to share the spawn with me.<br>
<br>
Heehee then the GM-Vamin decides that according to Verants policies all camps MUST be shared if anyone contest it, and since neiter of us were budging, he calls in Desilous to try and help with this situation. <br>
<br>
Desilous asked what was going on and the guy from Prism told him I was too high for the camp and that they were taking it. Well he said that if no decision could be reached then we would have to roll on the camp even after the Prism guy said I was there first....<br>
<br>
Needless to say we roll and i got a 16 out of 100 and lost the camp... BUt in the time that it took us to talk with the GM a 31 monk had moved into the camp and he was now claiming the camp... I tell the GM's that the 2 groups needed to roll on the camp again that it was "policy".<br>
<br>
I promptly get told to shut up and move along but not before Desilous decides that my name was against veriant policy and wipes my last name.<br>
<br>
Well by now I was pissed at the GM's so I logged in Jayy on my second CPU and run up to the GM's and tell them I want the camp and I want a roll on it. Desilous tells me we have to share but if they KS me then they will get warned but he would have to witness it. <br>
<br>
Well I sit Jayy down and the first spawn the 31 monk KS's me. I send Desilous a tell letting him know I was being KS'ed and I get the tell back 'Sorry'. So then I ask him if he was planning on watching this and giving them a warning, mind you this was within 30 seconds of him telling me that they would get warned if they KS me. Well he comes back with ' If someone is KS'ing you petition them and someone will be with you as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
I do a /who all GM and find that Desilous is still in the zone. SO i /petition him, sit at the camp and wait. Three hours later I get tired of waiting and log.<br>
<br>
All this over a little faction and a few DF Belts......<br>
<br>
So just to let you guy know next time you are holding a camp be careful verants new rules say there are no camps. Time spent there means nothing. Everything MUST be shared.  <p>Kikris Calahan

If there is a contestant to a spawn they should share, if they can't reach an agreement the GM's try for awhile.<br>
<br>
Usually if they don't share the GM's end up telling both parties to leave and at times issue warnings..<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> You must comply with arbitration for contested spawns.<br>
<br>
There are cases where two or more groups wish to kill the same thing. In these cases, the groups are required to compromise. If an equitable compromise cannot be reached between the players prior to EverQuest Customer Service Staff involvement, the EQCSR will mandate a binding compromise. Refusing to abide by a compromise mandated by an EQCSR will be considered disruption. It is therefore strongly suggested that the groups make every attempt to reach a compromise that they can live with prior to involving an EQCSR, who may mandate a compromise that does not suit you to the extent that a player-devised compromise would.<br>

I had a near similar situation at Derv 3 (Nro) a while ago, after my alt Druid had broke the camp with 'Harmony'.<br>
<br>
Whilst my merry little group (2 others) were about to pull the last, remaining mob another player stormed up to the camp and made a big display that the camp was to be shared.<br>
<br>
No problem, if: <br>
(i) Derv 3 could <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> support</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> more than 1 group - after all, it is a 3 spawn camp<br>
(ii) The tricky situation that said person could <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> only</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> pull mobs from the camp now that I had broken the camp into single mobs i.e when they loaded.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, said player saw common sense, apologised and left.<br>
<br>
The problem is that Verant have to introduce such rules because common sense does not prevail. Whilst thier policy may seem sensible it is an absolute pig's ear in reality i.e. how do you share an agro camp, or a camp where if you cannot single pull, you will agro the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> whole</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> camp - effectively having the whole camp to yourself?<br>

Malse, you are quite right. However, I would say from reading the complaints that people have raised within this forum, that the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> major</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> bone of contention is consistency. If you have a ruleset then you must abide by it at <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> all</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> times.<br>
<br>
Granted, there will be occasions when interpretation will be necessary, but if there is an existing ruleset then it should apply to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> all</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> players at <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> all</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> times. Yeah, people will still grumble but at least there will be consistency. <br>
<br>
Fortunately, I have not had an issue in EQ where common sense and politeness has failed to prevail. Then again, I am quite low level and have yet to experience Evercamp for x object. <br>

However, if you want to assert that camp stealing, in all forms, is wrong, I will agree with you. Taking umbrage to the actions of other players is also a  perfectly acceptable vice, I know I've gone far beyond the bounds of rationality to &quot;get even&quot; with someone for stealing a mob or whatever.<br>
<br>
My objection was to the way in which the flame was made, and who was being flamed. The idiots that attempted to consume the same spawns were wrong, flame them all you want, I'll bring the marshmellows. <br>
<br>
However, the poster is also wrong, first in that he thought a GM would give a shit, second in assuming they would side with him, and third in believing that this would illicit anything but rolled eyes when posted to NAG. If you want to say &quot;taking scarce resources away from people just because you think you deserve it more&quot; is wrong, I ask you how many GMs you think are on at any given time, and how many people had to wait, stuck in a ladder in Upper Guk, because a GM had to listen to this shit instead of doing something useful.<br>
<br>
You can just as easily plink with arrows for faction and buy DF belts as you can solo Orc N. You can't just as easily solo the Myconid King. But what's most impossible is ever returning to the GM, or the other players that had to wait in the petition queue, the time they lost. <p><B> Malse Spybreak </B><br>

<br>
Such behaviour is all too common in newbie zones - real newbies who don't know any better, and unknown &amp; unguilded alts of highlevel players who enjoy taking out their frustrations on random people. But it always amazes me when a guilded char pulls off crap like that.<br>
<br>
Calling the GMs was a misstake indeed. The Play Nice Policy have been in effect for a long time, and it do indeed suck a lot. It's purpouse is to stop guilds from monopolizing spawns forever by taking turns, and to give the GMs a easy way out of conflicts they don't want to deal with. Generally speaking, GMs are there for your benefit as long as your problems are purely technical. For social problems, well, both sides are paying customers, and they would much rather have you hating each other then Verant.<br>
<br>
Next time you have promlems like this, contact the guys guild. Do a &quot;/who all guildname&quot; and ask a random member if any officers are online. Guilds rarely wnat their members to give them bad reputation, and most people listen to their leaders.<br>
<br>
Also, always assume that the people he gather to help him are good people unless you have a strong indication of the opposite. If they are unnice to you it's probably because he have lied to them about the nature of the situation. Politely tell them the truth and they are likely to stop helping him stealing your camp. In a case like this you might even be able to give them a better offer and they will help you instead. <br>
<br>
Finally, I REALLY despise the &quot;you are too high/low level for this camp/zone&quot; mentality. People who think they can tell others where they are allowed to hunt should be spanked until they come to their senses. As long as you don't train people, steal camps or whatever, you can hunt wherever it pleases you. If you die all the time because it's too hard or don't get any xp because it's too easy, hell, that's your own problem.  <p>Love, Edeina<br>

ok, i also think that the other guy was an a-hole and everyone always thinks that the gms are against them, hating them personally... but what would they have to gain from that?? <br>
<br>
oh well, also, df belts are not a good way to level a char, just cause you level up doesn't mean your skills go up (my old Jeopardy, the shaman, was proof of that, fizzling entire mana bars trying to nuke).<br>
