<br>
I can say for certainty though, that I believe Lleauaric, said it the best...<i>"Maybe Im being suckered.. I dont care.. Ill be a fool for a good reason anytime."</i><br>
<br>
I see suicide as being the easy way out. If you want to beat what is making you angry or sad, fight it. Fight it with everything you've got.  Like Kaely said, do you really never want to see your parents again?  Do you really think that suicide is the answer? There are people to talk to. Your parents and those closest to you. Hell, even people here, have offered to sit down and talk with you.  Don't give up.<br>
<br>
Secondly, suicide is not something to joke about.  A friend of mine, back when I was in high school, we all thought he was joking and just wanted us to pay attention to him. Guess what...he wasn't kidding. Rest in peace, Steven.<br>
<br>
So please, think about the horrible consequences of suicide.  And realize that there are truly people in this world, that DO care about you and your life.  May not show here, obviously, but trust me, there are people that care. <br>

I think the topic IS a joke.  Regardless of whether or not TenHo actually tried to kill himself, coming here and posting what he was doing and then dicking around on the boards for another few hours is comical.<br>
<br>
Also, I take anyone who says they want to kill themselves rather lightly.  I've had a great deal of experience with suicide and suicide attempts and this is what I've learned:  people who talk about killing themselves will often &quot;try&quot;, but the attempt is declared beforehand and then done in a place where someone is very likely to find them and &quot;stop&quot; them in their attempt.  On the other hand, people who are obviously suffering from a depression but rarely talk about killing themselves are much more likely to just do it.  There is little warning if you arent watching carefully for tell-tale signs and even if you ARE watching you are bound to miss something.<br>
<br>
As an example, let me tell you about a woman who was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for clinical depression.  She was there for about 2 weeks.  Throughout her stay she showed signs of improvement:  she attended groups, was sociable and friendly to patients and staff, was often seen telling and laughing at jokes, she slept well, spoke freely with her psychiatrist and therapist, and she was taking all the medication her doctor had assigned her.  After two weeks she made a follow-up appointment with her doctor and was discharged.  <br>
<br>
That same woman killed herself three hours later in a hotel not one block from the hospital.<br>
<br>
Its always the quiet ones I kept a close eye on when I worked at the hospital.  And after that woman, I always kept a closer eye on the ones who seemed to improve quickly.<br>
<br>
The ones who bragged about what they had tried, or the ones who were constantly talking about it I watched because it was my job... but not one of those people successfully killed themselves in the time I worked there.<br>
<br>
Stymp McStump<br>
<br>
Post Script:  I thought I should add for clarification.  I dont want to come across as not caring if TenHo (or anyone for that matter) is feeling depressed.  I have personal experience with depression and I understand that when you're feeling like that all you really want to do is just stop hurting.  And how you get the hurt to stop is much less important than the hurt stopping.<br>
<br>
If you are feeling depressed, thinking excessively about death, or considering killing yourself (or others) I strongly suggest you go speak with your parents, spouse, boy/girlfriend, or someone else very close to you and let them know how you are feeling.  <br>

If you feel like killing yourself, please, no matter how hard it may seem, talk to your famiy, talk to a councelor, talk to a priest, talk to anyone you trust and tell them the truth about how you feel; so they can help you to make changes that make you feel like living.<br>

I've known more people who wanted attention so they took pills, cut themselves, or took any number of other actions to damage themselves physically and get that attention.  That doesn't make the problems of these people less deserving of attention, but it does make them much less of an actual suicide risk.<br>

One of my best friends dumped her boyfriend slightly less then two months ago. We was wasn't much of friends when she dumped him, but we had been long before and are again now. We finally lost contact over a year ago because he was the paranoid type, and it got too irritating to have contact with her with him poking around at all times. Poisoning her relationships with everyone else but him wasn't the worst thing he did, it's good she got rid of him at last. <br>
<br>
Anyway, she can't drop contact with him because they have a son together, and he want her back. He have threathened with suicide many times now, and it will not supprise me if he soon make a fake suicide attempt, or even a real one. Perhaps he allready did. He was supposed to pick up their son the evening before new years eve, but he did not, and he have been gone since. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

About the fact that ppl who talk about suicide themself (i guess that was real bad english now) only try it etc. Last Year the ex-Boyfriend of my older Sister went home after a Party, drank a lot of alcohol and added pills. They found him the next day on the bottom with some letters for the ppl he cared about. I still could cry when i think about him, since he was not only the ex-bf of my sis for long time, but also my friend. I took all of his comments about &quot;i dont want to live anymore&quot; lightly, because he always had this english humor. He even made jokes about it, when we all went out to drink something in a bar. No one seriously believed he would do something and he did..I still blame myself that i wasnt even near him to listen to his problems, that i didnt see the facts. I still wish i could have a last chat to tell him how much i cared for him being my friend.. But this chance is gone. My Mom only said: No matter what you would have done for him, he would have suicided, because those ppl who already decided to do it will finish it one day...<br>
<br>
So as a Note to all outside who got those deep empty feelings and wish to live their last day: The Pain you cause to others with suicide is as huge as your problems might seem by now, but there is always a way...and it is for sure not the path of death. <br>
<br>
<br>
so..and now i jump back to my articles, before i get too frustrated of this and my boss kills me because i didnt finish my work... <p><p style="margin-left: 0; margin-top: 1; margin-bottom: 0" align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Ultimate
