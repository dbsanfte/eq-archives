<br>
Ytrok: /agree (as usual, we got used of that a long time ago <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
Maniacles: Thats also a very good point. What really many people simply forget is that time did NOT start at 0 AD.<br>
Just because christians started to count time as Jesus (whoever that was)  was born (whoever could proove that), doesn't mean that time did start then.<br>
<br>
- Libraries of Alexandria. Hundrets of thousands of books with a HUGE knowledge, probably many many things we don't even know at all have been in those libraries.<br>
- Egypt. They have wrote thousands, even millions of books or similar things on Papyrus and in stone.<br>
- Hebräes (sp?). The invented written language a whole lot of time before the &quot;euros&quot;. <br>
- Roman Culture. Latin. Way before the birth of Jesus.<br>
- Greec Culture. Dito<br>
- Aztec Culture. Prolly thousands of years before Jesus was born.<br>
- The whole asian civilisation. Noone can doubt that fact that Chinese and Japanese Civilization way WAY ahead of us Euros (yes, US people are also euros...). They wrote books LONG LONG time before Euros even thought about using written language. <br>
<br>
Those are just a few high cultures which sure are WAY older than any christians even can think of since they simply start everything like 2000 Years ago. Pre Jesus there were some things... But all there really was are things like Noah, the Tower of Babel and such. Just stuff to teach the people to not do anything bad...<br>
<br>
&lt;---- And then you tell me that the Bible is the oldest book?<br>
Just because &quot;we Euros&quot; have destroyed everything else, doesn't mean it didn't exist! The Bible is in no way the oldest book. Just that millions of people tried hard to destroy everything else - in the name of god - to make sure just the bible (and the christian religion) survives. <br>
<br>
And what Nena says is a VERY important point.<br>
The Bible is not even very old actually. The Bibile was (maybe) written in hebräeic language. It then has been translated somewhen, by someone, who knows how good that person spoke hebräeic or latin. The first person that translated the Bible from Latin to french/english/german as like at 1600AD (more or less). You hardly can translate Latin to any of those languages without a huge loss of information. Words that have not been known have been invented, whole pages have been left out, whatever.<br>
Besides this... As Nena said, the Bible always has been editted the way it just pleased the Pope (and his men) the best.<br>
<br>
Things like the 6th and 7th Book Moses are not part of the Bible, they are illegal. They even are illegal in LAW, not just religion. What crap is that? Its part of the original Bible. but in those books Moses describes Black Magic. How you can hurt people with Magic and such stuff. OF COURSE the Church did not allow such things. Especially if they kill hundret of thousands of people because they are witches!<br>
Yes. The original Bible gives exact instructions how to hold black riuals and how to use Satans Power for your own strength. <br>
<br>
The bible clearly describes - even also now in the EDIT Version 4845.5 - things like the landing of UFOs, it describes rape of women by &quot;holy men&quot; - it clearly states that women are worth nothing. Why do you think NO Daughter of someone is listed in that huge lists of children? Who cares daughters!?<br>
<br>
THe Bible is packed full of contradictions. Exactly with the Bible you can tell the church that they are wrong. Even with the editted version. But the church knows to ignore the &quot;bad parts&quot;, knows how to interprete stuff really wrong and give really bad answers.<br>
<br>
The Bible is neither holy nor in any way a book of religion or &quot;the good&quot; or &quot;how to do it&quot;.<br>
The Bible is nothing else than a 100times editted book with many stories from the back. Great stories, interesting reports, tells you MUCH about how people lived at that times and how they acted and how they thought. But thats it.<br>
Its a wild mixture out of pure fiction, report, personal ideas and free translations, and many parts that are not there.<br>
<br>
The Bible sure is a good book. Its interesting.<br>
But I bet the original Version had nothing to do with THE GOD we know. It were just what I mentioned above.<br>
But the vaqlues and the ideas the bible tries to make you believe in are stupid. Especially since the church just picks things that suit them well. The parts that are not that nice, they either interprete completely screwed up, or mostly ignore.<br>
<br>
Did you know that in the middle age you could murder someone, then go to chruch, PAY a few silver coins and your sins have been officially forgiven? <br>
They had like a card or so where you could see how much a certain sin costs. Seriously, this was completely normal. <br>
Talk about god being corrupt! Haha.<br>
Well, its true and it was told by the church that this is ok and that good thinks its good like that.<br>
<br>
I have never ending arguments, really hundrests of them, why the christian religion (and some others, but I know the christian the way best) is nothing than pure cheating people, greedy bastards and in fact the most cruel murderers that killed more persons than ANYTHING else EVER and brought more pain than ANYTHING else EVER.<br>
<br>
But people that believe in it of course wouldn't listen to me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
They always and in every way just deny, say no, close their eyes and then shake head and say &quot;ahhh he doesn't know what he says, please forgive him god.&quot;<br>

<br>
I believe in the big bang because it makes sense because of the red change in the spectrum of the stellar objects, which proves that everything is moving apart because of the Doppler effect. So if everything has a red shift it HAS to mean that all objects in the universe are moving apart and proves that something in the creation of the universe exploded or set an outwards force when it was created and the big bang is probably a good idea to what created the universe, but the question is? What created it all in the first place? Another universe and contracted upon itself? If so then what created that? Another big bang? So the answer to the creation is probably way to complex for anyone's mind to fully grasp or understand, for now what would make the most sense would be &quot;god&quot; or a divine being force thing, but what would be the creator of such a force... and if there is a creator then what created that and so on.... (Starting to have a headache thinking about this).<br>

Maybe the answer is just<br>

<br>
But then whats the question to life, the universe and everything?<br>
