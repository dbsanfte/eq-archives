1) there are agents of the us that gather intelligence for us, some of which is sensitive and would divulge the person who passed that information.<br>
<br>
2) keeping track of someone who is trained in counter intelligence or even has a rudimentary knowledge of how to escape and evade surveillance teams could slip out of the tightest net.<br>
<br>
3) The government can charge and hold you as an enemy combatant at anytime as long as the proper personal are consulted and agree that you/yours are a threat to the us and here legally. Ergo the JAG has to be approached and consulted with as well as the head of the Justice department and certain members of his staff in the correct areas.<br>
<br>
This guy has been more than likely seen/photographed/eavesdropped on in a suspicious or illegal activity with the intent of causing/planing/supplying a terrorist incident and as such can be held due to the SC ruling in 1942.  <br>
<br>
If the US government, oh and btw the JAG isn't an elected official, nor is he a political appointee, says hes can be held, then make no mistake he can be.  Should they allow him access to a lawyer, probably, should they be able to hold him indefinitely no. Will he get a trial yes, will he be found guilty, if the government went to the trouble to arrest him, more than likely.  Did tier actions prevent or delay a terrorist attack in this country, hell yes.  Let this POS rot in hell for all I care, you wanna bomb innocent women and children they you don't deserve any rights in the country or any other. <p><img src="http://liquid2k.com/mzzc0l/revellie.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ubdnightfall.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BD Nightfall</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/13/02 7:09:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1490.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dirty Bomb Suspect</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> In my eyes this is a very dangerous decision and actualy shows every al-Qaeda member how afraid the us goverment is of them<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

So, because we locked one of their men up and don't give him rights, we are scared of them?  Uhm, I think it is more along the lines of showing them that we WILL take extreme action (in this case, taking away his &quot;rights&quot;) against them.

<br>
If he is a going to be tried as a traitor, then I am pretty sure he can be held till trial is over, under Military Law, but he'll be able to have a lawyer and all that happy horseshit.<br>
<br>
We don't need to have a declaration of war to hold him, either, btw. <br>
<br>
As for our Constitutional Rights being chipped away, this is grey area, always has been, always will be, regardless of what the Supreme Court says, because any Supreme Court ruling can be reversed, nothing is written in stone. Well, murder and shit like that are no-brainers, don't bother please. Hell, when we started making laws about seatbelts, our Constitutional Rights were being infringed on, /shrug...boohoo.<br>
<br>
Just because he is a US Citizen, doesn't automatically give him all the rights a US Citizen is entitled, especially if he is hanging around organizations that sponsor/use terrorism. Bring up anything you want from history, doesn't really matter, because it's moot. This is more a common sense issue, the fucking scumbag *allegedly* is hanging around jerk-offs that kill woman and children, and have fun doing it, rights my ass. <br>
<br>
I say give him a fair trial as a traitor, then kill him. Or, try him on war crimes (not sure if that applies), then kill him. Either way, if there is but a shred of evidence he was cohorting with Al-Quadi people (people- using that term loosely here), kill him before he kills me, or someone I care about.<br>
<br>
/sarcasm Or cry about how this sets precedent and how you can now be held without due process for anything the gov't sees fit and how awful the gov't is and how we are reverting back to the 50's and the commie witch hunts, (which i am sure all you educated people now know was highly illegal) and Jane Fonda is really cool and the german people really had no clue what hitler was doing to the jews. /sarcasm<br>

i think we must simply be mindful of the freedoms we are willing to give up in an effort to protect our freedom on a grander scale.  the real issue here is not Jose Padilla's rights and freedoms, but rather it is all of our rights and freedoms.<br>
<br>
&quot;They that give up essential liberty to obtain temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot;  - Ben Franklin<br>
<br>
my point is that we must watch carefully what actions our government takes in an effort to protect us.  new precedents may be set, which in turn may well lay the groundwork for other new precedents.  <br>
<br>
i am not against what is being done here, but everytime the government deems it is justified in essentially revoking a citizen's rights, it is worthy of the objective examination of the people.  our government should protect us, however me must also protect ourselves from our government. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucarabellavalenteen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carabella Valenteen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/13/02 8:51:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1490.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.dragonsong.org/immortalmercy/images/carabella22.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> Faust is a boner or Faust *has* a boner... such distinctions are very important! <p><font face="Blackchancery" color="#4682b4" size=+2>Carabella Valenteen</font><p>"The bonds of friendship are forged in laughter, but cemented in tears"</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uledge.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ledge</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/13/02 8:54:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1490.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OK</span><hr size=1> I am under no illusions that I am right or have the answers.

All of these things are at the center of this debate.<br>
<br>
Just don't be surprised if this is the slippery slope.<br>
<br>
How did that saying go.....when they came for man down the street I said nothing.....when they came for my neighbor I said nothing....and when they came for me there was not anyone left to say anyhting. Something like that.<br>
<br>
You are all supporting a government that can now arbitrarily and without ANY proof detain people indefinately and you are prepared to take them at their word. If that gives you piece of mind than great....if the thought of your government abusing its power seems alien to you than I fear your faith is blind.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying it will happen but your government just got alot stronger and your rights just got fewer and the fear of terrorism is making you say hey thats ok. That may be the new price of life in the 21st century, just watch out for inflation.<br>
<br>
Americans are now advocating for the suspension of their protections under the constitution and a reduction in their civil rights. Sounds like the terrorists are accomplishing way too much.<br>
<br>
In 1942 there was a formal declaration of war against a know enemy and state....the war on terrorism is not a &quot;War&quot; and as such the people the US and the world are fighting are not soldiers and are not subject to the same treatment. At least that is the argument that was being flow to defend not providing the enemy combatants at Guantonimo Bay with the protections of Prisonors of War under the Genievva Convention. So it sounds like it is a war until its not convenient and than is again a war if its again needed to be.<br>
<br>
Terrorists suck. What they did was the most horrible thing I have ever seen and it affected me greatly. I will not fly in airplanes or leave Canada for the forseeable future. If it were up to me I would see everyone of the people involved rounded up and exicuted if the law permit or imprisoned forever. Both these things can be achieved within the framework of law and not in secret and without decreaseing individuals rights.<br>

It is now possible for American citizens to be detained in America by their Government without charge or proof for an idefinite period of time at the sole discretion of said governement or its representitives be they elected or not.<br>
<br>
Bottom line. Its a brave new world.<br>
<br>
If you are ok with the above than thats just fine. I'm not saying if its right or wrong. It just is.<br>

No, this is not the case. I have 0% chance of being detained without charges or proof. You are being irrational, ignorant and argumentative for your own petty reasons. <br>

That is being ignorant for petty reasons. In this case tho it was sarcastic to illustrate a point.<br>
<br>
And exactly what are my reasons? To prove I am or am not smarter than a buch of annomous people on a game forum who play the same video game I do. I am not one who derives any self calidation from either EQ or this board. <br>
<br>
Someone here once said winning an argument on a internet forum was similar to winning a gold in the special olympics. Sure you won the gold but at the end of the day you are still retarded. That pretty much sums up what I think about winning or convincing people I am right.<br>
<br>
I am expressing an opinion that I may or may not agree with to expand the thought on a topic and develop an argument. You know the free exchange of ideas.<br>
<br>
Rah rah rah good ole' US of A it is the best country in the world with a history of doing everything right and a population that always agrees with the government and a government who does everyhting right all the time forever. <br>
<br>
There I agree with you....that makes for stimulating discussion. <br>
<br>
Go bury your head in the sand and question nothing ever including your own ability to self examine.<br>

<br>
                        If he is a going to be tried as a traitor, then I am pretty sure he can be<br>
                        held till trial is over, under Military Law, but he'll be able to have a lawyer<br>
                        and all that happy horseshit.&quot;<br>
<br>
My major malfunction is that he is NOT being held as a POW and the &quot;enemy combatant&quot; designation means they NEVER have to bring him to trial. He may deserve that from a moral view, but there is no guarantee that anyone else put under that same label would. It is legal according to the supreme court that was sitting in 1942, but that does not mean it is a dangerous tactic to get used to. Keep in mind that was the same supreme court that said it was OK to incarcerate Japanese Americans during WWII. In my view he should be tried for treason or charged with conspiracy to commit murder. If they think they lack enough evidence to convict, then designate him as a POW. IMO this legal limbo that exists now runs counter to our values and beliefs, even if it is convenient. <p>Gulor Gularin
