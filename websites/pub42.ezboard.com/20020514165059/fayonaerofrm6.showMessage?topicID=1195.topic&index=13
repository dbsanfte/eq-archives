Also dragging CB's name into this was ridiculous.  Correct me if I am wrong but Muff you are 59 or so druid that recently was in Shadowheaven.   You popped over to where Peqi (quest mob for Cloak of Truth) had spawned and wanted to take him down.  What you found was me in the building ready to take him down (yes I was naked but FM and buffed as a 60 shaman can do in little time).  I let you have him instead as a nice gesture and the fact I know how hard it is to get that guy.   Now you pull this crap and threaten CB?  Whatever.   Pull your head out of your ass and look around.  You never did communicate to Calris or Laerwyn any intentions of what you were going to do or what was happening.   Then you decide lets flame him here and CB too.   Brilliant move.  Pity Zehn is taking a break otherwise be nice to see him train your useless druid ass.<br>

Even I (who has a lot of quest information memorized for no apparent reason) do not know the name of every single quest mob and NPC in the game.<br>
<br>
<br>
As a rule, I tend to be completely opposed to the wanton slaying of quest NPCs, but at the same time questers should be expected to take responsibility for their own triggered quest mobs and NPCs.<br>
<br>
1. Never assume that everyone else in the zone knows the quest just because you do. This is especially true in cases where someone is hunting around the area where you are going to trigger an NPC or if it is a triggered mob/NPC.<br>
<br>
2. If your quest is in an outdoor area, do a shout/ooc/auction to see if anyone is hanging out around the area where your mob or NPC will be spawning. You will find that many players will temporarily move away from their camps just for you to do your quest if you put forth the effort of checking that they are there and asking nicely.<br>
<br>
3. Always be polite when asking people if they can move to a different spot while you are doing your quest. Do not use kewl, l33t or dood speak when making such a request of anyone. Remember, they are doing you a favour by moving and not the other way around.<br>
<br>
4. After confirming that nobody is present in the area(s) and you area ready to trigger the mob/NPC to spawn, do another shout/ooc/auction to warn KOS people. Again, most KOS people (if warned) will stay away while you are doing your quest if you take the time to let people in the zone know.<br>
<br>
5. If someone does move for you to do your quest, thank them. Always tell them when you are done and thank them a second time. It's just good manners to do so.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now consider this, if any mob or NPC (no matter how special it is) goes for a walk then agros on someone else without that person initiating combat with said mob/NPC... Verant's policies allow that person to defend their character in any manner that they choose. <br>
<br>
<br>
I'll have to side with the defendant (Laerwyn/Calris) on this one.<br>

Hell I'm a monk and can FD and if the little annoying ass dorf kept trying to kill me repeatedly after I kept zoning / Feigning him off several times, I'd have ganked his ass too just to alleviate the problem. <br>
<br>
&quot;So, anyhow, as I got the dorf near the dobbin camp he agroed calris, I rooted him so that calris could back off and camp, he did so after a bit, and came back. Then as im waiting for my root to wear off and him to return on his path to dobbin, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> laerywn starts to attack him, I told him to stop, and as he wasn’t stopping I got more and more mad and used more colorful language</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, eventually calris joined the fight&quot;<br>
<br>
Ok you were sort of on the right path here to prevent this but you probably should have spammed Layerwyn/Carlis both to please stop attacking Corbin or even the OOC/Shout channel for them to stop. I don't know if you've ever played two characters at the same time, but most likely what happened is this.  Laerywn runs over and starts attacking, he then goes over to his other computer to run Carlis there (and in the course of doing so  misses your tell you sent to him on laerwyn) to extract a little revenge and end this little menaces existence once and for all. Next thing he sees is someone swearing at him and making rude gestures at him, so he puts you on ignore.  All you probably had to do was either spam both of them with tells to stop, or just have spammed the ooc/shout channel with Laerwyn please stop or something to that effect and I'm fairly certain you would have avoided the incident altogether.  However sounds like you sent one tell, and when he didn't immediately respond you got hostile and abusive, thus resulting in him killing your needed quest mob.  Maybe next time if you take a more calm aproach rather than getting hostile/swearing and being rude you'll prevent things such as this.<br>
<br>
Oh and for all you whiny bishes (and partially because I've been dying to use the pic)<br>

<br>
those arent threats those are expressions of anger; like when someone flips you the bird, that expression of anger implies something nasty but that doesnt mean that the person flipping is going to actually try and well u know -p<br>
<br>
and dragging a guilds name into affairs whether justified or not is a surefire way to get people to look at a post; i didnt want my nag to just get one or two responces and then leave the front page.<br>
<br>
as far as ample warning to the zone when doing quest mobs like that, well ive done this quest 6+ times so far, and this is the first time ive come upon a problem like this guy before so i wasnt expecting it in the least.<br>
<br>
and i did tell him i need him for a quest shortly after i asked him to stop attacking, he continued to attack after that as well so i got frustrated<br>
i was perfectly willing to heal him after corbin had gone and done his thing to make up for the one or two hits he took; i would have healed him earlier but i wasnt sure if healing him would agro me again to the dorf and force me to camp/root again so was waiting; perhaps i should have been more talkative to him about the situation before he got laerwyn there but i fell into the assumption that he knew what corbin was for since he did back off and camp as asked to do.<br>
