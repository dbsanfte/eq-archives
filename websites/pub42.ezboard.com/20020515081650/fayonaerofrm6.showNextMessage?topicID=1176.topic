I can even remember a time when I was a young monk in WC and some hi level druid buffed me to the point that I could run around near invincible for a while. At the time I thought, wow this guy is cool.<br><br>So whenever someone asks for help, I just say, yes of course... I want to be cool just like that druid. Even if its in small ways, helping is a good thing to do.<br><br>A couple of weeks ago, while in the Kael arena our group was asked by a couple of toons, Monzara (SK) and Pyne (Rogue), if they could join our raid for faction and experience only. No loot. So of course we said sure, why not. We had been in the arena a little over four hours at the time and didn't need help, but its common courtesy to let people work on their faction. Most of us have been in that situation at one time or another.<br><br>7 minutes later (I have it logged) a plate helm drops, and guess who roll's? Monzara and he is hi roller. Immediately in my guild chat I hear, who is he? Why is he rolling? etc. Well, we explain the situation to the rest of the team there.  Then tell Monzara, you agreed not to roll and so you don't win the helm. Next highest roller is named and he loots. No more comments from Monzara or Spyne and I keep pulling.<br><br>Why did this guy even roll? Does he think its fair that we spend an hour or two setting up groups at zone in, hoping we get enough key classes and that someone else does not take camp, camp the arena for several hours, just so they can come in and cherry pick our cool drops? Seven minutes prior he asked us to join for faction, he was not interested in loot and experience. What short memories these guys have... What BS!<br><br>Look, I am into helping toons, but it would be totally unfair to the members who trooped it out from the begining to let these guys roll this late in the game and its not what they asked for or agreed to.<br><br>Less then an hour later (I had to leave but the person who put the event together along with the majority of original members are still in attendance) a plate bp drops. Guess who rolls again and gets the hi number? You guessed it, Monzara. He is told that he can not loot, and next highest roller is named and loots it. Monzara and Spyne have a fit.<br><br>It's bad enough that they ask us to join our raid, say they are not interested in loot and then roll at every opportunity (Spyne was rolling but not winning anything). Setting up cool events are enough work without having to deal with this kind of nonsense.<br><br>Shortly after this incident the group breaks up as the atmosphere is just not the same. So end of story right?<br><br>Two weeks later I hear about these two toons slandering our guild mate who had won the roll on the bp, when he was loooking for a group in Velks. &quot;Boooo&quot; was their comments and seemed to have convinced others of the truth of their words as they soon had a chorus. Also, from what someone told me at least, one of our guild mates left the guild because of a rumor these two toons started about the kael arena and &quot;Power Looting&quot; as they called it. Now I feel like I have to post something to address their slander as they are reducing the enjoyment factor of the game for at least one member of my guild, and maybe others (These two can go to hell as far as I am concerned.  They lied to get into our group, and are now apparantly lying to their friends about the whole incident).<br><br>I would by happy to hear Monzara's and Spyne's position (Although I have the kael arena with their, &quot;I only want faction&quot; promises logged, so not sure what kind of response to expect if any). It's certainly more civilized then whispering in dark corners and hissing when they come near my guild mate. I think these two should either step up here to the boards or shut up.<br><br>When I was a young monk I didn't understand why all toons where not helpfull. Finally after this incident I have some idea. Granted, allowing them in our raid for faction and experience is relatively minor way to help, but the hasle over something this minor makes you pause when others would ask for similar help. I still think the anwser is to keep helping people when asked, even when faced with the risk of having to deal with such nonsense. <p> <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=46040>Shuyung Softfist</a><BR><a href=http://agema.8k.com>Agema Guild Leader</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uedeina.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Edeina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Board Mistress</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(4/4/02 10:50:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1175.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.one.se/users/chribesk/edeina.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: No good deeds go unpunished...</span><hr size=1> Argh.<br>Now that sucks.<br><br>While it's not all that common, I think most of us have seen that kind of bullshit a few times over the years we have been playing.

Still, I agree that it's nothing to make a fuss over.

At best, this is confusing and at worst, this is attempted obfuscation, in violation of the condition that both parties agreed (if the veracity of the statement is not in doubt). It is extremely stupid to be rolling for &quot;shits and grins&quot; when an item drops and the group are rolling to determine looting rights. In such an instance, I would generally infer that the accused were rolling for looting rights. If not, then the action is not only incredibly dense but serves to disrupt smooth group-interaction. <br><br>Assume way too much? I hardly think that it is a great leap of logic to assume that if an item drops and the group starts to /roll, then they are rolling for the item. Simple solution: alpha roll (i.e. alphabetical rolling) in turn from a given range (e.g 1 to 100 for the sake of clarity). Highest number wins. Draws to be /rolled between the drawn players.

It just confuses and obfuscates the issue. If by refraining on /rolling - even for a short moment - it would greatly improve group-play, then why add a dynamic that merely causes tension?

Most of us have been in that situation at one time or another.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>This places into the explicit condition of the agreement, that the accused will not gain any loot from the raid. There should be no assumptions of anything else. Rolling or not they were not entitled to any loot. There does seem to be some disgressions in this agreement:<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Then tell Monzara, you agreed not to roll and so you don't win the helm.

Either way at this point it is now made clear to the accused. Do they now have an obligation to follow thru with the added request?<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;The subtext is that Shuyung (and myself, for that matter) does not like people who cannot follow simple instructions!

Seven minutes prior he asked us to join for faction, he was not interested in loot and experience. What short memories these guys have... What BS!&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>This is again implies that in the original explicit condition &quot;rolling&quot; was not allowed. It was not stated &quot;no rolling&quot; , it was stated no looting. <br><br>There is no mention that the accused demanded looting rights after they had agreed to the explicit terms laid down.<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;No more comments from Monzara or Spyne and I keep pulling.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>For the confusion it caused, that is the fault of the accuser.

I will address it though, a little.<br><br>The accuser admits that some of the original party, to include the accuser, had left the raid. The terms of the explcit agreement had no set time, other than assumed.

People from other guilds where in attendance and they rolled on loot.  The only difference was they became part of the group at or near the begining of the raid.  While a couple of us left before the bp dropped most of the toons who came on board from zone in where still in attendance and were rolling.  If you where with us early on you could roll just like anyone else.<br><br>Evidently you felt that it was not clear to you the terms of admittance to the event.  I can see how that can happen.

I want to clear our guild name as in our minds you were not entitled to roll for reasons already stated and the next highest roller was entitled to win.  I have stated my case and people can accept it or not as they see fit.

Especially disheartening considering there is a built-in spell checker.<br><br>My 2 cents...<br><br>I see intelligent arguments from one side and almost unintelligible, poorly written posts from the other.  Based on that, I would have to accept Shuyung's post as a reasonable facsimile of the truth. Though it would clear allot up if you could produce the log to see exactly what was agreed by both parties.<br><br>Nonetheless, on the first loot Shuyung said that Monzara was told &quot;you agreed not to roll&quot;.  If there was some confusion on this, it should have been cleared up then and there...not when a BP he really wanted dropped. Also Monzara, when you join a group and say &quot;I want faction&quot;, it can lead to confusion in whether or not you are there for loot.  I usually assume the person is there only for faction, though I can see how this may not be a good assumption in some cases.<br><br>I really don't care if it is you or your friends that are harassing Alchy.  Harassing in this way should not be tolerated.  By not asking your friends to stop...in my book, you are as guilty as they are.<br><br>Terhas<br><br>Man I love your posts...you put allot of thought and care in your posts.  That being said, I have to disagree with you about the rolling.  IF they did agree not to loot, they shouldn't have rolled, in my opinion.<br><br><br>Ailwon Ravenwind<br>&lt;Final Destiny&gt;<br><br>Hordza, you probably don't care, but, if I saw that post and you were applying for my guild...you would earn a solid &quot;NO&quot; vote from me.<br><br> <p>"For he who shall, so shall he who"<BR> - Puke&Snot</p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=1175.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=1175.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=1175.topic&start=61&stop=75>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showPrevMessage?topicID=1175.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showNextMessage?topicID=1175.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1175.topic&index=22><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=1175.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.threadControl?topicID=1175.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1175.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1175.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Diplomacy Corner<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Administration Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6>NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 6.7<br>Copyright 1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
