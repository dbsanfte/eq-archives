Your agnostic?   I always find that interesting<br>Try to keep in mind that its easy to be agnostic when your young and you have more days ahead of you than behind.  Your strong and ready, you have the world by the balls and your future is for you to decide.  The idea of faith, the act of accepting a higher power working in your life can seem as foreign as soap to Yeugo.  The challenge of Agnosticism is to keep the rejection and skeptism strong when you have more days behind you than in front.  Life is full of things that without meaning can destroy you.  The theory of Randomness and Chaos working in a full life is nearly impossible to grasp.  Yet at the same time attempts correlate some type of belief system into a logical mind is maddening.  But as you age, fall in love (real love) have children, lose peope you love and care about and see the world though more aged eyes, religion and faith become food for the soul, that right now, you dont even think you have.<br>To me, all religion, true belief and faith based religions I mean, are good. I feel it the same God, just broadcasting on all channels so everyone can hear the REAL message.  The central core of all of these, Christianity, hinduism, Islam, Buddism, Judism ect ect is Love.  Pure and simple.  And what is love but faith?  Can you ever really <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  KNOW</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> that person you love really loves you?  You cant see in that persons mind or feel thier feelings.  It requires a Leap of Faith as it known as.  Faith and Love are the same.  They need one another to survive.  So like you trust another person with your love so you learn to trust in a higher power.  Yes!  My life has meaning, Im not some genetic accident, some end result of some freak cosmic accident.  Their is something more, some reason for action besides motivated self interest.  <br>So when you say your agnostic, thats a good thing.  It means your thinking about these things, stuggling with the highest and loftiest ideas the human mind can come to grips with.  Your walking your own road to faith.  Trust me, in the end youll most likely be in a far different place than you are at the moment.<br><br>Struggling with his own walk of faith everyday <p>Lleauaric Fyrewynd<br>Sorcerer<br>Knight of Eternal Wrath<br>Ayonae Ro<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3749">Gear</a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ulleauaric.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lleauaric</A> at: 11/26/01 8:01:21 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/utreistaania.showPublicProfile?language=EN>treistaania</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/26/01 10:56:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=624.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> lleularic.... i aint that young you know..<br><br>and i did find belief in a diety more easy when i was younger, but when i grew up and got more objective i realized that what we generally call religion (read christianity) is a hoax and very very fabricated.<br>the bible itself is diffrent from generation to generation due to how the previous generation interpreted it.<br><br>the bible we know today is pretty much cut and paste from ancient myths and legends.. a blend of folklore <br><br>nothing in history has caused more havoc then religion.. <br><br>belive in yourself and come to terms of who you are instead of putting it in the hands of some non existant diety.<br><br><br>remember good does not exist without evil.. and vice versa.<br><br>itera <p><IMG SRC="http://user.tninet.se/~mhf993y/anna/sigfile.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ulogixspybreak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Logix Spybreak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>AyRo IRC OP</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/26/01 11:02:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=624.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  and i did find belief in a diety more easy when i was younger, but when i grew up and got more objective i realized that what we generally call religion (read christianity) is a hoax and very very fabricated.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>I agree.

The central message of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism is &quot;Obey or suffer.&quot;  You will find this in nearly all books of the bible (Esther and Song of Solomon lack much theistic content) and redolent within Islam.  For Buddhism, love takes on something of a different meaning since it must be distanced from Desire.  In any case, it has a strong (perhaps majority) secular following which makes it more of a philosophy than a religion.  I wouldn't presume to comment on Hinduism, of which I know little.<br><br>&lt;&lt;The challenge of Agnosticism is to keep the rejection and skeptism strong when you have more days behind you than in front.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Actually, I found the challenge of agnosticism was to decide precisely how these matters should be approached and to develop the mental tools to make a transition from agnostic limbo.  It also involved a great deal of study (reading the bible is not a light undertaking) and the desire to reach a point where an informed decision could be made.  Years of studying numerous sides of these eternal arguments led me to the conclusion that no theism has demonstrated even a tiny likelihood of validity.

I'd say the majority of practicing christians (not to be confused with professed christians) actually have a firm belief in their religion based upon life events and not childhood teachings.  I say this because most of the practicing christians I have had contact with were not raised christian.  Instead, they were raised to believe something else (or nothing at all) and found that the christian teachings followed what they felt or some dramatic event in their life lead them to christianity.<br><br>I take the bible as what I think it was truely meant to be:  a guide.  I dont see how it can be taken as anything else.  There have been too many translations between texts, priests adding personal sentiments, and outright omissions for the bible to be taken as a literal textbook.<br><br>I do, however, believe in God.  I was raised as a christian and i keep that belief, not through naivety on my part, but simply because my faith has been tested and it remains intact.

I am skeptical of anyone who thinks they have it all figured out.   <p>Lleauaric Fyrewynd<br>Sorcerer<br>Knight of Eternal Wrath<br>Ayonae Ro<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3749">Gear</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uedeina.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Edeina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Board Mistress</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/27/01 12:10:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=624.topic&index=13>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.one.se/users/chribesk/edeina.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: since i know it will turn into a nag ill post it here.</span><hr size=1> Actually, L2, it seems you ARE kinda agnostic.<br>The anti-religion you describe is Atheism.<br><br>Agnosticism = claiming to not know any Final Truth.<br>Atheism = claiming that the Final Truth is that there is no God.<br><br>Then of course there are different versions of atheism and agnosticism. <br><br>Atheism can be simple disbelief and it can be orthodox fundamentalism, viewing all religions people and everyone who isn't rabid enough in their atheism to be Heretics Against The One True Faith In The Lack Of God.<br><br>Agnosticism can lean towards undogmatic faith like you, or towards atheism like me who don't think there is a god but don't believe that I *know* if there is one or not, don't think I'll ever find out, and isn't bothered in the least by this lack of knowledge. <p>Love, Edeina<br>Highelf Arch Mage of Erollisi.<br>Citizen of <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero">Ayonae Ro</a>, member of <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/beternalwrath">Eternal Wrath</a>.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=varulvthewarrior>Varulv the Warrior</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/27/01 12:19:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=624.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Belief</span><hr size=1> I respect and in many ways envy those who can believe in a god.

I used to force my mum to go into every church we passed because I wanted to see how they looked inside and how it "felt" to be there. My mother however doesn't have a religious bone in her body and she wasn't too "happy" about my obsession with churches.. I was not baptised and by the time I was 14 I wanted to dunno the english word.. hmm.. it's konfirmera in Swedish.. gaah I'll have to edit when I figure out the word. My mum payed me not to do it, so I didn't. <br><br>Growing older and getting to know other religions then just christianity I noticed that there is nothing I can say that I really belive in, I would like to make my own religion just pick a few pieces from every religion - is this possible please? =). Religion was my favorite subject in school and after a few papers I wrote in "gymnasiet" (age 16 to 19) my teacher told me I was the worst feminist she had ever seen and to keep at it. I stopped after that, the last thing I am is a feminist, and my interest for religion ebbed out.<br><br>I don't belive in any God, I would like to. But I am unable to, I can't see the truth the christians, muslims, buddists, etc etc. talk about, it's not visible for me... in my eyes there could not possibly be a God. <p><IMG SRC="http://user.tninet.se/~mhf993y/anna/sig.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=624.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=624.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=624.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=624.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=624.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=624.topic&start=121&stop=131>7</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showPrevMessage?topicID=624.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showNextMessage?topicID=624.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=624.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=624.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.threadControl?topicID=624.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=624.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=624.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Diplomacy Corner<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Administration Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6>NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
