<br>
I think that we could have made an arrest, held him without bail due to flight risk and danger to the public.  Give him an attorney, and anything else that is constitutionally mandated...and not a drop more.  We do that as it is without constitutional violation.  He is a citizen.  We need to follow the rules.  In a republic, that's what it's all about.  The rules apply to everyone, no matter how powerful they are, no matter how weak they are, no matter how guilty they obviously are.  Don't get in the mindset that we're just breaking the rules for this guy, so it's not a big deal.  There is no "small" violation.  If he is able to talk to an attorney, I can't see that being a threat to the public; *AND* we're covering our legal asses at the same time.  <br>
<br>
Make no mistake, I think he's a scumbag.  I think he's guilty, and I also think that he'd be better off at room-temperature.  BUT - me thinking he's guilty doesn't make it so.  I am 100% positive that they didn't just arbitrarily pull some guy off the street just because he went to visit Uncle Mohammed.  I am sure he was up to no good.<br>
<br>
What's weird is that I wouldn't have as much of problem with it if we found out ten years from now that the CIA found some guy trying to bomb the shit out of his own country, captured him, tortured information out of him, and then ran over his head with a medium-sized fork-lift...repeatedly.  What bothers me is that they said anything at all.  Quietly apprehending him, torturing him and killing him is illegal.  I expect that out of the CIA, and think it's part of the cost.  What I don't like is that they are making it known that they are violating the law (This remains in question, but the fact that it is being questioned makes it...uhh, for lack of a better term, "questionable.")  So they are, in essence, making us all accomplices in the violation of a citizen's constitutional right.  I know it sounds weird that I'm OK with the situation if I don't know about it, but that allows me some plausible deniability.  In this situation, I feel that by making it known, we are now complicit by way of silence. <p>Faust<BR>

This thread is the epitome of the American mindset.  It's opposing opinions hammered out in an open forum.  While we take a lot of flack from our European counterparts on these boards, this thread is a shining example of how America works.  We don't agree with everything our government does.  We discuss it.  We challenge it.  And, if enough people object to it, we change it.  I have been most impressed with the &quot;high road&quot; taken in this debate.

<br>
The label makes all the difference because completely diferent rules are applied to different labels. Are we the Soviet Union where someone could be grabbed off the street, held in secret without access to any legal help or even visitors for years at a time? I sure as hell hope not. I don't want this guy on the streets either, but when was the last time you saw &quot;bail&quot; granted to a POW? What judge would even consider setting a bail for an accused terrorist? IMO there would be NO risk in this guy getting back on the street in today's environment. Yes this guy is likely a threat to US citizens, but what about anyone else who is not but gets tagged as an &quot;enemy combatant&quot;? Believe it or not, innocent people do get accused of crimes and with no trial mechanism what are they supposed to do? I am not willing to give up my right to a trial because it is convenient for some attorney general or FBI agent to put me away. <p>Gulor Gularin

He has a lawyer, atm he is being held indefinately until the war on terrorism passes and he is no longer considered a threat.  He does not have normal access to his attorney, because in the past it is believed that terrorist have used their attorneys to relay messages to other terrorist to keep the ball rolling on whatever mission they have planned.  Dont worry about this guys rights, Im sure Donna Newman will be rattling the sabre to keep the govt from doing too much to this guy, especially now that it gets her on CNN a lot more than shes used to.  Dont worry lawyers are like cockroaches they never go away, thats what makes america, americans have a 2 sided system to check and balance one another.  Its not blind faith, its a 2 sided system, and it works better than communism.  SO this guy does have an attorney, and you do have to admit this is not a normal criminal situation, this is a wartime situation, and yes we are at war, this is a new type of war in a new century.  Some can say we brought it on ourselves decades ago when we forced a state of isreal back into the middle east, and its funny that we care so much about keeping Isreal happy and forcing them back into the middle east and giving them their homeland back, yet we were more than happy to do the same overrunning of territory to the native americans, and we dont sell them F16s we just gave them casinos.  Oh well thats a whole other thread.  I dont think this case sets a precedent that wasnt already possible, do i think people who associate themselves with terrorist should be lookin over their shoulders now, probably.  But I have noticed George Bush goes out of his way to spell out that we are not at war with Islam, that Islam preaches peace, we are at war with terror and that is the Al queda network, who this guy was meeting with.  A lot has changed since 1942 and WWII, is it so outrageous to think that warfare will not.  Technology does a lot to change warfare, and the psychology and tactics of warfare, adaptation is the key to survival, and these terrorist have taken war to a new level, they are using vunerabilities in the system to do damage and fear.  Is it a war we will ever win, that has yet to be decided, just hope it goes better than the war on drugs.  <br>

Because they are so open to many different interpretations, but are more detailed than a non lawyer would even guess. As an enemy combatant, this guy has a lawyer, he just doesnt get to talk to her, see above post.<br>
<br>
If the War on terror ends tomorrow, this guy is no longer a threat and gets out.  (not likely, but possible).<br>
<br>
This guy falls under military rules, he is a solider in the al queda network.  For heavens sake its not like we picked up a 7 year old child and labeled them &quot;enemy combatant&quot;.  If anyone can come up with a reasonable argument other than, the govt can make up whatever they want now about your background and call you an enemy combatant I would love to hear it.  Do you think this guy was in the middle east on vacation, or heck ill give a little doubt and say maybe he just travels there to pray a lot.  Was he on a humanatarian effort NO.  Do anyone honestly think this guy was not working for a terrorist cell.  Before you say the Government made this up, come up with at least a valid argument of how.  And if it is some great Xfiles conspiracy, were all screwed anyway cause the aliens or whatever are running everything anyway. <br>
<br>
Also, we still deal with domestic terrorist different than the member of al queda, look at that freak kid that was driving around the country blowing up mailboxes, is he being held as an enemy combatant,,,,,NO.  But within this evil Govt can do whatever they want sort of thinking he could be.  SO if that kid becomes an enemy combatant, who has no ties to terrorist that are known or revealed, then bring out the soapbox and say how we are blind to what the administration is doing.  <br>
<br>
And with the freedom of everyone and right to know everything, and back to buz's comment about will we ever know what Bush knew before Sept 11, I doubt we will, but the question is will it do any good.  The intelligence community is already getting a massive overhaul as it is to make things more organized and allow info to get passed along, but of course now its bottlenecked by the fact no one wants to pay for it.  Do you really think if we had issued a warning that planes were going to hit world trade center and told all those businesses to shut down for a day, and lose all the money and productivity of one day, and then nothing happened, what then.  Everyone would have been calling Bush an idiot, and overly paranoid, the sad thing is even if someone saw Sept 11 coming, it wasnt believable anyway, and no one would have listened, maybe that should be the new Topic of this thread.<br>
<br>
WOuld you have believed a warning about Sept 11?<br>
<br>

Just my 2 cents again<br>

Yes this guy is probably guilty. But the precedence is being set where anyone can be seized on any pretext (even a traffic stop), he can be labeled as an enemy combatant after a short internal review in the AGs office and shipped to a military prison where he can be held incommudicado as long as the military feels like. There is no chance for the accused to prove his innocence. There are no protections that even basic human rights are observed except the good will of his jailors. There is not even necessarily required that he must be released once hostilities are declared over, if any such declaration is ever made. (For example, there has never been a peace treaty signed for the Korean war...if someone had been seized as an enemy combatant in 1950, he could still be locked up.)<br>
<br>
If it were required that such prisoners be put before a miltary tribunal to answer the charges it would be an improvement. Right now, there is no requirement to do so. If we try him, its on our good graces not because we are required to. <p>Gulor Gularin

<br>
I was just reviewing the first ten (conveniently placed on my wall...I'm such a patriot) amendments, and happened by number five.  Reviewing it for entertainment more than thinking it was relevant I stumbled upon something.  Silly me for not coming up with it beforehand.<br>
<br>
<i>No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, <u>except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or <b>public danger</b></u>; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.</i><br>
<br>
Underlining and emphasis mine...for people that miss the obvious points. <p>Faust<BR>

Well, shit, I rekkin' he is right there. Even though this ass-jacker is a big threat (or assumed to be, or TOLD to me to be) to my country, he is a citizen (no matter how misguided THAT idea was at the time), and therefore entitled to the protections provided him by our constitution. Should he be held without counsel? Should he be stripped of his constitutional rights? Should he be allowed bail...excessive or not? What the fuck do we do with this guy? Stand our ground and trade his rights and potentially our own rights later to buy a small amount of security now&quot;<br>
<br>
Wow do you value or life or your family's life or the lives of the people in your community, country, etc?  This man made a bomb and it was reported that he planned to attack hotels and gas stations.  They also said he was tied to the al-Queida network.  He should be dealt with the same way we are dealing with all the others in Afganistan, etc associated with the terrorism - American citizen or not.<br>

I have seen before where this has been exercised responsibly, like after a hurricane in Wilmington NC the power was out in most of the city for a week so they called in the national guard, and declared a curfew and martial law.  Did I whine and carry on about how 'oh on the govt has taken away my freedom', no, they were there to prevent morons with self serving interest who would go out an loot and rob because there was no power for alarm systems, because the police were handicapped to respond due to the overwhelming nature of the situation.  We dont live in a perfect world, but I think America has a pretty good thing goin for it, the constitution provides for a lot, and is allowed to be interpreted by those in power, oh my goodness, democracy.  Whats your alternative?  Let this guy go?  Do you really think, reasonably, the CIA is gonna storm your house, and drag you off and label you &quot;enemy combatant&quot;.  <br>

I am just saying I don't like it and telling you why I don't like it. Everyone knows that different rules apply under martial law. But martial law can be abused if we don't pay attention. I think a few more controls need to be legislated into this whole &quot;enemy combatant&quot; scenario to prevent abuse by politicians (I have a healthy suspicion of politicians in general).<br>

<br>
I do not advocate letting this guy loose by any means. I do think he should be allowed access to a lawyer , government appointed if needed. There are other ways to prevent &quot;messages&quot; from being sent via attorneys such as gag orders. <p>Gulor Gularin

<br>
Sure.<br>
<br>
<i>This man made a bomb</i> <font size=-3>(Didn't.)</font> <i>...and it was <u>reported</u> that he <u>planned</u> to attack hotels and gas stations.  <u>They</u> also <u>said</u> he was tied to the al-Queida network.</i>  <font size=-3>(Underlined some stuff for ya to consider.)</font>  <i>He should be dealt with the same way we are dealing with all the others in Afganistan, etc associated with the terrorism - <u>American citizen or not</u>.</i> <font size=-3>(I disagree.)</font>  <br>
<br>
It seems that he is being handled in a different manner from the Taliban combatants *and* in a different manner from "run of the mill" criminals and criminal suspects that are citizens.  My stance at this time is, it seems to be in line with the dictates of Amendment V, so all is well.  I still don't get any real warm fuzzy feelings from the manner in which it's being handled, but he isn't on the streets so the big threat has been removed, and you and I can agree that this is priority one.<br>

And as for keeping politicians in check, dont worry about that, i think the last presidential election showed there is a narrow margin for error in being elected, and the democrats and republicans seem to be finger pointing quite a bit lately.  If anything the president has to watch his step more closely than any president in history, did FDR get questioned about what we knew before Pearl harbor?  With the media and party politics I dont think anyone is going to get away with much.  If anything we are now too PC, with how every single decision effects the outcome of everything.<br>
