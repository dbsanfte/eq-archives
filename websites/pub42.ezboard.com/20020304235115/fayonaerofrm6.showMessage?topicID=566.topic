I am a monk. I don't believe I'm greedy (wicked laugh), but I agree that monks and warriors are possibly the greediest class by nature, merely because they love &quot;stat plz&quot; talk and rush to inspect every new melee in the zone. &quot;wut u wearing, bro?&quot;<br>
<br>
I do the pick up group thang, because it's a great way to meet new people. I understand what the values are of a majority of Everquest players. I know what the goals are of a majority of Everquest players. I still do the pick up group thang, because I will and have met great people in this way. <br>
<br>
Upon joining an pick up group, I examine the behavior of each group mate. Are they negatively assertive, over-anxious to loot and pull. Bad leaders, do they have inferiority complexes, are they vulgar......and how much does loot govern their playstyle. <br>
<br>
I was told that there was a time when treasure of a majority of pick up groups was bestowed upon players in a need before greed fashion, (He who can use as an improvement is entitled). <br>
<br>
This has changed, seemingly to a factor of not trusting the players you group with. How you can play a game of any kind with someone you don't like....I do not know. <br>
<br>
If I am playing with friends, and we invite a stranger into a group....and an item drops. That player has the right to seek the item regardless of who can use it. However, the player is measured afterwards by having sought an item best suited for another...and will not be invited again.<br>
<br>
I sponsor playing for friendship, and aquiring new friends. I do not sponsor &quot;gimme, my twinkie need and I go EC after fight kk?&quot; attitudes. <br>
<br>
At the same time, I will not accept a group's offering of &quot;here, you should have this,  it's a monk item&quot; if I am not positive the group in full believes I should. If I read a sentence or sense that another player is not happy that the item goes to one player of a particular class. It is neccessary for all to roll and do as they will with the reward.  <br>
<br>
Guild rules, Shmuild rules !  Your playstyle is defined by your perspective on treasure.  All it takes is one night of &quot;fuk nb4g d00ds and bros, I wizzie and no wizzie stuff drps here. how i make pp?&quot; attitude and your reputation is shot, even if you happen to walk away with a new toy. <br>
<br>
I hope for you, the goal is not to see who has the most items and platinum collected when the game ends. <br>

<br>
Who's to say Buddydood_01 did not just drop his fungi tunic off on a mule in EC.<br>
<br>
Who's to say that selling item x that I can not wear and buying item y that I can't wear would not address my &quot;need&quot; and that my &quot;need&quot; is greater than Buddyguy_01 who can immediately wear said item.<br>
<br>
The only way to be completely fair in a p/u group is for everyone to have an equal chance at everything. Everyone puts in the same effort. Everyone should have the same chance at reward. Failing that, each member in that p/u group should go camp an item of equal &quot;need&quot; for each member in that group (oh wait thats what guilds are for).<br>
<br>
I can honestly say that being a 59 Shaman with fungi tunic and staff, I have no desire to do a P/U group in Sebilis King when I have zero chance at gaining anything (xp not withstanding). I don't think this makes me gready, or a bad person. I have had some great P/U groups, in which everyone agrees that everyone can roll on an item. I won't join one where I have no chance of being rewarded for my time.<br>
<br>
My pet peeve, is folks who join an p/u group. It is decided that everyone will have an oportunity to roll on everything. A RBG drops. We all roll. And the female level 60 warrior once losing the roll, bails mid-pull near lower exit 'cause she did not win. Things were fine, til she lost.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I have passed on items in p/u groups I do not want, need or that I recognize that another can use. I count myself lucky to be well equipped, but I certainly would never fault someone who won a roll on any item in any p/u group (including the mage and wizzy who have won the last 2 RBG's I saw drop. Gratz guys) 'cause their time is just as valueable as mine, and I'm not a socialist.<br>

<br>
the game is by design noting more then a way to show others your status and that is done by items.<br>
<br>
a wizard can get great stats with really cheap old world items but then we will be looked down at and some will even send him tells and laugh... thats the reason you need nifty things<br>
"hey look what i got!"<br>
<br>
and whats wrong with that?<br>
<br>
need before greed sounds really honorable and nice but in reality it will only benefit a few, take seb for ex: is need before greed the fair way when camping king? i think not since that way any caster or someone with better wont be able to roll on the item people go there for.<br>
and as the previous poster said.. if the wizard can trade the fungi tunic for a nice item he can use then he has just as much need of the fungi as anyone else.<br>
<br>
no drop items are a diffrent matter since the one with the best use of it wouldnt roll if he wouldnt use it.<br>
<br>
a little example..<br>
<br>
cloak of piety  one of the best haste cloaks and it has wonderful stats especially for paladins and SKs (and rangers)<br>
but since its all/all warriors /rog /monk wants it too..<br>
its a fact that rog/rng/mnk epics are all easy and have haste as effect but that dont stop them since they want the stats..<br>
and warriors say "we dont have haste on epic" but the int and wis is wasted on a warrior.<br>
best classes is and always will be SK and PAL for cloak of piety since they dont have haste on epics, they do use all attributes on the cloak.<br>
but more often then not its decided in the name of need before greed that all melee roll on it....<br>
then why not casters? the cloak has wonderful stats for a caster even druids and clerics would love this cloak but they are not in the "needing" group...<br>
i can not understand the logic of that.<br>
<br>
dropable things in pickup groups should be lottoed to everyone in the group if fairness is an issue<br>
and if fairness isnt an issue why lotto at all?<br>

Its mostly all gear that requires at least a group of good friends that gel well together on hunts to a full out raid in order to obtain. Either way, there is advance planning involved but its all obtainable by most any compitent over 50 guild.<br>
     Pick up group stuff (droppable gear outside of dragon stuff) is to the point that it is about 50-70% twink/EC fodder, since its Good enough to fetch a few plat, can be equiped by any level and its common at this point since nothing in EQ ever wears out. If cars were made by VI, we would still be alot of people driving Model T's, all with the original brakes and tires. Cars would also cost almost nothing and still run like new ( Unless you wanted the LATEST car. That will cost you)<br>
        Chances are most everyone has something out of Sebilis rotting in the bank that used to be the ultimate best in the not so distant past. So no one really &quot;Needs&quot; anything like that anymore, since the droppable stuff just isn't as good as quest or second Tier planer ( PoG, Upper Hate, PoM), might as well face the fact that most anything droppable now is going to be in EC real soon.<br>
    As for Haste cloaks like the one you mentioned:<br>
It takes a guild to kill those targets and its up to the guild's loot policy as to who gets something like that. Most of the time, if the drop table of a target is known, than discussion can be done before hand to determine what class is best entitled and what member actually needs it the most.<br>

I remember the first time I saw a cobby part drop and one of the guys in the group said grats Bobbib.<br>
A few days after I am in another group in Karnors and ES arms drops, we had a guy in group that wanted to roll (ranger) but our druid got the arms ofcource since I knew how happy I was when my group gave me cobby gaunts. That druid later joined my former guild and we are very good friends now much because of those ES Vambracers :)<br>

I think if more ppl looked that way upon loot we wouldnt have the me me me situation that often ocours in p/u groups and we could focus on getting exp.<br>
I like p/u groups too of the same reasons as stated in previous posts, its a great way of meeting new ppl but sadly I usually do guildgroups nowdays since there is to many that dont like nb4g nowdays :(<br>

Sux doing NBG in that case, but still you did not loose anything cause it was not urs to begin with.<br>
I will always play NBG, be it with strangers, twinks or god knows what. It's the only way I play this game.<br>

I do not care a rats ass about loot in any form, if I want something I will go get it, if I am there for exp, then I am there for exp and not because mob X drops item B.<br>

I did think, for a long time, that NBG was the way to go.  And, after watching all the melee loot go by, and not seeing anything outside of research components, I decided I didn't like it so much anymore.<br>
<br>
Nowadays, I'm blessed with friends, wealth and pretty nice gear.  I usually pass up on rolling on things I wouldn't equip.  However, I still don't agree with NBG in pick-up groups, even if I won't roll on most things.  I don't feel it's right for ANYONE to not have a shot at a reward, as it was a team effort.  In a perfect world, melee loot and caster loot would be balanced everywhere, and everyone would be able to get an equal shot at something, and everyone would be perfectly honest.  But, that's not how it is in Norrath.  And, there will be those who say 'Well, casters don't need equipment really.'  Have you ever seen an Enchanter trying to do CC down to King naked?  Ever see how much a Wizard can nuke with no mana gear?  No, I likely won't die if a level 45 mob attacks me while on CR, while a Warrior might.  However, in order to do my best, I do need more than 800 base HP.<br>
<br>
Honestly, if you think that someone who is against NBG in your group reflects a bad reputation, I suggest you reconsider the fact that Kunark is ~80% melee loot (and VL camps are fairly stingy on that, as well), and maybe you might realize this makes you look a bit greedy yourself.<br>

Part of the thrill and the excitement of the game is when you are doing the experience grind you happen to come across a decent loot that you might get a chance to roll on no matter what class you are. Let the dice roll /random 100 1000...damn 100 WTF..usually how it goes for me, I loose and go on with life and someone is happy that they won..the next choice is up to who won..Hmm do I really need this..or could the guy next to me that I grouped with for a few hours and is really a cool person..(might not even be in your guild) need it?<br>
This is the part that interest me...Greed or Need... I guess one good thing about a real greedy person is that they will hopefully find boredom fast in the game and move to greener pastures and let the people who love to play EQ play. Everyone knows that if you are setting up a King group its for one reason..FUNGI's. I don't have a problem with that..don't think anyone would want to gather a pick up group, work there way to the King, and then hand over a Fungi to a complete stranger cause you thought they could use it more than you..come on by the time you can actaully do the King in seb..55 is usually minimal lvl and you should have something decent by then to use as your BP..so go for it roll and see if you can win one to collect dust in your bank or go on your lvl 1 monk or a friend of yours..what ever. I like to see everyone get at least one Fungi...but the part that kills me is that when someone does win they send you a tell...Dude loot that fungi, I got one in the bank I cant loot it..LMAO. Is that greed..hmm?<br>

This is regardless of if they use &quot;need before greed&quot; as their excuse or something else. <br>
<br>
A item of some value drop. Noone really need it, but everyone could benefit from it in one way or another. Then some greedy asshole start demanding priority for whatever bullshit reason, like that he would equip it so he could sell his old and also valuable item in EC.<br>
<br>
I don't dislike the NBG system as such, it do have it's places. But the name is very misleading.<br>
<br>
In my eyes it's obvious that NBG should be the default in 100% guild/friend groups, while equal lotto for all should be default in pickup groups, even if most of the group is friends or guildmates. Basically, NBG works between people who would give each other the items they need anyway.<br>
<br>
When a item drops, everyone who helped getting it have the same right to it. If someone is given priority over someone else, then it is not because he deserve it more but because the group want him to have it.<br>
<br>
The greedy assholes are not the ones who prefer NBG or FFA, but the ones who go apeshit over loot, demand to be treated differently then the agreement (demanding FFA when the group have agreed on NBG, and vice versa).<br>
<br>
When I do pickupgroups I keep the rules simple: total FFA *and* total NBG, as long as everyone agree. That is, everyone loot whatever they want, and if someone want a item then it is given to him. If there is a disagreement of any kind, then everyone lotto and the winner chose who get the item. If you want FFA then chose yourself if you win, if you want NBG then chose the one who you think would benefit most from the item. The winners choise is final, don't bitch about it. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

I have to agree here. It is much easier to just go with whatever the group wants and not make a big deal over either type.<br>

<br>
 I remember one group in DL that I was in where a Forest Loop had dropped. Now the original rule of the group leader was FFA. So we all roll and monk wins. Then the druid (I think) starts complaining that he needed it more and that his roll (which was very low) was only practice. He rolls again and gets a max roll. Now he is saying that he won even though it was his second roll. Since the leader was AFK and the druid and his guildmate really thought that he won the item we decided to wait until leader was back and let her decide. Well, leader comes back and decides that we will all roll again. Ok, so we all roll again and this time I win. Immediately the druid starts telling me, &quot;Hey, I'll give ya XXX plat for it.&quot; Under normal circumstances I would have been more that happy to just give him the item, but being that he had already raised such a stink over losing the first time I decided to give the earring to the monk who had originally won IMO. The discussion went on as to how I wasn't wearing the earring. blah blah blah. When I told them that I had given it to the monk they we more than a little bit ticked. Eventually the leader had to say that since I had one it, it was mine to do what I wanted to. I felt that my action was the more honorable one and declined to answer them about it after. I eventually ended up leaving the group after that because it all broke down into a &quot;bitch about everything the monk does&quot; situation. I guess that isn't exactly NBG but like I said I would have been more than happy to give the druid the earring had he not complained so much about it to start with. That in my eyes went beyond NBG and straight to plain Greed. <p><center><br><b>Karanur Dville</b><b>

<br>
That means that if others wish to random on everything, you shouldn't stop them; but you should random too, and when you win you give the item to the person who needs it.  That way you personally get to feel good about NBG, and maybe you'll convince someone else that it is a good idea.<br>
<br>
The other thing is: if you want your pickup group to be anything other than all-random, please say so at the beginning.  It will save a lot of heartache.<br>

<br>
When in a pickup group..lets say sebilis...and hmmm Mrylokars helm drops...rogue in group needs..okay fine i would give it to him. Now 10min later a RBG drops...i would allow all to lotto on this item...for a caster this could fetch them a major item in EC..just as the item itself is a major catch for a tank. <br>
<br>
I have never had a problem with dealing with loot in any p/u group i have been in. If loot drops and you dont agree with something im doing , shoot me a tell and we'll work it out before the item is awarded...or rolled on. <br>
<br>
but i dont know..im a old ogre, and i rarely if ever do pickup groups anymore...<br>
