This proves that we have been to PoM, as you have to have been to PoM to get quest items.<br><br>Anyways, on with it.<br><br>Not too long ago, a few weeks, Mogur asked me to hold onto a Blue Throne while he was clearing the Alice In Wonderland area (Where the Throne cards now drop alone).  Being the nice guy I am, agreed to.  However, before full spawn had passed, I had to log to go to work.  I kept it on me for the time being.<br><br>Later in the day, I logged back on.  We were doing a raid on Velketor and I went.  Yasp needed just the Blue Throne to finish creating Plane of Mischief Mage leggings.  After teasing him a bit, I finally agreed to Mogur asking me to give the throne to Yasp.<br><br>Yasp and Mogur at the moment were trading.  Yasp was showing Mogur what cards he had.  I in the meantime was rapidly clicking on Yasp with the throne card wanting to trade it to him so I could go back to buffing myself with my okiels' boots over and over again as I usually do to pass the time.<br><br>As soon as Mogur and Yasp had finished, <br><br>The trade has been canceled.<br>The trade has been canceled.<br>The trade has been canceled.<br><br>Three times.  I checked my inventory.  Despite the Blue Throne being a tiny item, and me having more then one empty backpack, as well as an empty inventory slot, the throne was no longer there.  I had -never- hit the "Accept Trade" button.<br><br>I asked the guild if anyone had it.  Nobody did.  Both Mogur and Yasp denied having it.<br><br>Now, if you know Yasp, he's a bit of a dork, but honest.  He complains alot about the Mage epic, but he's shut up since he's finally finished.<br><br>Despite being an ass, Mogur is honest as well.  He's helped me finish -several- high end quests by generously giving me his own stuff to finish them.<br><br>I -know- it wasn't in my inventory, and I'm sure the GM would have later informed me it was still in my inventory.  Kinda hard to petition about something not being in your inventory when it's right there.  Anyways.<br><br>We (Yasp and Myself) petitioned.<br><br>Soon enough, Desilous (Our servers GM) responded.  I explained the situation up to that point, including what had happened earlier in the day as to how I aquired the card.<br><br>Desilous apparently had already been dealing with Yasp.  He informed Yasp that it had indeed been traded to someone, but he could not reveal to whom.  That made sense in and of itself to the both of us.  Yasp said so over the guild channel.<br><br>After a breif conversation in which I had explained what happened from my point of view, he told me he would have to look into it more, would get back to me and contact me when he found out what had happened.<br><br>About 30 seconds later he logged.<br><br>Several weeks went by.  Tired of waiting, I finally petitioned.<br><br>He told me the following.<br><br>1)  I had indeed traded it.<br>2)  He had "Talked to the person to whom I traded it to."<br>3)  He could not tell me to whom I traded it to.<br><br>After spending roughly half an hour asking why he couldn't inform me as to whom I had traded it to, he logged without explanation.<br><br>Tonight I petitioned again.<br><br>After half an hour, and several guildmates co-petitioning along with me, and explaining that it was -ridiculous- that I shouldn't be allowed to know where something from -my- inventory had gone, he "recieved permission" to tell me to whom I traded it.  He said I gave it to Mogur.<br><br>Before he finally broke down however, the following occured.<br><br>1)  He accused Yasp of having it (Yasp said as such in the guild channel).  Yasp denied having it at any point.  We all know that neither Yasp, nor Mogur, nor I have it, nor had it at any point after the defunct trade.<br><br>2)  He informs me that I did indeed trade it to someone.  It is the only way it could have gotten to another persons inventory.<br><br>3)  He informs me that he contacted the person to whom I had traded it.<br><br>4)  He informs me that he asked for the throne back from whom I gave it to.<br><br>This is where it gets fun.  He says, and I quote.  Hell, I'll bust an image with some of the tells on it.<br><br><img src="http://www.theperfectflaw.com/picture/liar.gif"><br><br>Now, as you can see, Desilous proves to be an idiot here.  Anyone can see that if I had traded it to someone, and that person claims to have looted it, and the logs show I traded it to someone...gee, put 2 and 2 together folks, the person I accidentally gave it to through some bug is a liar.  Right?<br><br>Well, this is where it gets interesting.  I talked to Mogur some.<br><br>This is what he had to say to me.  Now remember, Mogur has given me in excess of 70K in items of value to help me finish quests.<br><br>Mogur talked to Desilous aparently earlier about what had happened.  Mogur at -no- point was -ever- asked by Desilous to give it back.  He merely explained that he had looted it and given it to me.  Anyone who has had dealings with Mogur has probably found him crude and an asshole to boot, but honest.  Mogur does not have it.  He just checked his inventory again now.  He has the other three colored thrones, but not the blue throne.<br><br>Someone here is lying.  And I, as well as all of you I'm sure, are inclined to believe Mogur and I in this, rather then Desilous who had kept going back on himself, and had accused Yasp of having it and saying something completely different to me.<br><br>Fun huh?  We have a corrupt GM.

Simply the fact he did it without you ever having filed a report means he searched through thousands and thousands of lines of text involving you making a trade. Did you thank him? The GMs on other servers may not have done that, I know I wouldn't have.<br><br>Secondly, he makes a whopping $18 / hour (in the office, not paid for their required play time) as a full time job. Promotions are possible, but there are only so many Lead Guide positions available and then where you gonna go from there? The old GM of Bertoxxolus shared an apartment with 3 other guides. They work as a GM for the love of the game as well as the experience, and frankly the pay they make isn't worth the crap players put them through.<br><br>Thirdly, stop and think. Corrupt? What the hell would he do with a blue card? He follows the rules set forth for him like all members of the Customer Service team...not to screw over the player but to help the player when they can while not jeopardizing the other players. The only people who have something to gain are yourself and possibly the people you traded to.<br><br>Fourth, GMs are required as part of their job to have an active account and play at least on a daily basis to understand the player. I am sure he has undergone similar circumstances and rather than being able to summon up the items has dealt with a GM saying no to him in the past. Keep in mind they probably understand what you are going through.<br><br>And finally, as part of the playing agreement, you are supposed to understand that there are 8 zones listed as CS Restricted Zones. These zones include Plane of Fear, Plane of Hate, Plane of Air, Veeshan's Peak, Plane of Growth, Plane of Mischief, Temple of Veeshan, Sleeper's Tomb. A CS restricted zone means that items lost from these zones are completely off limits to Apprentice Guides and only Guides+ are allowed to enter with their Server GM's permission. Furthermore, the Server GM is encouraged to simply say &quot;sorry&quot; and end any and all investigations regarding items, mobs, CRs, etc. in these zones because their difficulty and integrety must remain intact. The fact that he investigated the issue was more than he had to, and then now you don't like his ruling you are supposed to e-mail eqmail@station.sony.com to speak to his supervisor, not act like a little 2 year old and piss and moan behind his back.<br><br>Ultimately I am getting pretty tired of people pissing and moaning about guides, etc. Sure, they are never around because so many quit because the players are such pains in the ass. That is why I quit, it wasn't fun. Frankly every member of the customer service team is paid FAR LESS than the work they put out (as a guide I got $9.95 / 24 hours / month) ...that comes from their love of the game and their love of the player base. Instead of being stupid you have options such as overruling a guide's verdict by going to their supervisor instead of acting like a disgruntled child, and maybe the next time a guide says no to you, you can respect that because they are doing their job..and would love to help you if they could. <p><img src="http://eagle2.american.edu/~ch4890a/kelsig.jpg"><br><center><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/userinfo.html?char=126095">----Profile----</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ussfourgoku.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ssfourgoku</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/7/01 8:28:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=440.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: so true</span><hr size=1> hehhehe. hes nice to me. i get anythign i want. so yes its a GM overpowering his ability but hey, some people cant controll themselves. like my friend tom and ben who have to talk about my mom to make a point, go figure.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/utheperfectflaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ThePerfectFlaw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Regular Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/7/01 8:45:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=440.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.theperfectflaw.com/picture/jolly.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: so true</span><hr size=1> No offense Kelraz, but through the entire process, he treated myself an others like crap.

In that games there are two versions of the rules. The long version is many hundred pages long if we include the expansions. The short version is only two lines long.<br><br>1. The Game Master is always right.<br>2. Should the game master for once be wrong, then rule #1 automatically applies.<br><br>This works very well in a pen and paper RPG where the group is small, everyone know each other, and the GM doesn't get paid. Sadly, it seems our server GM have somehow failed the step from hobby roleplayer to customer server representive.<br><br>When he doesn't know, then he makes up some bullshit and get angry if we don't agree with it.<br><br>I have had the same problem as these guys: Delicious don't just deny requests, he make up answers (in other words, lie) and can be very rude about it.<br><br>I like to give my Iksar characters names without vowels. Lizardspeak should me a compact hiss, imho. Sadly, the name filter will not take names without vovels, it believe them to be acronyms. On Solusek Ro this was never a problem. I named my monk Hlighz, and then petitioned the flaw in the namefilter. GM Raynara showed up promptly and changed the name to Hllghz.<br><br>Recently however, I started a necro namned Mnikzz. When I petitioned to have the i removed, Delucious basically flamed me for being a stupid newbie suggesting something that is theoretically impossible. If a name have not been accepted then it is allready taken, and two chars can't have the same name, blaha blaha. Obviously, my experience and the conclusions of the Solusek Ro GMs meant nothing compared to his authority. Game mechanics are whatever he decide they are, and just like a pen and paper GM he don't have to check the rulebook unless he feels like it. <p>Love, Edeina<br>Highelf Arch Mage of Erollisi.<br>Citizen of <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero">Ayonae Ro</a>, member of <a href="http://www.eternalwrath.net">Eternal Wrath</a>.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ushamanpimp.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shamanpimp</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/7/01 9:43:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=440.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.amishrakefight.org/gfy/finger1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Desilous the Corrupt, Lead GM of Ayonae Ro.</span><hr size=1> 1) I was never asked whether i currently had the card by Desilous.<br>2) I was never asked to return a card to Desilous.<br>3) I only had 1 conversation with Desilous, which was the night of the occurrance in a raid in Velketor.... none of these occurrances that took place between the 3 of us were in a CS Restricted zone.<br>4) The card could not have been bugged to an extraneous slot in my inventory.

After looking for about 30 seconds, i cancel the trade with him, and continue buffing for the raid.

Flame all you want about PoM farming, it takes a minimum of 4 to 6 thrones to make one piece of class armor (2 to 4 to get a random class box/junk item/nothing (10% chance to your class's box), and 2 for each piece of wearable armor template... which is very similar ToV armor farming of armor templates and armor gems that numerous guilds on the server do.    I can personally solo the each of the throne dropping mobs. I find it fun due to being able to solo them, and I share the rewards with my guild. <p>_____________________________<BR><a href=http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=68755> Mogur Bloodbear</a><BR><br><a href=http://www.casus-belli.net> Casus Belli</a><br></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=440.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=440.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=440.topic&start=61&stop=71>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showPrevMessage?topicID=440.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showNextMessage?topicID=440.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=440.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=440.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.threadControl?topicID=440.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=440.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=440.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Diplomacy Corner<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Administration Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6>NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
