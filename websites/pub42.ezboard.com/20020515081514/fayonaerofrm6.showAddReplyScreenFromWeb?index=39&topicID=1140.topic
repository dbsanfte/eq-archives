<br>
Yeah, and if you snuck a peek at your friend's Playboy magazine at age seven, that's just a gateway device to harder and harder porn.  Hell, before you know it you're at the county morgue sodomizing a cold body.  Give me a fucking break.  I know I haven't had the urge to "crack open a cold one", and I do recall seeing a pornographic movie at a friend's party once when I was 15.<br>
<br>
As far as drugs go?  Do it man, legalize them ALL.  Let those with no self-control end up dead, and that's less people for me to have to contend with.  I'm all for it, and not just for the population reducing benefits either.  If I wanted to stay up a few days straight to study, I can go visit my local tweak store and keep a moderate and steady stream of meth going to ace that exam.  If I have problems sleeping, go grab some muscle relaxants and pain-killers.  Ever wonder why doctors are so against the legalization of drugs?  It's not because they give a flying fuck about their patients (some do, but I don't think that the Hippocratic Oath is taken seriously by more than 10% of all doctors)...if they gave a shit they'd not go around leaving surgical instruments, cutting out the wrong organs, and charging you out the ass.  <br>
<br>
It's about <b>control</b> and <b>money</b> here people.  If drugs were legalized, you think that it would just be recreational drugs?  Hell no, people could get the same shit that it takes a doctor to get now.  No more control over patients in many respects, and no more easy $65.00, 30 minute visits where they give the same goddamned antibiotic that they always give out.  Yeah, drug legalization is a scary prospect for doctors because they lose out on a large amount of money.  <br>
<br>
What does this mean to me?  It ain't EVER gonna happen, because as we all know the lobbyists will make sure that congress is well fed by way of the doctors...ultimately by way of you, and your loved ones.  Do this world a service and kick an MD in the crotch...then tell him, "Fix that.  Asshole." spit on him and drive off happy.  *dreams*  Ahhh, if only there weren't such things as assault and battery charges. <p>Faust<BR>

<br>
My opinions are basaed on personal experiances and watching many of my friends, and myself, fall into drugs and the paths that led us there... not on case studies and surveys.  I was smoking weed for about 6 months before i touched a cigarette.  The first time I started drinking as a means of escaping reality was 4 months after I stopped my heavy drug abuse... about 6 years after i started smoking weed.<br>
<br>
Every case is different.<br>
<br>
In any case, however it is any of you all escape reality by using a substance of some sort... just be safe and smart about it.<br>

And there in lies the rub. Personal experience is no substitute for empirical data. That is why science relies on peer-reviewed, controlled, and repeatable studies – and not Uncle Joe’s drunken ramblings about the time he got slashed with a box-cutter while trying to buy “crank” from a guy named “Chain-Gang” in the toilet stall of the strip club out on Old Route 55. <br>
<br>
If I were to ask you the basis for your personal knowledge of the alleged "Gateway" effect - you would likely produce a handful, at best, of truly horrific stories of personal tragedy involving friends, friends-of-friends, or family, that went from trying pot at a High School party – to meeting a grizzly end in some skid-row hotel room with a hypodermic needle full of talcum powder cut with cleaning products sticking out of their emaciated, and excessively tattooed, arm.<br>
<br>
That is human nature. We see the worst-case scenarios, and by virtue of our fear of them, we distort their probability until they seem the norm – when in fact, they are the statistical anomalies.<br>
It’s rather like the way people live in fear of horrific airline disasters - when they are actually far more likely to die during the drive to the airport. <br>
<br>
The fact is - for every personal experience you can relate where marijuana lead someone down the slippery slope to an ignoble “junkies death" - you are ignoring the <b>hundreds</b> of long-time, casual marijuana users you work, study, play, and otherwise interact with <I>every single day</I>. You are fooling yourself if you don’t think there are marijuana users teaching you and/or your children, delivering your mail, policing your streets, ringing up your groceries, fixing your car, treating your illnesses, cooking your meals, writing that book your reading, composing that music your listening to, etc, etc, etc. <br>
Where the hell do you think all those hippies went? They didn’t <I>all</I> die in ‘Nam.<br>
<br>
 Even the anti-legalization “studies” indicate that there are millions and millions of casual marijuana users in society, and yet, where are all the emergency room overdoses these people should be creating as they move through the “Gateway”? The records show that emergency room visits related to drugs have been steadily declining since the mid-1970s.<br>
<br>
<blockquote type=cite><blockquote><hr>"I am willing to bet though if someone else took the time they could come up with equally as many quotes to oppose those. "<hr></blockquote></blockquote><br>
<br>
Well, I can save you some money. You don’t need to bet…NORML has already done it for you. Since 1985, the National Organization to Repeal Marijuana Laws has had $50,000.00 on the table for the first study, “to withstand normal scientific peer review”, that proves the “Gateway Theory”. No one has ever claimed it.<br>
<br>
The fact of the matter is, only three (3) formal reports have ever claimed a factual existence to the “Gateway Theory” – and not a one of them offered ANY scientific studies to back their claim that such a phenomenon existed.<br>
Two made use of <I>theoretical</I> mathematical analysis of <B>other</B> studies, and one contained the <I>hypothesis</I> of one (1) medical doctor – with no (0) clinical studies.<br>
<br>
I know this all sounds very “X-Files”. I am sure you are asking yourself why the government would go through all the trouble of creating and hyping these bogus studies, and other propaganda, if they weren’t true. Well, since you asked…<br>
<br>
As the “Cold War” thawed – the powers that be had to create a new boogey-man…and they did…<B>The Drug War</b>. I believe even they were probably surprised at what an amazing cash cow this next generation Civil War became. The money is so good – they don’t even care that it has already claimed more than twice as many lives as the Viet-Nam war, and put a higher percentage of this countries citizens behind bars than any other country in the world – at any time in human history. The old Soviet gulags had nothing on us.<br>
<br>
Okay, rereading this I realize I am clearly rambling, and may in fact be turning into Riotgirl. I am going to quit while I am ahead. To sum up quickly…<br>
<br>
Drug War = Bad. <br>
Freedom and Choice = Good.<br>

Weed should be legalized.  Most other drugs are trouble.  Weed is all natural and can't kill you.  Sure smoke and shit can hurt you, but as with anything moderation is the key.  People *can* smoke weed and not be stoners.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6>NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
