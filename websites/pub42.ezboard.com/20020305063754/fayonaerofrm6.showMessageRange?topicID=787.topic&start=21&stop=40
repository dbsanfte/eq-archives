- I thought this would be a prety relating thread to the general EQ population. I even got a couple of /tells in game lately saying that as soon as they saw the thread, they tried to make their better halves/friends read it to understand what was happening. <br>
We all know EQ is time consuming, more so than a hell of a lot of things in life. And like it or not, the Outsider_01 will never understand why or how we devote so much of our life to it. They will see it as 'waisting your life on a computer game', while we'll see it as having fun and doing just another social activity. <br>
<br>
'I think more about my ex girlie than EQ. We're not insane '<br>

- I hope - no, I think - you're right <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  We're not insane. But surely enough to the Outsider_01, we will appear to be at times. 'Won't stop playing a game in order to come round and watch a movie?!? Just Hit Pause (tm)!' <br>
We'll hear it, they'll say it. Unless they ever succom to the ravages and seductive grip of EverQuest, I fear that this will be a general feeling, or friction, between the EverQuest player, and the Outsider_01 forever.<br>

I really got a chuckle at the mention of golf.

Good [first] post. As an addendum to that post, another misinterpretation by non-EQ'ers is that EQ completely dominates <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> every</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> aspect of our lives by <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> replacing</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> other forms of interaction and entertainment.<br>
<br>
There is the automatic presumption that EQ <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> must</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> replace other forms of social interaction rather than sitting quite nicely alongside them. I myself work, have a full and varied social life, have various hubs and networks of friends, a range of other pursuits and interests of which, EQ is but one. <br>
<br>
Now I may spend x hours on EQ compared to y activity, but EQ is not at the expense or exclusion of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> all</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of my other activities. However, EQ or any other related phenomena is a convenient scapegoat, especially when backed up with pseudo-scientific evidence to lay all manner of social evils at its door.<br>

<br>
Get known for scheduling time, as in, whenever ANYone asks you to do anything unscheduled, say, &quot;hm, no, sorry, i can't do that right now, can we pencil it in at xxxx (where xxxx is some time later), i've scheduled THIS time with 5 (or 10 or 40) other people online at the moment&quot;  Do this whether you are playing everquest or not.<br>
<br>
And schedule time with your rl friends.  Schedule time to be on eq.  When your rl friends barge in on you when you are playing eq you can UP TRUMP THEM with the schedule card!<br>
<br>
Because as everyone knows, people who write lists and schedule their time are successful!  And while people can't understand why you schedule so much eq time, they feel comfortable that you will eventually pencil them in. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucaeanthepaladin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CaeanthePaladin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/9/02 4:23:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=787.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re:</span><hr size=1> the bottom line is that while you certainly can have real friends in EQ, do you really want to be on your death bed and remember that time you helped 40 computer generated avatars of real people kill a computer generated dragon, or would you prefer remembering the time you had lunch with your mom.<br>
<br>
Pretend that tomorrow all the people who may have tried to get your attention while you play EQ are gone. Would you have acted differently?<br>
<br>
In many cases I would wager that people play EQ as a buffer from these real life encounters...an excuse if you will for not having to deal with the day to day crap we're all forced to stomach.<br>
<br>
Now you can make the argument that anything we do can be held up to the same standard -- from going to a movie, to watching TV, to going for a walk, to even going to work or school. However, the main difference is that to be &quot;successful&quot; in EQ requires large chunks of dedicated time. You are effectively penalized if your play style is short times of play as you need time to get people together, get to a target, clear to it etc. <br>
<br>
If you want to go see a movie or do something else, you just pick the activity and go. It may take 3 hours from start to finish or more, but you're not facing severe situational penalties for changing your plans or having to deal with other people's needs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uhalochanter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HaloChanter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local Resident</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/9/02 5:57:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=787.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: *yawns* I present the ever-repeated debate..[Long]</span><hr size=1> CaeanthePaladin..

While I see to try and justify EverQuest in my earlier posts as just another activity, albeit social or entertaining, it is something greater than both. It takes a larger amount of time and effort, and requires you to sacrifice time in our lives to be successful at it.<br>
However, you suggested whether or not we would like to remember a time on EQ, or a time in RL, when on our death bed. So let me ask, wouldn't that be the same for anything? I mean, someone who plays football very frequently. Wouldn't you tell them to get a grip.. I mean what would they rather remember on their death bed, the time they had lunch with their mum, or the time they helped a bunch of sweaty men kick a ball in a net? <p>Halo 56th Beguiler<br>

Everquest is to social what masturbating is to sex.  EQ tricks you into thinking it can provide all the social interaction you need, but it just can't.  You can jerk off for days and weeks and months, but eventually you just have to get laid.  You can't live on bread alone, and for all you that run eq as your sole form of human &quot;contact&quot;...it's really not enough.  <br>
<br>
I know a certain SK in real life...we go out to grab dinner or something....and its EQ EQ EQ..Ehrnam interjects something not EQ...EQ EQ EQ...repeat, EQ EQ EQ.  We share mutual friends that bitch incesantly that there is nothing else she wants to ever talk about.  That's not healthy NOR is it uncommon.<br>
<br>
The time and dedication that I/we all spend playing this game is the type that could take us all to the olympic games.  If we took the energy we're focusing on fake frogs and dragons and applied it to RL we could be immensely wealthy, carry an adonis like physique, or change the world.  The comparisons to people watching TV or playing Golf aren't valid either, as anyone would agree that a person doing either of those things for 6-10hours EVERY day has issues.  <br>
<br>
Posting this in a forum full of your fellow geeks will net you the positive, agreeable responses you were looking for.  Not everything RL people tell you about the game is bunk though.<br>

- No my American friend, it is Football. The only nation in the world to call Football, Soccer.. is America. Why? Because they invent a game long after traditional football, well I say invent.. they merely 'made over' rugby, yet contributed an additional ton of padding to protect themselves. Anyway, back to my point. Ah yes, they create American 'Football' where numerous players run with an odd shaped thing in their HANDS.. and call it football. However, FOOTBALL (soccer) consists of 22 players KICKING a ball around a pitch. <br>
So no bud, it isn't soccer. It's called FOOTBALL.<br>

Substitute EQ for any other activity that someone is deeply addicted to. Yep, it is not uncommon, but only seems to be non-socially acceptable when applied to a computer game.<br>
<br>
I have a low tolerance level for people who have one topic of conversation, and all the depth of a puddle. EQ or not EQ.<br>

It's not acceptable any of those times, it's merely understood in other situations.  &quot;Car guys&quot; who work on their ride 24/7 and do nothing but talk engines and horsepower are equally looked down upon should they go spouting off around non-motorheads in public...people just understand the fundamentals of what they are talking about.  As opposed to EQ talk, where as mundanes haven't a clue about the most basic elements of the conversation. (and a decent portion of EQers SEEM to be socially devoid enough not to realize this)<br>
