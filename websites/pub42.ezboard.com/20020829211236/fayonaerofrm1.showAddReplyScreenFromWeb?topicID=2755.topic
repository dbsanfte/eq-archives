<br>
Married, kids, full time job.  If I get 2 hours on in the morning before I go to work, that's a good day.  A little more on weekends sometimes, and a couple evenings a week for maybe an hour or two. <br>
<br>
It's a different game.  I won't ever join a big guild, because I can't raid, because I'm never on long enough at one time.  I probably won't ever guild at all because I don't see any reason to.  <br>
<br>
I'd like to hear how other's experiences compare to mine and what your approach is. <br>
<br>
I work hard at maximizing the benefit of my time.  I spent a lot of time up front making money from selling leather paddings and backpacks so I could buy equipment for my main, and I still work at making money for upgrades.  I'm an equipment junkie - always trying to figure out where I can get the most benefit for my plat, and always trying to figure the most time efficient way to make plat. <br>
<br>
My main's a 49 warrior who soloed most of that, but still groups enough to keep the skills up.  Fungi tunic, of course - that's the only thing that makes it possible, but I carry decent taunt weapons as well.  I solo the lowest dark blues I can find when I'm levelling.  I don't worry much about AC (900ish) cause it's just not that important for what I'm doing. <br>
<br>
I'll never know the game as well as the best of the hardcore players, but I have a theory - if you have a 50ish plus casual player, you've probably got someone who is pretty knowledgeable - someone who is very unlikely to be a total doofus and/or jerk about playing. <br>
<br>
I'd like to hear opinions about that.  I'd like to hear from the other casual players - I'd especially like to hear from anyone else who's mostly gone it alone.  I'd like to know who the highest level casual players are. <br>

I would consider myself as a active addict, spend all spare time on Eq. Currently having my room painted and floors sanded w/ a new polish on it and every second sitting at home drooling every second  as i wait for the days where i can play EQ 24/7. Good thing its the summber because when the end of school came, i regret appling to a guild, i wasnt able to play much, like yourself, i was studying or else i can't play over the summer. <br>
<br>
I agree someone around lvl 55 should have as well knowledge as a hardcore player. Butthe hardcore player would know more about tactics and the certain way of killing certain mobs. Also some Hardcore players might know more than another hardocre player. I think you would learn more from the experiences you get from killing High lvl NPC's. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=267282>Talari Iralat

I'd say I'm a casual player.  I occasionally play a LOT of hours - that's usually a good way to tell that work is driving me insane.  Then I'll hit a spot like now; between work, vacation, and computer problems I've played probably 2 hours in the last 3 weeks.  <br>
<br>
I'd like to average at least 10 to 15 hours a week.   Tell you what, though, the time spent LFG drives me nuts.   Doesn't help that I'm addicted to dungeons.   <p>Mirdorr, 42 bard, Ayonae Ro

<br>
Married, kids, full-time job... I think I managed about 26 hours in a week..but that was the most ever.  A typical week (though I am currently on a break...less than 2 hours) would be something like 10-16 hours.  About 2 or 3 weekday nights , late (after I put the kids to sleep) and about 4 or 5 hours, late on one or both weekend nights.<br>
<br>
EQ is not built for the casual player to be successful..post 50.  To be successful post-50, you pretty much have to join a large guild and raid 4+ nights a week for 6+ hours...ie., make EQ your full time job :')<br>
<br>
Now this, of course assumes you are defining successful as getting &quot;uber&quot; lewt.  If you define it differently, as I do (and have too) as making friends and having fun while I play, then it's a whole new ball of wax....you can be sucessful in many different ways.<br>
<br>
My highest character is 52 and was, until recently, a member of a large guild.  I would really suggest getting into a guild, maybe not a large raid type, but maybe casual &quot;friend&quot; guild...guilds rock (assuming you get in a good guild).  I left this guild because it was a large raiding guild and the want to join them was driving me nuts.  I knew it was futile to raid with hours and amount of time I could devote..and felt left out allot....but man, they were a great bunch of peeps and good friends!!<br>
<br>
As far as being post-50 and not a total dufus...I consider myself a great in solo, good in groups and a very novice raider...but still a complete doofus :')<br>

Most of us are parents, and until recently (the recession in the IT industry has hit us hard), all of us had jobs <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  It's entirely possible to be a very good player, even if you only play twice a week or so for a few hours; having a regular group of folks to group with regularly, and try new strategies and zones, helps a great deal in this regard.  It also allows you to hit some great mid level zones that aren't playable unless you 'bring your own group', especially dungeons.  While one might learn a lot about the game over 50 levels mostly soloing, so much of the game mechanics revolve around grouping, that I do believe that you are 'missing' a big part of the EQ experience by not grouping and developing the skills associated with it.<br>
<br>
But everyone defines the game, and what constitutes being a ''success' in it, in their own terms.  In my opinion, it is entirely possible to have a 'successful' and rewarding EQ 'career', as it were, as a casual player.  My suggestion is to find a group of folks who share your gameplay tempo and interests, and find some things to work on together, whether it's tradeskills, dungeon crawling, or quests.  There are quite a few 'family size' and a few larger, guilds built of casual players, and who won't care a whit that you can't raid 3 nights a week; they're in it for the company and the adventure.  In our case, while we will never make it to HoT or Dragon Necropolis or Vex Thal as a guild, we have found the Luclin Twilight quests to be very rewarding from both an experience and an item standpoint, as well as something that folks could help out with when they were playing by themselves. <br>
<br>
Best of luck with your game experience; and I'd suggest not giving upon the guild issue altogether.  A good 'family style' guild allows the casual player to make the most out of his limited time in the game, by  providing some ready company, grouping opportunities, and help with quests, etc.<br>

<br>
I'm a casual player because I tend to get bored easily. I could never spend more than 3 hours on EQ, because I'd find it too tedious. I suppose I get the most enjoyment out of interacting with the other players. I don't have much of a desire to level up as fast as possible, and acquiring money or equipment is not too important. In saying that, though, I have a 41 Warrior and a 35 Bard, but as I get into the higher levels, the rewards vs. time put in are too far apart for me. <br>
<br>
I know that I'll never reach level 60, nor will I get my Epic. I don't mind. As long as I'm having fun with whatever time I put in, I'll be satisfied with whatever level my character is. <p>

A lot of my game enjoyment is goal/achievement oriented - I enjoy the challenge of having to sometimes figure out a different path to get where I want to go.  <br>
<br>
I know the post 50 game is normally a big change, but I just don't really have the opportunity or inclination to follow that path.  I soloed initially to level faster, then had shifted my goals at one point to become more group oriented.  But I foresee that grouping on a limited (and unpredictable) playing schedule is going to get harder and harder as I go up in levels. Walking into High Keep (for example), joining a group for an hour and then leaving is not a big deal.  Doing the same thing in Sebilis is just not going to work out very often.  So it's back to soloing as much out of necessity as desire. <br>
<br>
Ideally, I would love to find a partner with the same playing schedule as I have;  but even that would probably not work out as I cannot guarantee that I'll be on every day at the same time. <br>
<br>
I'd like to get to 60 but probably never will; I'd like to get as close as I can, at least.   Now, if I did make it, I'd be a fairly useless lvl 60 warrior as far as raiding and equipment go, but I will have enjoyed myself, so I can't really see that it makes a lot of difference.  I'll never see the inside of ToV or a lot of other places, but I'll still have fun.  If I get bored, I'll start another character and go back through the lower levels again in zones that I miss, or places I didn't experience the first time around. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm a casual player because I tend to get bored easily&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm with you on that too.  Even when I have more time available, I've usually about had it after 2 or 3 hours.  If I could ever find out when the Naggy/Vox raids are held, I might make an effort to block out a bigger chunk of time for that, but that's about the only reason I would at this point. <br>
<br>
As to guilds - I was in an 'adult' guild on the server I moved from - everyone had kids and most of us were over 40 (in age).  Guild chat turned into a flirt-fest, which I frankly found to be pretty ludicrous for a bunch of married adults.   And despite the avowed casual nature of the guild, the leadership was still constantly pushing for people to gain levels, trying to recruit certain classes, work on epics, etc.  Maybe it was just a bad experience but it's one which I'm not anxioius to repeat.  <br>
<br>
And, I really don't know at this point whether I'll be playing tomorrow morning or tomorrow night, let alone this Friday at 8:00 p.m.  So I don't want to be in the position of having to commit to planned events.  I've got enough commitments in RL - I play this game to escape all that. <br>
<br>
One of my goals is to continue to be good at my job - a good grouping tank. I fear that I will not be able to keep that up very much longer, but I don't see much way around it.<br>
<br>
I appreciate the replies - I always like to hear how different people approach and play the game.  If any of you ever see me online, feel free to send me a tell.

By one definition, I'm a casual player, but I log as many hours as a lot of the most hardcores do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ujexmann.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jexmann</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/9/02 9:06:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2755.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.DuskEternal.org/images/gorron.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Casual Players</span><hr size=1> Its funny how people define themselves. I play EQ anywhere from 20-40 hours a week, and have always considered myself a casual player because I have a full time job, spouse and kids. Some of my friends look at me and think, dang you sure play a lot, and then I look at some of my friends in game and think, dang they sure play a lot.<br>

I consider myself a casual player<br>
and after 3 years  my main is a lvl 58 ranger and my 2nd box alt is a lvl 54 cleric. Most of this time is late at night when most folks are asleep.<br>
<br>
With a full time job, wife, 4 kids (all girls 14, 9, 7, 4) I almost never get a chance to raid or find<br>
time to play longer then 3 hours. Currently we are adding an 800 sq ft. extention to the house<br>
(5 women and one bathroom is NOT [I repeat] NOT ideal) so there is a lot of different RL interruptions<br>
to deal with. For most raids I have to negotiate with wife for time and/or<br>
arrange a babysitter for the kids. <br>
<br>
Casual is ok but I doubt I will ever get the time to see the really high end parts of the game. I just<br>
don't have the RL time to do the Serious Encounter/loot up cycle that would let me go.<br>

<br>
There are times I play a lot.  -- this usually occurs about the time my spouse is coaching a sport and is away from home for a good part of the eves.  I have, however, seen some hardcore gamers' lives fall apart around them because of their playing habit.  Is it just a game?  I try to temper my playing time because I don't want to risk losing that which matters the most to me -- my husband, my kids, my family and my Job. <br>
<br>
There are times I play very little.  -- such as now when everyone is home over the summer.  (my spouse is a teacher and I am a school nurse, so we are all home during summer break).  My play times occur during the morning hours when the census on the server is probably at its lowest, and everyone at home is still asleep.   <br>
<br>
I have played the high end game somewhat and have found it extremely vicious, but also enjoyable at times.  <br>
<br>
But when push comes to shove, yes. I am a casual player.  I think I am glad of that. <p><center><img src="http://www.dragonsong.org/graphics/cara.jpg"><p>"The bonds of friendship are forged in laughter, but cemented in tears"</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/umoonbound.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Moonbound</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Journeyman</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/10/02 2:06:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2755.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Casual Players</span><hr size=1> I consider myself a casual player, and my warrior is almost 58.

I am fairly happy with my equipment, and once i hit 60 and get some AA points, I will work on tradeskills. Its a fun game on many different levels, and I have found the most enjoyable thing right now for me is to make friends and relax when online. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

It also helps when you have RL buddies in the game - <br>
