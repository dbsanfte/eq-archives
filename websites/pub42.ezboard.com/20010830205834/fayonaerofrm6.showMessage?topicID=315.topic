I had lots of respect for DW, and still have it for some but lost it for some as well!<br>
<br>
Explanation:<br>
<br>
We head into seb and move to Disco, DW members there are Holding D1 and D2, we all know that these are 2 seperate camps.<br>
They are fighting in D1 so we move to D2.<br>
Once we are in D2 the strange thing happens..<br>
<br>
Thorgal starts pulling mobs from D2 camp.<br>
So after a while we get fed up with that and I use Oger illusion and Brisnuc is a Big as bear, we sit at D2 entrance so at least we can kill our own mobs without them pulling them.<br>
<br>
So Thorgal shrinks himselfs, runs to Brogg and pulls him.<br>
We try to stunn it and keep it but Svara is a Rogue with huge damage output and kills it.<br>
They continue this and mess up our camp.<br>
We zoned out.<br>
<br>
Here are 2 images where you see Svara fighting in our D2 camp and Kikur looting in our D2 camp.<br>
<p><br>
<img src="http://www.eqmatahari.nl/images/svara.jpg"><br><br>
<img src="http://www.eqmatahari.nl/images/kikur.jpg"><p><br>
We tried charming the mobs even tried to pull their mobs as well but in the end we just got sick and tired of it and gated out.<br>
<br>
I nice performance on how an Uber Guilds members can act like some ignorant people.<br>
<br>
Sorry for DW as a Guild but this was a pathetic display on how not to solve a camp issue.<br>

<br>
because one simple tell and a bit of communication could have solved the whole thing. according to your post you didn't try to talk to them. you rather try to charm mobs and use oger illusion to sit in the way. c'mon this is ridiculous. honestly.<br>

<br>
It do seem like a breakdown of communication, rather then either side being mean on purpouse.<br>
<br>
If I understand the situation right, one group was camping/pulling two spawns. Another group didn't like that, and took one of them, the one that the first group wasn't sitting at. First group tried to take it back. Both groups used force instead of reason. Sounds like a all too commun situation, IMHO. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

When we came down they claimed both camps.<br>
<br>
Since everyone knows that in the every day exp dugeons you keep 1 camp and not 2 (or at least have presence in both camps (which they didn't)).<br>
We then proceeded to D2 since they had D1.<br>
<br>
They then proceeded to pull from D2 when asked not to and laughed at us.<br>
They then proceeded to pull the named ones out of D2 while we were fighting (means they pulled stright through us).<br>
<br>
I mean seriously we even had to Enjarge ourselfs trying to block them out and they decided to shrink pass through us and pull Brogg while we in Midst battle.<br>
<br>
Communcation error or not this was a very bad way of showing how you solve this.<br>
Instead when we used /ooc to say they can't hold 2 camps all they did was being ignorant.<br>
So when we entered and saw them have D1 we took D2.<br>
No presence in a camp means you have no camp.<br>
<br>
I don't think I need to explain to anyone that to have a camp you have to be in a camp.<br>
Fact: they were not in D2<br>
Fact: when we were they started pulling our camp<br>
Fact: when we asked them to stop they laughed at us<br>
Fact: when we tried to block em they did everything they could to steal our named mobs.<br>
Fact: they stole our named mobs out of camp while we were fighting.<br>
<br>
<br>
Communication has nothing to do with this, this was plain rude behaviour.<br>

Yea right, I bet you got that from the EQ manual. Just because you cannot take that area with your group doesn't mean someone else cannot. Why are you moving to a camp that's called in camp check? Afaik this was today morning (european) = very few people in Sebilis. And there are enough other camps.<br>
<br>
However there is still the option /tell and asking to share the area if you are after a certain drop.<br>
You had better invested your energy in some diplomacy instead of trying tactics to force getting the camp and taking screenshots so you can post about the big bad uber guild that killstealed your sebilis camp. Ridiculous.<br>
<br>
You tried charming the mobs and even tried to pull from their camp.. wtf is this? You are doing the same thing as you are complaining about?<br>
<br>
Grow up and learn to solve problems personally.<br>
And no, I still like Matahari because I know some really nice people. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Edit: As I just heard Thorgal even announced that they would take D2 then and leave D1 to Ytrok's group. (instead of camping d1+d2) <p><img src="http://www.camsky.de/scorpus.gif">

As your group came we figthed 3 mob in D1 u see us figthing d1 and thinking we camp it ? U are wrong we just figth there we shouted 30 secs after we killed our 3 mobs in ooc that we will take d2 and u can have d1. YOU not us stealed the camp WE was camping d1/d2 and WE decided togo to d2 but YOU ninjad into d2 and called it camped. SO YOU stolen OUR camp not we yours. We decidet to pull from d2 too because of your rudeness to steal our camp. YOU started to charm our pulls and tryed to ks (in case thet u cant KS me !).

<br>
As I said we did a camp check and they said Disco 1 and 2 I said that you can not camp 2 camps.<br>
So when we got there they were pulling D1<br>
<br>
This was not pulling away mobs that were in the way, they were pulling that camp, so that is actually different.<br>
<br>
So we moved to D2 full spawn on all accounts in D2<br>
<br>
Now you can discuss if it was fair to Take D2 or not.<br>
But that does not change the fact that we entered a non camped camp ..<br>
Does not change the fact that they pulled out of our camp<br>
Does not change the fact that they Shrunk theirselfes to pass us and pull Brogg through our camp<br>
<br>
The charming I did was to pull back the mobs they pulled out of D2.<br>
I charmed the seb Golems if you know D1 and 2 you know the golems that spawn in library and brogg room and in the hall to D2<br>
<br>
Those I charmed.<br>
<br>
And Ostiary also btw<br>
<br>
As I said they did not give me a tell either saying hey man we would like D2 please here is D1 and let us take D2<br>
<br>
As I said we entered an Uncamped Full Spawn camp<br>
<br>
So please ..<br>
<br>
You can bend it any way you like you can try to point anywhere you like and no this has nothing to do with Matahari and it does have nothing to do with DW.<br>
It does have to do with the fact that the DW members pulled out of our camps and only DW members.<br>
<br>
I understand you are defending them , but their actions no matter if we should have asked like"please can we have D1 or 2 since you are camping two spots we would really appreciate your generousity to let us have 1 of these camps".<br>
They pulled out of our camp through us while we were fighting, pulled our named spawns while we fighting in the hallway!<br>
<br>
Sorry .. can't make it look better any way you try to.<br>
<br>
Oh an Svara read your text carefully...<br>
You state you were fighting in D1, we moved into D2 and after you killed D1 mobs you say in ooc we can have D1 and you take D2...<br>
Read that text a couple times and tell me what camp we stole again please.<br>

In Guk do you take agi when a group is taking Lord/AM? they are perfectly reasonable 1 group camps and only when the place was VERY busy did people through kindness give up one of the rooms. Early bird catches thw worm and all that. If a group is camping bar and armorer do you take 1 and claim they seperate camps? they had no reason to have to hand you one of the camps if they felt they didn't want to and could hold them both, and yet they said you could have D1 and they would take D2 but you still went and took D2 while they were fighting D1 mobs. IMO you camp stole and were totally in the wrong, seb is a big place and there are other places to go if it happens to be full, just because they don't happen to drop the exact ph4+ l3W+z you require is no reason to bitch and moan because you're group was incapable of holdin a spot the group already there could. <p><A HREF="http://interealms.com/profiles/profile.cfm?ID=9924" TARGET=_blank>Kalaar Kururuc</A> <BR>

<br>
If you can handle &quot;both&quot; and i say that loosley, camps, then you have &quot;both&quot; camps. What you did was inconsiderate and rude.<br>
I often camp the two discos at once, and put up with this alot...a group just walks in, and takes a camp, or claims the camp, sometimes without even saying a word.<br>
You know what I do? keep pulling as before....afterall..i got all the mobs timed and can still efficenctly pull them as they pop, well rudegroup01 doesnt have that info.<br>
No matter how you try to justify it Ytrok, you *were* in the wrong. <br>
you made an agressive claim, and they responded in like, *you*(or your group more accuratly) initiated the conflict, where one wasnt required, and therefore are the agressor and are responsable for any repercussions of those actions.<br>
<br>
Now....before you respond...i'll take a shot in the dark and guess your next defense<br>
<br>
&quot;d2 was at full spawn&quot;<br>
<br>
You were not there prior to the conflict, and therefore do not know the situation, d2 may have been popping just as you were getting there.<br>
A group does not nesscarily have to pull everything as it spawns, my personal definition of handling both camps is if at one point or another in the 25min or so period, all mobs have died, but you could not have possably known wether or not that was the case, and therefore &quot;d2 was at full spawn&quot; is not a proper defense...<br>

If going by what you said,then a group could be camping the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> entire zone of sebilis</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> if they had the power to pull and handle all the camps in the zone. (yes,I know that isn't possible,I'm using it as an example)<br>

I don't see how you can be camping something if you are not physically in the camp. <p>Wliten Arcanum<br>

DW obciously couldnt keep up with all of the spawns, or otherwise the incoming group would see nothing to kill and move along... but apparently dw could kill enough to make the 2nd group's killing not worthwhile, so the 2nd group commenced whining about it.<br>

if you have a 60 shaman and a 60 rogue, AND others sitting in 'D1'... ya, youre not gonna find much to kill. <p>_____________________________<BR>

They were clearly able to handle the Disco, or the vast majority of it, so you came in to slow both them and you down and now whine about it when you should have gone to another camp.  <br>

A camp is a camp, and if you're camping a camp, you're camping a camp. But who decides what's a camp? The campers that camp the camp or the people who would like to come camp the camp?<br>
