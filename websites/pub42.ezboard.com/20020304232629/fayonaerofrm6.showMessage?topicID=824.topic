Is the ever increasing gaming content unbalancing the player base of EverQuest?<br>
Is it destroying THE game of Everquest? To interact with your fellow hunters, to talk, to group, to laugh? Has EverQuest become just one type of game? The high end game?<br>
To the casual person, more and more expansions mean the initiation of more and more players in to the world of EverQuest, but this just isn't so. Sure, sales increase, mainly to accomodate the existing player base, but obviously the player base increases in itself. But does it enough? <br>
To me, the expansions are just wearing the world thin. Where there were 12 people in Zone A, there will then be 6 people in Zone A, and then 6 people in the new Zone B. And so forth and so on.<br>
On top of that, it is increasingly clear that the bulk of players congreate towards the 'easy road' to 60. The outside route. <br>
So, board, let me know what you think. Does Verant need to concentrate on existing content, or keep on expanding, until it will take 10 zones to find another player, instead of 8. <p>Halo 57th Beguiler<br>

<br>
That's a big part of the problem, but another part has more simply to do with the age of the game and the ratio of experienced to new players.  By and large, people who have already levelled to 60 the 'hard' way, in the first year and some that the game was out, quite understandably don't want to dungeon crawl their way up again with second and third (and beyond) alts.  Getting exp in outdoor zones is easy, folks who have already levelled up don't need the mid-level loot out of dungeons (or if they want it they can send their heavy hitter in to farm it, or buy it at rediculously low prices), and so why not relax and grind your way up to 50 pulling to the ledge in OT/DL etc?  <br>
<br>
So what happens when new players come into the game, and start trying to find out where the 'action' is, they find the vast majority of people at their level (but not level of game playing experience) in the outdoor zones, and so that is where they end up going for groups.  The situation has gradually progressed to the point that the ratio of new to experienced low level players is so low, that inexperienced players have a difficult time even *finding* each other, much less finding several folks of like minds who want to explore the game...<br>
<br>
Our little guild finally made it into Droga last weekend (after our detour to the burynai mining camp and Nurga last week).  It literally took us all night (10 pm to 6 am) to make the loop to the Chief room and back, but we had a fabulous time, 4 of the 8 people on the trip dinged, and we got some nice items (including a Shroud of Nature and a Goblin Backstabber).  They were all floored by the sheer size of the place and the great variety of casting mobs there; our necro nearly got the party wiped several times when she 'let' the pet get ahead of the party, but all in all we had a great time, and they learned a *lot*.  At one point, about 4 hours into the trip, our SK said: &quot;Wow, I wonder how many people even know this exists...&quot;.  She, and our necro, had *never* seen the inside of a dungeon before except for Paw when we found them, in their mid 30s, and they're both intelligent adults who interact well with others, but they had simply been going where the 'action' was... <br>
<br>
So the end result is that newer players to the game *don't* have the same experiences that those who came to the game when it was newer had, and have a harder and harder time finding people to interact with who aren't 'jaded' about the low-mid level game, just racing through it to get to where the 'real' game is, and disdainful of the quests and loot available at that level.  This gets communicated very quickly to younger players, who quickly adopt the same attitude.  I can't say that I know what the solution is, but clearly, just adding more (overwhelmingly outdoor) zones *isn't* it...<br>
<br>
I think the best solution that I have seen so far, which Verant tried this summer and then seems to have abandoned, is to have the existing zones have a 'history' and change over time, as was done with Lfay and befallen (and to a lesser extent to the karanas) over the summer.  The 'newspaper' concept was also a great one (which also appears to have died, there hasn't been a new paper out since Volume 7), providing clues to quests/changes to areas in the game. It may take some work, but the best way to keep the game fresh is to keep the zones fresh, and people coming back to them, wondering what is going to happen next, rather than isolating them more and more from each other...<br>
<br>
Finally, I never understood why Verant has had such a problem trying to control the issue of 'loot inflation' in the game.  The trivial loot code was an attempt to approach the issue ass-backwards, and after the horse had left the barn, as it were.<br>
<br>
Instead of trying to implement a trivial loot code, or making everything nodrop (although I like the fact that the best items are nodrop), the best way to eliminate runaway twinking is simply to require a character to be of an appropriate level to *equip* an item.  It's routinely done with text MUDs.  If the level of the character is far too low for that character to have contributed to the killing of the mob who drops/quests it, the item shouldn't 'proc':  'You do not possess the force of will to equip this item'.  Set the limit at 7 levels below the level of the mob in question (the point at which you cannot hit a mob with spells and are barely scratching it with weapons).  Voila! You have just put a huge dent in farming for twinks/cash, and low and mid level players will have something to look forward to again, as well as something of value to trade/sell down when they no longer need it.<br>
<br>
Of course, Halo, you are preaching to the choir here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  I do wish there was a way to bring people together in the game in a meaningful way these days other than zerg scale raids.  I really enjoy taking a group of 6-10 people down into a hole in the ground for a night of spelunking, with the hope of having some surprizes along the way.  One of the few things that Verant appears to have done 'right' with this expansion is to create some high level zones that will allow for experienced players to continue the smaller scale game.  I just wish they would do something for the 'old world', and the newer players in it, to stimulate interest in the first 45-50 levels, else Verant is going to wake up one day and find that their wellspring of new players has dried up completely...<br>

I disagree, but then again, I love a crawl. Part of the problem with the outdoor zones is ability to sow, rareity of adds, and the safety of the /shout train to zone prevent some players from learning the abilities/limits of their classes.<br>

I think this issue is not a one track problem. It also ties in to the affair of twinking, as Nydia said. Because frankly, after exping from 1 - 60 the hard - well I wouldn't say hard. I'd say proper - way, people want to find a fast route to 60 with their spanking new twink.<br>
Well for me, this isn't the case. As I said when I started this thread, I was extremely excited to hit all the old zones I encounted while levelling up myself. But alas, completely empty. I was literally FORCED to go to a crowded open zone, having no friend of equivelent level to group with or the ability to solo well, if at all.<br>
I completely disagree Sphirek, I don't believe EverQuest would have died long ago without expansions. Sure, without AN expansion, but expansion's - I don't think so.<br>
Infact, I believe that this eagerness Verant possess to expand Norrath in every direction possible, making the high end game's content ever increasing, will be its demise.<br>
Why? Simple, perhaps. It will implode. Add more height to the mountain, more and more ToV's, more and more ST's, soon everyone will be at that level, full quest armour, dragon haste, dragon ratio weapons. Even the newbies will be given high level dungeon hand me downs. They won't KNOW what a Dagger* is, or a Sr Apprentice Robe.<br>
It will be ALL about the high end game. But then they'll look, and see that you cannot have a game with one end. Because the oh so many continents they've put in are useless. That the lower end content and the middle end content are worthless. Perhaps extremely mild stepping stones.<br>
Are we all doomed to be in full velious quest armour, weilding our epics, with 100k in the bank? Sheesh, I hope not.<br>

<br>
That may be the best way to eliminate twinking (if you think twinking is a bad thing) but it absolutely ruins any hope of establishing an economy.  I've played on many MUDs that require a level for equipping and all it does is prevent people from trading items.  High end items become essentially &quot;sacrifices&quot; without any use whatsoever.  Degrading items is another option some MUDs choose, but that simply leads to player hassle and workarounds.  I'm not sure how bustling the trade economy on DAOC is which has both degradation and a pseudo level limit.  My hunch is there isn't a whole lot of trading relating to looted items.<br>
<br>
The biggest problem Verant has with a &quot;spreading&quot; out player base is the lack of effective cross-zone communication tools for those seeking groups/adventure/whatnot.  LFG was an attempt but because of lack of player use etc. it has not been the savior it might have been.  To improve the ease of grouping Verant needs to establish:<br>
<br>
(1) an effective cross zone communication tool specifically for those looking for groups.  This can be done by having a serverwide LFG chat channel.  Even better though, Verant could have something a player could access making themselves available for a group that shows class and level as well as showing group leaders and what classes they need.  That way, you could check the page and immediately see &quot;Group needs warrior in sebilis&quot; or &quot;Group needs rogue/wiz/mage in Velks&quot; etc.  People tend to congregate where they know it will be easy to get a group.  Outdoor zones are typically easier to put together a patchwork group and fight so people tend to stick to those areas.<br>
<br>
(2) an easier way to get to groups looking for people.  Let's face it, on regular nights most people are looking to begin playing as quickly as possible.  They don't want to spend 1 hour trekking all over Norrath before they actually start playing.  Perhaps give mages the ability to COH people (at great component and mana cost) across zone lines and non grouped folks (with consent of course).  Or give wizards the ability to reverse translocate someone to the group.  Yea this second point would trivialize travelling in the game and would have been overbalancing 2 years ago but now it would simply be a convenience factor. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=nydia>Nydia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/18/02 1:58:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=824.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Expansions - Exmanshons!</span><hr size=1> I would *love* to see a serverwide LFG function implemented in the game.

<br>
I disagree with you though that requiring characters to be of a certain level would 'kill' the economy, however.  In a world the size of Norrath (and now Luclin), it should *enhance* the economy, in that there will always be people who like to level quicker rather than more slowly, and do not want to spend the days to weeks it takes to camp, say the Paw of Opolla or Incandescent Mask quest items, or who are spending those levels in another part of the world.  They will still be able to buy these items in their low 20s (teens if you institute the 7 level limit), and the items will retain their value longer (good for the mid 40s player who may be trading up at that time) if the number of people farming them for their twinks is reduced.  It won't, of course, eliminate farming; but it would greatly slow down the practice and normalize the economy for low-mid level characters.<br>
I would be happy with more items in the game being NODROP; but fear, especially at the lower levels, that this would cause serious bottlenecks/traffic jams in certain areas, as it already has in the past at many camps for nodrop quest components (such as the fungus mutant in the above-named Paw quest, etc). <br>
<br>
Just my 2 cents; I've played text muds for almost 10 years and seen the level limiting practice both enhance and stifle game economies, depending on the time committment involved in playing said game...<br>

<br>
This leaves the &quot;old&quot; world unwanted, un&quot;productive&quot; equipement wise, and looked down on.<br>
<br>
Verant would be smart if they made a &quot;free expansion&quot; wherein they changed Guk Upper, Guk Lower, Sol A, Sol B, ... perhaps some out door areas. Removed all the &quot;old drops&quot; and tuned all the original zones with &quot;expansion&quot; drops. This would go a huge way in providing diversity in choices of where to go.<br>
<br>
Not all items have to be different either. One could take a Velkator dropped item, rename it, retexture it, and pop it into Guk Lower or Sol B on a &quot;Boss type&quot; encounter per that level and that dungeon.<br>
<br>
Basically what is being scene is that the &quot;old&quot; needs to be refreshed to what has been made todays baseline after all these expansions on what ones return is for time invested.<br>
<br>
Equipement drives the masses, like it or not, and old world equipement does not call the attention to it it once did of any of the masses.<br>
<br>
Re-introduce some items that have come and gone perhaps too into the old world (Rubicite dropping in Sol B?, or Lusterous Russett dropping in PoH / PoF off of rare spawn mobs introducing 2 pieces per server reset?). Lil variety goes a long ways and the old world doesn't have the standard that new expansion zones have. <p><HR>

- Completely agree. And I promote your idea of how simple it would be to slap a different name and look on a new zone item, and drop it in the old world. Spice it up, buff stuff. How HARD can it be? Sure they can introduce new classes and races, uber zones and high end content encounters, thousands of new items and quests, but they can't beef up old zones?<br>
I find it funny that Verant don't notice how much of the content they've created, is rotting away, because they're creating more. <p>Halo 57th Beguiler<br>

<br>
It could also be that there is alot of lvl 50+ people that play and those zones you speak of just dont hold exp for them..that is why they are empty. Sebilis and Velks and to an extent Chardok are all very busy Dungeons yet. I most recently got my wife into playing so I plan on draging her to all the lvl 30-40 dungeons so she gets the feel for the game better than hours of exp grinding in open zones.<br>
