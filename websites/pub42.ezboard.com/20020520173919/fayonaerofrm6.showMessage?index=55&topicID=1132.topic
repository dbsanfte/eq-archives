<br>
Well guys...<br>
<br>
First Gratz to XA (My Family) on our vindi kill a couple nights ago that was a great kill and step for us<br>
<br>
Second FD i applaud your intent on help out ordre de corseries (Sp? sorry) In this highly competitive game you guys took your time to help and that is a very honorable thing<br>
<br>
3rd XA Read above same thing<br>
<br>
Guys we all know words hurt and being disrespecting or infringed upon is a painful thing...FD i understand your concerns about people entering an unstable zone but also give some people credit in that they may know what they are doing...atleast i know kala is a very organized and wise leader <br>
<br>
I was not there in UP when the shit hit the fan i guess you could say but either way it seems to just have been slung words in the heat of the moment but time has passed and above all this is a game (This goes for XA and FD and even that LS guy =) sam knows ya so i love ya too )<br>
<br>
Agreeably this CR was not handled in either guilds ideal fashion but what was to be accomplished? A CR for a guild that was in trouble   What was the result? A sucessful CR for all the fallen troops...Conclusion good show FD good show XA you helped out those in need at the sacrifice of your own time   Just because of a couple misunderstandings dont overlook the great deed that has been done by BOTH FD and XA and let us all  sit and pat our selves on the back for looking out for those in need of help and remember that the small things are just that...small and not needed to fret over<br>
<br>
I have grouped/played with a decent amount of FD people and they all seem very decent even you Shorty  i even think youve clicked me a couple times (Thanks again =) ) and XA is a group of wonderful people too    we all enjoy the game thats why we keep playing so lets keep the atmosphere enjoyable to all<br>

Ack, what does that mean!<br>
<br>
Anyways, I just got online and re-read my posts and everyone else's post, and I realized I'm a complete asshole when I'm stoned!! LOL.<br>
<br>
@(most of) Final Destiny: I'm sorry for insulting your guild.. I re-read my posts and saw some of the comments I made. I truly apologize. FD has a lot of nice people (I'm not a nice person, sorry!) and are also climbing their way up the ladder to be one of the top guilds.<br>
<br>
@Kelraz: Thanks man, ya kept yer cool even under my assholeness (is that a word?). Blee. Btw, I am level 60, so I guess I'm a dork too. :-D<br>
<br>
@Axlelan: Go kill Vulak or somethin', just don't get involved with something that doesn't involve you... and if I read the whole thread correctly I don't see anywhere that says: &quot;Uber bishes come knock on a lesser guild's acheivements!&quot;. Damn troll rogues.<br>
<br>
@anyone else I offended: Sorry, now GFY thx.<br>

Can't Log into the game or I probably would let the thread just fade away. So a Few Final comments.<br>
<br>
Paragraphs are good Mmkay. For those never ending blocks of text, on a Monitor can be tough to follow.<br>
<br>
Some things that still catch my attention:<br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 &quot;Additionally I know Shortyrez and while he may be out of line at times, as a guild we love him for it because it helps keep the rest of us in line headed towards the goal.&quot;<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
hrmm and this one...<br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 &quot;Granted, Kalatarain, our guildleader, IS an asshole, and has no tact, so we usually try to avoid having him play PR with other guilds....but hey we love the fuggin guy and hes a good leader if yer on our side /shrug.&quot;<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Maybe shoulda made this post &quot;When two assholes pass in the night&quot;<br>
<br>
Maybe what makes them both good leaders to their respective guilds, is the fact they dont give a rats ass about anyone else except their own, and whatever mission they may be on.<br>
<br>
We know Kala is an asshole. He is an asshole bc if you ask him to do anything outside of our game plan you will get the infamous Kalatarain tells you,'GFY!'.<br>
<br>
We hide his silly ass behind everyone else bc of this. Well atleast for the most part. He knows it, he probably doesnt care much either. You wont see him flaming anyone on any boards. It is a rare occasion he will stop for anything, anyone for any reason. He is Focused as hell and that is good for us, bad for anyone else bc he doesnt have time for yas. Which means he also doesnt instigate it..he will fight back though.<br>
<br>
<br>
I am not gonna expand this post even more with quoting all of the good things I have read. But FINALLY some intelligence. None from Shortyrez but that is fine. For those taht took time to read this thread and actually post something that makes sense and is obviously well thought out, I appreciate your comments and the fact that you seem to &quot;get what I am saying&quot; for the most part atleast.<br>
<br>
I know Kala is an asshole, I didnt know Shortyrez was such an asshole. Why I came here to try and clear things up.<br>
<br>
Will I let this all drop? Yah with FD as a Guild I think I will. With Shortyrez? Sure I could be the &quot;bigger person&quot; But what fun is that? This isnt RL after all  <br>
<br>
Shortyrez, GFY YSP, I wouldnt let you near my llama no matter how much plat you have. Your lack of self control and intelligence is more than appearant than ever. In one thread you speak of apologies and being sorry for outlashing at folks, yet you still do it. You have serious issues:<br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 &quot;To anyone else I've ever offended, well sorry it happens. Those of me who know me best, tell me that I'm a good guy inside and I hope they are right. I'm not making this post to garner attention or whatever, I just want to express that I am sorry for what I have said/done in the past. I feel it will be more appreciated by these people mentioned by saying it now than when I retired from the game (like that'll ever happen). So take this post for whatever it's worth =P<br>
<br>
Now let's play the game and stop bishing at each other, hmm? =D&quot;<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You take your meaning of selfworth from a bunch of other people Sad so very sad. The amount of hypocracy in this one part of your post is more than I could ever fully bring to words.<br>
<br>
Let me introduce you to one word that might help you understand where I am coming from.<br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 &quot;sin·cere Pronunciation Key (sn-sîr)<br>
adj. sin·cer·er, sin·cer·est <br>
1) Not feigned or affected; genuine: sincere indignation. <br>
2) Being without hypocrisy or pretense; true: a sincere friend. <br>
3) Archaic. Pure; unadulterated.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
If you ever expect anyone to listen to a single thing you say I suggest you be more sincere. Maybe you dont care? Then stop going out of your way to make posts saying that you dont mean to offend anyone.<br>
<br>
You do mean to offend people, you are an asshole.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;ass·hole   Pronunciation Key  (shl)<br>

<br>
But let me digress some more so I am sure to speak on your level.<br>
<br>
You are a worthless monkey fucking loser. I pray to god that you never choose to reproduce. The only reason you continue to live is because you are too stupid to be food. You attempt to prey on the good intentions of others with lies and deceit. This &quot;Im Sorry, but let me do it again and again&quot; ploy, isnt fooling anyone. Stop living the lie, admit your true worthless self. No one pays much attention to you unless you are bitching anyhow. This is just further proof of how worthless you really are.<br>
<br>
You are beyond arogance. Can you not be wrong too? I fully admitted that it was possible for me to be wrong. I asked for some clarifacation. You instead think you can do no wrong. WHO THE FUCK DIED AND MADE YOU GOD? Nobody did cause I'm still here.  What do you do when not playing EQ? Stand infront of a mirror and flexing and talking to yourself? Fucking loser, if you only realised just how immature it is to sit there and sling insults at someone trying to have a decent conversation.<br>
<br>
So now go rub one out and say hi to Rosie. Better that you splooge your genetics into some sock than chance you breeding. I am done wasting my time with this post and you.<br>
