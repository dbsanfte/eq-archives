<br>
<br>
TOPIC - USELESS POLLS<br>
http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessage?topicID=193.topic<br>
This is the most useless piece of garbage poll here. It doesn't even have a topic to vote on. If you're going to make a poll, at least give people something to vote on.<br>
<br>
<br>
TOPIC - CAREBEARS<br>
http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessage?topicID=176.topic<br>
There is a lot of potential here with this one, but do people rant, argue or debate about the hypocracy that is Verant's naming policy? Nope, instead everyone just holds hands and gets all carebears with each other. I'm discusted with the lack of flaming going on here.<br>
<br>
<br>
TOPIC - GUILDS THAT SUCK<br>
When people to flame around here, it is always of the nature of "What guild sucks the most" or "Guild gone bad" or "That guild is EVIL!* I'm sure there are other things to flame about. Guess what guys? I'm sure we could find something wrong with every guild on this server if we really wanted to. I doubt that any guild is 100% perfect in every manner. I'm sure it would be more interesting to read if people would flame about other stuff or find new ways to flame about guilds. Or how about we find new things to flame about.<br>
<br>
<br>
TOPIC - POST HIJACKERS<br>
I think that part of the biggest problem here is Post Hijacking Gang posting off topic in almost every topic that comes up. One or two off topic postings is ok, but not when the off topic postings take over. This has got to stop. We can't have any serious flames going on here if at some point it will degrade to mindless drivel.<br>
<br>
<br>
TOPIC - HAPPY HAPPY JOY JOY POSTINGS<br>
This is in regards to those Boy Bands and Beauty Pagent postings. Nothing wrong with them on their own. The problem is that they out number the flames that they sometimes spill over into other topics where people don't want to hold hands and be friendly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Fee free to complain and NAG about anything above. After all, that's what this posting is about. No carebears please!<br>

If you're going to flame, don't appologies afterwards. It's just saying please ignore all the nasty things I said cause I don't really mean it. What's the point of even flaming in the first place.<br>
<br>
<br>

I wasn't really whining, but perhaps I was just too polite. I will try to be more of an asshole next time.<br>

<br>
Roso, since you made the mistake of sticking your head into yet another topic, and one that involves flaming, I feel the overwhelming need to release some steam.  I don't know if you were just asking Crydee or people in general.  Your very name pisses me off.  I don't even want to imagine what kind of a sicko brags about what he does with his hands.  Even if (which I hope) it is only a joke, it is disgusting and offensive as hell.  If there was an /ignore feature on this board, yours would be the first name on it.  Not only the disgusting pictures of warped gnomes, but the fact that you post constantly just to see the little words under your name change.  Fine, if you have something interesting to add, add it.  But most of your posts are inane drivel that I'm sure few, if any, people actually enjoy reading.  I know that I can just choose not to read threads with your name in them, but since you respond to just about everything posted on this board, it's extremely difficult to avoid them.  Your huge pictures take up too much bandwidth and make pages load slow for no good reason.  It was probably wrong for me to even dignify your existence on this board by acknowledging that you annoy the crap out of some of us.  But dammit, this is the NAG board, and if you're going to post as much as you do you have to expect some of us not to like it.<br>
<br>
I'm tired of the lovey-dovey nice crap on this board.  Unfortunately there are no alternatives that I know of yet.  So I hope I can help shape this board into something better by being a total jerk from now on.  Maybe if enough of us do this we can shift the balance and make it even out.<br>
<br>
Btw, I totally agree with Livtinth about that &quot;Cheekas&quot; site and the attitude of a lot of us rl females that play EQ.  The flirty &quot;blows you a kiss&quot; crap is just annoying, and I assure you I won't make the mistake of going to that page again.<br>
<br>
No, not all females that play EQ are nice.  In fact, I'm a complete bitch.  And it's time I start acting like it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uliandriana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Liandriana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(4/19/01 1:14:03 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fine.</span><hr size=1> /em stands in awe of Lierre's words.

<br>
LOL!!!<br>
<br>
You guys are so funny. I make the stupiest silliest poll ever just to piss you off and instead of either ignoring me or laughing about it, you rant about it as if I wanted t make something senseful.<br>
In the very same way you rant about Roso as if he would mean anything he says in any serious way.<br>
<br>
People. Just a hint. CALM DOWN!!!!!!!<br>
I can and I do post many serious post. I can think and I do however think hard and serious about serious problems. <br>
If something serious is up I am the first to post a serious background, to start a serious discussion. <br>
I am a very serious person, sometimes.<br>
<br>
But this is a N.A.G. Board, this is a Game and this is my spare time. And I like to have fun.<br>
So all you people that think that we must either post our serious thoughts about verants balance issues or then talk about the new expansion and JUST talk about this. SCREW YOU!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
I am allowed and I am willing to have fun on this board as much as I am allowed and willing to have fun everywhere else (just not in my office during I talk to my boss).<br>
I don't insult anyone, I don't harass anyone, I don't piss anyone off (at least its not my intention) and I do really really like to post serious thoughts and serious issues on this board. <br>
But do not come here and tell me to piss off or how stupid and how &quot;low&quot; or how unworthy I am or that I should be ignored just because I have fun here on this Board. <br>
<br>
I cause no harm to anyone. I express my feeling and I speak my mind since it is my right to do so (again, I don't do insult or personally attack people). And if I feel like post a stupid post or make a joke, or if I feel like making a stupid poll since people bitch about stupid posts, then I will do it and I don't give a rats ass whether you appreciate it or not. I just think it is sad that YOU do care!<br>
<br>
I really like this community here. I think people are really nice and I can have fun as much  as discuss serious matters. I think thats a great combination. <br>
So do not come here and tell me to only post serious posts about whatever issue just EQ-Related so that we can have really meaningful discussions. <br>
<br>
I have honor, I have pride and I am nice to almost every person in RL and in Norrath. It means much to me to be nice and to have friends and to help people and to discuss matters.<br>
Still I also like to have Fun and make silly jokes ok?<br>

<br>
Before we are going to say stuff like "SCREW YOU" at people, perhaps we should read the entire thread.<br>
<br>
Had you actually read the entire thread you would seen a reply which stated:<br>
"Actually, I was just giving an example of a flamming post."<br>
<br>
<br>
So there was no reason to get all defensive because at no point did I tell you or anyone else to "piss off." As for as to why I picked that one as an example. It was on page one for one thing, and I didn't feel like digging up old stuff when there was one right there. It is also the most blantant example of a poll gone bad as it didn't even have a topic.<br>

<br>
I don't feel like retyping everything so  will leave it with a short note:<br>
- You wanted Flame, you got flame.<br>
<br>
I didn't mean to be as harsh as it may have sounded. Still I do feel the way I did post, just would I normally choose another style and another way to communicate. I just felt like giving you the flame you asked for.<br>
I see that "Screw you" hurt you, I am sorry. I feel much respect for you and I did not want to attack you, especially since I did not really mean YOU. <br>
You can see in the context that I talk about people that think that on a Board you should just discuss game related issues. <br>
And lets rephrase "Screw you" to, "I do not agree with you guys here".<br>
There you got the way I really meant it.<br>
<br>
But as I said, you wanted Flame, you got Flame. I also tried hard to keep up.<br>
<br>

Nope actually, you make yourself look like someone who can't come up with an even half-way decent comeback.<br>

My feelings were in no way hurt.<br>

<br>
Come on people..Crydee has the right idea..this isn't the Happy Land of Make Believe..I do believe you can NAG here..<br>

<br>

Nothing in it I take seriously.  Crydee, I couldn't or wouldn't give a flying fuck to what you think or what you say.  Same things go to you Yuegou.  If you Take offense to a gnome head on a Werewolf body, then HAHAHA, you have fucking problems.  If you can't handle the pictures, then get a faster computer with more ram and a larger Bandwidth.  Gnomes are annoying, get over it.<br>
<br>
Here will say it again for all you that have to refresh due to my HUGE Pictures.  I DON'T GIVE A FLYING FUCK ABOUT WHAT ANY OF YOU THINK!  If you think that a joke that was made one and a half years ago, and you are still insulted about.  You two have far weaker and sensitive minds than I first thought.  If you are insulted by such juvenile humor, why are you even playing Everquest? Why are you even on the internet? That stuff is every where.<br>
<br>
Yes, I like to ramble, if you don't like it, then take your pansy asses back to what ever country you came from and stick your head in the dirt, because where ever you go, there will be people like me there. *does an evil laugh*<br>
<br>
There are an estimated (not to much estimation is needed) of around 4-6 people on this board with a sense of humor. Casidy is one, Mainly because she knows where I am coming from and I have known her pretty much my entire EQ life.  Sir Taino, one.. No wait, THE Greatest Paladin Even to level in EQ.  Febreeza ,mainly because she is a gnome:-)  The rest of you fucks who think that my rambling on, my thoughts, my action are repulsive, then I suggest you pull your head out of your asses and figure out that life is not a thing that will just present everything to you on a silver platter.<br>
<br>
Man, you all disgust me (save for those mentioned and the moderators of this board, mainly because you are all cool)  Why do I even bother with you people.<br>
<br>
