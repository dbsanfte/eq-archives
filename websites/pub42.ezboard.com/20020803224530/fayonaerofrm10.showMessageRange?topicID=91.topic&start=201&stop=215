<br>
<br>
In the wee hours of the morning I returned to Neriak from a successful hunt in Karnors Castle, intent on selling my wares and having a few pints at the Maidens Fancy. As I approached the main gate, I observered a high priest of Innoruuk by the name of Dorvias N`Keth speaking to a small group of adventurers. Intrigued by this gathering, I moved foward to listen.<br>
<br>
Dorvias N`Keth begain to tell the group that a few nights ago he had sacrificed Lanys T`Vyl to the Prince of Hate because of her treachery against Innoruuk and his followers. After learning of her death, Lanys T`Vyl's followers had stolen her body from Neriak and brought it to their hiding place in Befallen. Dorvias N`Keth then informed us of what our tasks was to be: To go to Befallen and recover a ring from the body of Lanys, which was imbued with the power of summoning an individual, so Dorvias could summon the body back to Neriak.<br>
<br>
Our hearty band of adventurers made our way to Befallen and encountered Baron Telyx, who was the keeper of the body. Posing as mourners to the fallen Lanys T`Vyl, we begged Baron Telyx to give us the ring from the body so we could &quot;gather forces against Neriak&quot;. We were successful in our lie and I was given possession of the ring, so we headed back to Neriak to give it to Dorvias.<br>
<br>
Once I handed the ring to him, Dorvias made his way deeper into Neriak to a place of power and summoned the corpse of Lanys. Once Dorvias completed his incantations, Innoruuk himself made an appearance and informed us that he was pleased by our efforts!<br>
<br>
---------------------------<br>
<br>
Also, from another server:<br>
<br>
<br>
It was an average day like most, I Endaro a 35 magician was heading to WC to collect some spider silks. On the way I heard rumor of a gm event in oasis with nearly 50 spectres on spectre isle. When I got there everyone said it was over, but there would be another event soon.<br>
<br>
A Dark Elf Necromancer by the name of Reepir, had stumbled upon a dying dark elf npc. The dying dark elf told him to give a brief message to Dorvieas N'Keth in neriak. I had heard this and followed Reepir to neriak. Only s few others followed, everyone thought the event was just a bunch of spectres. We found Dorvias and gave him the brief message. Something about the asumption was correct but the location was wrong. He then explained to us what had happend. Lanys T'Vyl had been killed.<br>
<br>
If you remember her she is the daughter of the prince of hate, and has been trying to put together melevolence, a weapon Dorvias said was powerful enough to kill the dark father himself. She was killed in the frontier mountains with the help of mistmoore, whom Dorvias said he was glad he was no longer an ally to.Melevolence was completed and Dorvias now held it. They had ceromonial buried Lanys, but her corpse was recently stolen by her followers in befallen. Kaiten,Taeluen,and Zimlar were sent to go to beffalen and retrieve the ceromonial ring used to bury her from Baron Telyx, who was guarding her corpse in beffalen, while protecting reepir who was only lv 9.<br>
<br>
Scout Ziana escorted us to beffalen and after some searching the four dark elves and everyone following them found the Baron. He was a VERY stubborn npc. We finnaly convinced him to give us the worthless ring so we could &quot;destroy&quot; it for him. We quickly rushed back to neriak (with the help of Oglana's free sows). We gave the ring back to Dorvias and were told to follow him to where we were going to burry her. Upon reaching the cleric guild we were told to remain silent as Dorvias performed the ritual. After some chanting and sounds of echos filling the room, Lanys T'Vyl's corpse re apeared in front of us. Dorvias performed the buriel and we were then told to go to the arrival point,master beckoned. We followed Dorvias to the floating eye symbol in the waterfall. There we were told to pray, and after much praying, the Prince of Hate himself appeared before us.<br>
<br>
The Prince of Hate congratulated all for helping with the quest. He then asked if Dorvias had picked whom was to represent the prince of hate, Kaiten was chosen and told to step forward. By the dark father himself Kaiten was awarded the name &quot;Kaiten the Melevolent&quot;. He was also told to follow Dorvias to the dark elf who talks of the realm of heroes, Vorshar the despised, to recieve a second gift. At this point Zimlar asked if he could go, and was given a coin by dorvias to give to Vorshar for a reward also for his work ( we later found Zimlar to be a high elf in disguise but he died a bloody death when his illusion ran out) When we arrived at Vorshar, Dorvias gave kaiten a coin to give to him, Kaiten did, and he recieved MELEVOLENCE. THE MELEVOLENCE. Its stats were VERY good and he is very lucky hehe. Reepir was then called forward and got his Prize. So did Taeluen. And lastly, I was called forward. And although i wasn't of dark elf blood Dorvias said I was to be awarded also for the help in the retrieval of the ring.<br>
<br>
/ooc it was a great event and it wasnt one where 10 lv 60's massacre a mob for loot, luckily.<br>
<br>
Kaiten the melevolent got Melevolence, which is 19/29 effect melevolent grasp 10str 10 dex 10sv all 20int 20wis. Taeluen got a 5ac 4wis 4dex 4int necklace and a 20svall 2ac see invis ring. Reepir got a 10 ac 3str 5int necklace, and I got a 10int 20mana earring.<br>
<br>
we dont know about zimlar, since he hasnt turned his coin in yet. look for more events in the future for a lot is happening lately.<br>

<br>
<br>
&quot;I am a level 19 druid. I had just heard a shout from the town crier telling one and all to come to the Millers humble farm in order to cleanse the plains(in WK). <br>
When I arrived to the scene there was an NPC (or rather GM) named Velarte Selire. In different land marks (as i passed by them) there were Braziers of Rodcet Nife, they looked like shadowmen..but had the trademark &quot;enchanters begging cup&quot; in their hands (if they have any). <br>
<br>
Soon Velarte Selire began shout, calling people to the millers and to help him cleanse the plains just as the town crier had. when he finally cut the the chase he produced a magical item called a smudge stick. He went over to a Brazier and put it to the creature, it then became a &quot;filled brazier&quot;. <br>
<br>
He then proceeded to give people the smudge sticks, instructing them to do the same as he had done. I was lucky enough to get one and hurredly gave one to the nearest Brazier at a farmhouse near the water. I was given some exp (actually a lot of exp for a quest) and a &quot;blessed ring of rodcet nife&quot;.<br>
<br>
It had +2 wis, 1ac and 1 charge of greater healing. When all the hassle had been done with putting the Smudge sticks into the Braziers the land rumbled, i started to praise Karana, just as i should. Fireworks exploded everywhere and i kept getting the message &quot;the plain begins to cast a spell&quot;.. <br>
<br>
The priest ran off eventually, commended me for my shouting of praise of karana, saying &quot;Sphan, mayhap you could teach your friend there what it is to follow Karana... striking down the one that engineered the healing of the lands of one's god is hardly commendable&quot;. Soon after he scolded the offending druid, ran off and started shouting about giving the news to the priests of Qeynos.Soon after the message came up saying :The air seems to pulsate as healing magical energy floods across the plains.&quot;<br>

a town scryer shouted that it was time to cleanse karana from the evil plague.. so i decided to move there,When i zoned to karana i saw Braziers of Rodcet Nife's near búildings when i was heading towards the millers. When i came to the miller house Velarte Selire was there asking me if i have come to help against the plague, i then told him i was...after a few ppl were gatherd he explain what we had to do..he then handed out smudge stick's that we were gonna give to the Braziers of Rodcet nife and after you handed em they became a Filled Brazier like Halo posted...and after we filled all Braziers up he told us to gather and he Picked 4 of the 20 that was there, Me,Benpus,Brunix and one other sorry for forgeting your name... after that he told Benpus Brunix and the third person to hold hands while i was gonna stand behind him,after they had gatherd their hands he explained to me that i was the one that had been choosen to Light up the braziers in Rodcent nife's name and he gave me the Charcold of Rodcent nife, after i turned in the charcold to the Filled Brazier a Voice began to speak (will try to get Screenshots of this forgot to take some) and then the land began to heal itself and Velarte Selerin said that the plague was gone and no evil was left....<br>
