We also have to be very specific bout what is a &quot;raid&quot; and or alliance event also. We do alot of things together, which could be considered either way, buncha peeps slaying or &quot;raid&quot; hehe as long as we very detailed into what constitutes points and such.  I like the idea of getting points for attending epic mob hunts, would also encourage people to aid in all the epic kills they could <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Normally when I do log on during the weeknights it's for an hour to three at the maximum.  This puts me out of the weekly raids and for this I feel bad.  Not because I'm missing the chance on loot but because I'm not contributing much to my guild/alliance.<br>
Attending raids is not about getting loot, it's about the guild(s) coming together to assist each other in improving the guild(s).  Yes, when you are fortunate enough to be awarded or win a roll on a nice piece of gear it's a joyous thing, but should be an added bonus, not the highlight of the raid for you.<br>
I'm not pointing fingers here and saying that person x is greedy or loot hungry.  I have not met anyone in DS or OOtBS that I feel is way.  I do realise how easy it is to be caught up in looking things up on the web and imagining how nice that item would be for your character.  I'm a 49 monk and still wearing a serpentine bracer on one wrist...there are many wrist items I've drooled over on the web.<br>
I don't have better for many reasons, I haven't gotten in groups at places these drop, I haven't farmed PP to buy a better one and to be honest, I have a hard time sticking to one of my characters for an extended period of time.  That's a fault I have and therefore I miss out on gear, but I don't miss out on why I play...For the fun.<br>
Well, this has been long winded enough I think.  Let's all try to make what raids we can, reguardless of whether or not we're going to get loot.  If more people pitch in to the alliance raids, the smoother the raids will go, the more drops we'll get and the more raids we'll hold, all increasing the nice drops for everyone.<br>
May Quellious bring peace and tranquility into your lives.<br>

<br>
Aye, this is my feeling exactly as to the way to approach raids. I always tell anyone that will listen to never expect loot or exp (and expect to lose exp for that matter) on raids. You will never be disapointed that way. Heck, I went to fear a couple of weeks ago with NTB for the hell of it, knowing I would likely get no loot or exp and probably lose exp. I lost a half a blue bub of exp, and never though anything of it. Had a blast and made some new friends.<br>
<br>
As to looting rules, I have no real problem with most of the ideas that are possible, however, I do think the 55+ BP issue should be amended to 50+ and full guild members (no probationaries), with Kael BPs going to 55+ that *do not* have planar. Having a planar BP go to someone on a plane raid, and then a week later having them get a Kael BP is simply a waste and hurts us as a whole. So basically, if you don't have kunark class armor, planar, (of course kael/ss quests armor) then you don't get Kael BP unless everyone 50+ has a BP of that caliber.<br>
<br>
I would also like to suggest that some of these loot rules be amended so that for the *few* people that only show up on Fear or Hate (depending on where their armor drops) and skips the other cannot loot armor till everyone else gets something and they don't get first dibs on legs/bp. There are a few people like that (I won't name names, we probably all know most of the individuals), and they shouldn't be awarded.<br>
<br>
One other thing, I think either the points that items cost should be raised, or the points we receive for attending should be lowered from the proposal, as many of us will end up with a ton of unused points creating a lot of arguments when everyone wants to &quot;buy&quot; the same thing. Hell, maybe the original loot list format can be used, where priority to buy is given to the person highest on the lists. Just some thoughts.<br>

I've been one of the lucky ones &amp; won or tied on a couple of items, but I can definitely understand the disappointment of people who put everything they have into a raid only to come up empty handed over and over.<br>
<br>
It's pretty clear that randoming loot just doesn't keep people happy.  Points may not make everyone happy either, but at least points will be based on participation rather than dumb luck.  Those who give the most, get the most!<br>
<br>
Points don't have to be complicated . . . we could say if you're at a raid for a minimum of 2 hours, you get 1 point.  If you're there for three hours or longer, you get a bonus point.  Maybe individuals who can use an item bid points on it or a specific point value is assigned to each type of item and those interested roll on the item and then the winner has those points deducted from their total.  These are rough ideas, but I think we really need to get a point system hammered out and get rid of the random loot rolls we have now, 'cause it's already causing tension and it's just going to build if we don't get it worked out. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uskier8734.showPublicProfile?language=EN>skier8734</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#0000FF>(2/7/02 3:05:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fallianceraidforumfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Loot rules discussion</span><hr size=1> let me say that i really like abazagaroth's idea for both the bp's and the fear/hate raids.  this makes a whole ton of sense to me.<br>

I do understand the issue, and there are people out there that intentionally skip the Hate raids if their armor doesn't drop there; same with Fear.  I am a druid and ironically I am on the other end of the spectrum, I have attended a lot more Hate raids than Fear; simply because of scheduling though not by choice.  Now had I been a cleric then this could be misinterpreted by some that I don't attend Fear raids as often because my armor doesn't drop there.  Basically, who makes the decision that the lack of attendance at a raid was because &quot;...their armor doesn't drop there...&quot;<br>
<br>
Also, level based looting, i.e. 55+ for BP's, is too discriminating.  If you are of a level sufficient to participate/contribute to the raid, then you deserve a chance at the loot, whether it be point based or /random based.  With the point based system the odds should automatically favor the higher level 55+ player if they have participated in more raids, and vice versa for the lower level 48 it they have participated in more.  I would hope that people will realize who needs a piece more and act accordingly, but that may not be the case.<br>
<br>
Final point to make is the contention that someone will loot a planar BP then a week later at a Kael raid loot the quest armor piece.  Frankly, I hope I never see that happen.  As Kenzo posted earlier,  “Attending raids is not about getting loot, it's about the guild(s) coming together to assist each other in improving the guild(s).”<br>

I have attended about 95percent of raids.  i dont know what ya mean about people not attending raids because their armor doesnt drop there.  If people are only gonna do raids for loot only, maybe we dont want these types...Remember the game is supposed to be FUN, ok youve been on 6 raids still havent gotten anything, WELCOME TO THE CLUB! Paith and dinekus have done kael many many many many times, cyphonic too, and i think they barely have 3 thurg quest armor pieces between the 3 of em, if that many.<br>
<br>
I be fine either way because i attend the raids frequently, and i got 55, and i can roll like a demon, so either way good for me, but i am not REALLY that concerned about loot. HAVE FUN, thats the whole point of game. the 3 raid laws...<br>
<br>
1) dont expect loot<br>
2) dont expect XP<br>
3) expect to die alot<br>

then if ya get loot, or xp, or live, its a bonus<br>

Most people say Oh just get buffs and you will have over 1k and be fine pulling, Ok go try pulling a mob then getting dispelled on the way back.  But thats the risk I take because I enjoy pulling so much, as for exp, all those people that are worried about EXP on a raid, I would not rather have you there becuase if you nuke to early you are goign to die and be less effective to the raid and cause more downtime,  Exp for me on raids is a very good bonus because, well Who dies Me or the enchanter who Tashes/debuffs and incidently probably in my group so we have to get some exp to make up for lost exp.

<br>
My best experience was with the Loot comittee<br>
<br>
the Loot committee was made up of 7 officers one <br>
from every Class (main classes) <br>
<br>
It was also a hand-me down system that you only got loot it you <br>
passed on your loot to the next man in line <br>
<br>
So if I had a Donal BP and I won a ToV one <br>
I would give my donals to Damaniel and he would <br>
give his Seb to Gathanile  (hypathical)<br>
<br>
having a person form every Main classes in commitee helps split<br>
responsiblity( the cleric new the armor needed for every Cleric) <br>
Warrior for the war's <br>
<br>
they only gave loot away if a majority of officer were pressent (4)<br>
<br>
Food for thought but this better helps the whole Chain <br>
of a Class to upgrade at once. <br>
<br>
Plus it gave some disscreation to the Loot commitee if I person <br>
went out of there way to help in alot of raids or did some great <br>
service for the guild, etc the loot commitee would pass on the reward <br>
of service (give them the drop)<br>
<br>
Just an Idea to think about ) <br>

I think it's a great idea, and personally, I would love it if we could use a system like that, where things are based on merit and consideration of prior loot won and an individual's effectiveness, etc.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, though, my instincts tell me a system like that is ultimately doomed to fail and cause a lot of arguing and resentment.  I think human nature would lead people to start seeing favouritism (whether it exists or not).  I also think it could put a lot more pressure on guild officers; they're already getting a lot of flak about the unfairness of random rolling and I imagine it would only increase if the officers were personally responsible for who got what loot.<br>
<br>
I think, given the nature of humanity in general, our best bet is an impartial point system that is entirely based on actual numbers.  With points being awarded based only on participation, there is absolutely no question of who &quot;deserves&quot; to win loot because everyone can see for themselves that a particular individual has *earned* the points to win the loot.<br>

The 55+ doesnt mean you won't get any loot the &quot;one loot till everyone has something&quot; still aplys even if the 55+ get something. In other words the 55+ has to pass on everthing else to have a chance at BP or legs.. and if  he loots something else his chance at BP/legs has to be passed down.<br>
<br>
All the 55+ rule does is give someone of high lvl, that has gone to probably 3 times as many planes raids as some one under 55, better odds to get what they still need to upgrade on.<br>

<br>
Cause i understand all angles on this one, have many real good friends who make every raid, and many real good friends that can sparsely attend, but both are in my opinion equally valuable to the guilds.<br>
<br>
most people would love to attend more, and do more raids/epic hunts but its &quot;impossible&quot; because or certain obligations.   <br>
<br>
and grats tabalar on GLADIATOR ARMS!   <br>
<br>
Tabalar is one who i think of, he isnt able to attend many of our raids,(because of time zone/family obligations) <br>
....but the guy goes out of his way to do anything for ya that you need, hes a great person, and to see him get super PHAT kael loot made me happy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Maybe...<br>
<br>
 Planear drop armor (up for grabs)<br>
<br>
Kael drop quest armor (given out by loot coordinators based on guild needs, player merit, points, etc etc....)<br>
<br>
but not quite as simplied...just an example<br>

<br>
The 55+ rule is probably a good idea.  I guess what makes me most in favor of it is that if you are 55+ and don't already have at least your planar bp you are really in need.  By the same token I can completely understand the cry of the less than 55 people that having better equipment will allow you to get to 55+ faster.  Azerik is a chronically underequipped warrior.  Slowly over the past few months I have gotten a couple of pieces that have improved him so as to at least get rid of the stuff he has been wearing since level 20 or so, but he still lacks in areas that would make him a better tank and thus benefit all.<br>
<br>
It would be great if I could get a thurg breastplate for him, but if Dinekus is still fighting at his level (58? 56?) and doesen't even have a planar bp then he needs it far more than I do.  I would say that we do need to keep that 55+ rule with some officer discretion in it though.  If we have ToonX that is semi-retired or the owner is playing alts all the time now and only brings ToonX out for occasional exercise but is over 55 it would pain me greatly to see that good bp or legs go to ToonX when someone else could get far more use out of it even if they are under 55.<br>
<br>
The point system that has been proposed as I understand it would award points for showing up to the raid and if you spent part of them on a drop then the remainder would stay in your &quot;bank&quot; until you wanted to use them.  I think this is a good system, it encourages people to show up to raids and build up their point totals or to consider more carefully what bits of armor they want rather than just rolling on everything in order to get something.<br>
<br>
We will be figuring out what constitutes &quot;attendance&quot; at the raid however.  The very nature of this game has us scattered from the west coast of the USA all the way to the UK (don't think we have anyone further out in either direction anymore).  That makes it difficult to find a time when everyone can attend, but there are ways to work around that.  As of now we have people that will have to leave early and people that will come late.  We need to establish some guidelines that say about how long a raid should take (very flexible, but good for a yardstick) and a cutoff time that if you arrive after or leave before you won't be getting points.  It is harsh, but it needs to be that way to keep people from showing up for the first 5 minutes or the last 5 minutes and demanding points when there are people that have been there for 14 hours.<br>
<br>
I just put this up as a &quot;policy&quot; on our site, but will state it here because it applies.  If you want people to come to your events and help you achieve the goals you have then you need to sacrifice your time in &lt;insert favorite hunting ground here&gt; and get out to other peoples raids.  This means slower experience probably since you will be devoting time to helping someone else rather than your own advancement, but it will make it much more likely that the guy you helped with that quest the other day want to show up at your epic raid.<br>
<br>
Guilds in general and alliances in particular are about helping each other to accomplish things we can't do by ourselves.  It means that I need some people to help me kill those giants in WL for the last bit of the phenocryst focus quest so I call on my guildies.  They show up because they want to help, they fight hard, some of them die (hehe, rikko if I remember right), and they pull out the W and help me get my quest finished.  There is no way I could have done that as a necro (or any other class) and lived by myself no matter what level I was.  Now, did they *have* to? no.  But they did because they wanted to help.  I will remember that when one of them needs help finishing one of the ring quests or has a bad spot in a deep dungeon and needs a body or 6 summoned.<br>
<br>
Before I wander any further afield I just want to thank everyone for posting on this, we really need the input as officers to help to establish a policy that pisses the most people off at once..no wait, makes as many people happy as we can, yeah, that's it.  Knowing your feelings on the matter really does help.<br>
<br>
Just remember this is a G A M E, it is supposed to be F U N, if you have lost sight of either of those words I am sure you have a dictionary around somewhere in the house, you might want to refresh.  <br>
