<br>
Anyway, you can't exactly explain evolution to the barbarians and expect them to understand it.  It's much easier to just tell em &quot;I created you.&quot; It's simple, it's true, and it's a way they could understand.  I don't think God or an Angel was ready at the time to sit down for a couple months and explain how evolution works and all the sciences involved.  Or do you really think that there could be a being we call &quot;God&quot; who couldn't have possibly forseen a need for oil?  Einstein would have told you there is a God.  Hawking will tell you there is a God.  Both em them will tell you that because of the perfectly balanced forces they see within science that have no reason to be.  If all electrons had a slightly different charge than what they hold the universe wouldn't exist at all and matter couldn't coalesce (sp?)  Millions of things such as that in perfect balance with the rest speaks of the evidence of God to those men.  Or... you can take the approach that there's an infinite number of universes and all that perfect balance was bound to happen in one of them.  You're never going to find out for sure... get on with your life and live it how you think it's right.<br>
<br>
If there is a such a being as God  (I believe that there is) you can't even begin to second guess Him or begin to have a clue as to what His plan is and what He's taken into account for the progess of humanity.  Hell, we may not even be the end plan.  We might very well be another intermediary stage (like the dinosaurs) laying the groundwork for His real creation.  You can't and won't get an idea of the master plan until He comes and graces you with it.  Til then, live your life and be the person you want to be.  Stop relying on others or digging in holes asking who you should be and why you're here.  Make the most of it.<br>
<br>
Religion... of course there's a lot of jaded views out there.  Religion is/was all run by men on earth though some of you are really lacking in facts on historical evidence or are putting too much stock in it.  A lot of the things stated to have been found are really bullshit... even then a lot of those things that were found were found by men with their own interpretations.  Sorry, I don't accept any of em as fact knowing the unpredictable nature of the individual.  <br>
<br>
Unless there was an instruction book found along with a statue as to why it was made, how it got there, and what it was used for you can't even begin to say what it was for.  I could make a statue on a whim today that showed a man with three heads just for the hell of it and stick it under the floor of a church for the hell of it.  Some idiot a few thousand years down the road would find it and start spouting that there was some significance to it.  Everything could be destroyed today and maybe the only artifact left on earth to show that we were here was a stuffed Barney toy.  What do you think future generations are going to think of us when that's all they have to go by?  Not everything man makes is for any particular reason nor is everything that man does for a particular reason.  A lot of the supposition that goes on today is beyond ludicrous...  hell a lot of it borders on insane.  Example of the typical train of thought...  thousands of years down the road from now they find the moon landing remains up there.  Immediately, they're going to be trying to figure out why we went there and jump to conclusions that today's men were moon worshippers and we were trying to reach our god.  Why else would so much effort have been poured into something like that?  There couldn't possibly be another explanation.<br>
<br>
A nasty habit of archeologists is assuming that the generations of previous men were all guided by their instincts, immature beliefs, and couldn't possibly have been as smart, enlightenened, or emotionally balanced as the people of the current generation.  People were just as smart back then as they are today.  They simply didn't have the technical knowledge that we have today.  <br>
<br>
While everyone is looking into the past for some hidden meaning as to why we're here and how we all got here they typically ignore the present and the future.  We decide why we're here and make it to be so.  We don't need others to tell us why we're here.  We were given a destiny of our own to make.  We do what we choose to do and humanity gets define it's own purpose of being.  No mound in the ground is going to tell you why you're here or what you're here for.  You get to decide that on your own.  The peoples of the past were in exactly the same situation as we are today... they had no clue about any set program for us.   There wasn't any.  They lived life day to day just like we do today.<br>
<br>
You might find peace in the Bible or any religious book but you won't find factual detailed answers.  There's no point in trying.  That's not why those books were created.  The people who created those books knew men.  They didn't know the answers to the universe.<br>
