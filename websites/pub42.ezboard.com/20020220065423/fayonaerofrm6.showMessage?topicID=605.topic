Rangers are one of the most important classes in the game, for exploring, tracking and mapping out territory. With the new expansion coming out, having a level 60 ranger at your command will make life much easier, and your time will be much more productive knowing where you are going in the game. My character is one of the most respected and loved rangers on the server, and is in one of the best guilds on Ayonae Ro. I have played this character for two and a half years now, and he has developed into one of the top rangers on Ayonae Ro. Well lets get to his equipment now:<br>Equipment List: (broken down into categories):<br>Left Earring: Dragon's Blood Earring-- 10 AC, +7 str, +7 dex, +10 hit pts, +5 vs disease and poison.<br><br>Necklace: Silver Charm of Tranquility-- 35 AC, +10 str, +15 stam, +100 hit pts, +100 mana, +8 vs all resists.<br><br>Face/Mask: Eyepatch of Plunder-- 10 AC, +10 str, +10 dex, +50 hit pts, +6 vs all resists, effect: Captain Nalots Quickening (haste effect that stacks with other items and spells).<br><br>Head/Helm: Crown of the Kromzek Kings-- 30 AC, +50 hit pts, +25 vs magic, +10 vs all other resists, effect: Truesight (off of King Tormax in Kael).<br><br>Right Earring: Living Thunder Earring-- 10 AC, +9 str, +10 vs magic, effect: See Invisible (off of Derakor the Vindicator in Kael).<br><br><br>Left Ring Finger: Ring of Dain Frostreaver IV-- 10 AC, +10 str, +10 stam, +100 hit pts, +10 vs magic, effect: Frostreaver's Blessing (+10 ATK, +10 Damage Shield, +10 Hit Pt.

The person buying my account, is not buying any intellectual property of Verant, Inc. or Sony Interactive. The purpose of this auction is to transact the time I have spent developing my character, to another person so that they may continue to develop and play my character on this account. If you are a member of the Station Network, Verant Inc., Sony Interactive Inc., eBay, or any of their affiliated companies, you are not allowed to purchase this account. Due to Verant's strict policies of not selling accounts or in-game items, my character will not be shown in the game until payment has been received.<br>I do not accept paypal, personal checks, or business checks. I have been advised by paypal staff not to accept paypal, because paypal does not cover or insure transactions that are essentially informational, such as this one, where the buying and selling of account information is taking place. In addition, there are growing concerns of buyers canceling or claiming their credit card was stolen, to recoop their funds, then paypal goes after the seller and demands payment.<br><br>being that there is one guild on Ayonae Ro that kills Vulak, No rangers on Ayonae ro that have The Ring of Dain Frostreaver IV, multiple Vulak loots, and being that there are 1 pair of Onyx Chain Leggings, and has anyone seen a ranger roaming around norrath with a combination of this armor???<br>could we find such a better lammer then this? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uhubbestubbe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HubbeStubbe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/20/01 10:24:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=605.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The &quot;SCAMS&quot; you can come acrossed looking at E</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showMessage?topicID=1212.topic">pub42.ezboard.com/fayonae...1212.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br>Your a bit slow bro. =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showPrevMessage?topicID=605.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showNextMessage?topicID=605.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=605.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=605.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.threadControl?topicID=605.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=605.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=605.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Diplomacy Corner<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Administration Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6>NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
