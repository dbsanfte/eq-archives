Alliance members will recieve 1 point per hour up to 4 points for non planar raids and 1 point per 2 hours up to 4 points for planar raids.  <br>
<br>
1a.  One bonus point will be recived for attending the opposite plane of your armor drops.<br>
<br>
1b.  One bonus point will be recieved for staying an entire raid in cases of long raids (8+ hours) like the planes.<br>
<br>
1d. Everyone will start with 6 points.<br>
<br>
1e.  All points and attendance issues are subject to the discression of raid leaders and loot coordinators.<br>
<br>
1f.  Points will be rewarded each hour and compounded during the raid.<br>
<br>
1g.  Invites will receive points at half the rate of the alliance members, up to 2 points per raid.  Alliance members have priorty over invites when purchasing items.<br>
<br>
2. There will be no penatly for missing raids other than that you dont get the points for the raid and will have to wait longer to get points to spend on loot.<br>
<br>
3. Point Costs<br>
<br>
The old world planes: <br>
Brestplates and legs=5 points<br>
All other pieces=3 points<br>
Planar weapon=3 points<br>
<br>
Quest Armors (kael and such):<br>
Breastplate and legs=6 points<br>
All other pieces=3 points<br>
Other items=3 points<br>
<br>
Non planar raids:<br>
Weapons=3 points<br>
Armors/items=3 points<br>
<br>
Epic Pieces:<br>
No points will be spent on epic loots, they go to person farthest along, if there is a dispute over who is farthest along, it will go to ther person with the most seniority in the class.<br>
<br>
Dragon loot=6 points per piece. Only one piece per raid.<br>
<br>
4. If two people wish to buy the same piece of loot, priortiy will be given to the one who has the most seniority in the class. Only one piece of loot can be boughten until everyone of the spoken class who has the points to get loot has purchased an item. If a dispute over seniority in the class arises, the person with the most points will recieve the item.<br>
<br>
4a. If the situation arises that no one has points to buy an item such as a breastplate, the person with the most seniority in the class can spend whatever points they have (putting them at 0) to get the item.<br>
<br>
4b. If you are the only one of a certain class attending a raid and that class specific item drops, you do not need to spend points to get the item, but you will only recieve one point for the raid since you did not need to spend any. This is to preserve a balance in the case of mutliclass drops.<br>
<br>
4c. If it occurs that a raid produces such an amount of drops that everyone spends their points down to 0, the remaining drops will be randomed by those who want an item.<br>
<br>
4d. If an item drops that no one wants to spend points on, it goes to general random by those who can and will use the item. These items do not effect the ability to loot another item nor do they effect the amount of points a person has. Raid leaders/loot coordinators have the right to use this rule with discresion to prevent people from just denying spending points on items to save their points and hope for winning a random on items.<br>
<br>
5.  Plane of growth will be a random system since it is limited to who can go and I think it will be more work than what its worth to do a seperate point system for it.  This will prevent certain people from getting extra points for attending a raid not everyone can.<br>
<br>
Well, here it is with modifications.  Please give input on point totals, I kinda went through and hedged what I thought would be fair.  Gimme any input/comments/concens/wants to shoot me, etc... :P and I will edit as needed.  Hopefully we can post this for general members by the end of the week.  Cheers!<br>

      Who is going to keep track of the point system?  Any volunteers.  This is just like trying to keep track of a attendance schedule of people...when they show up and leave...etc.  It can be very hard and frustrating.  Also, usually the people do it don't like to just sit there and do that...so there are going to be some mad mistakes I'm sure.  <br>
<br>
Another thing, who has a compilation of all people in the guilds so that we can appropriately donate the first 6 points to each person.  I think we should test this out a few raids before we lay down any groundwork on it....cause it's going to be a bitz to get used to also.  Plus your going to have to kepe the list out in the open so people can see how many points they have...etc.  <br>
<br>
Who wants to write the html to throw up a link to this on the webpage also...should it be pworded so only members can get into it...or we just going to leave it out in the open for all to see.  <br>
<br>
What about people with 2 toons...maybe I skipped this above.  Most commonly I play 2 toons on planar raids usually...cyph for damage...rhonin for cr's. <br>
<br>
I feel PoG should not recieve any points for going since all can't attend.  It would really suck to be a ranger and other people getting more points then you on a zone that you cannot attend in.  I mean...who really wants to run around and track mobs so other people can get xp/drops?  I sure wouldn't want to for just a few points.<br>
<br>
Just a little input I thought I'd throw in.  This is a good start...but lots of little issues need to be gone over before we just lay this into effect.  Nice start though Dine.<br>

We just need two people from ecah guild now to set up spreadsheets, I will work on getting a current active DS roster up for the loot list.  On people who have two toons we have to options to chose from:  1.  One pool of points per toon, whatever toon is running gets to spend points/gain points for the pool.  2.  Each toon has its own pool and one can only gain points for that toon and spend them when the toon is running.  No switching between toons to buy items and such to make it fair.  All I can think of right now, keep the input coming and lets put this in place.<br>

<br>
The point pool per toon is probably the best option so we are comparing apples to apples, or in this case, so my necro isn't spending my warriors points against other necros.<br>
<br>
What about people that are running more than one toon per raid simultaneously?  Bren I know sometimes runs Gath when the raid runs late and he has to go to bed.  Will points per toon cover that sufficiently?<br>
<br>
The only thing that is missing is what constitutes a points raid.  We were saying 3+ groups, but should we put an advanced notice limit on things?  To qualify to be a points raid it has to be posted at least 3 days in advance maybe?<br>
<br>
Example, we get a wild hair on a slow night and decide to do a spur of the moment kedge raid.  Phinny is up and we wanna take him out &lt;hands napkin to Bren&gt;, we probably need more horsepower than can be mustered just with the OBS online, so we put out the call to DS.  It is a slow night for you guys too and there are only a few online, we manage to get a couple of people to show up, but only 2 or 3, and the rest of the say 4 groups are OBS.  Or if the situation is reversed with DS doing the impromptu and OBS not fielding many if any.  Does that make a points raid?<br>
<br>
What if it is posted for however long and one or the other guild either doesn't show at all or shows with only a couple of people?  Still points raid?<br>
<br>
I am not bitching, just thinking out loud.<br>

You spend points on an item and then you can't spend points again till everyone gets something, correct?  As in, hate bracer drops, Az buys it, is out of the rotation no matter his point total till all warriors have gotten something.<br>
<br>
What about weapons?  I know we are spending the same points on them as we would on armor, but Kael last week, there were good plate drops and there were a couple of weapon drops.  If I spend my points to buy a bit of armor, do I have to wait on spending any more if a weapon drops or are they considered seperate for the purposes of bidding eligibility?<br>
<br>
Also, say we have 4 warriors on Hate, 3 alliance and an invite.  The invite has no points, when we get to the 4th armor drop (I am assuming a bit here, hehe) what happens?  All alliance members have spent their points on the drops so far, does he/she just get the item?  Do they spend their meager point stash (probably a point or two at that point) on it?  Do we random it?<br>

<br>
Maybe spontaneous raids of 3 or more groups could qualify as a single point.  That way unplanned raids don't put others (the people who attend the scheduled raids) out too badly. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uneaadan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Neaadan</A> at: 2/14/02 2:28:14 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uazerik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Azerik</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Administrator</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#0000FF>(2/14/02 2:25:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fallianceraidforumfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.tripod.com/eqblacksun/images/khorne.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: One other thought</span><hr size=1> Will it just be &quot;tough luck&quot; if we get a one sided raid that was posted for the requisite time?<br>

I thought I would throw in My 2 cents on this topic.<br>
I really like what I am seeing, and would like to share my thoughts to see what you all think.<br>
<br>
1. Loot system once in place needs to be clearly posted on the General forums of each website ( OotBS, Alliance, Dragonlayers). This will be done once it is solidified..so i know this is coming.<br>
<br>
2. Alternate loot systems in place. No offense meant..but not everyone is gonna like this system..it penalizes the casual players who are not online 24/7 like some of us are. I would like to see a separate set of loot rules that could be used on any given day whether it be a scheduled planned raid or the impromptu ones. This system could be simply random roll All. So whoever is in attendance gets a shot whether they be allied, or guests and regardless on whether they have 500 points to spend or none. It also may be used on any raid of any magnitude. I guarantee you will see tremendous support on events planned that use this system as the casual players will know they have a &quot;shot&quot; at loot.<br>
<br>
3. Each raid that is scheduled has the specific loot system to be used posted in advance. I want no questions on any future raids we do. <br>
Therefore, as an example:<br>
Hate raid, July 4th 2002. Loot system: Points. Epic drops too: Magas, Sokarxx. First BP to Azerik, Etc.<br>
This is clear...and lets players know what to expect.<br>
<br>
4. I would like, as Morale officer in OotBS..the permission to give out ( as rewards for the fun things I have planned) Points that can be used in the raids.<br>
For example..I have a naked Ogre race coming soon..it would be cool if the reward for the winner could be points. This would encourage attendance at the fun events coming up and also puts less pressure on me to try to come up with &quot;awesome prizes&quot; to events I plan. <br>
I will post specifcs on events I intend to run in the officers sections so that you all can veto or ok possible rewards i want to put in place.<br>
<br>
Well that is all i have to add to this system...I am encouraged by what I have seen..and hope you guys are interested in some of my ideas here.<br>
