She was a bard, and it was her night to entertain the audience. She made good tips in this place, and the later and drunker the audience got the easier they were parted with their money.<br>
<br>
She had noticed the tension as the dark ones had entered the Inn, and how the paladins had covered their swords with their hands in preparation.<br>
<br>
Fights were bad for business, and bad for her tips.<br>
<br>
She saw the dark elf slide up close to the Innkeep and whisper something, no doubt a threat of some sort to his ear, as the color drained from his face. Casidy was not the only one to see this, the tension in the room could be cut with a knife.<br>
<br>
Sighing softly to herself, why does it always have to happen on my night she thought. A plan quickly formed in her mind how to dissipate the building tension, she just hoped that the dark ones would go along with her plan.<br>
<br>
While she had her resolve firmly in hand, she rose quickly and ran up to embrace the one speaking at the counter. Throwing her arms around the strangers neck, she purred out &quot;Cousin, what brings you to these parts, and on my entertaining night?&quot; winking softly to the person in her arms, but feeling a blade slide up to touch her ribs. <br>
<br>
&quot;Have you been so desiring of my music to travel so far and long to hear me play?&quot; Her eyes pleading with the dark one to follow her story.<br>
<br>
Turning to the Innkeep, Casidy threw on her best smile. &quot;Innkeep, a round for my cousins, and the best room in the house. I, of course, will cover the cost.&quot;<br>

Almost.  An admonishing glance from my master was enough to remind me of my place... and the statements I had made already.  I had requested peace, despite the color of my skin; should I not now offer the same?  Carefully, I released my claymore's hilt, and slipped from her grip.  I have no doubt that her puny dagger would be ineffective against my dwarven-forged banded mail, but dwarves have a tendency to offer their services to anyone... yet leave certain things unsaid, or undone.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, ah, my... lady,&quot; I said, trying not to let my instinctive feelings show.  &quot;We are quite fond of... the... ah, music here.&quot;<br>
<br>
My master, always the tactful one, added, &quot;Quite fine music, as well.  Perhaps some day you could play to our people in Neriak.&quot;<br>
<br>
I sized up my opponent (perhaps, at the time, not the most accurate wording, but the only one I know to use.)  It didn't seem like she would pose a challenge, but one can never be certain.  Besides, I had demanded peace, and it was only proper that I offered that I demanded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Perhaps you could spin us a tale,&quot; I said to her as I brought our drinks to Vanlaans table.  Suddenly, an idea caught me, and I smiled to myself.  &quot;After all, I am merely a dark elf, and no songsmith such as yourself.  I'm certain that you would be able to awe me with tales of your life.  Certainly, one such as I could never match your tales.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vanlaan gave me an odd look, which I ignored.  It was likely that I had a thing or two to show my master; after all, he had never attended my sermons to the Dismal Rage.  It was not the night for combat, but that did not mean it wasn't a night for competition... <p>Innoruuk Guides My Path,

<br>
As a magic user, Vanlaan was trained to recognize fellow magic users.  Quietly scoping the tavern, Vanlaan noticed the robed figure in the corner almost immediately.  It wasn't hard to notice the fact that no one sat at any of the surrounding tables.  Vanlaan looked over at Aedare.  Although Aedare was quite capable of taking care of herself, Vanlaan was responsible for her actions and didn't want her causing trouble.  Not here.  Not now.  They needed to keep a low profile for the time being.  Aedare was occupied with teasing the bard.  Well, that was fine.  There shouldn't be too much harm in competition tale-telling.  He had to feel sorry for the bard though; she really had no idea what she was getting herself into.<br>
<br>
Deciding that Aedare was occupied in a non-violent way, Vanlaan got up and made his way towards the back of the tavern.  He tried to act casual, but a Dark Elf Necromancer is anything but inconspicuous.  He mentally shrugged.  'Oh well,' he thought, 'I certainly won't draw anymore attention then our entrance already drew.'  As he approached the table, he noticed the lone figure was watching him.  If he wasn't mistaken, there was a lizard snout poking out from underneath the cowl of the stranger's hood.  'More and more interesting,' he thought.<br>
<br>
He sat down at the table and studied the stranger for a moment.  &quot;Can I buy you a drink?&quot;, he asked.  &quot;I noticed you watching my companion and I as we came in.  Is there something I can help you with?&quot;  He sat back and took a sip of the swill this Inn labeled ale.  He was very interested to hear what the stranger had to say. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=qwik>Qwik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/4/01 8:31:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: story continued</span><hr size=1> just as a kunak rhino in an erudite china shop a taller man with an air of playfullness to him comes down the stairs loudly from the rooms on the second floor. glancing around still trying to get his bearings after a rest from training all day with his brothers of the ashen order he sits down with a flask of mead with a loud well deserved sigh. surveying the room he notices an uneasy crowd all murmering about something he just couldnt seem to make out.

It appeared that he would not have to wait much longer to speak with them...not much longer at all.  However, for as much as he had been trying to speak with them, he dreaded it.  Though he had a good understanding of Common in the time he had been away from home, it was physicly painfull for him to form the words.  And this he did not looke forward to.  But try he must.  He needed allies in this land.<br>
<br>
Quitely he watched as the one he had learned was named Vanlaan aproached.  He sat down next to him and said nothing at first.  They both sat in silence, eyeing each other up.  Then finaly Vanlaan spoke.  <br>
&quot;Can I buy you a drink?&quot;.  The question was completely unexpected.  Drakhnar chuckled slightly and the question that followed was more the one he expected.  &quot;I noticed you watching my companion and I as we came in. Is there something I can help you with?&quot; Vanlaan said.  Drahnar thought for a second, he had to choose his words carefully.  Finaly he spoke in a tone he hoped was low enough that the others in the Inn would not hear.  &quot;Yesss, I have been following for sssome time.  I have been wanting to sssspeak with you.  Firssst I want you to know that I mean you and your friend no harm.  I sssimply asssk that you hear me out.  Asss for the drink, I would like another yesss.&quot;<br>

<br>
&lt;Note: I used the name Drakhnar here before I registered...was having difficulty doing so.  But when I finaly got in to register, the name was taken.&gt;<br>
