<br>
For those of you that do not already know, I quit EQ after the Chardok raid.  I felt I needed to explain myself in detail so you did not feel it was just because we didn’t get the kill of the Overking.  <br>
<br>
I have recently been under a great deal of stress and still am in my real life.  I recently moved to a new state leaving my family behind and struggled to find a new job.  I have since found a new job and am struggling with my 13 yr old son that thinks he doesn’t have to come home after school and doesn’t have to listen while I am 30 miles away at work and there is really nothing I can do since I am new at my job.  And even when I ground him he still doesn’t listen. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   He makes sure he is home just before I am to make the appearance he has been home.  He has some actual problems he takes medication for that contributes to his behavioral problems which makes it even harder for me to handle him.  There are other issues in my real life that are there also I wont go into.<br>
<br>
As for EQ, in the beginning it was a place to go when my real life friends were busy.  Then I made friends with people and it became a place to be more often then not.  Since I was a single mother and my real life friends were married we didn’t get together as much.  EQ because the place for me to be and enjoy.  I have dedicated my time in EQ to helping those around me.  You always hear about the “greedy” clerics.  Well I am not one of them.  Those of you that have played with me know that.  And those that haven’t I hope maybe have heard. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
Something that bothered me to know end and this is part of why I am frustrated with EQ, is after all the help I have given to others.  And I don’t usually expect anything back.  But everyone once in a while desires help or looks for the returned favor.  There have been people that I have become EQ friends with that had said they would be there for me when the time came for killing the Overking.  Of those people that said they would be there months ago, ONLY 1 person came.  That person was Selil. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Trebori came who is a new friend for just a short time.  I cant be upset at the friends that had to work.  But some of them just had bigger and better things to do.  Should I be upset at that?  I don’t know.  Is it wrong to be?  I don’t know.  But I am.  And I am Sorry.  I am even upset because there are so many other guild members that didn’t show.  And maybe they couldn’t come.  But they didn’t even say in the forum, “sorry have to work”  “ Sorry have real life plans”.  And some of those people I was at their epic raids, as was Yandadara, Zoto, Azerik. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
You all probably read this and think to yourself, Geez its just a game.  And the problem is, it IS just a game.  But I have seemed to take it to another level.  I have gotten to personally attached.  I have cared to much.  With the stress in my life.  With the frustrations in the game and the few things I want to accomplish that I seem to not be able to achieve, I am unhappy.  I shouldn’t be crying when I am playing EQ over stupid stuff.  I fight more with the people I love the most, my kids and boyfriend.<br>
<br>
I wrote this to explain myself.  I didn’t want you to think it was just because we didn’t kill Overking.  It was just another added frustration to me.  I had said to Tabalar before the raid that if we don’t kill him, I was going to quit.  I said that to him because at that point from all that I have explained, it is so hard for me to handle let down and disappointment.  Hard for me to look forward and see, “we will come back and try again”.  Funny thing is that is my outlook to everyone else but not to myself.<br>
<br>
I have been playing EQ now for 1 yr and 4 months.  I have never taken a break except for 1 wk while I moved apartments in CA and 1 wk when I moved from CA to WA.  I feel the need to quit the game.  Tabalar and others have told me just to take a break.  Maybe I should just take a break.  I just know I am unhappy and sad in my real life and EQ life.  <br>
<br>
I know that it will be extremely hard for me to stay gone because I care for so many of you.  I will miss you dearly.<br>
<br>
With deepest regards,<br>
<br>

<br>
I want to thank all of you that have given me such a wonderful out pouring of love and support. It is greatly appreciated, more than you all probably know.<br>
<br>
Though things are still not easy with my son. I have had sometime to regroup within myself and time to focus on what is important and what I would like to do in my real life and eq life. And since doing this and having many people say they miss me, as do I miss so many of you, I have decided to come back. Not sure when this will be, but I am coming back. And when I do come back, my hours may be different. It's all kinda up in the air at this time. I just know I want to try to focus on what's important to me first and that is my kids and boyfriend.<br>
<br>
I look forward to seeing you all soon. I have truly missed you all.<br>
