That has been at least 8 months or so. We have never even come close to breaking up in that time. I'm no sure where you get your information, but maybe check your sources. If something IS a true &quot;pickup raid for a dragon or such&quot; then often loot can go to whomever randoms and wins, but that is on nonguild raids, just friends from several guilds getting together. I personally lost an item to an alt that I would have very much liked on a pickup raid for Trak with a few other guilds.  <p><HTML><BODY>

<br>
First, within minutes of the time the warrior sent me a tell saying he was up, at least half a dozen other people in Vision knew he was up.  His &quot;tip&quot; was nice, but not needed.  It also wasn't motivated (as far as I can tell) by a desire to help us.  It was motivated by a desire to get him a shot at a Green Dragonscale.<br>
<br>
Second, we could have killed it without him.  He ~certainly~ helped, and for being one of 30 or so people killing the dragon, he got a 1 in 9 chance of getting a 200kpp scale.<br>
<br>
He got as much of a chance as any INDIVIDUAL warrior at the event.  It's more than we owed him, it's more than most others would have given him.<br>
<br>
We didn't dictate the terms.  He sent the tell to me asking for a fair chance, and we gave him that.  Perhaps you should ask around, find out who it is, and ask him if he thinks he got a fair shot at it before you come here on his behalf and badmouth us.<br>

So let me guess..<br>
<br>
your guilds method of loot distibution is much better than this..you allow members both new and old to COMPETE for loot by rolling for it?  <br>
<br>
Either way..who the hell are you to stand on a soapbox and preach about how OUR internal looting system conflicts with ...what...your view on how it should be done?<br>
<br>
I refuse to lotto guild items, and have not participated in a guild lotto in over a year.....I play with my friends, we are adult enough to figure out who should get what...<br>
<br>
we don't need some crackpot sherlock holmes thinking they know the scoop...WHICH THEY OBVIOUSLY DO NOT....coming to the community boards and trying to spice up a lame thread...by flaming my guild policys..when they are not even a member<br>

I thought you'd said he was well respected, not a loot hungry fella like you're implying now. From your log he  doesn't seem like the &quot;L3wtz plzkkthx&quot; type of person. <br>
<br>
Now even if someone's after loot -which in the end most are- i find it funny that you'd possibly deny someone a chance to roll on x loot after they had a hand in procuring it.<br>
<br>
You even say you didn't owe him any chance at the scale. Hell you didn't NEED him to kill it after all.<br>
<br>
I'm not complaining about how you distribute loot, i really don't give a damn. I just find it amusing that you value loot so highly as to say all that about not owing and not needing then preach about loot distribution )<br>
<br>
Mighty White, yessir.<br>
<br>
That'd be my response after seeing how thankful i should be for getting to roll on it- after all you don't owe me that much, and you didn't need lil ol me to kill him anyway. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/utreistaania.showPublicProfile?language=EN>treistaania</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/14/02 10:13:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=804.topic&index=119>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I don't hate you Blizz</span><hr size=1> ahhh so i was flaming your guilds policy?  its nice that you inform me.. now move along Mr god i dont belive in you anyway.<br>
<br>
my guild uses raid point system and if you have positive points then you get to roll on that item " IF YOU WANT TO" but if someone has higher points then you then they may choose to limit the rolls and a point check is made.. this never happends due to that there is no greed from anyone and everyone is given a fair chance..<br>
<br>
if there is any form of agitation over a loot issue EX: member A starts t fight about wanting it. then the item will get destroyed ... end of story and everyone knows this and there arent any fights over loot.<br>
<br>
what i ment about getting key classes equipped before others is that if a plate bp drops in HoT then why should it go to warriors before other classes? a warrior does not have any more use of it then a cleric a bard or a shadowknight.. infact it can be argued that the warrior is the one that needs it less then those others since the warrior already has superior ac and hp over the rest.<br>
<br>
a system can only be fair if everyone participating gets a shot at an item they want.<br>
<br>
all players in everquest are individuals and you all play because you like the game.. and giving loot to certain people before others will never make anything faster.. <br>
<br>
and im sorry if i flamed someone by saying i know vision members that thought of quitting due to the palimax vision.. well when someone tells me "the way pali handles things at times makes me keep an eye out for another guild" then i asume that is what they ment.<br>
and since i am not and never will be a Vision member i can not know how its really handled.<br>
<br>
really sorry if this offended so much..<br>

Who's implying that he was loot hungry?  I just said that it SEEMS TO ME that his <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> primary</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> motivation in providing us with the information was to get himself a chance at a Green Scale.<br>
<br>

<br>
I said, &quot;respected-by-us,&quot; also, not &quot;well,&quot; although I won't split hairs.  I just dislike being misquoted.

We would have found the dragon without him.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Other peopl ein Vision had already found him independant of my announcing it in /gu.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  One of my wizards knew earlier.

...and I'm telling you that if someone in Vision is complaining about loot, then it's becuase they haven't taken an active role in working out their classes loot policies.  The MEMBERS of Vision make the loot policy, not me.  The officers arbitrate when people can't agree, but the MEMBERS make the policy.  Similarly, if they're complaining to you, they're NOT doing it to us.  Nobody in Vision has anybody to complain to about the quality of items that they're getting than THEMSELVES.<br>
<br>
I don't deny that some of Vision's members might be shopping for other gulids; and that it might be because of loot.  I'm just telling you that if they are, it's because they aren't trying to work with their class and with their guild to make the system better. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4868>Palimax Sceleris</a>,

You agree with this?<br>

Again, belittling someone's help, if they were 1 person in 3 or 1 in 100 is pretty screwy. <br>

What's worse is doing it again and again. Then you wonder how moronic i have to be to not understand that you didn't need someone's help and didn't owe that someone(who helped you) a chance at the reward for the endeavor(because of how little their help actually was).<br>

<br>
As we saw it, we had three options.  (a)Tell him we didn't need his help, and kill it without him, thus ensuring that if he dropped a scale it would go to a warrior in Vision. (b)Tell him thanks for the info, you're welcome to assist us and in return you'll be given a MORE THAN FAIR chance at the scale, or (c)Tell him he can help, but he's not getting a shot at the scale.<br>

We choose (b) because Allamar agreed with me that it was the right thing to do.  How many other guilds would have chosen (a) or (c)?<br>

A question for every guildleader here:  If your guild had the power to kill Severlous without the assistance of one warrior from Vision, would they have given one warrior in Vision an 11% chance at the scale for telling you something you already knew, and helping you do something you could do without him?<br>
<br>
What you don't seem to understand is that we ~LET~ him help.  His guild wasn't in a position to do it, and ours was.  We did him a favor, not the other way around.<br>
<br>
28 members of Vision (or so my last /who showed), roughly one group of assorted friends, and one <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;somewhat well-equipped bard&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> from EW killed the Dragon.  When it died, it dropped one of the most valuable traded items in the game (ask Arbok what the current offer for his Green Dragonscale is), and we gave him a better chance at it than most warriors on this server will EVER see.<br>
<br>
Since Arbok's consideres the Green Scale a trade item, there must be at least one guild on the server that would have assumed a FAIR shot at it would have been 30-to-1, not 9-1.  (I'm not picking on Arbok, I'm just demonstrating that the scale is worth 200k to a monk, just as much as it is to a warrior.)<br>
<br>
You're right.  We're bad bad men and we did a terrible thing for a terrible reason. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4868>Palimax Sceleris</a>,

I will be the first to tell you loot is my one of my favorite and one of my least favorite aspects of this game. I love getting a new shiny trinket. I hate it when as a guild we have decide who is deserving of said shiny trinket. My dream is that we all will get the shiny trinket one day.  I go to the Halls of Testing every Wed (and sometimes on spur of the moment raids) in hopes of getting my fellow clerics closer to completing a set of armor. I will not truly enjoy my armor until I can share that joy with the rest of them.<br>
<br>
Vision has never come close to disbanding, tempers have flared. People have left. People have come back and left again. Some people have left, asked to come back and we tell them no. The thing that binds us the most is we respect each other.  <p><HTML><BODY>

<br>
Problem with this enlies in situations like this:<br>
<br>
Guild raids uhh, some random dragon.<br>
<br>
RBG drops.  WarriorA, who has been a longtime member of the guild, who has attended many, many dragon raids and has lost all of the rolls, is still in an FBSS.  WarriorB, who is wearing Some_No_Drop_Uber_Haste_Item_1%_less_haste_than_RBG, has only been in the guild one week, and rarely attends raids.  They both roll.  WarriorA loses to WarriorB.<br>
<br>
A few days later, WarriorB has quit the guild and is seen auctioning the RBG in EC.<br>
<br>
Moral of the story:  Open roll sucks.  The only thing you are achieving by advocating this way of deciding loot is making yourself look like a loot whore.<br>
<br>
However, I am a skeptic of the system Vision uses.  I do think there are better ways to handle loot than to have it decided between one person or a group of people.  Just too many issues such as favoritism, or a certain class officer not being online at the time, and there's no possible way these people are going to know every single member of the guild well.  But, it is still a much better system than others, and the majority of the members of Vision feel that it works for them just fine.  I imagine most members of Vision trust their officers with this power, and feel that they will make good decisions.<br>
<br>
This system, as well as the 'point system' benefit the guild much as a whole.  The point system especially, makes sure that items go to a person who is definitely going to put it to use the most.  If you're often going to raids, you're going to get a lot of points towards loot.  It's not very good handing a Paladin a CoF who only logs in once a month, as he's not going to put it to much use.  Additionally, it encourages members to attend raids in which they have no shot at loot, such as a Wizard at a guild raid for the first floor of PoH:  nothing drops for them there (I think).  However, rather than possibly being bored, they know they can get points for attending this raid.<br>
<br>
However, bottom line:  If you don't like the loot rules, you don't have to join Vision.  It seems to work for Vision just fine.<br>
<br>
Oh, and bottom line#2:<br>

<br>
We've tested a point system for the guild as a whole, and we've found, overall, that it didn't work for us.  From time to a time a member suggets it, and when presented with the reasons it didn't work for us last time, they're generally unable to make it work for us.<br>
<br>
OTOH, there are some individual spawns that drop multi-class loot that we are experimenting with specific &quot;scorekeeping&quot; systems.  We use a by class point total for Scout Charisa, and thusfar, it works well.  Every time a member of your class attends a kill, that class scores a point, and when your class it on top of the list, your class loots it and loses a group's worth of points.  We still think it's fairer than individual point keeping for the spawn, and it's settled all discussion about who's turn it was to hand the item in or loot the reward.  [The wizards are, of course, secretly plotting to take the next four or five loots and make robes out of spite...]  We've never yet had a problem where the clerics (or any other class) in attendance couldn't decide which one of them should get the item, or disgruntled clerics getting upset that their points get &quot;spent&quot; while they're offline.<br>
<br>
Every system has flaws.<br>
<br>

I, as well, find it facinating as well that people seem to quick to bash a system that's working QUITE well for us.<br>
<br>
(Ok, others are pointing out that our policies aren't working out for us, but again, I submit, if there is an upset minority shopping new guilds because our loot policy stinks, then it's because they're not working to make it a better system; probably because they're too busy looking for new guilds.) <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4868>Palimax Sceleris</a>,

Of course he deserved a chance....  ...once we decided to let him help.  Considering Serv being up wasn't exactly news, and we didn't exactly need him*, why do you think he deserved to be included in the raid?<br>

Allamar and my decision was, in short, if we should allow him to help us or not, because if we did, we'd feel obligated to give him a shot at the scale...  ...which we did.
