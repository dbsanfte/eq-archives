<br>
I agree with this and all we can dis either In character: Be happy that the evil forces give us time and are not strong enough to attack us already, or then ooc: Be pissed at Verant for letting us wait and not finishing what they started.<br>
<br>
However I am SURE EVERYTHING we are expecting WILL happen. The signs are clear and the story of Norrath simply points it out.<br>
<br>
Here I have copied Lord Banegrivms actual post about all the concerns and frustration.<br>
People attacked him personally and he is defending himself, which he really has the right to, since I believe in his words and his cause.<br>
<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
<br>
Connections, am I convinced that Runnyeye and the Sleeper are involved in things? No, Not yet. Do I suspect they may be involved? Yes. I know the leader of the Ring of Scale wants the Sleeper to awaken whose spirit now rests in the Dragon Necropolis. Jared Dar I believe. Do I believe Cazic Thule and Bertoxxulous and their worldly retainers may be in cahoots? Yes I do, all based upon things that I have found<br>
<br>
A Teir`Dal and a Koada`Dal stand before you. They are each holding identical stones behind their backs. The Teir`Dal says the stone is black. The Koada`Dal says the stone is white. Which do you believe?<br>
<br>
Because you are on the side of light, because you would sooner trust a High Elf than a Dark Elf, you would believe the Koada`Dal, yes?<br>
<br>
No I don't. I find out more BEFORE, I make a decision. I know that I have seen dark elves that are kind and compassionate and that I know I have seen supposed high elven paladins that are anything but. As to Melondar...I believe Arrathorn said it best. He KNEW about all this BEFORE, ANY of it happened on ANY server. He was speaking with people long before the outbreak of the plague on ANY server and was there at Qeynos when the Hoax happened. <br>
<br>
Arrathorn, as to your question...I have not once stated anywhere &quot;Melondar said XXXX&quot; He is best described as a Merlin figure. Again, there have been reports of &quot;Merlin's&quot; on other servers as well. Remember about Merlin to Arthur's court, how often did he EVER give a DIRECT answer? There is your answer. Believe me there are times speaking with him I want to pull my hair out LOL! <br>
<br>
As to the core of whats happened and been happening, I've been following things since day one...I payed attention, I role played my character and enjoyed the storylines to quests and had FUN doing so. The reward for me was NOT the loot, it was the fantasy story that was made in following a storyline in the process of it all and the aventure that was had along the way. If you pay attention to the GM events, the quests, the faction hits, the stories told as you follow through the quests...you will find ALOT that you never KNEW about. Ever stop and smell the roses? <br>
<br>
Everything that has been DISCOVERED was JUST THAT, DISCOVERED! Alot has been posted, and ALOT of what I said seems to have slipped through the cracks. Prime example and possible reason to explain some things here that I have mentioned. Lanys SAID ther would be war HERSELF. She SAID that SHE was going to HELP the coming off Bertoxxulous, HERSELF. She also SWEARS to destroy Firiona Vie AND Tunare. She has allied with who? Mayong Mistmoore! Now if they are allying, and they can all find &quot;common ground&quot;, then why not unite, join forces, dispatch all your possible enemies in one fell swoop and then you can worry about malcontents. Put yourselves in THEIR boots once.<br>
<br>
Ask yourself what would YOU do if YOU were Lanys or YOU were Mayong Mistmoore or Venril Sathir for that matter. Interesting...they all don't seem to like Firiona Vie that much, do they? Look again at EVERYTHING. Its not just one or two things that happen its the COLLECTIVE SUM of EVERYTHING that we know, EVERYTHING that we have SEEN with our OWN eyes. LOOK! It's there! EVERYTHING!<br>
<br>
Now as to other items of note. How long are we going to debate about Melondar now for? I've said MANY relevant items of note, it keeps getting swept under the covers, WHY? I posted a few things recently and no one bothered to look. If they did they didn't mention it.<br>
<br>
Now who or what Melondar is we may NEVER know. Its a possibility and something we HAVE to accept. Flat out, plain and simple, its a FACT. The FACTS are THINGS are happening, and they will KEEP happening. Now we can DO SOMETHING about it OR we can stand around with our hands in our pockets and keep talking about something none of us may never have an answer to and let the greatest thing thats ever happened in EverQuest slip through the cracks.<br>
<br>
I don't plan on sitting idley by and letting this go. I BELIEVE and I believe for what I have SEEN with my OWN eyes anD what I have RESEARCHED! I LOOKED! I SAW! This IS real. Something IS happening and no matter what anyone says or does there is NO off switch to it all. Something WILL happen.<br>
<br>
As to the matter of posting and such. These ARE public forums open for EVERYONES enjoyment not just the 1st Fist of Light. Now on that note, I realize some people may be a bit gruffer and perhaps more raw then others and I also understand that others might be highly eloquent and such. All the way across the board lets remember to please be courteous and respectful to each other here, as Ladies and Gentleman.<br>
<br>
Personally I have NO problems with people disagreeing with me AT ALL. I am not perfect by any means, I am not always right by any means. Look at some of my earlier statements, I was off in some areas until I later found out for myself by adventuring through Norrath AND being CORRECTED by people as well. I would rather be proven that I am wrong in something then to go down a path being wrong thinking that I am right. I appreciate honesty and being approached with corrections. Why shouldn't I? Especially when the end result is a better me.<br>
<br>
Again, lets remember these are public forums for all. Lets also respect peoples opinions wether we agree or disagree. Not a hard thing to do and I think the majority of the posters here are all mature and respectfull individuals. <br>
<br>
On that note I have an announcement. As a result of the success of these threads and the amounts of posts and the like as well as side threads started, I am going to be making a seperate message board this evening called &quot;The Great War of Norrath&quot;. This board will be accessible off the fist site located at www.1fol.cjb.net by clicking on the &quot;Message Board&quot; link on the left hand side of the main page. I will be taking both war threads and moving them over to the new boards as soon as they are up.<br>
<br>
Again, lets remember to keep things civil here and continue to enjoy what we all have started and flourished in. I am very honored to be able to be here and to be able to help in any way shape or form that I can for the whole of the community as a whole and look forward to the things we can hope to accomplish in the end.<br>
