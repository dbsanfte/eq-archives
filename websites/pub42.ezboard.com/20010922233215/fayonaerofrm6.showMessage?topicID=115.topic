<br>
One says that flaming is the purpose of this forum, and that people who don't like to flame should get out.<br>
<br>
The other says that if some people are less then totally nice, then I as admin should shut them up.<br>
<br>
I have to strongly disagree with both sides.<br>
<br>
While flames can sometimes be very entertaining to read, serious and respectful discussions are much preferable. Flaming, rudeness, whining, senseless bitching, repeating ones opinions over and over without adding new arguments, and so on, these behaviors are not preferred. However, if I tell someone to be more intelligent or kind or understanding or whatever might be lacking, he is much more likely to feel (and unless he's ironic, say) &quot;yeah, right&quot; rather then &quot;oh, i just felt a strange power blooming up inside my soul. I'm a better person now then a few moments ago, thank you very much.&quot; It doesn't work that way.<br>
<br>
I don't like to shut people up, and in my experience it's more often then not very contraproductive to do so. Most flames have the potential to develop into more fruitful discussions, and if a post contain rudeness it doesn't automatically mean that it doesn't contain words of wisdom as well.<br>
<br>
That's why we have the NAG board. If you don't like flames, then say so. It is your right to tell them they are being rude and shouldn't be, just like it's their right to tell you they think you are a moron. But if you can't stand flames at all, then please stick to the other sections of this board. Would be a shame, since many of the most interesting discussions are here. In any case, it's your choise.<br>
<br>
If you feel the urge to be insulting, please keep it to this section for everyones sake and  so we admins don't have to have a headache about keeping the other sections tidy. However, it might be wise to resist the urge. Your reputation is the sum of what people think of you, and if you dismiss anyone who disagree with you as a moron then a lot of people will dismiss you as a moron no matter how intelligent you really are.<br>
<br>
If you want a thread closed or reopened or whatever, by all means contact me or Kivorn a some people have done recently. (Or Sithray for that matter, although he havn't been online for quite a while.) We will consider all requests on a case by case basis. But if you want the NAG-board to be more harshly moderated, don't have too high hopes about it. It is working as intended. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
On other boards there isn't a designated 'flame' section, but the same rule applies.  If you get offended, it's your own problem, not the writer's.  You stop being offended immediately by not reading it and move on.  On this board, there's this fine line for the reader called the "NAG" board.  Stuff on the NAG board might very well be offensive.  That's all the 'moderation' needed.  If you can't handle it, get out of the thread. ;)<br>

Obviously some people do wanna share theire bad experiences with the rest of us and perhaps check if we have been through something simular, alot of the times this turns into mad flaming as we just saw..<br>

But I do not belive in censoring (how the hell do I spell that?) nor a friendlier level on the nag board.. then it would not be a nag =)<br>

If people are too sensitive and get their feelings easily hurt they shouldn't be here, and I will be the first one to say that to their faces.
