OK, WHAT'S THE DAMAGE:<br>
<br>
(0-50) - Not uber. You also bathe regularly, pay all your bills, and spend quality time with your family.<br>
<br>
(51-100) - Still not uber. However, you wish you were. One day you'll have item/level/rank/title &quot;X&quot;!!<br>
<br>
(101-200) - Almost uber! You've got problems. Look, brush your teeth. Stop downloading porno. The 14-year old girls in the chat room aren't impressed by your level 60 Shadow Knight.<br>
<br>
(201+) - YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY UBER. Congratulations! You are also a waste of a human being, and are breathing air that a productive person could use to cure cancer or invent a pollution-free source of energy. On the plus side, wood elf cyber is available at your command, and in-game you are the envy of everyone who has to log off for hours at a time to deal with something called &quot;real life.&quot; Whatever that is. <br>

<br>
Though I think that it is a bit off as it can't probably account for somethings:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 15. Do you use your computer for anything non-EQ related? (-1 points)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Yea, work. That's right. I get to play EQ at work on my work computer. In fact I have two work computers right next to each other... you would think that being able to play EQ on the company hardware would be worth points. Especially since I can play EQ during work hours on rare occasions.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 18. Have you ever read a race/class/tradeskill strategy guide? (1 point)<br>
19. Did you take notes? (2 points)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Nowhere does it ask if you wrote the strategy guide or maintain a website about EQ or both. Again more stuff that should ding me with points.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I have more than one account. Something else that this test isn't taking into account.<br>
