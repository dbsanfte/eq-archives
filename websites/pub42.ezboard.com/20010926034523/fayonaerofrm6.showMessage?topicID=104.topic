<br>
I was in a 4r / emp group last night around 3AM CST we had just killed the Emp and gotten the sword of crap ...<br>
<br>
Nathsar Greatsword<br>
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM <br>
Skill: 2HS  Atk Delay: 30<br>
DMG: 17<br>
+10 STR<br>
WT: 10.0<br>
<br>
Not very impressive stats, after killing Blood we head out to clear the 4r spawn one last time before we call it a night. Once we clear the spawn we all roll on the sword. Warpd had looted it from the emp and a Wizard from SoP had won the sword by highest roll. Warpd, stands there like a jack ass for a good 4 or 5 min, while we all keep asking him to please hand over the sword so the Wizard can evacuate us to the zone in. Finally we threaten to kick him out of the group and leave him here to die if he did not hand over the sword. His reply <br>
<br>
&quot;I'll just have a necro do a summon&quot; <br>
<br>
So we left him in 4r and he did die. The thing is that sword is a POS -- and Warpd has not only turned his rep. to shit but also Undead Lords name. I probably will not group w/ any UDLs anymore becuase of his style of play -- and I am sorry that 1 player can cause so much damage. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   If any UDL members read this Post I would seriously suggest taking some action aginst this player. If I wanted to play a game full fo Jack asses I'd play Q3. Maybe if Warpd goes pissing off a few more guild he'll just have to solo. Either he plays his class poorly anyhow. Not to mention taking whats not his. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><BR><BR>Peridots for Rune V 1000 pp<BR>

<br>
Anyway, if you want to rape a guild's rep over one instance by a member before talking to the officers or the leader (myself) then I would recommend ya go fuck yourself and play Q3.  I can't really say we're anxious to get in a group with ya either.  If ya did group with anymore of us, you probably wouldn't like the experience after that post.  I'm not going to take any action against Warpd beyond replacing the sword as your post here designates yourself to be an asshole in the same league that you are complaining about in which case I can't fault Warpd for fucking you over... seeing this as a circumstance between one asshole and another whereby I have no jurisdiction. You could have petitioned a GM or asking any oneof my members who the leader was and contacted me to resolve this instead of coming here to besmirch a guild's rep over one instance of bad judgement by one of my guildmates.  In that regard... please accept my hearty fuck you and hope you don't ever require the services of one of my members.<br>
<br>
To the wizard from SoP, my sincerest apologies, if you let me know who you are (the dickhead above didn't bother to leave your name) I'll be happy to replace the piece of shit sword for you.<br>

If I were to do this I could trash nearly every guild on this server by the experiences I've had so far with the various members of all the guilds on this server.  There's good folks and bad folks in every guild as every member of every guild can attest to.  I suggest you get a few more experiences with the folks from a particular guild before trying to trash them on the boards.  And no, Warpd is giving himself a bad rep.  I don't condone his actions which is what you should have tried to find out before posting that tripe above.  You sent one tell to one member... great... I bet you thought that gave you clearance to come out and start raping my guild in the forums.  <br>
<br>
Guilds have officers and a guild leader.  We just live to fix shit like this while we're online.  Actually, I get off on it.  However, considering I've never seen your name in my tells nor anyone else from that camp relaying to me what had happened I feel that you and your groupmates have deprived me of the reason for my online EQ existance and that just pisses me off.  <br>
<br>
Here's what I use to judge guilds and their members by, you should try it yourself...<br>
an action by 3+ people of the same guild is a guild action.  Anything less is an individual(s) action.  Try that next time in your sorting of guild or individual rep determination.<br>

I was the wizard that won the Nathsar Crapsword last night. I have no ill will towards UDL. One member being a dick does not mean that the guild is full of dicks. As far as I'm concerned he acted alone and this shouldn't reflect on UDL. However, I would like to know if they are going to take any actions against him. I was in a guild where a member (an officer no less) ninja'd a mage robe in hate. We ended up removing that player from the guild because we would not tolerate that kind of behavior from anyone.<br>
<br>
I did petition after the incident and after reviewing all of my /reports, the sword was returned to me and Warpd was suspended. Apparently he's had other complaints against him in the past. I really couldn't care less about the sword, afterall, it is just crap. Its his refusing to hand it over that pissed me off.

I'll be sure to replace the sword regardless of it's worth.  It's an honor thing.<br>
<br>
As far as Warpd goes, I'm guessing this occured in the wee hours of the night.  He's been known to do some pretty strange stuff that late that usually makes us laugh and sometimes even scares us.  I don't consider this one laughable though.  If the GM's have suspended him then I see no reason for me to take further action beyond finding out what was going through his head when he did it and issue an apology and replace the item.  Warpd has some extenuating circumstances that causes him to do some pretty strange shit in the late hours with no recollection of it in the morning.  We've seen this a few times but this is the first case I've heard of him ninja'ing something while in that state.<br>
<br>
As far as booting him... he's been a valuable member and a good friend for close to two years now.  I'm not going to boot him from the guild over this one instance.  If everyone wants to condemn us because we're not going to toss a 2 year old friend and guildmate to the wolves over this one time then I have to say so be it and I don't really want to have anything further to do with the general populace of the server if this to be the case.  UDL is an 8 year old guild.  We're not just a guild... we're a family and we stick by each other.  If we were talking about a new recruit my foot would be well into his ass and he'd be out the door.  Anyway, as you say, the GM's have suspended him and that's a fair enough punishment.  Better than any that I could dream up for him.  I'll contact you in game.<br>

&quot;God forbid a Heiro Cloak or something valuable had dropped.&quot;<br>
<br>
It would have been replaced as well.  No sweat.<br>
