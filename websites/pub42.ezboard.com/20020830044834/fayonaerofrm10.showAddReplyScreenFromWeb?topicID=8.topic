finaly noticed that they were being watched and approached. It appeared that he would not have to wait much longer to speak with them...not much longer at all. However, for as much as he had been trying to speak with them, he dreaded it. Though he had a good understanding of Common in the time he had been away from home, it was physicly painfull for him to form the words. And this he did not looke forward to. But try he must. He needed allies in this land.<br>
<br>
Quitely he watched as the one he had learned was named Vanlaan aproached. He sat down next to him and said nothing at first. They both sat in silence, eyeing each other up. Then finaly Vanlaan spoke. <br>
&quot;Can I buy you a drink?&quot;. The question was completely unexpected. Drakhnar chuckled slightly and the question that followed was more the one he expected. &quot;I noticed you watching my companion and I as we came in. Is there something I can help you with?&quot; Vanlaan said. Drahnar thought for a second, he had to choose his words carefully. Finaly he spoke in a tone he hoped was low enough that the others in the Inn would not hear. &quot;Yesss, I have been following for sssome time. I have been wanting to sssspeak with you. Firssst I want you to know that I mean you and your friend no harm. I sssimply asssk that you hear me out. Asss for the drink, I would like another yesss.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Vanlaan looked up and caught Aedare's eye.  As long as Casidy was out serving the patrons, he figured she had a few moments she could spare from her &quot;game.&quot;  He sighed inwardly.  Innoruuk had found a vessel with a great deal of rage, in Aedare, but Vanlaan sometimes wondered if she would ever learn to channel it properly.  Time would tell.  He motioned Aedare over to the table.  &quot;Fetch a couple more ales.&quot;  As she left the table to run his errand, he watched the Iksar.  Kunark was still recently discovered and he hadn't had the opportunity to meet any of the Iksar yet.  When Aedare returned with the ale, he motioned her close.  &quot;Please don't cause any trouble.  I know you find this amusing, but we mustn't attract too much attention.  Have your fun, but don't let it get out of hand.  Understand?&quot;  Aedare nodded, although he could tell she wasn't all that happy with his reprimand.  With a defiant look, she headed back towards the bard.<br>
<br>
Shaking his head, he turned back to the Iksar.  &quot;Have another drink,&quot; he said, as he pushed the tankard across the table.  &quot;Let me introduce myself.  I am Vanlaan, Third Circle Necromancer of the Church of the Firstborn and my traveling companion is Aedare, Shadow Knight of Innoruuk, Novice to the Church of the Firstborn.  We are currently traveling the vast lands of Norrath, since we are not overly welcome in Neriak at this time.   You find yourself a fair distance from... Cabilis, isn't it?  What brings you to this part of Norrath?&quot;  Vanlaan looked over at Aedare again.  She was currently spinning another tale.  This one would probably not be as well received as her first.  Some tales just didn't translate well.  He turned back to the Iksar and waited for him to speak. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/udahrkon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dahrkon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/5/01 11:14:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RE: Story continued...</span><hr size=1> Everyone, had stop to listen to the bards tale.  Personally, Drakhnar didn't care much for song but the others seemed to like it.  This was good, because it kept their attention on her and not on him and the less people noticed him, the better.  He had learned one thing in his time here.  Iksar were not well liked.  <br>
<br>
Now came time for the female &quot;dark one&quot; to tell her tale.  There was no song or elaborate wording.  Only the story itself.  This was a good story, though the others in the inn didn't seem to see the humor in it.  Still, it did cause a small chuckle to rise out of him.  <br>
<br>
Vanlaan had motioned for his female companion to approach.  He said something to her but Drakhnar could not understand what.  Though it became clear to him a few minutes later when she returned with their drinks.  His fresh one was slid across the table to him and he nodded his head in appreciation.  He had recently learned not to try to smile, as the &quot;soft skins&quot; called it.  It seemed to have an effect opposite of that which was intended.  No matter, it was not exactly a comfortable custom.  <br>
<br>
Vanlaan once more turned back to Drakhnar and addressed him.  &quot;Let me introduce myself. I am Vanlaan, Third Circle Necromancer of the Church of the Firstborn and my traveling companion is Aedare, Shadow Knight of Innoruuk, Novice to the Church of the Firstborn. We are currently traveling the vast lands of Norrath, since we are not overly welcome in Neriak at this time. You find yourself a fair distance from... Cabilis, isn't it? What brings you to this part of Norrath?&quot;  Drakhnar knew of Innoruuk.  Though his god was not the same, as he had origninally hoped, he still hoped that the similarity between the God of Hate and the God of Fear would be enough to aid in forming a friendship with these two as friends was something he needed desprately right now.  Drakhnar responded, &quot;My name isss Drakhnar, alssso a third sssircle necromanssser like yourssself.  Yesss, Cabilisss isss very far from here.  Though like yourssself I find myssself traveling.  I ssseek knowledge.  Asss much asss there isss to learn in Cabilisss, I ssseek more.  It isss not limited in ssscope, but rather bredth of what I can learn there....and I ssseek more.  However I find myssself ssspending more time hiding from thossse who hunt my kind than I do learning.

I seem to have gotten lost in the past.  Your desire to learn brings back memories.&quot;  He sat for a moment, and then nodded to himself as if having made a decision.  He took a drink, as if to fortify himself, and then continued.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm afraid I may not be as much help as you might have hoped.  You see, over 20 years ago I met up with a member of the Dismal Rage who said she had known my sister.  My sister was captured and executed by the Paladins of Freeport.  It was my duty to recover her bones so that she could continue to serve Innoruuk.  Aedare, the member of the Dismal Rage, was able to help me accomplish this.  Once I had fulfilled my obligations to my sister and Innoruuk, I felt I could return to my role of scholar.  Innoruuk had other plans for me and He was not to be thwarted.  Several years ago I learned that Aedare was dying, after having been captured and tortured by the Paladins for her role as Priestess of the Dismal Rage.  Innoruuk was not through with Aedare... in fact, He has plans for her, although I am hardly privy to what those might be.  I just know that He came to me and bade me rescue Aedare.  So I did.  During my years of reserach, I had learned of a spell that would enable me to turn her into a Dark Elf.  You see, she was a human.  So, I did.&quot;  Vanlaan shuddered.  &quot;It was an unpleasant experience, especially for Aedare.  But she survived.  Unfortunately, the Spires, which is currently in control of Neriak, did not believe me when I told them that my actions had been directed by Innoruuk Himself.  They did not believe that I, a Third Circle Necromancer could possibly know anything about the whims of Innoruuk.  But then, who truly knows the whims of any God?  Anyway, Aedare, the Dark Elf I came in with, and I are spurned.  Which means, although I truly wish to assist a fellow scholar, I'm not sure how much help I can be.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vanlaan sat back and closed his eyes.  Without opening his eyes he said, &quot;Grand adventure was never what I was looking for.  I simply wanted to be a teacher.  It would appear that He has more in mind for me.&quot;  He opened his eyes and looked at Drakhnar.  &quot;I will help you any way I can.  I do have some texts with me that pertain to the Church of the Firstborn.  They are my most treasured possession, but I will let you borrow them [<a href="http://firstborn.eqhq.com" target="new">Church of the Firstborn Texts</a>] to learn what you may.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vanlaan leaned forward and looked intently at the Iksar.  &quot;I do not believe in Fate.  There is no Fate for Dark Elves, only Innoruuk.  He has brought you here for a reason.  I do not know what it is, but I intend to find out.  Until then, you are more then welcome to travel with Aedare and I.  I still have a few contacts at the Church.  I will try and get a message to them.  Until then, we will wait and see what He has in mind for us.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vanlaan sat back again and looked around the Inn.  That was odd... he didn't see Aedare.  She didn't often tire of her games so quickly.  Ah well, she was probably just outside working her frustrations out on some haplass orc pawn that just happened to get in her way. <p><b>Vanlaan</b>

And though he understood what Vanlaan was saying, he still thought he had much he could learn from this fellow necromancer.  He thought to himself for a minute, then decided.  &quot;Yesss, I will come with you.  Though you may keep your ssschrollss.  I think I will learn more from you then from any piessse of paper.&quot;  You see, Iksar do not do things because they &quot;want&quot; to.  They do not do things because of little whims or emotions.  They do things simply as a means to an end.  And in this man he saw a wealth of knowledge beyond any contained in a few scrolls.  Drakhnar continued, &quot;you sssay all you want isss to teach.  Then teach me what you know.  I will come with you and add to your group my own power and ssstrengthsss.  And with that, repay you by helping you complete your goalsss in whatever whysss I can, for I have little elssse to give.&quot;  And with that he quaffed the last of his drink which was promptly followed by a toothy reptillian grin.  He then remembered how ill-accepted his people are, let alone the appearance of one of their &quot;smiles&quot; and began to scan the tavern to see if anyone noticed him.  It appeared they were all too busy drinking and laughing, which was good.  <br>
<br>
As Drakhnar finished surveying the room, he began to notice that something was missing.  Something, or some one was missing.  Damn these &quot;soft skins&quot;, they all looked alike to his eyes.  The only way he could really tell them appart was their smell and right now the room was so filled with their scent and the scent of the local spirits that that it almost made him dizzy when he tried to separate them out.  Then he realized what it was that was missing.  He turned to his companion at the table and spoke.  &quot;Sssir, Vanlaan, your traveling companion appearsss to have traveled on without you, usss.&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/udahrkon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dahrkon</A> at: 1/9/01 8:30:04 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10>Roleplaying & GM Events</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
