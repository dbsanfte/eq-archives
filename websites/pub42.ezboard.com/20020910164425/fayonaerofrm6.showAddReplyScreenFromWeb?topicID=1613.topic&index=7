I suppose I deserve a chance to defend myself /shrug.<br>
<br>
First of all, I have yet to meet anyone in Lower Guk that actually likes you!! I've met several people down there, and have bent over backwards for complete stranger's (ie. Verkice who I met only a few days ago ((your beef is with me, talk shit about me, dont drag others into this non-sense and bafoonery, but if you insist on doing that, then by all means do it, after all its a god-given right which I swore to defend with my life as a former U.S. Marine, freedom of speech that is)))<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I am a level 54 necro, and I still hunt in Lower Guk, due to it's exp bonus, many are light blue and dark blue, but Around the frenzy to lord area, is great exp.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
True.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; On one of my many adventures, I ran into a Shadow Knight named Zigee, a member of Angels of Fate, and a druid, named, Lokey, also in Angels of Fate, and their side kick, Verkice, of Mark of Honor. Now I try to be a pretty fair person when it comes to camps.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
True again, I'll even give you the benefit of the doubt on wether or not your a fair person when it comes to camps.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Onto the situation. As a solo necro, Sometimes things can get pretty bad in a solo situation, there are a few wandering mobs around the frenzy area's pull room.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
Once again, true.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;So here I am, I got a bunch of adds, so I FD, LoM and Low on Hit Points. So they come running in, and are like, &quot;Are you camping Frenzy?&quot; (It just so happens Frenzy pops at this instant, hmm druid?) &lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
STOP THE PRESS. We came running in?? This is where the thread takes a turn for what I like to call &quot;Fib-land&quot;. When I logged into lower guk that day I proceeded strait to the frenzy camp. When I arrived there I saw YOUR fresh corpse, and full pops (one of which was the frenzy himself!) so I do a /who Tza (turns out your in the bazaar) Now I havent been playing as long as some of you veterano's out there, but would'nt you call that an open camp? At this point myself and Lokey are medding getting ready to clear the outside area, when all of the sudden this cleric pops in, when it looked like he was about to take off, I say &quot;hey bro wait up! Tzaria here needs a rez&quot;, about the same time I'm hitting enter, your appearing over your corpse, so I guess you had that covered. Fine and dandy. Now your sitting down medding cause of the rez effects, and I'm thinking to myself, &quot;what the hell is she doing?&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Yes, I just got into trouble, Will be back up in a second&quot; &quot;Ok we're gonna pull frenzy&quot;  &quot;No please don't I am camping, I just got a bunch of adds, how about I invite you to my group and if he drops an FBSS we roll on it&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
False, NONE of this text ever occured, why would insert false text? Because if you didnt, you would be defeating the purpose of your own thread, which is to debunk me and give me a bad rep. (btw, why did you insert my guild's name into the subject of this thread, you got shit with me, then call ME out, /ponders damnit! I shoulda gone /anon before I go &quot;KS'ing&quot; or &quot;training&quot; you, kinda like you did right before you trained me in the safe hall, and between you and me, you know mother-fucking well I have never trained you, that shit is NOT my style, and to be honest Tz, I was suprised when you did that shit to me, I thought even you were above shit like that, you know damn well what I'm talking about, others dont, but between you and me, we know damn well.<br>
&gt;&gt;/invite Zigee<br>
/invite Lokey<br>
/invite Verkice&lt;&lt;<br>
True! but only AFTER you were getting your ass handed to you by frenzy and crew, lol, you expect me to help you then? Where were the invites before the pull?? NO-FUCKING-WHERE.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Now I stand up and pull the frenzy, I still am LoM and HP, so I cast BoD and a undead slow. When, suddenly they all disband! Now, they continue to kill frenzy, and they loot. I'm like &quot;wtf? What did he drop?&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
See, the story is totally garbled at this point, you didnt stand up to pull frenzy at this point, you were already engaged with them (and its about this time that Verkice shows up thinking he's gonna camp the frenzy with me, just to find this &quot;situation&quot;), while we had our own situation in the hall just before the frenzy room, now OUR situation gets worst because of the adds we got after you FD'd!! But no matter we handled ours (kinda like I handled you in that duel /laugh) Did he drop the sash? yes. Am I gonna give it to you? FUCK NO, why should I? BTW, why would we have supposedly &quot;disbanded&quot; if we wanted majority of the kill?? That alone show's your story is potentially full of holes.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Nothing, but everyone in my group has an FBSS now so the camp is all yours&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
True, we did all have sash's at this point.. enjoy the camp which you can only handle once broken.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;they have trained me on multiple occasions to get me out of a camp,&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
Tz, seriously, between you and me.....c'mon now, you know deep down inside your heart, that is a malicious lie, and I cant beleive you would stoop so low... There's only been ONE train occurence between you and me, and that was when YOU trained ME in the safehall. And when I asked you why the hell you would FD right there just down the hall from me with 6 mobs on you, what did you say?? :shakes head in sheer disgust.<br>
<br>
Well Tz, people can beleive either side's of this story, or they can make up their own mind about what kind of people you and I are, should they decide to ever have interaction with us. Hell you know, for all I know, your a nice/kind/decent person, maybe you were having a bad day that day, maybe I was having a bad day, whatever the reason for this silly bitterness between us, how about this, lets play the damn game, and next time I see you, expect a /wave and a /hug Ahhh hell, after all it's just a game... =)<br>
