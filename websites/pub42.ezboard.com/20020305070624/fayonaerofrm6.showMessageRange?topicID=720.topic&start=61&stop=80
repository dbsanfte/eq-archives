You understand that when asked, Orontes left?  You also understand that Yeogou is level 60 also?  You understand that Asterisko is killing green mobs too?  This isn't about us stomping over noobs or stealing XP camps.  Nothing got stolen, for god's sake.<br>
<br>
Nobody KS'd anyone.  (With the possible exception of Yeugou attempting to KS Orontes by jumping in on mobs he was casting on.)  Every mob Orontes STARTED cast on was standing alone and unengaged.<br>
<br>
Orontes does state he dislikes high-level farmers killing greens.  What Yeugou leaves out is Orontes describing himself as an object of his dislike as well.  Verant makes tradeskill players farm greens.  I hate it.  Orontes hates it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Remember the sequence of events:<br>

95% of what you see here occured while Orontes was roaming the zone, attacking wandering grimlings -- those outside the caves.<br>

<br>
In the time it took me to run from the bank in Grimling to the caves in Tenebrous (an adjacent zone), Orontes had already left.  That's it.  That's the end of their encounter.<br>
<br>
Also, ask yourself this:  Why is Yeugou taking screenshots of EVERYTHING?  He starts taking screenshots before he's even talked to me.  He takes a screenshot of going /who all vision and asking Burnine for my name.  Does he need proof that Burnine isn't going to lie to him?  What the hell is this all about?<br>
<br>
Yeugou started with the camp.  Yougou left with the camp.  What in the hell is he complaining about?  He's bitching here because we don't AGREE with him.  He got everything he wanted except for us to see eye to eye.  I see his point.  I simply disagree.  Nonetheless, we STILL backed off and gave him what he wanted.  What more do you want?<br>
<br>
I, for one, pray those camps stop dropping gems so that people who want to work tradeskills can actually get what they need without dealing with the greedy people on the server. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4868>Palimax Sceleris</a>,

I'm not talking about honest mistakes (since you can't necessarily tell what mob someone is casting on).  I'm talking about what Yuego admitted doing -- intentionally engaging a mob that he knew someone else was casting on.<br>
<br>
Yuego argues that even if someone has obviously begun casting a mob, if you can gain aggro before the spell lands, then you have a right to the mob and the caster is KSing.  This obviously is a very melee centric point of view.<br>
<br>
Straight from the horse's (Verant's) mouth: <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Kill Stealing is defined as the killing of an NPC for any reason that is already fighting or pursuing another player or group without that group's specific permission.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Verant's definition is ambiguous in this regard.  If a wizard begins casting on a mob then arguably the wizard and the NPC are &quot;already fighting.&quot;  If an enchanter mezzes a mob and that mob's hate list is cleared by the mez (small chance but it happens especially at lower levels), does the enchanter have claim to the mob?  No one is on the aggro list in either case but arguably the PC and the NPC are &quot;already fighting.&quot;  The intent is there, it's just a longer time between the act and the result (much like there's a short pause between turning on autoattack and actually attacking).<br>
<br>
As a side note here, players have modified this definition by requiring that the player or group fighting or being pursued be capable of killing the mob (e.g. Lodizal).<br>
<br>
I'm not sure Verant would side with Yuego in this situation.  If he intentionally goes around and engages mobs that a player has already begun casting (as he stated he did in his post), I believe his action would violate Verant's policy (particularly if you invoke the general 'harassment' policy).<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, because this point is ambiguous there's arguments on Yuego's side as well.  However, I still think if I followed someone around and attacked everything he (or she) started casting on, Verant would view that as kill stealing and likely harassment. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/upalimaxsceleris.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Palimax Sceleris</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/19/01 9:27:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=720.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Palimax gives back to the community!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The interesting point as raised initially by Palimax and disputed by Yuego is whether it is KS to intentionally engage a mob that someone has already begun casting on. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I tried to steer away from that.  Frankly, we can play semantics about the situation all day long.  KS'ing someone comes in a lot of debatable flavors.<br>

<br>
Yeugou claims, &quot;I used /say TWICE and you [Orontes] responded with a flippant remark that meant you would keep killing as you saw fit. I then took it to /ooc and guess what, the others in the zone chimed in and I realized you hadnt done this just in the mine I was in, you did it in the other one first.&quot; So no, he didn't leave immediately upon being asked the first time. <br>
<br>
In any event, the situation should never have happened. Orontes should have done a camp check, or asked the people sitting there if they were camping these mobs. He even *said* he walked right over Yeugou who was sitting right there. What, honestly, did he think Yeugou was doing sitting there if not camping the mobs that were right there?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> You also understand that Yeogou is level 60 also? You understand that Asterisko is killing green mobs too?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Yeugou said in a prior post that the other group (Asterisco's) was getting exp.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> This isn't about us stomping over noobs or stealing XP camps.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
There's a difference between taking over xp camps and taking over loot camps? <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I, for one, pray those camps stop dropping gems so that people who want to work tradeskills can actually get what they need without dealing with the greedy people on the server.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
So farming one type of phat lewt (gems) is &quot;greedy,&quot; but farming another type of phat lewt (tradeskill stuff) isn't? You and Orontes are just as &quot;greedy&quot; as Yeugou or anyone else who farms greens (if you want to call farming greens &quot;greedy&quot;). <br>
<br>
But &quot;greedy&quot; or not, Orontes had no right to walk right past Yeugou and blow up the mobs he was obviously camping without asking.<br>
<br>
And I notice you are using the word &quot;camps&quot; to describe those mines now. I thought your position was that there's no such thing as a camp...? <p>__________<br>

<br>
By &quot;obviously camping&quot; you mean &quot;sitting near,&quot; right?  Because when someone's obviously camping something they don't have a bunch of them standing around unengaged.<br>
<br>
I have a small tip.  If I'm camping green mobs my pet can solo, you'll be able to tell by the absense of green mobs - as they'll be dead.  ...and if they're not all dead, I clearly can't handle them all, and would be foolish to lay claim to them all.<br>
<br>
Yeugou wasn't &quot;obviously camping&quot; ANYTHING.  If he was &quot;obviously camping&quot; it, he would have been doing something more than sitting on his ass flapping his gums at a one of the LEAST efficient classes at killing mid-greens en masse.<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, to avoid incident, ORONTES LEFT - despite any evidence that Yeugou planned on doing anything other than (a) standing around and watching stuff stand around unkilled at it's bind point, and (b) trying to intercept mobs that Orontes cast on.<br>
<br>
...and with regard to Vision's policy about camps.  Yes.  We agree there are camps.  We don't agree that you can sit, for example, in a bunch of mobs that you aren't killing and announce, &quot;I claim these mobs in the name of Spain!&quot;  Please, go to Cobalt Scar and pull a mob from near the port-circle.  Then, announce that since, eventually, you'll have time to kill ALL of the mobs by the circle, nobody else can pull mobs from your camp.  Attempt this same thing in Dreadlands on the ridge.  GODDAMNIT, I SAID THE RIDGE WAS CAMPED!!!!@#<br>
<br>
The cool part of all of this is that, even in light of all of this, ORONTES STILL LEFT.<br>
<br>
He killed a grimling -- one Yeugou, apparently, was going to get around to killing sometime in the year 2037 -- and then, when given grief about doing so...  ...he LEFT.<br>
<br>
Do you know why we left?  Because no matter how stupid Yeugou is, no matter how soon he started taking screenshots to come running here like a girl with a skinned knee who fell of her skateboard, we STILL tried to do the right thing and leave him the hell alone.<br>

Nydia: "I have a question then: Yuegou, in ONE paragraph, what would you have *liked* to have happened? Would *any* of the actual or possible remedies have resolved the issue to your satisfacton? If not, then what is the actual nature of the problem?"<br>
<br>
Hehe funny how someone gets to the heart of the matter in a simple straightforward way. Thanks Nydia, here is my ONE paragraph to you :)<br>
<br>
I would have liked Palimax and Orontes to simply have acknowledged that courtesy is something that all players deserve no matter if the mob is red, green or uber and that Orontes did not extend any courtesy in this situation. I would like to know that in the future they will respect others camps no matter what mob is being camped.<br>
<br>
There ya go Nydia :)<br>
<br>
------<br>
<br>
Palimax:<br>
<br>
"You understand that when asked, Orontes left?"<br>
<br>
When asked by whom? Certainly not me, he continued after I informed him I was camping the area. Perhaps you mean the first mine?<br>
<br>
"You understand that Asterisko is killing green mobs too?"<br>
<br>
There was a 39th level enchanter getting xps in Asterisco's group. He was getting xps. That nullified your position of it was ok for Orontes to do what he did because 60ths were farming greens.<br>
<br>
"This isn't about us stomping over noobs or stealing XP camps. Nothing got stolen, for god's sake."<br>
<br>
You imply that since there were no newbies or xp camps involved, pushing your way into established camps is ok? I just want to make sure that is what you mean.<br>
<br>
You are correct, nothing was "stolen" since we never owned anything in the first place. If someone rushed Ragefire after you spawned him and killed him, nothing was stolen since no one owns mobs. While its 100% true according to Verants rules, we as players live by rules we set for ourselves. Those rules are based on things like courtesy. The lack of courtesy is what I and the others were ticked off about. You keep pointing out the loot, the mobs, and the camps, but you refuse to mention one thing about the lack of courtesy in the situation... why is that Palimax?<br>
<br>
"Nobody KS'd anyone. (With the possible exception of Yeugou attempting to KS Orontes by jumping in on mobs he was casting on.) Every mob Orontes STARTED cast on was standing alone and unengaged."<br>
<br>
Hold up there Palimax. You and Orontes decided it was ok to kill any mob you chose because of Verants rules stating no one owns mobs. If you are going to stand by Verants rules, then stand by all of them. Dont start adding your extra guidelines to them. Verants rules state flat out that mobs have to be agro on a person to "belong" to that person. Orontes was casting on mobs that were not agro on him. They would not be agro until his spell hit them, and you stated his spells killed them in one shot... so how could the mobs be agro on him? The mobs were agro and meleeing me when his spells landed. If you want to be technical pricks and say no one owns mobs, I can fight fire with fire and point out you were KSing according to Verants rules. Started casting on doesnt mean jack shit... I run for mobs all the time and lose them... does that mean since I started moving towards them that they are mine now? Am I supposed to use the assist command now to see if a caster has a mob targeted before I engage it? How was I supposed to know he wasnt gating out or buffing? Yeah I thought so.<br>
<br>
"What Yeugou leaves out is Orontes describing himself as an object of his dislike as well. Verant makes tradeskill players farm greens. I hate it. Orontes hates it.<br>
<br>
I didnt leave that out, I mentioned it several times including it being in the screenshots... where did you come up with me leaving it out?<br>
<br>
Since he hates himself its ok to push into camps then?<br>
<br>
"Orontes encounters an unengaged mob and kills it.<br>
Yeugou complains.<br>
Orontes leaves.<br>
~THEN~ The situation is discussed in OOC.<br>
Yeugou still not happy, brings the topic here."<br>
<br>
Wrong again. It was going on in the ooc while he was still there. As for me bringing it here, I can post the screenshots of you saying twice it would be ok to post it here, and once of Orontes saying the same thing... now you are changing your minds?<br>
<br>
"ORONTES LEFT THE GODDAMNED CAVES ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. GET THAT THROUGH YOUR THICK SKULLS."<br>
<br>
And that means it was ok? Lets say we forget this ever happened... do you still believe in the future that its ok if he walks into those mines and start nuking whatever mobs he wants when there are people(s) already in there camping those mobs? What you need to get thru YOUR thick skull is I am not argueing about his actions, I am argueing about his lack of courtesy towards others in the game. There must be courtesy in these situations or you get what we had that day. Once again you are dodging the courtesy point.<br>
<br>
"Why is Yeugou taking screenshots of EVERYTHING? He starts taking screenshots before he's even talked to me."<br>
<br>
Why? To prove you are lying out your ass when the situation arises. I have already caught both you and Orontes in lies by having the screenshots. People like to say where are the logs or the screenshots around here... well I got them this time and now you are pissed? Hahahaha too funny. I actually started taking the screenshots after you stated you didnt care, its very easy to scroll back and screenshot.<br>
<br>
"Does he need proof that Burnine isn't going to lie to him? What the hell is this all about?"<br>
<br>
I was taking screenshots of the arguement that was going on in ooc mostly between Orontes and the others in the zone... does that bother you for some reason? Why would Burnine lie to me? Why would you imply that? Does it hurt your ego to know that I didnt know offhand that you were the one that had some sway over Orontes actions? Im sorry I dont memorize the leaders of every guild, Ill try and make a point of it next time so you dont get bruised.<br>
<br>
"He got everything he wanted except for us to see eye to eye. I see his point. I simply disagree. Nonetheless, we STILL backed off and gave him what he wanted. What more do you want?"<br>
<br>
What do I want? I want you and yours to extend courtesy to everyone else. People dont barge in on your camps, dont do it to them. Saying you didnt know we were camping them is no crutch to lean on since he could have shouted a camp check, or even stopped at me and the others and asked what are we camping. You say you see my point, but that doesnt mean this shit isnt gonna happen again in the future.<br>
<br>
"I, for one, pray those camps stop dropping gems so that people who want to work tradeskills can actually get what they need without dealing with the greedy people on the server."<br>
<br>
Huh? First of all, none of us where there for the gems. One or two were there for the xps, the others were there for the same reason as Orontes. The Ore. I had no idea any of the loot had any value to it until the next day when one of the others in the zone told me that two of the gems sold for 75 and 100pp. Even knowing that, I still didnt loot them, I let others loot them as I was there solely for the small pieces of acrylia. When I got my 94 pieces, I left. I havent been back since, tho I am still in the zone for other reasons now. Implying that I was there for the gems or that those gems are what led to this problem is lame, I can get coin much faster from farming frogs or guards in guk or neriak or even the huge grimling camps in hollowshade.<br>
<br>
"The situation was stupid, I asked Orontes to leave, he left."<br>
<br>
Is that what people complained about? No, they complained about your statements saying courtesy didnt need to be applied since no one owned mobs according to verant. Until you acknowledge that courtesy must be applied, the problem will still exist. Up to this point and most likely hereafter, I would never have barged in on a camp of yours, yet you seem to think you have the right to do it to me. That is the problem.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
XodaPara: "Where did you buy that lvl 60 char? 13s castingtime? On a green mob? Do wuzzards even GET a 13s casting time spell? 6-7.5 are the HUGE nukes in my experience  the 1200, 1875(?) and 2k."<br>
<br>
What does me being level 60 have to do with a wizards casting time? Your reasoning is amazingly stupid. I know almost nil about a wizard, so I looked up the spell he claimed he was using "Ice Spear of the Soloist" on EQCasters. It listed the casting time as 13 seconds and it seemed right since he did take a long time to cast each spell. So unless the casting time is shorter and EQCasters is wrong, please shut your fucking mouth and stop implying I bought my character from Ebay. I have been around since beta and if you care to dispute that, feel free to contact Verant and inform them of your wrong opinions on the matter.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
Jexmann: "you should have stuck to the topic rather than sling personal insults"<br>
<br>
Actually I did stick to the topic, you decided to deviate from the topic in your 2nd post and compared me to a child. Until you decided to start slinging insults, I had no problem with you. Dont waggle your finger in my direction when you have only yourself to blame. Its ok tho, since I showed you to be wrong, your only recourse was for the insults, I understand, keep up the good work.<br>
<br>
----- <br>
<br>
And finally back to Grimveld. A small suggestion, dont bother. You would have more luck talking to a wall. These guys will never see the point of the people that dont agree with them. I just like to argue, so I continue. I am 100% self sufficient in the game so their threats make no difference to my posting style. I would feel better if ya didnt get yourself into trouble with these tards if you dont have to, since you never know when you may need their assistance. If however you do get into a bind and one of these pricks refuses to help you out because of agreeing with me, feel free to contact myself or any of my guildmates for the help you need. Thanks. <p><img src="http://members.home.net/moonie1/images/YIEsig.jpg" usemap="#YIEsig.jpg" border="0">

<br>
As I read it this is what palimax actually said...correct me if I'm wrong.<br>
<br>
A camp that he would respect would be empty, as in you killed all the mobs &amp; are waiting for the next one to pop.  If your camp is full of mobs then you can't handle them all &amp; can afford to share.<br>
<br>
Personally I think this makes sense...I needed to kill kunark goblins the other week for faction &amp; went to the goblin fort in WW.  About half the goblins were dead &amp; the killer was nowhere to be found.  So I killed a few &amp; finally found thier killer medding.  Since he couldn't kill all the goblins before they started repopping it was no problem &amp; we shared.  When he left I took over the area &amp; got all the mobs popping in sequence so there was only one up at a time and I was constantly killing goblins.  If someone had wanted to enter the camp they would have nothing to kill.  THAT is camped.  If multiple mobs are up, you aren't killing em...unless this is a special camp where everything pops at the same time...that is not camped IMHO.<br>
<br>
Regardless, he left, who cares?<br>

You got courtesy Yeugou.  When confronted about your &quot;camp&quot;; when presented with you saying that you were camping them, Orontes left.  He had a large number of options available to him.  He chose the one that afforded you the most courtesy - he left you alone.  We've already demonstrated we respect people's camps, by leaving them alone when asked.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Orontes did not extend any courtesy in this situation.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Orontes killed mobs in the Grimling caves because you wern't killing anything when he showed up.  You were either unable to kill everything, or not active in doing so.  You keep trying to paint this like Orontes came into the zone, saw you killing mobs and then started nuking on your mobs to take them away from you.  HE KILLED A MOB THAT YOU WERN'T KILLING, AND WERN'T TRYING TO KILL.<br>
<br>
There's nothing to spin.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Orontes did not extend any courtesy in this situation.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Orontes left the CAVES and remained in the zone for a while.  I've been pretty clear about that.  When I say Orontes left, I mean he left the caves.  Everytime that anyone says anything that isn't 100% with what you IMAGINE it means you start shouting LAIR! at the top of your lungs.  I made the mistake of thinking Asterisco was in your guild...  LIAR!   I say Orontes left, and you think I mean he ported away...  LAIR!  For god's sake, I haven't come to this board and told lies before; why would I start doing so now?<br>
<br>

Vision honored your camp.<br>
<br>
Let me say that again, with greater illustration this time, cause you're obviously too dense to get ANYTHING the first time.<br>
<br>
You didn't appear to be killing mobs in the Grimling caves in Tenebrous mountains -- evidenced by the fact that they were just standing there, at full heath, not attacking anything, so Orontes started killing them; then you complained, at which point Orontes went to a different part of the zone and discussed the issue in /ooc.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Orontes did not extend any courtesy in this situation.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Once you made claim to your camp, Orontes left.  Vision honored your camp.<br>
<br>
What great inconvenience did Orontes cause you?  What terrible lie are we perpetuating?  For the love of god, what did we do to you more than leave you alone when you asked us to?<br>
<br>
It's nearly comical.  You got your way, and then you came here to complain that you got your way.  We can't do anything more than comply with ALL of your requests.<br>
<br>
Pur your tin-foil hat back on and stay clear of the mind control lasers; they're obviously causing you to have some trouble with reality.<br>
<br>
...and let me drop the guildleader facade for a minute and say something on a personal level:<br>
<br>
QUIT WHINING THAT YOU DIDN'T GET YOUR WAY.  YOU GOT YOUR WAY AND YOU'RE STILL CRYING LIKE MY ONE-YEAR OLD.  THERE WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH KLEENEX IN THE WORLD FOR THE TEARS YOU'D HAVE IF ORONTES STAYED AT YOUR OH-SO-PRECIOUS GRIMLING GOLDMINE.<br>
<br>
Yeugou, in the future, please find another Vision officer to escalate your issues to, as you'll be the SECOND person in all of Everquest to join my permanant /ignore list.  Please direct your in-game requests to a more friendly officer... ...like Orontes. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4868>Palimax Sceleris</a>,

<br>
I agree.<br>
<br>
I'd also wager if Orontes was a level 50 Wizard in some no-name guild, as opposed to a 60 Wizard and a Vision officer, this thread would have never been started.<br>
<br>
The rebellious Gladiator-esque RAEG AGAINST TEH MACHIEN FUCK THE SYSTEM act really, really got old.  No, Vision isn't some sort of corrupted, evil guild, in which you need to inform the public of the 'real truth'.<br>
<br>
This is about farming greens.  Period.  What I see from this thread, Orontes walked into a green zone, sees another level 60 whacking greens, begins to kill and Yuegou's temper shot out through his mouth.  So, in turn, Orontes wasn't as courteous as to his demands.  Did you take screenshots of you first mentioning to Orontes that you were 'camping' that area?  I'll bet it wasn't filled with sunshine smiley faces, judging on previous .. disagreements I've seen concerning you and another player.<br>
<br>
Palimax, you're a pretty well-respected guildleader.  And, Yuegou, well, you have .. quite a mouth, but, I think you generally have your head on straight and you can be an okay guy.  I think you both really need to agree to disagree, and stop posting to such a damned pointless argument.  I'm sure neither parties intended to be malicious KSing assholes, and regardless, he left anyway. <p><table>

<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Why? To prove you are lying out your ass when the situation arises. I have already caught both you and Orontes in lies by having the screenshots&quot;<br>
<br>
I would like you to go back and look at those shots again...not one shows any shred of evidence of Palimax or I lieing...all they show is me involved in an argument with SOMEONE OTHER THAN YOU!  look carefully, and then from you massive collection of screen shots, show me ONE that demonstrates you talking to me first...you've claimed to have the whole film in the can, this shouldn't be too hard to come up with.  Show me ONE screenshot that shows YOU arguing with ME before talking to my guildleader- I'm sure you have them.  <br>
<br>
I started by going to Yugo's OWN link that allegedly proves he was chatting with me before I killed stuff- have a look, it seems to be me /oocing, with no input or output from Yugo in sight.  (sorry still figuring out this EZboard stuff, go to his post for the link that says &quot;Here&quot;)<br>
<br>
Then, he takes a screenshot of me arguing with someone else (Asterisco, who seems much more grown up and whom I was able to talk with) and claims it verifies HIS arguments- try again.  Post the screenshot that shows YOU saying something to me, followed by a response- you MUST have them if you recorded as muxh as you claim.<br>
<br>
You have accused me of lieing multiple times, but in the course of your posts, it is easy to detect contradictions and inconsistencies on your part aas well- I'll make you a deal, a stack of ore for every outright falsehood of yours I can back up with another of your own posts.  <br>
<br>
&quot;When I have been discourteous before this incident to you or any Vision member&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;You are blatantly lying like Palimax did to distort the truth&quot; <br>
<br>
Seriously, Yugo, show ONE screenshot that contains your &quot;blatant lie&quot;- not your half baked conjectures or out of context single quotes- show some proof, in context...<br>
<br>
&quot;You fuckin hypocrite&quot;<br>
&quot;That made you a bigger piece of shit&quot;<br>
&quot;your lying again Orontes&quot;<br>
<br>
I guess mebbe you're right since this was the first time we ever met, you were never discourteous before.  You certainly are now...and since 100% of the time I've know you, you have been a foul mouthed, misleading hypocritical troll, I guess I will have to go with the assumption that nothing has changed from the past.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, I BEG you to find a screenshot of me every using language like this...in or out of the game...courtesy indeed my friend, courtesy indeed...<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;And for the record, you did not see 6 grimlings standing up, because you only engaged 4 max. The two before the room, and the first two in the room&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Quick note, they are social, you would know that if you werent ganking them as they spawned&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, I just have to say for the record, I guess I need a new monitor, or glasses, because I saw 6 mobs, all spawned and standing about- and there were no corpses.  And if they're social, well I guess I never noticed because they never help each other even at full spawn.  Funny way of being &quot;social&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, basically, back up your opinions with facts as opposed to theories and misleading screenshots...and if this entire thread is about 'courtesy&quot; then by all means, SHOW SOME.<br>
<br>
Orontes<br>
Sorcerer<br>

Here's my log for the event (minus guildchat and some tells about tinkering...)  I'll be the first to admit, having seen the entire situation unfold on Orontes' monitor, and having already given up the mobs to Yeugou, I have little patience for him.  If you skip any long post, I suggest you skip this one.  It's a rehash of what I've been shouting for the last couple of days.<br>
<br>
Please take special note of the following times:<br>
16:37:00 - Yeugou sends me a tell about Orontes.<br>
16:41:42 - I show up in Tenebrous.<br>
16:42:04 - OOC shows Orontes has already left.<br>
16:48:03 - Yeugou resorts to blackmail.<br>
16:51:44 - Yeugou threatens us with a GM action.<br>
<br>

[Sat Dec 15 16:49:37 2001] You say out of character, 'You don't have to ASK permission to kill mobs when they're just standing there.'<br>
[Sat Dec 15 16:50:09 2001] Yuegou says out of character, 'like I said Palimax, lets see how Vision handles it when everyone knows mobs they are setting up for are free game since no one owns mobs'<br>
[Sat Dec 15 16:50:14 2001] You say out of character, 'I encourage you to share this conversation, in it's entirety with the community.  All it'll show is that you complained about us camping greens and that we left.'<br>
[Sat Dec 15 16:50:16 2001] Asterisco says out of character, 'and that is all i ever have had to complain about in orontes behavior'<br>
[Sat Dec 15 16:50:50 2001] Orontes says out of character, 'Ok, I give up, you're 100% correct, setting up for Trak is the same as farming greens'<br>
[Sat Dec 15 16:50:51 2001] Yuegou says out of character, 'im sure alot of the less reputable guilds will be happy to know Vision will accept any mobs being ganked that they are setting up for, because Palimax says no one owns mobs'<br>
[Sat Dec 15 16:51:05 2001] Asterisco says out of character, 'i dont want to spread the word, or make a scene on any bourds, just saying orontes was really rude when he came in.'<br>
[Sat Dec 15 16:51:09 2001] Yuegou says out of character, 'its the same point Orontes, you just wont see it that way because one mob cons different than another'<br>
[Sat Dec 15 16:51:14 2001] You say out of character, 'Yuego, you moron, seriously, you asked us to leave and we left.'<br>
[Sat Dec 15 16:51:23 2001] You say out of character, 'You asked me to look at the situation and I did.'<br>
[Sat Dec 15 16:51:31 2001] You say out of character, 'We've honored EVERY request.'<br>
[Sat Dec 15 16:51:44 2001] Yuegou says out of character, 'I didnt ask you to leave, you left when you heard a gm was involved, dont act like you did me some act of kindness after barging in on the camp'<br>

Palimax, in a display of lamness, has posted a chat log. Damn. I figured you would not go that low to prove a point on something pointless. Look, send Yogurt a letter bomb or send him a 12 pack of beer. It this point it seems less like like Nag or Flame. It sounds more like a bitch fest between two old guys in Battery Park arguing over a chess match.<br>
<br>
Hey, btw, even though you might consider me to be an asshole or whatever, I am looking for a Fermentation Device. My money spends just as well as the next guys. Livtinth is selling a few, but I am not sure I can reach Livtinth before leaving for Holiday travel. Other guild members might be intrested in Skill modifying items. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=720.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=720.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=720.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=720.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=720.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=720.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=720.topic&start=141&stop=151>8</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showPrevMessage?topicID=720.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showNextMessage?topicID=720.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=720.topic&index=80><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=720.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.threadControl?topicID=720.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=720.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=720.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Diplomacy Corner<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Administration Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6>NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright 1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
