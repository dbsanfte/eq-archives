Mainly looking for the legs/breastplate the watchers dropped every blue moon.  As I am sure all of you who hunt there know beggers are always asking for the scrap armor that isnt needed...and tonight was no different.  We gave away the gaunts/boots as they dropped and kept whatever we needed.  <br>
One particular begger was really a pain, sending multiple tells to everyone of us asking for armor.  We let him loot boots and gaunts and then told him anything else would be used by us and the gravy train was over.<br>
Eventually we got lucky and legs dropped for one of our warriors who happened to not be in the kill group.  I locked the corpse for him until enough time had passed and noticed the begger was standing there watching right next to the &quot;rightfull looter&quot;.  <br>
I told the begger in say DONT LOOT THE CORSPE and then told the rightful looter to loot, stood up intending for him to loot.  The begger jumped in and looted the legs, put them on and ran over and zoned.  <br>
I told everyone there to petition that he had ninja'd and zoned as well.  We all petition that he ninja'd and after zoning I told him I was going to report him for ninja looting.  The begger zoned back in and I told the other group in zone via OOC to be careful he was ninja looting.  <br>
(pay attention this will be important later)<br>
The begger said in shout &quot;gee, I feel sorry about looting the legs, I am sorry&quot;<br>
-----TIME PASSES------<br>
Guides start answering our various petitions and we inform them what happened, eventually being escalated to full GM.<br>
The GM tells us that there is nothing he/she/it can do unless we can prove he intended to ninja loot and could we /report anything with proof.  Our cleric scrolls up /reports me saying dont loot and him saying sorry he looted.<br>
I figure that was enough proof..I mean wtf why would we LET him loot legs ?  Why would we say congrats and cheer the rightfull looter if we planned to give to the begger?<br>
---TIME PASSES----<br>
GM responds that he/she/it got the /report and since the begger expressed that he was sorry for looting, obviously he didnt mean to ninja loot and therefor we were SOL and nothing was going to be done.<br>
I start debating with the GM that :<br>
A- the begger was only level 37, could in no way kill the watcher that dropped the legs so couldnt rightfully loot them<br>
B-I told him not to loot, therefor expressing my desire for him to not get the legs<br>
C-he admitted looting them.<br>
D-If it was &quot;accidental&quot; why did he loot and run for zone?<br>
E-Why did he wait for me to stand up and then jump in and loot the watcher<br>
<br>
The GM started repeating &quot;rule 11&quot; and that since he said sorry, in he/she/it's eyes it was an accidental loot and not a ninja loot.  Unless we had hard proof that he &quot;intended&quot; to ninja loot, we were SOL.<br>
<br>
Many of us talked to the gm expressing basically the same thing and all we got was &quot;RULE 11&quot; &quot;RULE 11&quot; cant help you &quot;RULE 11&quot; RULE 11&quot;.<br>
<br>
The Beggers name in case you are wondering is:<br>
***** Xemus 37th warrior, unguilded ******<br>
<br>
Eventually the GM said that the legs would be taken from Xemus and destroyed. Also, that Xmeus would get an officail warning.  I asked why destroyed, why not given to the rightful looter?  no explanation given.<br>
<br>
Once again, I am boggled...if the GM can admit that Xemus shouldnt have the legs, WTF...why not give to the right person who should have gotten the legs?  <br>
<br>
I guess I should just be happy Xemus wont get the damn things, but then, I will never know if the GM was just saying that to get rid of the constant tells from us.<br>
<br>
SO, moral of the story for Ninja looter wanna be's.  just appologize after you loot Yelinak or trak...explain how sorry you feel and you wish you could give the item back...at a minimum you will have screwed over the rightful looter of the item and you might even get to keep it.<br>

<br>
I been there.<br>
I been the beggar at lvl35 and I been the guy *being annoyied by beggars* at lvl51.<br>
<br>
At lvl35, means like last December, this *sitting there and ask for not used drops* was an insider tip and no newbie new about it.<br>
<br>
I was there, sitting, not doing anything and very politely asking whether I could maybe loot a piece or two if noone needs them.<br>
Some very nice people said no and let the things rott. Thanks. But I repsected it, it was notmy kill and I had no right in looting it.<br>
Eventually I was able to get some gaunts and boots, that I still use.<br>
________<br>
<br>
At lvl51 Iam killing dorfs here and there.<br>
Icewell is flooded by people begging for  the armor. <br>
I been lvl35 as I did that. THe beggars there are like lvl5-10 or so and mostly wear almost full Royal Velium!<br>
That stinks. <br>
I mean, I been lvl35 and was sitting there waiting and asking politely - trying to in no way be annoying. I done that 2 evenings and I got gaunts and boots...<br>
<br>
But when I see lvl10 players sitting there ninjalooting whatever they see, then I really start thinking and it pisses me off how VERY lazy people became.<br>
________<br>
<br>
As for the incident.<br>
I don't think you can have more proof that the beggar was wrong and that he does in no way deserve the legs, but your warrior does.<br>
I do not know what else the GM can ask for other than all those reports and petitions, even with the beggar_01 admitting it.<br>
<br>
This is sad. Sometimes I think our GM's don't give rats ass about us.<br>
When I hear and see stories from great GMs on other servers, which are fun and nice and good people, and all I see from our GMs is ignorance...<br>
<br>
I got help from GMs usually when I got bugged, when I took 10000HP dmg off a 3 feet fall or so. Just usually took a while. But if you have such issues, they never care at all I think....<br>
And have you ever seen a GM on our server have fun or interact with the players?<br>
I didn't.<br>
<br>
Maybe its Verants Guidelines fault, but I have the impression our GMs and Guides are all day long just busy not to do anything that they could be *beaten up* by Verant - instead of adding some fun for the players in any way.<br>
They have their Guidelines book in front of them and have their prepared *case 329a - do this and that* thingies and just do this and that. Period.<br>
<br>
Again, may be Verants fault cause they may take action against the GM asap, if he says or does one thing that is not explicit written down as their duty and the way to handle things...<br>
Its just how it feels like when you (which is very rare) talk to a GM or Guide...<br>
<br>
Poor guys... or maybe still just.. ignorant...<br>
<br>
I alwazs thought GMs should also add some fun and interaction in the game... but I could be wrong <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center><a href="mailto:taino@jollyjokers.com"><img src="http://www.jollyjokers.com/images/sign.jpg"></a><br><b><font size=2>~ Taino the Earth Caller ~ <br>Cavalier of the 51st Call</b><br></font>

<br>
Every time you do something, someone is going to be annoyed.<br>
<br>
People who are ninja looters tend to also be assholes.<br>
<br>
Assholes write emails about percieved wrongs more often.<br>
<br>
People who are helped tend to not send email.<br>
<br>
The people in charge of gms are aware that the general population thinks gms suck.<br>
<br>
They fire about one or two gms a month.<br>
<br>
Firing gms who get emails lessens their email load.<br>
<br>
gms who piss off assholes get a lot of email.<br>
<br>
Gms who piss of regular folk by indifference get not much email, especially if they convince those folk that there is nothing they can do.<br>
<br>
Oh, and last but not least, the policies ask for a proof that the players have no way of obtaining.<br>
<br>
Next time you see a newbie hanging near your corpse do this:<br>
<br>
/petition note the time of this petition.  I have previously informed nOOb to not stand near this corpse as I get up to allow the rightfull looter to loot this.  My ability to petition again is your acknoledgement of having recieved this information.  Please respond so that I may get your name.<br>
<br>
who knows, perhaps you'll get lucky this time.<br>
<br>
doesn't it suck that that petition idea doesn't sound unreasonable? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucrydeeossiriand.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crydee Ossiriand</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/2/01 2:11:31 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ninja looters rejoice GM's on your side !</span><hr size=1> Beggers suck.<br>

Why TheF did they follow it up with dropping much better armor in a place that is popular to hunt but where everyone starts out un-kos? Maybe it's a way to provide &quot;content&quot;. This game is, after all, more about bitching at each other then about killing mobs. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :| --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/indifferent.gif ALT=":|"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Can't really blame the newbies for wanting some leftover armor, not as long ast they are polite about it. Better they get it then that it rots.<br>
<br>
Anyway, ninjalooters suck bigtime, and each of them are wortht of scorn and contempt. It was reallt out of line for the GM to suggest that the thief should get to keep his booty just because he said sorry. I'm glad he changed his mind.<br>
<br>
However, in spite of how much it sucks, I must agree with the GM about destroying the legs instead of giving them to the rightful owner. Why? Well, simply because they would have a LOT of fake ninjalootings otherwise. The rightful owner don't show up on time? Just &quot;ninjaloot&quot; and say you are sorry, and the GM will transfer the item to the person of your choise! Would suck even more to be a GM then... <p>Love, Edeina<br>
