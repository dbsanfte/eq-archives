<br>
Hmmm.. Probably not how you meant it, but it is actually pretty close. EW doesn't do Fear generally unless CT is up, nobody needs any of the normal armor drops there. VS is not on the normal schedule nor is Phin for pretty much the same reason. We do mobs for peoples epics when possible, but they rarely pop at convenient times when nobody else is around who wants them. For the record, the staff L2 uses actually has better stats in a lot of ways than the wiz epic though the epic has a nicer effect. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380>Qaman</a><BR>

<br>
I know Haloface since a long time.<br>
He has been a Joker for a longer time.<br>
We fight side by side every other week at least.<br>
I can assure you that Haloface is by far one of the best enchanters I have ever met. <br>
He knows how to play his class and he kicks ass. Nuff said.<br>
<br>
Oh and yes, I know more then one chanter...<br>
And... Please don't come with stuff like &quot;You suck too Taino blabla so everyone that can mezz a mob impresses you&quot; or something. I CAN between judge good and bad players.<br>
<br>
<br>
Generally speaking. Trying to insult Halo, or anyone because of their lvl, gear, skill, guild is seriously weak. Its.. wel.. just weak. <br>
You must have kinda run out of arguments as you wrote this, in a sheer moment of desperance and not knowing how to insult or conter Halo... I can't explain your statement in a different way.<br>
<br>
I tend to disagree with Halo often. Yes, GASP, Halo and I are close friends and I love his nipples. Still I can and do disagree with him and many of his opinions posted on this board (even if you may think I dont, because we BOTH usually disagree with you, too). Just as a hint. People can disagree in politics and opinions and still respect and like eachother. /panic<br>
<br>
&quot;So your stuck here with us Americans that you despise&quot;<br>
<br>
Which means what?<br>
I do not know what you could mean with that. Do we as euros have less rights now? Are we &quot;strangers&quot; or &quot;invaders&quot; now? Are we worth less or something? I don't get it.<br>
<br>
&quot;You should have left with most of the other euros to A-Bay. Becuase all the guilds left here are 95% american &quot;<br>
<br>
I can assure you that I personally know at least 50-100 people from Europe on this server. <br>
My guild has 50% euros too. I know at least 3 big guilds that JUST are euros. <br>
But besides all that... whats your point about it?<br>
<br>

I have known him since the server split, he is the best fucking enchanter i have ever met in my life,  he is a nice person both in game an out.  he always made time for me, or to help me when i needed it, he knows more than you can imagine, and he's seen almsot every zone in the game, and i agree with him, those people in A_Uber_Guild01 have forgotten how to have fun. ( with exeption for CB, they are just cool :-) )<br>
<br>
Haloface is one of the best people i know in EQ, he does have a *unique* look on things.... *cough* Nipples *cough*  but that's just him.<br>
<br>
And if you hasve a problem with him, you got a problem with me as well.<br>

<br>
Have you ever been in one?  Eternal Wrath is one of the top 5 guilds in Everquest...  and I hate to disappoint you.. but we have a great time.  The people in my guild are a great bunch of people who care about each other, make each other laugh on a regular basis... oh and kill mobs.<br>
<br>
Let me burst another bubble.  You want a common denominator for people in Uber-Guilds..  OK..   Id say the majority of people in Eternal Wrath either come from a Military Backgroud or a athletic background.   The guild is successful becuase people know how to work as a team and do the things needed to acheive lofty goals that we set for ourselves.  EW is prolly the purest form of a Democracy that any guild is..  Every member is an officer, we vote on everything.  Respect and Honor for each other is what my guild runs on..  we would fall apart without it.  Each and every member is more than capable and we have alot of the best players on the server.  Hands Down.  Thats in a Raid or a pickup group.   Eternal Wrath is, has been and always will be about Challenges, equality amoung peers, and having a good time..  not loot...<br>
<br>
Time enough to burst another bubble?  Sure..  how about Dreadnoks..<br>
Dreadnok.. Im prolly everything you hate.  I grew up as the son of a very well respected Sgt. in the CT. State Police.  I was popular in High School and had a great circle of friends.   I played Football too.  And I was Damn good at it..   my senior year I was All-State 1st Team Hartford Courant, All-State Offense New Haven Registar, 2nd Team All New England and Honorable Mention All-American at the center position.  I was recruited by Several schools.  University of Virgina, West Point, UConn, Umass, Lehigh, Lafayette.  I decided to attend the University of Rhode Island on a full football scholarship.  I started for 3 and half years. My mother and father came to each and every game, even if I wasnt playing.  Nothing is better when your father and mother gives you that look of pride,  its a great memory.  I also was in the Fraternity Phi Kappa Psi..   Greek Week winners 4 times in a row while I was there.  Partied my ass off, played some football and got a free education.   Went wild for a few years until I met my Wife.   (Married 3 months ago after 4 years of being together).  Beautiful, smart, with a great job as a Pedi ICU nurse at a Major world reknown hospital.  Me?  I work for the State right now.  Im the youngest supervisor in the state in my department, and Im working on finishing my teachers degree to teach history and coach football.<br>
Last nght I didnt log on becuase Me and my wife and my best friend and his wife went to New York, saw Les Mis (awesome!) then went to Mulberry St and had dinner at La Mela.  an Incredible Italian resturant.<br>
Basically, no matter what you do dreadnok..  im doing better than you..  if Im on EQ.. im doing better than you.. If im not.. im doing better than you.  <br>
Please go find a bridge and jump off<br>
