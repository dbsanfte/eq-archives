For your Info, Sir Banegrivm and I had long talks lately and our Guilds are now allied for the good of Norrath and also to have our information exchange as fast as possible.<br>
We are honored to be allied with the great Paladin of Light and I am sure it will be for the good of Ayonae Ro.<br>
<br>
________________________________________________<br>
<br>
West Commons had two camps. One being empty and the other housed dark elves all loyal to Naythox Thex the King of Neriak but yielded nae any information; other then that they seemed to be awaiting orders.<br>
<br>
Enter Befallen, the 1st floor housed necromancers and shadowknights everywhere. Some of these carried various Symbols of T'Vyl of varyious metal types. They all identified normally. The necromancers all had Gray Sr. Apprentice Robes which identified as a &quot;Robe of the Dead&quot;. Meaning the Lodge of the Dead, loyal to the Queen of Neriak. So it appears that the Queen has allied with Lanys. Now we know the real reason the Queen objected to the King's mannerisms of the hunt for Lanys, and why certain factions of Neriak allied with their King and Queen respectively.<br>
<br>
The second floor, further supported that Befallen was none other then Takish Hiz, the first elven city from which Innoruuk captured the first elven King and Queen and tortured them over hundreds of years to create the first Teir'Dal. Also note the flooring througout the entire place, can only be found in one other place throughout Norrath. Felwithe. The very same black and white checkerboard patterns.<br>
<br>
Remember that Solusek Ro arched the spine of the serpent mountains bringing the son down upon Tunaria (what we now know as Antonica) and scorched the lands. This caused all the formation of the desert of Ro and the elves abandoned what remained and made way to Faydwere where Felwithe and Kelethin came to be. The ruins are still scattered about, ever notice the scrawlings in east karana on the walls in the gorge? What goddess tis that depicted near the ruins? Contrasting black and white...definitely does nae look like Tunare.<br>
<br>
Also what further supports this is all the undead that appear throughout the area that are &quot;arisen&quot; and when slain and such seem to reflect as if armor and weapons (specifically to Arisen Knights) from an ancient time collapse into a heap. Also note that on three replacing the &quot;ELF Skeleton&quot; is now a Commander named Winddreamer I believe, sounds very elvish to me. He now carries the remenants in place for the Thex Mallet quest which coincidentally the Queen of Neriak wished, a quest coming from the Lodge of the Dead as well. Tis still unknown WHY she wanted the Thex Mallet.<br>
<br>
One other item of note on two twas that the room where the ogre remained with the locked door could nae be opened...at all. We waited for the key but could nae find it from the human female shadow knight that used to appear in the room across from the hall. The lock on said door twas also nae pickable by the 60th season rogue in our party. The only door she could nae pick within those foul blighted ruins.<br>
<br>
Down upon three we saw the same types of things but many Servants of T'Vyl as well as Guardians of T'Vyl...and heres the interesting part about it. Many were Half Elves. Some of the items down there identified normally, however were only useable by dark races...and half elves.<br>
<br>
It has been said Tayla Ironforge is a Bloodsabre and we know Lanys has sworn allegiance to the Bloodsabres. Definitely would explain the Half Elves. Something else, is theorized somehow the Nybright sisters of Lesser Faydark (still there) may be tied into it as one tis also named Tayla Nybright. Their father tis a fallen high elven paladin whose now seen as &quot;A Drunkard&quot; walking in Kelethin lamenting over his daughters who went to Antonica and &quot;something happened&quot; and they came back as murderous cutthroats. Also when the Nybright sisters are slain factions lost with Dervish Cutthroats. What happened that turned their hearts dark so? <br>
<br>
This would definitely explain how Lanys has half elf followers now, also...there tis a new quest in Qeynos which deals with investigations of the affairs therein, that rumor has it implicates an Ironforge as a Bloodsabre during the course of this investigative quest. Remember again, Lanys swore allegiance to the Bloodsabres. Also what is Tayla doing in Cabalis? If the theory is correct as stated about the alliance and Venril Sathir is involved, then that could explain her presence in Cabalis...Venril Sathir wants his empire back, and will stop at nothing.<br>
<br>
Also on three was Valizrae D'Tor the successor to Lanys as the Child of Hate, chained and shackled to the wall. Lanys twas to be ritually executed and Valizrae would siphon off the power that had been imbued into Lanys through the process of the sacrifice that would bring about Valizrae as the new child of hate. <br>
<br>
One final note, also how fitting that the Lodge of the Dead and the Queen side with Lanys...think about it, Takish Hiz is an old old old city...imagine all the bodies entombed within. Their own virtual army, just waiting for the Lodge to slowly bring to unlife. Every wonder why the place now has so much undead within? Also remember Bloody Kithicor, it starts with Tyrana Sil who takes Nurgles Stone to Neriak...she being a known member to the Lodge of the Dead.<br>
<br>
Also note she stands on the highest floor with Carson McCabe, she being an emissary/envoy to High Keep...the alliance becomes deeper entwined. Also note the Teir'Dal torturer on the lower floor and the lich of a Teir'Dal above. Also one final thing, all beings within shared the same faction.<br>
<br>
Much to ponder...  <p><center><a href="mailto:taino@jollyjokers.com"><img src="http://www.jollyjokers.com/images/sign.jpg"></a><br><b><font size=2>~ Taino the Earth Caller ~ <br>Cavalier of the 51st Call</b><br></font>
