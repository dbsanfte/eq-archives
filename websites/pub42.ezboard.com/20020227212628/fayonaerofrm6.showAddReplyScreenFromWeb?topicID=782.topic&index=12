Dear Sandin:<br>
<br>
In reference to your sister, you have made a very important discovery, I think: that even though the ratio of players is terribly skewed now towards highly experienced players, there are still people coming to the game for whom everything is new, and one of the reasons that people complain about 'newbie beggars' in the game is that well, people *ruin* the game for many of them.  By 'ruin' I mean some of what you describe, in addition to twinking; new players come into the game, and instead of having a chance to learn the joys and pitfalls of the game for themselves, they run into some 'well meaning' players who force feed them a tutorial on how to 'optimize' their character, from what gear they should get, to where they should exp for fastest levelling, etc, and an image is formed in the players mind that *this* is what the game is about - getting uber gear and levelling to 50 as fast as possible so that they can start playing the 'real' game, where everyone else is.  Many people who might get a lot out of EQ, and become good players, come face to face with this reality and quit, or put their noses to the grindstone and level to 50 with blinders on, missing out on much of the game and valuable skill development in the process.<br>
<br>
I started playing EQ about 10 months ago, when the game was relatively 'mature', and had a fantastic time dying over and over again in Gfay, Steamfont, Crushbone, and Unrest, and was starting to explore Antonica, when some 'well meaning' friends suggested that I could get great experience in the Oasis and that I should head there.  Getting my first Orc highway group was great, but it was the beginning of my introduction to the soulless, maddeningly boring experience grind that many of my companions seemed to be hell bent on.  I was also given my first piece of twink gear from another chanter at that time, a polished bone mask (which I still have).  About that time, two of my partners friends (we all started playing about the same time) asked if I would join a guild with them; I did, but it was a bad fit - it was a guild comprised mostly of hyper kids who were out for loot, and I didn't stay long.<br>
<br>
Without boring everyone to tears with the rest of this story, I and my partner found that the only way to 'keep' the game for ourselves, and not have it be ruined, was to insist on learning it all on our own.  In the last 8 months we've crawled, at appropriate level, with equally inexperienced friends, all of the old world dungeons except Najena (went there late for a couple of quests) and Sol B (this is on our list), several of the Kunark dungeons (Kurn's tower, Droga, Kaesora), and ToFS in Velious.  We've died a LOT, and had a blast, but one of the sad things is that many of these places were completely empty except for us (or one or two farmers) when we got there.  In many of the mid level dungeons, you *can't* get pickup groups any more, yet there are 100+ in LOIO, 70 in the Oasis, and 100+ in the OT and Dreadlands.<br>
<br>
You may think that these are all twinks and/or alts, trying to level up as fast as they can, but the simple truth is many of them SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ELSE, having been 'indoctrinated' at an early age.<br>
<br>
Case in point:  Last night, our little guild took two of our newer but higher level members, a 45 Necro, and a 42 SK, on their *first* dungeon crawl (if you want to call it that, we were just sticking our heads in Nurga, since our planned target of Droga was, amazingly enough, taken with two groups that night).  When I pleaded with them that our ranger was our main assist, and to please stay on one mob at a time (I am an enchanter, mind you, so the adds were getting quickly parked), the SK looked right at me and said, Why?  I then explained that fighting multiple mobs was a drain on the healers resources, and besides, many of the mobs here were casters who would heal themselves or cast at players.  They insisted on soloing mobs for a while, until we came upon a room of rockchanters, and our poor SK watched in dismay as the (low blue to her) creature healed itself faster than she could damage it...  She swore for a while after that, but assisted the Ranger from then on <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  The necro, on the other hand, insisted on running herself and her pet ahead of the party, periodically screaming 'my pet is fighting xxx, come here', which was not a party threatening experience under these circumstances, but will be soon...<br>
<br>
On the plus side, I'd like to add that the most fun we had over the course of the evening was *finding* the Mines of Nurga in FM that night, after we found that Droga was taken.  With the new graphics, everything looks different, we had never been in that dungeon, and Faer took us to what he *thought* was it but was in fact the burynai mining camp.  Our group of eager beavers swarmed the 'zone entrance' only to be met by a horde of angry burynai, quickly accompanied by a couple of giants, goblins and a brute that wandered down the hill into the carnage.  Several minutes of stark raving chaos ensued, punctuated by mezz messages, 'the next target *is* ' messages, a dead cleric (who was, amazingly enough, the only fatality), and about 20 dead bodies on the ground when it was all over...  Oh and btw, our SK was *thrilled* about the shovel she got from the Mines, insisted that we take screenshots of her wielding it, and started screaming at the mobs to 'Die by my shovel, you XXX!'.  She has had more fun with that shovel than the superb weapon we brought her from KC the other day... <br>
<br>
I guess my 'point' (if there is one) in this message is that, even though EQ is a very mature game now, those of us who are are more or less experienced should be mindful that there are still people for whom this game is new, and that, if they 'grow up' having been exposed to nothing but standing in an open field killing mobs like a machine, and buying all their gear in EC or having it given to them, and then we complain that there are no good players coming up, we should accept that we are in part culpable for this situation.  You know, that tired old adage: 'Give a man a fish, they eat for a day, teach them to fish, they eat for a lifetime...'<br>
<br>
Granted, 'teaching' (or as we do it, more like the blind leading the blind) can get tiresome, but every once in a while, the rewards are *so* worth it.  Our ranger, who played *very* fast and loose (read: lots of corpses) when we started grouping with her, is becoming a very skilled player, and loves her role; grouping with her is a pleasure now, and we're working on getting our Sebilis keys with her leading the way.  And, ye gods, we have humbling experiences almost every day.  Last night was a prime example, my getting squashed in TWO rounds in KC the other night on a single resisted mezz was another, entering a whole new world of strategy myself it seems... and with the highest level folks in our guild just now doing the Vox/Naggy zergling rush raids, and the Planes and everything else still ahead of us, I am sure we will get a lot more 'learning experiences' <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
Bleh, I've rambled on enough.  Just try to remember, those of you with jaded eyes, that the world *is* new  for more folks out there than you might think, and before you hand out that bit of twink loot, or give some well meaning 'advice' on how to optimize themselves, if it might not be better to point them towards a dark hole in the ground and say 'Why don't we look in *there*...' <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
