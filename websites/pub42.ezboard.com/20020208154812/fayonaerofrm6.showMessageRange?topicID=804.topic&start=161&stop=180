You keep telling me that we're not the altrusts that we paint ourselves to be.  What then was our motivation for including this warrior in the kill and the treasure?<br>
<br>
...and I'm not making this warrior out to be anything except what he was.  He was someone who wanted a fiar shot at a Green Dragon Scale for helping us kill Serv.  He got his shot, and to my knowledge he has no complaint about getting it.  If he feels otherwise, he can send me a tell or post here.<br>
<br>
Vision didn't need the help of lots of people on this server, but by saying so, we're not making them any less significant.  By your logic, if you wern't necessary for the kill of Serv this weekend, you're some sort of worthless cow.  It boggles the imagination that somehow <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  YOU</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> are upset about this whole thing.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Everybody actually involved with the event is  as happy as a clam.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Few deaths, painless kill, a shot at a scale for the warrior, fun for Kinuvan, and an epic for Taygon.<br>

<br>
Me?  No, not that I know of.  Have any of your members helped us with Velkator...  ...I'm not sure.  Did someone else in Vision ask someone in your guild to help with Velkator some evening?  Maybe.  Based on your post, even probably.  We have guests at a lot of our raids; and when we do, when it's appropriate, we try to reward them much like we'd reward our own members, because that's how you treat guests.<br>
<br>
We often find ourselves with guests in places like the old-world planes and Kael.  They know that overall we're not too interested in most of the drops and we're not big on hoarding them and selling MQ rights.<br>
<br>
If you have some first-hand knowledge of me sending your guildmates tells begging them to come be slaves in the Vision army, to toil at our labors, to mine gold for me to line my throne with, then, please, do share.<br>

I'm considering adopting Casus Belli's loot policy as outlined by TPF.  It seems less of a headache. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4868>Palimax Sceleris</a>,

We said he could roll BEFORE he helped us kill the dragon. His help was not needed, we could have killed the dragon just as easily without his help. You are saying we are greedy because we CONSIDERED telling him his help was not wanted? I would say yes, we are greedy. We are so self centered and greedy that want to help out our fellow members. And we are jerks, because we won't let outsiders fair shots at the loot the GUILD obtains for it's members. Oh wait.... we just did....<br>

I an a committed player, I put in 30-40 hours a week, sometimes more. I like random. I like the idea that someone being a slow leveler(often due to raids or helping others) doesn't give up the right to win nice things. <br>
<br>
I'd be happy as a clam if the first plate thurg bp my guild ever got in a raid went to a level 50 friend of the guild who was with us that day. <br>
<br>
Why? <br>
<br>
I don't give a rats ass about loot, but I get a pretty nice sense of achievement when I can say &quot;Hey, check out X's bp, I helped him get that, and it was a milestone for our guild.&quot;. <br>
<br>
But then, you can keep on flaming me, after all, everyone who knows me agrees I am one of the most, if not THE  most loot whoringestest warrior on server. Right? And i'm just so envious of your uber leet warriors I could DIE.<br>
<br>
Well, if it makes ya feel better to say it anyway.<br>
<br>
I'll say it again since the foreign concept has trouble taking root in your noggins. I don't care about the loot, your looting rules, how nice it was to let someone get a chance at loot, etc.<br>
<br>
I said(many times) that if you belittled me in the way i'm seeing you belittle that warrior, i wouldn't be tempted to help you much.<br>
<br>
Was it nice of you to let him do it? Yes.<br>
<br>
Is it rude to remind someone they are only there &quot;by your leave&quot;- repeatedly? Yes.<br>
<br>
Are there guilds that wouldn't do even that? Yes.<br>
<br>
Are there guilds that would do that and call it good enough? Yes.<br>
<br>
Are there guilds out there that would thank that warrior for helping out, and not feel the need to let everyone know again and again that a)they didn't need or owe him anything and b)how great they were to let him help? Yes. <br>
<br>
And these are the good guilds. That's the kind of people I like to be around and be associated with.<br>
<br>
<br>
Incidently Connador, english is not a dead language, it is a living one. This being the case, words evolve over time.<br>
<br>
I had a character before this, also surnamed shortpimp. He was a halfling, had that elvis face. I decided since he was a) short and halflings were b) pimp he would be called...wait for it....shortpimp. New char made, gets to 20 and i give him my other chars surname. Happens all the time.<br>
<br>
The real question is why you're nitpicking with my name instead of say, mogur (shamanpimp).<br>

  Once again I have to give a hat's off to Palimax. No matter what anyone that would pretend to really know his charcter or his motives would say, I can tell you that I have seen him lead vision for a long, long time now. It still amazes me that he has the patience and resolve to lead this guild in the directions it has gone and continues to show honor, honesty and kindness in spite of the crap people constantly shovel into his yard. People like Membrayne, Allamar,Dammur, Iciana that have posted here are all kind, and fair and usually do thier best to selflessly help thier friends. In guild or not. They are all genuine, up-front intelligent people who will always gladly help a friend, and I know this for a fact and so do lots of other people... so PLEASE  PLEASE to the next person that comes on here and chooses to make a fool out of themselves trying to shed a bad light on Vision or Palimax.

<br>
You mean, owe him anything except the fair shake he got at the green scale, right?<br>
<br>
You're the only person who seems to think we're making any less of the warrior's contribution to the raid.  I'm just making it clear that, however helpful he was, his presense wasn't necessary -- nor for that matter, was mine, as I died pulling him (forgot to adjust clip-plane) and was left to rot on the ground while they killed him.<br>
<br>
You avoid any question asked of you where you don't like the answer.  You continue to harp on the most insignificant of things, pretending you have some insight into the situation, which you most assuredly, do not.<br>
<br>
Don't you get it?  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> EVERYONE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> who was at Serv this weekend walked away satisfied with the outcome.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> EVERY LAST PERSON</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> who was there got a fair shot at treasure - except Kinuvan, whom we kicked to the curb the second his resist song ended.<br>
<br>
The only reason the Serv killing even got mentioned at ALL was to demonstrate their are times that the person with the luckiest dice (Azeroth or Small) wasn't the person who'd get the loot.  The dice this time only determined if it was staying in-guild, or going to our guests.<br>
<br>
If in my posts I've inadvertantly made that warrior look bad, I'm sure he knows I respect him, or I would have NEVER given him a chance at the scale. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4868>Palimax Sceleris</a>,

No, that's kinda the opposite of my view. I know its hard to take it in. <br>
<br>
Frankly I wonder about your mental status if you got the above quote out of reading my posts. Get some sleep.<br>
<br>
When you have someone help you do something, like say a warrior not of your guild who you let help you kill a dragon, then go on to talk about how little that person meant to the raid, you belittle them. And you and your guildmates have belittled warrior X a LOT in this post.<br>
<br>
That's rude as all hell.<br>
<br>
And it's not something that'd make me help you at all anymore, if i were that person.<br>
<br>
But this situation ^ is what you are touting as proof that you have such good character.<br>
<br>
I'd say its a pretty poor example of good character, and I think I hit a nerve to have you and so many of your guildmates responding with flames- but none of you ever contradict my point of view with any arguements(although you do like arguing my imagined points of view as you think them up). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ulummusl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LummusL</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/14/02 11:10:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=804.topic&index=168>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Things you do after leaving a guild...</span><hr size=1> Honesty and Morality. Simple words. Just three sylabols. It can be pronounced by most human beings no later than the 3rd grade, yet many will spend their entire lives knowing only that its a word in the English language yet will probably never understand the meaning. It is one of those words that is very subjective in its perception, that much is true. Religions try to define these words and codify a means of fulfilling their definitions.Governments try to legislate it. Wars are fought over these words, destroying property and creating pain and suffering.<br>
<br>
So what might be the best way to define a concept that is expressed by a simple word, but yet carries a meaning as muddled as all of Human existance?<br>
<br>
Maybe it can all go back to the Golden Rule:<br>
<br>
Treat others in the same manner that you wish to be treated. Respect others in the same manner you wish to be respected. If you believe your actions would offend your own sensibilities, than maybe those actions are not the best solution.<br>
<br>
Ok, I really did not want to post a preaching statement. I also did not want to come here to guild-bash either. There is too much of that going on. Maybe it would be more in the intrest of all the parties here to examine their actions, and decide, if the roles were reversed, would they be as content?<br>
<br>
I have a feeling some would be, while some would not. That is if they really stopped..... and thought about it.<br>

Crist0 just can't seem to distinguish between which version was applied to this scenario.  To say that the warrior wasn't needed to accomplish the kill is a simple fact, not an insult.  Saturday my guild brought several guests to Hate; one of them was a paladin who I awarded (not allowed to roll, but awarded) the paladin epic bp.  None of these guests were *needed*, but to say so doesn't belittle them.  We were glad to invite them, and they were glad to be invited.  <br>

Do you have multiple personalities or something??<br>
<br>
Maybe you should schedule a meeting with all your other personalities and come to one decision and save the rest of us the Head Ache of explaining the logic to 8 or 10 different Christ(Zero)'s.<br>
<br>
If you dont like other guild loot procedures dont go on raids with that guild and dont even THINK of joining a guild that doesnt have /rand as its only method for guild distribution.<br>

I just hope this reaches the &quot;I dont give a rats ass about loot&quot; Christ(zero) personality.<br>

Biggi, for your information I have been playing EQ since beta 4 and this obviously is not my first character.  I probably saw Vox and Nagafen before you even started playing the game, but what difference does that make?  To be honest with you, it wouldn't matter even if you had been on a dragon raid before me, you're still an idiot.  When a dozen different people have to post and lay the facts out for you in terms a fourth grader could understand for 5+ pages in a thread, you must be a complete fool not to get it by now.<br>
<br>
I have no &quot;holier than thou&quot; attitude.  I just hate seeing people troll just to troll.  Obviously that's what you are doing to Palimax and Vision, otherwise you must be dumber than dirt.<br>

I know lots of people will Say  &quot;Why not be nice and give it to someone who wouldnt get&quot;<br>

Ya..  a nice gesture... in theory..  until the first time you do it and then everytime you clear NToV or go on a raid you have 6500000  tells and people hanging out waiting for some handout.. <br>
<br>
So you need to find a system for dealing with it that works..  Vision seems like they have a firm grip on this.. and can handle it well...  Also a reason why you will almost never see EW invite non apps or give people loot for no reason..  ANd since we go through about 1,000,000plat (not a exaggeration) a month in Peridots and regents we sell stuff that isnt no-drop <p>Lleauaric Fyrewynd<br>Sorcerer<br>Knight of Eternal Wrath<br>Ayonae Ro<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3749">Gear</a>

<br>
Where did you get the clam statement btw? Wasn't from one of my posts ) I said..oh screw it its like 3 posts up i am not sayin it again.<br>
<br>
I remain anonymous(somewhat) when i spout personal opinions, much as I am doing on this thread. I don't like bringing guild into it because a) well. they aren't part of it. and b) most of them don't give a rats ass about what i'm arguing over anyway most of the time. <br>
<br>
If you really were wondering who I was I do put my name down under posts sometimes, I just don't feel the need to end all my posts typing out my name, some silly quote, then guildname. God forbid I ever get some gaudy dorf-wearin-nothing-but-a-smile gif to tack on as a sig. <br>
<br>
I know most of you will appreciate that.<br>
<br>
Nope. Didn't get a shot at anything, didn't care to get a shot at anything, you mighta missed it up in all that, but i really don't give fig newtons for loot.<br>
<br>
I had fun, I hit things(well, slashed), I got to talk some (friendly)smack back and forth with a guy i know in the guild doing the raid. That classifies as a &quot;Good Day&quot; in my book. Only thing missing was training a guildie chanter.<br>
<br>
I don't know what went on at the raid, thats not the issue, his role(hence he himself) was belittled on these boards. I probably wouldn't have cared about that either, but it was in a post explaining how good x guild's policy was.<br>
<br>
I saw it, so I make a statement:<br>
<br>
If I helped you on a raid, and you belittled me, in tells or in an exceedingly public place(these boards), I wouldn't want to help you much anymore.<br>
<br>
I was told it was very unusual for a guild to even allow this respected nonguildie to fight such a mob. I gave an example from personal experience of the exact same nature to the contrary.<br>
<br>
I don't have a beef with vision, or its officers, or Palimax.<br>
<br>
I just called you on something you posted.<br>
<br>

I love contradictions, don't you?<br>
<br>
Shorty, I know alot of people from FD, and have a pretty good opinion of your guild, as well as most members of it i have come across. <br>
<br>
You however, have been on my list of people not to exp with since i first grouped with you.<br>
<br>
Thats about as close to a flame as you're gonna get, and a flame for a flame seems perfectly fair.<br>
<br>
<br>
Kaitan, this ISN'T about loot, stop bringing up loot forget about it. This is about saying in a pretty public place that x person helped kill something, then putting emphasis on the facts that they didn't need his help and they didn't owe him anything.<br>
<br>
Maybe you missed the part where i said you're right, he wasn't needed and he wasn't owed anything. Thats not the point of this at all. <br>
<br>
The point is its rude to point that fact out repeatedly to that person and everyone else that this was so. <br>

I don't object to you or anyone else commenting on any subject you like on these boards. They are here for just such a reason.<br>

What I meant by &quot;butting-in&quot; is that I think it's a waste of your time and ours for you to spend 4+ pages &quot;sticking-up&quot; for a warrior who got a good deal, and who hasn't complained.<br>
