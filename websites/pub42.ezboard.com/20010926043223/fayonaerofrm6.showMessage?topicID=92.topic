No big deal...we zoned back in, found her corpse, and dragged it to the zoneline.  She was about to rez herself when someone in our group noticed a level 60 cleric with his epic (Gladstone from Eternal Wrath), fighting at the zone.  Cool!  Reviviscence (is that how you spell it?).  Or not....<br>
<br>
Jess watched while Gladstone and his group fought, and during breaks in the action, asked him politely for a rez.  She even healed him during battles.  She had to ask 3 different times before finally getting the answer of &quot;busy&quot;.  Additional requests were either ignored or met with basically the same answer.  Now, I don't know what Jess and Gladstone said to each other after that, but I'm sure it was less than civil.<br>
<br>
It pissed me off that someone was either too selfish or too lazy to spare the 12 seconds and effort it takes to click on an icon.  She didn't ask him to cross the zone, or multiple zones.  She didn't give him a tell from another zone.  She didn't ask rudely, or demand that he do it.  She wouldn't even have needed a heal afterwards.  And, it's not like it requires mana.  He was hunting at the zone, so the action wasn't non-stop.  I suppose he just felt like being difficult.<br>
<br>
I said a few things in /ooc about Gladstone's character and immediately got tells from several other people explaining that I should give up.  Apparently he denied these people rezzes in the past.  Gladstone responded numerous times, and it's ironic how he wasn't too busy to type responses in /ooc.  With all the typing he did, he probably could have rezzed 5 people.  Oneil, one of Gladstone's guildmates, was praising him for not doing the rez.  Gladstone gave the impression that since he was level 60, he could do whatever he wanted.  Heck, he'd probably charge his own mother gas money to drive her 1 block.<br>
<br>
By now you've gathered I consider Gladstone to be a prick and Oneil is not far behind.  I hope this kind of behavior is not indicative of everyone in Eternal Wrath.<br>
<br>
What do you guys think?  Sure, he's not obligated to do the rez, but any other decent person would have certainly agreed.  I've never run across another cleric with their water sprinkler who refused to do a rez.  In fact, many offer before you have time to ask, like one of the clerics from Bunnies of Chaos who not only drug my corpse to the zone in SS, but did the rez, all without me even knowing she was in the zone.  Nice person.  I wish I could remember her name.<br>

Assuming that Kleg's story is the whole and objective story from all sides (there is always at least two sides to every story, and there may very well be some private tells or personal backgrounds that Kleg doesn't know about), the ress would definitly have been the nice thing to do. <br>
<br>
On the other side, not being nice is not the same thing as being a total scumbag. From what I understand, this person already HAD his corpse and a good ress aviable, but wanted one from Gladstone instead because his ress was slightly better. It was never that the victim would be without a ress and have to walk three continents through all kinds of perils to get to his corpse. No, he had his corpse and he had a ress, but he wanted a better ress.<br>
<br>
I like to be nice, I would most likely have done the ress if I had been the cleric with epic and the person asking was polite and not known to me as a villian. My cleric will most likely get to the level 49 one day, might even get his epic. I don't think I will ever deny someone who bring his corpse to me, asks politely and wait until I have time. HOWEVER! If I ress someone then I am doing them a favor, I am NOT fulfilling my duty to them. Except my friends, groupmates and guildmates, I do not owe anyone a ress.<br>
<br>
Also, same goes with the enchanters. If you see a enchanter with his epic, is he then obliged to buff you? It wouldn't cost him mana, and it's a better buff then your own groups chanter can provide. Is he doing his duty if he buff you, and a scumbag if he refuse? I say he's being nice if he buff you, and not being a hero or a scumbag in either case. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

Makes sense, people at level 60 rarely hunt Karnor's for xp.<br>
That questmob is quite deep in the basement, right?<br>
I doubt anyone could have brought a corpse down there without huge risk of wiping out the group with a train. Karnor aggro is horrible enough as it is.<br>
Still, I'm sure everyone including himself would have been happier if he had used a more polite attitude. I understand that the tells for ports and resses can annoy wizards and clerics sometimes, but if the question is polite then a polite no seems fair to me. <br>
<br>
If I ask a wizard for a port I do get a bit upset if I get a basic fack you in response, and somewhat annoyed if they don't respond at all. A polite no is fully accepted of course, their time is their own. People demanding favors, asking rudely and getting upset by a no, those are a plague to the game. But those who don't have time to help, or simply don't feel like it, they should also be polite to fellow players, even to strangers who ask for favors. Doesn't take all that much time to type &quot;sorry, no&quot;. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

Seems he was at the zone Edeina.<br>
<br>
And as for the topic...<br>
*shrugs*<br>
As a cleric, I would have rezzed.<br>
His choice however, he chose not to. Just a matter of the person he didn't help to make a note and not help him in the future.<br>
This game is all about scratching peoples' backs. If you don't help people, if you don't get help yourself, if you don't interact... what's the point of playing a multiplayer game?<br>

My bad, sometimes i just reply to a post on impulse without re-reading the whole thread first <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Hmm, wonder why level 60:s are fighting at places like right moat and the zonelines. oh well, none of my business. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

Heck, he'd probably charge his own mother gas money to drive her 1 block.&quot;<br>
<br>
I've known Gladstone for quite awhile now, and you hit the nail right on the head here.  Those people that told you to give it up were right.<br>
<br>
Another example of his character can come from his stint in Nightmare Clan.  He had a RL buddy with a twinked rogue. While we (Gladstone and I) hunted together, as guildmates in an all-guild group, he insisted that I lottoed against him on all rogue loot (whether it be rogue only, or just rogue useable, and suited mostly to the rogue class; this 'stuff' would have normally been something that I would have just been awarded in an all guild group like this, without a lotto, because I needed it), so he could twink his friend.<br>
<br>
I tried to be Gladstone's friend for the longest time.  But after getting shit on numerous times, I gave it up.  Save yourself the stress and just put the guy on ignore.  If you want to know who all his RL buddies are, so you can watch out for them as well, give me a tell in the game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ugladstone.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gladstone</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(2/26/01 12:54:05 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Clerics and their sprinklers - /rude Gladstone</span><hr size=1> WooT!! My frist trip to this board and I already have my own subject flame line, excellent.<br>
<br>
1) Verix was up at the time we were gatering at the zone, so we were actually in a huge hurry to get down there before someone beat us to it.<br>
<br>
2) Rezzing someone involves not only the rez itself, but also the heal after they pop.  Rez (8 secs with the epic I think), plus another 16 secs for the PoG BP to work.  Not a huge amount of time, but something that's difficult to squeeze into the middle of a 10 mob train trying to keep your enchanter alive.<br>
<br>
3) I don't mind rezzing people, but they do have to wait until it is convenient for me.  Not just possible to squeeze it in, but convenient.<br>
<br>
4) The person asked me a time or 2 (In the middle of a 10 mob karnor zone train) and I told them I was busy.  So, they begin to flame me about what an asshole I am for not dropping everything I was doing to rez them.  At this point they get the big screw off from me.<br>
<br>
5) I don't recall you actually helping me get my epic, so where it is I owe you anything is a little puzzling to me.<br>
<br>
6) Just because there did not appear to be any mobs there during the break in the action does not mean our puller is not out and about with 4 or 5 mobs on him.<br>
<br>
7) Mooshi was present in those HS lottos as well Biggins.  It was not just rogue specific loot, but Bloodpoints and a Sash of the Dragonborn if I recall correctly (you may have to refresh my memory, this was all several months ago and really late at night).  We were trying to reequip a naked character at the time that hadn't been used in quite a while, you know the details.  If your GM was cool with it, perhaps you should just relax.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Biggins, that is a nice epic weapon you have.  I recall helping kill your general in kith and kill Phin to get your kedge robe.  Both of those things happened after I left NC.  But, hey, I guess I'm just a total asshole, right?<br>
<br>
Anything else?<br>
