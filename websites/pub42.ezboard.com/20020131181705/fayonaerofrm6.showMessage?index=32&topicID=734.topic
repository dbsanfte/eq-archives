If you want to see what happens when you get self-motivated bard, talk to Kelraz. He organized numerous events, including Vox and Nortlav runs, to get what he needed -- and because he came out saying &quot;I'm doing this, here is who I've got willing to do it and it's going to go down on this day&quot; when he approached people, he got a lot more willing volunteers. I deleveled (hey, it's a palindrome!!) to fight Vox with him.<br>
<br>
He's an annoying guy, but damn if I can't respect that it's HIS epic quest. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ulogixspybreak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Logix Spybreak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>AyRo IRC OP</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/20/01 1:14:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=734.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: They said give up your Epic.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   If you want to see what happens when you get self-motivated bard, talk to Kelraz.

<br>
I concur.<br>
<br>
There were times that I did not have faith in Kelraz that we could take things down with the small amount of force, such as the Scale Keeper in the Hole, but, we did.  I am much more likely to show up to help someone that KNOWS what the mob does, knows how to get there, knows every little detail about the target and can get the people there.  I am NOT very willing to help someone who hasn't taken the time to level to 54-55, hasn't done enough research on the target in question, has to have someone else round up people for them, can't lead the raid on their own.  I honestly should not be a mob 'beta tester' to see what spells land on it.<br>
<br>
Additionally, in a lot of guilds, some epics are just going to be low priority.  Rogue, Ranger and Monk epics are some of the easiest to get, and they help the guild on the whole by improving damage output.  Enchanter and Cleric epics are by far the most beneficial to raids.  Necro epic is going to be low priority, since even most Necros shun it.  However, who do you think is going to have first dibs on a Kael/Thurg/ToV Robe?  A Necro.  Why?  Because it's damned nice for CRs.  There are just going to be more important things that help the guild much more on the whole.  Decking out your tanks in Thurg/Kael/SS armor is going to be much more worth the effort than decking out every Paladin with an epic.<br>
<br>
Lastly, epics and other nice items are also treated in most guilds as a special reward for effort and loyalty.  The majority of my guild agreed that my guild leader, Dashmoo, should receive a chain BP that dropped, because of her hard efforts and long nights she put in.  Semidie, guild Necro officer, finally received her epic, and deservedly so, after her longtime loyalty to the guild.<br>
<br>
If the guild isn't worth being put ahead of you, then you aren't going to be worth being put ahead of the guild. <p><table>

If that's the problem, you can stay in that guild as they gradually acrue power, and become a respected member, so there's no question as to who deserves bard epic most. Or, you can find another guild which perhaps may be a vehicle to the epic. Given the fact you left over not getting an epic, I don't think you liked your old guild, or your old guild didn't mean as much to you as your epic. Honestly, I don't think you'll have much chance as a 52 bard, because 52 is a simply unacceptable level for most guilds who may be able to do said bard epic. <br>
<br>
There is also another reason they may have told you that. They may have felt you just didn't deserve your epic, which is also a legitimate reason, though probably not in your eyes. If that was the case, perhaps there are other things besides epic you need to work on. <br>
