The next day I logged on and was loading up a cleric on a second account (who was also logged in ssra).  I hadnt been online more than 3 minutes when a group of Defenders of Valor zoned in half beaten to death.  One of them says &quot;nice train&quot; and  another one says &quot;yeah we always have problems when they are around&quot;.  Was kinda funny since I hadnt even been online for a few mins and hadnt left the temple.  I must be a damn good trainer...better than sharn!<br>
<br>
That is the second time that a member of Defenders of Valor has made rude comments towards me and I felt it was for no other reason than just because of the tag by my name.  I tried to explain to the guy that he must have me confused with someone else, and explained that I hadnt even left the zone yet.  He ofcourse called me a liar and said he saw me with his own eyes.  /shrug   guess some ppl are just really closed minded at times.  Anyone that knows me knows im a straight up guy and dont bs around.

In the past, myself or my guildmates have been wronged in some manner or other by one or more members of many prominent guilds on the server (guilds even L2 has heard of!).  XA, CB, EW, VV, ToV, etc etc.  Sometimes the situations have provoked endless cursing of whichever guild was the culprit of the moment.  But by the same token members of these guilds have been quite helpful at other times.  <br>
<br>
Point being, don't think horribly of a guild over some single incident.  Of course, if the officers of that guild are unconcerned with the actions of their members, or there is a consistent pattern of offenses by members of said guild, flame away.   <br>

I feel my point may have been twisted some what. Let me draw some light onto this. My point is not to hold grudges against a group of people that wrong you on occosation or more. My point is that if a guild follows the pattern of wronging you, or anyone for that matter, then I don't find it wrong to not want to help them. Let me use one of the things posted somethwhat. You just log in and are accused of training, you belong to Guild Y and people from Guild X are accusing you, bad mouthing you and generally being an ass. Now my point would not to be immediately start hating guild X, not even close. IF you even care to, and it is always your choice, you should follow up with the guild officers of that guild. Chances are if they are decent people they will resolve the the problem. I personally wouldnt even think a thing of it. Tempers flare and people say stuff they shouldnt. To agree with a previous post, USE COMMON SENSE. I would expect that any guild that chooses to be &quot;good&quot; wouldnt purposely go outta their way just to be an ass. So I Give them the benefit of the doubt and move on.<br>
<br>
It is when something has occured more than once, and a pattern has developed then I agree with showing disfavor towards a Guild. Guild X trains the ever lovin shit outta you and your group. This is not the first time it is the tenth, you have repeatedly talked with the guild leadership of guild X and they tell you tough shit and no they wont help with your CR even though the only reason you are dead is bc of their bad game play. So Guild X leadership has stated that they will train you if it suits them and do not care what happens to you or anyone else outside of their guild. Ok Fine now I avoid Guild X like the plaque.<br>
<br>
Part 2:<br>
You are just chillin and some member of guild X comes to you and asks for a Res. You refuse and they ask why. You tell them of the previous events and that since their guild see's fit to run over people as they choose and you dont agree with that. You refuse to help them. They claim that they never trained you so why hold anything against them.<br>
SIMPLE: If you belong to a guild then you agree with what they are doing and how they play the game. This is not to say that everything everyone does in the guild is always right or wrong. BUT guild X has proven over time, after many events that they care nothing about the play of other Characters or how their actions affect others. If you are a memeber of guild X and disagree with the actions of the Guild Either work to change the guild or find a new guild. They obviously arent doing what you feel is good Gaming. My usuall repsonse to someone who says &quot;but I never did it&quot; is this.<br>
1: Do you agree with what has happened with your guild in the past?<br>
2: If no, then why are you apart of that Guild?<br>
<br>
Many people could give a rats ass what guild you belong to. I do, and will hold people accountable for the actions of thier guild. Find me wrong find me right, no matter to me it is how I choose to play.<br>

Please send a tell to Teggo he is the leader of Defenders of Valour, (Provided that is the guild you are talking about though the spelling is slightly different from your post), he is interested in finding out whats going on with members of our guild.  Considering we have only 4 members of our guild high enough to be hanging out in Ssra we'd love to narrow it down.  We are a small tight knit group of folks who have been friends for years, if someone is causing you grief often enough for you to post about it give us a chance to figure out whats going on.<br>

Lastly, i think that even if you hate a guild, HATE, it doesn't make sense that you would not help one of their members that has not been rude to you directly just because you hate the tag next to his name. The fact that they are asses shouldn't drag you down to that lvl as well. After all, not everyone in infamous guilds needs to be educated. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ujableakl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jableakl</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local Resident</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(2/13/02 6:34:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=908.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What you do IS a reflection of what is next to your name</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;I think that officers are accountable for keeping a guild free of rude people.&quot;[/qoute]<br>

What if the guild officer is sending RL threats to other people. Hmmmm what do you do in this case? Also Biggins what does that say about the guild?<br>

"You would be afraid that I would twist off your head" is different than "I will twist off your head". To be considered a real thread, a person has to have both the intent, and the means to carry out that thread. Even if it was a RL threat, he didn't have the means.<br>
In other words, the argument wouldn't hold up in court. You guys took it as a RL threat just because you thought it would overshadow the lame ass roadblock tactics you tried on us.<br>
<br>
What about all those little EW kiddies spazzing out in shout and ooc when they lost the lotto? I'd bet my account that you guys wouldn't have used the "Guides can't do that; only GMs can" argument if you had won the roll.<br>
<br>
NOTE: This is not my attempt to resurrect that stupid thread that <b>EW</b> (cough, "...what does that say about the guild?") started. But, Cuth mentioned my name, so I come to me and my guild's defense. <p><FONT SIZE=+1><a href=http://casusbelli.tamu.edu/magelo.php?mid=13102><B>Biggins Black: Assassin</B></a></FONT><BR>

<br>
1) You have very strong stance on this so wanted to see if you applied this to youself equally. The answer is no. Biggins We always got along well in the past just running test sorry to see you failed through rationalization.<br>
<br>
2) As far as the Kael incident, ya a lot of poor behavior there on both sides there is no doubt. I would not deny that for one second. But in reality Gandien was making threats to people beyond what he put in the logs.<br>
<br>
Anyway Biggins you are still my favorite pullin in Sebilis<br>
<br>
Biggins tells the group, INC<br>
Biggins assasinates his Target (with a throwing dagger)<br>
Biggins tells the group, Nevermind<br>
Biggins tells the group, INC I found another mob<br>
<br>
Chin up bro. When you make a rather bold statement dont be shoked if someone tries to hold you to it bro.<br>
<br>

I was totally disgusted at that flame war. I was disgusted in Kael when it was happening, and I was disgusted when my guildmates even bothered responding to the thread about it here. Yes, I let them know about it, in private. In case you didn't notice, I didn't post under that thread.<br>
<br>
People get mad; people say things that they don't mean. That happens when you put 200 pounds of shit in a 50 pound sack. We can thank poor game design for it. I'm sure that our issue in Kael was a prime example of that.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying hold one act against someone and guildremove them. My post was directed at habitual offenders. I'm talking about people that consistantly lose their cool in guildchat/ooc/shout/whatever. I'm talking about people that constantly come to this board and make asses of themselves. The only one-time acts that I think should get someone removed is theft. Ninjalooting, scamming someone, something along that line. What would happen if you alienated every friend and loved one that ever said or did anything that made you angry? You'd be alone.<br>
<br>
I like about 90% of the members of Eternal Wrath. It's that other 10% of you that leave a sour taste in my mouth. You know who you are. The funny part is, most of the people that made a scene in ooc/shout in Kael that night were already part of the 10%. It's sad that 10% of you can all but completely destroy my respect for your guild. I don't know if my opinion is right or wrong. But, it's how I feel, so I'm sticking to it.<br>
<br>
Just the same, Gandien's act may have destroyed your opinion of Casus Belli. You are entitled to hate him all you like. That's the difference between the general public and family. You can completely hate any average Joe for a single act of dumbness. Will you completely hate a family member for a similar act? Gandien is family in this game; I support and defend him to the death.<br>
<br>
P.S. Cuthbert, you are part of the 90% <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><FONT SIZE=+1><a href=http://casusbelli.tamu.edu/magelo.php?mid=13102><B>Biggins Black: Assassin</B></a></FONT><BR>
