So, you are not cynic in your way of screaming &quot;hitler, Hitler, HITLER&quot; at me in post after post. Instead you are honest. You know what? That only makes it worse. <br>
<br>
If you disagree with my opinions, fine. You should have been able to debate in a sensible manner. Instead you let you personal fears take over you, and you go out on some wild ghost crusade. Take a long shower and then take a close look at your own posts. Maybe you'll realize how fucked up they are. You could just as well have quoted the book of revelations and point as some loose connection between me and the antichrist. And then kept babbling about that imaginary connection in post after post. <br>
<br>
The only connection between me and Hitler is that you personally consider both him and me to be evil, and that you somehow gotten it into your head that this feeling of yours is a important truth. That's why you can keep saying that my opinions are the same as Hitler's in spite of the fact that you agree that is not the case. That's how you can spit out sick stuff like that the results are the same, in spite of the fact that even you agree that they are not. It's all in your head, mister. <br>
<br>
History contain a lot of very interesting philosophers. Hitler is not one of them. Hitler was fucked up, period. Everyone know that, everyone agree with it, and that is also the only way his name is ever used. As a petty insult or as a scream of moralistic panic. When it come to debates, Hitler is nothing more and nothing less then the bogeyman. And you most likely know that allready, if you think about it. If someone spent his posts babbling about you being as bad as Hitler, would you be impressed? Do you think it would give you something to think about? Of course not.<br>
<br>
I am interested in discussing the philosophical and ethical issues. I have nothing against discussing my won or the other debaters personal feelings a bit further. However, I am not the least bit interested in your personal fears and how you take them out on me. I am not interested in if there might or might not be possible to imagine connections between me, Hitler, the devil, the Illuminati and the men in black. And if Usama Bin Ladin happen to have a opinion on abortion, please leave it out of this thread. I don't care to hear it.<br>
<br>
It's a really good thing that you admit (especially to yourself) that this is actually about your personal emotional reactions to my opinions. However, unless you can leave that mess behind (and take your bullshit back and leave it behind) I'm not interested in communicating with you. I don't know you, and I am most certainly not your therapist. I have no obligation to listen to this. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I:<br>

Biological life from conception, yes. But not a person.<br>

<br>
No matter what your &quot;defect&quot; given the proper surroundings you can excel and lead a life with a good standard of living.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
(Linebreak added by me.)<br>
<br>
I agree completely on both statements.<br>
The first part is what make me feel that abortion shouldn't have to be a moral problem. It's a blank slate that gets discarded, not a person that gets killed. Since you said earlier that you are not totally against abortions, I assume that we also share this view.<br>
<br>
The second part is the interesting one when it comes to our disagreement.<br>
<br>
We both believe that individuals have the same rights and value regardless of if they are crippled in one way or another or not. We also believe that it's possible to live a good or at least reasonably endurable life, almost regardless of how well the body and brain functions. You might be more optimistic in this later regard then I am, but if there is such a difference then it's irrelevant.<br>
<br>
However, I'm unsure if we both believe that it is preferable to not be crippled over being it. I do, adn I assume you do too. I think it's VERY preferable. Crippled people usually wish that they could walk or see or not have to suffer pain all the time, while I have no desire whatsoever to suffer any of those problems. Health seem to be very preferable indeed.<br>
<br>
We both agree that canceling a fetus is not like murdering a person. We both agree that it is preferable to not be crippled over being it.<br>
<br>
From here, our conclusions differ a bit. I think it's preferable if the clean slate you start out with don't have any major built in flaws. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

I must also disagree with you. I can only assume that you are one of those people of perfect health who never had a single flaw at the time of their birth.<br>
<br>
I'm sure that if you asked people who actually were born with defects that many of them would rather be alive than be denied that chance at all.<br>

<br>
Of course they prefer to be alive!<br>
They exist, and they prefer to continue to exist.<br>
<br>
Hey, there's a lot of things about the past I prefer...<br>
My mother didn't have a abortion, my father didn't use a condom, both of them actually MET each other once upon a time.<br>
<br>
If my father had stayed with his old wife, then I would most certainly not have existed.<br>
<br>
However, if he had stayed with her, it would NOT have been a crime against me, it would not have been something done against me in any way. I didn't exist yet.<br>
<br>
In the same way, YOUR existence is not a crime against the children your parents might have had instead of you if you hadn't been. <br>
<br>
Please see the difference between what DOES exist and what MIGHT exist.<br>
<br>
As for me having perfect health, yada yada...<br>
Currently my health is quite average. My eyes and my stamina are not as good as I would wish, but no big problem. I can't run a marathon, and If I was a cardriver then I would have to wear glasses to see the streetsigns from far enough distance, but that's about it. When I was eight years old I was sick for a year. Really bad diease, don't know what it's called in english. Took another year or two before I could walk normally, and a few more before I was fully recovered. Took a hell lot of work and pain.<br>
<br>
I never contemplated suicide, that would have been silly. Life is to precious for that. However, if I could have backed time 9 months or so and never got the disease...<br>
YES that would have been preferable. You got a problem with that? And no, I wouldn't want to go back in time to get rid of teh disease now. Cancelling 17 years of my life, and important years at that, just to get rid of a problem I got rid of over a decade ago anyway? How silly wouldn't THAT be?<br>
<br>
Similary, OF COURSE people who allready exist don't want to be aborted. If you did read my previous posts, maybe you saw the part about my friend in highschool.<br>

<br>
Can we agree that you are obviously emotionally involved in this topic? You posted something similar to that earlier in the thread. You then comment on trying to be only involved on an ethical standpoint and this detactched. I would put to you that you are not able to emotionally detach, and thus going to &quot;go off&quot; a bit like we all do on topics where we are highly invested in.<br>
<br>
Terhas has posted some similarities that he sees in your opinions and that of some other people. He's not screaming Nazi at all. He seems to be putting forth a different perspective. That perspective is not pretty at all, but it's no less valid than yours. It's all opinion. Your entire position would fall apart if you simply held the opinion that life begins at conception.<br>
<br>
Perhaps before you get all worked up again about something someone posts, you should shift your perspective a bit to see it from their point of view. If you truly care about an ethical discussion and not just forwarding your own opinions, it would seem a helpfull tool.<br>
<br>
I don't have a lot of involvement with this topic to be truthful. I'd never go through with an abortion decision willingly, but I would take on the full responsibility of that position. That is just a personal decision based on my belief system and ethics. I don't expect that to be the way the rest of the world see it.<br>

<br>
One of my <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> closest</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> friends has Cerebral Palsy(among other ailments. He's a truly great friend. I shudder to think of my life without his friendship.<br>
<br>
His mother was a drunk and his father a drug addict. From birth he has been wheelchair bound. He has incredibly poor coordination(putting on shoes and socks is about a 30 minute endeavor for him). To tie those shoes would be another 30 minutes so he wears mostly hightops(for support) With minimal lacing required and is simply not possible somedays. He appears &quot;retarded&quot; (descriptive and not meant to be a put down. When he talks about being misunderstood, he uses that word). He has a very large forhead, and his left eye does not track what he is looking at. His speaks very slowly and with some modal(mouth movement and tongue movement) difficulty. He learns left brain activities VERY slow(comparitively) and has difficulty understanding anything involving math or pure logic. He grew up in various homes of friends and other family from 14 years old on as his mostly single mother was not able to care for him.<br>
<br>
He leads his fullest possible life and we've spoken many times about his &quot;quality of life&quot;. He states, emphatically that he would never consider suicide or that he should not have been born.<br>
<br>
I spend an average of 15 hours a week with this friend seeing movies, eating a meal or BS'ing about books, films life the universe and everything. I hate to think of what I would have lost had he not been born. Had he been aborted (and he fits the profile that most of you in this thread have put forth as &quot;worthy of abortion&quot;) the many people's lives that this guy has touched would be far less for it.<br>
<br>
Since he's reading this thread, I want to say somethign to him. Thanks for being my buddy Dustin, my life has been enriched by yours.<br>

Yep, I'm emotionally involved. As you noticed, I mentioned that before without anyone pointing it out for me. HOWEVER, regardless of our individual emotional reactions, ethics as such is still a matter of logic and philosophy, not of emotional outbursts. We shoudl try our best to think clearly.<br>
<br>
As for Terhas, he have a lot of a lot of interesting points, and is obviously intelligent. That's why I get so angry when he throw the &quot;hitler&quot; bullshit into the mix and keep clinging onto it. <br>
<br>
As for your friend, I'm sure he's a great guy and make a lot of people happy. However, that's because of his personality, not because of his handicaps.  <p>Love, Edeina<br>

I'm not sure what the point of that statement is, my point was this:<br>
<br>
He would never had the chance to be this giving and caring person and would never had made my life(and the lives of others) better for his existence were his mother to have agreed with you and others in this thread that support your position.<br>
<br>
They were aware he would have serious functional disabilities, they were not &quot;responsible&quot; parents. They are still not able to care for themselves let alone a child, let alone a handicapped child. They indeed could not care for him and he wandered about some in life with a lot of uncertainty.<br>
<br>
I'm really only trying to provide that other perspective that I mentioned in my first post.<br>
<br>
I was not meaning to point out that you were emotionally charged as a bad thing. Passion and conviction is a great thing indeed. I was trying to point out that perhaps you are not able to discuss it without that emotion coloring your thoughts and that trying to step back from it might help a bit. None of that is a criticism, just an observation. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=40638>Swysh's Magelo Profile</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uasatrulifeaura.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Asatru Lifeaura</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local Resident</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/9/02 8:36:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1634.topic&index=123>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This thread is about disabilities, abortion and such.</span><hr size=1> Edeina<br>

Yep... you answered my question.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    My post was not for, or against abortion, or to call anyone a murderer, or to condone anything... merely to distinguish &quot; lump of tissue&quot; term.<br>
<br>
Abortion is a HARD choice, no matter what the circumstances...I am sure even the irresposible teenager sheds a tear at the thought of doing it, and actually doing it... but as you said, emotions and ethics are not the same thing, and her showing emotion towards that fetus, good or bad,doesnt make her choice, whatever it may be, wrong !<br>
<br>
As a woman, I can not point my finger at anyone for how they choose to proceed with a pregnancy... I know girls who have aborted and I wonder why? Then I have seen mothers screaming at the top of their lungs at infints in a grocery store, and wonder WHY?<br>
<br>
SO, right or wrong... who am I to judge. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I know how I &quot;choose&quot; to live, and thats all that matters! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Honestly one of the only reasons I continue to particapate in this thread is because I find merit in your replies on this subject. I value them primarily because I try to understand everyone around me. I find through understanding people you can learn more about the world around you. After all we as Human beings dominate the world, ( well actually water does <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  but then we are big sacks of water... ) so what better way to try and exsist in this world.<br>
<br>
I hope there are no hard feelings. I again apologize for any anger I may have caused. It was not my intention.<br>
<br>
Back to the thread:<br>
<br>
If we do not learn from our history we will continue to make the same mistakes. Hitler just happens to be the only person that I know of, in any detail, within the past 100years that took a stance on trying to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> purify</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the human race. Therefore I use him as an example. I did so knowing that their were extreme implacations by saying &quot;Hitler&quot;. I have attempted more than once to convince anyone who reads this and especially Edeina, my intentions were not to imply all that was Hitler and everything he ever did wrong. They were to draw similarities between the end results.<br>
<br>
This is terribly over simplified but here goes an anology:<br>
We are driving thru Montana, A state with few speedlimits. Both heading to the same destination<br>
I race thru at 100+ Mph.<br>
You drive at a safer speed lets say 55mph.<br>
End result we both arrive at our destination<br>
<br>
Now take the legalities  and right and wrong out of it ( sorry was the first thing that pop'd in my head ) and compare. Two methods same result. The first terribly reckless and extremely dangerous, the second much safer and controlled.<br>
<br>
Hitler wanted a perfect race. He felt the need to kill Millions of people because they were not to his standards of what someone should be. Therefore they were a burden upon the greater humanity and should be killed thus releaving the burden.<br>
<br>
Some feel it necessary to abort unborn children solely on the basis that they are defective by their standards. ( This is where I think things really get similiar. ) Why? From the reasons I have seen posted the &quot;why&quot; revolves directly around the burden on the parents, the child and those around them. Therefore by only the Mother's standards of normality and what she feels she can deal with as a burden and the possible horrid quality of living for the child, the child is aborted. Thus releaving the burden.( as law is written now the fathers have zero say, that is a whole nother topic though) <br>
<br>
To summarize:<br>
Hitler's method was reckless and dangerous and out right inhumane.<br>
A Mother's choice is safer, and isn't as broadly inhumane.<br>
End result is someone's life/potential life has been ended, because of the standards placed upon them by someone else in an effort to releave burden and make the world more &quot;normal&quot;.<br>
<br>
In this particular case I draw no line between life and potential of life, because either way they are living. In order for a mother to find out if their child is going to have birth defects the fetus must be into the first serious developmental stages of the gestation period, 2nd Tri-mester. ( atleast last I knew ) If you have gone so far as to get these tests done then the doctors can probably tell you the likelyhood of carrying the unborn child to full term.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> It is my opinion</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> that if a mother knows that a baby will be born if the gestation period is allowed to go full term. Then she knowling aborts the child <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> solely</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> over concerns about <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> possible</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> birth defects and the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> possible</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> burdens she and the unborn child may endure. Then she has committed one of the most selfish, self-righteous acts imanginable to myself. She has destroyed a life based on her perceptions of normal ( non-defective ) and based on possible burdens she and the child may endure.<br>
<br>
I say this for two primary reasons. First and foremost, these test are not 100 percent accurate. There is always a chance the child will be born with absolutely no adnomarlities. Secondly, if you havent figured it out yet, I do not define a living human being by the life experiences they have had. Once conception has occured there is a living human being that is forming. All of the genetics that will shape their form are hard at work, filling that form into what we recognize as a baby. To me it is more than just a &quot;lump of tissue&quot;. Just a lump of tissue would not evolve into a human child in 9 months. Maybe at the beginning stages it resembles a &quot;lump of tissue&quot; but there is much much more going on than even science fully understands.<br>
<br>
I tailored these comments as best I could to the original subject matter. Or atleast as I understood it, Abortion to avoid a Birth defected child. Abortion is not an easy thing to discuss. Their are so many issues I think one could spend a life time discussing them. This post has yet again more than filled 3 screens full so I will cut it off from here. <p>Latah,<BR>Terhas<BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=151667>My Gear!</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uterhasxa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TerhasXA</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local Resident</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/10/02 10:56:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1634.topic&index=128>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Abortion Solely for Birth Defects.</span><hr size=1> Hrmm Re-reading my post and I seem to sound terribly judgemental.

Am I the only one who finds such a statement to be incredibly insensitive among other things?  It is my hope that this reply is simply a trolling attempt to invoke a response and not what you actually believe.  Drooling little monster??  I am assuming you are not a parent.  And lets get one thing straight here - it is NOT the child who causes people pain - it is the situation that causes the pain.  To put the blame of a bad situation on an already defenseless child is just wrong.<br>
Besides you are basing quality of life for other people on what you see as your own quality of life - thus your definition is very subjective and biased.  But I do have a question for you?? We know what you feel should be done to children at or before birth - but what about those who develop disablities from medical conditions or accidents??  Want to kill them too?<br>

<br>
Can't speak for others in this thread, but I couldn't disagree more if I have interpreted this correctly. You're saying it's better to abort a pregnancy that may have birth defects than to have the baby? Just as I would not hold a person’s skin color against them as being preferable over another, I would not hold their handicaps against them as being less preferable.<br>
<br>
Perhaps if you had different life experiences with people with handicaps you would hold a different opinion? That is an honest question and goes to what I posted earlier about my friend. He is an excellent example of a good human being yet people that agree with your position would have aborted him.<br>
<br>
I am truly curious as to what that experience would have on your opinion? I concede that you may have had a good experience (or bad for that matter) with a handicapped person and it had no effect on your position. I am interested to read your take on that though.<br>
