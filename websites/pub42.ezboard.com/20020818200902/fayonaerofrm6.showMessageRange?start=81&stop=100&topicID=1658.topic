Our elderly are well taken care of, My Grandmother lives comfortably on Social Security and her numerous medical problems are taken care of by Medicare and other government elderly medical programs.<br>
<br>
The truth is that the European, Canadian and Australian medical systems result in people recieving sub standard medical care because good doctors don't get involved in cheap healthcare, they accept direct money from people who can afford healthcare that doesn't involve a rusty scalpel.  The rest of you poor shmucks stand in line and get shitty healthcare.<br>

It was a riot based on religion, and politics. The people that were killed in that riot I am positive did not attend with the motivation of &quot;Hey I think I will attend a football match today, fight, and then get my ass killed&quot;. What fun. Most of the riots that break out at those games are based on politics, national pride, and racism. Not just for fun.  <p>Simondavid

<br>
"Where people who are not able to show their AMEX and/or insurance card are sent out of the hospital again. I know that europian social system are not the best, but such things you wont find there."<br>
<br>
Utterly wrong.<br>
<br>
"Your election system? Which I, despite some information gathering and research, am still not able to grasp - it escapes me why people need to pick other people who vote for them (very simplified, but that it's to what it comes down) the president."<br>
<br>
Our election system is designed as a safeguard against people like that Le Pen freak.<br>
<br>
"Your educational system? Where poor people have no chance to get a better education, except they are awesome Quaterbacks. Again granted that europians educational systems have flaws in them, but at least they are affordable."<br>
<br>
As mentioned elsewhere, our education system is one of the best in the world.  Anyone who is willing to work hard will get a shot at college.  Europeans probably wouldn't make it since working hard is an alien concept to them.<br>
<br>
"so we got also a lot bad apples but I also may remind you that America had 10 years ago a racist war in LA (exaggerated) - I have yet to find something similar in Europe."<br>
<br>
Yeah, no racist wars in Europe.  Killing Jews doesn't count eh?<br>
<br>
"Your economy? This is a point, where I partialy aggree. The US economy is strong and flowing, but with the recent drawbacks (Worldcom, etc.) Europe came pretty close regarding the currency."<br>
<br>
Europe will never come close to the US.  The reason is that the majoirty of the European workforce is more worried about how much vacation they will get than how much work they will do.<br>
<br>
VibesJoker,<br>
<br>
"I think that every black man in your country will surely agree that all they do is riot to grab stuff and that it had nothing to do with 4 white policeman beating the shit out of a guy."<br>
<br>
Yep, 4 policemen did something stupid, and they paid the price for it.  Take a look in the news right now, a cop just got caught beating up a kid, he is going to burn for that too.<br>
<br>
"Must be that great country where there are like 80% black prisoners, but hey that has nothing to do with the US .. must be a black thing?"<br>
<br>
When people commit crimes, they go to jail.  Crimes rates tend to be related to culture.  Right now the inner city culture is pretty fucked up.  It will change over time, and everyone in America is concerned and working on it.  Compare that with the Europeans who would rather take a vacation than work on solving problems.<br>
<br>
"You say that because Afghanistan did not give OBL to the US you have the right to attack that country .. So you would agree that if a US citizens plants a bomb in another country they have the right to do the same?"<br>
<br>
You know as well as I do that is a stupid statement.  If a US Citizen committed acts of terrorism there is no way we would knowingly harbor them.  Wake up dumbass.<br>
<br>
"Every time it comes down to the we are allowed to do so .. but you are not .. kinda discussion."<br>
<br>
When Europe decides that it would like to work instead of laying around on its ass, then perhaps you can step forward and play with the big boys.<br>
<br>
"Very simple .. If you knew Bin Laden was in Washington, you know he was in an Area of lets say 3000 square miles .. would you bomb that 3000 miles .. ok you would first tell everyone to leave their homes and then bomb it"<br>
<br>
Bin Laden would be dead in the street.  The difference is that a good portion of the Afghan people sympathize with the enemy.  That means a few of them get to eat bombs.<br>
<br>
"The Koeweit thing .. Really ... I know Saddam is a freak .. but can you seriously without a doubt tell me that if there was no oil then the US would have done something?"<br>
<br>
We have played policeman in plenty of countries that didn't have oil involved.<br>
<br>
"They were offered a cut of the profits from the pipelines; 15 per cent was mentioned. A US official observed that, with the Caspian's oil and gas flowing, Afghanistan would become "like Saudi Arabia", an oil colony with no democracy and the legal persecution of women"<br>
<br>
It is too bad that the pipeline was never setup.  You don't understand what a pipeline will mean for that country.  When you tie the economy of two countries together, especially a small country to a large country, the large country starts to have more influence over the small country.  You ever notice that Saudi Arabia is now one of the more moderate middle eastern countries?  An American woman can actually walk around there without getting the shit beaten out of her on sight (in most cases).<br>
<br>
The key to turning a country like Afghanistan around is to boost the economy of that country, and to tie that economy to peace.  Once people get a shot at a peaceful life they are reluctant to blow themselves up in schools.<br>

<br>
I sure can't speak for all of Europe, but in the country I live in, is one of the more developed once regarding medical surgery and treatment. Actualy we had in the near past surgerys which where nowhere done yet - successfull.<br>
<br>
Besides that, it was Ralph who brought up that specific problems in medical treatment of elder persons exist - I take his words.<br>
<br>
I am sure you didn't read my response to Ralph or you wouldn't have brought up education again. Also about the election system, I am not sure if it is a system to protect you from people like Le Pen, as you say it, or to sponsor people with an huge lobby (of which you got enough in America) backup. As Ralph said, your system failed already once - can happen everytime again, since to my knowledge, nothing got changed in it.<br>
<br>
If you want to bring up Hitler and WW2 into the racism debate - so be it. But then explain me please, why american soldiers killed the indians - and if I may add, with an huge success rate.<br>
<br>
I don't think that you can compare what Hitler did (or the Americans with the Indians) with 'riots'. Both where wars to extinct an entire population. Bit out of scale if you ask me.<br>
<br>
You're plain simple wrong Abrahams when you say Europe will never come close to USA regarding economics - look at the $ &amp; € - we are already.<br>

Yes it has its flaws maybe if you come in with an earache your going to have to wait several hours to get helped but if you need care and you need it right away you will get it, if your problem can wait and won't jeapordize your health and the hospitals are busy then yes your going to have to wait.  <br>

<br>
Only from a friend who lived in Holland about two years ago (native there, moved away).  The truth of the matter was that if you wanted good medical treatment, you paid for it, otherwise you took your chances with shitty, underpaid doctors.<br>
<br>
"Actualy we had in the near past surgerys which where nowhere done yet - successfull"<br>
<br>
That has nothing to do with the medical treatment that the average guy on the street gets.<br>
<br>
"Besides that, it was Ralph who brought up that specific problems in medical treatment of elder persons exist - I take his words."<br>
<br>
You misread his words, he stated that it was difficult for elderly to pay for health insurance, since they were not working, so we created medicare and social security to take care of them.<br>
<br>
"But then explain me please, why american soldiers killed the indians - and if I may add, with an huge success rate."<br>
<br>
Because we were taking over their land.  That is often what happens when one people displaces another.  150 to 200 years ago things like that were fairly standard practice.  It should be noted that a good portion of those people who committed those attrocities were European, they had not learned what it means to be an American yet.<br>
<br>
"I don't think that you can compare what Hitler did (or the Americans with the Indians) "<br>
<br>
A critical difference should be noted about the Indians vs. the Jews.  We were displacing what we considered dangerous people from the land.  Hitler was killing jews because he didn't like them.  It wasn't about finding a new place to live.<br>
<br>
"I am sure you didn't read my response to Ralph or you wouldn't have brought up education again. Also about the election system"<br>
<br>
I probably missed it, lot of damn posts to read :P<br>
<br>
"You're plain simple wrong Abrahams when you say Europe will never come close to USA regarding economics - look at the $ & € - we are already."<br>
<br>
Currency value means nothing.  Your basic problem is that the European people have no work ethic.  Without a work ethic you will never come close to the United States.  <br>
<br>
If Europe continues to not support a military of any size, then you can come crowing that you caught up when the US dollar is at .20 to the Euro.  We make a lot of product in this country, and we spend a lot of money on things that Europe skimps on.   <p><img src = "http://www.concentric.net/~gandalfh/BixieSig.jpg" width = 199 height = 136>

The facts are that it is a fuckup and plenty of canadians come over the border and PAY for decent healthcare that doesn't involve a 6 hour wait.<br>

<br>
Anyhow, you keep on standing in line to get your earache taken care of all the while bagging in the United States healthcare system.  Your smarter brethren will take a ride across the border and get it taken care of in 30 minutes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uabrahamdaoc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Abraham DAOC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local Resident</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/10/02 7:26:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1658.topic&index=93>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Now Ytrok</span><hr size=1> "bagging in" > "bagging on"<br>

<br>
Some love it, some hate it. You can find flaws with both.<br>
<br>
Personally, I am glad we have the system we have. <br>
<br>
A perfect example was last Wednesday.<br>
<br>
I woke up with my left eye swollen. When I got to the office, I picekd up the phone, dialed my eye doctor and made an appointment. 20 mins after I hung up the phone, I left the for the 10 min drive to his office. 15 mins in the waiting room and I was examined and diagnosed. Paid the bill, left, and was back at the office in another 10 mins.<br>
<br>
Total time for treatment - less than an hour portal to portal.<br>
Total cost - 60 bucks (haven't met my deducatble yet this year ;p )<br>
<br>
The system works for me.<br>
<br>
The biggest downsides I see cited for a system like you find in Canada are the waiting times for no life threatening afflictions and the higher taxes needed to pay for the system.<br>
<br>
The downside for what we have in the US - increased cost when you need to use it.<br>
<br>
For me (I see a doctor maybe 2-3 times a year), the tax and time savings are worth it. <br>
<br>
It just seems that a public healthcare system would encourage folks to run to a doctor for every hangnail they might get. Why not? It's free.<br>
<br>
Also, some doctors tend to move south of the border since they can make more money here. <br>
<br>
I'll stick with what we have, but if you are happy with how yours is, more power to you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The main reason I had come back to this thread was because the LA riots were being named and racism.<br>
<br>
Alot of the Rodney King incident was left unsaid by the media and help fuel peoples ire.<br>
<br>
Here's a run down...<br>
<br>
There was a pursuit on the Foothill Freeway. The guy tried to get away. When he finally stopped, he got out of the car and tried to take on the whole force.<br>
<br>
March 1991: An amateur videotape shows LAPD officers clubbing and kicking Rodney King, who is black. <br>
<br>
April 1992: A jury acquits three of the officers involved in the beating. There were no black jurors. <br>
<br>
April 1992: The verdict sparks riots, destroying much of South Central LA. Fifty-four people are dead, over 2,000 are injured. The estimated damage totals $900 million. <br>
<br>
During the riots, another brutal attack is captured on tape and televised. Reginald Denny, a white truck driver, is severely beaten by rioters. <br>
<br>
Now....<br>
<br>
Different versions of the tape: Most of America saw an edited version of the amateur videotape. Jurors in the officers' trial saw an additional 13 seconds, in which King charged the officers. This version fueled the jurors' decision to acquit. <br>
<br>
KTLA people gave the tape unedited to the police department because they wanted to make sure that it was authentic, and the police confirmed it. And then they put on in their newscast 68 seconds of this 81 seconds. The first 3 seconds are critical because they show Mr. King lunging in the direction of Officer Laurence Powell, who then responds with this baton blow. <br>
<br>
It's brutal in any version, but the first three seconds that were omitted by the television station are a window into all of the things that have happened before the videotape begins. So what the viewer is seeing is a partial record of a partial record. [The King incident began with a 7.8 mile car chase conducted by California Highway Patrol officers, one of whom drew a gun on King before the LAPD took over.] <br>
<br>
Rodney King had done all of these things before the videotape - He'd resisted the officers, he'd charged the officers, he'd thrown four officers off his back, he'd been shot twice with a stun gun, which keeps most people down. 50,000 volts of electricity each time, it didn't keep him down. This was a case where a great effort was made to take Rodney King into custody without hurting him, believe it or not. <br>
<br>
Gotta love when the media prechews the news and fuels the fire.<br>

Abrahams, with a statement like this<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It should be noted that a good portion of those people who committed those attrocities were European, they had not learned what it means to be an American yet.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
you lost any credibility in my eyes. Telling me you killed Indians because you where in need of their land - I could accept this one. But saying it where Europs who killed them because they didn't learn how to behave as Americans .. mmkay.<br>

<br>
Abaraham - I like you, your as patriotic as i am. And continue to make fair points (good ones too) for your side of the argument.  However you always seem to finish your posts off with something rude and unnecessary.  Bashing another country or calling Canada a Shithole for instance.  I mean come on, i know an American guy from my college who moved only 20 miles from where i live in england.  When i asked why he left America, his exact words were... &quot;Because it's a Shithole man&quot;  <br>
<br>
America is not a Shithole, Canada is not a shithole.  Europe is not a Shithole.  They are all just different lumps of rock on the same globe.  <br>
<br>
Aulora - Wow great post, couldn't have said it better myself.  There is no such thing as a &quot;best&quot; country and there never will be (never was for that matter) Had any one of you americans been born in a European country you would be on the other side of the argument. It's called Patriocism and in my opinion is very healthy (until people take it to the extreme)<br>
<br>
Every country has it's faults... Yes America too.. Yes my country England has them too. We all have them. Just as we all have things about our countries to be proud of.  But... theres no sense in pointing out time and time again another countries faults, without acknowledging your own too. (This is definately not directed just at Americans but at some of the European posters here also... it works both ways)<br>
<br>
Half my family lives in America, the other half in England.  When either half visits the other all we do is complain about how bad things are where we live.  Yes the Americans are complaining about how bad it is in America to the british side of the family...and Vice versa.<br>
<br>
<br>
OooOo while i am at it... Another thing for you Abraham,  you continually mention that Europeans don't like to work. Come on man, you really cant judge a whole continent on a couple of bad experiences with some European branches of your company.  Theres plenty of bad experiences people have with americans too. I for one dont judge a country...let alone a continent on the behavious of a few of it's citizens.<br>
<br>
Anyways... i think it's about time i logged in and played some EQ.  I'll see all you cousins of mine from accross the pond in game.<br>
<br>
BTW... I hate Tea, i don't ride a horse, i sure as hell don't say toodle pip.  Thanks US Media :-)<br>
