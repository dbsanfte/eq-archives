The raw fury still filled me, but instead of distracting me or forcing me into actions that were not appropriate, it led me down the path I should have taken before now.  The only thing that bothered me was the memory of that aging cavalier and the look of near-recognition on his face.  Another concern for another time.<br>
<br>
I had more important things to do.<br>
<br>
Vanlaan would be annoyed, I thought to myself, but it would be the last time.  It was time to show him that, despite my youth (as the Teir'dal measure such things) I was an adult, that I had earned my place by his side, and that I could be trusted to follow The Father's path.<br>
<br>
I slunk through the Commonlands until I reached the wall near the gates in western Freeport.  Using the evening shadows to hide my dark-skinned form, I felt carefully for the loose stone that would gain me access to the maze of sewers beneath the city.  Closing it carefully, I listened to make certain none had notices, and then made my stealthy way...<br>
<br>
Home.<br>
<br>
Neriak was the Holy City, but the decrepid houses and stinking sewers were my true home.  The Dismal Rage, where I had served, where I had attempted to lead, and, ultimately, where I had realised that I had failed in my Purpose.  That was why I had convinced Vanlaan that I was ready to help him release his sister from her tomb beneath North Freeport.  That was why I had allowed our presence to be noticed.  That was why I had allowed myself to be captured; because I longed for death.<br>
<br>
I had failed Innoruuk then, and I had failed myself.  I would not fail Him again.<br>
<br>
Although distrustful of me in my current form, my former allies were still willing to trade assistance for coin.  I purchased bandages and large clothes, large enough to hide myself.  A bloodstained robe finished the ensemble; innapropriate for a Champion of the Father to wear, but appropriate for my needs.  Several platinum coins passed hands before the house enchanter was willing to obscure my form; I knew he could not disguise me completely, but through his magic I would be... less noticable.<br>
<br>
Back through the sewers I went, until I was almost back to the doorway to the West Gates.  There, I pulled two small piles of bone chips and tossed them into a mystic symbol.  As I chanted the necromantic spell, they attracted the bones of the dead from nearby and formed into a skeleton.  &quot;Pet, guard here,&quot; I whispered, and winced as, in a sepulchral voice, it hissed &quot;As you command, oh great one&quot; in far too loud a voice.<br>
<br>
The ale I had already drank helped add to my obscuring, as none wished to be near the filthy beggar.  Muttering to myself as I went, I watched alertly through the hood of my cloak for any sign of the one I sought.<br>
<br>
Finally, in the Militia House, I found him.  &quot;Masher,&quot; I said, slurring my voice, &quot;tank the Marsh I found you.  Truth is Good, yeshir, Truth ish Good.&quot;<br>
<br>
His eyes widened.  &quot;A messenger?&quot; he whispered.  &quot;Be quiet.  Have you a message for me?&quot;<br>
<br>
I nodded enthusiastically, and handed him a dirty note.  On it, the wax seal of House Dushire, the leader of the Paladins of Marr.  Naturally, as his daughter, I had several of those house seals hidden in various places around Norrath - you never know when being able to deliver an official message would come in handy.  Naturally, I also knew exactly what the note said - &quot;Follow this servant of the Church to the West Gate.  She will bring you to someone who can enlighten us on the Dismal Rage's activities.&quot;<br>
<br>
Alayle, the paladin - for such he was, despite his pretense; a spy for the Marrs, leaking information of the Militia's activities.  I had known him as a child, before I had turned to Innoruuk.  He had been crafty but loyal then, and I knew he would be used for this purpose.<br>
<br>
&quot;Commander,&quot; he shouted, &quot;this... thing was allowed into the Hall.  I'll be taking it out the gates, where it belongs.&quot;  The commander nodded, not even giving a glance to the soldier.  Grabbing me by the shoulder, he whispered, &quot;Act like I'm forcing you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Getsher handsh off me, you bashterd!&quot; I shouted, loud enough to get everyone's attention.  When the paladin tried to cover my mouth, I bit him.  In a moment, his blade was at my throat.  &quot;Too convincing,&quot; he spat.  &quot;We're both on the same side.&quot;<br>
<br>
Under my bandages, I smiled.<br>
<br>
We made our way to the wall where my pet lay in wait.  &quot;Alright, he whispered, &quot;now what?&quot;<br>
<br>
I smiled, and with a gentle touch, sent all my hatred coursing through his body.<br>
<br>
I pulled images from the recesses of my mind, and used them to focus Innoruuk's power into the paladin.  My mother, telling me that I could never be a paladin like my father.  My teachers, refusing to let me train with weaponry, telling me that I would be a healer and nothing more.  My blood-father, preaching about Free Will, yet denying me access to what he termed &quot;forbidden lore&quot;.  Pietro Zarn, scoffing at me and calling me a pitiful worm for trying to follow The Father's will.  Loath as I am to admit it, I even focused on the fury I felt at Grand Inquisitor Val'khan, who, when I was on trial, made no appearance.<br>
<br>
And, of course, formost in my rage was the face of Aravs, the one fully responsible for my becoming Spurned.<br>
<br>
The paladin writhed in the agony of my touch like a man on fire.  With Innoruuk's True Blessing spent for the moment, I shouted, &quot;Pet!  Attack him now!&quot; as I drew out my Bone Bladed Claymore.  Confused by his pain, the paladin screamed in terror as my skeletal minion leapt from the shadows at him, laughing with the madness of death and raking at him with his dirty bony claws.  As the paladin desperately fended off my pet's attack, I used my other gifts to peel away slices of his soul like an onion and used them to lend me strength.  When the spy's agony had gone on enough to entertain me, I finally entered the fray, slashing viciously with my massive sword.  The paladin finally found the strength to shatter the fragile bonds that held my pet together, but could not stand against me.  He fell to the ground, exausted.  &quot;I yield!&quot; he whispered.  &quot;Do what you will, but let me live!&quot;<br>
<br>
A young warrior, seeing the fight, shouted at me.  &quot;Hey!  Stop that!&quot;  Angrily, I pulled back my hood and let the obscuring fade.  Faced with my hate-filled visage, the youngster fled.<br>
<br>
I kneeled before the paladin.  &quot;Do you know me?&quot; I hissed.  He stared at me, trying to focus through his agony.  I could smell the bitter tang of blood as it coursed into the sand below.  When he took too long to answer, I grabbed him by the hair and shouted, &quot;DO YOU RECOGNISE ME?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aedare... Aedare Dushire...  You're Aedare Dushire!  You're the daughter of the High Paladin!&quot;  The words came out in a confused, horrified rush.<br>
<br>
I smiled.  &quot;And do you know what I am?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're the one who turned from the Marrs to follow Innoruuk... Aedare the Traitor!  Aedare the Damned!&quot;<br>
<br>
My smile widened.  It was good to be remembered.  &quot;Then tell your precious Marrs that someday... I'm coming for them.&quot;  Tossing him to the ground, I weilded my claymore like an axe, and severed his head.<br>
<br>
Searching through his belongings, I found a few coins, but most importantly, the paladin's Testament of Truth, his most precious posession and the proof I needed to show the head of the militia that I had killed a traitor.  Using my finger as a pen, I wrote &quot;Thus to Marr worshippers&quot; in the Paladin's blood on the wall.  Then, wrapping the head carefully, I made my way to my true home - to Neriak.<br>
<br>
Spurned I might be... but I served the Father.  And soon, all Neriak would know that I was His champion.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p>Innoruuk Guides My Path,

<br>
She often did, 'those sort of jobs', for others, tasks that would normally not be undertaken, but that many were willing to pay quite handsomely for.<br>
<br>
She was an enchanter, and found Neriak a damp and dank place, full of stuffy conceited figure heads that didn't seem to care about anything other than their own position amongst themselves.<br>
<br>
Most cities seemed to be this way.<br>
<br>
Iteria, would seek out this new job, this Aedare person. Something about a cataloguing position, and reporting back to for acknowledgement.<br>
<br>
She had traversed through the commons, and used her magics to find a tracker, to locate Aedare.<br>
<br>
When she had reached within radius of the target, she had paid the tracker for his services with a knife in the neck. Iteria liked clean jobs. No sense, in anyone else knowing about her business. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uaedare.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aedare</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/10/01 3:26:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://dntsvara.tripod.com/aedarepic.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Aedare's Departure...</span><hr size=1> Passing through the Commonlands, I stopped at the Plague Village near the borders of Neriak.  It was a familiar place to me, as since our rejection by the Spires, Vanlaan and I had utilized it as a base of operations - a home, in far too many cases.<br>
<br>
I had arranged for a messenger, well in advance.  The question stood whether or not the messenger was trustworthy.<br>
<br>
When the robed dark elf slipped out from the shadows before me, I knew that he had been.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Iteria.&quot;<br>
<br>
No fawning respect, nothing but a professional attitude.  Not appropriate for a true follower of the Father, which meant she was exactly what I wanted.<br>
<br>
&quot;And you are an enchantress?&quot;<br>
<br>
She simply nodded.  Her being of the Spurned made her suit my cause.  But what had she turned away from?  Our people?  Or Our Father?  Little enough matter; if my plans went well, I would find out easily enough.<br>
<br>
&quot;You may care little for this, but listen anyway.  I represent the Church of the Firstborn.  As you probably know, the Firstborn and the Spires have become divided over how Neriak society should be run.  We should all be one people, following our Father's call.  Instead, we are a race of self-serving creatures who give no thought to His Glory when it does not serve us.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do I wish this to change?  Yes.  Is this why I have called you?  No.  The Spires has named one Spurned who does not deserve it.  I can be Spurned, for I was born human...&quot;<br>
<br>
She tried to hide her shock and disgust.  She failed.  Again, of little consequence.<br>
<br>
&quot;As I was saying, I can be Spurned, but Vanlaan cannot.  He is a true follower of the Will and the Way, and is too fragile to not feel that he is firmly connected to his home.  I seek to have the Spires renounce their statements about him.  To do so, I need to impress them, and my fellow dark elves, into ignoring the shouts of one of their members.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's where you come in.  I need to become... bigger than I am.  I need to become something of a legend, someone that the Dark Elves see as being the direct avatar of Innoruuk.&quot;  She laughed at that, and I shrugged.  &quot;Blasphemy, perhaps.  But if you can write in the style of the Old Books, perhaps we can pull this off.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And the payment?&quot;<br>
<br>
I reached under a loose board and brought out a shimmering wooden staff.  In the torchlight outside the house, runes glittered.  &quot;This... is a runed totem staff, an old weapon of Vanlaan's.  He was keeping it in case we needed a bargaining posture at some point.  It is yours, as is a full share of the treasure we may find on our explorations of Norrath.  After all, for someone who turned from Neriak's ways to learn, there must be little that is more valuable to you than a chance to increase your learning, yes?&quot;<br>
<br>
I could see the greed in her eyes, but I sat back to hear her response. <p>Innoruuk Guides My Path,

the Enchantress:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
And so it came to pass that Aedare Truedark, Champion of Innoruuk, did slay one of The Father's Hated Enemies near the gate of the Marr's City, within sight of one of the Marr's Children.<br>
<br>
And lo, having slain this most unworthy foe, Aedare removed his head from his body, and bore it from Freeport through the Commonlands, and into the Father's Beloved forest.  Her actions angered the souls of the Hated Others, and one of them rose from the dead to do battle with her.  But, upon seeing the Most Holy Hatred in her eyes, it bowed under her and offered its weapon for her use.  And Aedare nodded,<br>
for it was good in the Father's sight.<br>
<br>
With the head of the Hated One in one hand and the Fallen One's weapon in the Other, Aedare crossed into Neriak, and all eyes were upon her.  Many followed her past the Third Gate, and many watched as she stood proudly before the walls of the Spires.  And those within the Spires cowered in fear, for Innoruuk's Hand was upon her, and Innoruuk's Hatred burned in her eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hear me, oh Faithful!&quot; Aedare cried, and those in the Spires could not help but listen.  &quot;I hold in my hand the head of Our Enemy's Faithful, which I give to you in honor.&quot;  <br>
<br>
But none stirred within the Spires. And thus did Aedare take up the spear from the Fallen One, and thrust it into the ground with all her might; and though the ground before the spires was made of purest marble, and though the blade of the spear was covered with rust, it pierced through the ground with such force that thirteen of the strongest men could not pull it out.  And upon that spear she placed the head of the Hated Paladin of Marr.  But still none stirred.<br>
<br>
&quot;Still you do not answer my plea,&quot; Aedare called out once more.  &quot;I hold in my hand that Hated One's Testimony of Truth, the sum of his faith.  In Innoruuk's Holy Fires, I destroy this testament to do honor to the Father.&quot;  But still none stirred.  And with the torches that stood before the Spires, Aedare set the Testimony aflame; and as it burned, those around could hear the sounds of screaming, as though the Marrs Themselves cried out in pain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Most honored lords,&quot; cried Most Holy Aedare, &quot;I have done battle with the enemy in Innoruuk's Name.  And to you I bring the trophies of this battle.  Does this action not deserve a moment of your time?&quot;<br>
<br>
But one who hid his visage from the Father with a mask did step on the battlements of the Spires, and speak thusly to Aedare. &quot;Thirteen enemies of the Father may you kill, and thirteen times thirteen, but the Spires will not listen.  For I have turned them from their True Path, and they shall not follow the Will and the Way.&quot;  <br>
<br>
And with laughter, that one turned away, but Aedare knew from his voice that this was Aravs, who had turned from the Father's Teachings and had been seen in the company of the Hated Others for many turns of the moon.  And Aedare fell to her knees, and wept that such a noble force should be turned away from the Father.<br>
<br>
But her Hatred was strong, and so was her resolve. &quot;If thirteen will not suffice, and thirteen times thirteen still not be enough, then shall I slay thirteen times those.  The trees of Norrath will feast on the blood of His Enemies, and the Father will rule those whom He allows me to leave alive.  Until the Spires hears my plea, and Hated Aravs be torn from those battlements, let none who dwell in the light rest easy, for Aedare, the blade of Most Holy L'vanon brings His Most Holy Hatred to them all!&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=12.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=12.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=3><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=12.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.threadControl?topicID=12.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=12.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=12.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm14">Guilds<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm13">NWN & Morrowind<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Trash Bin<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Staff Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10>Roleplaying & GM Events</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
