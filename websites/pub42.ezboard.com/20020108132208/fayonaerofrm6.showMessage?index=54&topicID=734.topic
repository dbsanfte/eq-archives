<br>
When epics first came out, there were three categories of epics for Vision.  Those we had the power to do (like Shaman), those we had the power to do, but NEVER saw a spawn for (Wizard), and those we probably didn't have the power for (Necro).<br>
<br>
If you'll recall, early on, a number of the drops came from Cazic and Innoruuk themselves.  The necro epic took one from each.  It was, for example, out of reach of Vision (at the time).<br>
<br>
Fast forward to a quick look at Vision epics basicly show that everyone who wants one, isn't new, doesn't have a significant bottleneck (Warriors), or isn't a part-time player has one.  (Sure, we have people without - they're either in a large class where they're waiting their turn - PATIENTLY, or their epic simply isn't obtainable by us in large quantities.)<br>
<br>
All-in-all, about half of our &quot;regular&quot; players have epic weapons.<br>
<br>
We have players in Vision now that probably won't get an epic in the forseeable future because of the bottleneck and competition for rare spawns (Warrior, and to a lesser extent Enchanter).  ...and while I'd understand if they left Vision for a quicker mobalizing guild, or one going to VP regularly for green scales, I'd still be hurt deep down inside.<br>
<br>
I had to chant over and over again - stop worring about your epic weapons.  In time they'll come.  Those people who stayed and were patient have their epic weapons (if they took time to prepare for them, and actually wanted 'em).<br>
<br>
So, I say to all of you.  Good things come to those who wait. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4868>Palimax Sceleris</a>,

The druid epic is laughably easy.  One uber mob in the whole list.  I assisted 2 times on VSR, both times we had less that 12 people there.

It could be worse.  You could be in Vision, and you'd have to get your white scales from Gorenaire - who when we killed last - no less than three guilds asked us in the first minute if we'd want to sell the white scale.<br>

I would like to direct your attention to Allamar Zutherion, Officer of, and Main Tank of Vision.  When any item is received for the guild, we perform a simple check.  Is this item better than what Allamar has?  If so, it goes to Allamar.<br>

I agree.  If no one else in the guild has better armor then it should goto the main tank.  But, if the guild is not raiding the item you are after and will not support a requested raid on the mob that drops the item, because of some thought up level restriction, what then.  Also, if the Main tank and pretty much all of the other HC members are decked out in Dorf Velious armor, the rest running around in planar gear, then decide that, despite the fact that velious armor is no drop and will be destroyed to make room for other velious armors, the armor coming from ToV should go once again to the uber characters, instead of to those that put the uber characters in Dorf armor, what is a person to do?  <br>
<br>
I am not objecting but stating my views.  I repost to those people whom I see a response from, to clarify.  Because this seems to have touched on a subject that has been around a while, yet never voiced till now.  I think the upper echelon on this server, I realise this does not pertain to all, need to stop and think about how they got where they got and who helped them get there.  It's fairly selfish do destroy no drop armor, when the good of the guild should dictate that other people be better armored so they are not dieing off in support of these same people in future raids on tougher mobs.  This, directly spins into bardic and any other support class epic, where not only the individual, but anyone groupped with the individual, are excelled.  I think someone said it best, though I think the order is reversed.  Bardic epic is one of the best out there.  Only cleric epic, and possibly chanter but I would say chanter and bard epic are the same for the direct effect, should take precedence.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/upalimaxsceleris.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Palimax Sceleris</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/20/01 9:59:34 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: They said give up your Epic.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Also, if the Main tank and pretty much all of the other HC members are decked out in Dorf Velious armor, the rest running around in planar gear, then decide that, despite the fact that velious armor is no drop and will be destroyed to make room for other velious armors, the armor coming from ToV should go once again to the uber characters, instead of to those that put the uber characters in Dorf armor, what is a person to do? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Not only is the situation you describe exactly what happened with Allamar (he got PoG/Thurg and then got Skyshrine), but all of our other plate classes gave up drops to the warriors (our other active Warlords - Taygon, Menendi, Starslayer) so we could have the redundancy we needed.  We *needed* Allamar to have PoG/Thurg gear to be an efficient main tank in Temple of Veeshan.<br>
<br>
Our clerics have multiple Skyshrine quested breastplates, as do other plate classes now, however.  In time, all good things came to those who waited.<br>
<br>
Bards are special.  There aren't nearly enough to go around.  We try to treat ours pretty well, all things considered.<br>

As a guild priority for weapons, you *need* Cleric Epics.  They're mandatory.  I mean, it's night and day the difference between the haves and the have-nots on these things.  Shissar takes a HUGE toll off the shoulders of the Enchanters.  After that, and the warlord, we're all just along to do extra damage to mobs, so from a guild's priorites, you then start trying to complete Rogue/Monk/Ranger epics if they can't obtain better weapons in ST or NToV. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4868>Palimax Sceleris</a>,

Simply because I am the one that is the longest time member, because I have spent several times more time and effort in this guild then anyone else, because I organise everything, hold everything together and because I have the most online time. <br>
<br>
If your leader doesn't or didn't do those things, then no, he doesn't 'deserve' the epic the most.<br>
<br>
This is all considering an above statement that you can 'deserve' an epic. Which is IMO not a must. The 'deserve' an epic thingie is a very sensitive topic. Sorry for not having meniotned that. I should have written: If we consider effort, time in the guild and online time as the important things for deserving an epic, then...<br>
<br>
Still, my general statement counts. Making or forcing my epic makes no sense and doesn't really help the guild, so I forgot about it until one lucky day I may be able to do so becasue of an accident or so...<br>

Note I am not an officer or anything, this is just my opinion.  I'm sure I'm going to regret this, but I kinda have to comment :-)<br>
<br>
1. Vallis didn't tell you to give up on your epic - we simply said that we couldn't help you kill Vox and we're not strong enough to kill Gore yet.<br>
<br>
2. Vallis didn't badger you to level up - but on the other hand we occasionally have some raids that are 55+ only.  I don't think you were right to complain about this.  If you want to attend all raids, you will need to level up - your choice.<br>
<br>
3. Vallis never said that epics go only to 55+, however most large epic raids are either for (a) high levels who have given long time service to the guild, or (b) lower levels who are just one or two steps away.  You do not fit either category.<br>
<br>
4. ToV armour usually goes to 55+ people for a reason.  Those people regularly show up to Hate/Fear raids to help lower levels farm planes armour, diamonds/BDs for resist gear, etc.  They do so without much expectation of loot since they usually have planes armour already or better.  They show up to help the lower levels get good armour - it is simply common courtesy for the lower levels to help the higher levels upgrade their armour in ToV.<br>
<br>
Like I said before, I totally support your decision to stay 52 and lead Vox raids... but Vallis can't help you and I can't help you since I'm 55 and most of Vallis are over 52.  If you had been patient and collected all those other pieces you need, we might be strong enough to kill Gore by the time you needed the scale.<br>
<br>
I was sorry to see you leave Beniel because you are a good bard and we could sure use your strength.  But I think you were putting your epic before the good of the guild, and that's not right.<br>

Crydee's right, that in Vision, it's basicly up to your class leader who next from your class gets the assistance of the guild in doing your epic.  The class leaders work with the officers to keep the overall epic-rate fair, steady, and paced so that it doesn't contribute to the overall burnout rate in the guild.<br>
<br>
For example, Selan (our Shaman CL) picks the next shaman in line for an epic - and in the case of our Shaman it's a matter of having done the footwork, being in the right place at the right time, and then, in the case of ties, senority and participation.  Back when every shaman was tied (with no part of their epic done), our two most senior, participating, high-level Shaman, Cantra and Vaxumgax got their spears -- long before we were able to &quot;churn out&quot; Shaman epics.<br>
<br>
Obviously this plan works for some classes better than others.  100% of our Rogues, 100% of our Monks, 100% of our Rangers (at least Epic #1), 75% of our Druids, and 66% of our Wizards and Clerics (who play more than a day or two a week) have have epic weapons.  It's easy to be the &quot;next&quot; Druid when your class can churn them out.  It's not so easy to be the next Warrior (7%) sometimes.  It's especially not easy to be the 10th warrior on a list like that.<br>
<br>
The CLs and officers have an epic barometer of sorts.  Has the guild done too many recently?  Have we recruited monks and gone running around the world for them?  Normally the epic-light is green, but sometimes we put up the caution flag and keep epic raids to a minimum.<br>
<br>
Oh well, not something *super*-related to the topic at hand, but a look at the epic-handling-plan from a &quot;moderately powerful&quot; guild. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4868>Palimax Sceleris</a>,

I suppose in closed forum, where I cannot get the proof of what was said anymore, that Lyrik did not say exactly this.<br>
<br>
**QUOTE**<br>
2. Vallis didn't badger you to level up - but on the other hand we occasionally have some raids that are 55+ only. I don't think you were right to complain about this. If you want to attend all raids, you will need to level up - your choice.<br>
<br>
In the same thread, post after post of just get level 55.  Total bullshit.<br>
<br>
**Quote**<br>
3. Vallis never said that epics go only to 55+, however most large epic raids are either for (a) high levels who have given long time service to the guild, or (b) lower levels who are just one or two steps away. You do not fit either category.<br>

This was the same checklist I had posted in Vallis Bard section for everyone to see.  I would say 80% to 85% is checked off now wouldn't you and done on my own initiative.  How many of the mobs do you see there that are required, that I could solo or even single group.  Maybe eldrig but traditional thinking calls for 2 groups.  Other than that, not a damn one of them is less than a 3 group party.<br>
<br>
**QUOTE**<br>
Like I said before, I totally support your decision to stay 52 and lead Vox raids... but Vallis can't help you and I can't help you since I'm 55 and most of Vallis are over 52. If you had been patient and collected all those other pieces you need, we might be strong enough to kill Gore by the time you needed the scale.<br>
<br>
I agree that the upper echelon of people could not directly take upon themselves to attack Vox.  However, upper level buffs, in exchange for the xp and loot that would be gotten clearing the zone to vox, would have been more than enough.  I have studied up on what is needed, level 48 to 52 characters, 18 minimum, 3 chanters, 3 clerics, a 52 warrior as MA, and bards(best if there is one per group but the caster group is the group that does without if needed due to the fact that they are not directly assaulted by aoe for at least half the fight if done correctly).  I have also read in thread a massing of bards palis and clerics can drop the bitch quick.  Bards to keep the palis safe, palis to stun the hell out of her, and clerics to keep em all alive.<br>
<br>
**QUOTE**<br>
4. ToV armour usually goes to 55+ people for a reason. Those people regularly show up to Hate/Fear raids to help lower levels farm planes armour, diamonds/BDs for resist gear, etc. They do so without much expectation of loot since they usually have planes armour already or better. They show up to help the lower levels get good armour - it is simply common courtesy for the lower levels to help the higher levels upgrade their armour in ToV.<br>
<br>
First off, guild policy on BD/D gear was 55+ first, if there was any left over, then the rest would be decided on a need basis.  Melee getting priority.  The diamond gear I have, I bought and paid for myself, just like I paid for one of the failed attempts on chardok, 1.5kp out of my own pocket.  The BD bracelet I was allowed to use, is now back in guild hands, because I was honorable enough, even after leaving, to return guild property.  Second, I didn't ask for this personally and had I not been there as stated before the gear would have rotted.  And since I was one of the first true main bards in this guild, I am sure more than enough of this stuff went to rot, again as stated before.  I can get planar armor on my own at any given time on any given day where a guild is there raiding.  All that is required is be there.  Most let this stuff rot.  However, I did put time into farming ToV and Kael for the upper levels.  I did put time into assisting  others with their oh so important epics.  All I asked was for one thing.  HC chose thier position.  Again I state the old axiom.<br>
<br>
IF IT LOOKS LIKE IT, SMELLS LIKE IT, TASTES LIKE IT, then IT MUST BE IT.<br>
<br>
Looks to me like upper level characters in this guild are not gracious of the assistance they have been given.  Looks to me like HC wants the guild to outfit them in the best gear possible, while the lower level people suffer with planar gear.  Which any class can get, by just being there.  I think the evidence shows in the fact that I do have Hate BP, Boots, arms, and gaunts, and passed on legs, gaunts, and Kelin's Seven Stringed Lute to a fellow up and coming bard, that i was there, on multiple days.  The thanks I got for being so kind as to show up to scheduled events, unlike another person who chose to patronize me in the thread, who now plays DAoC, and who has not been seen for over two months, is to get the shaft.  To be told no, regardless of what I have done, I am not 55+ and therefore guild support is denied.  Again the evidence is there.  If I had my white scale, I would be levelling and I would not be pissed at Vallis Scortor, and you would still have a good bard.<br>
<br>
Oh and one more thing, you can shut me out of the guild.  Like I really care.  Who wants to be associated with a bunch of people that have leadership that is failure prone and willing to accept being a failure.  But you cannot stop me from being what I want to be.  I will own this one day.  And I will stand proud that I accomplished what I set out to do, proud that I have benefited the group and guild that will support the move I make, by providing them the powers I have.  Ask Alyenbomb where we first met.  If he remembers, it was in MistMoore and I was trying to get the final piece for my Lambent BP at level 28, which complete the final piece of the lambent armor quest.  I did not cheat and run out and buy it.  And I wore it proudly till Level 50 because it was something that I had done. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=benielsongweaver>Beniel Songweaver</A> at: 12/21/01 7:18:13 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucrydeeossiriand.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crydee Ossiriand</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local Resident</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/21/01 6:29:12 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.questing-ranger.com/images/basic/epics.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: They said give up your Epic.</span><hr size=1> I had my epic pre-Vision, but it's a case in point that I got it because other rangers wanted me to have it and not because of some guild.<br>
<br>
I started the quest at L47. I did everything that I could on my own and even bought a Jade Reaver for the really high price of 2K. The guild I was with was going through inner turmoil and was well on its way to falling apart.<br>
<br>
By the time December 2000 came around, I got dragged off Karana by a pair of rangers [Fandros and Barnard] in Nightmare Clan who also got me in the guild even though technically I was too low and didn't have the right resistances. While with them; I got East Karana done and got the Hate drop from Innoruuk himself. The guild raids Plane of Sky, but I was moving in RL so Fandros loots it for me.<br>
<br>
I end up meeting a ranger from a guild call Darkwind, and he helps me get the VS drop. I honestly don't even remember his name at this point.<br>
<br>
All I need is a trip to The Hole and a MQ then I'm done. Then Nightmare Clan disbands one day before The Hole raid and Barnard quits the game. Crydee is sad. =( I spent the next month trying to organize and/or just tag along on raids to this place.<br>
<br>
I was also getting tells daily from others of my class who just wanted to provide moral support, many of which created a character on Ayonae Ro just to come visit me. [I couldn't even try to list everyone as I would definately forget people, but I still remember the converstaion with the ranger Kivorn of Eternal Wrath.]<br>
<br>
Jzonn (another ranger) invites me to go down The Hole with Final Destiny. [ok - a cute bard was involved too, but she was very ranger-friendly.] Anyway, the first day doesn't go so well and the raid wipes out. Then next day the ranger Sorack (who knew about the FD raid) shows up with a bunch from Vallis Scortor. He kinda takes over leading the way down to the ranger mob which we end up doing about 4 times.<br>
<br>
Oh and Fandros (who is now with Eternal Wrath at this point) was still holding that plane of sky drop to multiquest with me after all that time.<br>
<br>
When I get my epics, it is March 2001. I am level 53 and unguilded. Although I got a lot of help from guilds getting it done, I got mine because my class in general wanted me to have them and not because of any one guild.<br>
